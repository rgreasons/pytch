Just when you think he’s slinging the same Biblical imagery <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Johnny Cash</a> foretold on “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1331-american-iv-the-man-comes-around/"">The Man Comes Around</a>”, Simpson adds that he “Met Buddha yet another time/ And he showed me a glowing light within.” Rather than parrot the same Christian ideology that most country musicians consider integral to the genre, this Kentucky-born singer-songwriter is a quester, intrigued by the metaphysics of spiritual experience and wondering aloud if the Bible and a handful of 'shrooms will lead you to the same religious epiphany. This isn’t country music to put on when you want to stare at your hand for three hours—well, it is, but it’s more than that.</p>
<p>Simpson’s true subject isn’t the “reptile aliens made of light” who “cut you open and pull out all your pain,” although that’s a great line for a country song. Instead, he’s much more preoccupied on “Turtles” and throughout the nine songs that follow, with a much more earthly and everyday emotion: “Love’s the only thing that ever saved my life.” Perhaps it’s because his steely voice turns surprisingly tender when he sings that line, or perhaps because his Mellotron player provides a bed of strings as nebulous as the Milky Way—but somehow Simpson pulls it off without sounding pretentious, schmaltzy, or dangerous.</p>
<p>With a sharp mind to match that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1872-merle-haggard/"">Hag</a> burr of a voice, Simpson not only owns the best name in current country music but comprehends the genre as a vehicle for big, unwieldy ideas about human consciousness and the nature of life. He got Pope portraitist <a href=""http://jasonseiler.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jason Seiler</a> to do the cover art, and Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are thanked in the liner notes. Nashville rarely sounds so trippy as it does on <i>Metamodern Sounds in Country Music</i>, whose title alludes to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8317-ray-charles/"">Ray Charles</a> by way of <a href=""http://sethabramson.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seth Abramson</a>. It’s heady stuff, and potentially insufferable, too, if Simpson wasn’t able to keep everything down to earth. He favors clear melodies, careful structures, and riffs that draw on Nashville and Bakersfield traditions without sounding revivalist. Nothing else on <i>Metamodern </i>is quite so bold or quite so dense as “Turtles All the Way Down”, but Simpson comes across as a man deeply dissatisfied with the easy answers country music typically passes along as wisdom.</p>
<p>As “Long White Line” dissipates into a blast of spacey distortion, Laur Joamets’ slide guitar sounds like a spacecraft taking off, but the song itself is tightly structured and moored to some dusty honkytonk on Planet Earth. Only on the penultimate track does he really blast into the cosmos: “It Ain’t All Flowers” begins as a stark self-reckoning at the bathroom mirror, then dissolves into a bizarre sci-fi jam full of backwards guitars, parallel-universe synths, and fragmented drum beats. Immediately after that song fades, Simpson launches into the hidden bonus track, “Pan Bowl”, which drops us back in some remote Kentucky holler. It’s the most traditionally nostalgic moment on <i>Metamodern Sounds</i>, full of soft-focus memories of four generations of Simpsons, and the acoustic austerity only underscores sharpness of the songcraft and the vividness of the details. He may be a big thinker, but when it comes to the primacy of the song in country music, Simpson is a traditionalist. There are no extraneous sounds or ideas here, nothing that’s not battened down to a carefully structured set of lyrics and melodies.</p>
<p>As a result, the best moment here may be the most unlikely: a cover of the 1988 post-New Wave hit “The Promise” by When in Rome. Simpson slows it down to a crawl, yet this isn’t one of those reinterpretations that purports to find deeper meaning through a more tasteful “Mad World” reimagining. The melody is tricky, especially divorced from that familiar piano line, but Simpson delivers it with gentle stalwartness, testifying powerfully to the magnitude of love. The Mellotron string section swoops in to add some earthly drama to an emotion that might just explain the entire universe. </p></div>"|19386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19386-sturgill-simpson-metamodern-sounds-in-country-music/|7.7|Stephen M.

The Atlanta-based producer (also known as Wes Gray) makes music that has qualities similar to that peculiar element: the music obfuscates its origins, has an untenable aspect to its sound and, well, it sounds better when you’re smoking something on a basement couch, at once digging the beat while similarly forgetting just what it is you’re listening to.</p>
<p>Gray’s debut album was released on the Washington, D.C. imprint Peoples Potential Unlimited in 2012 without much in the way of cover art, or even song titles. Much like the other releases on that imprint, Moon B’s music favors miasma over certainty, avoiding easy genre characterization while also drawing on distinct musical tropes of the early 1980s. Much like his fellow labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19084-benedek-untitled-ep/"">Benedek</a>, the music that Moon B releases is made from a mix of hardware, drum machines and samples of cheap 12”s that might never get ID’d by anyone beyond the most obscure of DJs.</p>
<p>In some ways, Moon B’s new album, <i>II</i>, is a step up: the production is a little crisper, the tracks have titles, and there’s actually sleeve art, in this case a peculiar painting of an African-American man standing in the middle of the road at night, a chicken in one hand, his other raised in a fist. Not much is expanded upon beyond that, though, and while the music itself has grown trickier, it hasn’t ranged far from what he laid down on his first singles.</p>
<p>Opener “Gulls” begins with the sound of eerie analog keyboards from <i>Music has the Right to Children</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> before canned handclaps take over, the track meandering into such disparate zones as synth-funk, '80s B-boy soundtracks, and smooth jazz without ever quite landing in one: pop and lock to it, or else just chill until the track dissolves back into white noise. The album standout is also the track with the best title: “Stank Tartare.” The synth bass is queasy and deep and slightly warped, as if originating from an obscure funk tape left on the dashboardone summer afternoon. “Green Sky” has the kind of stiff yet rubberbanding rhythm to it that connects the dots between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> and Whodini.</p>
<p>Funk, soul, boogie, jazz, R&amp;B, electro, New Age, even touches of house music: all sorts of familiar yet unmoored sounds emerge from Moon B’s haze, and nothing remains in focus for long. When some tracks begin, it already seems like they have the potential to take divergent paths, from a thumping house track or else a woozy early garage house instrumental—or, if it's Moon B's wish, a narrow path between the two.</p>
<p>Yet, in touching on all these genres and running them through all sorts of samplers and drum machines (among the listed equipment used: Kawai K1, ESQ-1, Roland Alpha Juno 1, Yamaha DX21, Korg Microsampler, Tascam 424), there’s one thing curiously absent from the above list of genres: hip-hop. His working methods are not dissimilar from any post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a> hip-hop producers, but Moon B presents a parallel world in which hip-hop never happened, where the beats are dope but not dope enough where someone would drop rhymes atop them. I wonder how these tracks might change with someone else on them, but for now, the music produces an uncanny feeling, like the presence of smoke but no real fire. </p></div>"|19357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19357-moon-b-ii/|6.9|Andy Beta

Jackson was a perfectionist about his music, and he recorded many more songs than he ever released. That means that there's a lot of unreleased material in his archives; <i>Michael</i> appeared in 2010, and now we've got this strange, underfed, vaguely horrid eight-song record, inexplicably named after the group that had a hit with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_BTEFAVwjU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Just Kickin' It""</a>. It's a set of outtakes and misfires that Jackson recorded in the 20th century, freshly ""re-produced"" by L.A. Reid, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a>, and others to sound as if he'd just shown up to make a new record in a contemporary style.</p>
<p>That, it should be noted, is a trick that's been tried before with Jackson's music. When Motown overdubbed and remixed some of his decade-old factory seconds in 1984, it yielded the <i>Farewell My Summer Love</i> album, whose packaging briefly fooled a few people into thinking it was the follow-up to <i>Thriller</i>. It's true that the new versions sound more modern and souped-up than the originals (which you also get if you buy the ""deluxe edition"" of <i>Xscape</i>), but their producers don't have enough distance from Jackson's presence to reframe his voice the way that, say, Junkie XL's remix of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0vXxH1IEmQ&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Little Less Conversation</a>"" reframed Elvis Presley's.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that the outtakes they're dealing with are several tiers below the stuff that ended up on Jackson's later albums—maybe the estate is trying to parcel out the best material over time, maybe it doesn't get any better than this. ""A Place with No Name"" is Jackson's rewrite of America's two-chord wonder ""A Horse with No Name"", which is a bad enough idea on its own; Stargate, who produced the new version, replace the signature guitar riff with a sugary electroswing arrangement, but it doesn't help. Most of these tracks are Jackson hiccuping and <i>eee-hee</i>-ing on autopilot through underdeveloped semi-tunes; both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0XLzIswI2s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grace Jones</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPYSdnDiwRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MC Lyte</a> beat him to the title ""Slave to the Rhythm"" with much better songs. (The version here is not <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuAs4H1bE-4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the one with Justin Bieber</a> that leaked a while back.)</p>
<p>Jackson liked to present himself as pop's eternally youthful Peter Pan. In truth, he was more its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit,_Run"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rabbit Angstrom</a>, forever re-enacting his moment of moonwalking glory from a position of ever-increasing bitterness. Defensive, brittle songs like <i>Xscape</i>'s title track (""don't you try to tell me what is right for me!"") don't look good on anyone. The most embarrassing song here, though, is ""Do You Know Where Your Children Are"", a <i>Dangerous</i> outtake that apparently never got finished. (If Jackson knew what the bridge's lyrics were going to be, he wasn't letting on in the recording studio.) It's a finger-jabbing harangue about a 12-year-old runaway who's ""tired of stepdaddy using her/ Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her"" and ends up hooking on Sunset Boulevard. As courageously stand-taking as it was for Jackson to indicate that he opposed child abuse, it might not have been wise for his estate to release a song in which he's getting all sanctimonious about that particular topic. (The shred-by-numbers guitar solo that ends the new version doesn't do the song any favors either.)</p>
<p>The one keeper on <i>Xscape</i> is its opener, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55022-iheartradio-premieres-posthumous-michael-jackson-song-love-never-felt-so-good/"">Love Never Felt So Good</a>"", which is also its oldest song—it dates from 1983 or so—and the one that's been in circulation the longest: written by Jackson and Paul Anka, it <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPyOCS0xccM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">initially surfaced</a> on a 1984 Johnny Mathis album. It's got the best Jackson vocal here, too. The original take, which is mostly just his voice, fingersnaps and a piano, showcases the kind of  gravity-defying singing-for-pleasure that we barely heard from him in the post-<i>Thriller</i> era. The deluxe version of <i>Xscape </i>appends a Timbaland-produced <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wnuTGGuAVs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of ""Love Never Felt So Good"" on which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Timberlake</a> sings along with the old tape, featuring disco flourishes borrowed from Jackson's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvSeXisGDc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Working Day and Night""</a>. It sounds pleasantly like an echo of good Michael Jackson, but the fact that sampling an even earlier Jackson song makes it sound <i>more contemporary</i> says something about how wrongheaded this entire project is. </p></div>"|19333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19333-michael-jackson-xscape/|4.1|Douglas Wolk

When the Kentucky trio emerged in 2006, they were, as their name suggested, survivors of a dead act, the twisting-and-scraping, post-hardcore band Breather Resist. That previous group’s musical skeleton stuck with Young Widows, especially for their hurdling tantrum of a debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9853-settle-down-city/""><i>Settle Down City</i></a>. That album presented a coiled mix of hardcore acrobatics and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">Jesus Lizard</a> menace, a Breather Resist continuation with less screaming and more variety. Young Widows didn’t discard that framework so much as build on top of it: Increasingly, with 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12173-old-wounds/""><i>Old Wounds </i></a>and 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15342-in-and-out-of-youth-and-lightness/""><i>In and Out of Youth and Lightness</i></a>, they used the heaviness of their past as a foundation for a flexible stylistic composite—noise-rock against shoegaze against hardcore, math-rock against post-rock against a little industrial. With polar dynamics, lower tempos and a generally softer approach, <i>Lightness</i> took the variety to surprising extremes, issuing an apology of sorts for the mutilating abrasion of the trio’s past.</p>
<p>But <i>Easy Pain</i>, Young Widows’ fourth album, swings the balance back toward belligerence and volume, and the wallop doesn’t arrive in the manner you might expect. Of Young Widows’ four albums, <i>Easy Pain </i>is the hardest to track and trace <i>and</i> the best overall. These eight tracks push quickly past pleasant and perfunctory intros (vestiges of the last record’s rather moody approach) to arrive at relentless, loaded, loud rock songs. The rhythm section lands mostly like fists on a shaky table, and the guitars aim to fill every corner of the room with distortion and echo, as plangent riffs are given a wide berth. “Gift of Failure” opens with a soft bit of kaleidoscopic electric guitar, refracted and repeated through effects. But when the drums arrive, the only direction the trio aims for the next four minutes is forwards. Tense and tired, Evan Patterson struggles against an almost barbaric rumble to deliver the tale of a blind man blessed and cursed with his condition: “Nothing to see that hasn’t been seen for days,"" he manages, his voice slipping between a scream and a sigh that barely worms through the distortion.<i> </i>For a band initially known for snap-back song structures and zipping tempos, <i>Easy Pain </i>presents a lumbering, unleashed beast—not at all stupid or simplified, just deliberate.</p>
<p>But the reason these songs work so well isn't just because of their volume and muscle. More than their predecessors, these Young Widows tunes refute the validity of the reductive descriptors that have always trailed the trio, from post-hardcore to noise rock to misanthropic Midwestern indie. <i>Easy Pain</i> denies that these things are distinguishable at all, that one strain can function without another. The slurred speak-sing of Patterson during “Bird Feeder” suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a> backed by a power trio out to overwhelm him, but there’s a roaring slide guitar solo at the song’s center and delirious stop-time lunges near the end. Those pieces make unlikely counterparts, but they make “Bird Feeder” a seamless and compelling brute. “Godman” recalls one of those old hardcore nods, drugged on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a> and sent shrieking into the busy streets.</p>
<p>There’s no better illustration of this mix—and maybe no better song in Young Widows’ catalogue—than the diabolical “Kerosene Girl.” The guitar and bass are down-tuned and dense, their march as thick as a bit of primo sludge metal. Through the din, though, Patterson webs a slender, agile melody, his little riff suggesting the lurid garage rock of the Swami stable. But the real esprit comes in the unexpected drum part—a daunting, four-on-the-floor stomp that fights across the song’s length to not collapse on itself. It’s, of all things, <i>danceable</i>. Patterson <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/News/young_widows_explain_destructive_nature_of_easy_pain"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted recently</a> that he lifted the beat from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyl2gkT1gFs&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hamilton Bohannon’s “Dance Your Ass Off,”</a> a swivel-and-clap 1976 disco cut about a party that refuses to let go of the night. “Kerosene Girl” even takes a sly, sinister turn on that idea, detailing the evening of a misanthrope so awkward he follows a woman home and burns down her house, rather than simply speak to her on the dance floor. Such depravity winds through much of <i>Easy Pain</i>, a record where people burn alive, vultures pluck at the not-quite-dead and original sin brands already-leathered skin. There’s anxiety in Patterson’s voice, sure, an unease that suggests this music is always being made at the lip of an abyss. But these lyrics read like death metal, where victims are mocked and a tension between distinct wills powers an often-mortal conflict. </p>
<p>As members of Breather Resist and Young Widows, bassist Nick Thieneman and singer and guitarist Patterson have played together for a dozen years. It’s surprising and inspiring that, even now, they’re still moving not just ahead but into their own space, too, a singular approach that feels definitively like Young Widows. <i>Easy Pain </i>is the closest they’ve ever come—so much so, in fact, that the record sags briefly toward the end from its own weighted consistency. But on the whole, <i>Easy Pain </i>is athletic and aggressive like the old material, dramatic and adventurous like the new goods. At last, Young Widows sound less like a string of hyphenates and histories and more like their own demented, delightful selves.</p></div>"|19233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19233-young-widows-easy-pain/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

A founding member of Bay Area collective Heartbreak Gang, he produced Loverance's “Up!” and contributed to <a href=""https://twitter.com/SageTheGemini"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sage the Gemini</a>’s viral-turned-Top 40 hit “Gas Pedal”. His nasal smooth-talking has factored in West Coast rap’s return to the mainstream, and his debut LP, <i>Sincerely Yours</i>, is Su’s opportunity to move forward through the doors he's already opened.<br/><br/><i>Sincerely Yours</i> picks up where Su’s <i>Kilt</i> mixtape series left off, with the young Bay Area rapper looking for a deeper niche beyond weekend party-soundtracking tracks. The album opens wistfully, with Su quoting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9055-pimp-c/"">Pimp C</a>'s verse on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay Z</a>’s “Big Pimpin’”, but his interpolation of “Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall” is bashful, a deviation from Pimp C's snarl. Later, on “Girls”, he waxes on taking his dream girl on dates that involve smoking weed and hanging out with his parents. Su’s everyman persona situates afield of Los Angeles’ gangster revivalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg"">YG</a>, as his music possesses an insular quality that places him outside of rap's larger-than-life personas.<br/><br/>Iamsu!'s numerous guest verses typically find him ready to turn up at any function, but <i>Sincerely Yours</i> finds him turning down at every opportunity. “Only That Real”, produced by HBK member P-Lo, could fit on any ratchet mix from the last few years with its moody synths and vicious stomp, but appearances by a bored-sounding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a> and Sage the Gemini dull this potential hit. Though Su has appeared and produced some big crossover singles, <i>Sincerely Yours</i> is a bit too blunted, as a majority of the album floats in its own haze. “What You ‘Bout"" offers a nice slap to the record's drowsy consciousness, momentum that the album could use more of. <br/><br/></p>
<p>As a whole, <i>Sincerely Yours</i> maintains a tepid pace; the record's more thrilling moments are undercut by perfunctory rapping and weak track sequencing. After an unnecessary interlude, there's a string of energetic posse cuts that feature HBK members Kool John and Skipper (“Back on Your Mind”) and Bay Area legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6299-too-hort"">Too $hort</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"">E-40</a> (“T.W.D.Y.”), but on an album that often gets too comfortable in its own relaxed mood, <i>Sincerely Yours </i>could use more rappers with outspoken personas to act as a foil for Su.</p>
<p>Iamsu! remains a distant figure on <i>Sincerely Yours</i>, but there's a charm in the constant amazement he expresses regarding his success thus far. Furthermore, his ruminations on unrequited love lack expected bitterness, as he instead seeks to understand his complicated feelings. “Ascension” starts with Su pumping himself up by running down all of the things that he’s accomplished over the last few years, but then comes “Runaway”, a distorted back-and-forth with a former lover that ends with him singing, “I thought you loved me.”</p>
<p>These are not insurmountable struggles, but other rappers have found universal appeal with far less relatable issues. “Problems” finds Su putting on the backpack of a conscious rapper, trying to weave his own issues with the problems of black people in America. The sentiment is nice, but he doesn't the passion in his voice to sell a track of such a weight. Su might not have the highest aspirations, but minor dreams can still compel a listener; <i>Sincerely Yours</i> just needed to find better modes of expression.</p></div>"|19230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19230-iamsu-sincerely-yours/|6.0|David Turner

But Vivian Girls are no more, meaning Goodman’s instincts have run in a less solitary direction for <i>Hour of the Dawn</i>, La Sera’s third album.

Not that she’s suddenly gone mean. </span><i>Hour of the Dawn </i><span>is largely made up of romantic songs carried to their open-hearted potential by Goodman’s high, floating voice. She’s in love with people and with memories, from summer’s promise to the town that used to be filled with her friends. An album that could be sad based on the lyric sheet is stuffed with delirious fret runs, muscular drum fills, sunny guitars soaked with reverb. Vivian Girls’ girl group harmonies were usually cloaked behind a curtain of feedback. Here, Goodman stands in front of the band, her voice shining like a lighthouse on the shore.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Lesley Gore-fronting-Black Flag comparison is apt, since you could imagine the tougher directions the music would lean toward were Goodman’s instincts for melancholy and tenderness not there to soften the impact. The resulting sound is closer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a> with more focus on the jamming. “Kiss This Town Away” leans into surf rock and a country singer’s sense of lament; the nimble picking of the title track builds to a triumphant outro even as she expresses unease about whether a new day will really bring something better. “10 Headed Goat Wizard” is straight-up Beatlesesque pop, like something you’d hear at the end of an episode of “Mad Men” and not even realize it was anachronistic.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The moments where she lets the band get heavier are interesting: “Control” chants like the flip side of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2” while “Storm’s End” groans like its title, which is possibly a “Game of Thrones” reference (which Goodman has talked about in interviews) but probably doesn’t need to be read into beyond that. (Or does it? Okay, it doesn’t.) That’s when Goodman takes steps toward establishing herself beyond what she’s known for, which is personable if not always easy to distinguish from itself. <i>Hour of the Dawn</i> sounds like a summer record, meant to be played when emotions are high and the sun is out. Most importantly, it shows what she’s capable of when the shine has worn off.</p></div>"|19268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19268-la-sera-hour-of-the-dawn/|7.1|Jeremy Gordon

The label's cofounder and figurehead, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, has the aspect of a regular dude and peddles his music as such: High art for daily use.  </p>
<p>Enter Dan Hayhurst and Reuben Sutherland, whose Software debut as Sculpture, <i>Membrane Pop</i>, plays like theme music for a cartoon parents might catch out of the corner of their eye and momentarily worry about what their children are being exposed to. Its beats are blocky and intricate, its textures rubbery and its melodic lines rendered as simply as ringtones. It's music in a tradition that reaches back to Jean-Jacques Perrey and Gershon Kingsley, whose compositions were painstaking efforts of tape-splicing and synthesizer manipulation that ended up with names like ""Barnyard in Orbit"". More recently, it's a course followed by people like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"">Black Dice</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5389-eric-copeland/"">Eric Copeland</a>: artists for whom silliness is an earnest endeavor.</p>
<p><i>Pop</i> is an aspirational title, sometimes accurate and sometimes a little misleading. The concept, presumably, is music where immediacy and catchiness will transcend whatever weirdness gets in its way. Tracks like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHlxtDlvrHQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hackle Scam Populator""</a> and ""Symbolic Molecule"" do this; tracks like ""5 Seconds in the Future is a You Made of Pure Thought"" are still playful but much more abstract. Generally, it's the friendlier side of the record that feels more interesting because it has higher stakes: How, it wonders, can you make music that will register to most listeners as avant-garde while still retaining the approachability and charm of something less precious? <i>Pop</i>'s harsher moments have their own ingenious little logic but ironically, the more difficult the album gets the more familiar it feels.</p>
<p>Sculpture bill themselves as an ""opto-musical agglomeration,"" which is to say that the visual aspect of their performance is as important to them as their music. Live, Reuben Sutherland screens wild, hectic patterns using simple devices like the kaleidoscope and zoetrope, which tricks the eye into seeing rapidly cycled static images as motion. Sutherland, who works in part as a director of commercials for companies like Adidas and IKEA, probably has higher-tech tricks in his arsenal, but that's not the point. Instead, the image, like the music, has a certain kidlike purity, aiming for complex ideas as simply as possible. </p></div>"|19334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19334-sculpture-membrane-pop/|6.9|Mike Powell

But in 2014, this works in their favor: with no classic hanging over their heads and no true expectations, it's easy to be seduced by their quietly fantastic fourth album <i>White Women</i>.<br/><br/>One reason why the two have endured (and still kicking on a major label, no less) is the strength of their songwriting. No Chromeo album has ever quite struck the perfect balance between playing it straight and letting irony seep to the surface, but the bedrock of this group is its chops: the ability to write tunes good enough to justify the shtick. Yet, as the shtick has become less important—no longer a selling or conversation point, it is what it is—the songs have gotten stronger, which is clear from <i>White Women</i> opener ""Jealous (I Ain't With It)"", a song powered by chunky, ringing guitar chords.</p>
<p>In an interview, P-Thugg said Chromeo rejected the riff (written by the production duo Oliver) for being ""too Katy Perry"", but pop looks good on Chromeo: the guitar-powered first verse slides right into a soaring chorus that's immediately one of the most obviously catchy hooks the band has ever written. Elsewhere, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"">Toro y Moi</a> collaboration ""Come Alive"" quickly returns to Chromeo's electrofunk roots. Still, it's not just a classic Chromeo song, but a <i>classic</i> Chromeo song, with rippling guitar lines and plucked bass that give way to a slick, multi-layered chorus.<br/><br/>Though <i>White Women</i> starts in an uptempo mindset, the album's strength lies in its softer, more vulnerable moments. There's always been a humanity behind Chromeo's carefully constructed facade—a sweet, almost fumbling, open-heartedness that allows you to connect with the guys behind the characters—and earnestness has never worked better for them than it does here. ""Lost on the Way Home"" is a crystalline duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"">Solange</a> about always having your partner's back that features a perfect, aching outro; ""Ezra's Interlude"", named for and featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a>'s Ezra Koenig, is a fluttering trifle that's nonetheless a powerful hit of straight pathos. ""Old 45s"" is about dancing to a jukebox, and it has a slowly cascading chorus that tugs at your heartstrings along with a guitar solo that pokes you in the side.<br/><br/><i>White Women</i> is the closest Chromeo have come yet to fully realizing their sound, but it's also far from perfect. Lead single ""Sexy Socialite"" is retrograde on a number of levels—from composition to worldview, it feels like a leftover from that <i>She's In Control</i>—and its final third needlessly drags. Still, even though closer ""Fall Back 2U"" rubs up against the six-minute mark, it's still a great song with slicing disco strings and a tricky chorus melody. It also serves as a reminder that Chromeo, even on its most emotionally resonant album, are jokesters, too: the track ends with a sax solo, a vocoder solo and a choir. It shouldn't work so well, but it does—which, in Chromeo's tenth year of existence, also applies to the band's approach.</p></div>"|19337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19337-chromeo-white-women/|7.6|Jordan Sargent

Rap and dance music are both direct descendents of disco and funk, and over the years they collided a number of times to produce a number of stylistic hybrids: hip-house in the 1980s, drum'n'bass in the '90s, crunk in the '00s. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The possibilities for stylistic crossovers have especially been numerous in the South, where danceability's practically been a requirement in rap's playbook; recently, big-room dance music has crashed into trap-rap to produce a noisy collision of genres called simply “trap”. So far, the trap phenomenon has been largely confined to EDM's world, where the micro-genre's attracted the attention of ravers and college kids alike—but rappers are taking interest, too. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"">Waka Flocka Flame</a>’s recently been collaborating with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6293-flosstradamus/"">Flosstradamus</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6154-lil-jon/"">Lil Jon</a>’s collaboration with French trap producer DJ Snake, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUDVMiITOU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Turn Down For What”</a>, is currently holding court on the Billboard Hot 100.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Suffolk, Va. rap producer Lex Luger’s booming, large-format beats for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross"">Rick Ross</a> and Flocka have singlehandedly provided a substantial amount of the raw material for trap’s development, and he’s finally started to explore the genre that he accidentally had a hand in creating through a collaboration with EDM demigod <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5254-a-trak/"">A-Trak</a>. Their first EP as Low Pros is the best kind of team-up record, where two artists with two very different aesthetics get together and find common ground by throwing everything they have against the wall. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>EP 1</i> is an ambitious recording, but it sounds comfortably loose, too. A-Trak and Luger don't bother to decide whether they're making rap-influenced EDM or EDM-influenced rap, instead choosing to try out both approaches over the course of the EP's seven tracks. In both areas, they achieve a level of success: “100 Bottles”, with vocals by Travi$ Scott, takes the regally bombastic orchestral horn hits that have defined some of Luger’s best work and straps them to an equally grandiouse Dutch house synth, exploding into something that should ideally be heard on the arena-sized sound system of a large-scale corporate rave. “Jack Tripper”, one of three tracks featuring rising Atlanta rap producer Metro Boomin, sounds just like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> song laced with a squelching acid-house-ish keyboard.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On a few tracks, Luger and A-Trak’s contributions transcend the sum of their parts. The beat on “Frankie Lymon” fuses a moire pattern of anxious trap triplets to a sweeping widescreen melody that'd sound great as a transcendent peak of a DJ set. ""Frankie Lymon"" is topped by an unshakably catchy hook by Que of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH79_OxpqK0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“OG Bobby Johnson”</a> fame; Que compares himself to tragic R&amp;B pioneer Frankie Lymon and brags about being unable to feel love, and it's equal to nearly anything on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19221-future-honest/""><i>Honest</i></a> in pushing Southern rap further out into its ongoing heartache-and-darkness phase. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Muscle,” another track featuring Metro Boomin, gets closer than any other track on <i>EP 1</i> in terms of finding the sweet spot between A-Trak's and Luger’s individual styles: it’s a neon-streaked amalgamation of snappy, uptempo drums, garishly neon-streaked keyboards, and motivational vocals from a rejuvenated-sounding Juvenile. ""Muscle"" could work equally well in a Southern strip club or an EDM festival, but it and, by extension, the rest of <i>EP 1</i> gives off the impression that Low Pros would never ask you to choose which event you'd rather attend, instead setting their sights on finding the happiest medium between the two poles.</span></p></div>"|19365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19365-low-pros-ep-1/|6.7|Miles Raymer

She is an expatriate, a Swede in London; the frustrated child of an absent father; involved in a transatlantic, long-distance relationship; a surviving friend to the dead. She doubts her own work ethic, criticizing herself for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the things she hasn't yet achieved</a>. The most curious element about the singer, however, the quality that makes her such a uniquely captivating vocalist, is the way she communicates these troubles—with a honeyed, masterfully wielded croon that leaves you with the impression she's comforting <i>you </i>about them.</p>
<p>It's that groovy, gentle-voiced extroversion that drives her debut LP <i>Yellow Memories</i>, a collection of ""<a href=""http://www.okayfuture.com/features/fatima-yellow-memories-eglo-records-exclusive-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">all soul music</a>"" that oscillates from genre to genre in keeping with the traditions of Eglo Records, the eclectic family of artists assembled by electronic producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28145-floating-points/"">Floating Points</a> and label head Alexander Nut. Stylistically, Fatima could be compared to forebears <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu"">Erykah Badu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6752-jill-scott/"">Jill Scott</a> and even—at her most whimsical—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/"">Janelle Monáe</a>, but her delivery exudes a light sweetness, even when confronting heartbreak. She tackles the gamut of modern emotion: dissatisfaction and stagnancy, filial piety, the joys of self-actualization, the effects of technology, distance and the gutting loss attached to it. Despite the emotional breadth, <i>Yellow Memories </i>radiates a feel-good grace that doesn't encompass the listener in her despair, instead evoking the type of empathy one might feel towards a good friend.</p>
<p>Stylistically, <i>Yellow Memories</i> sounds adventurous thanks to a teeming roster of collaborators that includes Detroit house musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"">Theo Parrish</a>, producer Scoop DeVille (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/""> </a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4102-snoop-dogg/"">Snoop Dogg</a>), and Floating Points' own <a href=""http://eglorecords.com/author/flopoensemble/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">16-piece orchestral ensemble</a>. The record is steeped in stylistic experimentation; she experiments with lyrical cadence and time signatures, as though simultaneously trying to prove her mettle and ravenously absorbing every genre she can get her hands on. ""Riding Round (Sky High),"" the DeVille cut, experiments with Middle Eastern samples and slick electro production, while ""Gave Me My Name,"" a stripped-down jazz ballad about her estranged dad, features only piano and vocals; ""La Neta"" thumps with a more classic R&amp;B flow, while overlong opener ""Do Better"" is pure soul, a bombastic yet self-critical cut complete with backup vocals and horn section. She's especially fond of tight, often dissonant vocal harmonics, as on the gorgeous a cappella benediction ""Sun, Star, Solar""; her technical ability makes those moments some of her best.</p>
<p>In part thanks to its stylistic diversity, <i>Yellow Memories</i> lacks a cohesive narrative. Furthermore, Fatima's uncomplicated, rarely forceful voice is forced to take a backseat to the lush, elaborate production; indeed, if it weren't for her blithely mesmerizing voice—the spine that weaves its way through the album's dozen songs, supporting each rib with its breathy control and branding it all as hers, even when it's overshadowed—it could easily be mistaken for a showcase compilation rather than a fully-formed solo album.</p>
<p>While <i>Yellow Memories</i> is an impressive collection, it isn't a particularly commanding work. The good news is that, while this might have been a damnable offense in the hierarchies of the pop cultural past, Fatima luckily appears in an era that extols and rewards the eclectic, the adaptive, and the unfatalistic. Those are the qualities that shine through in full force on her first effort, and they're what will give her inertia. She's a motivated, deeply talented chameleon and her unique sincerity resonates, which means that while her work still posesses some awkward adolescent elbows, its maker is far from grown.</p></div>"|19309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19309-fatima-yellow-memories/|6.8|Devon Maloney

It’s a cheeky assessment of someone’s inscrutability, possibly his own. Throughout the last decade Toth has released a steady stream of rangy folk, rock, and folk-rock records under various guises. Wooden Wand is his most popular nom de studio, often paired with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31850-wooden-wand-the-world-war-iv/"">World War IV</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4665-wooden-wand-and-the-vanishing-voice/"">the Vanishing Voice</a> or just shortened to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27851-wand/"">Wand</a>. There are even a few album under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6466-james-jackson-toth/"">Christian name</a>. What distinguishes one alias from another? Maybe he’s just being cryptic, or perhaps it’s a defense mechanism against an industry that has not been especially kind to him. Before landing at current label home Fire, for whom he has done some strong work lately, Toth bounced around from one label to another (I count at least eight), attracting a loyal but small audience.</p>
<p>While it lacks the import of a statement record like last year’s excellent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17489-blood-oaths-of-the-new-blues/"">Blood Oaths of the New Blues</a></i>, <i>Farmer’s Corner</i> sounds like Toth is adjusting to his role as a cult figure among cult figures. “I have reached an uneasy peace, a way to kind of go home,” he songs on “Uneasy Peace”. “Ramblin’ the backroads, like I got a buzz on.” With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a> as his spirit guide, he's settling into a career as a musical grazer, moving from one patch of green to the next. He wanders from one style to another, then to another—all within the surprisingly wide confines of Americana. It’s not just his sound but his entire sensibility that changes from one album to the next, making him as chameleonic than fellow collector of aliases <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a>. Yet his grazing instinct informs a large, impressive, and almost haphazardly diverse catalog that doesn’t defy expectations as much as it preempts them.</p>
<p>If there is an album that sounds most like Toth—or, most like Toth making a statement album—it’s probably <i>Blood Oaths</i>, which he recorded with a cast of Birmingham, Ala. musicians that included members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4471-verbena/"">Verbena</a> and the underrated Delicate Cutters. Arguably his best work—and certainly his best album of the decade thus far—it was vividly crafted to balance tight song structures and ramblin’ performances. On it, Toth sang and played with the kind of life-or-death focus of a guy who only makes one album a decade, rather than two or three a year. So <i>Farmer’s Corner</i> sounds like a reaction to that album, both in process and in result. Where <i>Blood Oaths</i> broods, <i>Corner</i> is bright and sometimes even defiantly optimistic. Where the former took pains to reimagine blues and roots tropes, the latter is enjoyably modest and seems to take no small joy in the simple act of making music.</p>
<p>Rather than book time in a professional studio and suffer the usual tedium of a recording session, Toth took a piecemeal approach to crafting <i>Farmer’s Corner</i>. He recorded whenever and wherever the muse struck: St. Louis, Nashville, Lexington, Kentucky. His makeshift band is comprised of friends who were available: guitar players <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a> and Doc Feldman as well as bassist Darin Gray. The first Wooden Wand album actually produced by Toth, it’s no lo-fi loaf, but a woolly collection of rustic folk tunes, some electrified but most austerely acoustic. It sounds tossed off in the best way: loose, breezy, seemingly impromptu, with little calculation and even less fuss.</p>
<p>On “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16744-dambuilding/"">Dambuilding</a>”, with its emphatic strums and pensive melody, Toth carefully describes the process of choosing the biggest rocks, piling them properly to block a stream, and digging out the dry riverbed so he can bury “everything I can stand to lose.” Despite the subtle hints percussion and pedal steel, he sounds solitary in this curious work, singing the tune like it’s a summation of the emotional and psychological stakes of songwriting. A rare glimpse into Toth’s creative process, the song plays like a mission statement, both revealing and elusive. As its title suggests, <i>Farmer’s Corner</i> is an album about labor and its rewards, about wanderlust and rootlessness, about memory and regret, yet for most of its fifty minutes, its mood is affable and laidback—as though Toth wants to make it all look easy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The loping pace of the music suggests movement and travel, a determined shuffle down a winding path. The bass is a crucial instrument in this regard, as the various players become one-man rhythm sections pushing these tunes along. On ""Uneasy Peace"" an upright bass is paired with a Moog bass to create a buoyantly melodic undergirding that practically quotes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5721-otis-redding/"">Otis Redding</a>’s “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay”. <i>Farmer’s Corner</i> only stumbles when it strays from its amiable acoustic sound: Darin Gray adds some muscle to the eddying electric riffs of “Adie”, but can’t rescue the thorny electric jam. Without drums, the song just sits there, trying to hypnotize you with a rusty watch on a chain.</p>
<p>“Adie” is almost <i>too</i> insistent, which makes it an odd contrast to the other songs’ unhurried pace. By contrast, the electric guitar on “Sinking Feelings” sounds spry and limber, kicking up some dust as the harmonica dances a jig around it. Rarely has Toth ever sounded so unguardedly celebratory and carefree as he does on that song and “Home + Horizon”, and who knew it would suit him so well? On <i>Farmer’s Corner </i>he sounds like a man happy to be nowhere near the end of his long, hard journey. </p></div>"|19366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19366-wooden-wand-farmers-corner/|7.6|Stephen M.

Isolation is a frequent theme in his lyrics and music beyond the fact that he works alone. <i>Leaving</i>, from 2009, showcased the budding stages of Wasluck's sound; it was a largely unheralded effort even after Enemies List re-released it in 2010, but Wasluck forged on, releasing a series of tapes, EPs and splits in the following years. <i></i></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><a href=""http://planningforburial.bandcamp.com/album/desideratum"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Desideratum</i></a> is his second full-length and first for the Flenser; it's an improvement on his earlier work, bringing together the many different sides found on his smaller releases. Wasluck's longing and misery plays such a role in Planning for Burial's music that it often receives equal credit alongside the instrumentation; in the liner notes for the 2012 EP <i>Quietly</i>, he credited “a lovesick/broken heart” and “gloom,"" while <i>Desideratum</i>'s credits include ""whiskey"" and ""bad sleep.""</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">On “Where You Rest Your Head At Night” (which originally appeared as a demo version on the 2011 compilation EP <i>Late Twenties Blues</i>) Wasluck beats one riff into the ground over and over for eight minutes, so even when drums and piano come in, the assault hardly cedes. This circular riffing mirrors the lyrics, in which Wasluck describes one of his many restless nights: “When it's late and I can't sleep/ I circle your block/ Looking for any signs that you may still be awake.” On the demo version, the guitar is more smeared and the drums are bare thumps; here, the drums come out and punctuate the guitars, like Godflesh's heaviness seeping through Jesu's melancholy. For an eight-minute track with minimal arrangement, it has a breathtaking immediacy that makes it one of the strongest songs on the album and his catalog. This is Planning For Burial at its most metal, and this hardly resembles most metal in content, sound, or the willingness to be open.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The most devastating song on <i>Desideratum</i> is “Purple”, constructed from an ambient drone overlaying a voice program reading a text that Wasluck received from a past love interest solemnly desiring to reconnect. It's the shortest song on the record, and it succinctly captures the frustrations of love and heartbreak in the digital age. Filtered through the sterile voice program, the normally heartfelt words become severed from any real sense of emotion, little more than bits of information. Lyrical content aside, “Purple” is also an example of Wasluck's use of gorgeous, yet tortured drones, which sound like drifting away from the earth at quarter speed.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>Desideratum</i> ends on a grayly inspirational note with “Golden"", which begins with Wasluck's bare guitar and voice before feedback creeps in and the song explodes into a mass of thick stomps, pained leads, and drones. Lyrically, Wasluck's listening to records with an unknown female character while “thinking about the girls who wanted nothing to do with you”. As for his specific thoughts on that subject, he doesn't hold back: “The golden years never happened to you or anyone you thought you knew/ They all grew up to be miserable adults, just waiting for the day they get to die.” For a guy who gets hung up on past relationships, he's not terribly fond of nostalgia either.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">“Golden” could be interpreted pessimistically, but it also suggests that “golden years” are a crutch, and that once you break free of the notion's constraints, you'll be better for it. Wasluck may have a permanently fractured heart, but he bares himself to the world because other people share his feelings, too. In an area of music that's too often defined by esoteric aesthetics and insularity, <i>Desideratum</i> is a testament to openness.</p></div>"|19237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19237-planning-for-burial-desideratum/|7.9|Andy O'Connor

The majority of the duo's colleagues from the early 2000s have since called it quits, but the workmanlike Akron boys Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney kept their heads down, dutifully churning out gutshot blues-pop mimicry that carried just enough of a punch to establish them as, at the least, a reliable stadium-act opening band.</p>
<p>Then: worldwide financial turmoil struck, the buying public went from purchasing few records to no records at all, dance music infiltrated pop's consciousness, and guitars were, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNA-4tnM_xY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">prophetically</span></a>, exchanged for turntables (or, in keeping with recent trends, MPCs). Banjo-players and Dave Grohl formed an unlikely alliance to establish ""real music"" as 2010s mainstream rock culture's slyly conservative ethos and just like that, the Black Keys emerged as the most popular guys making music that sounds like older music without <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">getting all P.T. Barnum about it</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14222-brothers/""><i>Brothers</i></a> from 2010 (the first record made at Muscle Shoals in three decades, natch) was the Keys' most consciously bloated effort and, paradoxically, the one that placed them firmly in their current position of The Only Band Your Friend From High School Listens to These Days; writing their catchiest song to date, ""Tighten Up"", helped, as did soundtracking every goddamn car commercial and buddy-comedy movie trailer that didn't have <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsJiGF_Groo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">breakdancing hamsters</a> in it. Cementing their rep as canny opportunists, Carney and Auerbach returned a year later with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16098-el-camino/""><i>El Camino</i></a>, a sleazy, hook-laden album that switched between the basic thematic food groups of cars-and-women and cars-as-women with the horndog exuberance of a kid doing donuts on an ATV in an abandoned dirt lot.</p>
<p><i>El Camino</i> was the best ZZ Top album that you <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44845-the-black-keys-block-new-album-el-camino-from-streaming-services/"">can't stream on Spotify</a> and, in an impressive feat for a band so 9-to-5 about their creative process that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/767-rubber-factory/"">they once recorded an album in an actual factory</a>, it also turned out to be their most distinctive work and arguably their best. The Black Keys' eighth album and first in three years isn't their worst effort—that distinction still belongs to 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9398-magic-potion/""><i>Magic Potion</i></a>, their paste-bland major-label debut—but after the relatively fresh approach on <i>El Camino</i>, it's dismaying how much of the inert, mid-tempo <i>Turn Blue</i> resembles elements of their previous albums: <i>Brothers</i>' stoner-friendly drift, <i>Attack &amp; Release</i>'s toy-xylophone psychedelia, <i>Magic Potion</i>'s indifferent blare. After a decade-plus of pilfering musical history with all the subtlety of a brick through a windshield—for Christ's sake,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k8es2BNloE&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> last time around they basically plagiarized ""Last Dance With Mary Jane""</a>—the Black Keys' cultural cannibalism has finally turned inward.</p>
<p><i>Turn Blue</i> finds the Black Keys getting deep with themselves in several ways; Auerbach recently told <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/stream-the-black-keys-trippy-new-album-turn-blue-20140505"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> that the band set out to make a singles-bereft ""Headphone[s] record,"" and he's <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/26/black-keys-turn-blue"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">alluded elsewhere</a> that his messy, allegation-laden divorce proceedings—which, in a this-joke-writes-itself touch, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53480-black-keys-member-dan-auerbachs-bob-dylan-hair-is-not-what-you-think/"">once was believed to include a lock of Bob Dylan's hair</a>—lent the album a ""melancholy"" vibe. Appropriately, <i>Turn Blue</i> sounds distant and subdued, a murky-sounding collection of '70s stoner-rock facsimiles and swirling gray tones that, for the most part, are indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Lyrically, the Black Keys' casual chauvinism has gone from ""Girl, you look so good"" to ""Woman, you done me wrong,"" the shift in mindset undeniably affected by Auerbach's personal troubles. ""Why you always wanna love the ones who hurt you,"" he sings over the sluggish bounce of ""Year in Review"", ""Then break down when they go and deserve you."" Allusions to rain, running, sickness, and the open road are predictably expressed, and Auerbach admits on the title track's disco-ball lilt: ""In the dead of the night/ I start to lose control."" The couplet speaks volumes, as the mushy gruel of <i>Turn Blue</i> represents the sound of a band going so deep into their own heads that they lose track of where the exit doors are located.</p>
<p>It's tempting once again to blame the dullness on Brian ""Danger Mouse"" Burton, a sometimes-capable producer whose reputation in recent years has carried the weight of an ""Out of Order"" sign on a bathroom door. Indeed, Burton's reign of boredom continues here in typical fashion<span>; his love for airlock-hatch atmospherics and stiff string-section motifs are intact, and even without the credits confirming it, you could probably guess that the orchestral touches of ""Year in Review"" were lifted from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monika_%28film%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the score for an Italian 1970s sex comedy</a>.</span></p>
<p>If Burton remains an easy scapegoat, this time it's harder to make the charges stick. <i>Turn Blue</i> is the second consecutive Black Keys album where he's credited as a contributing songwriter, and as the veritable third Black Key since <i>Attack &amp; Release</i>, his presence has led to some of the band's most successful, purposefully forceful music. The Black Keys are, in fact, the one band this decade that Burton has collaborated with effectively, so the failures of <i>Turn Blue</i> come across mostly as a byproduct of an imbalance of power. While the suffocating weightlessness of the LP's first third is enough to give anyone who's listened to a Broken Bells record more than once a serious case of PTSD, Carney and Auerbach sound as if they're holding back in response, succumbing to bland choruses and muddy aimlessness despite the fact that their catalog dictates they're capable of much more than this. Throughout <i>Turn Blue</i>, it's difficult to tell how invested these guys actually are in the music they're making, an indifferent attitude that encourages the listener to act in tandem.</p>
<p>The Black Keys have never been known for innovation—we're talking about a band that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYzYO-SdGY4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered the fucking Beatles</a> on their first album—but <i>Turn Blue</i>'s strongest moments happen when they explore new territory. At nearly seven minutes, opener ""Weight of Love"" is a moody epic that carries melodic hints of the pleasantly stretched-out ""Bullet in the Brain"", meandering to a searing guitar solo that, for those with heavy investment in searing guitar solos, should more than suffice. Lead single ""Fever"", meanwhile, is <i>Turn Blue</i>'s Festival-Headliner Hit, its subtly catchy hook and farty keyboard sounds resembling what might happen if MGMT-circa-2014 tried to write something approaching ""Electric Feel"" in terms of weirded-out pop accessibility.</p>
<p><i>Turn Blue</i>'s most surprising moment arrives at the end: ""Gotta Get Away"", whose title alone suggests that the Black Keys are ready to move on from this uncharacteristically dour fog they're trapped in. Coming off as the strongest classic-rock beer-commercial jam since Kid Rock's cliché-tastic ""All Summer Long"", the cowboy-boots guitar riff and Auerbach's unchained vocal take pair perfectly to create the album's most energizing blast-in-a-glass cut, to the point where it's hard not to dream of an entire album of songs like this. The song <i>sounds</i> like summer; with the right sync, ""Gotta Get Away"" could make millionaires out of anyone who sells rubber tires and rope.</p>
<p>""For no one/ It's no fun, no fun/ With a one track mind,"" Auerbach sings on the tune, after name-checking Kalamazoo and wondering where all the ""good women"" have gone in typical dirtbag fashion; it's hard not to read his lyrical admission as anything but self-prescriptive. On a record where the Black Keys' try way too hard to be ""weird,"" ""Gotta Get Away"" is the sole moment where they get out of their own heads and back into that beat-up van. You can't fault them for trying to get deep, but this is one band for which shallowness is a virtue. </p></div>"|19329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19329-the-black-keys-turn-blue/|5.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

The set was eerily similar to the group’s performances in their mid-1990s prime, all wobbles and grumbles with an occasional flash of off-kilter transcendence. But there were elements of the performance that were jarringly different as well, namely an exhibition of cold, canned efficiency that almost utterly undermined the air of confusion and chaos that Robert Pollard and company once brought to their music. That workmanlike quality—both charismatic and chilling—has grown since GBV reformed for their lackluster 2012 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16131-lets-go-eat-the-factory/""><i>Let’s Go Eat the Factory</i></a>, and it’s carried over into their sixth comeback full-length, <i>Cool Planet</i>. The line between exhilarating and exasperating is still being straddled to the point where it's starting to chafe.</p>
<p><i>Cool Planet</i> coasts on the same mix of curdled ballads, power-pop sparklers, and tossed-off oddities as its most recent predecessors, but there’s a decided kick to the album’s handful of true gems. “Authoritarian Zoo” could be accused of setting the bar too high too early; it's a hammering anthem in which Pollard croons with slightly out-of-tune relish about animals and paranoia—the kind of mangled pileup of imagery that once informed GBV’s best pop songs, and still does. “Pan Swimmer” continues the trend of vintage Pollard made fresh, a 62-second hook-burst that explodes like a time-lapse blossom, while the sprawling-by-comparison “Males of Wormwood Mars” represents the record’s most inspired three minutes. Over an infectious drum fill and riffs that shift between gentle jangle and chunky distortion, Pollard weaves a magic-realist-meets-sci-fi narrative that could pass as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16147-the-soft-boys"">Soft Boys</a> b-side.</p>
<p>The tipping point from mosaic to mishmash happens somewhere near “Psychotic Crush”, a promising squiggle of psychedelia—complete with mocking guitar figure—that ultimately can’t pay its vast debt to Status Quo’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEV55fCkW80"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Pictures of Matchstick Men”</a>. “Table at Fool’s Tooth” is more successful in its stately yet shambolic, punk-meets-Jethro-Tull pastiche, but on “Hat of Flames”, GBV curiously flops at trying to copy GBV—namely every other song from <i>Bee Thousand</i> and <i>Alien Lanes</i>, the period of the group’s own catalog that their current incarnation has most avidly tried to revive. When stacked against inspired tracks like “Cool Planet”, whose apocalyptic power-pop veers spiritedly from triumphalism to fatalism, a backpedaling rehash—let alone half an album of them—just doesn’t cut it.</p>
<p>Ballad-wise, <i>Cool Planet</i> spectacularly disappoints. Save for two stellar, simmering delicacies sung by Tobin Sprout—“Narrated by Paul” and “Ticket to Hide”, both of which shout their gleeful Beatles references even as Sprout himself whispers, especially on the sumptuous, piano-led former cut—the album is strangled by its slower moments. Pollard barely shows up on “Cream of Lung”, a dull muddle that sounds as lively as if it were recorded while he brushed his teeth. “Bad Love Is Easy to Do” fails in its attempt to be direct and sentimental, but worse off is “Fast Crawl”, which spoons out meandering sludge in unsavory lumps. Where GBV’s slovenly, dilapidated grandeur once felt vital and radical, it now putters along crankily, the sound of a band muttering to itself rather than playing to anyone in particular, themselves included. There’s a certain charm to that, of course. It’s just not always enough.</p></div>"|19336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19336-guided-by-voices-cool-planet/|6.2|Jason Heller

<p>Rhys’ capacious curiosity is given even greater room to roam with his latest solo project—the operative word being “project,” in the studious high-school-class-presentation sense. Its roots lie in Rhys’ recent discovery that he's a descendent of John Evans, a Welsh explorer who, in the 1790s, embarked on a solo voyage through America to locate the Mandan, an obscure tribe of Welsh-speaking Indians linked to a 12th-century Welsh prince named Madoc (who, as legend has it, touched down on our continent a good 300 years before Columbus). But rather than just update his Ancestry.com page and call it a day, Rhys booked a tour along the same path his forefather traversed. This wasn’t your standard-issue solo-acoustic campaign, but a multimedia PowerPoint presentation—booked into art galleries and lecture halls—chronicling Evans’ journey, interspersed with new songs inspired by it. Given that Evans died long before the invention of the camera, and no paintings of the man exist, Super Furry Animals’ go-to artist Pete Fowler built a puppet version of his imagined likeness to serve as Rhys’ onstage second banana and travel companion. Because that’s how Gruff Rhys rolls.</p>
<p>The tour is chronicled in Rhys’ new documentary with co-director Dylan Goch, <i>American Interior</i>, which is currently making the rounds on the festival circuit. But for those not in the vicinity of a screening, there’s this namesake 13-song companion album, which provides a vivid retelling of the story even in the absence of visuals. “100 Unread Messages” essentially serves the same function as the <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>-style dot-to-dot maps that plot Evans’ trek in the film, detailing his initial arrival in Philadelphia, en route to St. Louis and up the Missouri River, and then down to his final resting place in New Orleans. But even this straight-forward travelogue is infused with Rhys’ ever-peculiar musings: As he explains in the film, the song is told from the perspective of someone who’s been trying to email John Evans repeatedly but, for obvious reasons, receives no reply, thereby transforming the biography of an historical figure into a comment on the mind-warping effects of internet addiction. And the track’s countrified Krautrock stomp—supplied by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54688-kliph-scurlock-is-no-longer-in-the-flaming-lips/"">excommunicated</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a> drummer and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55030-kliph-scurlock-says-he-was-fired-from-flaming-lips-for-standing-up-to-wayne-coynes-friends-racism/"">fellow Native-American enthusiast</a> Kliph Scurlock—is far more robust and widescreen-scaled than the modest, folk-oriented music Rhys has thus far released under his own name, positioning <i>American Interior</i> as the Rhys solo release that’s most in tune with the Super Furry Animals’ manic genre-blurring, retro-futurist mandate.</p>
<p>Really, if this had been released as the first SFA album in five years, no fan would complain, as it encompasses several of the band’s signature modes: the ace-in-the-hole ’70s soft-rock throwbacks (“The Last Conquistador”), the nursery-rhyme funk jams with impossible-to-pronounce hooks (“Allweddellau Allweddol”), the multi-sectional, pedal-steeled prog-pop opuses (“Year of the Dog” and its instrumental-coda counterpart “Tiger’s Tale”). And by fortuitous fuzzy logic, the hair-raising, string-swept cavalry charge “Iolo” works as both a nod to the Welsh poet that backed out of Evans’ expedition at the last minute, and a sonic manifestation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>’s phonetically related philosophy. But the Evans narrative provides an emotional throughline that connects and grounds this stylistically free-ranging collection—for all his apparent eccentricity, Rhys has always been an exceptional balladeer, and poignant, piano-bound turns like “Walk Into the Wilderness” feel all the more affecting in the light of the real hardship that inspired it.</p>
<p>But Rhys’ affinity for John Evans clearly goes beyond mere blood relations—for Rhys, Evans was the original Welsh punk, who pursued his vision despite the ridicule, incarceration, and isolating loneliness inherent to the mission. And like so many of the punk icons we lionize today, Evans may have been considered a failure in his lifetime (spoiler alert: his story does not end happily), but his work proved highly influential to those that followed: historians claim his hand-drawn maps of the American northwest were crucial to Lewis and Clark’s landmark maiden expedition to the left coast in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. With <i>American Interior</i>, Rhys not only follows in Evans’ footsteps but, in his own way, helps fulfill his original mission: If, years from now, social anthropologists note an unusually high concentration of Super Furry Animals fans along the Missouri, we’ll know why.</p></div>"|19323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19323-gruff-rhys-american-interior/|8.0|Stuart Berman

The confined, loner vibe of his 2009 debut </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13476-dia/"">DIA</a></i> <span style=""font-size: 15px;"">sounded like it was made in a cabin in the woods—which it was—but it also hinted at wider vistas McMahon might someday explore.

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">This also means that </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Love</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, in line with its broad title, is less unique than previous Amen Dunes efforts. There are more obvious reference points here—the solitary creep of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"">Syd Barrett</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, the slow croak of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, the bittersweet swing of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2286-david-kilgour/"">David Kilgour</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, and the patient twang of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4664-wooden-wand/"">Wooden Wand</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. But the decreased individuality actually makes the music stronger. McMahon is so open to (and adept at) simple melodies and turns of phrase that he’s bound to evoke lots of other good music along the way, as if he’s tapping into something more elemental.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Besides, as long as McMahon is singing, Amen Dunes will never sound quite like anyone else—and on </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Love, </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">he sings better and more ambitiously than ever. Each song rises and falls with the elastic stretch of his voice, which makes shapes the way a glass blower inflates raw material into art. His voice does echo some other spirit-conjuring singers, particularly the warbled croon of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"">Devendra Banhart</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. But where Banhart’s mannerisms can come off as affected, McMahon sounds like he’s trying to channel something bigger than himself—a goal at which he succeeds quite often.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That searching approach is reflected in McMahon’s wondering lyrics, which step toward a horizon that keeps receding. Though McMahon’s musings are often in the first person, he’s filled with uncertainty, fascinated and confused by the self and what he can know about it. He darts around the subject and skirts obvious meaning, recalling the way Oldham bent tangents on </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18650-bonnie-prince-billy-bonnie-prince-billy/""><span>the latest Bonnie “Prince” Billy album</span></a><span>. Even when McMahon hits on some answers, as in the bluntly-titled “I Know Myself”, he still questions and doubles back, over meditative acoustic strums that suggest his journey won’t end, and shouldn’t.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Still, when all of McMahon’s seeking comes together, the results can feel like the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Two examples stand out: the loping “Lonely Richard” marches forward with one tempo and little chord variation, yet McMahon makes it sound like he's scaling a mountain, to the point where a chorus as objectively banal as “have yourself a good time” becomes bracingly profound. That’s topped only by “Lilac in Hand”, whose stoned lilt should by all rights sound lackadaiscal, even lazy. But again McMahon sees simplicity as a chance to explore and discover (an effect captured nicely by the tune’s blurry, black &amp; white </span><a href=""http://youtu.be/hDWlFYlasNk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>video</span></a><span>). Building an expanding universe with just a few tools: it might not be a new trick, but it’s one McMahon continues to perfect with Amen Dunes.</span></p></div>"|19234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19234-amen-dunes-love/|7.8|Marc Masters

Their sound is ugly and intense; it’s not all black metal, and though some of the more warped moments sound like someone’s left a copy of Incantation's <i>Onward to Golgotha</i> outside in acid rain, it’s not entirely death metal, either. Instead, it's a weaponized hybrid of the two genres, as the majority of the band's guitar work remains an impenetrable mass, a near-constant stream of wild, squealing leads and solos come howling out from beneath the murk. Their technique illustrates just how much Teitanblood owes to thrash metal’s frantic ferocity. As has been his custom since the band’s inception in 2003 (save for their first demo, which featured current Proclamation guitarist Usurper of Eternal Condemnation and Inverted Crucifixion), NSK handles bass, guitar, and vocals. He’s had over a decade to perfect that balance, and it shows. There's a cold-blooded method to his madness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The powerful rhythm section is the weighty altar upon which Teitanblood consecrate their rituals. The drums never let up for a moment; J's movements are so focused and intense that he often seems on the verge of spontaneous combustion. NSK carries the majority of the weight, but it must be noted that J’s heavy lifting fuels the album’s beating black heart.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Death itself comes in many forms, and Teitanblood seem to enjoy illustrating a smattering of examples on <i>Death</i>. “Cadaver Synod” erupts with an atomic blast, “Silence of the Great Martyrs” bursts into crackling flames, and dread sounds of the Rapture usher in the lengthy “Sleeping Throats of the Antichrist”, which builds into a towering inferno of lawless darkness bookended by moments of eerie atmosphere. The album stretches well past seventy minutes, smoldering and suffocating in equal measure. It’s a lot to stomach, and a sure dealbreaker for the passing curious. Teitanblood is not for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-c1498d29-d894-5edf-6995-6abb576b4bae""><span>The flames sink into embers as <i>Death</i> rides out slowly. “Silence of the Great Martyrs” reverts back to heretical grace, its dark ambiance backed by chimes, foreboding synth, and a chorus of liturgical chanting. The album fades out, but the impact it makes lingers. As much as <i>Death </i>possesses noisy, “anti-musical” characteristics, there's a studied musicality concealed within the fracas. NSK may scorn studio shine or melodic pandering, but he knows how to write a song. What’s more, he knows how to do so in a manner that leaves listeners dazed and wondering what they’ve just witnessed. Therein lies the genius of <i>Death</i>: it’s a complete homage to extremity and regression, yet it pushes boundaries that lesser bands never thought to look for. Teitanblood grimly bring order to chaos, and with <i>Death</i>, have surpassed themselves once more. </span></span></p></div>"|19232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19232-teitanblood-death/|7.4|Kim Kelly

But they are the rare band of their vintage who seem less concerned with living up to or building upon a past legacy than establishing a completely different one. In retrospect, the 14 years that elapsed between 1996’s <i>Soundtracks for the Blind</i> and 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14651-my-father-will-guide-me-up-a-rope-to-the-sky/""><i>My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky</i></a> were less a break-up-induced hiatus than a gestation period. The bigger, brawnier Swans that Michael Gira has assembled in its wake (complete with a strapping, bare-chested gong-smasher named <a href=""http://assets.noisey.com/content-images/contentimage/20530/thor.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thor</a>) are beholden neither to the primordial, industrialized sludge of the band’s infamous ’80s catalogue nor the post-goth serenity of their ’90s work. Instead, they’ve perfected a new means of transforming grostequerie into grandeur and vice versa.</p>
<p>With 2012’s astonishingly colossal <i>The Seer</i>, Swans pulled off the unlikeliest of coups: A record that, over its six sides and two-hour-plus running time, was seemingly designed to test the commitment of the band’s most ardent followers yet, amazingly, expanded their audience to an unprecedented degree. (This summer, Swans are even playing <a href=""http://nxne.com/2014/nxne-2014-swans/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the odd free festival date</a> in outdoor public squares, which could conceivably earn them a few new fans in the grandparents-and-strollers demographic.) But while Swans have always been the last band to pander to audience expectations, Gira nonetheless seems aware that anticipation for a new Swans album has arguably never been greater. And so he’s responded in the best way possible: by producing a record that, in structure and scale, is every bit <i>The Seer</i>’s equal, yet possessed by a peculiar energy and spirit that proves all the more alluring in its dark majesty.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two albums can essentially be gauged by their respective album covers. Though there’s a similarity in composition, <i>To Be Kind</i>’s artwork trades<a href=""http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/18141/homepage_large.07924400.jpg"" target=""_blank""> <i>The Seer’</i>s dark shadows</a> for a bright mustard tone, and the central feral-dog figure for cute baby faces (as rendered in a series of six by L.A. painter Bob Biggs), suggesting a more approachable ethos at play. But as any new parent can tell you, an infant is as volatile and destructive a creature as the wildest of field animals and, likewise, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Congleton"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Congleton</a>-produced <i>To Be Kind </i>boasts a more focused attack—with a preminum on taut, throbbing grooves and blackened blues—that initially tricks you into thinking it's more accessible than its predecessor. (Hey, there's even a song named in honour of Kirsten Dunst.) Yet it’s ultimately accessible in the same way a prison gate is accessible—getting in is relatively easy; getting out unscathed is an entirely different story. Upon hearing the introductory Cajun-funk strut of “A Little God in My Hands”, I initially worried that Swans were crossing over into the sort of campy, Southern-fried creepiness you’d hear on the soundtrack to an episode of ""True Blood"". But after that destabilizing blast of brass and synapse-frying synth beam appears out of nowhere at the 90 second mark, “A Little God in My Hands” carries on as if infected by a virus; it tries to keep its cool, but the once-sprightly rhythmic bounce is now ridden with a nervous tension, while the encroaching chorus of dead-eyed female voices transform the song into a mutant-zombie version of its former self. On <i>To Be Kind</i>, this is what constitutes a lead single.</p>
<p>Close observers of Swans will notice that seven of the 10 songs here were previewed in some form on last year’s limited-edition concert album/demos collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18712-swans-not-herenot-now/""><i>Not Here/Not Now</i></a> (whose sales funded the new album’s production). But most have since been subjected to dramatic embellishment or rearrangement. <i>Not Here/Not Now</i>’s tense, acoustic-strummed closing sketch “Screen Shot” has been recast as <i>To Be Kind</i>’s louche, slow-boiling “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gJFzPt1i-U&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yoo Doo Right</a>”-styled opener and, in the process, illuminates the great contradiction at the core of the 21st-century Swans sound: as their sonic vocabulary has grown more elaborate and texturally detailed, Gira’s sense of melody has turned all the more minimalist and mantric. Thirty years ago on the deadpan dirge, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTaC9Y582MQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Job</a>”, Gira sang from the perspective of the world’s most bored axe murderer (“Cut off the arms/ Cut off the legs/ Cut off the head/ Get rid of the body”) as a metaphor for soul-destroying, day-to-day workplace drudgery; on “Screen Shot,” he more eagerly sings of a different sort of dismemberment  (“No touch/ No loss/ No hands/ No sin”), of purging urges—and the body parts used to indulge them—as way to achieve a state of spiritual purity.</p>
<p>The ensuing songs on <i>To Be Kind</i> present variations on this theme—of unleashing an outsized sound to find an inner peace, and reclaiming one's innocence by way of insolence. But, of course, this being a Swans record, salvation never comes easy. When, amid the “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxYXV2RrwIs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dirt</a>”-covered funereal march of “I’m Just a Little Boy” Gira pleads, “<i>I need loooooooooooove</i>,” he’s answered by a Greek chorus of devious, derisive laughter. (Of all the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Y3fUk7-JM&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">terrible</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXtHMBFWmI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">humiliating experiences</a> detailed in Swans songs over the years, that moment just might count as the cruelest.) And if the 34-minute centerpiece “Bring the Sun”/“Toussaint L’Ouverture” initially summons our planet’s primary life-source with all the trance-inducing elation and desperation of a remote-island pagan sect praying to their gods for a bountiful harvest, its more sinister second act—wherein Gira maniacally howls the name of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the titular 18th-century Haitian revolutionary</a> while drowning in a swamp of dub spewage—transforms the track into an after-hours seance gone wrong.</p>
<p>As it plays out, <i>To Be Kind</i> starts to resemble a cult procession unto itself, a mesmerizing spectacle of an omnipotent band whose sound continues to expand in scope and ranks swell in size. Much like <i>The Seer</i>, <i>To Be Kind</i> sees a formidable and evermore prominent coterie of female vocalists—from the insurgent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30393-cold-specks/"">Cold Specks</a> to reigning freak-scene queen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a> to avant-rock veteran <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4882-little-annie/"">Little Annie</a>—falling under Swans’ sway. And rather than provide a calming counterpoint to Gira’s stentorian croon, their voices ultimately serve the album’s hypnotic force. From the teeth-gnashing ferocity of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16866-oxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Oxygen</a>” to the calamitous, battering-rammed climax of “She Loves Us!”, <i>To Be Kind</i> adheres to a policy of transcendence by any means necessary, even if it means repeatedly bashing you in the face with a mallet until you’re seeing stars and colors.</p>
<p>On the hymn-like title-track closer, Gira solemnly repeats the words “to be kind” as both an aspirational self-help slogan and a tacit acknowledgement that, given all the diabolically orchestrated malevolence we’ve been subjected to over the preceding 112 minutes, he hasn’t always done the best job of heeding his own advice. But as the song violently erupts into one final, sustained surge of tectonic-plate-shifting discord, the moment proves to be as affirming as it is unsettling. “People always consider us to be very dour and depressing, but fuck that shit,” Gira <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8925-swans/"" target=""_blank"">told Pitchfork’s Brandon Stosuy in 2012</a>. “The goal is ecstasy.” And what makes <i>To Be Kind</i> so compelling is how that goal seems both fully realized yet forever out of reach at the same time. </p></div>"|19326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19326-swans-to-be-kind/|9.2|Stuart Berman

Speaking to <i><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/little-dragon-fertilizing-for-new-album-20131017"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stone</a></i> late last year, the Swedish-Japanese vocalist explained that, for this record, the Gothenburg-based band started with nothing—no ideas, no vision, no plan. “We dove into different worlds,” she said. “New spaces we haven't been to before.” Some of that uncharted territory turned out to be more familiar than suggested: the <a href=""http://klappklapp.nabumarubberband.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interactive website</a> that factored in the album's unveiling was set in Nagano’s pleasantly kitschy home studio, and during the recording process she wandered around the band’s longtime hometown of Gothenberg in winter while listening to Janet Jackson.</p>
<p>This wintry mix of fresh and familiar suffuses <i>Nabuma Rubberband</i>, which opens as if Nagano stepped inside from one of these walks with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLjtdiNLK10&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Twenty Foreplay”</a> stuck in her head and started writing before her fingers uncramped from the cold. The intermittent thuds throughout “Mirror” depart noticeably from the magnetic rhythms of 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15672-ritual-union/""><i>Ritual Union</i></a>, hinting at the album's changing focus. Though their very first release, 2006’s <i>Twice</i>, showcased Nagano’s voice with spacious, somber piano chords, <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/little-dragon-return-with-new-album-nabuma-rubberband-20140214%20%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she said</a> in another interview that Little Dragon felt self-conscious about writing “slow jams”. It took them another three years to arrive at the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>-indebted funky freakouts of 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13701-machine-dreams/""><i>Machine Dreams</i></a>, as well as the beat-focused collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/%20"">SBTRKT</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/%20"">Gorillaz</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6770-dave-sitek/"">Dave Sitek</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28936-maximum-balloon/"">Maximum Balloon</a> project that followed.</p>
<p>Little Dragon's continued to explore the dichotomy between dance music and downtempo since, and when Nagano doesn’t stick too closely to one or the other on <i>Nabuma Rubberband</i>, the results are more adventurous than on the catchy but slightly underwhelming <i>Ritual Union</i>. There's a Japanese game show-styled interlude (“Lurad”), string accents by the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra (“Nabuma Rubberbands”, “Pink Cloud”), and “Killing Me”, which coats <i>Machine Dreams</i>’ synthesizer freestyles in grimy noise. It’s nice to know Little Dragon can still pull off the same rhythmic variations and textural contrasts that made their earlier output such a rewarding listen, even if it doesn’t always go smoothly: just when they settle into a groove on the ominous, glittering “Only One”, the song whiplashes to a close with an industrial beat that sounds tacked on.</p>
<p><i>Nabuma Rubberband</i>'s slow jams are perfectly sexy, but they lack originality. Even after repeated listens, the album's velvety sequence of “Pretty Girls”, “Underbart”, and “Cat Rider” fail to leave a lasting impression. Nagano’s beguilingly smoky voice has also lost a little bit of its allure, and when Little Dragon foray into already well-trod territory—there’s even a song called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16852-paris/"">“Paris”</a>, complete with breathy French lyrics—they invariably disappoint. It’s great the band was able to find a throughline between the comfortable and the experimental this time around, but on <i>Nabuma Rubberband</i> they let go of a little too much of themselves in the process.</p></div>"|19327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19327-little-dragon-nabuma-rubberband/|6.8|Harley Brown

Her downy voice is equally appealing whether set in growly rock music or glitteringly ornate folk, the poles that her new album <i>Changing Light</i> often switches between. But more than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"">Beat Happening</a>, she recalls a certain Pacific Northwest band that she came up alongside. Specifically, Mirah's lyric writing resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists/"">the Decemberists</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists/"">Colin Meloy</a> if he sang from his diaphragm instead of his nose, and likewise she's too poised for the chancy idioms of punk and twee. Instead, she makes her albums into their own magical islands where nothing too chaotic gets in—or out.  </p>
<p>It's been five years since Mirah's last LP, the gentle and enveloping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12809-aspera/""><i>(a)spera</i></a>, where the music evoked seashell fragments glinting in a shallow tide. <i>Changing Light</i> reflects a marked sonic shift from polish to grit. ""I will go to the desert,"" Mirah sings on opening track ""Goat Shepherd"", and the arid invocation lingers even through the verdant ballads. In theme and sound, this is a relatively stripped down music of desperation and exile. Gouged with desert rock tropes, the album inverts <i>(a)spera</i>’s blue-hued fluidity, built instead on a rugged bedrock of shadowy black and scorched orange timbres. Distorted electric guitars snarl and bite, drums slap and rattle in your chest, basses plunge like canyons. Even as the brass on ""No Direction Home"" glowers like Mahler, a rattlesnake shaker sneaks the desert in. Mirah unfolds a characteristically lovely but slow-stepping vocal melody, a mannered pace that makes her songs sound more alike than they are until you spend considerable time with them.</p>
<p>Mingled with these tougher, grainier sounds, <i>Changing Light</i> has plenty of torchy art music based on gossamer acoustic strains, such as the folky ""Fleet Foot Ghost"". There are shades of '80s pop ballads on ""Turned the Heat Off"", the first Mirah song to even remotely bring <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOGEyBeoBGM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Belinda Carlisle</a> to mind, and slinky album highlight ""Oxen Hope"", where a light slick of vocoder seems to unfasten some restraint in the singer, who turns in an unusually limber performance. But the synth-tom rolls buried deep in the mix, like someone falling down a staircase inside herself, remind us that a quiet catastrophe is underway.</p>
<p>Uprooting herself after a breakup, Mirah wrote these songs while living an itinerant existence over the last few years. Still, she picked up collaborators as she ran—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"">Deerhoof</a> drummer Greg Saunier, a well-matched <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4241-mary-timony/"">Mary Timony</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29772-mount-moriah/"">Mount Moriah</a>'s Heather McEntire, and Emily Wells. The music is topped with generally flattering arrangements by Seattle composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30504-jherek-bischoff/"">Jherek Bischoff</a>, whose strings slice so high and thin they're like cuts you barely feel until the blood starts flowing.</p>
<p>Mirah's sister Emily Zeitlyn co-wrote ""LC"", an aptly dusky and prayerful homage, complete with second-person confessional tone, to the breakup survival kit that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a>'s music provides. But the topic has begun to wear a bit thin, because as Mirah sings on ""No Direction Home"", ""This is a sorrow everyone knows."" You can only hear about other people's breakups for so long before sympathy turns into a desire to talk about something else, especially when the resulting pain is described in such wrought, high, distancing language.</p>
<p>Mirah's slightly clinical approach to songwriting makes this ostensibly personal album revealing only in comparison to her often guarded prior ones. For all its emotional charge, <i>Changing Light</i> barely feels more intimate than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10511-share-this-place-stories-and-observations/""><i>Share This Place</i></a>, her multimedia concept album inspired by a French entomologist—in fact, she writes <i>more</i> comfortably and warmly about the insect kingdom than the human one. Here, she continues to seem a little beyond our reach, hidden behind the hedgerows of manicured arrangements and an imperturbable singing style. Even in the wide-open conceptual deserts with collaborators in tow, Mirah's music is somehow still an island: enticing, but always receding as we approach. </p></div>"|19265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19265-mirah-changing-light/|6.0|Brian Howe

This is mostly a fancy way of saying he’s a songwriter, but Savage has a memorable way of describing the sights of an otherwise common life. A sun is not a sun, but ""a five billion year old fire""; a broken relationship is not a broken relationship, but an ""empire of hate."" It’s only been a year since his last album,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18153-sean-nicholas-savage-other-life/""> <i>Other Life</i></a>, and Savage is still singing about the same themes of loneliness and love. But he’s breathed life into his homespun arrangements and learned to dive deeper into himself to recover rarer conclusions, justifying his prolificness. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There’s a soft rock bent to Savage's sound: the drums are unconfrontational, the guitars soft and Spanish-inflected. Savage’s voice is worn out yet piercing, as though a thousand miles couldn’t keep him from getting through. He puts his whole self into the swelling refrain on ""Heartless"", pleading the title of ""Please Set Me Free"" while singing from inside what sounds like a rainstorm. The interplay between the fullness of the arrangements and Savage’s often despairing presence provides a viewpoint as to where his imagination takes him on those lonely nights. When he sings ""You come naturally to me"" to a lover on the lighter-than-air ""Naturally"", he might as well be talking about his own ability to execute his ideas.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Similar to fellow Canadian and former labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/"">Majical Cloudz</a>, there’s a directness to Savage's approach that threatens to become uncomfortable. The ability to reconcile immense expressions of sadness and guilt with awareness is rare—he dives into himself without getting lost—and the songs on <i>Bermuda Waterfall </i>are beautiful and yearning. At the same time, his musical style occasionally toes the line between ""cool lounge"" and ""chintzy infomercial,"" and as Savage continues to interpret small moments as small failures, it's hard not to tire of the constant introspection. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's important to keep in mind, then, that Savage's viewpoint is a byproduct of isolation, where one analyzes every experience in search of deeper subtext while avoiding the risk of sounding like a loon when you explain it to someone else. But rather than loitering in solitude, Savage is reaching out his hand: <i>Bermuda Waterfall</i> was written for his friends, whom he memorializes on ""Hangin On"" for being so thoughtful as to wonder when he might be coming to a party. That<i>'s </i>the type of inconsequential, commonplace interaction that sometimes means the world to an individual, and Savage’s ability to locate an oasis of connection in a desert of heartbreak is what makes <i>Bermuda Waterfall</i> endearing rather than irritating. </p></div>"|19266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19266-sean-nicholas-savage-blue-waterfall/|7.0|Jeremy Gordon

The obscure enclave led by Jan Anderzén specializes in pieces carefully assembled from samples and snippets of improvisations. Woven into these tapestries are rough-hewn scraps of melody that blur the distinction between acoustic and electronic sound; it’s often impossible to differentiate a synth lead from a shrill reed instrument, or a grainy field recording from an overblown drum machine. When it becomes futile to attempt to catalog the source material, Kemialliset’s songs come across as uninterrupted streams of raw, constantly unfolding texture—as willfully dizzying and deceptive in their syntax as a film montage.</p>
<p>More so than on any previous release, <i>Alas Rattoisaa Virtaa</i>, the group’s latest full-length, finds them working primarily with identifiably electronic sounds. The sonic palette and approach are reminiscent of collagists such as Ground Zero and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a>, where free-floating noise objects coalesce into loose, slushy grooves and fall out of them just as quickly. Here, Anderzén and company sometimes indulge in full-on synth-scapes without their usual balance of hand-drum loops, harmonized Scandinavian bagpipes, or guitar blasts. “Roiske Ruudukolla”, a pointillistic exercise for MIDI orchestral instruments, Jean-Michel Jarre arpeggiators, and wordless vocals phased out into digital gravel, is particularly surprising. The aesthetic is not far off the avant-Muzak pastiches of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"" target=""_blank"">James Ferraro</a>. When put up against the recorder and balalaika trimmings of earlier KY albums (see 2002’s <i>Kellari Juniversumi</i>), the contrast is staggering.</p>
<p>Kemialliset’s approach to layering incongruous and damaged sound artifacts is uncompromising, but the music is never outright abrasive. Even the chunkiest sine waves are pacified by a bit of reverb or ambience. The clever sequencing also contributes to the record's relative smoothness, or at least helps blunt some rough edges. Anderzén expertly masks cuts and fades, creating form out of chaos like a young, circuit-bending Teo Macero. “Vettä Yarahille”, in particular, is remarkably sutured, morphing from skeletal, handclap-driven R&amp;B into a denouement of birdsong and voices speaking in tongues (think the “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iocqFm7pQss&amp;noredirect=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cloven Theater”</a> of the Sun City Girls).</p>
<p>Despite these diplomatic gestures toward establishing unity and balance, <i>Alas Rattoisaa Virtaa</i> is never a passive listen. If we dare to nod our head to a muted Terry Riley-like melodic loop, some far-off siren or blockade of detuned synths always disturbs the idyll. Dialectic and disruption aren't ornamental techniques for Kemialliset—they're the central organizational principles of the group's music, keeping the project from becoming too scattered and less deserving of our undivided attention.</p></div>"|19351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19351-kemialliset-ystavat-alas-rattoisaa-virtaa/|7.6|Winston Cook-Wilson

The results strayed from rap towards gently rambling spoken-word territory, but miraculously, the duo didn't lose their audience: 2008's resonant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11471-when-life-gives-you-lemons-you-paint-that-shit-gold/""><i>When Life Gives You Lemons You Paint That Shit Gold</i></a> sold the most of any Atmosphere release and marked an unlikely new chapter in an already-unlikely career. </p>
<p><i>Southsiders</i> extends the ""quietly durable"" phase of the Minneapolis duo's lifespan. The 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15297-the-family-sign/""><i>The Family Sign</i></a>, which featured the upraised fist of Daley's newborn second child on its cover, told stories that were close to his home while not being strictly about him—there were upsetting and finely detailed narratives of spousal abuse and breakups, but few first-person pronouns. <i>Southsiders</i> dials in closer: opening track ""Camera Thief"" finds him in his kitchen with his children. ""I still kick it with angels, the only difference is/ Instead of the bar, I'm at my kitchen table,"" he raps. The line obliquely references ""Angelface"", a track from 2005's landmark <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/344-you-cant-imagine-how-much-fun-were-having/"">You</a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/344-you-cant-imagine-how-much-fun-were-having/""> <i>Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having</i></a> that detailed tour conquests with self-loathing and relish. It establishes the creative challenge of <i>Southsiders</i>. Daley has two children, a kitchen table, and a domestic existence of sorts, and he's trying to figure out how to make an Atmosphere record about that.</p>
<p>The awkward, uninspired construction of that line hints at the creeping problem: Contentment is damnably hard to write about. For most of us, contentment is a gift, a welcome reason to rev down the whirring of our mental engines. We analyze our bad feelings because we're trying to figure out how to banish them, but we simply enjoy our good feelings. Daley is smart and self-aware enough to diagnose this problem on ""Camera Thief"": ""I don't need my defensiveness/ I keep to myself, my family and friendships/ I got enough people I could disappoint/ If you disagree, I think you missed the point,"" he raps, defensively. But pointing to the problem doesn't dissolve it, and when he follows up with """"Now pull up a chair/ Let me tell you about the last few years,"" it's hard to muster a lot of excitement.</p>
<p>More distressingly, a spare tire of flab has developed around Slug's usually chisel-sharp writing.  ""Gotta be a model civilian/ And get your name printed on a bottle full of pills, and/ Spill your guts into a Dixie cup/ Give no fucks, kiss no butts,"" from ""The World Might Not Live Through the Night"", is a stretch that would never have made it onto an earlier Atmosphere record. ""If everybody on the comet agreed/ We could set the clock to whenever we wanted it to be"" is a nice sentiment, but not a terribly incisive thought, and when he throws it out on the gently bumping ""Fortunate,"" it's hard not to flinch a little bit.  </p>
<p>But even working at half-capacity, Daley hits some powerful nerve clusters. On ""Arthur's Song,"" there are freeze-in-place images to savor like ""Train tracks underneath the faceless moon"" and some of his trademark writerly details: ""Been a few years since the last cigarette, but if you put your finger inside the flask, it's still wet."" ""Time flew/ Like it's designed to do"", from ""Star-Shaped Heart,"" has a lovely, jewel-like simplicity.  </p>
<p>There are a few moments where Slug revisits earlier versions of himself. On the curiously titled single ""Kanye West"", he revisits some well-trod codependency-addiction territory (""She said she want somebody she could take care of/ And right then is when we paired up""), and on the title track he throws out goofy battle raps (""Show me a player who's mad at this/ And I'll show you a hater and a masochist"") like it's still 2005. The pinched fury of that era is long gone from Slug's voice, and the song feels downright affectionate, like a high-school picture, a fond look back at his ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbn7nBZk-Xg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Whoever put out album must've needed write-offs</a>"" era.   They foreground the album's lack of focus: For the first time in Atmosphere's long career, the stakes feel low, and <i>Southsiders</i> feels both pleasant and noncommittal, like it isn't even convinced of its own right to exist.  </p></div>"|19320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19320-atmosphere-southsiders/|6.3|Jayson Greene

His vocals are chopped up and slurred, juxtaposing screw's lean-fueled stupor with the frantic, slippery agility of footwork: ""Robitussin, pink surrrp/ Robitussin, pink surrrp/ Promethazine promethazine (we on one)"". The utterances hold a strange weight now, especially following the speculation that <span>the juke and footwork icon might have died of a drug overdose</span> following misleading police reports (the drug paraphernalia those reports extraneously mentioned was said to be </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/01/dj-rashad-died-blood-clot-not-drugs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>marijuana-related</span></a><span>); regardless, the attempts to gain closure and clear the air over Rashad's death have cast a pall over the concurrent release of this new EP. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In an alternate universe, <i>We On 1</i> provides four tracks' worth of proof that Rashad's 2013 breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18627-dj-rashad-double-cup/""><i>Double Cup</i></a> was just the beginning of his next leap forward, rather than <span>an inadvertent eulogy or an object of what-could-have-been speculation</span>. As it stands, it's a concentrated jolt of wide-ranging takes on an already down-for-whatever sound, with Rashad finding countless vantage points to throw odd asides and funny mutations into the 160-BPM barrage of digital percussion. The beats are expectedly heavy-hitting and distinct even at their densest, rumbling with crisp, open-space fidelity that finds nuance in subwoofer-stressing bass and generations-old 808 claps. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""We On 1"" is a trunk-rattler that groans under its own weight and lets its beats push through the drone, sawn-off versions of booming-system throbs impenetrable as solid steel but buckling and waving like gelatin. When that heavy growl is peppered with Rashad's characteristic stagger-rhythm snares, the bass rumble starts shaping more distinctly into a bass</span><span>line</span><span>, as one-note and insistent as the style demands but unified into something even bigger than its already hulking frame. Rashad pulled off a smart trick by taking this frenetic blueprint and using its supercharged tempo to swing between trebly, claustrophobic AK-47 percussion and the wide-open, two-ton glide of that low-end assault. (Get a load of the ""Aja"" drop, too.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Two other tracks feature Rashad's longtime friend and frequent co-producer DJ Spinn. The beat of the '80s ghettohouse nod ""Come on Girl"" metamorphizes from insistently one-two bass jabs to fast-clacking snare rolls to flat-out drum'n'bass breaks to breath-snatching fusions of all three. It's so relentless that even the looped shout of ""pop that pussy!"" nearly gets lost in the flood. The woozy sing-song-laced ""Do It Again"" (also featuring Teklife member and ""Way I Feel""/""Drums Please"" collaborator DJ Manny) initially comes across as light, a gently blissed-out female vocal providing the gradually-forming repetition of the titular hook, washed in lawn-sprinkler hi-hats and boosted by warm, weighty bass hits. But its smooth build into breakneck snare-bass buildups and breakdowns, laced with Southern-tinged molly-rap signifiers and ""Fuck me"" whispers, turns the track into a bristling juxtaposition of anticipatory calm and fevered motion.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Considering that Rashad's sound finds the intersection of emotional swells, nostalgic happiness, and shivering catharsis, EP closer ""Somethin 'Bout the Things U Do"" (featuring veteran ghetto house/juke innovator Gant-Man) is <i>We On 1</i>'s inarguable standout. A footwork reassembly of Chaka Khan's instantly recognizable ""I Feel for You"", those iconic David Frank synthesizer hits and Stevie Wonder harmonica riffs are tweaked into a frantic fast-forward caricature that subsequently stretches, loops, and hammers home every last truncated syllable out of Khan's voice into a monomaniacal burst of joyous abandon that ricochets off the retrofitted footwork rhythms.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We may not be finished talking about DJ Rashad's legacy yet. Hopefully, there'll be far more to come, both from his own vaults and from the Teklife collective. As long as there are artists out there who are willing and able to take his lead, to find a way to make ribcage-collapsing bass and deep soul work in tandem, to work all the angles of every kick and rattle to make that 160 BPM upend any efforts to straitjacket it, Rashad will be with us.</span></p></div>"|19330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19330-dj-rashad-we-on-1-ep/|7.8|Nate Patrin

Undeterred, he yells ""Youth culture forever!"" as he runs away to try something new. You might consider this when listening to <i>Youth Culture Forever</i>, the sophomore album from Scottish trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30616-paws"">PAWS</a> that comes here to both praise and bury youth. Like contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"">Yuck</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31657-tony-molina/"">Tony Molina</a>, you can pinpoint PAWS’ 90s alt rock influences from a mile away—there’s a bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">Mascis</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2655-stephen-malkmus/"">Malkmus</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5558-rivers-cuomo"">Cuomo</a>, and the like. But while they spend time recounting the well-worn experiences of being young—the drunkenness, the heartbreak, the drunken heartbreak—they also push aside foolish things in favor of sober observations, giving them gravitas beyond their years. </p>
<p class=""p1"">""Erreur Humaine"" is a loud-quiet-loud meditation on what feels like the futility of humanity when dealing with a collapsed relationship; when Philip Taylor sings ""Just 22 and I feel like I'm through,"" he’s a world away from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"">Taylor Swift</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFeZr5ptV8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ebullient take on that age milemark</a>. Taylor might remind you of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"">Titus Andronicus</a>’ Patrick Stickles, another guitar hero who’s made a career out of turning feelings of self-loathing into anthems. What ails Taylor are situations that can’t be grappled with until they emerge: dead friends, imploded confidence, hometowns that don’t evoke any fond feelings when you find yourself walking through the streets. A song on 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17172-cokefloat/""><i>Cokefloat!</i></a>, ""Catherine 1956"", paid tribute to a deceased parent; <i>Youth Culture Forever</i>'s ""Alone"" and ""YCF"" are performed as stripped-down dirges at imaginary funerals for friends and states of mind. As Taylor proclaims, ""I’ll have my youth culture forever,"" you know he knows he won’t. </p>
<p class=""p1"">PAWS have also beefed up their sound since <i>Cokefloat!</i>, which was regarded as a lo-fi record; on <i>Youth Culture Forever</i>, the rhythm section rumbles outward and the guitars are thick and present. ""Great Bear"" sounds like the animal namechecked in its title, while ""War Cry"" shakes and sears like an active volcano for nearly 12 minutes, spewing monolithic guitar lines and layers of feedback. The record is largely composed of uptempo singalongs filled with wistful feelings and perfectly timed ""whoa oh"" harmonies that they’ve picked up from pop-punk. Another element from that genre PAWS have picked up is that it’s more fun to sound happy about how sad you are, as Taylor chants lines like ""Sometimes we were forced to accept defeat"" as communal bummers. </p>
<p class=""p3""><i>Youth Culture Forever</i>’s uptempo songs also factor as some of its weakest moments. ""Narcissist"" castigates someone who can’t stop talking about how hard his life is, and since it's possible that Taylor could be making himself a target here, it's essentially three uninteresting minutes of a singer checking his own privilege. Then there’s ""Someone New"", which wins points for honesty but overcommits with its thrashing whine.  If <i>Youth Culture Forever</i> runs the risk of alienating listeners who aren’t particularly interested in what young people have to say about anything, though, it’s a mark of the album’s endearing success that PAWS don’t seem to care.</p></div>"|19354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19354-paws-youth-culture-forever/|7.2|Jeremy Gordon

It began in what looks like somebody’s basement, with a cheery co-host and a laugh track with quote marks around it, but has since become a live event with an actual audience replacing the “studio audience”. As funny and bizarre as it can be, <i><a href=""http://youtu.be/X6aNIesES1I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Mike Adams Show</a></i> might be little more than a straight parody of late-night television were it not for Adams’ affable chuckle and genuine interest in the lives of his guests, all locals (Pitchfork contributing writer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/staff/eric-harvey/"">Eric Harvey</a> made an appearance in an early episode).</p>
<p>Adams is a goofball in the best sense, a guy who leads with his sense of humor, and that extends to the music he makes as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32218-mike-adams-at-his-honest-weight/"">Mike Adams at His Honest Weight</a>. When he plays with his band, he cavorts across the stage, holding the mic close to his chest and waving a finger in the air to emphasize certain lyrical passages. Recently, he and his band played a live show dressed as priests, complete with clerical collars and crucifix medallions. Part crooner and part pop star, Adams projects an outsize persona from the stage, which he then punctures with his between-song banter. Somehow he manages to come across as both ironic and deeply sincere, goofing on the conventions of pop music (he made <a href=""http://vimeo.com/93099769"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this video</a>, after all) even as he embraces them as a means of communicating some deep pain.</p>
<p>His songs aren’t dark, but they are heavy. “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16831-im-worried/"">I’m Worried</a>”, the first single from Adams’ second album, <i>Best of Boiler Room Classics,</i> was written about the concerns he faced while his newborn son underwent multiple open-heart surgeries. Thankfully neither dour nor blandly life affirming, the song evokes those endless moments of abject worry, with a long, tense instrumental interlude conveying the hand-wringing boredom of a waiting room. Presumably, music assuaged Adams’ fatherly fears: He sneaks in a quote from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>’s “Just Like Heaven,” as though singing an old favorite to himself: “Show me show me show me how you do that trick/ That keeps you calm.” If the theme is harrowing, the tone is anything but: the music is jangly and lush, with pinpricks of guitar jabbing against his vocals that somehow keeps the melody bobbing and buoyant.</p>
<p>Adams’ sense of humor shows through in the exaggerated hooks that pepper <i>Boiler Room Classics</i>. Songs like “Be Free, Live Well” rush excitedly into towering, tumbling choruses, while slower numbers like the brooding “A Woman Is the New Man” and “Don’t Want It, Don’t Get It” follow clean melodic lines, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/619-burt-bacharach/"">Bacharach</a> at his most ruminative. On closer “Good Thing Going,” he sounds uncannily like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a>; on “The Fingers You Know,” like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">Byrds</a>. He and his band work with a musical palette that is both broad and specific, blurring the distinctions between <i>Nuggets-</i>era rockers, Midwestern power pop, late-night lounge, and ‘80s synth-pop.</p>
<p>Adams is not necessarily concerned with integrating these various styles into something wholly new. Rather, he’s projecting an identity through musical cues, speaking through the shared language of pop. If his touchstones were too obscure or inside-jokey—if they weren’t so much fun—it might sound like he’s only playing to his record collection. Instead, <i>Boiler Room Classics</i> is shot through with deep nostalgia and an even deeper melancholy, as though Adams’ true subject is the fleeting nature of happiness, the impermanence of family and friends. Or, as he sings on one of the album’s sunniest hooks: “We’ve got a good thing going/ So we better get going, before the good thing goes.”</p></div>"|19350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19350-mike-adams-at-his-honest-weight-best-of-boiler-room-classics/|7.8|Stephen M.

Brightly colored, hyper, and upbeat, the Virginia native's music draws openly from genres that street rap usually has no time for: bachata, go-go, classic house. When Diddy's Revolt.TV <a href=""http://revolt.tv/news/artist-spotlight-goldlink-explores-future-bounce-on-the-god-complex/177D845E-CEC5-4003-A347-462A2576024D"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">asked him to describe his style</a>, he responded thoughtfully: ""Rick James meets Justin Timberlake (*NSYNC days) with Backstreet Boys and a little D12 and Tupac."" GoldLink is a unique creature in rap right now and he knows it. </p>
<p>He doesn't have much music to his name yet<i>—The God Complex</i>, his debut mixtape, is only 26 minutes and nine tracks long. Prior to that, there were six songs on his Soundcloud. But his sound is distinct and unusual enough to have snagged the attention of local tastemakers: Peter Parker, nighttime DJ at D.C. urban radio station WPGC, <a href=""http://wpgc.cbslocal.com/2013/12/31/the-top-15-dmv-artists-to-watch-for-in-2014/http:/wpgc.cbslocal.com/2013/12/31/the-top-15-dmv-artists-to-watch-for-in-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">named him</a> one of the DMV's artists to watch last year, and several of those early songs of his have surpassed 100k plays on Soundcloud. He's struck a nerve, even if no one knows exactly where that nerve is just yet. </p>
<p>There is a lot of information to parse on <i>The God Complex, </i>all of it happening at once. The BPMs are nearly twice as fast as current street rap allows, and glitzy house synths flutter everywhere. Louie Lastic, one of GoldLink's main collaborators and an architect of the sound that they've dubbed ""Future Bounce"", handles most of the production here; the resulting sound is wet and lubricious—there is a lot of audible licking and jiggling, both in the lyrics and the music.  The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nj1HWC-dQs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ronnie Foster sample</a> behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6195-a-tribe-called-quest"">A Tribe Called Quest</a>'s ""Electric Relaxation"" peeks out furtively behind strobe lights and '90s R&amp;B keyboards on ""Bedtime Story"". A slowed-down playback of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"">Britney Spears</a>' ""Toxic"" surfaces near the end of ""How It's Done"". You can imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"">Azealia Banks</a> wishing she'd corralled production from this crew. </p>
<p>And yet, GoldLink tramples through the music, his rhymes as hard as a shoulder check. This is one of the most fascinating pieces of GoldLink's sound—he skips through the minefield separating rap's ideas of ""hard"" and ""soft"". On ""Bedtime Story"", he calls out wearers of tight jeans and waves box-cutters at us. On ""Hip-Hop (Interlude)"" he reminisces about ""masturbating to them porno flicks my brother gave me"" and ""popping guns"" at age 11. His voice is high, hyper, and excitable, no one's idea of a tough-guy stereotype, but he keeps one foot firmly planted in street rap and the other in the club, tangling all the music's reference points and intentions like kite strings. The surfaces of his music are slick and slippery, and gaining purchase on what he's doing is like trying to hug a dolphin.</p>
<p>This confusion, and the endorphins it loosens, is presumably why people have been losing their shit about GoldLink. His music doesn't just make you hold two opposing ideas in your mind--it opens twelve tabs in one browser window.  On ""Planet Paradise"", he raps in triple-time, allowing a single pinhole gulp of air to open between ""everyday we pray to-"" and ""God"" in the exact same place every time. His mind moves at a thousand miles an hour, as does the music. Nine tracks is more than enough to digest for now. </p></div>"|19325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19325-goldlink-the-god-complex/|7.9|Jayson Greene

She begins the song in a weary murmur, announcing that, after five years away, she's ready to step back into the spotlight and endure all the ""embarrassing"" comparisons she will receive to other female pop stars. Then, in the chorus, she all but invites these comparisons by name-checking some artists she seems to perceive as her contemporaries: ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Riri</a> isn't scared of Katy Perry's Roaring/ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Queen B</a>'s gone back to the drawing/ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a> smells blood, yeah she's about to slay you/ Kid ain't one to fuck with when she's only on her debut.""</p>
<p>""Sheezus"" is a maddeningly catchy, deeply puzzling song. Is she paying homage to these women? Is she making fun of them? Maybe a little bit of both? (And while we're asking the unanswerable: Why is she dressed like a Na'vi from <i>Avatar</i> in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54895-lily-allen-shares-new-video-for-sheezus/"">the song's video</a>?) Maybe Allen wants ""Sheezus"" to be read as a critique of the ruthlessly combative, Who-Wore-It-Better? pageant that our culture creates for female celebrities—though at the same time, she admits that part of her desires that rigged game's flashy prize. ""Give me the crown, bitch,"" she snaps a little too convincingly at the end of the chorus, ""I wanna be Sheezus.""</p>
<p>All things considered, the Lorde reference is particularly loaded. Nearly a decade ago, Allen was the promising and precociously literate pop insurgent who was ""only on her debut."" That record was 2006's enduringly charming <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9221-alright-still/"">Alright, Still</a>—</i>a personable blast of witty, hip-hop-informed pop that featured lively character sketches of famous family members, eccentric London townies, and shitty ex-boyfriends. It sold millions and made her a star, particularly in her home country. Allen became a fixture on the London club scene and an acid-tongued presence in the British media; she took a brief and well-publicized break from drinking after telling Elton John to ""fuck off"" on national TV.</p>
<p>Her second record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12662-its-not-me-its-you/""><i>It's Not Me, It's You</i></a>, was as shimmery and sharp as a shattered mirror, critiquing the vapidity of fame (""The Fear"") and the ways in which the deck is stacked against outspoken women who dare to outlive their ingénue phase (""22"", a song about the Rock-Forever-21-But-Just-Turned-30 set, now feels like a bleak sequel to Taylor Swift's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFeZr5ptV8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hit of the same name</a>). Though the tabloids charted Allen's every affair, her most passionate love/hate relationship seemed to be with her own notoriety. (A telling detail that almost every profile of her dutifully noted: After she was arrested in 2007 for attacking a photographer, she blew up a copy of the police citation and hung it in her foyer.)</p>
<p>Clearly, Allen possesses a terrific flair for irony. But there's a fine line between using irony to make a cutting point and using it as a protective coating to hide the fact that you're not sure exactly what you're trying to say. Allen was once a master of the former, but <i>Sheezus </i>too often finds her drifting perilously in the latter territory. Even before she was disowning her underperforming singles as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54315-lily-allen-admits-her-new-singles-are-rubbish/"">""docile pop rubbish""</a> on Twitter a few weeks ago, we got a taste of this back-pedaling and double-speak on the album’s lead-off single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52130-video-lily-allen-returns-with-hard-out-here/"">""Hard Out Here""</a>, which fashioned itself a critique of music industry sexism but, to some listeners, sent an unfortunate mixed message. ""I don't have to shake my ass for you, cuz I've got a brain,"" Allen sang, as though the two were mutually exclusive; behind her, a group of black women shook their asses at the camera. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52993-lily-allen-responds-to-criticism-of-hard-out-here-dancers/"">When the video was accused of being racist</a>, Allen clarified, ""If I could dance like the ladies can, it would have been my arse on your screens."" All of this confusion only muddled her original point, and made you wonder if the song had as much brain power as Allen advertised.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Allen was one of the first high-profile artists to cultivate a fanbase via the internet; she posted demos on Myspace in advance of <i>Alright, Still</i>, and later became known for writing confessional posts on her blog. But the controversy that ""Hard Out Here"" generated seemed like a barometer of how much the internet has changed in a few short years—especially when it comes to talking (or making music) about feminism. As the writer Michelle Goldberg described in <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/178140/feminisms-toxic-twitter-wars"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">a recent cover story for <i>The Nation</i></span></a>, it can sometimes feel on Twitter like there is a radical SWAT team that would rather jump on anyone who Does Feminism Wrong (see also: the ""Is Beyoncé A Feminist?"" Thinkpiece Fatigue of 2014) than allow people to express ""well intentioned"" but ""imperfect"" opinions. Because she<i> is</i> making some valid points about double standards in the music industry, some might find it tempting to consider Allen a victim of this kind of hand-wringing. But in the end, <i>Sheezus</i> fails on much less ambiguous grounds.</p>
<p>There's nothing particularly wrong with the way the album sounds: It's a sleek and bubbly, if somewhat indistinct, pop record. It's not easy to write songs that are as catchy as they are verbose, but Allen and her frequent collaborator, producer Greg Kurstin, have not lost the light, agile touch they showcased on the best of <i>It's Not Me</i>. ""L8 CMMR"" is cheeky summertime pop, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5030-sugababes/"">Sugababes</a>-sweet ""Air Balloon"" is infectious enough that I can <i>almost</i> forgive Allen, lyrically, for making the same joke as that stupid <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1k3f6g_kurt-cobain-john-lennon-elvis-presley-marilyn-monroe-2pac-and-more-selling-dutch-beer_fun"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bavaria Radler commercial with Elvis and Kurt Cobain</a>. (Almost.) The record's most satisfyingly on-point moment, though, is ""URL Badman"", a satirical send-up of spiteful internet commenters. Allen sings it in the voice of a parents'-basement-dwelling ""London white boy repping ATL"" who says things like, ""I don't troll, <i>I make statements</i>."" Even though he spends his days spouting Wordpress vitriol at famous women who will never fuck him, he wants us to know that deep down he's really just a sensitive guy, ""like Drake.""</p>
<p>If only this record could put its money where its delightfully dirty mouth is. But too often, there's a tone of scolding, mean-spirited superiority about <i>Sheezus </i>that, after a few spins, makes you wonder why Allen thinks she’s so different from that blogosphere hater. The feather-light R&amp;B number ""Insincerely Yours"" is bogged down by cheap shots and Twitter-beef petulance: ""I don't give a fuck about the Delevingne, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Ora"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that Rita girl</a>, about Jourdan Dunn… I don't give a fuck about your Instagram, about your lovely house or your ugly kids."" Allen's venomous tongue was previously effective when it spewed at unidentified love interests or impersonal cultural institutions like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWjNFC-FinU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""society""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F-lqOrRcIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Sun</i> and <i>The Mirror</i></a>, but, as on “Sheezus”, she runs into trouble as soon as she starts naming names. Not only will “Insincerely Yours” age about as well as the Fred Durst diss in ""The Real Slim Shady"", but less forgivably, it contradicts the record’s overall message. How can Allen not see that she's playing into the very catfight narrative that, four songs previous, she was supposedly trying to end?</p>
<p>Even as Allen takes both serious and “ironic” jabs at her contemporaries, she seems plenty interested in borrowing from their sounds and sensibilities. “Our Time” is her obligatory stab at a YOLO-anthem, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“We Can’t Stop”</a> in everything but name and cutting-edge production. There’s also a particularly noxious song called ""Silver Spoon"", the main argument of which scans as, “Fuck off, I grew up <i>slightly</i> less rich than you think I did.” Although it aims for empathy across class lines, it just comes off as defensive. Furthermore, although Allen’s records have always been stylistic hodgepodges, <i>Sheezus</i> doesn’t flow as fluidly as her last two. When things get a little weary after the mandatory ballad about not wanting to be famous anymore, cue ""As Long As I Got You"", which is...a zydeco song?</p>
<p>“The game is changing,” Allen sings on “Sheezus”. “Can’t just come back, jump on the mic and do the same thing.” There is something poignant and disarmingly honest about this song—very few artists pull back the curtain on the kind of fears and anxieties she’s acknowledging here. And while Allen’s right—the game <i>is</i> changing—there are plenty of reasons to feel more hopeful about the future than she does. Katy Perry’s “Roar” wasn’t a catty snipe at anybody’s Instagram, but instead a primal battle cry of female self-empowerment. Yes, Beyoncé did go back to the drawing board—and she returned to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/"">completely reinvent the album as a relevant format in 2014</a> and prove that brains and ass-shaking can coexist <i>and the world shall continue to turn</i>. And in the short amount of time she’s been on the scene, Lorde has not only spoken out against the music industry’s sexism but also cultivated a powerful sense of solidarity with other young female pop stars. Even in the context of a joke, the word “diva” feels applicable to her least of all. She is not the girl who wants to “slay” her “rivals”, but <a href=""http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2014026/rs_560x415-140126085915-1024.Taylor-Swift-Lorde-Pre-Grammy-Party.jl.012614.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">befriend</a> and <a href=""http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/139129/BFFs-Taylor-Swift-and-Lorde-Gush-Over-Each-Other-On-Twitter-After-Grammys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">root for</a> them instead.</p>
<p>So “Sheezus” is based on a false conceit. Nobody’s vying for the title of Top Diva in 2014 because—and this is the great and exciting thing about women in pop music right now—there’s enough room at the table for all different kinds of femininities, sexualities, races, body types, and sounds. (It ain’t perfect, of course, but progress is being made.) <i>Sheezus</i> has a few good points and some admirable intentions, but too often it misses the point. In the end, Allen only fans the flames she says she wants to extinguish.</p></div>"|19322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19322-lily-allen-sheezus/|5.4|Lindsay Zoladz

On each track, mangled samples are fused into colorful masses that convulse for a couple minutes and then humbly fade away. The album belongs to a strand of meta-music that takes the surplus of recorded media as both backdrop and subject. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/425-the-books/"">The Books</a>, working from physical sources, staked out this collagist approach near the beginning of the previous decade, and their name is insolubly linked to the concept of forging obscure narratives from audiovisual errata, drawing as much attention to the medium as the message.  </p>
<p><i>TANHÂ</i> updates the Books' approach for contemporary times; its disturbances are contextualized by stuttering streams and nested browser windows instead of crackling vinyl and faltering radio waves. The pitch-bent vocal fragments are grounded, however distantly, in hip-hop rather than folk. If the Books evoked waking up to the sound of a possessed radio, <i>TANHÂ</i> is like falling asleep while multiple Pandora stations play at once on a lagging connection, dreamlike narratives emerging from the clash of clipping signals.</p>
<p>Digital sampling is a much less arcane art these days, so <i>TANHÂ'</i>s connoisseurial approach to junky abundance feels familiar. One song is called ""⌘v"", a keystroke instantly familiar to any Mac user, indicative of how commonplace and codified cut-and-paste music has become. But even if music like this no longer packs the potential to blow minds, the record remains compelling for its striking sense of design, concentrated doses of emotion, and a sweet melodic sense that softens the aggressively choppy rhythms—the latter of which can also sound refreshingly delicate at times, like pebbles rolling through a reverberant cave. Rap, fusty standards, spoken dialogue, and zany sound effects roil through deconstructed beats and cottony melodies, streaked with traces of Japanese folk, classical and ambient music. The bright, gulping electronics recall fellow Japanese artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9845-odori/"">Radicalfashion</a>, while twinkling piano themes evoke the contemplative moods of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13980-polaroid-piano/"">Akira Kosemura</a>.</p>
<p>Lee has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9368-lee/"">claimed a J Dilla influence</a>, but that soulful lope is nowhere in evidence. Hip-hop shows up in prismatic fragments—an MC's disembodied ""Hey""s punching through the cinematic trip-hop of ""aśrava"", or samples from Fat Joe's ""Firewater"" twisted into paperclip shapes to fasten together the high-contrast cuts of ""sen"". The boldest tracks have either a more cartoonish or sentimental feel. The former is epitomized by ""sankha^ra^"", where the percussion evokes gremlins busily dismantling a plane in a wartime Bugs Bunny cartoon, and ""muditā"", where dreamy pianos and synths mix with braying Woody Woodpecker-like laughter to forge a beguiling blend of sweetness and madness. The sentimental aspect comes to the fore in “dukkha”, which revolves around Nat King Cole's ""For Sentimental Reasons"", and ""三"", built around the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" chestnut ""3 is a Magic Number"".</p>
<p>""dukkha"" lands with a schmaltzy jolt of familiarity, but its producers really do seem to be in a sentimental mood, giving the song a respectful and emotional treatment of gently jammed-up lounge piano. These tracks' short lengths don't allow for room to develop, which makes them seem more based on tenets of design than music—like something you’d hear at an art installation. So the aforementioned two songs are key, lending the record a more intimately human nature.</p>
<p>There's a thin stretch near the end of <i>TANHÂ</i> where several tracks linger without standing out, but the album rallies for a strong finish with the songful ""mantra"" and the closing title track, where the producers smooth out the aggressive disturbance they've cultivated to impress us with what they can do from a compositional standpoint rather than a technical one. While this kind of music may no longer sound like the future, it makes for an arresting view of the present in idiosyncratic hands such as these.</p></div>"|19270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19270-lee-ar-2-tanha/|7.4|Brian Howe

His re-works of disco and forgotten R&amp;B album cuts (see the <i>Damita Jo</i>-era Janet Jackson remix “RnB Drunkie”, which became enough of a hit to demand several re-pressings) gained him enough traction to found his own label, MERC. Sparkling tracks like his slow-burning workout of Womack &amp; Womack’s “<a href=""%22http://youtu.be/sSkOSBoCqkQ%22"">Baby I’m Scared of You</a>”, and a fabulous, freewheeling Labelle re-edit he called ""<a href=""http://youtu.be/XGdzNwFoB9Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sunshadow</a>” were eventually compiled on <i>Mark E Works 2005 -2009 Selected Tracks &amp; Edits. </i></p>
<p>Evetts’ attitude towards edits has always been fairly utilitarian, so it’s no surprise that his interests have slowly shifted to original composition. <i>Stone Breaker</i>, his 2011 debut for Spectral Sound, was a satisfying sampler of woozy house; its monumental centerpiece, “Got to Get Me There”, proved as blissfully meandering as the best of his early work. <i>Product of Industry </i>is initially a less inviting record—though it incorporates some of the same tightly-wound, slowly morphing loops found in his re-works, it has its share of methodical, energy-sapping tracks. Taken as a larger statement, it paints Evetts as an artist who’s grown increasingly insular over the course of his career. </p>
<p>Evetts is a native of Wolverhampton and has lived in the larger English industrial center of Birmingham since 1995. <i>Product of Industry </i>could properly be called a “concept album,” but that concept is fairly nebulous, really more of a shifting mood bolstered by a set of musical connotations. Tracks like “Persia” and the perplexingly heavy-footed “Eganix” plod along with the dull robotic energy of machinery operators, their thick, leaden drums sounding like clanging pipes, or feet treading on sawdust.</p>
<p>The album tries to convey the dark side of industrialization: boredom, hopelessness, depression, and pollution all find a musical corollary at some point. Evetts often tweaks and re-tweaks interlocking parts until a given track stretches well past the seven minute mark; the album is over an hour long, but in the midst of that monotony, there are moments of specific intimacy.<i> </i>“Smoke”, with its impossibly deep voice growling ""Yea…uh huh,” seems to mimic the minute, enveloping distraction of a cigarette, eventually adding a hint anxiety before finally petering out. Back to reality, then. </p>
<p>“Bog Dance”, one of the most aggressive cuts, is also among the most entrancing, as a series of chain-link synthesizer lines whirr upwards to towering heights. It highlights Evetts' feel for structure with interlocking parts that escalate in urgency even as they continually return to the same ground, following the same tension-and-release patterns he once sutured into otherwise affable disco tracks. But despite Evetts’ abundance of ideas, there are stretches that feel like dead air. “Being Hiding”, featuring a vocal by Bing Ji Ling of the Phenomenal Handclap Band, comes off as a too-literal singer/songwriter take on the album’s underlying ideas, <span>overburdened</span> with lines like “Every day there’s a 9 to 5/ Yet we still don’t know just when it ends.”</p>
<p>Evetts is an old hand at house music’s relentless 4/4 beat, ambient washes, and slightly dissonant chords. When these details spool out at a methodical rate, they create a unique feeling somewhere between melancholy and slightly buzzed euphoria, the best example being the remarkable nine-minute closing track, “Leaving Osaka”. You could interpret <i>Product of Industry</i>’s sometimes severe tone <span>an expression of the real world's slow encroachment onto the dance floor</span>, but “Leaving Osaka” makes it sound like a further displacement of reality, as if enduring the tedium opens the door to some weird new bliss.</p></div>"|19321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19321-mark-e-product-of-industry/|7.0|Abby Garnett

The gist of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/613-nat-baldwin/"">Nat Baldwin</a>’s music is more interesting than his membership in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a>, the selling point his name has most often generated for much of the last decade. But by himself, or with any number of high-caliber collaborators, Baldwin is a singer/songwriter who employs his upright bass in much the same way as most people stuck to that tag use a piano, a guitar, or even a cello—to form the musical foundation for tense, impressionistic tunes. His fluttering, agile voice, capable of falsetto crests and valley-deep dives, only adds to the intrigue.</p>
<p>As distinct as Baldwin’s approach seems, though, his music has typically fit into predictable indie songwriter circles. The movement of his voice, for instance, recalls that of lead Projector Dave Longstreth, particularly given how Baldwin condenses and stretches syllables during wild rhythmic runs. His light timbre suggests both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/356-andrew-bird/"">Andrew Bird</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a>. In the past, however, he’s been able to veer left of such stylistic kin through impressive atmosphere (the enormous natural reverb that bathed 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11489-most-valuable-player/""><i>Most Valuable Player</i></a>) or unexpected stylistic changes (the Elliott Carter-conducts-free jazz paroxysm that punctuated 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15481-people-changes/""><i>People Changes</i></a>).</p>
<p>But on his latest, <i>In the Hollows</i>, Baldwin falls far into a quagmire of the expected, not only with vocals that take no new chances but also with a cast of collaborators that, however accomplished, scans like a cliché. Otto Hauser, for instance, is a brilliant percussionist, but his <a href=""http://www.ottohauser.com/discography.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">résumé of appearances</a>—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4520-vetiver/"">Vetiver</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"">Devendra Banhart</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"">Vashti Bunyan</a>—suggests that Baldwin is trying to pigeonhole himself stylistically. And then there’s the three-piece <a href=""http://www.nadiasirota.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">string section</a>, lifted from <a href=""http://ymusicensemble.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York ensemble yMusic</a>, whose members have <a href=""http://ymusicensemble.com/clarice-jensen/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">worked with</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"">Grizzly Bear</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a>. Their contributions to <i>In the Hollows</i> <i>sound</i> wonderful, captured in warm, high definition in a proper Rhode Island studio. But this quintet ultimately feels flat and safe, rendering a picture that’s very pretty but remarkably similar to a pleasant watercolor you’d find hanging above the bed in a mid-prized hotel.  </p>
<p>If you were to read the liner notes for <i>In the Hollows</i> without actually listening to the record, you might assume that the music is fraught with worry, a document of extreme existential awareness given poignant shape. (Baldwin, after all, wrote the bulk of <i>In the Hollows</i> while training for his first marathon, a period that often pits the trainee against his or her own human frailty.) “Light a match to erase a lifetime leading here,” Baldwin offers during “Knockout”, a song that pits eternal perseverance against the fact that few things last very long at all. And on paper, “Cosmos Pose” is a sharp, short examination of the torture we endure to approach some arbitrary idea of perfection: “Sweat it out to make the weight/ Needles stuck in every vein.”</p>
<p>But on tape, “Knockout” is practically buoyant, the grimace of the bowed bass and slapped drums lifting into a kind of hollow comfort. Cloying strings extend beneath Baldwin’s vocal, pulling tight like a safety net—which he clearly needs, since he sings the word “fucked” with the hesitation of a teenager cursing in front of parents for the first time. “Cosmos Pose” aims for high drama, with Hauser’s percussion responding to the foreboding call of the bass. Still, Baldwin seems to shrink from the weight of his own words, his voice tempered and tame even as the words he sings reveal crisis after crisis.</p>
<p>Time and again, the arrangements and performances here seem to treat their subject matter like familial black sheep, shuddering at the anxieties they propose. “Half My Life” is borne of a nightmare and mid-life despair, but it’s as affable as a Disney score. “The End of the Night”, one of two solo numbers here, sets itself up as the record’s soul-baring centerpiece. But even as Baldwin sings “I don’t know if it’s weakness or strength/ Just know that I need something to go for,” his diction is overly precise and polished, as though he were reading through a written script at a wedding’s dress rehearsal.</p>
<p><i>In the Hollows</i> never feels lived-in, or more generously, part of the reality Baldwin has found and written into these songs. The exception comes with the title cut, the record’s biggest production and the most anomalous and audacious pop anthem of Baldwin’s career. Its words are, again, loaded with feelings—namely, the sense that all the enthusiasms and experiences we collect are simply sideshows during our own march to oblivion—as Baldwin lets his voice break only to pull it together, the strings tracking beneath him like a nervous heartbeat. “Even strides mark my path for the first and last time,” Baldwin sings, his tone a wonderful mess. In this moment of honest, human admission, he flashes above the quotidian company that this record keeps. It’s a riveting flash of inspiration—too brief to renew the album, yes, but good enough to reiterate that the upright bass-playing torch singer remains more than a mere sideman.</p></div>"|19324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19324-nat-baldwin-in-the-hollows/|5.7|Grayson Haver Currin

There are no half-measures, no stylistic arcs, no organic steps taken, no time at all to let it sink in and decide if this is something you might like. They’re a duo from Grantham in England, a place most famous for being the birthplace of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Singer Jason Williamson speed-talks bile while Andrew Fearn provides coarse backing tracks, which barely get beyond cheap plastic keyboard presets. They’ve already <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/2994744-Sleaford-Mods"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">released</a> a ton of music, most of which got nowhere, until last year’s <i>Austerity Dogs</i>, which gained rolling acclaim as a treatise on the State of Things in contemporary England. It might sound unlikely, but a man who frequently references toilet habits in songs has become one of the most sharp and funny chroniclers of his country's widespread slump into disillusionment.</p>
<p>Williamson has had a few attempts at getting somewhere in music before. “I used to be in bands, fuckin’ hated it” is the slogan on Sleaford Mods’ <a href=""http://sleafordmods.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> page. They’re a band of inherent contradiction, neither coming from the English town of Sleaford nor being mods, although Williamson’s appearance bears traces of a mod past. Instead, <i>Divide and Exit</i> is about as punk as punk gets in 2014. Williamson sounds charged, wired, determined to make one last go of things, simultaneously expressing his frustration at the helplessness of it all and finding his words taking him somewhere beyond his current predicament—a juxtaposition that could have fascinating implications for this band’s future. Sleaford Mods are playing sell-out shows in the UK, gaining blanket acclaim everywhere. Their next album, post audience expansion, should be interesting, especially as Williamson drops enough music industry references into his songs to suggest he’s got an astute grasp on how its machinations work.</p>
<p>Sleaford Mods songs follow a simple formula, repeated 14 times on <i>Divide and Exit</i>. Fearn triggers his economical music, allowing it to repeat until close, while Williamson gets lost in a blizzard of words, sometimes to the point of tripping over himself (on “Smithy”, about fashion designer Paul Smith, on this album). Profanity, jokes, and commentary come thick and fast, with Williamson often sounding like he’s in an argument with himself, or addressing someone whose identity forms around his words as the song progresses. There are cultural references that will mean nothing to many people outside the UK, most prominently on “Tiswas”, named after a kids’ TV show (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiswas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tiswas""</a>) that ran from the mid 1970s to the early 80s. It barely matters because what makes Sleaford Mods work is a universal expression of exasperation, of finding yourself in a position where your ideals are trampled on so hard every day that it feels like society barely has a place for you.</p>
<p>Even the jokes and puns Williamson scatters through his songs form a particular function if you can dig past them as surface level chatter. They’re so poor, so lacking in laughs, that they resemble the kind of forced-grin jollity people put on when they’re at an absolute low, scrambling around for something, anything, to get them through the day. He hops from that kind of thinking to scathing critique in a heartbeat, calling out people who talk in fake regional accents on “Livable Shit” and then lambasting pointless nationalist loyalty in the same song (“St. George’s flag twat,” he growls). You can almost feel Williamson’s skin prickling in the places he goes to in these songs, some of which are outlined in unrelentingly grim terms. On “A Little Ditty” he rants about “gnarly coke-death faces, death death death, nine to a cubicle.” Of course, after such disturbingly lucid thinking, the song ends with a voice saying: “That was shit that end bit, mate.”</p>
<p>Some of the acts regularly mentioned in the same breath as Sleaford Mods include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3959-the-streets/"">the Streets</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall</a>, and English punk-poet <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper_Clarke"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Cooper Clarke</a>. There are traces of those artists here, but only dim ones in the overall picture. Instead, Sleaford Mods are tapping into a feeling the UK has traditionally found a more expressive home for in mediums other than music. Williamson has <a href=""http://en.bitremenn.no/sleaford-mods/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">declared</a> an admiration for the kitchen sink drama of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sillitoe"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alan Sillitoe</a>’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_and_Sunday_Morning"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</i></a>, and his ceaseless depiction of a life marred by petty violence, discontent, and resentment resembles the work of filmmaker <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Clarke"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alan Clarke</a>, whose <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079871/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Scum</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084287/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Made in Britain</a></i> are chilling depictions of societal outcasts whose lives are caught in utter stasis. There’s a similar conviction to those works here—it’s difficult to imagine anyone else being able to pull off a line like “the state is no longer your voice” on “Under The Plastic And N.C.T.”, so convincing is the tenor in Williamson’s voice.</p>
<p>The crude nature of this music as a mode of overall expression, whether it’s in the unrelenting use of swearing or in Fearn’s cloddish rhythms, might be the most powerful tool this band has at its disposal, particularly in terms of making a connection to a bigger audience. Turner Prize winning artist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Deller"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Deller</a> recently exhibited pictures drawn by prisoners of the Iraq war, which depict the chief architects of the conflict, including Tony Blair and former UN weapons inspector Dr. David Kelly. The works are raw and technically poor, but the bitterness and hatred they express is overwhelming, illustrating how base feeling, when expressed with such belief, can overcome any window dressing put up around it. Where Sleaford Mods take their wonderfully foul-mouthed antagonism from here is anyone’s guess, but it scarcely matters when they’re so vividly depicting the now. Williamson’s been through a lot, and he knows the zeitgeist when he sees it. A recent <a href=""https://twitter.com/sleafordmods/status/462555852894117888"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweet</a> from Sleaford Mods succinctly sums up both the position they find themselves in and the feeling they reflect in their music: “This is our time.”</p></div>"|19328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19328-sleaford-mods-divide-and-exit/|7.8|Nick Neyland

These arrangements made Will Wiesenfeld, then loosely associated with Los Angeles’ Low End Theory scene, stand out in a company of seemingly likeminded beat-heads. Since then, his output has become deceptively simple, retaining the signature characteristics of his earlier work, and Baths' latest EP, <i>Ocean Death</i>, hits you in the head with enormous, blunt impact.</p>
<p>Following Will Wiesenfeld’s most recent record, last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18065-baths-obsidian/""><i>Obsidian</i></a>, the EP showcases the singer’s continued focus on mortality and heartbreak. He approaches each subject with the misdirection of an experienced comedian: death is discussed with morbid joy, and heartbreak is met with anger instead of sadness or self-pity. Wiesenfeld’s songwriting remains evocative as ever, and while <i>Ocean Death</i> lacks the thematic cohesion of its predecessor, it’s another beguiling offering from a singer and beatmaker who continues to evolve into a singular artist.</p>
<p>At points,<i> Ocean Death</i> takes cues from dance music, evoking '90s dub techno while slowing things down and revealing a darkly humorous streak. The title track at once resembles <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjsWTB_3GH4&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vincent Floyd</a> and early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>; it's a whirring, humming paean to death that sounds eerily ceremonial. A baroque atmosphere lingers throughout the EP, even as Wiesenfeld's subject and sound shifts track-by-track. Wiesenfeld's an admirer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a>, artists whose surface approachability offers passageway into complicated songs; on <i>Ocean Death</i>, he’s working in a similar way, adding static prickles to represent a growing contempt for a lover on “Yawn” and burnishing the otherwise dour “Voyeur” with what sounds like harp strings.</p>
<p><i>Obsidian</i> was informed by Wiesenfeld’s battle with a deadly strain of E. coli, and its lyrics were both gruesome and vulnerable in a way that bred a unique intimacy. For the majority of <i>Ocean Death</i>, he's moved away from the pain and venom that he expressed so vehemently last time. Compare <i>Obsidian</i>'s “Earth Death” to the EP’s title track: where “Earth Death” described the fear of a person trapped in his own dying body, “Ocean Death” is gleeful, as Wiesenfeld takes on the role of the ocean, asking for someone to be sacrificed to him. It's a fitting image on a release where Wiesenfeld widens his scope.</p>
<p>There are still hints of Wiesenfeld's scorched-earth songwriting. The cruelest couplet here, on “Yawn”, masterfully combines the mundane and the vicious: “Your steady breath when you’re reading/ I think about our love and its lack of meaning.” Wiesenfeld’s sharp sense of humor pokes through elsewhere, especially in the coy attitude on “Fade White,” which finds him coaxing a companion to join him in the embrace of nonexistence.</p>
<p><i>Ocean Death</i> scan as less personal than Wiesenfeld’s earlier work, but the more generalized approach suits the music's expanse. He no longer seems obsessed with his own death: the perspective here suggests a broader apocalypse, and in that sense, the EP represents something larger than anything Wiesenfeld's done previously. Dark and painful at points, <i>Ocean Death </i>is still filled with wonder at the largeness of the world and the awesome power of endings.</p></div>"|19317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19317-baths-ocean-death-ep/|7.8|Jonah Bromwich

Her clearly realized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17312-desert-strike-ep/""><i>Desert Strike</i></a> EP, which was based around the experience of playing a videogame based around Operation Desert Storm—an event she lived through as a child growing up in Kuwait—and <i>Asiatisch</i> arrives with a new cloud of conceptual thought hovering over it. Now based in Brooklyn, Al Qadiri uses her debut full-length as a lens to refract the skewed manner in which Asian motifs have sunk into Western pop culture. She <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9348-fatima-al-qadiri/"">calls</a> it a “virtual road trip through ‘imagined China,’” a country she has never visited, but has extensively experienced through a barrage of appropriated thoughts, images, and sounds. It’s set to a musical backing so bare it feels like someone scooped out most of the contents and dumped them out, providing an intriguing counterpoint to the dense flood of thought the record carries on its back.</p>
<p>The ideas surrounding <i>Desert Strike</i> were inspired by the rapid bastardization of other cultural experiences by the West, dealing with a particular form of accelerated baton-handing that effectively transforms horror into fun in rapid time. <i>Asiatisch</i>—its title taken from the German word for Asian—broadcasts from a similar space, only with a stronger sense of remove at work. In a sense, it’s a forebear for how the West will dilute something like the first Gulf War 40 or 50 years from now, slowly contorting it and shaping it until it becomes something few who were actually there will have experienced. If <i>Desert Strike</i> was about feeling an immediate sense of personal remove, <i>Asiatisch</i> observes the long-term effects of societal remove, where great blocks of culture are siphoned off then progressively diluted until they have as much significance as an empty Coke can.</p>
<p>The tiny sub-genre of sinogrime—essentially the sound of London producers briefly looking East for inspiration circa 2002-3—has been vaunted as an influence on this record, although Al Qadiri <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/19759/1/fatima-al-qadiris-chinese-fantasy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admits</a> she wasn’t familiar with the style until after this album was finished. Still, there are ties, although most sinogrime efforts were denser in structure than these songs. Sometimes there’s little more than a crisp trap snare and a bass welt or two; often there are glassy, MIDI-indebted synth lines padding away. “Jade Stars” sounds like a sci-fi <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"">Vangelis</a> fantasy ripped straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/""><i>Blade Runner</i></a>, while “Wudang” features music so hollow it perfectly reflects the sunken feeling of binging on low culture for too long. Journalist Dan Hancox <a href=""http://dan-hancox.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/to-my-east-side-crew-get-paper-more.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">described</a> sinogrime as a sub-genre “that barely ever existed”, which is fitting because Al Qadiri also makes music that barely exists, to the point where the gaps between notes almost become the songs themselves.</p>
<p>The best tracks further dilute culture in themselves, acting like real-time examples of the disintegration Al Qadiri is interested in. “Shanzhai” is titled after the word used to describe pirated goods produced by Chinese companies, which she turns into a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3135-sinead-oconnor/"">Sinead O’Connor</a>’s version of “Nothing Compares 2 U” (itself a cover), using a vocal she describes as a “nonsense version” of the song sent to her by friends. It’s only a political record in a faint sense, making few overt statements outside of “Dragon Tattoo”, which observes Disney's racist co-opting of Asian culture by borrowing lines from “We Are Siamese” from <i>Lady and the Tramp</i>. Certainly it’s not always so easy to trace Al Qadiri’s intentions, and the largely dynamic-free range she operates in can grate at times. But the immaculate emptiness is, in a sense, <i>Asiatisch</i>’s masterstroke, helping bolster the pervading sense of dislocation of being exposed to a society that’s been fed through the photocopier one too many times.</p></div>"|19318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19318-fatima-al-qadiri-asiatisch/|7.2|Nick Neyland

Though a reaction to what they considered to be a conformist, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/222-down-is-up-14-makthaverskan-the-courtneys-frau/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><span>“happy and cute” indie scene in Gothenburg</span></a>, <i>II</i> is an interior and personal record of constricted scope, occurring entirely within Maja Milner: in her blood, in her head, in her body, in her room. Beyond that, who knows what else is going on in the world—but that’s the whole point of <i>II</i>, a record of unhinged beauty that can be wrested from longing and anger. At times it feels threatening enough to render all other concerns inconsequential.</p>
<p>The cramped confines of<i> II</i> are indicative of its attitude, a desire to get the fuck away from <i>somewhere</i>, whether it’s a torturous relationship, a mental straightjacket, or a shitty mood. For the most part, Makthaverskan flit through decades of genre variations (dream-pop, melodic post-punk, and so on) that are typically lumped into “bedsit music”. However, its punk ethos and intensity make it all feel like a crying fit so physically severe that you’re actually sore afterwards.</p>
<p>Makthaverskan try to soar with makeshift wings on <i>II</i>, and more often than not, the results are charming rather than awkward. Glistening guitar leads occasionally stumble upon a bum note, drums get lost in swirl of reverb if they let up the intensity. Regardless, it’s rare to hear a singer who can flat-out project like Milner<b>—</b>the leaps of faith she takes before hitting the skyscraping notes that punctuate the daring introductory duo of “Antabus” and “Asleep” are captivating to the point where sometimes it seems like she’s only utilizing a small fraction of her powers. But as with the rest of her band, Milner is less compelling on songs that require a bit more finesse<b>; </b>when “Drömland” drops the 100,000,000th “Be My Baby” drum intro and “Something More” runs through facile midtempo, mid-career <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>, it comes off as strangely sheepish. Consequently, there are points where Milner’s voices gets a bit too piercing amidst the unbalanced mix<b>—</b>it’s the effect of cleaning your ear with a Q-Tip and going in a little <i>too</i> far.</p>
<p>But then again, <i>II</i> takes on the form of what happens to people who’ve gone a little too far putting themselves out there—the “never again” visceral reaction one has after getting screwed by their vulnerability. (It's worth noting that “Antabus” is named after a drug which elicits a violent reaction in alcoholics when they relapse.) While little of <i>II</i>’s vitriol is lost in translation, there is no English equivalent for the band name: “The woman with the power” is as close as we can get.</p>
<p>And yet, Milner’s lyrics can be categorized into three stages of trying to recapture that power rather than owning it: ""Don’t go"", ""Please come back"", and ""Fuck you, leave"". At times, the latter is literally what it comes down to<b>: </b>there’s no real chorus to “Antabus”, just a refrain of “I don’t know what to say/ So fuck you!/ Fuck you!” Fittingly, “No Mercy” is even more direct<b>, </b>as<b> </b>Milner yells, “Fuck you for fucking me when I was 17...You never loved me/You wanted to own me."" The fine and crucial semantic distinctions of “fuck” apparently cross the language barrier and throughout <i>II</i>, there isn’t much romantic love, just the romanticization of young lust and teen angst. Those are part of the same continuum, though and when <i>II</i> taps into its eternal power, the cries from Milner’s bedroom nothing short of universal.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's easy to see such referential scene-setting presented as tongue-in-cheek, especially when it's applied to purely instrumental music.

Song titles like ""Pink iPhone"", ""Bejeweled iMac"", and ""Vanilla Musk"" suggest that <i>Amber's Stuff</i> possesses a distinctly personal weight, giving enough of a picture of what those associations might mean.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That said, the titles are more evocative of a specific place and time than the music is. Originally </span><a href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/sfv_acid/ambers_stuff/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>self-released as a CDR in 2011</span></a><span>, the associations of this music might linger, but the sound and the structure already feel like an older version of his style, a box of memorabilia leafed through briefly before moving on. Where </span><i>The Dwell </i><span>was an off-kilter, jittery, indirect route towards deep and ruminative deconstructions of DIY 4/4 fare, </span><i>Amber's Stuff </i><span>is more of a direct nod towards his sources, with clear lines of acid house, boogie funk, and electro running through it. If that makes it a fair bit less subversive than </span><i>The Dwell</i><span>, that's actually to its benefit, proving that SFV Acid's music can still possess resonance regardless.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There might not be much pranksterish Valley-culture affectations here, but there's still some lively 8-bit color. The </span><i>Pole Position </i><span>exhaust note of ""Cheddar Mercedes"" buzzes through a staccato hi-hat/clap pattern and sinks into a knowingly new wave mode; it could've come across as cheesily arch if it wasn't for the odd, aching lilt to the chiming keyboards that provide the melody. The reflective downtempo ambiance of cuts like ""Pink iPhone"", ""Video Journeys"", and ""Art and Drawings"" reveal a finesse with lighter-touch nods to 1980s R&amp;B and experimental electronics that shimmer with low-intensity energy, while closer ""And No Stress"" is proof that even with a basis of familiar, traditional acid house, Reynolds can spin off from those long-established 303 tropes into denser, more unpredictable turns towards free-flight freakouts. It's not world-beating innovation at work here, but reflecting back on the good times really doesn't have to be.</span></p></div>"|19308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19308-sfv-acid-ambers-songs/|6.6|Nate Patrin

Here’s a representative quote from the book: ""I almost have the feeling that I am writing about someone very remote from myself, someone I hardly know and whose life story I am only familiar with by hearsay. Someone who has gone far away, so that I can no longer meet him to ask how it really was."" Ristikivi’s narrator describes a condition of exile that’s less geographical than it is existential, a problem of the soul’s internal difference from itself more than a problem of passports. Think of this meditation on alienation and loss of self as a sort of epigraph to Maria Juur’s (Minerva’s real name) latest effort. Having moved from her own native Estonia to Brooklyn before writing and recording <i>Histrionic</i>, it’s perhaps natural that she would find connection in their mutual disconnectedness.</p>
<p><i>Histrionic</i> is the most confident of Juur’s three albums; here, her songs are stronger and more fully formed than on previous efforts. She incorporates an impressive array of electronic styles—dub, house, Eurodisco, breakbeat, urban club and even a bit of prog rock—while maintaining a strong lyrical thread and sonic identity of her own. But while her ability to hopscotch from one rhythmic lexicon shows of her technical skill and conceptual ambition, the record itself seems to suffer from the same sense of dissolution that worries Ristikivi’s narrator.</p>
<p>The role of the move to Brooklyn shouldn't be overstated. Sure, everyone there is from somewhere else, but Juur implies that you often find dull homogeneity where you might expect to see a diversity of styles, attitudes, and aesthetic concerns. In many ways, <i>Histrionic</i> sees Juur fighting that homogenization. She takes bits of dubby bass for ""Ivory Tower"", a blues sample for ""Interlude"", 2-step and even, maybe, a club beat reduced to a single thin tick for ""Treasures."" On ""Spirit of the Underground,” Juur sarcastically chants, ""Same places, same faces, everything's the same"" over the song's decidedly untrendy bits of prog synth and phasers.</p>
<p>Eventually, <i>Histrionic </i>turns into a love story, and Juur becomes a more dominant actor in her songs, which become smoother, more melodic, more danceable. In turn, her lyrics are purposefully cliché: ""I've been waiting for so long,"" ""You don't have to say you love me,"" ""Don't give it all up, boy."" ""Endgame"" begins with a vocal sample—""You're a fake""—and ends with Juur repeating a few lines about the end of a relationship: ""I brought you drinks/ I brought you flowers/ I read you books and talked for hours,"" suggesting it all amounted to nothing. This song may contain the only real moment of histrionics on <i>Histrionic</i>.</p>
<p>Critics have called Juur's vocals lazy and formless, but I don't hear them that way. She sings in watercolors instead of acrylics, the translucence makes it easier to hear new things when Juur layers, repeats, and delays her phrasing. She finds this world as cold as the larger one, and, having been hurt, seems to retreat into herself. ""Wolves and Lambs"" quotes Comte de Lautréamont's prose poem <i>Maldoror</i>, beginning with the lines ""I sought a soul that might resemble mine/ And I could not find it."" From there, she retreats back to her previous narcotic, hypnotizing self.</p>
<p><i>Histrionic</i> feels like a three-part story: A woman-in-exile feels alienated by her new environment, and finds it dominated by the same old elitism and rigidity. She decides that a one-to-one, personal connection may be the solution. This, too, seems flawed and unsatisfying. She then tries to find solace in who she originally was, but finds that impossible to recapture as well. In most ways <i>Histrionic</i> is Maria Juur’s most self-assured and cohesive work—she moves from song to song with purpose—but by the end of the record I felt like I knew her even less than when I began listening to it. Her alienation is contagious that way. And while I appreciate and perhaps even identify more strongly with <i>Histrionic</i>'s less formed songs, Juur's resistance to conformity often sounds like a resistance to passion. Commitment is overrated, but feeling isn't.</p></div>"|19231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19231-maria-minerva-histrionic/|6.8|Jessica Suarez

Funny things happen to solitary people in quiet places. You talk to yourself. You expand to fit the space. You realize ""you"" might be more than one person. Midway through her 2009 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12851-bird-brains/""><i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i></a>, Garbus tells a deadbeat lover she no longer needs him because she can always get pregnant with birds, which comes as terrific news. Her backup singers—a bevy of voices that seem to have fluttered out of a 1930s dish-soap ad—agree, which makes sense because they are also Merrill Garbus.</p>
<p>Her music has always been playful but extremely confident. The product of a liberal liberal-arts education, she has worked as a puppeteer and is often photographed wearing facepaint. At the height of the Occupy movement, she lead audiences from the theater into the street, guerrilla-style, and her music embodies an activist's urgency, filled with sounds that elbow their way to the front in order to be heard. She's an introvert's nightmare, and all she wants is for you to open your heart and sing.</p>
<p>Her third album, <i>Nikki Nack</i>, is more reserved than 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15321-w-h-o-k-i-l-l/""><i>w h o k i l l</i></a>, which isn't saying much. There are still songs that sound like playgrounds full of street kids ricocheting off each other like bumper cars. There are still nursery rhymes about body dysmorphia and white liberal guilt set to what sounds like Coke-bottle percussion from the undiscovered country. But there are also songs like ""Time of Dark"" and ""Look Around"", where Garbus seems to have made a conscious choice to slow down, and in slowing down, lets us see the muscle in her stride. tUnE-yArDs now sound less like buskers outside the neighborhood co-op than some blues-jazz combo from the near-future, severed from the traditions of the music but still somehow in touch with its spirit. (Two of the songs here were produced by Malay, who also worked on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange/""><i>Channel Orange</i></a>, and whatever Garbus lacks in marketing appeal to the alt-R&amp;B crowd she makes up for by actually having a powerful voice.) </p>
<p>Subtlety has never been at play for Garbus, who tends to tackle her subject matter like a child after a robotic mole at a carnival game. ""I come from the land of slaves/ Let's go Redskins, let's go Braves!"" she wails on ""Real Thing"". Her world is made up of broad irony and clashing patterns—one whose conflicts are obvious but painfully irresolvable. Earlier, on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16776-tune-yards-water-fountain/"">""Water Fountain""</a>, there's this vignette: ""I saved up all my pennies and I gave them to this special guy/ When he had enough of them he bought himself a cherry pie/ He gave me a dollar, a blood-soaked dollar/ I cannot get the spot out but it's okay, it still works at the store."" The imagery is violent but the delivery is sweet—then, you remember the cherry pie, red as blood. The most startling moment on <i>w h o k i l l</i> was when Garbus  fantasized about making love to a cop who arrested her brother, then confesses how liberated she feels by violence as the band breaks into an ecstatic calypso.</p>
<p>Nate Brenner reprises his <i>w h o k i l l</i> role here as a bassist, synth player, and co-writer, and the album also features contributions from Roomful of Teeth, a Grammy-winning vocal group who, like Garbus, enjoy doing things with their voices that most people would not classify as singing. But even as Garbus opens up tUnE-yArDs to other collaborators, her albums still appear to be the work of a solitary kid in a basement, jerry-rigging her own fun with the help of imaginary friends. It is private music, splattered outward.</p>
<p>Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>, Garbus is an artist who lives with weird but flirts with normal. Gone is the chipper ukulele of <i>w h o k i l l </i>and <i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i>; <i>Nikki Nack</i> signifies maturity while still allowing room for Garbus to do zany things like scat-sing ""One two three o'clock/ Four o'clock, walk and walk and talk and talk and walk and talk and then/ Five, six, seven—seven—seven—heaven—heaven—take me again"" for 90 seconds straight on full tilt. In moments when Garbus does calm down, she does it with the grace and certainty of an archer drawing back her bow—less a concession than a show of power. </p></div>"|19314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19314-tune-yards-nikki-nack/|8.1|Mike Powell

Their eight-minute krautrock half-marathon <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11151-sea-within-a-sea/"">“Sea Within a Sea”</a> boasted affiliations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead"">Portishead</a>’s Geoff Barrow, acclaimed video director Chris Cunningham, and former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"">the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain</a> bassist Douglas Hart. It left no doubt that 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12998-primary-colours/""><i>Primary Colours</i></a> intended to erase the memory of the “psychotic sounds for freaks and weirdos” that typified their shlocky shock-goth debut <i>Strange House</i>; two years later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12252-still-life/"">“Still Life”</a> was an obvious tell of the John Hughes-in-IMAX, cloudgazing reveries to come on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15645-skying/""><i>Skying</i></a>.</p>
<p>So it goes, then, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54092-watch-the-horrors-i-see-you-lyric-video/"">""I See You""</a>, the first glimpse of their fourth LP <i>Luminous</i>: you could spend all seven-and-a-half minutes of thinking of adjectives to describe this dazzling moonshot and still not come up with anything better than “luminous.” But the title of the song is even more telling, considering its likeness to <i>Skying</i>’s second single, “I Can See Through You”, highlighting the biggest obstacle <i>Luminous</i> faces; it's at turns utterly breathtaking and vaguely familiar, but in the end it just sorta sounds like <i>Skying</i>.</p>
<p>The similarities between old and new are disappointing if you value how the Horrors have made radical transformations from album to album. But in the longview, they’ve always been driven by the same instincts and ambitions: regardless of whether they were invoking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"">the Cramps</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure"">the Cure</a>, this is spot-the-reference record collector rock, and <i>Luminous</i> is the first time they haven’t completely ditched the vinyl from their last time out. It’s an incremental move towards the edge of the '90s, where the band slips inside this Hacienda, coloring with sunlight and glowsticks rather than pretty in pink pastels.</p>
<p><i>Luminous</i> opens with about three minutes of anticipatory electronic murmuring, bongos, and birdcall before “Chasing Shadows” turns on the klieg lights and lets the beat drop for a crowd of thousands who will completely lose their shit. The gleaming acoustic guitar strums that open “First Day of Spring” could’ve been pickpocketed from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5891-happy-mondays"">Happy Mondays</a> during their 24-hour party stupor. This is still music meant for the biggest crowd possible, only now the Horrors sound more suited for the festival grounds rather than a hockey arena.</p>
<p>Still, the Horrors aren’t Madchester purists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31037-jagwar-ma"">Jagwar Ma</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5730-cut-copy/"">Cut Copy</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18689-cut-copy-free-your-mind""><i>Free Your Mind</i></a>. There’s too much composure in this hardworking, stylized music—the jeans are still black and skinny instead of baggy. It’s <i>Screamadelica</i> dosed on trustworthy hallucinogens, or <i>Pills 'n' Thrills &amp; Bellyaches </i>if we're talking about smooth, green gelcaps rather than hairspray-tasting E tablets. Or, think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12208-the-stone-roses"">the Stone Roses</a>, the outlier of that scene in that they always just seemed like a rock band dabbling in club sounds, utilizing extended guitar codas and the occasional mechanistic thump in the place of actual groove.</p>
<p>In other words, <i>Luminous</i> is <i>Skying</i> with faster tempos, which might only qualify as dance music at ca. 2000 ""Britpop nights"" at American bars, the setting that the Horrors truly belong in. They’re a throwback to the post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead"">Radiohead</a>, studio-nerd likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1135-doves"">Doves</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1314-elbow"">Elbow</a>, acts that attracted Yanks looking towards the UK because those bands seemed more interested in guitar pedals and electronic trickery. It’s easy enough to say <i>Luminous</i> sounds like a million bucks, but that’s not really a figure of speech<b>—</b>just about every moment here gives you an opportunity to itemize the recording budget, from whatever gets the bass on “Jealous Sun” to sound like a steamroller to the battery of guitar pedals that achieve the streaking comet sound of “Mine and Yours” and the quasar swirl of “Falling Star”.</p>
<p>And yet you wonder just how much the actual people in the Horrors have invested themselves in all of this; they come off like a band that wants to play for a stadium full of people that still don’t know the first thing about them. As with Skying, it’s a high compliment to say Luminous is a giant bowl of assorted, premium ear candy, and it’s about as nourishing, which maybe is the point. Faris Badwan’s vocals are perfectly situated within his imperious surroundings—half drama king, half complacent plutocrat—and his lyrics can read like nonsense, sounding like grand proclamations before dissipating completely the moment he moves on to the next thought. Whether it’s the hint of a bizarre love triangle on “Change Your Mind” or seemingly stern repetitions like “So now you know/ Turn away”, nothing really seems like that big of a deal.  They have have mastered their sound and vision, and hopefully they can grow to recognize their heart and soul, too.</p></div>"|19315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19315-the-horrors-luminous/|6.7|Ian Cohen

The San Jose rapper’s unorthodox backstory easily situates him within the broader, border-crossing movement that, thanks to peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30311-le1f/"">Le1f</a>, <a href=""https://bigbabygandhi.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Baby Ghandi</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29764-cities-aviv/"">Cities Aviv</a>, seeps steadily into hip- hop’s consciousness. “Post-internet” labels aside, it’s easy to see why his two most recent mix tapes, <i>End of Earth</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17838-antwon-in-dark-denim/""><i>In Dark Denim</i></a>, were received with enthusiasm: combining vaporwave synths, Death-Grips-style compression, and Biggie worship into a cohesive rap song is hard enough, and tougher still when sex jams are one of your main specialties. Somehow, Antwon pulled it off. On his new album, <i>Heavy Hearted in Doldrums</i>, the rapper constructs his boldest collection yet, grounded in improved production and his characteristic schoolboy wit.</p>
<p>If the album’s mildly redundant title and its po-faced track list don’t make it clear enough, Antwon’s grown sulkier since we last saw him. From the shadowy posturing of “Cold Tears”—this album’s closest thing to a banger—to the molasses-thick, melancholic  “Don’t Care”, <i>Heavy Hearted in Doldrums</i> is often mired in sorrow. But the sadness is ultimately powerless before the rapper’s insatiable libido. In spite of his laments on “Loser” (“I used to have a heart/ It once was filled with love”), Antwon continues to approach sex with the bushy-tailed perspective of a teenager who’s just been handed his driver’s license. “She bust seven times, made a nigga feel great!” he crows on “Break Yo' Back”, a boast he supports throughout the album with his many, many references to oral sex. Wacky erotic banter remains his biggest strength, fueled by a warmhearted, sex-positive spirit that recalls fellow horn dog <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a>, or perhaps, a kinkier Biz Markie. Even when he’s being a creep (“As long as your Dad don’t care/ I’ma run my fingers through your baby hairs”) or indulging his bad habit of running a phrase like “bust in threes” into the ground, you’ve got to admire his originality, not to mention his gusto. At the very least, he’s leagues above the majority of his guests, whose contributions to this album range from tight (Lil Ugly Mane’s crossfaded musings on “Rain Song”) to irremediably tepid (Wiki’s shrill, stilted verse on ""No Metro Nome”).</p>
<p><i>Heavy Hearted in Doldrums</i> has been billed as Antwon’s first proper “album”, a distinction that translates into some much-needed upgrades in production. Most notably, there’s none of the dodgy mixing that rendered portions of <i>In Dark Denim</i> downright unlistenable. After the cramped sonics of the past, even the first few seconds of the Sean Kemp-produced, “Rain Song” feel overwhelming: a sudden onslaught of ambient nature sounds, cavernous chorals, and somber violins before the bongo beat comes creeping in. When Antwon finally comes in over the primal beat, his voice doesn’t have to fight for space, so even a stale hook like “She’s got me up all night doing that rain dance” gets a vital dose of immediacy.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the mix is immaculate. It suffers from a serious dearth of bass, and frequently overemphasizes their weaker aspects, like the cheap synths that drive  “Mr. Intercontinental”. “KLF ELF”, the worst offender in this regard, includes a refreshingly ribald guest verse from Das Racist’s Heems that packs in a reference to Olivia Benson from “Law and Order: SVU”, but it’s hard to appreciate the rapper’s wit when he’s muffled by Pictureplane’s blaring calisthenics jams. Were this another run-of-the-mill mixtape, these flaws could easily be overlooked. But considering the fact that <i>Heavy Hearted in Doldrums</i> was funded by a <a href=""https://unifclothing.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clothing company </a>that charges upwards of 50 bucks for a faux-distressed t-shirt, one would think there’d be fewer duds.</p>
<p>Last summer, Antwon crossed paths with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a> guitarist Kerry McCoy for a washed-out remix of <i>In Dark Denim</i>’s title track, hinting at a possible new scheme through which his two selves, Crusthead and Biz Markie .gif incarnate, could be joined in anguish. Instead of putting these new configurations to the test, <i>Heavy Hearted in Doldrums</i> tinkers with the made-in-the-‘90s blueprint he’s been using from the start, with solid and safe results. That framework suits the rapper just fine, but listening to this album, you can’t help but wish for his dirty genius to fester into something fiercer.</p></div>"|19262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19262-antwon-heavy-hearted-in-doldrums/|7.3|Zoe Camp

Considering the nondescript name, the album title of their debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16225-young-magic-melt/""><i>Melt</i></a><i>,</i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16225-young-magic-melt/""><i> </i></a>and its smeared cover art, the duo of Isaac Emmanuel and Melati Malay appeared hellbent on confirming presumptions of them as another post-chillwave purveyor of amorphous, watercolor synth-and-sample ambience. Most of <i>Melt</i> turned out to be just that, except all that all tidal ebb and flow crested into huge, crashing singles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12456-night-in-the-ocean/"">“Night in the Ocean</a>” and “You With Air”<b>—</b> the latter of which got a high-profile boost when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"">Purity Ring</a> interpolated it into “Grandloves” later that year on their hit LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16851-shrines/""><i>Shrines</i></a>. Their most accessible songs were the ones that made people take interest, and you'd think that wouldn't be lost on the duo. But on their new album <i>Breathing Statues</i>, they’re every bit as intent on blending in with the surrounding scenery instead of standing out. This time, they’re far more successful.</p>
<p>As with <i>Melt</i>, the intercontinental incubation period of <i>Breathing Statues </i>is the main talking point<b>—</b>before finishing the album in New York, Young Magic recorded in places such as Morocco, France, and New Zealand. And yet, regardless of the passport stamps and frequent flier mileage the Aussie/Indonesian duo accumulated, <i>Breathing Statues </i>could've come from just about any MPC-masher who spent the past two years living in the Twittersphere. Similar to hundreds of likeminded acts with hazy sonics, hazy boundaries between “producer” and “band,” and a desire to still operate under the tag of “indie,” Young Magic’s taken a decidedly darker, more coldly minimal tack since 2012<b>—</b>lurching bass, ice-grilled snares, and pitched down vocals help leech the fluorescent color out of the comparatively vibrant <i>Melt</i>. I’d imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus""><i>Yeezus</i></a> got some serious run in their iPods.</p>
<p>But there's never a sense of the artistic process, development, or internal inspiration that went into <i>Breathing Statues.</i> The band's new tricks resemble updated software—patches being dragged and clicked onto a horizontal timeline. The woofer-blowing bass judder that opens “Cobra” makes for an intriguing start, but then Young Magic let the figure carry the entire four minutes by itself. A similar effect happens with “Foxglove”, which features the kind of vacuum-packed, freeze-dried synth tones that lets you know they’ve shared their colleagues' fixation on the <i>idea </i>of listening to<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade""> Sade</a>, or most likely, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye"">Rhye</a>—but there’s no heat being generated underneath. Meanwhile, the screwed moans of “Mythnomer” are the only reminder that Emmanuel sorta-kinda rapped on <i>Melt</i>, and subsequently <i>Breathing Statues </i>could've used <i>anything </i>on that questionable element's level of generating tension with Malay’s airy, anonymous breath-sing.</p>
<p>Nothing here bears the strain of overzealous ambition, there are no flubbed notes, unseemly textures, unfortunate lyrical ideas; everything positive or negative about <i>Breathing Statues </i>is simply too ephemeral to make a fuss about. It's an album of which the main purpose is to take up space, whether it’s in a retail setting, as background in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsrYymcvGFs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">visually arresting videos</a>, or as news fodder for content-hungry websites and as raw materials for their friends to remix. Even if I can’t imagine anyone outside those realms being excited about <i>Breathing Statues</i>, it completely justifies its existence as a record that aspires to exist as content.</p></div>"|19212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19212-young-magic-breathing-statues/|4.0|Ian Cohen

For more than a decade, the deliberately enigmatic, incredibly abrasive project has cloaked black metal beats and screams and maniacal guitar playing in a dynamic web of harsh noise and electronic contortion. At first, the result might sound slipshod and spontaneous, the result of an anti-production that captures performances of proper, discrete songs and turns them into messy, unidentifiable jumbles. But Wold’s best work is the product of fastidious and hostile arrangement, where those layers of song and manipulation move in forever-unsettled patterns. Finding the tune or even the rhyme and reason within a Wold cut suggests watching a ghost emerge from the fog: The eyes strain against an inscrutable background and slowly spot unexpected shapes, while the brain constantly second-guesses the detective work. It’s this daunting game—and Wold’s power over it—that makes the project’s albums so compelling, not the refrains.</p>
<p>But the centerpiece of <i>Postsocial</i>, Wold’s seventh album and second since the act relocated from Saskatchewan to Rhode Island, is actually an identifiable hook. Surrounded on all sides by chirping and choking noise near the start of “Five Points,” Wold leader Fortress Crookedjaw shouts the title itself 10 times (or rather, in two sets of five times, he might prefer). In the willfully obscure world of Wold, it is an absolutely lucid proclamation, decipherable even without the aid of a lyric sheet. During the next 10 minutes, Wold pushes ahead with usual ferocity. A thrashing guitar riff fights against the blanket of static beneath it, and Crookedjaw’s increasingly beleaguered bleat soon battles them both. The tumult rises so that, by the six-minute mark, his words have become mostly indecipherable ruminations on and symbolic explorations of <a href=""http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/dun/dun03.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Masonic structures</a>, an extension of the content from their 2012 masterpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16147-freermasonry/"" target=""_blank""><i>Freermasonry</i></a>. But when Crookedjaw returns to the refrain, he again powers through the melee with two more sets of five proclamations—<a href=""http://www.wheatandtares.org/7503/the-sacred-embrace-as-five-points-of-fellowship/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Five points/five points…”</a>—after the song’s verses. He peaks above his own machine’s power. Yes, “Five Points” is a squall of explosive sound and sustained noise, but it’s also a <i>song</i> with a perceptible chorus-verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure, so long as you’re willing to peer through the fog to find it.</p>
<p>“Five Points” might sound like a pretty wretched formula for a pop tune—bury everything until all that remains is some phantom of a refrain—but in all of Wold’s output, it is perhaps the clearest illustration of the finesse that empties into this incorrigible belligerence. In fact, the bulk of <i>Postsocial</i> pulls back the electrostatic drapes a bit more than its predecessors, allowing the cores beneath the clamor to resonate a bit more readily. Opener “Throwing Star,” for instance, suggests a violent hardcore romp played by a boombox that’s been sealed inside a plastic barrel and tossed down a metallic staircase. But get past the bedlam, and listen to the levels shift. “Throwing Star” feels alternately like a no-low-end void and, in spots, like a recording session where the only fully functional microphone was attached to the bass amplifier.</p>
<p>Such amoeboid acoustics are Wold’s best trick. “Spiral Star Inversion” might seem to follow a less-identifiable path, as there are no rhythms underpinning it and no refrains anchoring it; instead, Crookedjaw divides five stanzas of a prurient poem about ghoulish copulation across 14 minutes, making it the longest piece in Wold’s oeuvre. It straddles the divide between being brutal and beautiful, and the latter word is rarely associated with Wold. It’s still unforgiving music, laced with electronic samples that suggest metal scraped and stabbed against metal and crackling with a static that seems to come from a cesspool of Rice Krispies wired with contact microphones (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"">the Dead C</a> at their most vile) but a gigantic two-tone pulse lingers just beneath the mess, glowing like the more radiant music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>. The track is a wonderland of control, a series of musical mirages nested inside one another, testing the borders between punishment and relaxation.  </p>
<p>With Wold, all of these qualities or components—beauty, hooks, refrains, rhythms—are necessarily relative. Though moments on both <i>Freermasonry</i> and <i>Postsocial</i> offer more points of entry into their cloaked, claustrophobic universe than previous records, Wold remains some of the moment’s most brittle and confrontational fare. And there’s an absurdist foundation beneath it all, of course, with interpretations of secret Masonic rites hurled against a barely buttressed oblivion by someone who calls himself Fortress Crookedjaw. Not unlike those Masons, though, there is endless intrigue just past the surface, as Wold continues to raise more questions than their music would ever dare to answer. Even when the hook stands out against the din, as it does at the middle of <i>Postsocial</i>, Wold delivers a disorienting mix of power and poise, thickly veiled and wonderfully bewildering.</p></div>"|19194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19194-wold-postsocial/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

The titles alone feel like disclaimers—are you willing to live life on <i>these</i> terms? It's worth noting, then, that Lykke Li moved over 5,400 miles from her native Sweden to Los Angeles at the age of 28 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9392-lykke-li-better-off-alone/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">after the most painful breakup of her life</a>. It hardly matters that almost none of us will experience anything like that; what is important is that many of us have endured the kind of heartbreak that made it <i>feel</i> like your old self is halfway across the planet. But if you’ve ever just secretly hoped your life could inspire such romantic ideals of romantic failure, wish fulfillment doesn’t come more potent than <i>I Never Learn</i>.</p>
<p><i>I Never Learn</i> is both spartan and expansive; it's Li’s most ambitious <i>and</i> shortest album, at nine songs and 33 minutes. This is widescreen drama meant to hit with direct and precise impact, so the operative term for advance singles “No Rest For the Wicked” and “Love Me Like I’m Not Made of Stone” has been “Spector-esque.” It's a fair comparison, as Li plays a winner-take-all game of “He loves me, he loves me not” accompanied by a host of string players and drums that beat and thump like a flawed human heart. Li relies on classic emotive archetypes as well—excepting <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9nPf7w7pDI&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Will Always Love You”</a>, torch songs don’t get much more literal than “Never Gonna Love Again”, and as with most of <i>I Never Learn</i>, its incapacitating sense of impending emptiness is closer in spirit to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19LPgLKrgLE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Have Nothing”</a>.</p>
<p>The power ballads are just what the tag implies: ballads that require an enormous amount of exertion and are about power itself, whether it’s helplessly putting in the hands of another (“Love Me Like I’m Not Made of Stone”), taking ownership of your culpability (“No Rest For the Wicked”), or watching it disappear in a moment of passion (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54806-lykkie-li-shares-new-song-gunshot/"">“Gunshot”</a>). Rather than evoking a specific decade of music, though, Li approaches this style of songwriting as musical theater that should be created by something other than a proper band—either by professionals just off-screen, or some kind of studio magic.</p>
<p><i>I Never Learn</i> utilizes the simplest tools of confessional songwriting: uneasily strummed acoustic guitars and resonant piano chords enlarged for texture and dramatic flair, like they’re appearing from behind a just-raised curtain, or from a radio as you sing to yourself. Thanks to the cavernous production, the enduring mental image of <i>I Never Learn</i> isn’t Li slumping over a glass of whiskey, but rather letting fresh wounds breathe, soundchecking alone in an empty arena.</p>
<p>Note the word “arena”, because even if these are stark, personal songs, there’s a tacit acknowledgment here of Li's status as a pop star on the verge. She drops a lot of the ingratiating and occasionally grating mannerisms of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11414-youth-novels/""><i>Youth Novels</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15167-wounded-rhymes/""><i>Wounded Rhymes</i></a> that could be viewed as defense mechanisms—coyly sung melodies, the coquettish humor, and the booming beats and handclaps that endeared her to many but could also did little to dispel the idea of her as a benefactor of “Young Folks”’ cottage industry of meet-cute indie-pop. The onyx-and-gray, dead serious, striking cover shot of <i>I Never Learn</i> isn’t fronting on you; Li hangs around David Lynch, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54902-aap-rocky-jumps-on-lykke-lis-no-rest-for-the-wicked/"">collaborates with A$AP Rocky</a> and admires <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake"">Drake</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna"">Rihanna</a>, all of whom commingle celebrity and artistry to serve as avatars, people through whom we can imagine how our idealized selves might sing, dress, fuck, or hurt.</p>
<p>Li is not a tabloid fixture nor a force of nature, and <i>I Never Learn</i> takes advantage of that by emphasizing the rawness of her lower registers and utilizing negative space to keep things from getting too far out of proportion. At times, the record resembles a pocket version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele"">Adele</a>’s eternal <i>21</i>. Yes, “Love Me Not I’m Not Made of Stone” does American teenagers a disservice by showing up a couple weeks late for prom season, but right when Li chokes on the line, “Even though it….<i>hurts</i>,” she negates any idea of this being makeout music; it’s more like getting told ""let's be friends"" in the middle of a slow dance.  </p>
<p>The artillery-riddled, burnished metal of “Gunshot” was helmed by Greg Kurstin, best known as a collaborator of P!nk, Kelly Clarkson and Katy Perry—but he’s also the guy who produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4371-tegan-and-sara/"">Tegan &amp; Sara</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17597-heartthrob""><i>Heartthrob</i></a>, another record that commingled teenaged emotions with adult situations and vice versa while nudging a beloved, modest act in a way that led to a polished, radio-ready album that reflected their real-life popularity.</p>
<p>“Gunshot” is <i>I Never Learn</i>’s fist-pumping climax <i>and</i> a total outlier, as longtime producer <span>Björn</span> Yttling still handles the majority of <i>I Never Learn</i>, his trademark, treble-harshed reverb making each lovelorn lullaby sound like it’s smeared with Li's own tears and ruined makeup. That lends a crucial, tactile reality in Li's sadness, since very few of her lyrics are going to remind people of things their significant others have actually said to them—“Every time the rain falls, think of me.”  “Baby wait a lifetime before you find somebody new”, “Every time I pay the price for a heart that can’t be broken.” Maybe you've <i>thought </i>these things, and hearing them out in the open ensures <i>I Never Learn</i> isn’t an admission of defeat; there’s an unspoken uplift to be had, that you can only hurt this badly after loving way too hard. A chorus of Lykke Li's sing the title of “Never Gonna Love Again”, whereas the gospel choir does the same with “Heart of Steel”, either taunts or acceptance of a fate where grand, sweeping sulks are just a natural and welcome state of being. We’re used to breakup albums that assume you just want to crawl into a hole and die, but <i>I Never Learn </i>is for the times when heartbreak is so life-affirming that you want to share the feeling with the world.</p></div>"|19312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19312-lykke-li-i-never-learn/|8.4|Ian Cohen

In 1996 he published a book titled <i>A Year With Swollen Appendices</i>, which detailed his extraordinary life over a 12-month span. Even his quiet days, it seems, have some sense of purpose to them. For the book's September 25 entry<i>, </i>he doesn’t do much at all, aside from noting two phone calls that came through: one from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>, the other from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">Paul McCartney</a>. Although much has surely changed since then, his workrate hasn’t dipped, and the albums keep coming. His latest, <i>Someday World</i>, is a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4418-underworld/"">Underworld</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31209-karl-hyde/"">Karl Hyde</a>, and, like much of Eno’s recent output, it’s released by <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a>. Eno hasn't exactly given this album the hard sell, instead presenting it as a collection of half-thoughts he tried to salvage after browsing through a stray hard drive one afternoon. “I had a big collection of 'beginnings' sitting around waiting for something to galvanise them into life, to make them more than just 'experiments,'"" he said in advance of the album's release.</p>
<p>So <i>Someday World</i> may not be built on the most exciting premise, but even Eno’s malformed thoughts are usually worth a look, or a listen, or a read, depending on which medium he’s currently working in. Here, he brings in a group of collaborators alongside Hyde, including familiar accomplices (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"">Roxy Music</a>’s Andy Mackay, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>’s Will Champion), a family member (his daughter, Darla Eno), and a co-producer in his early twenties (Fred Gibson). It sounds expensive, in the way that Eno’s production for Coldplay or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"">U2</a> often does, although with less obvious ambition beyond being an outlet for a group of people to work in ways they perhaps haven’t before. There’s form and structure, although whether it was always there or devised after the fact is difficult to discern. As <i>Someday World</i> progresses, it gradually falls into that bracket of projects that were probably much more fun to record than they are to listen to.</p>
<p>Eno <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7875-brian-eno/"">talked</a> about how we are “deep in the grid period of making music” in reference to computer-based composition in 2010, and that's the place this album is rigidly stuck in. There’s no looseness here, very little space to move around in. The mode is largely set to “pop” throughout, but only in the sense that Eno and Hyde are reaching for catchy, polished rhythms. Strangely, for someone so reticent to expand on his past, it’s a resolutely backward looking work by Eno’s standards. Everything feels a little old, including the jungle-lite drums (“Daddy’s Car”), nods to '90s electronica (“When I Built This World”), and the creeping fear of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/831-13/""><i>13</i></a> (“Mother of a Dog”).</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that Hyde sounds particularly uninspired, only finding function on the obvious standout tracks (“Daddy’s Car”, “Who Rings the Bell”). The deliberate strain in his voice grates by the time track nine comes around, sounding like years of coasting through unremarkable Underworld albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14655-barking/""><i>Barking</i></a> has taken its toll. It may have been difficult for Hyde to find a way in here—the precision-tooled arrangements don’t often open up much room for him, leaving him stranded somewhere above the music but never fully immersed in it. He’s more observer than participant, letting a watching-the-world-go-by glassiness settle in as his vocals take a distinct back seat to the studio trickery.</p>
<p>The record runs out of steam around “Witness”, where a deadpan <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2929-miss-kittin/"">Miss Kittin</a>-style female vocal is threaded over the top. (Thankfully, it exits just as the ghosts of electroclash’s past are whipping at Eno and Hyde's ankles.)<i> Someday World</i> is well arranged, meticulously produced, even catchy at times. But there’s an overriding sense of aimlessness, of people just dropping by the studio and breezing into the songs before wafting off to a more important appointment. For an Eno work, it’s disappointingly lacking in direction.</p></div>"|19313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19313-brian-eno-karl-hyde-someday-world/|6.2|Nick Neyland

Stitching together lush synths and rigid, springy beat programs with thin golden wires of electric guitar, they made electro-pop feel metropolitan, dislocated and somewhat detached from human affairs—qualities embodied in David Best's aloof vocals and the smoothly machined forms they nestled into. Their music descended from 1970s German experimentalism at a time when krautrock hadn't yet become a common influence in indie music.</p>
<p>If Fujiya &amp; Miyagi started out ahead of a trend curve, they sounded increasingly commonplace over the intervening years, and at this point they’re the ones rushing to catch up. On new album <i>Artificial Sweeteners</i>, they inject their mannered krautrock with an energizing dose of techno, a shift ostensibly executed to propel them into contemporary relevance. The shift is immediately noticeable on opening track ""Flaws"", where a melting haze of kosmische ambiance and a rounded, lockstep bass that could have come from any of their albums accelerates towards a thrumming dance arpeggio that could only have come from this one. It's a neat, good-humored way for the band to spoof its own trajectory.</p>
<p>Throughout the record, Fujiya &amp; Miyagi prove adept at fitting together sequences at higher BPMs, twiddling knobs, triggering gates, and tailoring filters to make the music dynamically slingshot around tight corners. But none of that saves the record from feeling rather stale—even anonymous—in a musical climate that's currently awash in such stuff. The productions can be deft and exciting, with a wide variety of timbres smartly meshed to distinguish the otherwise cookie-cutter tracks.</p>
<p>But the vocal performances are flat and tiresome, offering a wan surface for emotional connection—which is problematic now that the music has leaned away from sculptural forms and toward a more kinetic, direct, and engaging style. Best seemingly aims for louche in his delivery but stops short at toneless and, at times, downright silly, with faux-dramatic whispers as the rare source of variation in his gray mutterings. The band excels when the singer gets out of its way, as on ""Rayleigh Scattering"", a tensely scudding mini-odyssey that lofts and dips on powerful bass currents, where the lead synth melody is more eloquent than the cipher-like lyrics that resemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/"">Matthew Dear</a> doing Dr. Seuss. </p>
<p>The slit-eyed vocals, dance beats, and funk guitars of <i>Artificial Sweeteners</i> bear a strong resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/916-chk-chk-chk/"">!!!</a>, another band that started off fresh but then got stale as the culture it was once at the vanguard of caught up with and, eventually, lapped it. Similarly, Fujiya &amp; Miyagi have skill as producers but, at this point, they don't have much to say. <i>Artificial Sweeteners</i> certainly isn't a terrible album, and it does the trick if you're just looking for a quick pick-me-up, but it leaves a bland aftertaste.</p></div>"|19264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19264-fujiya-miyagi-artificial-sweeteners/|5.8|Brian Howe

His gaze spans from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a> to contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"">Grizzly Bear</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Beach House</a>—the latter’s guitarist, Alex Scally, is an occasional collaborator—and he filters the sounds of these groups using his voice, a woolly and versatile instrument that moves from breathy melancholy to a lapsed choirboy falsetto with ease. Quever’s new full-length, <i>Life Among the Savages</i>, places a spotlight on his skills as a producer and arranger playing with several new variations on his warm, woodsy music.</p>
<p>From a production standpoint, <i>Life Among the Savages</i> sounds consistently strong, even when songs swell to accommodate Quever's dense arrangements. The album was mostly recorded in his San Francisco home studio, so comfort and familiarity clearly informs its bright sound. The record is an easy, pleasant listen, but it's not particularly compelling as a whole, occasionally falling into a pattern of contented stuffiness. Quever can't always cut through the light fog of his arrangements with his gentle, fuzzy vocal takes, so he has to rely on the strength of his melodies and arrangements to keep songs from turning soporific.</p>
<p>After a baroque opening third, the record starts to wake up on ""Staring at the Bright Lights"", where Quever lays down a distant, ringing guitar line that corrodes and sparks as the song unfolds. The song sounds a little like the luminous, spacious guitar pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"">Deerhunter</a> guitarist Lockett Pundt's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22753-lotus-plaza/"">Lotus Plaza</a> project, a welcome change from the album's more uptight moments. Strong guitar leads factor in <i>Life Among the Savages</i>' finest moments: the dusty, late-1960s ramble of ""Family Portrait"", the knotty patterns of ""Psychic Friends"".</p>
<p>Just as Quever's music consciously roots itself in time-honored pop and folk traditions, his lyrics are imbued with a similar sense of setting: he makes note of times and places—""Psychic Friends"" finds him cataloging memories against the backdrop of a chilly winter equinox—and uses natural imagery well, like the wilderness detailing of ""Afterlife Blues."" There's also a palpable sadness often hanging around Quever's writing, an off-kilter sense of dread; on tracks like ""New Body"" and ""Family Portrait,"" that sense works against the songs' musical lightness, creating intriguing tension. That valuable tension is just another expression of the truth that lurks in the background throughout <i>Life Among the Savages</i>: Quever realizes his true potential when he eschews easy comfort and warmth to introduce elements that are a little more challenging.</p></div>"|19316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19316-papercuts-life-among-the-savages/|6.7|Jamieson Cox

It worked so well they kept it up and began writing songs together, eventually forming a full band with Mark Messerly (bass) and Joe Klug (Wussy’s second drummer). For <i>Attica!</i>, Wussy also brought pedal-steel player and former Ass Pony John Erhardt into the fold.</p>
<p>Wussy is quintessentially Midwestern. It’s hard to imagine their sincere, blue-collar, decidedly untrendy songs coming from either coast. The band doesn’t hesitate to borrow some alt-country sounds from Cleaver’s days in the Ass Ponys, but even with that pedal steel there’s nothing Southern about Wussy. They sound like a band from the early- to mid-’90s, but they’re not overly grungy, and you can’t really fold them in with much of the college rock from that decade, either. There are big hooks, drones, acoustic instruments, mellotron, fuzz. Wussy is familiar yet wonderfully uncategorizable. It’s the sound you’d hope would result from a grizzly stonemason now in his mid-’50s recruiting a woman almost 20 years younger to not just accompany but co-lead a band of fellow Ohioans who love rock that pops.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.wussy.org/?projects=buckeye"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Buckeye</i></a>, a compilation released on UK label Damnably in 2012, collected 17 of Wussy’s greatest hits that never were from previous albums. It’s a good place to start for newbies, but <i>Attica!</i> is a perfectly fine entry point, as well; Walker and Cleaver get an equal shake on just about every release. It’s surprisingly rare to hear arguments about who’s the greater or preferred Wussy warbler. Walker’s range and clarity would win in a reality show sing-off, but the two voices have a lot in common. They share a rumpled desperation that somehow never sounds resigned, kicking hard enough to keep ever-encroaching despair from taking over completely.<br/><br/><i>Attica!</i>—Wussy’s fifth album of new material if you don’t count 2011’s <i>Funeral Dress II</i>, an acoustic reworking of 2005 debut <i>Funeral Dress</i>—is a nostalgic record, and not just because of that vaguely ’90s sound. It’s an album about growing up and remembering and, of course, the relationships that accompany those remembrances. (It seems worth noting that Cleaver and Walker were in a long-term, tempestuous romantic relationship in the not too distant past.) The album showcases everything Wussy is good at, particularly the band’s portrayal of their fractured homeland. You can see it vividly in the broken-down Pontiacs and frozen lakes and women too poor to take the pill and street drinking and house fires started by cigarettes. <br/><br/>If a song title like “Rainbows and Butterflies” brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28430-owl-city/"" target=""_blank"">Owl City</a> or Lisa Frank, the song’s crunchy power chords, which deconstruct slightly as they go, erase all that, providing a dark backdrop to Cleaver’s couplets that start off troubling (“I’m gonna kill you…”) and resolve as lovey-dovey promises (“...with goodness and light”). It’s something Wussy does all over <i>Attica!</i>, and what they’ve always done. Cleaver and Walker like to set up a lyric in a way you think you know where it’s going right before it goes somewhere else entirely. “I’m not the monster that I once was/ 20 years ago I was more beautiful than I am today,” they sing in unison on anthemic closing track “Beautiful.” (The song’s two-chord progression bears a strong resemblance to “Little Paper Birds,” leadoff track on Wussy’s self-titled 2009 album.) The refrain repeats until you start to realize what’s beautiful to Wussy and what’s not.<br/><br/>Even with a minute-long instrumental outro, “Beautiful” feels tight, ending before the 4:30 mark. Wussy songs tend to be that way—compact packages with maximum singability and staying power squeezed into minimal space. Sometimes the songs can feel <i>too</i> tight, if that’s even a thing. When I saw Wussy play “Beautiful” at last year’s Nelsonville Music Festival, they stretched out the ending until the seams frayed; the mantra-like chorus, drone-fuzz guitars and strummed bass erupted like a lost Yo La Tengo outtake. Perhaps “Beautiful” was destined to be more taut when put to tape, but there’s some unspent potential energy in the <i>Attica!</i> version’s coda.<br/><br/>Walker pays homage to the Who in first track “Teenage Wasteland"", a pop song that rivals its namesake. She references “Baba O’Riley” and the band’s <a href=""http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-who-spark-an-explosion-on-national-television"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">legendarily explosive</a> <i>Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour</i> performance (“When the kick of the drum went off like artillery fire”), but it’s less about classic-rock head nods and double entendres and more about capturing what it’s like to be a kid and finding a band you connect with on the deepest level imaginable. “Do you remember the moment you finally did something about it? When the kick of the drum lined up with the beat of your heart?” Walker asks at the top of the song. Then, at the end of the song—sounding as if she can’t contain the exhilaration—she describes the feeling in more detail: “For one short breath it sounds like the world is ending, exploding in space and beginning again so far away.” It’s the moment that turns suffering into transcendence because someone else feels the way you do, and that person felt compelled to translate it into music. I’d argue that’s what we’re looking for most of the time when we listen to music—that band or album or song or even a few notes that make us marvel and proclaim, like Walker does, “Your misery sounds so much like ours.” At Wussy’s best—and <i>Attica!</i> is pretty close to that—they’re capable of doing for us what Pete and Roger and Keith and John did for them.</p></div>"|19259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19259-wussy-attica/|7.8|Joel Oliphint

From the looks of things, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54316-neil-young-launches-digital-music-serviceplayer-pono-with-help-from-arcade-fire-beck-jack-white-bruce-springsteen-patti-smith-more/"">Pono</a> seems to be the most practical application of Young's audio purism to date. He's been a loud critic of the mp3 and digital audio degradation for years, and he's embraced expensive and clunky listening formats to ensure that listeners are getting the best possible sound quality. His public persona in recent months has been that of ""expert audio purist""—decrying ""underwater listening"" behind a desk, driving record executive Mo Ostin around to show off the capabilities of his new format, and so forth.</p>
<p>So what's the first album Young puts out after raising $6.2 million for Pono <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1003614822/ponomusic-where-your-soul-rediscovers-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on Kickstarter</a>? A sepia-toned long-player with a sound that would sit comfortably next to late 1920s Jimmie Rodgers or Carter Family records. In fact, the sonic quality of Young's latest, <i>A Letter Home</i>, might be a little worse than its spiritual forebears: Young joined <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">Jack White</a> at his <a href=""http://thirdmanrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Third Man</a> HQ in Nashville, where he posted up in a 1940s phone-booth-size studio with limited resources—his acoustic guitar, a harmonica, a piano, and White—to record a handful of covers direct to vinyl. It's pretty much the sonic opposite of, say, his early collaborations with Jack Nitzsche. You can hear the continuous scrape of the grooves, pops, and momentary warps—tiny flaw after tiny flaw. Vintage-sounding and created using White's toys, it has all the appearance of a record featuring the guy who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18703-the-rise-fall-of-paramount-records-volume-one-1917-1932/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">encased Paramount's archives in an oak cabinet</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17727-the-mississippi-sheiks-blind-willie-mctell-charley-patton-the-complete-recorded-works-in-chronological-order-volume-1/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">gussied up old Charley Patton records</a>.</p>
<p>Young introduces the album with a letter to his dead mother, telling her that she should talk to his dad (his parents divorced in 1961), asking her to relay a message to his late bandmate <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Keith"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ben Keith</a>, and telling her about how the public turns on <a href=""http://www.algore.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Al, the weatherman</a>. It's a sweet, absurd bit of business that vaguely recalls his sense of humor from <a href=""http://thedissolve.com/features/interdisciplinary/94-the-dovetailing-musical-and-directorial-careers-of/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Human Highway</i></a>, and it frames the album as a care package to the afterworld, with songs and messages sounding like they're being transmitted via string-connected aluminum cans. This context renders his subsequent performance of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNbe3xYeTqI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phil Ochs' ""Changes""</a> heart-wrenching. His voice is quiet, his guitar is strummed tenderly, the song he sings is about aging and loss. ""Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else, one last cup of wine we'll pour/ And I'll kiss you one more time, and leave you on the rolling river shores of changes."" At one point in the song, he misses a chord change, which makes the performance feel incredibly human. After all, this is Neil Young, who's got an entire discography of impeccably recorded material. Those small flubs are like scratched out words on a page, and they make the record feel much more intimate.</p>
<p>For an album recorded primitively inside a Nashville box, there are some stunning performances on <i>A Letter Home</i>. The strongest moments on the album are the most delicate ones, which shouldn't come as a surprise for anyone who's spent any time with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LTiKJlB62g&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ambulance Blues""</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12497-sugar-mountain-live-at-canterbury-house-1968/""><i>Live at Canterbury House</i></a>. The restrained material is also better suited for this recording format. His stripped down readings of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ij_iTQt2w&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gordon Lightfoot's ""If You Could Read My Mind""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pqttl9aWm0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Early Morning Rain""</a> pares both songs back to their essentials—beautifully delivered acoustic rambles about being a long way from home and a pained look back at a relationship. On one of his two duets with White, a version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN0AIiupU1M&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Everly Brothers' ""I Wonder if I Care as Much""</a> that closes the album, their voices sound completely gorgeous together and neither White nor Young showboats. It's a loving, simple, well-done tribute.</p>
<p>Occasionally, though, the recording quality distracts from the album's content. Young's cover of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hardin</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bW6VZi0ICs&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Reason to Believe""</a> is partially blown by warped sound to the point where the original version sounds more assertive and fully realized than Neil's cover. Occasionally, Young will blow the harmonica too hard and temporarily mar every other sound; elsewhere, he covers songs that flat-out sound bad in the audio format they're presented in. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSMP_VvzxJo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Since I Met You Baby""</a> is an unessential, bleary version of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Joe_Hunter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ivory Joe Hunter</a>'s velvet R&amp;B original, while <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77gKSp8WoRg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""My Hometown""</a>, removed from the production of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Born in the U.S.A.</i></a>, is repetitive and a bad fit for Young's voice. The cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdlyi5mckg0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""On the Road Again""</a> is just a slapdash mess; White's vocals somehow sound abrasive, and similar to the Springsteen cover, Neil's voice just isn't well-suited to tackle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"">Willie Nelson</a>'s register.</p>
<p>Young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54333-jack-white-to-appear-on-neil-youngs-a-letter-home/"">said</a> the songs he picked to cover were ""songs that I love, songs that changed my life,"" and said behind the archaic recording quality was some ""beautiful music"". There's nothing more beautiful or potentially life-changing on <i>A Letter Home</i> than his take on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9C9tx-Bv3w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bert Jansch's ""Needle of Death""</a>. It's a gorgeous, heartbreaking song about a heroin overdose—it's devastating and beautiful coming from Young, a longtime Jansch disciple who also lost friends to the needle (and wrote some of his best songs about it).</p>
<p>There's a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H47jI6xanA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video of Young performing the song</a>, and at the end, White comes up and says, ""That sounded <i>good</i>."" Young replies, ""That's a heavy song."" He wasn't focused on how it sounded—he was thinking about what he was singing. In that way, <i>A Letter Home</i> doesn't contradict his work on Pono. Both projects, different as they are, stem from his deep love for the material. If anything, the crackling whistle that introduces ""Needle of Death"" speaks much more strongly to the life-changing power of music than any extra-musical project ever could.</p></div>"|19295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19295-neil-young-a-letter-home/|6.3|Evan Minsker

In 2011, he made what I thought was one of the loveliest indie-rock records of the year, but I had a lot of trouble convincing other people of that fact, because he decided to call the damn thing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15428-diaper-island/""><i>Diaper Island</i></a>. (Its most tender ballad? Well that would be ""Shave My Pussy"", of course.) As a visual artist, VanGaalen dabbles in various mediums; he's made <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RivjuMP8Ss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">animated videos</a>, <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/kp0e_EoQd0/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fantastical figurines</a> and a conceptual piece that was, according to a press release, ""a literal piece of shit in a hot dog bun."" Recently, he began posting <a href=""http://instagram.com/chadvangaalen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on his Instagram</a> whimsical drawings he had etched into snow: Here is a cute <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/mA-ZpDoQfX/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dinosaur</a>, a <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/mVig3NIQa5/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tugboat</a>, and what appears to be a <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/mI9yVBIQeR/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-portrait</a>. It was only after I'd admired a couple of them that I realized they were made out of pee.</p>
<p>But if everything VanGaalen touches seems to have a repellant, piss-pungent weirdness about it, that's kind of a ruse—his records of jangly junkyard-pop are warm, inviting, and surprisingly easy to love. His latest, <i>Shrink Dust</i>, is possibly his best, and certainly his most confident. These songs are gentle, sad, and just bizarre enough. (There's a streak of Cronenberg-ian body horror throughout, and it begins playfully unsettling image: ""Cut off both my hands and threw them in the sand/ Watch them swim away from me like a pair of bloody crabs"".) VanGaalen's called <i>Shrink Dust</i> his country record because it's his first where he makes use of a recently acquired pedal steel, but some of the quieter songs also feature the lonely-cricket chirps of a mouth bow that remind me of Leonard Cohen's <i>Songs from a Room</i>. Like that record, <i>Shrink Dust</i> has a slow, steady trot—like an eccentric stranger rolling into town on horseback, bemused but also made lonely by the vivid visions in his head.</p>
<p>VanGaalen records by himself at home, in a space that's equal parts<a href=""http://www.vice.com/practice-space/practice-space-chad-vangaalen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> garage studio and wacky inventor's laboratory</a>. He creates a lot of his own instruments from scratch: a two-person thumb piano; a narrow, portable harp; an analog drum machine that is dotted with Legos and looks more like a middle school science fair project than a rock instrument. Triggered by foot pedals or whirring by themselves with built-in motors, most of these jerry-rigged contraptions are designed to help VanGaalen act in the studio as a one-man band, but they also give his songs a homemade feel. Like all of his records (including the two he produced for the great, defunct Calgary art-rockers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26456-women/"">Women</a>), <i>Shrink Dust</i> is full of varied, ramshackle textures. Spacey lead-off single ""Where Are You?"" rumbles like rickety spaceship, its hollered title lyric echoing and warping through an unfamiliar atmosphere on its way back to earth. A gorgeous and languid love song in the vein of <i>Diaper Island</i>'s ""Sara"", ""Lila"" sounds like a crooner's ballad dissolving in a murky pond, with all the scummy creatures popping up to harmonize with VanGaalen on the surprisingly stirring chorus.</p>
<p>""I started out just experimenting with more… sound-scapey, ambient sort of experimental music,"" VanGaalen said <a href=""http://www.vice.com/practice-space/practice-space-chad-vangaalen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in an interview</a> a few years ago. ""The songs weren't really what I was concentrating on."" Since his 2004 debut <i>Infiniheart</i>, though, VanGaalen has moved towards uniting those ""song"" and ""soundscape"" tendencies with increasing seamlessness. For all its cosmic-cowboy vibes, <i>Shrink Dust</i> contains some of the catchiest and most assured hooks he's written yet—many of which are just a single word or phrase (""Evil"", ""Monster"", ""Lila"") that's been taffy-pulled into a graceful and memorable melody. Occasionally, as on the rather aimless ""Weird Love"", things get a little <i>too</i> plainspoken and laid back, but the psych-pop tune ""Leaning on Bells"" wakes up the back half of the record with a satisfying jolt of electricity.</p>
<p>In the middle of <i>Shrink Dust</i>, there's an upbeat folk-pop song called ""Monster"", which describes in vivid detail a Gregor Samsa/<i>Teen Wolf</i>-esque metamorphosis of man into beast: The singer suddenly sprouts quills, his skin turns ""scaly and yellowish brown"", his fingers wither away only to be replaced by claws. It's one of the creepiest-ever conceits for a jangly pop song, but there's also something cool—and quintessentially Chad VanGaalen—about it. It's like watching one of his surreal claymation creatures, odd drawings, or Frankenstein-esque instruments come together in real time. Chad VanGaalen's world is weird, but never just for weird's sake—his creations spring from deep inside the singular, twisted mind of their creator, and <i>Shrink Dust</i> is the closest we've come yet to getting inside his head.</p></div>"|19226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19226-chad-vangaalen-shrink-dust/|7.8|Lindsay Zoladz

Formed in the late 80s in Missoula, Montana, when some of its members were still teenagers, the band relocated to Seattle just in time for the marketing bonanza known as grunge, an invented genre that still somehow couldn't stretch to contain them. Like a lot their peers—including Pavement, Archers of Loaf, and a half-dozen other artists cresting on Matador or Merge in the 1990s—Silkworm sounded like musicians reared on classic rock as filtered through 80s hardcore and bands like Dinosaur Jr. or Sebadoh, who had turned the extroversion of rock'n'roll into something jagged and secret. And yet for however straightforward their influences were, something about Silkworm always seemed bent.</p>
<p><i>Libertine</i>, their third album,<i> </i>was recorded by the band's longtime engineer Steve Albini at a studio called Pachyderm, where Albini had recorded Nirvana's <i>In Utero</i> a year earlier. The music on it is rough-cut and powerful, like a cinder block rendered in sound. Verses start halfway through songs; performances feel glaringly first-take; solos explode without precedence or warning, like a joke told out of context. Despite having two guitar players at the time, there are several minutes on <i>Libertine</i> where nobody is playing guitar at all. What were they doing instead? Low-key Montanans that they were, Silkworm never saw fit to explain their choices, if they were even choices to begin with. </p>
<p>Some bands thrive on confronting their audiences, others on comforting or reassuring them. Silkworm did neither. Their songs are stoic without being standoffish and good-natured without ever seeming eager to please. ""Couldn't you wait?/ You were funny to a fault/ Went too heavy on the salt,"" Midyett sings on ""Couldn't You Wait"", a portrait of someone whose deepest flaw is their need to be liked. For a band whose music often sounded spare and turned-down, Silkworm never seemed depressing so much as allergic to sentiment entirely.  </p>
<p><i>Libertine</i> was their last album with Joel Phelps, who, along with Andy Cohen and Tim Midyett (formerly Midgett), was one of the band's principal songwriters. As a writer, Phelps is more emotionally determined than his bandmates, who tend to keep things closer to the vest. Hearing songs like ""A Tunnel"" next to ""Couldn't You Wait"" is like juxtaposing a bare-all diary entry with a found photograph: Both are intimate, but only one retains the kind of mystery that brings you back to it a second and third time.</p>
<p>Like a lot of Silkworm's catalog, <i>Libertine </i>is a series of unconventional decisions made with conventional tools. I don't like all the music on it, but am inspired by their commitment to avoiding the obvious. Over the course of the 1990s, they toured with Pavement at the height of their powers, bouncing from El Recordo Records to the indie evergreen Matador to Touch &amp; Go, shaping their sound into something more linear and familiar—more redolent of their Cheap Trick influences than their post-punk ones. But even their later albums have a bite and opacity to them that kept the band at the fringes, beloved by few but ignored by most. My entrée into them was <i>Lifestyle</i>, which I bought in 2000 during my freshman year in college on the blind recommendation of a friend who said Silkworm was a great band. It had just come out. When my friend and I listened to it, he decided that the songs I liked were corny, and I decided that the ones he liked were cold. Both of us had a point. </p>
<p>In some ways, the band's music was overshadowed by the story of why they stopped making it, when in mid-2005 a suicidal woman crashed her convertible into the back of a car stopped at a light in Skokie, Illinois, killing three people, including Michael Dahlquist, their drummer. Neither Cohen nor Midyett seriously considered continuing. </p>
<p><i>Libertine</i> comes reissued and remastered with bonus material that includes the band's session with Seattle DJ Marco Collins in 1995, which is a nice opportunity to hear Andy Cohen play an even longer guitar solo on <i>Libertine</i>'s ""Grotto of Miracles"", though my guess is that most people interested in hearing this album will be divided into two camps: Longtime Silkworm fans who already know this material, and people who have never heard Silkworm at all. For both, there's a documentary about the band called <a href=""http://buy.couldntyouwait.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Couldn't You Wait?</i></a>, released last year. It moves at a decent pace, without too much drama, chasing moments of indifference with flashes of tenderness, portraying a group of musicians in a way that feels nuanced but unpretentious—not unlike a Silkworm song.</p></div>"|19260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19260-silkworm-libertine/|7.0|Mike Powell

The movement's power to shock came from its willing embrace of an oblivion-lust that most people shoved in the back of their subconscious. The flipside to these self-destructive tendencies was a generative urge that punks in their quest to offend usually kept under wraps, and which often expressed itself an affinity for reggae. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's easy to understand why punks would admire reggae artists: around the time of UK punk's first emergence they were at the peak of their influence, apocalyptically revolutionary and so passionate for deconstruction that, on dub plates, the songs often seemed to dismantle themselves from the inside out. But unlike punk, reggae had an ultimately utopian vision of burning down Babylon so that Zion could rise in the ashes, and the radically new sounds that reggae artists were generating was a crucial part of that vision. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So after UK punk’s first wave had crashed, the participants who were smart enough to realize the limited confines of the genre had turned to reggae for inspiration. Adrian Sherwood, a dub scene honcho who’d eventually go on to play an influential role in the industrial movement, assembled some of the more committed of them that had established themselves in the burgeoning post-punk scene—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">the Slits</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9350-ari-up"">Ari Up</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd"">Public Image Ltd.</a>’s Keith Levene, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group"">the Pop Group</a>’s Bruce Smith—into a revolving-door dub group called the New Age Steppers that released a handful of records together in the early '80s, as well as one in 2012. For 1981's <i>Threat to Creation</i>, Sherwood took his ambition (and his svengali-like tendencies) up a notch by combining that collective with another one that recorded for his weighty On-U Sound label, Creation Rebel, which had started its existence as the backing group for mystical dub pioneer Prince Far I. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The record that came out of their meeting is astoundingly heavy. Details about the genesis of <i>Threat to Creation</i> are sparse, and the meager liner notes provided by Mexican Summer’s new archival imprint, Anthology Recordings, don't help; the liners do list three drummers and three bassists, which speaks to how <i>Threat to Creation </i>is centrally focused on rhythm. Sherwood was in legitimate competition with dub pioneers like Lee “Scratch” Perry to produce the most earth-tremblingly massive drum/bass combos, and the record presents those instruments with little else to provide long periods of uninterrupted low-end bliss. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The way Sherwood chopped up, processed, and reassembled Creation Rebel and New Age Steppers’ rhythmic components hints at the more extreme cut-and-paste techniques that dance music and hip-hop would acquire after samplers came on the market a few years later. Other elements on <i>Threat to Creation</i> were treated even more radically, diced and delayed to near-total abstraction. Here and there you can identify particular sounds, like Ari Up’s quirkily dissonant piano lines and bits of skritchy, treble-blasted guitar; other sounds are more mysterious, like the wobbly tones that bubble up in the mix and a sound cluster on the title track that’s been run enough flanger to make the original signal impossible to pick out. Sherwood takes particular pleasure in experimenting with the human voice: a wordless vocal part drenched in sharp echo on the title track suggests both preverbal primitivism and technological advancement at the same time, while “Eugenic Device” reduces the singer’s role to an aching groan.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Just how far out Sherwood and his crew got on <i>Threat to Creation</i> becomes clearer when they start messing around with other people’s songs. The twitchy, paranoid “Last Sane Dream”, the album’s most post-punk-indebted cut, is a take on “Devious Woman” by reggae crooner Bim Sherman, while the snippets of vocal melody that come in during the very last seconds of the apocalyptic “Ethos Design” reveal that the tune’s a radically reworked version of the Abyssinians roots reggae hymn “Satta Massagana”. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If dub was a competition to see who could do the most berzerk things to musical recordings and still have them scan as music, Sherwood’s work set a new standard, so it’s hard to believe that <i>Threat to Creation</i> has been relegated to esoteric status. (This is the first time the record's been officially released in the U.S.) Despite its obscurity, <i>Threat to Creation</i> is an important record, and not just for the historical value of the post-punk supergroup that came together to make it, or the fact that the record carries roots in Sherwood’s future ventures in electronic music. It’s a sublime listening experience and a profound statement about the power of experimentation, and over twenty years after the fact it still sounds shockingly new.</span></p></div>"|19299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19299-creation-rebel-new-age-steppers-threat-to-creation/|8.0|Miles Raymer

But Harms’ music, a psychedelic pound that sounds as much like noise, metal, and rock as it does dance, is fascinating whether or not you’re aware of his unique method.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Waiting for Surfin’ Bird</i>, </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">the first release on which Harms uses conventional electronic instruments such as synths and sequencers, <span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is proof that his magic isn’t dependent on his tools</span>. Despite the shift, Harms’ beats still hammer away as gritty fuzz piles up around them, and he’s still obsessed with grinding a single rhythm into your skull like a trepanner’s drill, until it produces the kind of epiphanies intended by mantras. In other words, it still sounds like Harms is DJing for a dancefloor in his head, with the bouncing bodies replaced by firing neurons.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">If there’s a noticeable difference between </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Waiting for Surfin’ Bird </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">and previous Mincemeat or Tenspeed records, it’s that the music is slightly clearer now, a little sharper, more spacious. But this could just as easily be due to recording techniques as instrumentation. Either way, the variance doesn’t detract an iota from the roller-coaster thrill of Harms’ sonic journeys. He acknowledges the change himself immediately and self-deprecatingly, titling the opening track “Normal Techno Jam”. This music isn't exactly abnormal-sounding, but the frenzied, warped edge Harms gives to every sound makes it singularly demented, and exhilaratingly fun.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Despite working within minimalist structures, Harms makes everything sound unpredictably deranged, which gives the album variety. Each track features a sturdy beat that rarely wavers in terms of BPM, deriving momentum instead through texture and volume. So while the frantic “Spirou” might sound like a drum machine that won’t turn off, it also cycles through a wealth of timbral changes, timed with a precision that belies its rough, bleeding cacophony. This also means that more restrained tracks still brim with tension. “Scarfin' Boards” is probably the most reserved Mincemeat or Tenspeed piece to date, yet its tiny clicks and submerged rumbles feel ready to snap at any moment.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It might’ve been easy for Harms to give up on that formula, and stop putting so much work and energy into his music. After his excellent 2010 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13777-strange-gods/""><i>Strange Gods </i></a>on <a href=""http://zum.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zum</a>, he ended up releasing <a href=""http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Mincemeat_or_Tenspeed/The_Tower_1103/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his last record </a>for free via the <a href=""http://freemusicarchive.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Free Music Archive</a>. But he’s since found another sympathetic label to support him: <a href=""http://decoherencerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Decoherence</a>, whose owner MP Lockwood himself makes noisy beat-oriented music as <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/radioshock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radio Shock</a>. Which is fortunate, because it’s tough to imagine the music of Mincemeat or Tenspeed actually stopping. There’s a drive to Harms’ repetitive beats that feels infinite, even eternal, and so <i>Waiting for Surfin’ Bird </i>will likely echo in your brain long after the album is over.</p></div>"|19307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19307-mincemeat-or-tenspeed-waiting-for-surfin-bird/|7.6|Marc Masters

She was playing secret shows and debuting new material under increasingly inventive, singer-songwriterly pseudonyms: <a href=""http://www.songkick.com/artists/6757544-devonte-hynes-blood-orange-creep-men-kimsin-kreft-surprise-special-guest-and-hosted-by-amanda-leigh-dunn-plus-dj-set-by-becka-diamond"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kimsin Kreft</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=10234151"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Theora Vorbis</a> (an A/V pun), and most fancifully, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32111-ramona-lisa/"">Ramona Lisa</a>, the name under which she’s presented her solo debut, <i>Arcadia</i>. Chairlift’s sophomore LP, 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16183-something/""><i>Something</i></a>, possessed some excellent singles, and the Polachek-written “No Angel” ended up on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>'s recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/"">self-titled album</a>, but despite all this upward momentum, <i>Arcadia</i> is a quiet curiosity, a quirky side project that’s mostly a labor of love.</p>
<p><i>Arcadia</i> was composed and recorded entirely on tour and on laptop with MIDI instruments, but the music’s not <i>too </i>recognizably lo-fi or idiosyncratic, especially when compared to some of Chairlift’s past work. There are reprises and recurring motifs that lend <i>Arcadia</i> a conceptual coherence, but Polachek’s songwriting is as broad as it is pared-down. The record works in two modes: for more abstract material like “Hissing Pipes at Dawn (They're Playing Our Song)”, which is, yes, a impressionistic sound-painting of hissing pipes at dawn, there are tracks like “Lady’s Got Gills” and “Backwards and Upwards,” which resemble Chairlift album cuts that were allowed to melt around their chorus sections.</p>
<p>Despite their meandering tendencies, the songs on <i>Arcadia</i> sound neither tossed-off nor incomplete, and are surprisingly sticky at times. “Backwards and Upwards” is a driftier sequel to <i>Something</i>’s “I Belong in Your Arms” as an insistent organ hook and bass burble are paired with love-dazed vocals; “Lady’s Got Gills” is as playful as its title suggests, its synthesized instruments scattered through the busy beat like stones.  These moments are where Polachek’s sense of humor comes through: “Getaway Ride” is a charming bit about arson and fanciful theft, and you can hear little deadpan nudges and winks in Polachek's delivery. <i>Arcadia</i>'s introspective cuts are mostly effective as well, particularly the pastel waltz “Dominic,” which comes and goes as drowsily as the “perfect disaster” of a fling described in the song. Like much of <i>Arcadia</i>, ""Dominic"" is “pastoral” in the sense that it uses nature—fields, pale mornings-after—as an incidental backdrop for stories that tend toward the small and personal.</p>
<p><i>Arcadia </i>tends to lean instrumental and abstract, interspersed with field recordings that were inspired by Polachek’s <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/on-the-record-away-she-goes/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;ref=t-magazine&amp;_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">traveling through Rome</a> and wanting to recreate what she saw out the windows. The results are warm and almost meditative: synth pads that evoke sunbeams, choral multitracking that sounds like <a href=""http://www.midi.org/techspecs/gm.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">General MIDI</a> voice patches. There are referents for this, some expected and some not; Polachek is an avowed fan of cult singer-songwriter Virginia Astley—specifically, of <i>Hope in a Darkened Heart</i>, her collaboration with Japan’s David Sylvian and Ryuichi Sakamoto—as well as Japanese artist <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLcXo3Kse9M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mishio Ogawa</a>, and their watercolor art-pop is a clear, audible influence.</p>
<p>But <i>Arcadia </i>evokes other artists' work, too, from ambitious composers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a> or Lucrecia Dalt, to more workaday ambient artists like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYgXOLdrB8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sleepthief</a> in his less trip-hop moments, to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSDzb3yHfeI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Miriam Stockley</a> (who coincidentally has her own “Arcadia”), to any number of bedroom-produced singer/songwriters. The album is an interesting, almost peculiarly personal mix of sounds, one that almost seems underdeveloped and unlikely to win Polachek any new fans. As an outlet for Polachek’s songwriting, though, it suggests there's more interesting work yet to come from her.</p></div>"|19287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19287-ramona-lisa-arcadia/|6.8|Katherine St. Asaph

Towering at nearly six feet, with an obsidian skin tone and facial features like flint rather than flesh, Grace Jones and her androgynous looks made her a sensation in the fashion world. She stalked the runways for Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo Takada, roomed with Jessica Lange and Jerry Hall, served as muse for photographers like Helmut Newton and appeared on the covers of <i>Elle</i> and <i>Vogue</i>.</p>
<p>Fashion world conquered, Jones then returned to NYC, habituated Studio 54 (sometimes in nothing more than <a href=""http://www.djhistory.com/features/boogie-wonderland"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her birthday suit</a>), and conquered disco, recording three albums with the man who invented the very notion of the form, <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/tom-moulton"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tom Moulton</a>. Jones’ choice of covers on those albums ran the gamut from dreck like “Send in the Clowns” to a stunning rendition of Edith Piaf’s “<a href=""http://youtu.be/cCQfH0lx_DU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Vie En Rose</a>,” her flat monotone speak-singing voice atop a flamboyant overly-dramatic backdrop that veered often into camp. When the disco backlash began in earnest, Jones set her sights on a new realm to conquer: new wave.</p>
<p>In 1980, Grace Jones decamped to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas where she worked with producers Alex Sadkin and Island Records’ president Chris Blackwell, as well as a crack team of session musicians rooted by the rhythmic reggae force of Sly &amp; Robbie. (This group would eventually be dubbed Compass Point All Stars, supplying island grooves for everyone from Robert Palmer to Tom Tom Club to Black Uhuru.) Across three critical and commercial hit albums spanning from 1980’s <i>Warm Leatherette</i> through 1982’s <i>Living My Life</i> --with the expanded reissue of 1981’s <i>Nightclubbing</i> as her pinnacle-- Jones reinvented herself, while also altering the face of modern pop.</p>
<p>Fashion, art, and music all converged in the form of Mrs. Jones and looking out at the 21<sup>st</sup> century musical landscape, it’s easy to see her influence: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"">Lady Gaga</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>, and more. Beyond that, there’s an entire subset of alternative music that draws on the template set by Jones and her Nassau backing band: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/"">Gorillaz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a> all emulate those rubbery yet taut grooves of Sly &amp; Robbie and cohorts, a hybrid that amalgamated rock, funk, post-punk, pop and reggae. So curiously strong was Grace Jones’s influence on pop culture of the early '80s that not only did she pioneer the androgynous look in fashion (as styled by Jones’s then-beau Jean-Paul Goude), she was even able to turn <a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/pin/117656608986508451/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her chiseled bodyguard boy toy into an action star</a>. It's but one of many examples of Jones' singular existence in pop culture (who else nearing retirement age could command a stage with the likes of both Lil’ Kim and Luciano Pavarotti, or <a href=""http://youtu.be/mNAG-oj4PWk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">perform for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee while hula-hooping</a>?).</p>
<p>On the album’s opener, a cover of Flash and the Pan’s “Walking in the Rain”, Jones growls in her contralto about “Feeling like a woman/ Looking like a man.” Noirish, foreboding, sounding rain-slicked, the beat crafted by Sly Dunbar with percussionist Uzziah (Sticky) Thompson is undeniable across its four minutes. But it’s on the second disc, where many of the album tracks' running times are extended towards the sublime, that the now seven-minute song soars even higher. It also doubles as a showcase for keyboard wizard and the Nassau band’s secret weapon, Wally Badarou, a classically-trained synth session man who’s C.V. includes M’s “Pop Music” and Level 42’s “Something About You.” Badarou's extended solo evokes a tone not unlike Miles Davis' muted trumpet: gorgeous, weightless, it's as brooding and wistful as a midnight walk in the rain can be. On Grace Jones’s take on the tango “I’ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango),” Badarou mimics both Argentinean tango master Astor Piazzolla’s bandoneon and that eerie organ tone of <a href=""http://youtu.be/0S13mP_pfEc?t=1m9s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Runaway”</a>.</p>
<p>But of course, Grace Jones is the star here. Five of the original album’s nine songs are covers, though rather than fealty to the source material, Jones sounds as if she’s shredding the songbook with her bare teeth. She treats each cover not as a singer tackling a song, but as an actor inhabiting the skin of a role. She sneers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7099-the-police/"">the Police</a>’s “Demolition Man” as if she's a villainess leveling a hospital, inverting the gender and notions of sexual dominance in her lascivious take on Bill Withers’ “Use Me.” Dubbing out the zombiefied pacing of “Nightclubbing”, Jones intones <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"">Iggy Pop</a>’s lines with the detachment of a dominatrix contemplating her cat o’nine tails, while a previously unreleased cover of Tubeway Army’s “Me! I Disconnect From You” sets it in a sleek reggae setting.</p>
<p>Another bonus track is labeled “Peanut Butter,” which some disco fans will recognize as the title of another Sly &amp; Robbie &amp; Wally track (as remixed by Larry Levan), made for Gwen Guthrie on her 1985 mini-album <i>Padlock</i>. But here, “Peanut Butter” is the beat that Grace Jones turned into her Top 10 single and Paradise Garage anthem, “Pull Up to the Bumper.” Originally deemed “too R&amp;B” by Chris Blackwell, Jones finally got her hands on the pistoning riddim and turned it into one of the most profane singles in pop/dance music history. Long black limousines, commands to “pull up” and coos of “let me lubricate it” make it one of the finest parallel parking metaphors for butt-fucking. At a time wherein <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantic_(song)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a song about a ""gigantic"" interracial lover</a> can soundtrack <a href=""http://youtu.be/KFXwyi85gMA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a tech giant's new promotional ad campaign</a>, one hopes that soon a car company will do the same for Grace Jones' most wanton pop moment on a record that further cemented her iconic status in pop culture.</p></div>"|19222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19222-grace-jones-nightclubbing-deluxe-edition/|9.0|Andy Beta

But Runge's music possesses an unnerving sense of man-machine fusion that sends viscera burbling out your speakers—the kind of glitched-out muck that leaves a permanent stain on everything in hearable radius and makes one thankful that you can't actually smell music. It's gruesomely tactile, dank stuff, the kind of keyboard gut-ripping that primarily resembles grime in the ""Crime scene clean-up"" sense of the word.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Two years ago, Runge put out the </span><i>Unknown Vectors</i><span> EP, which took the more abrasive qualities of grime and bass music, sharpened their edges to the border of discomfort, and kicked their surefooted steps out from beneath them to leave their rhythms scrambling. Since then, he's only pushed that discomfort further, something that his new LP </span><i>That's Harakiri </i><span>brings to deeper fruition. There's some real agitation on this thing—beats that rattle like a loose drive belt, ambient percussion that sounds sourced from the static left after Earth's last radio transmission, gurgling drones on some <a href=""http://r33b.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""all glory to the Hypnotoad""</a> shit—and there's no real accessible way into it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The sick stuff's enough to shake off the unwary, and the opening one-two of ""Peace"" and ""Great God Pan"" put the most difficult aspects of Runge's music right up front. The former's a scrambled broadcast that pits trebly squeaks of inside-out digital strings against heaving meat-slab synth, resembling less a beat than a creeping caustic ooze. The latter track throws out the pastoral flute-tootling its title might imply in favor of glo-fi catatonia; there's analog hisses that give off enough neon heat to leave blisters, while a machine shop's worth of misfiring pistons plays percussion. While there are signs of order to grab on to—the straightforward 808 boom-clap beat that marches through closer ""Percressing,"" or the batterram 4/4 kicks that churn through the loud-yet-minimalist ""Remote Heaven""—the sense of short-circuit disorder is never far away, which gives </span><i>That's Harakiri </i><span>the feel of pulling order through chaos. Noise interference is ramped up, as are counterintuitive rhythms and ugly chords, only to tie them all together into an unexpected sort of cohesion. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The mutated-grime signifiers give his songs a bit of grounding; there are these juddering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4645-wiley/"">Wiley</a>-style Eski beats and bleeps in ""I Don't"" and ""You Were Wrong"" that move a little funny because they've lost a few toes to frostbite. And the pulse really does get insistently catchy once you've given in to the havoc: for all the moaning buzzes and Tesla-coil sparks that scorch its surface, ""Meshes"" also has a remarkably supple and intricate chattering beat down beneath that could goe toe-to-toe with your favorite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"">Major Lazer</a> cut for ass-shaking potential. There's a sense here that Runge is reacting to the clockwork sleekness and futurist warmth of Grime 2.0 and <a href=""http://nightslugs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night Slugs</a>/<a href=""http://fadetomind.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fade to Mind</a> bass music with deliberate violence—not out of hostility, just a fascination with what happens when all those parts start malfunctioning. In the case of </span><i>That's Harakiri</i><span>, that malfunction just turns out to be another kind of fine working order.</span></p></div>"|19303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19303-sd-laika-thats-harakari/|7.1|Nate Patrin

His debut, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14999-behold-the-spirit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Behold the Spirit</i></a>, was a workbook’s worth of tricky exercises in rapid-fire fingerpicking, cluttered harmonies, and expansive open tunings. With the help of song titles like “Terrace of the Leper King” and “The Cult of the Peacock Angel”, the comparisons to John Fahey rolled in. On his follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17780-william-tyler-impossible-truth/"" target=""_blank""><i>Impossible Truth</i></a>, Tyler rebelled modestly against that designation, peppering the album with bristlier psych-Americana pieces for electric guitar and drones. Now, across <i>Lost Colony</i>’s three tracks, the guitarist seeks to capture a completely different musical atmosphere: that of a standard-issue rock band playing live in a room.</p>
<p>The main attraction on the EP is the first track, the 13-minute “Whole New Dude"". It's essentially two movements punctuated by a recurring string of overdriven electric guitar chords which conjure up the image of hurtling towards a Midwestern skyline on an open, mildly potholed highway. The interest of the track is mostly in the changing rhythmic emphases of Tyler’s finger-picking against Jamin Orrall’s unwavering, muscular drumbeat. Tyler switches between a few basic riffs, which he plays in a cyclical progression like a regimented Indian raga. Though it’s extraordinarily involved playing, the band runs the arrangement down like they do it a few times every day, and the ritualistic nature of their performance gives the song a compellingly static, meditative quality.</p>
<p>The EP’s second track, “We Can't Go Home Again”, is also on <i>Impossible Truth. </i>There, it's an acoustic guitar solo redolent of the English folk scene of the late 1960s/early 1970s, building in intensity as Tyler adds increasingly detailed ornamentations and internal melodies. <i>Lost Colony</i>’s full-band retake sounds more like a jangly Big Star instrumental augmented by steel guitar swells. It's easy to see why Tyler decided that this version was worth a separate release—the arrangement transforms the character of the song entirely, but it also doesn’t add anything to it. Instead, the full-throttle treatment obscures some of the finer points of the guitar playing and reduces the piece’s dynamic range. If the original was a beacon of clarity after <i>Impossible Truth</i>’s comparatively sludgy first half, it feels inconsequential on <i>Lost Colony</i>, an intermission between two pieces with more inventive musical aims.</p>
<p>The second of these is an odd, playful cover of “Karusell”, a model kraut-shuffle from Neu! founder Michael Rother’s 1977 album <i>Flammende Herzen</i>. The appeal of Rother’s original is its compressed, streamlined flatness—the modesty of the grainy synth, lightly chugging rhythm guitar, and dry, muted drumkit. But the ornate details count in Tyler's version. The ping-ponging delay and fuzz on the guitar build up until the band fades out still blaring, the ""carousel"" spinning out of control in a way that the original never does.</p>
<p>On the whole, Tyler’s move toward a full ensemble feels inspired. It is gratifying to see such a gifted artist broadening his palette to accommodate new influences. If <i>Lost Colony</i> is a testing ground for ideas for a new full-length ensemble effort, it's an auspicious beginning. But it remains to be seen whether an entire album of kraut-country—Tyler has hinted at the idea—or even a record without solo guitar will play to his well-tested strengths for subtlety and complexity. </p></div>"|19294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19294-william-tyler-lost-colony/|7.3|Winston Cook-Wilson

Through the 1990s, with the brooding folk-rock act 16 Horsepower, and with the stoic solo reflections of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19544-wovenhand/"">Wovenhand</a> over the last decade, he’s bounced among various American imprints—from the majors in the mid-’90s to weirdo outpost Alternative Tentacles, from the once-edgy and now-erstwhile Jetset to the Christian encampment Sounds Familyre. The movement stems, at least in part, from Edwards’ deliberate genre aggregation. Throughout his career, he’s mixed gospel and bluegrass, rocking both punk and gothic on a forever-sliding scale.</p>
<p>The most challenging element about Edwards’ place within the industry and with his potential audience, however, is his Christianity, which anchors the music he makes. His fire-and-brimstone religion, cast often in a King James Version non-vernacular, examines his faith and the way it can survive in a world of human error. It’s neither the cute stuff of former labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13755-danielson"">Danielson</a>, nor does it possess the path-affirming promises of contemporary gospel; it’s brooding, soul-scraping stuff, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5841-michael-gira/"">Michael Gira</a> attempting to turn the other cheek.  </p>
<p>Given the consistent religious content of Edwards’ music, you might find it surprising that Wovenhand’s seventh album, <i>Refractory Obdurate</i>, arrives under the aegis of Deathwish, the label co-founded by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a> frontman Jacob Bannon. Deathwish has been a diverse label for more than a decade, releasing the aberrant punk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31337-integrity/"">Integrity</a>, the electronic creep of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave"">Cold Cave</a>, and the fetching post-hardcore of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31567-touche-amore/"">Touché Amoré</a>. Now, Christian neo-folk, sung in a loamy baritone by a 46-year-old from Colorado's found a home on the label as well.</p>
<p><i>Refractory Obdurate </i>is Edwards’ “heavy record”, with tumescent electric guitars and unforgiving drums, howled lines and massive codas. The album finally makes good on the post-punk and metal influences that have forever lingered at the edges of Wovenhand’s output. “Field of Hedon” lashes open like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> in their concision-focused heyday. The remarkable anthem “Good Shepherd” feels like pop-punk, simply slowed and strengthen by the import of its own <i>in excelsis </i>proclamation. The saturated guitars that open “Hiss” even form a black metal feint. These fortified settings afford Edwards an urgency that his songs haven’t had in a decade. “This darkness does not want me/ It refuses to hold me,” he offers during the chorus of “Masonic Youth,” the newfound electricity actually dispatching with despair. It’s primal and powerful music, loaded and loud enough to demand that you—Christian or no—at least consider his case.  </p>
<p>Edwards’ religion isn’t just central to the music he makes; in many respects, his religion—or at least his very cerebral and personal exploration of it—<i>is</i> the music he makes. “That’s the lens through which I see everything. It’s not something I just use to use,”<a href=""http://www.westword.com/2011-01-13/music/wovenhand-january-15-marquis-theater/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> he told his hometown newspaper four years ago.</a> “I don’t know anything else.” His lyrics are lined with deep-reading references to scripture and the history that surrounds it; these 10 new tracks, for instance, mention the contested temptress Salome, use an euphemism for Satan to crack a joke, and speak of travelers from ancient Biblical lands as though they’re a stranger you’ve just met on the street.</p>
<p>Faith frames Edwards’ quest for justice and redemption, too, ideals he sees distorted by non-believers and self-proclaimed Christians alike. <i>Refractory Obdurate</i> often reads like an attempt to find and defend righteousness in a landscape that he believes is deadest on destroying it, and Edwards delivers all this with Pentecostal conviction, his voice decisive and stentorian, like a preacher gathering converts at a small-town, big-tent revival. Above the searing guitars of “King David,” he yells “Have you not read the story?” He pauses midsentence, a minister taking a moment to glare at and tacitly question ever member of his gathered congregation.</p>
<p>But <i>Refractory Obdurate </i>feels bigger than any belief system. In fact, despite its name, which essentially pairs two synonyms for the word stubborn, there is a remarkable, underlying plasticity at work here. Edwards backs the nascent electric surges with the same polyglot approach he’s embraced for two decades. “Obdurate Obscura” pairs Indian rhythms with Tuvan throat-singing, Arabic oud melodies and a smoldering background hum. “Salome” is a tempestuous epic, with a web of a half-dozen electric guitars and crisscrossed vocals shaping a foreboding thicket of sound. But Wovenhand’s progressions suggest a well-worn stack of West African records, and the bursts of gang vocals betray an interest in the kind of old American work songs Alan Lomax collected. Edwards and his supporting trio haven’t simply plugged in and turned up; rather, they’ve simply expanded the scope and shifted the balance of everything that’s long made Wovenhand’s music interesting. In the process, the re-energized Edwards is as good as he’s been years.</p>
<p>Edwards works through these songs with archaic words such as “doth” and religious references so specific that you’ll need to set aside some research time in order to parse the lyrical pieces. But he refers to his god as benevolent and beautiful, a passive leader who only enacts vengeance upon the wicked, those who “free the guilty for a bribe.” Edwards’ music is incredibly personal, his albums real-time workshops for thinking through some of the biggest questions of his life and, really, our history. He sees a world at fault and wants to find ways to remedy it, or at least to reconcile his hopes with reality. “This landscape is a thorn, from Tubal-Cain down to me,” Edwards sings at one point, invoking the <a href=""http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-22.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Genesis character</a> often credited with forging the first instruments of war. The world is a birthright of troubles, he implies, and these songs—now given the wonderful gumption of an electric edge—are simply his ways of dealing with them.</p></div>"|19193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19193-wovenhand-refractory-obdurate/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

We're 15 years out from the cult-hit success of <i>Kaleidoscope </i>and “Caught Out There"", more than 10 years since “Milkshake” hit #3 on the Hot 100, and four years since the ahead-of-the-curve electro/house-leaning <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14439-flesh-tone/"" target=""_blank"">Flesh Tone</a> </i>left her with a one-and-done Interscope run that remains one of pop's lingering “how did <i>this </i>get overlooked?” mysteries. Every few years it seems like she's had to find a new voice <i>and</i> a new audience to go with it.</p>
<p>In that respect, even a move like getting Dave Sitek to produce your album on a label best known for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4251-amon-tobin/"" target=""_blank"">Amon Tobin</a> isn't excessively out-of-nowhere. The chameleonic nature of Kelis' voice and her versatility in sonic roles ranging from vintage Neptunes to Raphael Saadiq to David Guetta is her biggest strength, one that's sustained her throughout a career filled with unfair perceptions of her as a producer's plug-in. Sitek, meanwhile, gave Kelis the potential to fit her way into another side of her style and personality that could expand her repertoire—that of the contemporary NYC-native internationalist, the big-in-Europe star rerooted to the Harlem of her youth and reconciling it with the art-school upbringing that made her one of pop's likeliest indie-crossover candidates.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>And it should've gone so much better. <i>Food </i>shows Kelis in unusual form—ragged, raspy, somewhere between exhausted from effort and deep in reflection. It's definitely not the tough, coyly defiant, independently minded kick-in-the-ass that her top-flight vocal performances made famous, though there are still flashes of it for emphasis. At its best, there's a touch of Tina-in0'84 snarl to it, a seen-some-shit weariness that doubles back and draws on itself to reinforce her voice's strength. It brings out the sweetly nostalgic tint to super-earworm leadoff single “Jerk Ribs"", the deeper-than-deep long-distance yearning in Labi Siffre cover/Tunde Adebimpe duet “Bless the Telephone"", and the maternal lessons-learned wisdom in “Hooch” (which slyly invokes an epochal line from her ex <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a>: “Like your daddy said, the world is yours/ So let it flow naturally”). Even if it's a hard sell going to some of the hooks a few too many times—especially when they're as lyrically noncommittal as the placeholder-quality “Gimme what I want/ Gimme what I need/ I'm beggin' you please/ I'm down on my knees” refrain of “Friday Fish Fry”—it's striking to hear a voice you thought might've been familiar over the previous five albums given a new rendition.</p>
<p>If the occasional lapses in songwriting are forgivable, the backgrounding of Kelis' voice is a lot harder to overlook. That new, strange rasp of hers is subsumed under layers of Sitek studio trickery: pushed back by horn sections when it should be riffing off them, given reverb that makes her sound more blurry than ethereal, multitracked or given backup harmonies in a way that dulls the intriguing edges of her voice. Even if the “Bless the Telephone” cover isn't the most characteristic or innovative cut, it's at least the most complementary—just her, Tunde, and an acoustic guitar all meshing together in a way just as striking as her younger self careening through Pharrell's digital Tilt-a-Whirl. For most of the remainder of <i>Food</i>, she seems adrift, distantly in the middle of nowhere even as she's surrounded by orchestration on all sides.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>Sitek's smooth-Afropop and soul-adjacent palette largely lets the album down here, too. I'm not kidding when I point out that “Jerk Ribs” is as catchy a pop concoction as anything someone of the 21st Century indiesphere has done, the sort of buoyant interplay of slinky bass-percussion rapport and joyously martial brass this kind of windows-down-sunroof-open vibe demands. But the majority of the album sinks into an indistinct mellow R&amp;B feint that falls dangerously close to a soundtrack for young attractive people beaming down at smartphones during a ""Mad Men""<i> </i>ad break. It's to Kelis' boundless credit that she can make the twee screw of “Floyd” or the passive attack trip-hop of “Runnin” feel warmly human just by doing her best to overpower it—even as the music tries, and nearly succeeds, in overpowering her.</p></div>"|19285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19285-kelis-food/|6.3|Nate Patrin

I’m not positive it <i>was</i> a big deal because back then it wasn’t so easy to measure these things; you couldn’t add up YouTube plays or look on the Hype Machine or measure Facebook Likes to see how music was getting around. Instead, you pretty much had to rely on the conversations you were having and the reactions you were seeing among those people. And <i>Endless Summer</i>, an album of abstract but pretty electronic music on a label better known for releasing abstract and—well, if not ugly, then at least <i>difficult</i> electronic music—seemed to get around. It became the template for a type of record that has become familiar: the go-to album of electronic music for people who don’t necessarily listen to a lot of electronic music.</p>
<p>In the years since, Fennesz has made a lot of records (and he even reissued <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9760-endless-summer/"">Endless Summer</a></i>), but he’s only released two proper full-lengths that weren’t either collaborations or created to soundtrack another medium. Both 2004’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3036-venice/"">Venice</a></i> and 2008’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12502-black-sea/"">Black Sea</a></i> were quintessential Fennesz—heavily processed guitar, quaking drones, shoegaze-informed clouds of distortion—but they took his sound in darker directions with increased density. While the records expanded Fennesz’s sound in intriguing and satisfying ways, they never had that lightning-in-a-bottle moment of <i>Endless Summer</i>. It was a new millennium and we were just starting to understand the ability of using a laptop computer to make music sound new, and here was a record that took the wistful sounds of the California dream and refracted them through silicon. It was the sound of a moment.</p>
<p>For his new record, Fennesz has returned to both the label and the style that provided that 2001 breakthrough. Even if <i>Bécs</i> hadn’t been positioned as an <i>Endless Summer</i> sequel, the connection to the earlier work would have been clear. Rather than serving as texture, the strummed guitars play changes to accompany melodies. The drones and fractured processing are twinkly and bright, instead of dour and foreboding. Once again, Fennesz proves a master of this approach. The acoustic strumming in “Static Kings” sounds impossibly delicate and naïve next to the swirly vortex of the drone accompanying it; the deep organ pedals of “Pallas Athene” bring to mind a vast expanse that stretches to the horizon; the harshness of the distortion on the title track walks a tightrope between oceanic envelopment and repellant destruction. The closing “Paroles” brings it back full circle with possibly the most naked acoustic playing to appear on a Fennesz record, as processing seems to cling to random notes like a burr before being flicked off with the next note. The sense of composition and sound design is strong, and these tracks complement each other and make a coherent whole even if no two sound the same.</p>
<p>The relative warmth and light here gives the music a nostalgic cast, which was at the heart of what made <i>Endless Summer</i> so memorable, but <i>Bécs</i> also possesses an added layer that doesn’t necessarily work in its favor. Fennesz once illuminated the beauty of a digitally scrambled memory, but <i>Bécs</i> is a <i>memory</i> of a digitally scrambled memory. So while there’s something appealingly meta about returning to a sound that was so suggestive of experimental electronic music 13 years ago, there’s also just the <i>slightest</i> hint of surrender in the proposition. If electronic music in this vein is generally expected to push things forward, resurrecting a style from over a decade ago makes you wonder about motivation. But that’s an analytical judgement rather than an aesthetic one, because the music on <i>Bécs</i> is often gorgeous.</p></div>"|19291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19291-fennesz-becs/|7.8|Mark Richardson

Meanwhile, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27380-pink-mountaintops/"">Pink Mountaintops</a>—his assumed solo act that’s wrangled together various full bands of collaborators during the last decade—scored perfect spring treks with the top down, as McBean delivered exclamatory anthems about love, friendship and sex. But if you value your own safety, don’t listen to <i>Get Back</i>, the first Pink Mountaintops record in five years, while behind the wheel—or for that matter, while doing anything that requires specific and steady motor skills.</p>
<p>The album’s first half is consistent enough, offering a bright-eyed romp through McBean’s record collection. Opener “Ambulance City” dances in a way that's reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"">Television</a>, taut drums pushing at the backs of anxious, steely guitars, while McBean finds a path between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8663-phil-spector/"">Phil Spector</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"">Mudhoney</a> during “Through All the Worry” and dips into messy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Springsteen</a> love for “Sell Your Soul.” So the wreck, panic, and disaster set in around “North Hollywood Microwaves"", during the song's soul-torturing second half. There's a seesaw of dipping saxophone and diving guitar bouncing between a rubbery bassline and repeated strings of non-sequiturs—and then the rapping starts: “I’ve seen rows of cocks/ And it’s looking like corn/ Waving in the wind, I’ve sworn,” rhymes Annie Hardy, frontwoman of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1859-giant-drag/"">Giant Drag</a> and an occasional and unfortunate emcee.</p>
<p>She continues to shoot through a surreal sequence of images and admissions concerning “Ooey-gooey cum”—where it goes, where it comes from, how many gallons one can manage, how it gave her AIDS, how she now gets it from bears, and, of course, whether she prefers polar or black bears. “Cum talk, what the fuck?” she exclaims toward the end over John Wahl’s screaming, Zorn-style saxophone, and as a listener, it’s hard not to ask the same thing.</p>
<p>The trouble isn’t that McBean thought it best to include a rap verse on <i>Get Back</i>, or even that the only woman to appear on this album<i> </i>sets herself up as an automatic punchline. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">J Mascis</a> plays guitar on <i>Get Back</i>—can he rap about dicks, too?) And considering his inclusive stylistic approach, the rap's presence isn’t <i>that</i> surprising, really: while 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12918-outside-love/""><i>Outside Love</i></a> was a grand, romantic rock record with hooks as arching as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">the Smiths</a>', earlier Pink Mountaintops material (particularly the project’s 2004 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6566-pink-mountaintops/"">self-titled debut</a>) experimented with beat machines, oblong structures, and sudden interruptions as though playfulness were half the point of the project. Why not add a few rap verses?</p>
<p>But “North Hollywood Microwaves” epitomizes the nostalgia-based indecision that generally plagues <i>Get Back</i>. This is McBean’s aging record, where he gazes at the golden years of his youth with wanderlust. He questions how he ever made it out alive, wishes to revisit those high-flying times, and asks if modern youth locked into “computerized segregation” will end up okay, too. He posits that 1987, when he would have been a late teenager, was “The second summer of love”, referencing the joy of doing dirty deeds along the kid-cruising strip of his midsize Canadian hometown. And he praises those old pals who persevered when the mayhem went bad: “I could understand how you’d rather split than take my hand,” he sings during one of the album’s best moment, with chiming bells and clanging guitars adding electricity to the sudden solemnity.</p>
<p>The sentiments are there, but McBean essentially handles these questions by flipping through his record collection. Whether it’s the lyrical references to Eddie Cochran, the Boss, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2052-richard-hell/"">Richard Hell</a>, or the way these songs sound like his handwritten copies of tunes by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens"">the Go-Betweens</a>, Television, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8318-creedence-clearwater-revival/"">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>, and the Amboy Dukes, there’s the overwhelming sense that McBean is mining the past for comfort in the uncertain present. “North Hollywood Microwaves”, an out-of-nowhere aberration in a relatively wide-ranging oeuvre, is McBean’s admission that he’s not sure if he’s even comfortable with his own leaden nostalgia. It’s not just that the rap is bad (it’s horrible, actually)—it’s that the edgy, subversive decision spotlights the antique stitches and seams that hold <i>Get Back </i>together, both conceptually and musically.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered how <i>Get Back</i> might be different without “North Hollywood Microwaves,” or at least without its rapped appendix. Doesn’t it seem unfair, after all, that a largely enjoyable rock ’n’ roll album with 10 songs should be dismissed because of one track’s blindsiding goof? It does, and there’s little doubt that, with no “North Hollywood Microwaves”, <i>Get Back</i> would be pushed toward the safe bounds of mediocrity. But even after a long spell without much of a sound from McBean, I’m still intrigued by his work, or at least the possibilities of what he might continue to make. If <i>Get Back </i>were just yet another decent, mid-tempo rock record, which it mostly is, it would be safe to assume that McBean has told us his story and taken his music to its alternately <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHXe2QPmCS0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heaviest</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVpNE_AGcN0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most radiant</a> places.</p>
<p>But <i>Get Back</i> still finds McBean trying to tap into something risky and surprising, even if the results are the sometimes-egregious misstep of a mid-40s rock musician obsessed with the letdown of aging. Still, the adventure—bear semen notwithstanding—makes me want to stick around long enough to give McBean at least one more chance for a road trip.</p></div>"|19161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19161-pink-mountaintops-get-back/|4.9|Grayson Haver Currin

This isn’t to imply that he’s some kind of slacker; <i>Prins Thomas </i><i>III</i> is the third solo LP he’s put out since 2010, on top of the knee-high stack of singles, remixes, and DJ mixes that he’s released over the past decade. (Not to mention the couple of well-regarded albums he’s recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"" target=""_blank"">Hans-Peter Lindstrøm</a>). But the texture of his music suggests that he’s not working according to any overarching plan or formula, simply letting his creations wander where they please, without enforcing any rules to ruin the fun. Unlike the majority of artists who embrace this kind of lenient creative philosophy, his work doesn’t turn out terminally self-indulgent or a blob of undifferentiated sonic mush.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hermansen—better known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"" target=""_blank"">Prins Thomas</a>—is a prime mover in “space disco,” an amalgamation of disco, electro, krautrock, and pop that feels as casually assembled as one of his albums. Space disco is about as much goofy fun as the name suggests, and its existence is a low-key but intensely effective rebuttal to the self-seriousness that dance music has a habit of falling victim to on a predictably regular basis.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In his liner notes Hermansen insists that there’s “no space disco” on <i>III</i>, and that the album similarly has “no great concept, no specific theme, no scheme, no plan.” Pedantic space disco fans, if there are such a thing, can debate whether the music technically qualifies or not. But the style’s essential playfulness is still here, as well as the right amount of unabashedly screwy synth tones and cowbells, even if it’s overall an even more relaxed experience than most of Hermansen’s past work.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>III</i> isn’t an emphatically dancey record; it’s more like space disco’s chill-out room equivalent. Disco’s presence in the mix has been muted, or at least reined in, and in many places it’s overshadowed by ambient music, which has always hovered in the periphery of Hermansen’s influences, and which he indulges in here to an unprecedented extent. His most thorough embrace of the style comes on “Luftspeiling"", a drumless 13-minute-long synthesizer excursion that’s much more entertaining than that description suggests. It begins with a chunky major-key synth arpeggio that he layers with spacey pads and burbling, slightly acid-y leads, as well as a sprawlingly delayed looping guitar figure, returning to an unadorned arpeggio every time things cross a very low threshold of excitement. The results bring to mind Kraftwerk, but some extremely mellowed-out alternate-universe version of the group that got really into benzos and balearic music. (Even the song’s title, the Norwegian word for heat mirages, literally “air mirroring,” evokes a more blissfully psychedelic image of the Autobahn.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">But Hermansen’s split from the microgenre he’s most closely linked to isn’t as absolute as his notes suggest. The album opens with “Hans Majestet"", which boasts a burbling synth bass, a chugging drumbeat, and a sweeping melody that makes it sound like the theme song from a straight to video action movie from the VHS era. It closes 10 songs later with “Åpne Slusa”, which piles together manic high-pitched strings, clanging cowbell, bouncing sub-bass, and a house beat that could have come from the style’s earliest days. In between there’s a lot of stuff that’s just as danceable, only in a more abstract way. Hermansen hasn’t given up on the party; he’s just moved it someplace further out.</span></p></div>"|19293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19293-prins-thomas-prins-thomas-iii/|7.4|Miles Raymer

His voice itself isn’t the most attractive sound imaginable. At best it’s a utilitarian moan, a means to a purgative end. But that struggle between abuse and euphony could be, at times, unsettlingly sweet. <i>Loose Power</i>, the debut album by Trosper’s new band, Survival Knife, is not a traditional pop-rock record by anyone’s definition. But it is the closest he’s ever come to making anything remotely like one, and that overt love of the classics adds a wholesome swagger to an otherwise gnarled clutch of rock songs.</p>
<p>Trosper isn’t the only Unwound alumnus in Survival Knife. Unwound’s original drummer, Brandt Sandeno—who only appears on that group’s earliest material, recently collected as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18356-unwound-kid-is-gone/""><i>Kid Is Gone</i></a>—has rejoined Trosper, only this time partnering up on guitar. Bassist Meg Cunningham and drummer Kris Cunningham round out the roster, and it’s telling that Trosper has amassed a full quartet this time, as opposed to the gaunt trio that was Unwound. Instead of being a shambling wreck of anemic noise, <i>Loose Power</i> is a well-fed, red-blooded specimen. And a tuneful one. The unapologetically catchy choruses of “Divine Mob” and “Fell Runner” positively soar, even as the sparring riffs of Trosper and Sandeno refuse to play nice. Pouring post-punk choppiness into stomping hooks, “Gold Widow” leaves just enough room for Trosper’s newfound sneering croon. Not to mention a tangle of metallic guitar harmony that nests neatly inside a thunderous Black Sabbath vibe.</p>
<p>At seven songs, <i>Loose Power</i> seems at first glance like a brief album. But two songs, “Cut the Quick” and “Heaven Has No Eyes”, exceed eight minutes each—and it’s here that Survival Knife sinks closer toward the brooding Unwound mood of old. In particular, the sparse, dissonant jangle that opens “Cut the Quick” could have come straight out of Unwound’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19090-unwound-rat-conspiracy/""><i>Fake Train</i> or <i>New Plastic Ideas</i></a>, only here it thickens into a chugging confessional that concludes with—of all things—a distinctly Zeppelin-esque acoustic coda. “Heaven Has No Eyes”, on the other hand, doesn’t make the best use of its playing time, opting instead to limp along on a contorted prog-punk jam that takes far to long to reach its destination.</p>
<p>That jam, though, is telling. Trosper has never hid his love for vintage Black Flag—he once served time in a side project called Young Ginns—and that worship of Greg Ginn’s alternately needling and plodding hard-rock/hardcore hybrid is the subtext to almost every squealing chunk of <i>Loose Power</i>. “Roman Fever” borrows a telltale, descending lick from Black Flag’s “Drinking and Driving”; “Loose Power” overcomes Trosper’s biggest lyrical flop (“My twin towers/ Your twin towers”) by melding the cocksure conventionality of Black Flag’s most catchy and accessible album, <i>Loose Nut</i>, with the bluesy, serpentine proto-punk of the Stooges’ <i>Raw Power</i>. Summing up <i>Loose Power</i> as a shotgun marriage between Black Flag’s <i>Loose Nut</i> and the Stooges’ <i>Raw Power </i>might be way too tidy. Still, it’s hard not to. And it doesn’t detract from the fact that Trosper has found a fascinating new way forward: one that mangles then mingles his punk and classic-rock influences while melodically subverting his own accomplishments in Unwound. It ain’t exactly pretty, but it’s a little less ugly.</p></div>"|19243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19243-survival-knife-loose-power/|7.2|Jason Heller

For one, they’re not actually Montreal natives, or even Canadians—their collective passports list birthplaces as far-flung as New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, and Australia. Furthermore, their tetchy, talkative brand of art-punk makes them anomalies on a Constellation roster that, from the foundational releases of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> to current franchise players like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"" target=""_blank"">Colin Stetson</a>, has mostly favored the abstract over the elemental. But this outsider’s vantage is precisely what makes Ought’s debut album, <i>More Than Any Other Day</i>, so endearing and electrifying. It’s an anxious, distressed record to be sure—brimming with feelings of disaffection and dislocation—but it presents itself as such simply to show you how that nervous energy can be put to more positive, constructive use. </p>
<p>As legend has it, Ought came together at McGill University in 2012 during the “Printemps Erable”—i.e., the “Maple Spring,” when a push by the Quebec government to increase tuition fees across the province by 75 per cent prompted thousands of students to walk out of the classroom and into the streets for mass protests and school boycotts that lasted into the fall. For the members of Ought, it was an especially eye-opening experience, both as an immersion into Quebec’s proud tradition of civil unrest, and the celebratory, often musical form it can assume: the most enduring image of the 2012 movement is the sight of students and supporters dancing through neighbourhoods, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/25/montreal-pots-and-pans-video-bill-78_n_1546694.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">banging on pots and pans</a> in percussive protest. (A snippet of such a gathering can be heard in the dying moments of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXdF9uhVrI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mladic</a>” on Godspeed’s 2012 comeback release, <i>Allelujah! Don’t Bend, Ascend!</i>)</p>
<p>Now, <i>More Than Any Other Day</i> contains absolutely no songs about Quebecois education policy or the rising cost of living for undergrads. However, over its eight tracks, Ought strive to recapture and inspire that same sense of anarchic abandon they witnessed on the streets on Montreal in 2012. To that end, they couldn’t have chosen a more emblematic album cover—not because, as some have pointed out, its image of hands clasped in a show of solidarity bears an uncanny resemblance to <a href=""http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/sW9fuczKdco/maxresdefault.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another debut album from an idealistic rock band</a>, but because, as the liner notes reveal, that photo was found discarded atop a dumpster. Accordingly, <i>More Than Other Day</i> is Ought’s effort to ensure that the basic tenets of passion and commitment don’t get tossed aside amid a culture of instant gratification and distraction, and remind their hashtag activist generation of how it really feels to feel. This is a manifesto to write more manifestos.  </p>
<p>And as singer/guitarist Tim Beeler convincingly illustrates throughout the record, the process of reconnecting with your inner iconoclast can be more potent than any drug. In the standout, <i>Marquee Moon</i>-lit ballad <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16858-ought-habit/"" target=""_blank"">“Habit”</a>, the addiction in question is to the act of expression itself, and the liberating/empowering sensation of getting something off your chest (even if the strung-out, string-screeched coda nods to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffr0opfm6I4&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a song about a different sort of habit</a>). The almost-title-track “Today More Than Any Other Day” puts that transformative theory into even more explicit action: over a slowcore trickle, a dejected Beeler mutters the dispiriting line “we’re sinking deeper”—but then repeats those words over and over as the song accelerates until his ennui is reborn as exhilaration. And as the song hits its joyously frantic stride, even the prospect of going grocery shopping is elevated to a near-religious experience: “Today more than other day/ I am prepared/ To make the decision/ Between 2 per cent and whole milk,” Beeler shares, fully aware that the concept of choice in a late-capitalist economy is an inherently flawed one. But for him, even such small victories can provide one with the motivation to achieve much greater ones.</p>
<p>With his sardonic, conversational style and ticking-time-bomb outbursts, Beeler belongs to a lineage of brainiac-maniacs that span the likes of David Byrne and the Violent Femmes’ Gordan Gano to modern-day rant-rockers like Parquet Courts and Protomartyr. Likewise, the band’s sound encompasses myriad eras and permutations of proto- and post-punk: Velvet Underground drones (via the omnipersent hum of keyboardist Matt May), Feelies speed-jangle, daydreamy Sonic Youthian sprawl. And with the gritty grooves of “Pleasant Heart” and “Around Again”, bassist Ben Stidworthy and drummer Tim Keen display an amazingly deft, Fugazi-like facility with injecting a little funk into their punk without turning it into punk-funk.</p>
<p>But more so than any identifiable influence, <i>More Than Any Other Day</i> is ultimately defined by its unsettled, restless spirit; this is an album that treats panic attacks and adrenalized ecstasy as two sides of the same pounding heart, with its simultaneous transmissions of joy and fear, discipline and chaos, comedy and tragedy. As Beeler spells it out in the album’s thrillingly combustible closer, “Gemini”: “I retain the right to be disgusted by life/ I retain the right to be in love with everything in sight.” Though born of a highly politicized protest movement, Ought aren’t telling you what to do with your life. They just want to make sure you live it.</p></div>"|19248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19248-ought-more-than-any-other-day/|8.4|Stuart Berman

It was, however, judged on a different rubric, one where the standards were lower and yet the grading curve somehow far more strict: while most new bands are shown leniency if they aren’t exactly challenging <i>No Pocky for Kitty</i>, <i>Painful</i>, or <i>You’re Living All Over Me</i>, Yuck was in a tougher spot of competing with a superior version of themselves that no longer existed. Daniel Blumberg wrote the majority of Yuck’s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck"">self-titled debut</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50345-yuck-frontman-daniel-blumberg-leaves-band/"">when he left the band</a>, he took most of its underdog snarl, bite, and sadness with him. With that in mind, the quick turnaround for the <i>Southern Skies EP</i> is a smart bit of damage control. It’s also a weirdly risky maneuver, because it’s simply an addendum to <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i> that makes it clear, “this is Yuck now,” and the one from 2011 ain’t coming back.</p>
<p>That point is emphasized by opener “Athena”, a song which has no precedent in Yuck’s catalog. But since this is still Yuck, it has a lot of precedent from two decades prior, the sort of quasi-ballad that could sneak its way into the middle of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2842-bob-mould"">Bob Mould</a> project. Its brassy, bright acoustic strums and gelatinous shoegaze guitars waltz in a manner similar to “The Slim” without the caustic rage or “Panama City Motel” without the longing. But the lush guitar layering certainly sounds nice, and Yuck’s increasingly hi-fi production is the one thing it can claim as an improvement over their earlier iteration.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <i>Southern Skies</i> is a continuation of <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i> in establishing just how little of an impression Yuck can leave during otherwise competent songs. During the midtempo jangler “Set in Motion”, you can spend four minutes mentally ticking off college-rock reference points and finish without finding a distinguishing characteristic. That carries over to <i>Southern Skies</i>’ sole uptempo number, which coasts on a breezy fuzz riff in the manner of “Georgia” or “Get Away” without channeling either of those songs’ desperation or keening hooks. And it’s called—no joke—“Another One”. An EP of this nature should at the very least point towards Yuck’s future direction and to its credit, the closing title track shows the trio modernizing their sound. But this is only incremental progress that takes Yuck to the very beginning of the 21st century, as the full-stop, punctuated clipping during its main acoustic pattern instantly recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna"">Madonna</a>’s “Don’t Tell Me”, while its drum machine pitter-pat hearkens back to any number of peripherally related electro-alt singles.</p>
<p>Even if Yuck’s influences are some of the most commonplace in indie rock, that’s not the issue with <i>Southern Skies</i>. Hell, you can kinda sound like the Gin Blossoms or Goo Goo Dolls in 2014, and if you do it with enough passion and hooks, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16836-filthy-luck"">it can be goddamn revelatory</a>. As with <i>Glow &amp; Behold</i>, absolutely nothing sounds like it’s at stake during <i>Southern Skies</i><b>—</b>Max Bloom’s vocals, melodies, and lyrics build and resolve in the most predictable and comforting way imaginable, the way a data entry temp fills out an Excel spreadsheet without much incentive to do better than good enough. Call <i>Southern Skies</i> “workmanlike” if you will, just remember the sort of work most cubicle dwellers do nowadays and how they go about their business.</p></div>"|19289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19289-yuck-southern-skies-ep/|5.3|Ian Cohen

The first is a Sydney-based band fronted by Richard Davies that was active for a short time in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. The second is the solo project Davies launched shortly after that band broke up. The first Moles brought a uniquely fraught and cinematic sensibility to the Oceanian indie pop tradition honed by bands like the Bats and the Chills. The second Moles built psychedelic chamber-pop collages whose rich arrangements seemed perpetually at odds with the inescapable sense of isolation and bareness they evoked. This comprehensive reissue collects the complete works of both Moles, reserving one LP for each incarnation’s sole album-length release and appending the rest of the first Moles’ output on CD.</p>
<p>Notably, this is the first time that the original sequence of the Moles’ first mini-album <i>Untune the Sky</i> has been preserved for a US release. (The original CD reissue on Flydaddy offered a well-sequenced hodgepodge of album and non-album tracks.) Restored to its intended sequence, <i>Untune the Sky</i> feels like an almost uncanny portent of the great American “lo-fi” bands that would come to prominence in the years after its release. Opener “Wires” kicks off with a persistent bagpipe drone and just-out-of-tune guitar part that would be right at home on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"" target=""_blank"">Guided by Voices</a>’ <i>Alien Lanes</i>, and its just-pre-chorus build feels like the spiritual cousin of Pavement’s classic album opener “Summer Babe”. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">“Bury Me Happy,” which was wisely tapped to open the prior US reissue, could be an early Clean single right down to its near-cartoonish organ tone.</span></p>
<p>The greatest differentiator between the work of the Moles and that of their contemporaries, though, is Davies himself. As a presence, there is something deeply and beguilingly inscrutable about him, a purposeful blankness that betrays an enormous amount of weight and depth behind it, and oozes both vulnerability and vitriol when it breaks and cracks. Davies’ voice rings out plainly at what sounds like the top of his comfortable range, straining over the noise of his bandmates in a kind of frustrated half-triumph that suits these songs perfectly. “This Is a Happy Garden” and “Lonely Hearts Get What They Deserve”, two wrenching standouts from the <i>Tendrils and Paracetamol </i><span>EP, find the band learning to move with the nuances of Davies’ voice, making ample room for its most stark and unnerving moments, and elevating its subtle rises and swells.</span></p>
<p>The crown jewel of the first Moles’ catalog, and of this collection generally, may very well be the title track from the band’s final EP. “What’s The New Mary Jane” is ostensibly an attempt to write the lost Beatles song of the same name, and its roundness and rumble feel like a glorious, exaggerated misremembering of that band’s sonics. Its chorus is an almost overwhelmingly indulgent crescendo of layered vocal harmonies and swelling guitar chords. A top-notch remastering job is particularly appreciated here, but it’s frustrating that so many of the Moles’ most well-produced songs were not included on the vinyl in such a comprehensive set.</p>
<p>In the wake of recording their very best material, the first Moles traveled to the UK, recorded a Peel session, and broke up soon after learning that their manager had run off with the 900 pound fee. Davies moved to New York and, with his former bandmates’ blessing, kept the Moles name for a solo project accompanied by a small cast of supporting players. But the most immediately striking change between projects is found in the one of the few things they share: Davies’ voice The rawness and barely-contained urgency that Davies brought to the first Moles is noticeably absent from <i>Instinct</i>, replaced by a clenched and hyper-controlled style that Davies would continue to explore throughout his career. In Davies’ own words, <i>Instinct </i><span>was meant to be “a Polaroid of being far away from home,” and it is an almost uncomfortably dry and claustrophobic record. At times, Davies wraps himself up so tightly that it’s hard to take much away from these songs. But on more spacious tracks like “Cars for King's Cross”, which sounds exactly like a solitary walk through the snow, Davies successfully telegraphs a very particular and exquisite type of loneliness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In many ways, </span><i>Instinct</i><span> is best understood as a gestational version of the magnificent orchestral pop that Davies would go on to make with singer/songwriter/arranger Eric Matthews as Cardinal. Matthews, as with the first Moles at their best, was able to turn Davies’ hints into full-on flourishes, rendered on Cardinal’s beloved eponymous LP in glorious technicolor hi-fi. But the Moles—both Moles—were decidedly weirder projects, harder to put in any one aesthetic bucket. It is this very specificity that makes these records so profoundly meaningful to those who have been won over by their distinct but related charms.</span></p></div>"|19247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19247-the-moles-flashbacks-and-dream-sequences-the-story-of-the-moles/|8.0|Matt LeMay

The Memphis band's newest 10 songs don't offer a particularly significant step away from the sound they had established on their singles and 2012 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30734-ex-cult/"">self-titled debut</a>. The Memphis band still create songs with plenty of momentum, two guitars, and their lyrics generally lean ""dark"" or ""bleak."" Often, this band occupy the middle spot between hardcore (frontman Chris Shaw was in Memphis hardcore outfit Vile Nation) and arid psychedelia (à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31063-destruction-unit/"">Destruction Unit</a>).</p>
<p>But there's a shift here that makes <i>Midnight Passenger</i> a markedly superior album to their first one: The production opens up the band's sound exponentially. Nothing's remotely muffled, so the guitars jump out a little faster, and Shaw's voice is given more of a spotlight. It's an album with a well-crafted universe—Following the bruising, muscle-headed intimidation of opener ""Shattered Circle"" is ""Ties You Up"", and while it still features these prominent reverberating guitar stabs, it's a song that feels restrained. The percussion is given space, the strums are more concise, and the brief pauses lend an added punch to the contrastingly aggro chorus. It's also a song that shows how this band can take nihilistic lyrics about death, blood, and shootings and make them symbols for emotionally relatable sentiments. ""Ties You Up"" isn't about <i>literally</i> tying somebody up: ""You can't keep pretending that all your scars are mine,/ when you should be dreaming of your next disguise,"" sings Shaw. He's seemingly addressing a joiner—a person who keeps assuming false identities instead of establishing their own voice.</p>
<p>On ""Not a Threat"", they acknowledge what it means to be an outcast. ""No one's ever gonna get your mood,/ but that's not why they hate you,"" yawps Shaw. Naturally, this is stated with aggression, but this is the band empathizing with outcasts and loners. It's like a Memphis punk equivalent of X-Men comics. Ex-Cult never deliver flowery ""be proud of who you are and never give up on your dreams"" lyrics—everything's dark and tersely worded—but at least there are flashes of understanding or commiseration. That's why it feels like a missed opportunity when other songs pack empty sentiments: ""I'm the voice from the sewer,"" go the title track's seething vocals. Hollow intimidation is probably the least interesting component of <i>Midnight Passenger</i>, especially when you consider that Shaw's voice in a sewer isn't even a fraction as terrifying as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPdDdC4go6c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">demented clown Tim Curry's</a>.</p>
<p>There are stretches of the album that feel long-winded and threaten to breeze past entirely. ""Catholic Entries"" has some excellent studies in texture, like the scratch of strings which persists in the back of the song's mix. But it's a song that feels like it's in limbo and either needs to beef up the percussion even more or fully commit to heady spaciness. There's a line in the song about ""the future of nothing"", which is thematically appropriate for a more spare track, but it doesn't mean the song needs to persistently spin in place. It's all the more frustrating because it's just three songs removed from ""Sid Visions"", which offers the perfect formula for breaking that exact kind of monotony. Following a full minute of airy, haunting guitar work, which threatens to remain wispily inert, they kick into gear. The track picks up speed and volume, and when Shaw barks the words ""She's dead! She's dead!"", the album suddenly feels vital and electric. </p>
<p>On <i>Midnight Passenger, </i>Ex-Cult prove that their best results come along when they forgo the quiet in favor of something more brazen. There's a sweetness to the melody of ""Lights Out Club"" (similar in tone to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLsq8zPvloY&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees' ""No Spell""</a>), but it's cut with the occasional crusty, blurting low-end. This album has a couple murky stretches in tow, but considering they also have several satisfying experiments with texture, the missed opportunities are just hiccups between psychedelia-steeped victories.</p></div>"|19251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19251-ex-cult-midnight-passenger/|7.0|Evan Minsker

But it’s not really a debut: in the past two years, they’ve made a slew of fascinating small-run releases, all of which saw them steadily growing their sound into something both recognizable and capable of surprise. The semi-public woodshedding culminates on <i>The Honeymoon Workbook</i>, as the group pours many of the ideas and strengths they’ve developed into one continuous 41-minute suite.</p>
<p>The details behind the work are familiar: three 20-somethings using synths, pedals, and loop stations to make drifting, abstract music. The scenario makes it tempting to slot Good Willsmith in with other post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a> outfits melding noise, drone, and new age. But the distinct shape of <i>The Honeymoon Workbook</i> deserves to be assessed on its own terms. It’s a shape that derives partially from method: the group semi-composed a set using some planned cues and graphical scores, honed it during a 2013 tour, then executed it in one live recording session without any subsequent edits or multi-tracking.</p>
<p>As a result, <i>The Honeymoon Workbook</i> stirs up the space between controlled narrative and open possibility. On “&amp; my body to breath” a fuzzy pulse frames the sorts of tone waves and vocal moans that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1184-double-leopards/"">Double Leopards</a> once perfected. Reliably-rhythmic synths melt into haze on “Taking too long to text,” recalling the easy ascension of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/748-beaches-and-canyons/""><i>Beaches and Canyons</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"">Black Dice</a>. Some tropes emerge that in other hands could sound stale, like the rippling, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>-like bleep of “Now—shower put on all black”, or the dramatic voice samples sprinkled throughout. But Good Willsmith breathes new life into such familiar sounds, giving them a sense of purpose, as if every piece is completing a puzzle or unlocking a new one.</p>
<p>That drive is part of a simple, effective tactic: continual forward motion. There are no pauses on <i>The Honeymoon Workbook</i>, even though it’s presented as seven discrete tracks—a division that’s not simply convenient indexing. Each section has its own arc that builds on the previous and sets up its successor. They’re like lines in a poem, which is perhaps why their titles sound like verse fragments: “I told you to get up and it just happened”, “What you think is crazy isn’t”, “If anything happens to me, my password is Lady Lass”. The latter finds Good Willsmith at their most transcendent, turning columns of air, thatches of disembodied hums, and radio-preacher bites into a unified chorus of friendly strangers.</p>
<p>That description might sound forbidding, but one of the most impressive things about <i>The Honeymoon Workbook</i> is how welcoming, even comfortable it sounds. The group’s name—a half-joking pormanteau of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Good Will Hunting</i></a> and Will Smith—is meant as self-defense; as member Max Allison explained to me recently, “if [people] can't get past the name, they're probably not going to have patience to endure the sounds.” It’s an admirable idea, but probably an unneccesary one.

It’s a sad song but comfortable in its sadness, the kind of song that might make might you stop in a crowded bar and remember that even beautiful things come to an end. It is grand, but rumpled and a little isolated, too. It has quieter places to be. For someone who has performed in front of a crowd of 200,000 people, Damon Albarn never seems to be far from his next nap.</p>
<p>Blur has been on and off hiatus since 2003. Since then, Albarn has made 12 albums, including four with the downturned pop collage project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/"">Gorillaz</a>, who came on like an afterthought and ended up selling millions of records anyway. He has co-written <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Damon-Albarn-Michael-Nyman-Ravenous-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/1001170"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Damon-Albarn-Einar-%C3%96rn-Benediktsson-101-Reykjav%C3%ADk/release/1238692"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">film</a> soundtracks and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16585-damon-albarn-dr-dee/"">two</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12262-journey-to-the-west/"">operas</a>. He has collaborated with folk musicians in Mali and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15874-kinshasa-one-two/"">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, and with the rigorously buttoned-up English composer Michael Nyman. He has also partnered in a label called <a href=""http://www.honestjons.com/shop.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Honest Jon</a>’s that specializes in curiosities like <a href=""http://www.honestjons.com/shop.php?pid=15126"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>London is the Place for Me</i></a>, a four-volume set of Calypso, jazz, and highlife. He is your dog-eared friend who never seems to be doing much and yet gets more done than anyone.</p>
<p>All the Albarns appear on <i>Everyday Robots</i>. It is sleepy music, with the looseness of reggae and the bittersweet grace of gospel and soul. It connects the globetrotting Albarn to the fashionably moody one who sang Blur songs like ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BaZrbWKVg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Badhead</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4gxuwsiBOA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Is a Low</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNumVU9uBgo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tender</a>"", without Blur’s reluctant grandeur. Most of its songs are anchored by drum-machine heartbeats down low and plinking acoustic sounds up top, with a big warm hole in the middle. (<i>Robots</i> was produced by both Albarn and XL Recordings owner Richard Russell, who Albarn has previously worked with on Gil Scott-Heron's <i>I'm New Here</i> and Bobby Womack's <i>The Bravest Man in the Universe</i>, albums with a similarly old-soul quality.)  </p>
<p>Albarn is famous whether he cares about fame or not, but has tended to set his own name to the side. <i>Robots</i> is actually the first time an album has been credited to Damon Albarn and Damon Albarn alone. There he is on the cover, sitting in the middle of an indefinite gray space, hanging his head and smirking at some private joke, the boy who refuses to look at the camera even when it’s time for his close up.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Robots</i> relishes in alienation, and specifically in the way technology facilitates it. Cultural concerns like this are important but can feel pedantic when turned into art. Parts of <i>Robots</i>—the lyrics of “Lonely Press Play” and the title track, for example—are obvious statements made in obvious ways, right-on but one-dimensional, melancholy rendered melancholically.</p>
<p>More interesting is when Albarn manages to graze the side of his subject matter in a way that knocks it into place. <i>Robots </i>starts with a sample from the British comedian Lord Buckley talking about the explorer Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca: “They didn’t know where they was goin’ but they knew where they was wasn’t it.” Removed from its literal context the line becomes a comment about society writ large. “Mr. Tembo”, a sweet, upbeat song Albarn originally sang for a baby elephant he met in Tanzania, keeps returning to the refrain, “It’s where he is now but it wasn’t what he planned”—a reminder that unfortunate circumstances are less important than how you deal with them. The album’s best songs, “Photographs (You Are Taking Now)” and “You and Me”, mention Albarn’s hot-button topics but set them to the side, frames about other kinds of stories more than the stories themselves.  </p>
<p>Albarn has often been compared to English writers like Ray Davies but has always seemed more like Paul Simon, a heavy-hearted and moody person who nevertheless manages to bring a room together. A lot of pressure rests on an album like this but it would seem out of character for him to rise to it. <i>Robots</i> is decidedly lowercase music, more a piece of his puzzle than a picture on its own. </p></div>"|19280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19280-damon-albarn-everyday-robots/|7.0|Mike Powell

""There is more at stake than whether my feelings get hurt or not,"" <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/wye-oak-new-album-2014-guitar-interview/%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she said</a> in an interview earlier this year, addressing how fans would receive the Baltimore/Portland-based duo’s decision to replace her guitar with synthesizers. ""We've been touring in this band, making a living off of it since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15195-civilian/""><i>Civilian</i></a>, and we are very fortunate that that has been the case, but we're both very aware that it could totally go away.”</p>
<p>She had some reason to be concerned. Wye Oak has been beloved, especially since 2011's excellent <i>Civilian</i>, for the charged interplay between Wasner’s formidable axe-wielding and band mate Andy Stack’s immense, intense drumming. Up until that point, the singer had kept her love of the instrumental and structural aspects of pop and R&amp;B sequestered from her main outfit, seeking other artistic outlets in dancefloor-ready <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/flock-of-dimes/replica%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">odes to Robyn</a> as Flock of Dimes and last year’s gauzy, Mariah Carey-indebted bauble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18003-dungeonesse-dungeonesse/""><i>Dungeonesse</i></a>, the self-titled album she wrote with Baltimore-based musical polymath Jon Ehrens.</p>
<p>While Flock of Dimes had been ongoing to an extent, Wasner started Dungeonesse to escape a creative funk she had fallen into following Wye Oak’s constant touring behind <i>Civilian</i>. After Stack moved from the East Coast to Portland, she stared down another mental block, this time specifically around the guitar, before realizing she could just hang up the damn thing and make music inspired by her first musical loves as a child of the '90s. That’s when Wasner <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/wye-oak-new-album-2014-guitar-interview/%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“sort of fell to the ground in relief and excitement.”</a></p>
<p>That’s also where the album begins. After a light pitter-patter of synths like raindrops on her bedroom window, Wasner sings, “This morning, I woke up on the floor, thinking ‘I have never dreamed before.’” This chimerical quality suffuses <i>Shriek</i>, as if Wasner still can’t believe she can make the kind of music she has always loved without shunting it into a side project for fear of sacrificing Wye Oak’s identity. But don’t let the soft lighting fool you: Wasner’s bass (Stack now handles melody in addition to keys and percussion) reverberates with nearly the same tension as her six-string, fortifying songs like “The Tower” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16773-wye-oak-glory/%20"">“Glory”</a> with a stiff, funky backbone. Even though the latter’s synthesizer solo leaves something to be desired after Wye Oak’s guitar freak outs—nothing on <i>Shriek</i> sends all-over chills quite like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13219-the-knot/""><i>The Knot</i></a>’s “For Prayer” or equally bruising ""Take It In""—Wasner’s instrument carves a viscerally satisfying groove into the air.</p>
<p>Her voice also takes up more space on this record, going deeper and flitting over Stack’s melodies with such abandon it’s as if she might float away. Comparatively, her vocals on Wye Oak’s earlier material come out wispy and flat, crunched by the massive noises emitting from her guitar. Even on “Paradise”, with its familiar squalls of feedback in the background and pummeling drums, she sings more confidently and with a broader range.</p>
<p>That specific song makes me long for the old Wye Oak, actually, like thinking you see an old friend on the street that turns out to be a total stranger. Even though no band owes their audience music they don’t want to make anymore, it’s still a little sad reading Wasner in 2009 <a href=""http://laist.com/2009/09/24/meet_jenn_wasner_of_wye_oak.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talk about</a> how much she needs her guitar. “I know it’s cliche,” she said, “but I love it. I would go crazy without it.” Many fans will probably feel the same way—I doubt their new live setup will wrench me apart with the same visceral impact as their <i>Civilian</i> tour—but even the most steadfast relationships change, and it’s clear Wasner has moved on. As she should: the way she was feeling, if the next Wye Oak album were made the same as the last, it wouldn't sound as effortless, and she wouldn't sound as sure of herself. So we'll have to get used to it, and while we're at it, maybe we can enjoy ourselves as much as she did.</p></div>"|19286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19286-wye-oak-shriek/|7.2|Harley Brown

Bell's album, written entirely in Russian, evokes crowded rooms where the air is thick with unfamiliar food smells, where heated conversations you can't quite follow take place in a language you no longer quite remember.</p>
<p>A composer and singer/songwriter who joined the ranks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a> for the tour behind 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16806-swing-lo-magellan/""><i>Swing Lo Magellan</i></a>, Bell moved to Alaska from the Soviet Union when she was younger. <i>Край (Krai)</i> is a dizzy collision of her past and her present, a meeting space where the oldest sounds she knows haunt the music she makes now. The result occupies some gnarly middle ground between Russian folk song, chamber music, and avant-garde rock music.</p>
<p>The album is a stirring collection of strange, thrilling noises where it's difficult to know, exactly, what is going on at any given moment. Vibraphones and glockenspiel melt into synthesizers, and Bell's vocals dip, moan, and smear into lower registers with the help of pitch-shifting software. You can imagine you're hearing some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17847-the-knife-shaking-the-habitual/"">last album</a> in the blur, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/"">Holly Herndon</a>'s work with the sound of human breath caught in a digital blender, or an artfully curdled, Cubist take on Bell's current band.</p>
<p>Bell scored the album for a colorful menagerie of instruments; cello, mallet percussion, guitar, electric bass, and more sample and more crawl across its surface. The instruments sound suspended on some steep dunking line between past and present that Bell's located—new sounds plunge into the deep and come up old, and old sounds become freshly strange. The synth on ""Stavropol Krai"" strongly resembles a wailing clarinet; on ""Krasnoyarsk Krai"", the vibes and glockenspiel tinkle in a minor key above a throbbing cello and Bell's ghostly, pitched-down vocals. A chiming electric guitar picks up the figure the vibes were playing and carries them around, dropping them all over the surface of the music like pulverized glass.</p>
<p>Bell's voice, spread across in various octaves, plays the role of every single townsperson of every <i>krai</i> in her memory. Her multitracked vocals spread out to every corner of the mix. Many of the lyrics, translated into English, probe the feeling of being forgotten or left behind: ""God's too high for us/Moscow's far too distant,"" she laments on ""Primorsky Krai"". ""Kransnador Krai"" tells the story of a Cossack warrior riding home on an old path: ""Ancestral glory is gone/ New people are here/ Not a pleasant thought."" The ""blinking township lights"" on ""Krasnoyarsk Krai"" are, implicitly, seen from a distance—and distance is what Bell is working to close on <i>Край (Krai)</i>. Her mesmerizing, eventful, and strange album brings these remote voices close enough to feel their breath in our ears. </p></div>"|19166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19166-olga-bell-krai/|8.0|Jayson Greene

In 2003 he was releasing an abundance of music, including further volumes of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/""><i>Disintegration Loops</i></a>. This record was released in that year as well, and listening to it now, over 10 years after it originally surfaced, it feels like a natural successor to his best-known work. The mechanics behind it are similar; Basinski returned to the same source material used for <i>The Disintegration Loops</i>—a series of tape loops he’d made in the 1980s—to again discover a rich sound world in the degraded patterns that emerged.</p>
<p>Basinski was working in microscopic detail on these pieces, essentially using a method that picked at infinitesimal pieces of sound to see where they would lead him. Something that ties it to <i>The Disintegration Loops</i>, aside from the core operating principle, is the way he uses small movements to express larger feelings. If his preceding work was overwhelmingly about death, <i>Melancholia</i> sees hope approaching in its aftermath. It’s an album split into tracks, although it’s almost impossible to regard it as such, especially as it’s easy to pin a narrative on it when tiny pin-pricks of light rip through the surface in its backend.</p>
<p>This reissue of <i>Melancholia</i>, gorgeously packaged on high quality vinyl by the always interesting <a href=""http://temporaryresidence.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temporary Residence</a>, goes some way to advancing its reputation. It’s the type of record that deserves this kind of treatment in order to get the most out of it, making it easier to sink into the feelings of concern, threat, faith, and belief that are suggested as Basinski delicately plods through this world. The arcing piano motifs are reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd/"">Harold Budd</a>’s collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/""><i>The Plateaux of Mirror</i></a>—an album released in the same decade as Basinski’s source material, and one that shares its sense of dysphoria morphing into optimism.</p>
<p>Occasionally <i>Melancholia</i> drops like a lead weight, with darker transmissions emerging just as set patterns threaten to take hold. “Melancholia XIII” is the most effective of these; sequenced as the penultimate track to the album, it works as a subtle reminder of the ills in Basinski’s world, even if he does appear to be on a slow, upward trajectory during everything that surrounds the track. “Melancholia VII” is an earlier downturn in mood, highlighting how well he suggests struggle in his work—here, it feels like the ghostly loops are last gasp remnants of some dying planet, struggling to make one final broadcast before the darkness overwhelms.</p>
<p>Something this album toys with occasionally is a wistful, almost folky kind of ambience. On “Melancholia IX” Basinski gets tangled up in the kind of atmosphere that lutist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30210-jozef-van-wissem/"">Jozef Van Wissem</a> occasionally inhabits, where the sense of sadness is underpinned by a rustic air, giving it the feel of a place that’s centuries old. It’s a key reason why Basinski’s work can resonate so hard—the tools he uses may be modern, but the feeling he foments in his work is positively ancient. It makes the slow movement through <i>Melancholia</i> instantly relatable on a very human, almost primordial level, like looking at an old cave painting and realizing how much of it reflects our current identity.</p></div>"|19246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19246-william-basinski-melancholia/|7.4|Nick Neyland

His latest release, <i>Phantom Vibrate</i>, is built extra lush and cushiony, inflected with R&amp;B. But Greene has always been meticulous with his implementation of that genre into dance music. Various strands of dance music and R&amp;B <i>have</i> been fraternizing almost forever, though, whether it’s the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"" target=""_blank"">Aaliyah</a> apparitions made popular by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>’s “In McDonalds” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"" target=""_blank"">Usher</a>’s big box EDM. But in 2014, R&amp;B has become somewhat of a boutique concern in the indiesphere, despite the OGs still knocking it out of the park elsewhere. (See: Toni Braxton and Babyface’s phenomenal collaborative heart tour <i>Love, Marriage, &amp; Divorce,</i> released earlier this year.) The commingling of R&amp;B with indie has been a thing at least since Tom Krell’s bedroom-recording project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well </a>gained traction in 2010 and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a> went further on another track in 2011, and the influence hasn’t left the conversation. But few get the mix right. </p>
<p>Montreal’s Greene has always had a feel for R&amp;B, whether it’s dropping Mya’s “Ponytail” in DJ sets or wistfully reimagining Ciara’s remix of “Deuces” on his track “Another Girl”. With <i>Phantom Vibrate</i>, he’s taken his interest to a delicate new level. The EP’s opener and first single, “No Excuse”, elevates “Favorite Girl” by Marques Houston (of Immature and annoying next-door neighbor Roger from ""Sister, Sister""), with Greene taking the overwhelmingly sweet cut and flipping it into a celestial paean by way of crunchy percussion, ascendant synths, and intermittent sweeps of bells.</p>
<p>The emotional swell of “No Excuse”, the A-side, towers over the rest of the release. ""Feel What” and “Night Tracking” have a willowy, less emphatic texture than “No Excuse”, but Greene has proven to have a strong grasp on how varied house music can embody the emotional weight of R&amp;B. “Feel What” is a nimble collage of varied tempos, the vocal sample blending into the hodgepodge of skittering, revved, and staticky synths. On paper that sounds like a nightmare drafted on Ableton, but with Greene as the technician, it’s seamlessly meditative. “Night Tracking” is the closest to classic house and the EP’s quietest cut. It almost seems to fight with itself at points, different grooves trying to be the most dominant on the track, intertwining and acquiescing with tranquil aggression before zipping into silence.</p>
<p>Had “No Excuse” been the closer, it would have given the short collection a more substantial climax. Instead, the EP’s downward tonal slope plays out an emotional arc of a blossoming romance into its ultimate dissolution, down to the wielding of vocal samples. What’s clear and unruffled at the beginning becomes absent toward the end. Greene has done robust heartbreak before with last year’s ebulliently elastic “On Your Side” featuring the aforementioned How to Dress Well singing about loving desperation. Even when that song’s lonely lyrics are gutting, the beat never feels vacant. With <i>Phantom Vibrate</i>, Greene breaks it down further, separating feelings into their own parts, narrating with sound how you get from allure to familiarity to the void. </p></div>"|19292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19292-jacques-greene-phantom-vibrate-ep/|6.8|Claire Lobenfeld

Though none of the group's original albums have been reissued recently, they have never been reviewed by Pitchfork.</i></p>
<p><i>____</i></p>
<p>The great anecdote about the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> is that they formed when a college dropout going by the name Black Francis put out an ad for a female bass player who liked both the punk band Hüsker Dü and the folk trio Peter, Paul, and Mary.</p>
<p>The Venn diagram here would be tight. Hüsker Dü made noisy, bleeding-heart records for the underground label SST; Peter, Paul and Mary sang ""Puff, the Magic Dragon"". Francis got only one response, from a woman named Kim Deal. She had never played the bass before but presumably saw in his ad some sly humor and the spark of liberated thinking that lies behind a bad idea.</p>
<p>Crucially, the Pixies weren't from New York or Los Angeles, or even Chicago, but Boston: a famous place but fiercely provincial, with all the reticence of small-town New England and almost no cosmopolitan sheen. We can always depend on Boston for more sports and software engineers. Early on, Francis—a comic-book kid raised in an evangelical church—talked about the band's music with all the pretense of someone fixing toilets or laying shingle. ""You want to be different from other people, sure, so you throw in as many arbitrary things as possible,"" <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=CcNHQ-8NReEC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;lpg=PT90&amp;dq=simon+reynolds+%22pixies%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2b-_fZ-Cdl&amp;sig=k5cGetD-vX4a8GLP-NaqzRoM4E4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WplRU_SKFseHyASyr4CIBA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=pixies&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told the writer Simon Reynolds</a> shortly after their 1988 debut, <i>Surfer Rosa</i>. A few minutes later, the band's drummer, David Lovering, interrupted to describe a video he'd seen of ""people shooting eggs out of their ass, right across the room into another guy's mouth.""</p>
<p>The band's songs were about Old Testament Christianity, UFOs and white women who crave sex with big black men—fixations that in certain contexts can turn ordinary people into outcasts. Francis liked the surrealist movies of Luis Buñuel and David Lynch circa <i>Eraserhead</i>, which use violence not as a real-world dynamic but a metaphor for the roiling inner worlds we can cover up but never quite control. On a <i>Surfer Rosa</i> song called ""Cactus"", he begs a woman to cut herself up on a cactus and send him the bloody dress in the mail. For the Pixies, this passes as a ballad. In general they remain solid evidence for the theory that the darkest and most violent thinking is done by the quiet kids next door.</p>
<p>In March 1987, the band went into a warehouse studio called Fort Apache and worked for three days straight, producing 18 songs. The project cost a thousand dollars, including printing, tapes, and beer. Eight of these songs were released as <i><b>Come on Pilgrim</b></i> on 4AD, an English label that had built a reputation selling, moody, vague bands like Dead Can Dance and the Cocteau Twins but by 1987 had also released some Bulgarian choral music, the number-one dance-pop song ""Pump up the Volume"", and an album by their first American signing, the Throwing Muses. More recently, they've released albums by Deerhunter and Ariel Pink, and in general remain a safe home for uncommon art.</p>
<p><i>Pilgrim</i> is 20 minutes long and more of a hint at what the band could do than anything else. Two of its best songs (""Caribou"" and ""Vamos"") ended up being re-recorded in more muscular forms; another (""Nimrod's Son"") unfortunately wasn't. The other songs from the Fort Apache sessions—which came to be called ""The Purple Tape""—ended up scattered throughout the Pixies catalog, also in stronger versions. As much as the band changed and refined their sound over time, they seemed almost romantically attached to a big-bang concept of their own music, like a person who measures every relationship against that first love.</p>
<p><b><i>Surfer Rosa</i></b> is highly combustible music, but slapstick, too. Many of its songs feel half-finished or regurgitated in half-digested form, with verses that run on longer than they ordinarily might, choruses that repeat odd numbers of times instead of even ones, and abrupt shifts in tone and volume. Francis was less of a rock singer than a grotesque impression of one, too angry and too tender, a pantomime of extremes. He sounds new but seems to come from an old place, like an obscure bog predator with alien-looking adaptations.</p>
<p>But for all their radical ideas, the Pixies depended on convention—without it, they would have nothing to pick apart. Like Devo or Pere Ubu before them, they were an art-rock band steeped in the 1950s and early 60s, a period of music before rock was considered art. Their songs feed back to surf, boogie, doo-wop and early R&amp;B more easily than anything post-Beatles. The notion that they were changing the shape of alternative rock seemed like a nice bonus but immaterial. In an anecdote from the sessions for the band's 1988 album, <i>Doolittle</i>, Francis told producer Gil Norton that if two-minute songs were good enough for Buddy Holly, they were good enough for him.</p>
<p><b><i>Doolittle</i></b> is their most famous album and for understandable reasons. It's more even keel than <i>Surfer Rosa</i> and better mannered, too, forgoing the harsh live sound of Steve Albini for the lush, almost folksy one of Gil Norton, who had had previously worked with marshmallows like Echo and the Bunnymen. Its songs take aim at the big things important art is sometimes supposed to: good and evil, environmental ruin, Bible stories, death. ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" features some allegory about the ozone layer, which in the late 1980s had the same conversational weight and place as ""climate change""; ""Gouge Away"" flirts with Catholicism. ""Hey"" is practically their ""Like a Prayer,"" an oblique gospel anchored by the premise that we too may one day break free our earthly bonds and ascend—a trope art has worked with for much longer than rock music has been around.</p>
<p>It's in <i>Doolittle</i>'s margins—the faux-hillbilly cackling of ""Mr. Grieves,"" ""There Goes My Gun"" and ""Dead""—that the album becomes what it really is. At heart, the Pixies were a kind of American goth band, fascinated by rural violence, the intersection of lust and danger, creepy innkeepers and the sexual magnetism of strangers who wander into roadside cafés from parts unknown. Their biggest crossover single, ""Here Comes Your Man,"" is less tied to European dada than the rustic imagery of a pulp paperback: The boxcar, the nowhere plains, the big stone and the broken crown.</p>
<p>About four years ago I moved from New York to Arizona and found myself listening to the the band's last two albums—1990's <b><i>Bossanova </i></b>and 1991's <i>Trompe Le Monde</i>—a lot. It's true what they say about the desert when they say it looks like the moon. Plants and animals seem proud to have survived the odds. <i>Bossanova</i> and <i>Trompe Le Monde</i> make sense to me here, when it's 110 degrees by lunch and the concrete ripples in the heat. They're narrower in scope than <i>Doolittle</i>, and have a tough, inorganic presence, like burnished chrome. </p>
<p>But I think what keeps more people from listening to them is that they seem like albums that don't care whether you listen to them or not. <i>Bossanova</i> is sweeter than <i>Trompe</i>, but its sweetness exists at an impossible distance. ""She's my fave, undressing in the sun,"" Francis whispers on the cryptic miniature, ""Ana"". ""Return to sea—bye. Forgetting everyone."" Later, on ""Havalina,"" he spots a <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/production.mediajoint.prx.org/public/piece_images/198430/JAVELINA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">javelina</a>—an ornery, boar-like animal not uncommon here—walking across a plain. The music is a slow dance between celestial bodies, heavenly but melancholic. So he sees the boar, and in two short lines, the song is over. Late Pixies songs are triumphs of private epiphany: Small, diamond-bright moments that flash in someone's eyes and then disappear forever.</p>
<p>By <b><i>Trompe Le Monde</i></b> the band had transitioned from seeming like quiet people who liked violent movies to violent people who didn't make much time for movies at all. This is outlaw music, sharpened by conspiracy theory and too much time with too little human contact. ""I had me a vision/ There wasn't any television/ From looking into the sun,"" Francis sings on ""Distance Equals Rate Times Time"", splitting ""sun"" into two syllables as though to make sure you heard him and are duly disturbed. He still howls and screams, but had also developed a new voice, a flat, posthuman kind of monotone. <i>Trompe</i> is more aggressive than anything in their catalog but also more confident. They can handle this now, and they do.</p>
<p>Francis' allusions to Catholicism turned into overt talk about UFOs, which makes sense when you remember that religion has always just been a way to explain the lights in the sky. A kind of concept album emerges, especially toward the album's end: a song about the geography of Mars followed by a song about a burnout named Jefrey—""with one f""—sitting on a carpet with a tabla, thinking about outer space, followed by Francis staring into the sun, a gesture made out of the desperation to find new answers. </p>
<p>For however classically far out the Pixies got toward the end, they had also never sounded so grounded. The album's climax, ""Motorway to Roswell"", is half-written from the perspective of an extraterrestrial, but turns on Francis' question: ""How could this so great, turn so shitty?/ He ended up in Army crates."" Reality had never made such a decisive appearance in a Pixies song.</p>
<p>The band came together in an unusual way but broke up like anyone else: Creative differences, in-fighting, the collision of fragile egos. Francis went on to make several solo records as Frank Black, one of which is called <i>Teenager of the Year</i> and is the sound of a creative person relinquishing himself of the pressures of being in a famous band and appreciating the practice of not giving a damn. Listen to ""Speedy Marie""; listen to ""Thalassocracy"". Feel the joy and the lightness. Then return to <i>Trompe Le Monde</i> and you can hear how angry Francis had become.</p>
<p>Kim Deal moved on to focus on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>, a project with her identical twin Kelley whose albums sound like abstract slumber-party music for teenagers with comfortable access to weed. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17942-the-breeders-lsxx/""><i>Last Splash</i></a> belongs in the Library of Congress, and their subsequent albums—<i>Title TK</i> and <i>Mountain Battles</i>—remain object lessons in how bands can remain weird without ever becoming alienating. </p>
<p>After 11 years of separation, the Pixies reunited and went on tour, becoming one of a slew of 80s and 90s alternative bands lobbying for heritage status. Francis never fully reconciled with Deal, who played several of the reunion shows but opted out of recent recording sessions and has embarked on her own time-capsule show, touring <i>Last Splash </i>with the Breeders. Deal's symbolic contributions were as important as her musical ones: The cool, down-to-earth woman who defused Francis' showy angst. She had actually been fired between <i>Doolittle</i> and <i>Bossanova </i>and subsequently rehired, and on later Pixies albums appears just often enough to reminds you that she's in the band.</p>
<p>The Pixies have now been reunited for four years longer than they were around to begin with, but are just getting around to releasing a new album, which they have called <b><i>Indie Cindy</i></b>. Worse than any of the music is the feeling that a band so deft at challenging the system has become part of it in the most predictable ways, rubbing together the tropes of their old art and hoping they can still start a fire, replacing experimentation with routine, filling Kim Deal's place with not one but two different bassists over the last five months, breaking up the album into three EPs to gin up interest, and generally reminding us that artists of their stature are businesses, not charities.</p>
<p>Things start decent and peter out quick. ""What Goes Boom"", ""Greens and Blues"", ""Indie Cindy"": these are slick songs, a little overextended and puffed up, intimidated by the band's legacy but charming in their own way. But part of what made the Pixies interesting is that they always seemed to possess some unquantifiable danger, which they no longer do. Three middle-aged guys seeing what happens when they get back on the horse and try again, they now sound most comfortable when they're being laid-back, ""Greens and Blues"" and the chorus of ""Indie Cindy"" especially. The album's lows aren't so much bad as routine. ""Snakes"", ""Blue Eyed Hexe"", et cetera: these are just distractions, breadsticks.</p>
<p><i>Indie Cindy</i>'s title track is built using the template of <i>Bossanova</i>: Spacey and gorgeous, shattered and dissonant, spacey and gorgeous again. Toward the end of the song, Francis offers the line, ""As we follow the bouncing the ball/ They call this dance the washed-up crawl,"" and then, a simple plea: ""Indie Cindy, be in love with me."" Part of loving the Pixies has always been the suspicion that they were gracing us from an alien place somewhere beyond love, where sentiment was never easy or necessary. It may be the most vulnerable line Francis ever wrote.</p></div>"|19282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19282-pixies-catalogue/|8.3|Mike Powell

<p><i>____</i></p>
<p>The great anecdote about the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> is that they formed when a college dropout going by the name Black Francis put out an ad for a female bass player who liked both the punk band Hüsker Dü and the folk trio Peter, Paul, and Mary.</p>
<p>The Venn diagram here would be tight. Hüsker Dü made noisy, bleeding-heart records for the underground label SST; Peter, Paul and Mary sang ""Puff, the Magic Dragon"". Francis got only one response, from a woman named Kim Deal. She had never played the bass before but presumably saw in his ad some sly humor and the spark of liberated thinking that lies behind a bad idea.</p>
<p>Crucially, the Pixies weren't from New York or Los Angeles, or even Chicago, but Boston: a famous place but fiercely provincial, with all the reticence of small-town New England and almost no cosmopolitan sheen. We can always depend on Boston for more sports and software engineers. Early on, Francis—a comic-book kid raised in an evangelical church—talked about the band's music with all the pretense of someone fixing toilets or laying shingle. ""You want to be different from other people, sure, so you throw in as many arbitrary things as possible,"" <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=CcNHQ-8NReEC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;lpg=PT90&amp;dq=simon+reynolds+%22pixies%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2b-_fZ-Cdl&amp;sig=k5cGetD-vX4a8GLP-NaqzRoM4E4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WplRU_SKFseHyASyr4CIBA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=pixies&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told the writer Simon Reynolds</a> shortly after their 1988 debut, <i>Surfer Rosa</i>. A few minutes later, the band's drummer, David Lovering, interrupted to describe a video he'd seen of ""people shooting eggs out of their ass, right across the room into another guy's mouth.""</p>
<p>The band's songs were about Old Testament Christianity, UFOs and white women who crave sex with big black men—fixations that in certain contexts can turn ordinary people into outcasts. Francis liked the surrealist movies of Luis Buñuel and David Lynch circa <i>Eraserhead</i>, which use violence not as a real-world dynamic but a metaphor for the roiling inner worlds we can cover up but never quite control. On a <i>Surfer Rosa</i> song called ""Cactus"", he begs a woman to cut herself up on a cactus and send him the bloody dress in the mail. For the Pixies, this passes as a ballad. In general they remain solid evidence for the theory that the darkest and most violent thinking is done by the quiet kids next door.</p>

Francis was less of a rock singer than a grotesque impression of one, too angry and too tender, a pantomime of extremes. He sounds new but seems to come from an old place, like an obscure bog predator with alien-looking adaptations.</p>
<p>But for all their radical ideas, the Pixies depended on convention—without it, they would have nothing to pick apart. Like Devo or Pere Ubu before them, they were an art-rock band steeped in the 1950s and early 60s, a period of music before rock was considered art. Their songs feed back to surf, boogie, doo-wop and early R&amp;B more easily than anything post-Beatles. The notion that they were changing the shape of alternative rock seemed like a nice bonus but immaterial. In an anecdote from the sessions for the band's 1988 album, <i>Doolittle</i>, Francis told producer Gil Norton that if two-minute songs were good enough for Buddy Holly, they were good enough for him.</p>
<p><b><i>Doolittle</i></b> is their most famous album and for understandable reasons. It's more even keel than <i>Surfer Rosa</i> and better mannered, too, forgoing the harsh live sound of Steve Albini for the lush, almost folksy one of Gil Norton, who had had previously worked with marshmallows like Echo and the Bunnymen. Its songs take aim at the big things important art is sometimes supposed to: good and evil, environmental ruin, Bible stories, death. ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" features some allegory about the ozone layer, which in the late 1980s had the same conversational weight and place as ""climate change""; ""Gouge Away"" flirts with Catholicism. ""Hey"" is practically their ""Like a Prayer,"" an oblique gospel anchored by the premise that we too may one day break free our earthly bonds and ascend—a trope art has worked with for much longer than rock music has been around.</p>
<p>It's in <i>Doolittle</i>'s margins—the faux-hillbilly cackling of ""Mr. Grieves,"" ""There Goes My Gun"" and ""Dead""—that the album becomes what it really is. At heart, the Pixies were a kind of American goth band, fascinated by rural violence, the intersection of lust and danger, creepy innkeepers and the sexual magnetism of strangers who wander into roadside cafés from parts unknown. Their biggest crossover single, ""Here Comes Your Man,"" is less tied to European dada than the rustic imagery of a pulp paperback: The boxcar, the nowhere plains, the big stone and the broken crown.</p>
<p>About four years ago I moved from New York to Arizona and found myself listening to the the band's last two albums—1990's <b><i>Bossanova </i></b>and 1991's <i>Trompe Le Monde</i>—a lot. It's true what they say about the desert when they say it looks like the moon. Plants and animals seem proud to have survived the odds. <i>Bossanova</i> and <i>Trompe Le Monde</i> make sense to me here, when it's 110 degrees by lunch and the concrete ripples in the heat. They're narrower in scope than <i>Doolittle</i>, and have a tough, inorganic presence, like burnished chrome. </p>
<p>But I think what keeps more people from listening to them is that they seem like albums that don't care whether you listen to them or not. <i>Bossanova</i> is sweeter than <i>Trompe</i>, but its sweetness exists at an impossible distance. ""She's my fave, undressing in the sun,"" Francis whispers on the cryptic miniature, ""Ana"". ""Return to sea—bye. Forgetting everyone."" Later, on ""Havalina,"" he spots a <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/production.mediajoint.prx.org/public/piece_images/198430/JAVELINA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">javelina</a>—an ornery, boar-like animal not uncommon here—walking across a plain. The music is a slow dance between celestial bodies, heavenly but melancholic. So he sees the boar, and in two short lines, the song is over. Late Pixies songs are triumphs of private epiphany: Small, diamond-bright moments that flash in someone's eyes and then disappear forever.</p>
<p>By <b><i>Trompe Le Monde</i></b> the band had transitioned from seeming like quiet people who liked violent movies to violent people who didn't make much time for movies at all. This is outlaw music, sharpened by conspiracy theory and too much time with too little human contact. ""I had me a vision/ There wasn't any television/ From looking into the sun,"" Francis sings on ""Distance Equals Rate Times Time"", splitting ""sun"" into two syllables as though to make sure you heard him and are duly disturbed. He still howls and screams, but had also developed a new voice, a flat, posthuman kind of monotone. <i>Trompe</i> is more aggressive than anything in their catalog but also more confident. They can handle this now, and they do.</p>
<p>Francis' allusions to Catholicism turned into overt talk about UFOs, which makes sense when you remember that religion has always just been a way to explain the lights in the sky. A kind of concept album emerges, especially toward the album's end: a song about the geography of Mars followed by a song about a burnout named Jefrey—""with one f""—sitting on a carpet with a tabla, thinking about outer space, followed by Francis staring into the sun, a gesture made out of the desperation to find new answers. </p>
<p>For however classically far out the Pixies got toward the end, they had also never sounded so grounded. The album's climax, ""Motorway to Roswell"", is half-written from the perspective of an extraterrestrial, but turns on Francis' question: ""How could this so great, turn so shitty?/ He ended up in Army crates."" Reality had never made such a decisive appearance in a Pixies song.</p>
<p>The band came together in an unusual way but broke up like anyone else: Creative differences, in-fighting, the collision of fragile egos. Francis went on to make several solo records as Frank Black, one of which is called <i>Teenager of the Year</i> and is the sound of a creative person relinquishing himself of the pressures of being in a famous band and appreciating the practice of not giving a damn. Listen to ""Speedy Marie""; listen to ""Thalassocracy"". Feel the joy and the lightness. Then return to <i>Trompe Le Monde</i> and you can hear how angry Francis had become.</p>
<p>Kim Deal moved on to focus on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>, a project with her identical twin Kelley whose albums sound like abstract slumber-party music for teenagers with comfortable access to weed. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17942-the-breeders-lsxx/""><i>Last Splash</i></a> belongs in the Library of Congress, and their subsequent albums—<i>Title TK</i> and <i>Mountain Battles</i>—remain object lessons in how bands can remain weird without ever becoming alienating. </p>
<p>After 11 years of separation, the Pixies reunited and went on tour, becoming one of a slew of 80s and 90s alternative bands lobbying for heritage status. Francis never fully reconciled with Deal, who played several of the reunion shows but opted out of recent recording sessions and has embarked on her own time-capsule show, touring <i>Last Splash </i>with the Breeders. Deal's symbolic contributions were as important as her musical ones: The cool, down-to-earth woman who defused Francis' showy angst. She had actually been fired between <i>Doolittle</i> and <i>Bossanova </i>and subsequently rehired, and on later Pixies albums appears just often enough to reminds you that she's in the band.</p>
<p>The Pixies have now been reunited for four years longer than they were around to begin with, but are just getting around to releasing a new album, which they have called <b><i>Indie Cindy</i></b>. Worse than any of the music is the feeling that a band so deft at challenging the system has become part of it in the most predictable ways, rubbing together the tropes of their old art and hoping they can still start a fire, replacing experimentation with routine, filling Kim Deal's place with not one but two different bassists over the last five months, breaking up the album into three EPs to gin up interest, and generally reminding us that artists of their stature are businesses, not charities.</p>
<p>Things start decent and peter out quick. ""What Goes Boom"", ""Greens and Blues"", ""Indie Cindy"": these are slick songs, a little overextended and puffed up, intimidated by the band's legacy but charming in their own way. But part of what made the Pixies interesting is that they always seemed to possess some unquantifiable danger, which they no longer do. Three middle-aged guys seeing what happens when they get back on the horse and try again, they now sound most comfortable when they're being laid-back, ""Greens and Blues"" and the chorus of ""Indie Cindy"" especially. The album's lows aren't so much bad as routine. ""Snakes"", ""Blue Eyed Hexe"", et cetera: these are just distractions, breadsticks.</p>
<p><i>Indie Cindy</i>'s title track is built using the template of <i>Bossanova</i>: Spacey and gorgeous, shattered and dissonant, spacey and gorgeous again. Toward the end of the song, Francis offers the line, ""As we follow the bouncing the ball/ They call this dance the washed-up crawl,"" and then, a simple plea: ""Indie Cindy, be in love with me."" Part of loving the Pixies has always been the suspicion that they were gracing us from an alien place somewhere beyond love, where sentiment was never easy or necessary. It may be the most vulnerable line Francis ever wrote.</p></div>"|19282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19282-pixies-catalogue/|10.0|Mike Powell

<p><i>____</i></p>
<p>The great anecdote about the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> is that they formed when a college dropout going by the name Black Francis put out an ad for a female bass player who liked both the punk band Hüsker Dü and the folk trio Peter, Paul, and Mary.</p>
<p>The Venn diagram here would be tight. Hüsker Dü made noisy, bleeding-heart records for the underground label SST; Peter, Paul and Mary sang ""Puff, the Magic Dragon"". Francis got only one response, from a woman named Kim Deal. She had never played the bass before but presumably saw in his ad some sly humor and the spark of liberated thinking that lies behind a bad idea.</p>
<p>Crucially, the Pixies weren't from New York or Los Angeles, or even Chicago, but Boston: a famous place but fiercely provincial, with all the reticence of small-town New England and almost no cosmopolitan sheen. We can always depend on Boston for more sports and software engineers. Early on, Francis—a comic-book kid raised in an evangelical church—talked about the band's music with all the pretense of someone fixing toilets or laying shingle. ""You want to be different from other people, sure, so you throw in as many arbitrary things as possible,"" <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=CcNHQ-8NReEC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;lpg=PT90&amp;dq=simon+reynolds+%22pixies%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2b-_fZ-Cdl&amp;sig=k5cGetD-vX4a8GLP-NaqzRoM4E4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WplRU_SKFseHyASyr4CIBA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=pixies&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told the writer Simon Reynolds</a> shortly after their 1988 debut, <i>Surfer Rosa</i>. A few minutes later, the band's drummer, David Lovering, interrupted to describe a video he'd seen of ""people shooting eggs out of their ass, right across the room into another guy's mouth.""</p>
<p>The band's songs were about Old Testament Christianity, UFOs and white women who crave sex with big black men—fixations that in certain contexts can turn ordinary people into outcasts. Francis liked the surrealist movies of Luis Buñuel and David Lynch circa <i>Eraserhead</i>, which use violence not as a real-world dynamic but a metaphor for the roiling inner worlds we can cover up but never quite control. On a <i>Surfer Rosa</i> song called ""Cactus"", he begs a woman to cut herself up on a cactus and send him the bloody dress in the mail. For the Pixies, this passes as a ballad. In general they remain solid evidence for the theory that the darkest and most violent thinking is done by the quiet kids next door.</p>
<p>In March 1987, the band went into a warehouse studio called Fort Apache and worked for three days straight, producing 18 songs. The project cost a thousand dollars, including printing, tapes, and beer. Eight of these songs were released as <i><b>Come on Pilgrim</b></i> on 4AD, an English label that had built a reputation selling, moody, vague bands like Dead Can Dance and the Cocteau Twins but by 1987 had also released some Bulgarian choral music, the number-one dance-pop song ""Pump up the Volume"", and an album by their first American signing, the Throwing Muses. More recently, they've released albums by Deerhunter and Ariel Pink, and in general remain a safe home for uncommon art.</p>
<p><i>Pilgrim</i> is 20 minutes long and more of a hint at what the band could do than anything else. Two of its best songs (""Caribou"" and ""Vamos"") ended up being re-recorded in more muscular forms; another (""Nimrod's Son"") unfortunately wasn't. The other songs from the Fort Apache sessions—which came to be called ""The Purple Tape""—ended up scattered throughout the Pixies catalog, also in stronger versions. As much as the band changed and refined their sound over time, they seemed almost romantically attached to a big-bang concept of their own music, like a person who measures every relationship against that first love.</p>
<p><b><i>Surfer Rosa</i></b> is highly combustible music, but slapstick, too. Many of its songs feel half-finished or regurgitated in half-digested form, with verses that run on longer than they ordinarily might, choruses that repeat odd numbers of times instead of even ones, and abrupt shifts in tone and volume.

""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" features some allegory about the ozone layer, which in the late 1980s had the same conversational weight and place as ""climate change""; ""Gouge Away"" flirts with Catholicism. ""Hey"" is practically their ""Like a Prayer,"" an oblique gospel anchored by the premise that we too may one day break free our earthly bonds and ascend—a trope art has worked with for much longer than rock music has been around.</p>
<p>It's in <i>Doolittle</i>'s margins—the faux-hillbilly cackling of ""Mr. Grieves,"" ""There Goes My Gun"" and ""Dead""—that the album becomes what it really is. At heart, the Pixies were a kind of American goth band, fascinated by rural violence, the intersection of lust and danger, creepy innkeepers and the sexual magnetism of strangers who wander into roadside cafés from parts unknown. Their biggest crossover single, ""Here Comes Your Man,"" is less tied to European dada than the rustic imagery of a pulp paperback: The boxcar, the nowhere plains, the big stone and the broken crown.</p>
<p>About four years ago I moved from New York to Arizona and found myself listening to the the band's last two albums—1990's <b><i>Bossanova </i></b>and 1991's <i>Trompe Le Monde</i>—a lot. It's true what they say about the desert when they say it looks like the moon. Plants and animals seem proud to have survived the odds. <i>Bossanova</i> and <i>Trompe Le Monde</i> make sense to me here, when it's 110 degrees by lunch and the concrete ripples in the heat. They're narrower in scope than <i>Doolittle</i>, and have a tough, inorganic presence, like burnished chrome. </p>
<p>But I think what keeps more people from listening to them is that they seem like albums that don't care whether you listen to them or not. <i>Bossanova</i> is sweeter than <i>Trompe</i>, but its sweetness exists at an impossible distance. ""She's my fave, undressing in the sun,"" Francis whispers on the cryptic miniature, ""Ana"". ""Return to sea—bye. Forgetting everyone."" Later, on ""Havalina,"" he spots a <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/production.mediajoint.prx.org/public/piece_images/198430/JAVELINA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">javelina</a>—an ornery, boar-like animal not uncommon here—walking across a plain. The music is a slow dance between celestial bodies, heavenly but melancholic. So he sees the boar, and in two short lines, the song is over. Late Pixies songs are triumphs of private epiphany: Small, diamond-bright moments that flash in someone's eyes and then disappear forever.</p>
<p>By <b><i>Trompe Le Monde</i></b> the band had transitioned from seeming like quiet people who liked violent movies to violent people who didn't make much time for movies at all. This is outlaw music, sharpened by conspiracy theory and too much time with too little human contact. ""I had me a vision/ There wasn't any television/ From looking into the sun,"" Francis sings on ""Distance Equals Rate Times Time"", splitting ""sun"" into two syllables as though to make sure you heard him and are duly disturbed. He still howls and screams, but had also developed a new voice, a flat, posthuman kind of monotone. <i>Trompe</i> is more aggressive than anything in their catalog but also more confident. They can handle this now, and they do.</p>
<p>Francis' allusions to Catholicism turned into overt talk about UFOs, which makes sense when you remember that religion has always just been a way to explain the lights in the sky. A kind of concept album emerges, especially toward the album's end: a song about the geography of Mars followed by a song about a burnout named Jefrey—""with one f""—sitting on a carpet with a tabla, thinking about outer space, followed by Francis staring into the sun, a gesture made out of the desperation to find new answers. </p>
<p>For however classically far out the Pixies got toward the end, they had also never sounded so grounded. The album's climax, ""Motorway to Roswell"", is half-written from the perspective of an extraterrestrial, but turns on Francis' question: ""How could this so great, turn so shitty?/ He ended up in Army crates."" Reality had never made such a decisive appearance in a Pixies song.</p>
<p>The band came together in an unusual way but broke up like anyone else: Creative differences, in-fighting, the collision of fragile egos. Francis went on to make several solo records as Frank Black, one of which is called <i>Teenager of the Year</i> and is the sound of a creative person relinquishing himself of the pressures of being in a famous band and appreciating the practice of not giving a damn. Listen to ""Speedy Marie""; listen to ""Thalassocracy"". Feel the joy and the lightness. Then return to <i>Trompe Le Monde</i> and you can hear how angry Francis had become.</p>
<p>Kim Deal moved on to focus on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>, a project with her identical twin Kelley whose albums sound like abstract slumber-party music for teenagers with comfortable access to weed. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17942-the-breeders-lsxx/""><i>Last Splash</i></a> belongs in the Library of Congress, and their subsequent albums—<i>Title TK</i> and <i>Mountain Battles</i>—remain object lessons in how bands can remain weird without ever becoming alienating. </p>
<p>After 11 years of separation, the Pixies reunited and went on tour, becoming one of a slew of 80s and 90s alternative bands lobbying for heritage status. Francis never fully reconciled with Deal, who played several of the reunion shows but opted out of recent recording sessions and has embarked on her own time-capsule show, touring <i>Last Splash </i>with the Breeders. Deal's symbolic contributions were as important as her musical ones: The cool, down-to-earth woman who defused Francis' showy angst. She had actually been fired between <i>Doolittle</i> and <i>Bossanova </i>and subsequently rehired, and on later Pixies albums appears just often enough to reminds you that she's in the band.</p>
<p>The Pixies have now been reunited for four years longer than they were around to begin with, but are just getting around to releasing a new album, which they have called <b><i>Indie Cindy</i></b>. Worse than any of the music is the feeling that a band so deft at challenging the system has become part of it in the most predictable ways, rubbing together the tropes of their old art and hoping they can still start a fire, replacing experimentation with routine, filling Kim Deal's place with not one but two different bassists over the last five months, breaking up the album into three EPs to gin up interest, and generally reminding us that artists of their stature are businesses, not charities.</p>
<p>Things start decent and peter out quick. ""What Goes Boom"", ""Greens and Blues"", ""Indie Cindy"": these are slick songs, a little overextended and puffed up, intimidated by the band's legacy but charming in their own way. But part of what made the Pixies interesting is that they always seemed to possess some unquantifiable danger, which they no longer do. Three middle-aged guys seeing what happens when they get back on the horse and try again, they now sound most comfortable when they're being laid-back, ""Greens and Blues"" and the chorus of ""Indie Cindy"" especially. The album's lows aren't so much bad as routine. ""Snakes"", ""Blue Eyed Hexe"", et cetera: these are just distractions, breadsticks.</p>
<p><i>Indie Cindy</i>'s title track is built using the template of <i>Bossanova</i>: Spacey and gorgeous, shattered and dissonant, spacey and gorgeous again. Toward the end of the song, Francis offers the line, ""As we follow the bouncing the ball/ They call this dance the washed-up crawl,"" and then, a simple plea: ""Indie Cindy, be in love with me."" Part of loving the Pixies has always been the suspicion that they were gracing us from an alien place somewhere beyond love, where sentiment was never easy or necessary. It may be the most vulnerable line Francis ever wrote.</p></div>"|19282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19282-pixies-catalogue/|9.4|Mike Powell

Titled </i>Indie Cindy<i>, the record collects material from three EPs released over the past few months. Two of these EPs have been reviewed by Pitchfork, and both received exceptionally <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18560-pixies-ep-1/"">low</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18875-pixies-ep-2/"">marks</a>. </i><i>In the interest of avoiding redundancy with another standalone review of this material, we've instead chosen to explore the band's back catalog. Though none of the group's original albums have been reissued recently, they have never been reviewed by Pitchfork.</i></p>
<p><i>____</i></p>
<p>The great anecdote about the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> is that they formed when a college dropout going by the name Black Francis put out an ad for a female bass player who liked both the punk band Hüsker Dü and the folk trio Peter, Paul, and Mary.</p>
<p>The Venn diagram here would be tight. Hüsker Dü made noisy, bleeding-heart records for the underground label SST; Peter, Paul and Mary sang ""Puff, the Magic Dragon"". Francis got only one response, from a woman named Kim Deal. She had never played the bass before but presumably saw in his ad some sly humor and the spark of liberated thinking that lies behind a bad idea.</p>
<p>Crucially, the Pixies weren't from New York or Los Angeles, or even Chicago, but Boston: a famous place but fiercely provincial, with all the reticence of small-town New England and almost no cosmopolitan sheen. We can always depend on Boston for more sports and software engineers. Early on, Francis—a comic-book kid raised in an evangelical church—talked about the band's music with all the pretense of someone fixing toilets or laying shingle. ""You want to be different from other people, sure, so you throw in as many arbitrary things as possible,"" <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=CcNHQ-8NReEC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;lpg=PT90&amp;dq=simon+reynolds+%22pixies%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2b-_fZ-Cdl&amp;sig=k5cGetD-vX4a8GLP-NaqzRoM4E4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WplRU_SKFseHyASyr4CIBA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=pixies&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told the writer Simon Reynolds</a> shortly after their 1988 debut, <i>Surfer Rosa</i>. A few minutes later, the band's drummer, David Lovering, interrupted to describe a video he'd seen of ""people shooting eggs out of their ass, right across the room into another guy's mouth.""</p>
<p>The band's songs were about Old Testament Christianity, UFOs and white women who crave sex with big black men—fixations that in certain contexts can turn ordinary people into outcasts. Francis liked the surrealist movies of Luis Buñuel and David Lynch circa <i>Eraserhead</i>, which use violence not as a real-world dynamic but a metaphor for the roiling inner worlds we can cover up but never quite control. On a <i>Surfer Rosa</i> song called ""Cactus"", he begs a woman to cut herself up on a cactus and send him the bloody dress in the mail. For the Pixies, this passes as a ballad. In general they remain solid evidence for the theory that the darkest and most violent thinking is done by the quiet kids next door.</p>
<p>In March 1987, the band went into a warehouse studio called Fort Apache and worked for three days straight, producing 18 songs. The project cost a thousand dollars, including printing, tapes, and beer. Eight of these songs were released as <i><b>Come on Pilgrim</b></i> on 4AD, an English label that had built a reputation selling, moody, vague bands like Dead Can Dance and the Cocteau Twins but by 1987 had also released some Bulgarian choral music, the number-one dance-pop song ""Pump up the Volume"", and an album by their first American signing, the Throwing Muses. More recently, they've released albums by Deerhunter and Ariel Pink, and in general remain a safe home for uncommon art.</p>
<p><i>Pilgrim</i> is 20 minutes long and more of a hint at what the band could do than anything else. Two of its best songs (""Caribou"" and ""Vamos"") ended up being re-recorded in more muscular forms; another (""Nimrod's Son"") unfortunately wasn't. The other songs from the Fort Apache sessions—which came to be called ""The Purple Tape""—ended up scattered throughout the Pixies catalog, also in stronger versions. As much as the band changed and refined their sound over time, they seemed almost romantically attached to a big-bang concept of their own music, like a person who measures every relationship against that first love.</p>
<p><b><i>Surfer Rosa</i></b> is highly combustible music, but slapstick, too. Many of its songs feel half-finished or regurgitated in half-digested form, with verses that run on longer than they ordinarily might, choruses that repeat odd numbers of times instead of even ones, and abrupt shifts in tone and volume. Francis was less of a rock singer than a grotesque impression of one, too angry and too tender, a pantomime of extremes. He sounds new but seems to come from an old place, like an obscure bog predator with alien-looking adaptations.</p>
<p>But for all their radical ideas, the Pixies depended on convention—without it, they would have nothing to pick apart. Like Devo or Pere Ubu before them, they were an art-rock band steeped in the 1950s and early 60s, a period of music before rock was considered art. Their songs feed back to surf, boogie, doo-wop and early R&amp;B more easily than anything post-Beatles. The notion that they were changing the shape of alternative rock seemed like a nice bonus but immaterial. In an anecdote from the sessions for the band's 1988 album, <i>Doolittle</i>, Francis told producer Gil Norton that if two-minute songs were good enough for Buddy Holly, they were good enough for him.</p>
<p><b><i>Doolittle</i></b> is their most famous album and for understandable reasons. It's more even keel than <i>Surfer Rosa</i> and better mannered, too, forgoing the harsh live sound of Steve Albini for the lush, almost folksy one of Gil Norton, who had had previously worked with marshmallows like Echo and the Bunnymen. Its songs take aim at the big things important art is sometimes supposed to: good and evil, environmental ruin, Bible stories, death. ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" features some allegory about the ozone layer, which in the late 1980s had the same conversational weight and place as ""climate change""; ""Gouge Away"" flirts with Catholicism. ""Hey"" is practically their ""Like a Prayer,"" an oblique gospel anchored by the premise that we too may one day break free our earthly bonds and ascend—a trope art has worked with for much longer than rock music has been around.</p>
<p>It's in <i>Doolittle</i>'s margins—the faux-hillbilly cackling of ""Mr. Grieves,"" ""There Goes My Gun"" and ""Dead""—that the album becomes what it really is. At heart, the Pixies were a kind of American goth band, fascinated by rural violence, the intersection of lust and danger, creepy innkeepers and the sexual magnetism of strangers who wander into roadside cafés from parts unknown. Their biggest crossover single, ""Here Comes Your Man,"" is less tied to European dada than the rustic imagery of a pulp paperback: The boxcar, the nowhere plains, the big stone and the broken crown.</p>

Zion</a> briefly settled and released “Hang On to Each Other” as part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7168-horses-in-the-sky/""><i>Horses in the Sky</i></a>. Taking the “campfire song” descriptor quite literally, the band recorded the track around a campfire, which can be heard crackling away in the background. It’s mostly a vocal piece, aside from the rasping harmonium planted firmly in the distance. Thee Silver Mt. Zion loosely compartmentalized sections of <i>Horses in the Sky</i> when writing <a href=""http://cstrecords.com/cst033/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">notes</a> on the record, with “Hang On to Each Other” bracketed in the “love songs” portion. The original has an earthy, agrarian texture to it—a feeling eradicated on these two new versions of the track, which are about as close as this band will presumably ever come to producing a club banger. “The chords to that tune are like house music chords,” they <a href=""http://cstrecords.com/cst105/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claim</a>, explaining the desire to suddenly get their arpeggiator on.</p>
<p>Something that’s clear from the outset of the first version of the song, retitled “Any Fucking Thing You Love”, is that this isn’t some jokey dalliance with dance music. Nor is it coming from a place of naivety. “Most important thing = No irony,” they write. “Because we love that kind of music, and impromptu dance parties, too.” It’s an unabashedly nostalgic work based around zigzagging analog synth patterns and an ancient drum machine, topped off by a euphoric club diva vocal from Ariel Engle of <a href=""http://aroara.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AroarA</a>. Both versions of the song exceed 10 minutes, but there’s a feel for pacing that stops it from toppling into overkill. There’s nothing here that suggests Thee Silver Mt. Zion have an affinity for current developments in this field—if anything, it closely resembles the point where bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"">Primal Scream</a> laid down their guitars circa 1990 and headed out onto the dancefloor, albeit with an overriding feeling that this is a more temporary arrangement.</p>
<p>The better of the two versions is “Birds Toss Precious Flowers”, mainly because it has a darker, nastier edge to it. Here, Thee Silver Mt. Zion get close to filtering their familiar sound through an overtly electronic template. The keyboards are firmly set to distress when the song begins, but a more tender underbelly emerges as it progresses, edging toward that part of clubland that’s less about nihilistic “losing yourself” thrills and more about getting in touch with feelings. Engle’s vocal makes more sense here, often dipping close to melancholy as analog sounds grind and pulse behind her. If “Any Fucking Thing You Love” is their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDK2svrGG_c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Loaded”</a>, “Birds Toss Precious Flowers” is their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6474-xtrmntr/""><i>XTRMNTR</i></a>, bringing with it a huge industrial grind that suggests some of the visceral oppression of Thee Silver Mt. Zion tracks like “Take Away These Early Grave Blues” from last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18855-thee-silver-mt-zion-memorial-orchestra-fuck-off-get-free-we-pour-light-on-everything/""><i>Fuck Off Get Free We Pour Light on Everything</i></a>.</p>
<p>There are usually channels of optimistic thought that surface in Thee Silver Mt. Zion records, as Pitchfork’s Stuart Berman noted in his review of <i>Fuck Off Get Free</i>. In a sense this release isn’t so different in mood from their other work, bringing in equal shades of light and dark, and seeing hope amid all the dreams tossed carelessly to the roadside. It’s just that the tools used here are very different, to the point where it’s easy to feel like you’ve been transported to an alien place. Something <i>Hang On to Each Other</i> demonstrates, perhaps unwittingly, is how hard it is for musicians to let go of the core ideas that guide them, even when branching out in this manner. Still, there’s a strange comfort in seeing this band work this way, bringing their strong sense of dynamics into a different sphere in a move that’s both bold and—a word not often associated with Thee Silver Mt. Zion—fun.</p></div>"|19283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19283-thee-silver-mt-zion-memorial-orchestra-hang-on-to-each-other-ep/|6.4|Nick Neyland

The eccentric Atlanta rapper got a radio hit with “Stoner”, received A-lister remix treatment with Nicki Minaj taking on “Danny Glover”, and reportedly signed to Cash Money Records. But last month <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/naomizeichner/young-thug-trapped-major-label-deal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buzzfeed</a> investigated why Thug’s career seemed to be stalling just as it was taking off. They uncovered a messy label situation, including the fact that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"" target=""_blank"">Young Thug</a> is still signed to Gucci Mane’s imprint; turns out the pair recorded <i>Young Thugga Mane La Flare</i> last summer before Gucci went off to jail yet again.</p>
<p>Over the last half decade, Gucci Mane has progressed from potential pop-rap star featured on Usher and Swizz Beatz singles to an IRL rap villain whose relevance hangs on despite long stretches between minor hits. The two rappers’ contrasting career paths make <i>Young Thugga Mane La Flare </i>an opportune release for Gucci, allowing him to showcase the talent of his legally dubious label mate. And Thug responds, deploying every trick in his arsenal: squawking ad-libs, sung hooks, a multitude of vocal inflections. His vocal gymnastics aren’t just showboating though—on the chorus of “Bricks”, he increases the pitch of his voice to a nearly unintelligible heights and the same technique makes the laughably titled “OMG BRO” and “OMG” bizarrely catchy songs. He takes a bit from leaned-out Lil Wayne, astronaut-high Future, and Dancehall MC yelping, all of which makes Gucci Mane’s time on the top of the Southern rap landscape seem that much further away.</p>
<p>That said, Thug’s scattershot style makes Gucci Mane a grounded foil. The latter’s rapping, while still versatile, isn’t quite as dexterous as it was on releases like <i>From Zone 6 to Duval </i>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13793-the-burrprint-the-movie-3-d-the-state-vs-radric-davis/""><i>The Burrprint: The Movie 3-D</i></a>. Where Young Thug mixes observations about puppy-dog love with lyrics about his personal style and luxury goods, Gucci Mane remains agitated; his disdain for women, men, and, well, anyone outside his squad permeates every line. <i>Young Thugga Mane La Flare</i> exploits this contrast, but knows where the talent lies. Young Thug gets a majority of the recording time, which helps makes the tape almost feel like a solo project.</p>
<p>Gucci Mane has appeared on joint release with an up-and-coming Atlanta rappers like Rich Homie Quan, Young Scooter, Future, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15739-ferrari-boyz/"">Waka Flocka Flame</a> with varying degrees of success. <i>Young Thugga Mane La Flare </i>is the rare project where his own bleak grit is clearly outshined by a rapper, one who, in 2014, is operating in another stratosphere.</p></div>"|19290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19290-gucci-mane-young-thug-young-thugga-mane-la-flare/|6.9|David Turner

While the influence of that claustrophobic horror film about the dread of deepest space didn’t quite manifest itself doing nightly covers of “And You and I,” when Heard invested in new-fangled synthesizers and drum machines in the early '80s and struck out on his own, his love of sci-fi moved to the fore in his own music.</p>
<p>With tracks like “Distant Planet"", “Mystery of Love"", “Washing Machine"", and “Can U Feel it"", released under monikers like Mr. Fingers, Gherkin Jerks, Disco-D, The It, Blakk Society, Fingers, Inc., and more, Heard set the template for house, techno, deep house, and more for generations of electronic music producers—be they in Chicago or Detroit, or overseas in London and Berlin. Heard’s fundamental house music blueprints like Fingers, Inc.’s <i>Another Side</i> and Mr. Fingers’s <i>Ammnesia</i> are agonizingly long out of print, but slowly, portions of his back catalog are finally getting reissued. Last year brought about a reissue of his incredibly rare Gherkin Jerks’ EPs and now follows <i>Alien</i>, Heard’s third full-length under his own name, originally released in 1996.</p>
<p>While the two volumes of Heard’s <i>Sceneries Not Songs</i>, released in the early '90s, retained their deep house music underpinnings, with <i>Alien</i>, Heard ventured into unknown sonic terrain, fusing together styles that had long influenced him while largely jettisoning his telltale house beat. Wielding sci-fi soundtracks, slippery jazz fusion, progressive rock cues taken from personal favorites like Gentle Giant and Return to Forever, Heard ended up with an amalgam that in the hands of a lesser musician would be disastrous, if not tedious.</p>
<p><i>Alien</i> is not quite a house album with its beats scrubbed off, nor is it exclusively a chill-out soundtrack, and this reissue asks the question of just who the album was originally intended for. The sophisticated club kid wanting bachelor loft music? Adult-oriented jazz for househeads? Fusion for fusion aficionados? People who want the relaxing ambient version of the film <i>Alien</i>? Eighteen years after its original release, it remains a singular entry in Heard’s influential catalog, with the man composing the entire album on a Korg O1/W workstation keyboard, a Roland d550 and Oberheim Matrix 1000.</p>
<p>Opener “Faint Object Detection” is the album’s most menacing and dramatic track, reveling in the peculiarly juxtaposed ominous and relaxing moods conjured by Mike Oldfield's <i>Tubular Bells</i>. The ten-minute “Micro-Gravity” is the first of three expansive, suite-like epics contained on the album that blatantly evoke Heard’s prog-rock fixation; the opening two minutes of the track are full of dread before a pinging melody arises, leading into an bossanova-eque middle section, buoyant and melodic before swerving back into darkness near the track's end. Another double-digit excursion, “Galactic Travels Suite”, moves from space age musing to New Age meditation to downtempo nod, carefully avoiding the sonic trappings of all three.</p>
<p>You could mistake other album tracks for lite-jazz, while elsewhere, there are abstract electronic musings that could get mistaken for something off of Oneohtrix Point Never’s latest album, last year's <i>R Plus Seven</i>. The album only feels dated on the hip-hop moves of closer “The Beauty of Celeste”. Overall, the fact that Heard, one of the most important electronic musicians of the 20th century, could step away from the genre he built his legacy on while exploring the outermost reaches remains a remarkable feat. A <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/larry-heard--gentle-giant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Bull Music Academy lecture</a> esteemed Heard for “[putting] deepness into house music and [teaching] the machines some soul"", but on <i>Alien</i>, Heard also sent house music into deepest, darkest space.</p></div>"|19255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19255-larry-heard-alien-reissue/|7.8|Andy Beta

We could list off all the ways in which R&amp;B looks different than it did in 2008, or we could look at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">newest album</a>, which more or less encapsulates the zeitgeist: dance club beats, disco revival, smeared atmospherics, stuttering bedroom production, Drake, and Frank Ocean. The world Boykins returns to looks much different than the one he left.</p>
<p>But Boykins is an active participant in changing the rules of R&amp;B, too. In 2012, he released a collaborative album with a New York multimedia artist named MeLo-X, who describes himself as a “sonic creator.” Titled <i>Zulu Guru</i>, the record filters Boykins neo-soul classicism through the glitchy motherboard of Flying Lotus. With <i>Love Apparatus</i>, which is billed as his second solo album, Boykins teams up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2630-machine-drum/"" target=""_blank"">Machinedrum</a>, a polyglot electronic producer whose own beats shift like a man trying to wiggle his way out of handcuffs.</p>
<p>Boykins tabbing a junkyard instrumentalist like Machinedrum as his producer is left-field and interesting, and emphasizes his willingness to further break down whatever barriers may still exist between R&amp;B and the rest of music. But the pairing is better than a mere thought experiment: <i>Love Apparatus</i> is a warm, dreamy album that easily allows you to get lost in its glow.</p>
<p>It’s a quality of Boykins’ music that has carried over from his debut, which would have sounded right at home soundtracking a bossa nova club. But what’s impressive is that Boykins and Machinedrum have managed to maintain that atmosphere while distinctly digitizing his music. Now, you are eased into zoning out not by acoustic guitar strums and shakers, but by soft synth pads, misting keyboards and bass that feels like it burbles. This is the slow melting of neo-soul, as practiced similarly by newjacks (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a>, Frank Ocean) and old heads (Om’Mas Keith, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29167-bilal/"" target=""_blank"">Bilal</a>).</p>
<p>As such, Boykins’ songwriting is not exactly one of <i>Love Apparatus</i>’ selling points. When the album is at it’s worst, Boykins moves songs along like a car with a booted wheel. These are, uncoincidentally, often the tracks that up the tempo: the stilted “B4 the Night is Thru"", or “Tell Me"", or the amelodic “Live in Me.""  The best tracks are the dewdrops suspended in midair: the soothing opener “GreyScale,” “Show Me Who You Are” and its muted horns and “I Wish"", a longing track that would be equally at home on his debut or an early Robin Thicke album.</p>
<p>There is one song on the delightfully free-floating <i>Love Apparatus</i> that does hold weight, though. Wedged into the middle of the album is “4 U 2 B Free"", a sweeping track that in the hands of another songwriter might become a song like Coldplay’s “Lost!” It is out of step with the album, but its chorus also describes its new age-y appeal: “I’m lost in the world/ Lost in the world, made for you to be free.”</p></div>"|19275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19275-jesse-boykins-iii-love-apparatus/|6.8|Jordan Sargent

As it turns out, the only thing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a> do more expediently than release new music is hiatuses. Less than five months after frontman John Dwyer told a hometown audience at San Francisco’s Great American Music Hall that they wouldn’t be seeing the band in action for a while, Thee Oh Sees have reemerged with their eighth full-length record in six years (to say nothing of a 7"" and split-EP stream that that presumably puts as great a strain on America’s vinyl pressing plants as Record Store Day). And despite the significant developments in Dwyer’s life so far this year—like moving to L.A. and reuniting his early 2000s scuzz-rock combo the Coachwhips at SXSW<i>—Drop</i> turns out to be the next logical step in the progression undertaken on 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17866-thee-oh-sees-floating-coffin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Floating Coffin</i></a> and 2012’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17029-putrifiers-ii/"" target=""_blank""><i> Putrifiers II</i></a>, further reconciling Thee Oh Sees once-oppositional motorik-punk pummel and psychedelic-pop whimsy into a feel-good fuzz-rock groove. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53409-thee-oh-sees-go-on-indefinite-hiatus/"" target=""_blank"">Dwyer's morning-after clarification</a> of his onstage address didn't already defuse the uncertainty surrounding the Thee Oh Sees' future, the steady-as-she-goes nature of <i>Drop</i> renders the hiatus announcement a total blip non-event in the band's trajectory.</p>
<p>If anything, the increasingly refined, texturally detailed nature of their recent recordings—not to mention <a href=""http://www.theeohsees.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a way-lighter touring itinerary than usual</a>—suggests that Thee Oh Sees weren’t so much pondering a break-up as a Beatles-circa-’66 shake-up, easing up on the relentless road show in favour of a more considered approach in the studio. Accordingly, the songs on <i>Drop</i> aren’t so much tailored to the band’s notoriously blitzkrieged, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e6E8gelkY4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crowd-swarmed concerts</a> as the all-night after-party. That’s not to suggest it’s an especially mellow record; the noise and chaos linger, but Dwyer and co. are in less of a hurry to unleash it, preferring to patiently zone out rather than freak out.</p>
<p>Coming on like the come-down successors to <i>Putrifiers II</i> rave-up “Lupine Dominus”, the early double-shot of “Encrypted Bounce” and “Savage Victory” counts as two of the band’s most entrancing tracks to date: the former distills the serrated psychedelia of Pink Floyd’s “Interstellar Overdrive” and airtight groove of Can’s “Mother Sky” into <i>Nuggets</i>-sized dimensions, while the latter taps into the same spectral spirit as the Rolling Stones’ ace acid-rock oddity “2000 Light Years From Home”. But even though such familiar record-collector reference points abound on <i>Drop</i>, the mischievous melodies and funhouse-mirrored guitar contortions render the results unmistakably Oh Sees. After introducing itself with a mellontroned refrain uncannily similar to Aerosmith’s “Dream On” (not that there’s anything wrong with that), “The King’s Noise” shows Dwyer to be as in thrall to the early-’70s canon of Bowie, Bolan, and Lennon as peers like Ty Segall and The Smith Westerns—though, unlike them, he punctuates each verse line of faux-Brit diction with a destabilizing Yes-like arpeggio. And despite its titular allusion to every brostepper’s favorite sound, “Drop” actually splits the difference between the Who’s maximum R&amp;B and the Stooges’ <i>Raw Power</i>. (However, the Kinksian “Camera”—with its admission that “life is a camera and I cannot get near ya”—could very well be Dwyer’s dismissive comment on selfies.) </p>
<p>If <i>Drop</i> ultimately ranks a notch below its immediate predecessors in Thee Oh Sees’ discography, it’s for a couple of tracks that stick out as frivolous filler, like the repetitious, nursery-rhymed paisley pop of “Put Some Reverb on My Brother” and the drifting, synth-washed decadanse of “Transparent World”. But as per recent Thee Oh Sees tradition, the album comes to a peaceful balladic conclusion with the unabashedly Beatlesque “The Lens”, though in this case, it feels less like a strategic antidote to the anarchy that preceded it than a natural manifestation of <i>Drop</i>’s stress-free spirit. And yet, just when the song introduces a baroque harpsichord flourish grafted from the mid-section of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zicw_dVwhfM&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In My Life</a>”, it comes to a swift conclusion, as if the band were embarrassed by this uncharacteristic indulgence. It just goes to show that, even at their most relaxed and reverential, Thee Oh Sees’ feisty, impulsive essence still cuts through loud and clear.</p></div>"|19277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19277-thee-oh-sees-drop/|7.8|Stuart Berman

A Minor Forest wasn’t from Rapid City; they hailed from far-off San Francisco. But the band toured extensively throughout the country during its 90s-spanning existence, playing many of the same DIY venues that hosted the burgeoning post-hardcore and emo bands of that decade. If there’s one thing that brings people together, it’s cruel humor—and A Minor Forest, brooding and abrasive as well as downright delicate, knew a good joke when they heard it.</p>
<p><i>Flemish Altruism</i> was reissued on vinyl for this year’s Record Store Day, alongside A Minor Forest’s other studio album, 1998’s <i>Inindependence</i>. The rollout has been humble one, and it can’t help but be compared to Slint’s deservedly lavish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19182-slint-spiderland-remastered-box-set/""><i>Spiderland</i></a><i> </i>box set this month. Slint blazed trails with its dour, eerie ominousness; A Minor Forest, on the other hand, neither innovated nor intimidated. That doesn’t make <i>Flemish Altruism</i> any less tense. The shadow of Slint—as well of Slint’s slower, icier cousin, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16766-frigid-stars-barely-real-ep-the-white-birch/"">Codeine</a>—loom large over<i> </i>A Minor Forest’s distended syllables and dangling chords. The group had been honing that sound on singles and EPs since 1994, but <i>Flemish Altruism</i> tracks like “…But the Pants Stay On” and “Jacking Off George Lucas” groped for a new vocabulary out of the fragments laying around after post-rock’s early-90s Big Bang. What resulted was pidgin Slint—but in that process of restructuring, A Minor Forest came damn close to inventing <i>post</i>-post-rock, where the subgenre’s self-seriousness was wrestled with until it laughed, gasped, and collapsed.</p>
<p>Steve Albini and Bob Weston produced <i>Flemish Altruism</i>, and the nerve-tightening cello they’d previously captured on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18517-nirvana-in-utero-20th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>In Utero</i></a> feels almost deliberately evoked on the album’s most arresting song, “Perform the Critical Straw Transfer”. Singer/guitarist Erik Hoversten opens it with a deadpan punch line: “Guess you really lucked out…” he begins, his numb voice trailing off as bassist John Trevor Benson screams bestially yet faintly in the background, “…on this one.” Sarcasm never sounded so black. Beneath them, cellist Dominique Davison saws with quiet strength, as if mocking and apologizing at the same time. The screaming gets pushed to the fore on thoroughly non-dainty “Dainty Jack and His Amazing Technicolor Cloth Jacket”, an erratic spasm of dissonance that shows an affinity for San Diego screamo (A Minor Forest had previously recorded with Matt Anderson of Heroin), only broken up here and there with squibs of pinpoint jazziness. The balance is struck almost perfectly on “Bill’s Mom Likes to Fuck”, a 10-minute noise-cycle of mood swings, red herrings, and curdled blood.</p>
<p>The wiseass, scattershot racket of <i>Flemish Altruism</i> settles into a more predictable groove on <i>Inindependence</i>. Concise and controlled by comparison, A Minor Forest’s second and final album (not including their 1999 singles-and-EPs collection, …<i>So, Were They in Some Sort of Fight?</i>) drags more algebra into the rhythm and more calculation into the off-kilter melody. It wouldn’t be fair to say the band had begun to take itself either more or less seriously—but the music is more serious, and even the song titles are less crass. If “Erik’s Budding Romance” is to be taken at face value, that relationship flip-flopped randomly and often between coy, candlelit dinners and table-flipping eruptions of lust. Drummer Andee Connors, an unsung hero of his instrument and era, is in top form, coaxing every shade of texture, dynamic, and emotion out of the kit. There are honest, unabashed hooks on the deliciously brief (that is, under four minutes) centerpiece, “…It’s Salmon!!!”, as well as in “Michael Anthony”, which skips a sweet melody across a minefield of disjointed changes and chords. At the same time, the album’s 18-minute monster “The Smell of Hot” never fully jells; as A Minor Forest’s recording career drew to a halt, patience-testing jams occupied one extreme of their spectrum, while a hint of pleasing pop teased at the other.</p>
<p>A Minor Forest’s legacy is not a towering one. Most notably, Hoversten went on to play with Pinback, where he was able to indulge his love of angular melody much more avidly. The band never seemed to want to make bold statements, and it always punctured whatever atmosphere it crafted with wiry self-deprecation and perverse wit. When A Minor Forest reunited in 2013 after a 15-year hiatus, Hoversten said in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPKDvikbbVE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a radio interview</a>, “[This reunion is] sort of like, take an outfit you wore 15 years ago, then put it on today. Clearly you liked it at one point, but it’s not exactly the outfit you would have chosen today. That being said, it’s not like I’m being asked to put on a clown suit.” Despite their crank titles and in-jokes, A Minor Forest was never a funny band. But they had fun, and that fun seeped into their music. And that makes <i>Flemish Altruism</i> and <i>Inindependence</i> two of the most endlessly rewarding albums of the 90s post-rock boom, if never the most monolithic.</p></div>"|19238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19238-a-minor-forest-flemish-altruism-inindependence/|7.9|Jason Heller

When the so-called ""accidents, whores, and wrecks"" that populate <i>Broken</i> aren't screeching it out with the cops, they're drinking down or snorting up anything they can get ahold of. Yet, when Snyder insists ""the kids are still alright,"" he's onto something.</p>
<p>And Snyder knows a thing or two about ""the kids"": before Beach Slang, he spent the better part of the last 20 years co-fronting much-loved Bethlehem, Penn., punkers Weston. To a certain stripe of east-coast pop-punk fan, the Philadelphia-based Beach Slang must look something like a supergroup; Snyder's joined by Ex-Friends drummer JP Flexner and NONA bassist Ed McNulty. Between their pop-punk pedigree and their SPF-spackled moniker, you wouldn't be wrong to go into <i>Broken</i> expecting a little sunshine. But Beach Slang's got something stormier on offer: four self-described ""sweaty prayers"" set to hard-charging drums and heartbleed guitars.</p>
<p>""I watched your palm hug your guitar—it buzzes like a bomb,"" Snyder remembers most of the way through ""Get Lost"". There's a careening, about-to-explode urgency of the guitars on<i> Who Would Ever Want Anything So Broken?</i> that's every bit as crucial to these songs' emotional heft as Snyder's lyrics. Everywhere you turn, breathless rhythms crash headlong into blaring, yearning leads, a perfectly outsized complement to the widescreen, fucked-up-and-loving-it sentiments. What this sound lacks in subtlety, it more than makes up in desperation, and that tug between those darting leads and Snyder's whispered-in-your-ear vocalese is electrifying. ""I gave you taste, and a spine,"" Snyder sings on ""Filthy Luck"". The music drops out just in time for Snyder to stage-whisper his kiss-off: ""And I hope you drown."" The guitars charge back in a second later, the perfect punctuation to his seething passion.</p>
<p>While it's tempting to try to position the wild-eyed desperation in Beach Slang's music somewhere between the fuckup glory of the Replacements and the finely tuned angst of Jawbreaker, there's a considerably less cred-compatible touchpoint towering above the rest: the Goo Goo Dolls. Believe it or not, the hardscrabble Buffalo rockers turned adult-contempo mainstays are all over Broken; not so much the soggy ""Black Ballon""-era ballad-slinging Dolls, but the scrappy pre-""Iris"" Goos of ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBuvaMvdt4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Naked</a>"" or ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf4b2Wpm1Us"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Only One</a>"". The longing lead guitars, Snyder's closed-miced confessionals, those everything-is-riding-on-this-moment stakes? Textbook Rzeznik. Despite the current onslaught of 90s revivalism, few bands seemed less primed for cool-kid revivalism than the Goo Goo Dolls. But chasing coolness seems to be just about the last thing on Beach Slang's mind. They're an earnest bunch, and the things they sing about—outsized romances, youthful abandon, feeling pretty good about feeling pretty bad—deserve the kind of big, heartrending, leave-it-all-out-there drama this surging alterna-pop only amplifies. And, between you and me, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK6PiJCw_Jg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Long Way Down</a>"" still bangs.</p>
<p><i>Broken</i> is tantalizingly brief: four songs, 10 minutes, and barely a wasted breath. Still, it's not without its flaws: you'd need to consult the dental records to tell the ripcord melodies of ""Filthy Luck"" and ""Kids"" apart, while the limp harmonies that pepper ""Get Lost"" don't quite generate the same kind of heat as the three songs that surround it. But even when their nuts-and-bolts songwriting concerns falter, their passion rarely does: these songs feel like they bounded out of these guys fully formed, brash and urgent and very much alive. The people in Snyder's songs aren't always so good to themselves, but Snyder's awfully good to them: he celebrates their flaws, toasts their smallest successes, holds back their hair after another rough night. It may stick pretty close to the down-and-out, but <i>Broken</i>'s a fairly life-affirming record; these people aren't perfect, but they've got time to figure it out. For now, they're accruing scars, gathering stories, and getting by with a little help from their fucked-up friends.</p></div>"|19261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19261-beach-slang-who-would-ever-want-anything-so-broken-ep/|7.4|Paul Thompson

The port city of Murmansk lies far beyond the Arctic Circle, closer to Finland and Norway than anything else. Its unforgiving climate and overall isolation seems like a perfect breeding ground for raw black metal, and given these frozen surroundings, it’s not difficult to see why Old Wainds’ music has more in common with old-school Scandinavian black metal than much of what their countrymen are currently playing. The band’s approach is thrashy and melodic in equal measure, livening up the tremolo-picked grimness of dyed-in-the-wool Northern European black metal, even as they pay tribute to it. The sound is dynamic, atmospheric, and above all, addictive.</p>
<p><i>Nordraum</i>, Old Wainds’ fourth album since they formed in 1995, is genuinely catchy and surprisingly listenable; it’s graced with an understated production that lets the ugliness seep through. While earlier material was harsher and more one dimensional, <i>Nordraum</i> remains unrelenting and abrasive without sacrificing finesse. They've managed to stay true to the formula they’ve spent nearly two decades refining. Which isn’t to say it’s the most original record you’ll hear this year: Old Wainds remain the antithesis of trendy or progressive.</p>
<p>The band’s lyrical themes and aesthetic values run far closer to the old traditions, as well, focusing heavily on the Arctic, astrology, and bleakly picturesque depictions of gleaming snow and black moss. Where so many other Russian black metal bands choose to preach hatred and right wing ideology, Old Wainds concern themselves with Slavic mythology, heathenism, and nature. It’s jarring to acknowledge that in their native metal scene the band’s apolitical status is the exception, not the rule, but it’s important to remember that in some places, black metal is still dangerous. (Look up Russia’s Blazebirth Hall collective for ample proof of that.)</p>
<p><i>Nordraum</i> is their first full-length album to feature English song titles, and save for a 1996 demo and 2003 split with Nav, their only foray into the language. This gives those of us who are ignorant of their native tongue a small, rare glimpse into the band’s inner workings. Despite their far-out titles, songs like “Insane Stellar Race” and “Refracting the Light” owe more to Darkthrone than Roky Erickson, with the violent outpouring of “As Spilled Blood They Sprout” echoing more to the Finnish masters.</p>
<p>There are a few wrinkles. Mini-epic “Stoneweaver” is a marked divergence from the rest of the album with its depressive tempo and pretty guitar work. (The other long song, “Inquiring of Secrecies”, is a straightforward blaster that trips and crawls halfway through.) And “Ascension” opens the album with a few second of ominous synth before Old Wainds unchain the wolves and plunge into the fray. When they do punch in, bassist Kholdogor’s vocals go far beyond the categorical “agonized rasp.” He wheezes painfully, gasping for air like he’s drowning in bile. It’s more desperate than forceful, and finds him sink behind the chiming tremolo like a wounded beast. The guitar work from Morok is sound; it’s not terribly innovative, but it is impassioned, and almost joyous.</p>
<p>This is not a happy album by any stretch of the imagination, but the band’s enthusiasm for the material is apparent. One gets the impression they’ve been champing at the bit to bring these tunes into the world, and have gone about their business with gusto. Eternal “session drummer” Izbor anchors the recording with flair, slipping in more than a few clever ideas amidst his furious assault on the kit. Thanks to his breakneck pace, <i>Nordraum</i> itself flies by so fast that several of the songs blur into one another, and a certain homogenous quality emerges. When all is said and done, it's an excellent slab of traditional-minded black metal with an ear for songwriting. You’ve probably heard it all before, but for those who wish the 2000s had never happened, it should do the trick.</p></div>"|19189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19189-old-wainds-nordraum/|6.0|Kim Kelly

At the end of 2012, she released <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/howtodresswell/how-to-dress-well-it-was-u-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a reworking</a> of How to Dress Well's ""&amp; It Was U"" that darkened the original's empty-warehouse swing, smearing it with a claustrophobia that paired well with the remix's jungle-soaked vibes. A few months later, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/xlr8r/wildarms-full-hearts-doss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her remix</a> of Wildarms' ""Full Hearts"" operated in the same nocturnal space as its predecessor but was less portentous—it crossed the finish line with something that resembled catharsis if not straight-up joy.</p>
<p>And then last month ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16851-the-way-i-feel/"">The Way I Feel</a>"" arrived, the first completely original track from the recent Acéphale signee. What it shares with her earlier remixes is a foundation that leans toward the jungle/drum'n'bass end of the spectrum as well as a reverence for the sounds of early-to-mid 1990s dance music. But ""The Way I Feel"", along with the rest of Doss' self-titled debut EP, is a lot dreamier than either of the remixes that preceded it. The EP maintains a similar sense of propulsion but with a markedly lighter touch, its four tracks gliding effortlessly through the air rather than driving their way through viscous material. The blissed-out Lite-Brite melodicism of trance music can also be heard, except here it's removed from its big-tent origins and retrofitted for a more intimate setting.</p>
<p>""I don't care about anyone"" Doss sings in a hushed whisper on ""Softpretty"", which swirls with a jubilance seemingly at odds with this sentiment until you realize that it's not lament but rather a timestamp—there might not be a special someone in her life at this very moment, but the yearning in her voice belies a hope that at some point that <i>don't</i> becomes a <i>didn't</i>. ""Here Tonight"" slows things down to a trip-hoppier tempo before unleashing its percussive downpour just past the track's midpoint. It's the heaviest track on the EP, but even here its throbbing low-end is tempered by pastel-colored melodic lines that curl up and into the sky.</p>
<p>""Extended Mix"", which closes out the EP, stands out for its breathless precision, matching anthemic house chords to a stomp that evokes the sensation that things could careen out of control at any time. It's an evocative end to an EP that mines older sounds not for nostalgia's sake but for thematic material, embracing the fact that euphoria and melancholy are usually jumbled together and probably impossible to separate into pure strains. Her music has been described as ""the true sound of tomorrow"", and based on the evidence here, I'm almost certain that the irony of tomorrow sounding an awful lot like yesterday is not lost on Doss.</p></div>"|19284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19284-doss-doss-ep/|7.2|Renato Pagnani

In the 1990s, a group of friends in Bloomington, Indiana, heard his debut 7"" for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a>’s Palace Records, fell under the spell of that careening voice, and drove all the way to New York City to sign him. While not the fledgling label’s first release—SC001 is a reissue by North Dakota band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3242-june-panic/"">June Panic</a>—Molina was Secretly Canadian’s charter signing and would prove to be a franchise artist. Throughout his 15-year career, he built up a formidable catalog first as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26175-songs-ohia/"">Songs: Ohia</a> and later as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2945-magnolia-electric-co/"">Magnolia Electric Co.</a>, and the label has treated his music with great affection, reverence, and purpose, especially on 2007’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10516-sojourner/"">Sojourner</a></i>, which collected stray Magnolia Electric Co. recordings in a wooden box. After Molina’s sad passing last year following a long battle with alcoholism, Secretly Canadian began reissuing his back catalog, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18143-songs-ohia-hecla-griper-ep/"">obscure releases</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18704-songs-ohia-the-magnolia-electric-co/"">popular albums</a> alike.</p>
<p>The latest posthumous package is <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54445-songs-ohia-singles-collected-in-box-set/"">Journey On: Collected Singles</a>, </i>which gathers nine of Molina’s first 7"" singles, including that first Palace release, a few one-offs, and his sides of splits with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"">Oneida</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3037-scout-niblett/"">Scout Niblett</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5983-glen-hansard/"">Glen Hansard</a>. The vinyl comes in a canvas box with a CD, a wooden turntable adapter emblazoned with his crowssbow insignia, and a booklet with liner notes by Chicago writer Erin Osmon. It’s a handsome set, of course, and essentially a prequel to <i>Sojourner</i>—right down to the pinstriped record sleeves. If Magnolia Electric Co. was specifically an album-oriented project, one that fed into his fascination with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a> and other classic rock acts, then <i>Journey On</i> repositions Songs: Ohia as a singles act, one best served by the strictures and confines of the 7"" format. This is not entirely true, of course. Songs: Ohia’s spectral folk music inspired a number of excellent albums during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including its self-titled debut full-length and 1999’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7339-axxess-and-ace/"">Axxess &amp; Ace</a></i>.</p>
<p>As Osmon writes, the 7"" medium was chosen as much for its financial benefits as for its aesthetic appeal: “The goal of the 7”? To burn brightly, to share and inspire via a portable format that artists could afford to self-produce and ship and fan kids with shallow pockets could afford to buy at basement shows and ramschackle all-ages joints.” At this stage in his career, it was a good format for Molina, and <i>Journey On</i> reconnects him with this particular DIY scene, even if the collection might outprice such origins. His first release, “Boys,” was pressed onto a flexidisc for <i>Wingnut </i>magazine, which credited the song to “unknown artist” even as the front cover promised a “giant interview with the cryptic author of ‘Songs: Ohia.’” Nearly twenty years later “Boys” appeared on a flexidisc in <i>Wingnut</i> magazine, it’s hard to imagine how music this mysterious would have originally emerged, or how Molina and others cultivated that sense of shadowy enigma.</p>
<p>“Cryptic” is a perfect description of Molina’s approach to music, as these aren’t songs so much as they are ghost stories, possessed of a campfire intimacy and austere accompaniment. Most feature Molina alone with his guitar, occasionally with the distant patter of drums to suture the melodies together. Jennie Benford, of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2193-jim-and-jennie-and-the-pinetops/"">Jim &amp; Jennie and the Pinetops</a>, occasionally stops by for company, her voice adding a compassionate counterpart to his. Even when Molina plays with a full backing band (sometimes featuring his label founders), the music sounds skeletal, intimate, hushed, tortured. “Haunted” is a cliché for this style of music, yet there does seem to be some kind of hellhound on his trail; the world presses heavy on these songs. “It’s not just evil that stalks the American sky,” he sings on “The Gray Tower.” “It’s not just bad luck, it’s just what can happen.” What’s beyond evil? Nothing, and that nothing is much more frightening.</p>
<p>The 7"" format also allowed Molina the freedom to entertain new lyrical and musical concepts without having to fit the results into a longer work or worry about how they compliment other such experiments. <i>Journey On</i> rambles from the lo-fi dirge of “Boys” to the more polished acoustic picking and strumming of “Black Link to Fire Link”, yet he also understood the importance of silence to these songs. The most dramatic moments are when the instruments fall away to leave only his only his voice and the hesitant strums of his electric guitar. On “Keep It Steady,” the quiet between notes and syllables might even be louder than those notes and syllables.</p>
<p>A few of these songs would not be constrained by the 7"" format. “How to Be Perfect Men”, for example, appeared on 1999’s <i>Axxess &amp; Ace</i>, and “Lioness” anchored 2000’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7334-the-lioness/"">The Lioness</a>. </i>The emphasis on format, however, means that we can hear these songs in a slightly different context, and “Lioness” in particular resonates with much greater intensity here. The album version sounds like a rock song, with barbed guitar licks and an insistent tempo that underscores the chorus: “You can’t get here fast enough!” By contrast, the <i>Journey On</i> rendition turns the song into a duet, with Benford presumably voicing the title character. The pace plods, as though the moment before consummation is the most vivid aspect of such all-consuming lust. “Whether you save me, whether you savage me, I want my last look to be the moon in your eyes,” Molina sings, without flinching. It’s impossible to tell which would be preferable, and that ambiguity ranks the song among Molina’s most illuminating recorded moments.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s crucial to listen to these eighteen songs on vinyl. The CD plays like a long, meandering album that gently dulls some of the most intense moments here. To fully grasp these harrowing songs, it’s necessarily to play a side, then flip the record; to unsleeve and resleeve the vinyl between spins; to slip the adapter on and off the spindle; to consider each song individually. This is not a new way to hear Molina–in fact, it’s actually the oldest way to experience his music. Yet, the process of playing these 7"" singles makes these songs burn more brightly. </p></div>"|19245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19245-songs-ohia-journey-on-collected-singles/|8.4|Stephen M.

Media']|2014-04-23 00:00:00|2014|2016-06-11 16:38:37.652317|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".iu1irhdjb4.1.6:0.1.0.$19244/=1$19244.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Yes, there are plenty of good reasons to assume that an album called <i>P.T.S.D., </i>that's a metaphor about dealing with the music industry from a veteran rapper's rapper, would be an unbearable missive from the land of butthurt MCs. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5333-pharoahe-monch/"" target=""_blank"">Pharoahe Monch</a> is a perennial critical favorite and industry underdog who emerged, as half of the group Organized Konfusion, dropping complex multisyllabic rhymes about nebulous geopolitical threats all the way back in 1991, before that was a thing. He is literally who people are talking about when they talk about thoughtful MCs whose rhymes go over audiences' heads, which means he's also more or less the godfather of what's evolved into one of rap's most reliably insufferable styles. On top of that, he's a poster child for the way early '00s record label disorganization completely undercut the careers of a certain set of artists, since it took seven years for him to get out a follow-up to his pugnacious, widely admired 1999 solo debut <i>Internal Affairs</i>.</p>
<p>So, yes, you'll be forgiven for assuming that Pharoahe Monch's new album might just be a mouthpiece for all the concerns of cargo-shorted rap conservatives everywhere. It even opens with a loose sci-fi framing device that seems like a particularly bad omen: Pharoahe Monch has entered “Recollection”, a facility that extracts the memories of traumatic experiences from his brain, and the album will show those memories as they are extracted. But other than a few initial flashes of concern about whether we, as a population, are staying woke enough (“I ask: Are we comatose or unconscious?”), what follows is, for the most part, Pharoahe creating some of the more emotionally incisive and grounded music of his career. The promised music industry angle is thankfully more or less absent.</p>
<p>The theme that the album returns to most reliably is instead the psychological effects of various traumas, especially the kind that come from living in dangerous and impoverished circumstances—a topic that, despite being the subtext in a lot of rap music, doesn't tend to get addressed explicitly very much in any form of media. On “Lose My Mind”, Pharoahe refers to flashbacks prompted by police sirens and bluntly points out the challenge in the way that this environment is handled: “My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health/it was more or less an issue for white families with wealth.” Elsewhere he touches on the mind-dulling effects of anti-depressants, as well as his own struggles with severe asthma and self-doubt about his career. The album's best song, the soulful, detailed “Broken Again”, is delivered from the point of view of a heroin addict losing his place in society.</p>
<p>The hungry energy that defined Pharoahe when he was younger isn't quite as strong, but there's still a kind of intensity and occasional recklessness that makes him far more interesting than the bulk of currently en vogue young lyrical revivalists. “REM”, a collaboration with the Roots' Black Thought, may be a total boilerplate rap banger with its hook about being “crack music,” but it's also full of a kind of bravado—including a great bit about Pharoahe growing into a giant so he can pick up the rapper Ma$e and use him as a club to attack other rappers—that's refreshingly old school. The production mostly follows the cheesy, guitar-tinged template seemingly beloved of aging lyricists, but there are a few welcome curveballs, like Quelle Chris's squelching, frenetic beat for “Scream” and Pharoahe's own fascinating contribution, “Heroin Addict”, a tangled spoken-word interlude that could pass for a Gil Scott-Heron outtake.</p>
<p>At the same time, Pharoahe's insatiable desire to craft clever rhymes has always fostered a weakness for corniness, and even the best songs on <i>P.T.S.D.</i> are weighed down with clunkers. He's frequently distracted by wordplay, and other times he comes across like a high school teacher trying to be hip. When things do get really conscious, like on “Eht Dnarg Noisulli”, the result is painfully unsubtle, yielding nonsense like “17,000 times a day the human eye blinks/ making us even more subjectible to the hijinks.” Stabs at targets like rappers ""making pussy music” on “Bad M.F.” just feel out of touch.</p>
<p>While he might have been able to crack the Hot 100 in 1999, Pharoahe Monch is now about as far from mainstream rap's center as possible. It's hard to imagine ever being compelled to play many of the songs on <i>P.T.S.D. </i>for someone else. But the fundamental lack of coolness here shouldn't do anything to deter fans of Pharoahe Monch or even newcomers who aren't quite sure what they're getting into: It's a rich album that continues to play into the rapper's long-running strengths while taking a more personal, emotional look at the kinds of issues he's traditionally addressed with more inflammatory missives. What Pharoahe Monch is doing may not be as vitally important as it once was, but it still can feel surprisingly vital.</p></div>"|19244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19244-pharoahe-monch-ptsd-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/|6.6|Kyle Kramer

In this cramped shrine, tucked away inside Long Beach’s historic Lafayette hotel, hordes of young people moshed en masse to the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a> and Agent Orange. The music was pulverizing, to be sure, but there was much more danger to be found simply by looking around the room.

Formed by guitarist and principal songwriter Jeff Harp in 1983, the Long Beach quartet enlisted elements of thrash, black metal, and d-beat to lend their minute-long manifestoes an essential, acrid urgency. In 1987, they released their pulverizing debut album, <i>Ashes to Ashes—</i>a venom-soaked takedown of the Reagan years, as well as one of the decade's best crossover releases. Since its original pressing by Pusmort, the album has seen three more reissues, including one from Relapse.  Now, with Tankcrimes' Record Store Day reissue, <i>Ashes to Ashes</i> returns for its fifth lap around the ring,  just as sprightly and scowling as when it loped into our lives over a quarter-century ago.</p>
<p>During the height of the Orange County hardcore scene, bands' lists of influencers typically included their fellow Californians, along with NYC acts like Reagan Youth  Final Conflict's palette, on the other hand, combined the fever-pitch intensity of  UK crust-punk pioneers like Discharge and Amebix with the grizzled black metal of Crucifix. The ramped-up intensity and increased emphasis on technically-proficient solos enabled the band to carve out a newer, more brutal niche from the existing framework, lying somewhere between thrash's reptile-brain party mode and the tempered rage of heavy metal.</p>
<p>Jack Control's robust remaster creates some much-needed space, allowing Harp's toothed guitars to mingle alongside Warren Renfrow's nimble bass riffs,  rather than overwhelm them. Dave Phillip's drumming sounds more hot-blooded this time around, too, firing off snare hits into the abyss at the start of ""Apocalypse Now!"" and striking a throttling gallop on ""Crucifixion"". Control places Ron Martinez's vocal track lowest in the mix, so that at any given point, he's yowling from between his bandmates' slabs of sound like a trapped and wounded beast. These contrasts distinguish <i>Ashes to Ashes</i> as a work determined to distance itself from its more unilateral-sounding peers, providing enough smatterings of depth and texture to please even the most punk-a-phobic eardrums. It's a hardcore album, all right, but between Control's ear-friendly Mix and Harp's penchant for turbo-charged, hooky refrains on songs like ""Abolish Police"" and ""Constant Fear,""  there's enough pop appeal here to lure  in the Tony Hawk Pro Skater Soundtrack fanatics.</p>
<p>As the cover art suggests, the hand of the doomsday clock sits dangerously close to midnight for the entirety of <span>Ashes to Ashes</span><span>. Corrupt cops, rainforest-gutting corporations, the Reagan administration, the atomic bomb: disturbing images abound on the record, often sketched in excruciating detail. On “Constant Fear”, Martinez describes man’s annihilation by nuclear warhead through the sensuous image of “smoldering flesh underneath crumbling structures.” Elsewhere, “Abolish Police” and  “Self-Righteous Pigs” plaster the walls with grotesques of authority figures “playing hero” with civilian lives. The band even takes part in a little aural graffiti for the album’s closer, tearing down a sample of Reagan on the campaign trail with an instrumental sucker-punch.</span></p>
<p>A single listen of the included 1985 demo of the album (even more blistered and rabid than the studio version) sufficiently proves that even a quarter-century after its release, <i>Ashes to Ashes </i>continues to burn with a ferocity of which few hardcore albums can boast. There's no doubt that Final Conflict's rage has matured somewhat the passage of time (Trash Talk they ain't), but it's comforting to know that the white-hot fury of the band's Fenders Ballroom gigs hasn't retreated an inch. Long after the demise of L.A.'s infamous punk gangs, the poetic violence of Final Conflict's debut hits hardest of all.</p></div>"|19236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19236-final-conflict-ashes-to-ashes/|7.8|Zoe Camp

On their second album together, Planet Mu founder Mike Paradinas (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4402--ziq/"">µ-Ziq</a>) and his wife Lara Rix-Martin flirt with a dozen or more styles and subgenres without settling on any particular one for very long. The opening track, “Self Importance,” with its pulsating arpeggios and reverb-y synth strings, oscillates between 1980s acid house and '80s horror movie soundtrack vibes; from there, they make their way through gothy ambience, funky electro-pop, and sleek techno.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Despite <i>Weird Drift</i>'s genre-busting ambitions, the album feels humble and unpretentious. Paradinas has been making music for so long and in so many different styles that he has very little left to prove to anyone, so there’s nothing ostentatious or show-offy about the record’s genre excursions. And although Rix-Martin doesn’t have as many credits under her belt as her husband, her work curating his 2013 retrospective anthology <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18307-u-ziq-somerset-avenue-tracks-1992-1995/""><i>Somerset Avenue Tracks (1992-1995)</i></a> showed a refined, understated taste and an intuitive ear. They seem like smoothly synergistic collaborators, and even at its most adventurous <i>Weird Drift</i> still has a comfortably casual air.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are a few beautiful moments where that casual energy manifests beyond a series of pop references. “Rain” nails a specifically airy, chilly sound with an effortlessness that countless British pop-R&amp;B bands in the late '80s would have killed for, while “Lumber” balances a distorted rap beat and layers of ethereal vocals in a compellingly crooked way, resembling a new twist on trip-hop transmitted through a low-fi pirate radio frequency. Quasi-dub cut “Foghorn” interrupts a the album’s generally well-mannered mood with a resinous reggae bass line and blaring, <i>Inception</i>-style low brass that drift blissfully through clouds of Detroit techno synths and Funkadelic-style acid-rock solos.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Heterotic's easygoing experimentation provides one of <i>Weird Drift</i>’s strongest aspects, but it also works to the duo's disadvantage. The album’s peripatetic stylistic wandering takes it to interesting places, but it also lacks a cohesive aesthetic identity--it, well, drifts. When Paradinas and Rix-Martin head in a pop-focused direction, it sounds great in the moment but the hooks aren’t sharp enough to stick around afterwards. Largely, the album doesn’t possess much in the way of gravity or edge.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album finally finds the focus that it needs on the last song, “Empires”, which is ironically the record's sole moment where it also enters clichéd territory. A piano twinkles over slow-changing chords and a gently thumping kick drum, elements that skirt banality when paired with the inspirational mood conjured up by the arrangement's gently rising and falling action. The song sounds like something from a soundtrack for a feel-good sports movie, but it resonates in a way that the rest of <i>Weird Drift </i>fails to.</span></p></div>"|19273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19273-heterotic-weird-drift/|6.8|Miles Raymer

<p>A devotion to intimacy and earnestness unites the musicians on Orchid Tapes, and those qualities have been part of the label’s DNA since Warren Hildebrand, who's also behind the dreamy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=foxes+in+fiction"" target=""_blank"">Foxes in Fiction</a> project, founded Orchid Tapes in 2010. Initially, he created it as a way to release his debut album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14385-swung-from-the-branches/"" target=""_blank""><i>Swung From the Branches</i></a><i> </i>in a physical format), but soon Hildebrand connected with other bedroom-based artists via Myspace. Since then, his label's released music from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28621-coma-cinema/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Coma Cinema</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32107-ricky-eat-acid/"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Eat Acid</a>, whose <i>Three Love Songs </i>served as their first vinyl release earlier this year.</p>
<p>Ricky Eat Acid kicks off <i>Boring Ecstasy </i>with “Can You See It’s Bloom”, a woozy ambient-pop track that is one of two instrumental songs here. The other, Los Angeles producer Meishi Smile’s “Sincerity”, bookends the compilation on a fluttery, bittersweet note. The collection never settles for one particular style, instead letting each artist construct their own world without having to worry what’s happening around them, so the back-porch strumming of Alex G’s “Cards” co-exists peacefully with the drum-machine jitters of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31228-julia-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Brown’s</a> “Without You”.</p>
<p>The thread that ties many of <i>Boring Ecstasy</i>'s contributors together is a neck-breathing closeness. Hildebrand’s contribution as Foxes in Fiction, “Rearrange”, slowly builds up from washes of guitar, but even as the music ebbs and flows, his words float through. Wisconsin-born, Berlin-based artist Yohuna delivers one of <i>Boring Ecstasy’s </i>most memorable cuts with the slow-burning “Badges,” which mixes synthesizers with her stretched-out vocals to create something radiating warmth.</p>
<p>There are missteps: Euphoria Again’s “Change” is one of the most stripped-down numbers here, but it lags, while The Sweater I Gave You’s “Nobody’s Baby” is too cluttered, taking away from the Oregon project’s usual charm. Daniel Abary’s Four Visions makes the noisier approach work better on “Hazy Past”, an appropriately fuzz-tinged song prone to moments of clatter that constantly shifts instead of succumbing to tedium. Infinity Crush’s “Spoiled” is nothing more than White’s singing and some guitar, but she delivers both with unblinking directness, punctuated by self-targeted lines like “I feel like shit/ We know, get over it.”</p>
<p>“Spoiled’s” lyrics touch on the other important aesthetic pillar of the artists affiliated with Orchid Tapes: they aren’t shy about baring their feelings<i>, so Boring Ecstasy </i>focuses on love gained and lost, usually against the backdrop of everyday happenings. “What’s the point of the leaves changing color/ I can’t watch them change with you,” Julia Brown’s Sam Ray sings on ""Without You"", the words out of step with the music surrounding it, underlining the desperation contained within. “The overall idea that we try to go for is releasing music by people who are really dedicated and put a lot of themselves into their music and don't try to follow any passing Internet trends or anything,” Hildebrand <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/warren-hildebrand-foxes-in-fiction-orchid-tapes/#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Interview Magazine</a>, and that comes through on <i>Boring Ecstasy</i>, a collection of music from bedroom artists unafraid to lean in close and expose their feelings, all while never sounding one bit alienating.  </p></div>"|19254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19254-boring-ecstasy-the-bedroom-pop-of-orchid-tapes/|7.3|Patrick St. Michel

Coupled with a penchant for interstellar iconography, the vocal modification frequently attracted science fiction descriptors, portraits of the artist as a moody machine. But <i>Pluto</i>’s most gripping cuts (“<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIrhcTkHX_A&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Turn on the Lights</a>”, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikTOJ79fP8A&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You Deserve It</a>”) took flight by scaling back the mods to focus on the unnerving frailty of a singer unafraid to skim around and across the break in his voice. Even in moments where <i>Pluto</i>’s vocals were heavily processed, the most captivating quality was the humanity poking through. So let’s set aside this robot business.</p>
<p><i>Pluto</i>’s greatest success was opening new avenues in Future’s songwriting. At the time, his calling card was the trap house shouter: 2011–12 mixtape highlights “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf7IOyn-hxw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tony Montana</a>”, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g8XS_ix_Dk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Magic</a>”, and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYpaRu7ZcJk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Same Damn Time</a>” delivered dopeboy truisms via battering ram. <i>Pluto </i>collected those cuts for good measure, but otherwise it dispensed with the tough guy shit, reintroducing Future as a lovelorn hook man. As with Kanye’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/""><i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i></a>, the transition from rapping to singing was smoothed out by a T-painian dollop of purposefully overdriven pitch correcting tech and confessional emotionalism. The gambit worked, but the album was a touch too reliant on its crutches in retrospect. After a protracted streak of hijacking Top 40 smashes like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEkcYsqu6MU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">U.O.E.N.O.</a>” and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djE-BLrdDDc&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bugatti</a>”, spitballing weirdness out on mixtapes, and farming his more saccharine ideas out to pure singers from Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus to Rihanna and his fiance Ciara, Future finally returns with his second proper full-length, <i>Honest</i>. </p>
<p>Future’s got a notably greater command of his instrument two years on from <i>Pluto</i>, and to that end, much of the Auto-Tune and reverb that occasionally gave the first album’s vocals the distance of a radio transmission have been scrubbed. The training wheels are off. Fight songs like “My Momma” and “Covered N Money” draw their intensity from the quirky sound of a voice giving out screaming the titular choruses, a trick perfected on the searing pre-album street single “SH!T”. Flubbed notes are left in for character rather than squeegeed out by computers, but there’s less of those than ever because writing for and performing alongside other singers has worked wonders for Future’s range. The rousing upper register chorus for “Blood, Sweat, Tears” and the slick falsetto hook on “Honest” wouldn’t have worked with his voice before. “Never Satisfied” refuses to let Drake do the heavy lifting as Future confidently soars past the Toronto MC’s introspective vocalizing in between choruses. And where guests were once employed to secure a measure of credibility, now they hover in Future’s orbit: Drake gets faded out mid-chorus on the two-minute “Never Satisfied”, and even when Kanye parks the Kardashian roadshow in back of “I Won”, he sticks to the script. </p>
<p><i>Honest </i>relinquishes <i>Pluto</i>’s romantic tendencies as well, retaining a personal bent without resorting to pining for affection to achieve it. In a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9365-future/"">interview with Pitchfork</a>, Future said flatly, “There are no love songs on this album,” although mid-album stunners “I Won” and “I Be U” teem with pride and excitement about meeting the mate he yearned for on “Turn Out the Lights”. Otherwise, <i>Honest </i>prefers to buck expectations by sneering through the slow jams. Deep cut “Special” is all somber strummed guitars and taunts for an ex who couldn’t handle the fame. (“You ain’t even tryin’ to be special.”) The title track uses a sedate piano-filled production from DJ Spinz and Metro Boomin to coolly revel in newfound wealth and status in a wan, sad deadpan. (“I’m a rock star for life, I’m just being honest.”) <i>Honest </i>is consistently moneyed and aspirational in all the places you might’ve previously expected sap.</p>
<p>Future’s eagerness to escape his old tics and methods also means moving away from trap. There’s still room for grisly, gothic stompers from a murderer’s row of 808 architects from Nard &amp; B to Sonny Digital and 808 Mafia, but <i>Honest</i>’s production is expansive. “Look Ahead” outfits a sample of Amadou and Mariam’s Santigold-assisted “Dougou Badia” with kicks, claps, and guitars for a powerhouse opening argument for Future’s growth. Fresh off a year of platinum hits, frequent collaborator Mike WiLL Made It has gotten weird: he approximates Noah “40” Shebib’s pulsating bass and muted drums on “Never Satisfied” and affixes rattling low end to the gritty, almost atonal synths of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHguy4xHGSg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Move That Dope</a>” like a Southern rap Trent Reznor. The album closes with “Blood, Sweat, Tears”, a sermon about the fruits of perseverance delivered over martial drums and wrenching strings specifically designed, it would seem, to blow the lid off arenas.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The searching stream of mixtapes and loosies that followed <i>Pluto </i>appeared to many to signify a struggle to maintain footing in an industry notorious for feeding on Atlanta rap sensations and casting them aside once the hits dry up. But <i>Honest </i>surges with the self-assurance of an artist finally coming into his own. The bruisers are icepick sharp, the ballads restlessly toy with convention, and Future’s heightened ease with both makes <i>Pluto </i>look like a transitional album in retrospect, the dress rehearsal for this, the actual takeover.</p></div>"|19221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19221-future-honest/|8.1|Craig Jenkins

It seems unlikely—sound design is such an integral part of his filmmaking that it usually says as much as the images. That’s why it was apt that the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16948-eraserhead/"">soundtrack</a> for his early film <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eraserhead </a></i> merely presented unedited stretches of the movie’s audio. Those excerpts contain enough information, moods, and atmosphere to create meaning on their own, without needing any help from pictures.<i></i></p>
<p><i>The Air Is on Fire </i> is trickier, because the sound Lynch made for it literally <i>is </i><span>background music. It played on two floors of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Paris gallery</a> during a 2007 exhibition of Lynch’s visual art. While I imagine Lynch and sound editor Dean Hurley didn’t intend their work as background—they’ve called it an “interactive soundscape”—the setting gave them less control over the marriage of sound and image than film offers. Few visitors would hear the exact same thing while looking at any given piece of art, and whether any would absorb the entire 41-minute soundtrack in real time was out of Lynch’s hands. Those factors increase the range of effects the piece could have—practically to infinity—but they also increase the chances that it would be experienced as sonic wallpaper.</span></p>
<p>You might guess that such indeterminancy wouldn’t deter Lynch from packing as much narrative and emotional density into <i>The Air Is on Fire </i> as he does in his films, and you’d be right. In fact, though I would’ve loved to see the original installation, I’m glad my first encounter with this was as one continuous piece divorced from imagery. Because there’s more than enough going on inside it to capture attention and encourage focused listening. There are literal events—knocks, wind, footsteps, thunder—that suggest plot points, and tangible atmospheres that set scenes. It may be cliche to call instrumental music “cinematic,” but <i>The Air Is on Fire</i> clearly has the sequential, impressionistic effect of film. It’s a movie projected into the head through the ears.</p>
<p>Part of what makes it so cinematic is the way it balances the narrative and the abstract, much like Lynch’s films. There are clear steps and turns, obvious moves forward and significant retreats. But there are also moments of pure texture, in which creating an indefinite feeling is more important than painting a specific picture. There are points in between, too, and those are the most fascinating: a section that sounds like a slowed-down show tune underwater, a rumble that could either be the echo of a cave or the ghosts of human voices, a dramatic turn that’s like a symphonic string section shot into space. As all these elements melt into one uniterrupted stream, it’s easy to enjoy as sonic drift, as a dark river to float down. But focus your ears a bit and more profound, moving moments emerge.</p>
<p>How Lynch and Hurley compare in those moments to musicians more seasoned at this kind of music is a tough question. I’m sure much of what they do here has been done by others; the blackened caves of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/""><span>Demdike Stare</span></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"">the Haxan Cloak</a> come to mind immediately. But really, Lynch has developed as deep a sonic vocabulary as anyone - he’s just done it through an audiovisual medium rather than a purely aural one. And besides, it doesn't sound like he was worried about breaking ground here. Even at its densest, <i>The Air Is on Fire </i> is pretty simple sonically, which gives it a universal tone. It’s not about cutting-edge techniques or never-heard-before concoctions. It’s about using sound to tell a wordless story and evoke undefined emotions. On those counts, it succeeds thoroughly.</p></div>"|19274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19274-david-lynch-the-air-is-on-fire/|7.8|Marc Masters

The narrator in these songs risks being consumed, overwhelmed, sunk like a stone, or washed away completely. The drowned romanticism of the band’s lyrics (“I tried my best to destroy you but the waves/ Keep overflowing me/ Washing me out ‘till I’m empty”) is reflected in their music as well—a kind of delicate, twilight indie pop swirl that belies the heady darkness that seems to always be simmering just underneath. At first listen, <i>Loom</i> plays like an appropriately wistful dream pop cousin to Young Marble Giants or the Marine Girls (or something resembling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"" target=""_blank"">Camera Obscura</a>’s awkward stepsister). But underneath all the jingle-jangling guitars and twee musical meanderings, Fear of Men are quietly seething—a prim librarian who just happens to carry a warm switchblade in her book bag.</p>
<p>Fear of Men is essentially the work of two mindful British art students: Jessica Weiss (guitarist and vocalist) and Daniel Falvey (guitarist). Taking their name from a rare anxiety disorder (“androphobia” is an abnormal and persistent fear of men), the band set about making songs that took on mortality, mental illness, and loneliness and set them against a melodic backdrop of Smiths-like guitars. The fruits of the band’s early efforts were collected into an aptly named 2013 collection called <i>Early Fragments</i>, a release that showcased the band’s ability to marry the beautiful with the slyly profane. It’s a concept the band pushes even further on <i>Loom</i>. When Weiss sings “Lie alone until the dark takes it all/ Without a body, I am free to dissolve,” it’s a fitting descriptor of the band’s aesthetic: Personal melancholy and romantic dread loom large, while an ever-present ocean of ambiguously deep feelings threatens to wash everything away.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Loom</i> is a nice step forward. “Green Sea” and “Seer”—both of which appeared previously on <i>Fragments</i>—sound bigger and bolder here, each benefiting from more assured production. The record’s best songs—“Inside” and “Descent” among them—balance the record’s darkest lyrical sentiments against it’s brightest melodies, which generally proves to be Fear of Men’s neatest trick. Though the band’s committed DIY aesthetic is admirable—they employ a strict hands-on approach to everything, from the production of the music to the album art to the band’s videos—the music might be better served by the help of an outside producer. This is far and away a more sanguine listening experience than anything the band has recorded before, but even with the addition of a full-time drummer (Michael Miles) and a live bassist (Becky Wilkie), the rhythm section can’t deliver the kind of punch the material demands. And the album’s shimmery sameness (and turgid melancholy) eventually starts to feel a bit rote.</p>
<p>When the band does cut loose, as they do on the sublime “America”, the albums’s best track, you get a sense where they might go next. The song veers from gentle strummer and escapist fantasy to something resembling heaviness, with diaphanous guitar lines momentarily giving way to a bit of roiling feedback and what sounds like a tiny little amp being mercilessly overdriven. It’s a rare moment of abandon.

In fact, the first Death collection, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12673-for-the-whole-world-to-see/"">…For the Whole World to See</a></i>, went out of its way to reinforce this image. Here were a trio of African-American brothers from Detroit who—before the Ramones had released a record—laid down a lean, ferocious form of rock'n'roll. But even that initial anthology of songs, as carefully as it was curated, showed that Death always had more going on—an impression driven home by 2011’s more varied (if less consistent) <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15060-spiritual-mental-physical/"">Spiritual, Mental, Physical</a></i>. Like The MC5 before them, Death drew from the lineage of Detroit R&amp;B—and not just the commercial Motown variety—while sinking their teeth into the darker side of feedback-laced psychedelia and hard rock.</p>
<p>The selling of Death as a proto-punk band certainly helped the long-lost group catch the attention of modern listeners, especially now that they’ve reformed (minus their late leader, guitarist David Hackney). But with their third archival release, <i>Death III</i>, it’s become even clearer that Death had much more than spit and snarl up their sleeves. “North Street” pulses and pounces, but it does so fluidly—and with a bluesy lasciviousness that’s more Thin Lizzy than the Stooges. That aggression carries over into “Restlessness”, a pummeling confessional that melds the homegrown chops of David, bassist-vocalist Bobby Hackney, and drummer Dannis Hackney into a smoothly pneumatic machine. And while the drumless demos “Introduction by David” and “Free” show off little more than searing tones and promising ideas, they’re not significantly sketchier than the studio tracks “Yes He’s Coming”, with its tinges of echoing, off-kilter gospel, and “Open Road”, an awkward, start-stop speed-waltz that highlights Death at their least together and coherent. Death always reached for something just beyond their collective talent, and that’s both the strength and weakness of these recordings—and a reflection of David’s lifelong, and ultimately frustrated, quest toward a spiritual ideal.</p>
<p>The 2013 documentary <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDPDm9_nX0o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Band Called Death</a></i> simultaneously reinforces and undermines the image of Death as punk godfathers. Even as the word “punk” gets bandied loosely about in the film, some of David’s gentlest compositions, “We Are Only People” and “We’re Gonna Make It”, are featured prominently in the soundtrack. <i>Death III </i>includes both those songs: “We Are Only People” is a spacious guitar meditation that starts out sounding like an interlude off a Hendrix bootleg before morphing into a sprawl of raw yet progressive funk, something Earth, Wind &amp; Fire might have made in the 70s if they’d been a stripped-down, lo-fi garage band. “We’re Gonna Make It” hails from 1992, when the brothers briefly reunited; sweetly clunky, it’s a nugget of uplifting pop-rock—with an almost countrified undertone—that’s poignant because of its corniness, not despite it.</p>
<p>When you take into account the Hackneys’ full body of work—from their R&amp;B outfit that existed before Death, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbQVEIkuKYE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RockFire Funk Express</a>, to their Christian-rock outfit that existed after Death, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM5fmvzMobM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the 4th Movement</a>—it becomes clear that the “punk” tag they’ve been saddled with is as inaccurate as it is limiting. Even defining punk in its broadest terms, as an ethic rather than an aesthetic, doesn’t cover what Death was truly about. They were in many ways uncompromising—but as <i>Death III</i> shows, they were just as happy to make sweet, pleasing music in the hopes of reaching a larger audience. That conflict of sound and approach, a symptom of the group’s internal tensions as musicians and as siblings, makes these songs both more soulful and tougher to cram in a pigeonhole. The best thing about <i>Death III </i>is that it finally unravels the narrative set up by their previous two albums: that Death was a punk band, one that in some way may have even helped invent punk. It’s an absurd notion, and one that sells short what the Hackney Brothers actually accomplished. The truth is much messier, and much more beautiful.</p></div>"|19228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19228-death-iii/|6.5|Jason Heller

He had a baby-faced selfie profile picture and a few tracks to his name: an 80s-tinged Balearic remix of Ariel Pink’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15029-round-and-round-little-loud-remix/%20http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15029-round-and-round-little-loud-remix/"" target=""_blank"">“Round and Round”</a>, an Acéphale-commissioned rework of Memory Tapes’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14216-bicycle-little-loud-remix/"" target=""_blank"">“Bicycle”</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14512-nice-girls-little-loud-remix/"" target=""_blank"">another version </a>of HEALTH’s “Nice Girls” as part of a companion remix album to their <i>Disco2</i>. His remixes were pretty standard—add a 4/4 beat and chopped-up vocals to any song, sit back, and watch it go to number one on Hype Machine—but an artistic sensibility, however indefinable, began to emerge.</p>
<p>In 2012, Phillips released his first EP under the new moniker Tourist: <i>Placid Acid</i>, four songs of sun-dazed beats and melodies that shifted and sparkled like the equatorial sun on a calm sea. It was a pleasant debut, if not very distinctive from other blissed-out jams with cutesy names, like Slow Magic’s <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/slowmagic/corvette-cassette"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Corvette Cassette”</a>, which made similar Soundcloud rounds the year before. Six months later, Phillips changed approaches with <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/touristmusic/sharon-van-etten-we-are-fine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a remix</a> of Sharon Van Etten’s chronicle of a panic attack, “We Are Fine”. He replaced Van Etten’s ukulele with throbbing, haunted synths and skittering percussion, hinting at a developing emotional and musical complexity that in turn foreshadowed Tourist’s 2013 <i>Tonight</i> EP.</p>
<p>“You know a Venn diagram,"" Phillips <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/code/5922960/tourist-announces-us-tour-confirms-ep-release-date%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told <i>Billboard</i></a> earlier this year. ""My left circle would be electronic music and the right circle would be emotions, atmosphere, honesty.” It’s not the most unique thought—you’d be hard-pressed to find an artist, electronic or otherwise, claiming <i>not</i> to care about those things—but the idea gets at something he started doing very well in the beginning of last year. There’s a newfound sense of longing and urgency in the minor chords and driving pulse of an elegant banger like <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/touristmusic/never-stop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Never Stop”</a>, which undoubtedly helped get him signed to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a>’s Method label last summer. Tourist then released a string of higher-profile indie remixes (<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/touristmusic/haim-the-wire-tourist-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a>, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/chvrches/lies-tourist-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chvrches</a>, Sam Smith) in the lead-up to his <i>Patterns</i> EP, which was steadily pushed back from a December release date to give Tourist more time to reinvent himself on the tour circuit as well.</p>
<p>The most immediately noticeable difference between the Disclosure-affiliated Tourist and the Tourist formerly known as Little Loud is guest vocalists. Album closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16646-i-cant-keep-up-ft-will-heard/"">“I Can’t Keep Up”</a> features singer and occasional saxophonist Will Heard, who most notably appeared on Klangkarussell’s soulful UK hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79YDgv_zWA4&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Sonnentanz”</a>. With Tourist at the helm, Heard takes a darker turn, asking, “Won’t somebody give a fuck?” as the producer ramps up tension with a quickening pulse that rockets to 130 BPM before just as suddenly slowing down again. “I refuse to fall,” Heard sings, the last word echoing as if he’s already tumbling into the abyss. The title track, which opens with scattershot ping-pong synths straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/"">SBTRKT</a>’s playbook, is led by Lianne La Havas. Phillips doesn’t seem to know quite what to do with her here, supplementing her buttery voice with a background chorus that’s ultimately more distracting than anthemic.</p>
<p>“Trust in You” eases into <i>Patterns</i> with cascading vocal samples and judicious xylophones, its clickety-split backing track setting the EP’s overall urgent tone that finds full expression in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16073-together/%20"">“Together”</a>, Tourist’s most ambitious effort to date. His first release after signing to Method (and <i>Patterns</i>’ lead single) is something of a coming-out party, Phillips busting through any preconceived notions of him as an artist with a hi-NRG gallop riding the irresistibly universal refrain “We should be together.” It’s masterfully crafted, from the restrained fade-in and exhausted fade-out to the arpeggiated synths that take it to the bridge, quietly bow out, and then resurface for the final sprint to the finish line.</p>
<p>For the first time, it sounds like Tourist has something to lose: in that same interview with <i>Billboard</i>, he said, “There’s something dangerous about getting big because you make your success on certain defining records.” With “Together”—and <i>Patterns</i> in general, which sets a promising tone for Tourist's continued artistic development—he may have found that record.</p></div>"|19252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19252-tourist-patterns-ep/|7.5|Harley Brown

It showcased a small shrine to the band—replete with candles, flowers, and an empty bottle of Jameson—alongside some framed photos, a flat screen TV playing the 2012 documentary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47439-lcd-soundsystem-film-shut-up-and-play-the-hits-gets-dvdblu-ray-release-date/""><i>Shut Up and Play the Hits</i></a> on mute, and a glitchy projection of random home-movie style footage of the group. There were also five portable <a href=""http://www.numark.com/product/pt01usb"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Numark</a> turntables set up, each spinning one of the discs from the box-set chronicle of their 2011 finale, <i>The Long Goodbye: LCD Soundsystem Live at Madison Square Garden</i>. The whole white-walled room felt like a well-intentioned relic—a cheap museum piece that barely hinted at the too-recent memories it was designed to revive. The same could be said of the entire Rough Trade store, which has all of the hallmarks of Tower Records of yore—plenty of space, high retail prices, huge promo posters—but now with an added level of desperate nostalgia. The visit left me a bit dulled—experiencing the halfhearted fossilization of your youth will do that. But something less soul-shattering stuck with me, too. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Stamped onto the wall above the LCD shrine were little hand-written love notes to the band by fans who had previously stopped by the space. Some were weird (""James, I once rubbed your back at a ramen restaurant, it was so creepy and so awesome""), some gushed (""James Murphy is my David Bowie""), and some were all too real (""Thanks for making me realize that it was OK that I hadn't achieved my goals by the age of 25""). More than anything else in the room, those scrawled bits of Sharpie resonated, and they reminded me of the crowd noise that hums underneath much of <i>The Long Goodbye</i>'s 187 minutes. That last LCD show was as much of a party as a concert, an extended celebration of goodwill, good taste, and the fact that something so relentlessly sharp and gracious could reach such a rarified place within the culture. It was also really long. Which made sense. LCD Soundsystem were not a greatest hits band. They were band for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7947-you-were-there-the-complete-lcd-soundsystem/"">completists</a>, by completists. This is one reason why <i>The Long Goodbye</i> is such an apt punctuation. It is a largely unedited document of everything this band had to offer: the laughs, the tears, the disco, the rock, the cowbell, the deep cuts. And if you were to listen to this five-disc set front-to-back on a turntable, you'd need to flip or change the record a total of nine times—a very serious commitment in today's stream of endless one-click playlists.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Speaking of vinyl, it is no coincidence that this item is originally seeing life as one of those Record Store Day specials. Along with its superfan collectibility, the box's presentation is spare, monochrome, and elegant, and Murphy tweaked the audio with needles and grooves in mind. ""We're totally not making a CD of this or anything, because it's not 1997,"" he quips on a tiny square download card. And while <i>The Long Goodbye</i> will get a digital release next month, he stresses that ""it's really mixed for vinyl."" Having heard both the WAV files and LPs, I can report that the overall experience is indeed different. While the computer version retains more clarity, the sound on the records gives into the live-wire atmosphere of the actual show—the low tones in particular are noticeably fatter, gloriously smudging into everything else. Along with Pat Mahoney's tireless drumming, Tyler Pope's bass provides a rubbery rhythmic backbone from which the rest of the band is allowed to explode. Murphy was smart to highlight this controlled chaos in this mix, because it offers a distinct, refreshing contrast to LCD's studio records, which are often marked by deadpan dryness along with a watchmaker's attention to detail. Live, though, Murphy and his crew are more excitable and woolier—it's where the frontman can get out of his own self-conscious mind for few hours and get lost in the beats and emotions around him. This feeling is contagious. </p>
<p class=""p1"">And it's found all across <i>The Long Goodbye</i>. Song of the Century contender ""All My Friends"" benefits from edging perilously close to breaking apart at the seams, its smile-to-cry ratio more perfect than ever; ""Time to Get Away"" speeds up and morphs from something slinky into a monolith of funk; ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"" turns into a giddy rush of imagined robots and punk rock synths; Murphy ditches his early stuffed-nose Mark E. Smith affectations as ""Movement"" reminds you that LCD Soundsystem are a better straight-up punk band than almost any other straight-up punk band; <i>45:33</i>'s ""You Can't Hide (Shame on You)"", with singer/comedian Reggie Watts on pitch-perfect guest vocals, lives out its disco-ball dreams with a newfound vividness. Watts' brief spotlight reminded me of his production work on the funk-soul theme song for <a href=""https://buy.louisck.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Louie C.K.</a>'s ""Louie"", a TV show that could easily be subtitled ""New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down"". C.K. and Murphy are both in their mid-40s, both late bloomers, both hyper real and surreal at once, and in many ways ""Louie"" has taken on the affably-fucked-white-guy baton Murphy left behind more than any band. And just as ""Louie"" can hit deep emotional chords within an unlikely milieu of strange sex, stranger doctor's visits, and fart jokes, LCD did the same with dance music, trying to make the beats pump harder because they're always one step closer to the big goodbye. This set highlights that fleeting fleshiness—the paradox of creating something timeless while thousands of people run out of time together.</p>
<p class=""p3"">That headlong rush makes <i>The Long Goodbye </i>more than a cash grab, more than a chintzy white room in a big, overpriced record store with two customers in it. The music is undeniably alive, even though—or perhaps <i>because</i>—the band that made it is all over. Of course, Murphy has always left the door open for an LCD reunion, and the possibility will forever be on the table because the band left at the height of their powers (and because basically every other band has already gotten back together). Talking to <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/james-murphy-on-despacio-lcd-soundsystems-live-album-and-new-music-20131211"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> about reunion offers last year, the frontman said, ""They get shot down before it ever gets to me."" At a time when the nostalgia circuit is on a even-more-depressing downswing, that answer feels right. Even though his recent output—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52598-listen-james-murphy-remixes-david-bowies-love-is-lost/"">a stunning David Bowie remix</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54121-james-murphys-signature-coffee-is-now-available/"">an elite coffee blend</a>, and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51741-watch-james-murphy-in-conversation-about-the-soundsystem-he-designed-with-soulwax/"">50,000-watt custom sound system</a>—hasn't tried to match the impact of LCD in any sense, it's managed to stay true to the LCD ethos by remaining singular and impassioned; while you or I may not get the same high from sipping a perfect cup of coffee as we do from listening to ""All My Friends"" for the thousandth time, it's where James Murphy is at now. And if the band ever steps onstage together again, it'll have to be for a damn good reason. Until then, though, we can still come home to this.</p></div>"|19183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19183-lcd-soundsystem-the-long-goodbye-lcd-soundsystem-live-at-madison-square-garden/|8.1|Ryan Dombal

In 2014 you’re just as likely to read about NASA budget cuts as you are about the upcoming wave of space tourism. Now, it seems, the limitations of our galaxy have been embraced, perhaps as a way to deal with the crushing reality that there might not be much out there after all. Those forthcoming suborbital flights, aimed at non-astronauts, barely go anywhere at all, which speaks volumes for how much the dream of widespread space exploration has been reined in. <i>Space Project</i> is a compilation album released for <a href=""http://recordstoreday.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Record Store Day </a>that links back to the Voyager era, taking recordings made by Voyager I and II of “electromagnetic radiation fluctuations in the magnetosphere of the planets, moons, and large asteroids,” which have been handed over to a variety of artists to construct music around.</p>
<p>As an overall work it’s easy to trace a hint of nostalgia that runs through this record, framing it as a return to the wide-eyed view of space that purposefully ignores the workaday nature of current developments. As such, the lineup mostly feels appropriate, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29667-youth-lagoon/"">Youth Lagoon</a>’s sci-fi blues represented, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6426-jason-pierce/"">Jason Pierce</a> (recording as the Spiritualized Mississippi Space Program) working up his narcotized astronaut persona. The drone-like Voyager recordings are largely inconsequential and often hard to detect—maybe that rumbling sound at the beginning and end of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28973-porcelain-raft/"">Porcelain Raft</a>’s pretty ambient instrumental “Giove” is one of them; perhaps that gentle hum that underpins the quietly menacing “Moonlet” by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29645-zomes/"">Zomes</a> is from some distant planet. It doesn’t matter too much, although it does appear that the crude base material these artists were given has worked to unify <i>Space Project</i> in a way that most compilations can’t reach.</p>
<p>The default mode most of the musicians operate in here is firmly set to “sad, reflective”—as you might expect from a cursory glance at the artists involved. But thought and care has clearly gone into the sequencing, which is another thing that sets it apart from similar ventures. So it goes from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteaus</a>-like lullaby of the <a href=""http://theholydrugcouple.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Holydrug Couple</a>’s “Amphitrites Lost”, through a piano-bar-at-the-end-of-the-world lament (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27928-blues-control/"">Blues Control</a>’s “Blues Danube”), and ends with a couple of typically pristine <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a> affiliated acts (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29485-benoit-sergio/"">Benoit &amp; Sergio</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30888-larry-gus/"">Larry Gus</a>). It’s impressive how the bridges between worlds never feel like a stretch—it can effortlessly get to Gus’s itchy “Sphere of lo (for Georg Cantor)” from the elegance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Beach House</a>’s minimal “Saturn Song”, which is positioned just a handful of songs before. The Beach House track works around a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKE3FSPJu-4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Major Tom</a>-esque lyric about being “out on my own”, adding to the overall tone of space race nostalgia.</p>
<p>Despite having a satisfying arc that gently bends through it, there are a few moments where <i>Space Project</i> doesn’t solidify as a whole. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"">Jesu</a>’s “Song of Earth” sounds like something they could have written in their sleep, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30651-anna-meredith/"">Anna Meredith</a>’s “Miranda” is slightly too imposing, working better as a standalone piece that takes hard, overlapping electronics and builds them to a dizzy crescendo. Such is the nature of the multi-artist compilation album—largely an imperfect concept that makes you to sift through the bad in order to get to the good, and to criticize it for being that way feels like a particularly pointless exercise. Still, this one works better than most, not necessarily because of the source material that was a requisite to entry, but more because the concept clearly triggered some kind of sentimental reflex in most of the artists involved. This might be a last gasp for space age retro-nostalgia before that concept begins to feel retro in itself; if so, it’s a decent way to go out.</p></div>"|19271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19271-space-project/|6.5|Nick Neyland

<p>His new record, <i>Word O.K.</i>, is an album of post-modern rap, a self-conscious, fourth-wall-breaking word collage that parodies hip-hop’s grand narratives even as it gleefully fulfills them.

The ambition showcased on <i>Word O.K.</i> makes for a more fluid project than anything that Vazquez has come out with since 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16199-heems-nehru-jackets-kool-ad-the-palm-wine-drinkard/""><i>The Palm Wine Drinkard</i></a>, but it also dials down the enigmatic quality of his recent work. He had once committed to the “anything goes” sensibility of his music, but now Vasquez is hedging his bets, unsure of whether or not to shoulder the mantle of contributing seriously to the genre he so clearly loves.</p>
<p>Vasquez's love of rap and wordplay, if nothing else, is what comes through strongest on <i>Word O.K.</i>: as he says early on, he “Speaks the English language/ That's the slang I learned to bang with/ If I came from Denmark then I’d probably freak the Danish.”  It’d be hard to come up with another rapper who takes such simple joy in rhyme, and Vazquez remains a pure pleasure to hear flipping words, even as he mocks his own ability to do so.  Several times throughout the record he throws shade at his own rapping, noting his semi-amateur status (‘“Sometimes I get paid to record…other times I do it for free”) and lack of concrete subject matter (“This is just me bullshittin, I ain't got shit to say”).  Most of the tension on the record comes from the difference between that attitude and sentiments like the one on “Naughty by Nature”, on which Vazquez claims to “Just want to write real raps/ Like, tell ‘em how you feel raps,"" before undermining himself again by describing a boatload of other jokey types of raps that he’d like to write.</p>
<p>Throwing this many words at a canvas typically makes for interesting material, and on <i>Word O.K. </i>Vasquez occasionally says something interesting. On the seven-minute exploration “Life and Time”, he talks about the pain that comes with seeing misery in the world, shrugging “What can one man do?” before self-correcting: “I don’t know, probably a lot.” It’s a thought-provoking questioning of the artist’s priorities. Unfortunately, as with so many other similar sentiments on this record, there’s no follow-through, as the train of thought is abandoned as soon as it arrives.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Word O.K.</i> is held together by longtime collaborator Amaze 88's beats, as well as production from Mike Finito and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi"">Toro Y Moi</a>'s Chaz Bundick; the latter's throwback hip-hop contributions to “The Front”, especially, helps the song stand apart as one of the record's most diverting cuts. For his part, Amaze comes through, as his blissed-out West Coast loops on “Open Letter,” “Life and Time”, and the title track provide firm foundations for Vazquez's random blocks of thought.</p>
<p><i>Word O.K.</i> is compelling art, but it's also weightless, shifting, defiant music that rejects the listener’s ability to gain something from it. Since he's cloaked his more serious self in an armor of dense wordplay, it’s difficult to determine whether Vasquez has a goal other than throwing words on wax and seeing what sticks, a method that shields him from his own seriousness and prevents him from further exploring bigger ideas.</p></div>"|19272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19272-kool-ad-word-ok/|6.7|Jonah Bromwich

In the first dozen years of the Miami band’s existence, they burned through <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Floor/44108"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a dozen members</a>. They swapped out rhythm sections and shifted between trio and quartet lineups, as though their thick but quick mix of sludge metal and pop structures cracked the will of any new additions. As legend has it, that’s one of the reasons guitarists Steve Brooks and Anthony Vialon drastically dropped the tunings of their instruments. Who needs a fourth wheel when you’ve got 12 strings tuned to the introductory letters of the alphabet? It’s a probable cause of their single-and-split-prone output, too. Between 1992 and 2004, the band released more than a dozen short shots but only one full-length, a self-titled 2002 stomper that was fine but never quite captured the band’s intensity <i>and</i> addictiveness. It would take Brooks’ post-Floor crew, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a>, to do that—particularly on their 2008 album <i>Meanderthal</i> and its irrepressible <i>Songs for Singles</i> chaser.</p>
<p>When Floor reunited in 2010, then, it seemed safe to assume that the jumpstarted band would be a short-lived nostalgia trip. In 2009, <a href=""https://www.roboticempire.com/floor-below-beyond-less-than-200-box-sets-left-a-possible-cd-version/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robotic Empire had released a gargantuan box set</a> collecting Floor’s entire scattered discography; it came loaded with 10 LPs, a single, and eight CDs. The next year, Floor played several shows, including bills in which they’d shift drummers so as to offer timeline-correct renditions of early material. For the next three years, Floor continued to tour sporadically. But the entire idea seemed noncommittal. Brooks was busy with Torche, after all, as their mix of Jawbox hooks and Eyehategod volume had found unlikely crossover reception. As late as 2012, he confirmed the spare-time aspect <a href=""http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2012/07/torche_steve_brooks_interview_305_fest_miami.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in an interview</a>: “I consider it a side project at the moment. If I have the time to focus on new Floor material, it will happen. In the meantime, we play shows from time to time for fun.”</p>
<p>But the same trio that made that 2002 album has returned with <i>Oblation</i>, only Floor’s second LP in more than two decades. Brooks and Vialon still wield those earth-roar guitars, and drummer Henry Wilson shifts capably between punchy up-tempo bursts and browbeating-and-slow doom-pop. <i>Oblation </i>is, at the very least, the best of both Floor albums. It’s more dynamic than its predecessor, relative to volume and variety, and Kurt Ballou’s work behind the mixing board gives <i>Oblation</i> the kind of depth that Floor forever lacked on tape. Brooks makes some compelling lyrical choices, including his tale of Don Quixote’s sidekick horse during the racing “Rocinante” and the man-on-man/love-hate-love lunge “New Man”.</p>
<p>There are some surprising structures here, too. Brooks harmonizes perfectly with Wilson’s girlfriend, Melissa Friedman, during the laidback “Homegoings and Transitions”, a tune she wrote. And though Floor kept things dense and compact during their heyday (7"" singles end quickly, after all), the trio nears the eight-minute mark for “Sign of Aeth”. They cycle through a sliding, smoky preamble and creep through some very moody blues; the guitars peel away from one another in oddly psychedelic patterns, as though the drugs suddenly work for Floor in very different ways. And on closer “Forever Still”, Brooks calms his generally exclamatory voice, delivering every verse in a multi-tracked monotone. He subtly curves the words into one of the record’s best melodies.</p>
<p>As its name implies, however, <i>Oblation</i> often feels like a curtsy to Floor’s own legacy, an attempt to fortify the influence and ideal of the band’s sludge-pop. The down-tuned tumult begins to turn into a gauntlet of drudgery, where structures and sounds string into blurs. Though they’re exciting in isolation, great tunes like “War Party”, “Sister Sophia”, and “Find Away” begin to register as redundant. Instability once fueled Floor; they’ve now recorded two albums (albeit separated by more than a decade) with the same lineup, and the consistency can start to scan like a rut. But that’s almost always the trouble with reunion records, isn’t it, especially for bands whose signature sound has become a calling card for successors? The unfamiliar might hear <i>Oblation</i> and assume that these three dudes are very big Torche fans. However illogical that may be, there’s a grain of truth to the joke: Brooks relaunched an old band that, more often than not, sounds like a working model of his more popular current one.</p>
<p>Though <i>Oblation</i> feels unnecessary now, it may prove to be a requisite transition for Floor, a recapitulation of the back catalog that clears the way for something more. There are glimmers here not only of the band that they <i>were </i>but also suggestions of what they could become, whether it’s the ecstatic, feedback-inducing instrumentalists of “The Quill” or the downcast pop-rock renderers of “Forever Still”. In this way, the record recalls <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_of_Conformity_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Corrosion of Conformity’s self-titled 2012 return</a>, released by the similarly important Candlelight. That album reunited the trio responsible for the band’s pivotal 1985 album <i>Animosity</i> after years of similar retrospective shows. By quickly summarizing most everything the band had ever done in a new set of songs, <i>Corrosion of Conformity </i>worked in much the same way as <i>Oblation</i>. Both albums suggested that these units, despite the turbulent past of the brand, had more to give. “Begin tomorrow/ Be above it/ Why change at all?” Brooks sings on the opening title track, his voice lost in the deep-space echo that’s now so emblematic of Torche. Well, because we, like you, have been here before.</p></div>"|19162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19162-floor-oblation/|7.0|Grayson Haver Currin

It’s the fault line on top of which TEEN’s art rock dance party is built. When she rumbles, the band (comprised of sisters Lizzie and Katherine on keys and drums, and newcomer Boshra AlSaadi on bass) rumbles; when she’s calm, they ease into their open-hearted groove. It’s a powerful arrow to keep in their quiver, even if their aim isn’t always true.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The Way and Color </i><span>is stuffed with chugging synthesizers, gristly bass lines, braying horns, and high harmonies layered into multi-movement suites that sometimes feel like they’ve been crafted out of the ashes of a handful of songs. Despite the commotion, there are a few songs that assemble into something thrilling. Teeny huffs and puffs and nearly collapses on “Rose 4 U” before pausing to patiently build a triumphant peroration, and while “Breathe Low &amp; Deep”’s explicitly proggy take on R&amp;B doesn’t snap as tightly as Dirty Projectors might, it still swells to a satisfyingly spacey outro. At the same time, the most memorable track, “Tied Up Tied Down”, is the shortest one (not counting the wispy and wholly unnecessary instrumental, “Voices”) and the most conceptually straightforward. Reviewing their debut album, Pitchfork’s Eric Harvey wrote that “a seasoned producer could strategically shave 20 minutes off the album while losing little."" Here, they've at least improved to just 10 extraneous, probably cut-worthy minutes. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>TEEN say they’re inspired by Erykah Badu and D’Angelo, and the songs on </span><i>The Way and Color</i><span> address a similar kind of sinewy, sometimes sinister sexuality where bodies don't quite know what to do with each other. But their attempt to slink around doesn’t carry the same comfort level; it sometimes sounds as though the band, while playing, is repeating a mantra of “Be cool, be cool” inside their heads, infusing everything with a level of stiffness. There’s a song called “Toi Toi Toi” that borrows its title from the opera, where “toi toi toi” is said in the same way as “break a leg.” The Liebersons come from opera stock: </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/arts/music/peter-lieberson-64-composer-inspired-by-buddhism-dies.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>their late father</span></a><span>, Peter Lieberson, was an acclaimed composer, and </span><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/25/060925crmu_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>their late stepmother</span></a><span>, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, was a well respected mezzo-soprano.

No one since has sounded quite like Life Without Buildings, and to even try would miss the point. Their music valued invention, risk, wonder, imagination, and—perhaps above all other virtues—fun. And like very few bands, they were smart enough to walk away as soon as the fun stopped. ""When the band began of course none of us really thought anyone would be interested, so there wasn't anything at stake,"" guitarist Robert Johnston recalled about a decade after their amicable break-up. ""For Sue, I think it turned from a laugh into being a commitment she'd never signed up for."" Lucky for us, though, that laugh was caught and forever immortalized on tape.</p>
<p>Released on Rough Trade's Tugboat imprint in 2001, <i>Any Other City</i> is Life Without Buildings' only proper record. (There's also the very good live album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10535-live-at-the-annandale-hotel/""><i>Live at the Annandale</i></a>, which was released in 2007, a few years after the band broke up.) It came out to mild hype but has grown to be a cult favorite in the years since, its reputation all the more storied and elusive because the CD went out of print and it has never been available on vinyl in the U.S. until now. That the band has yet to capitalize on the reunion show/deluxe-reissue trend keeps with the lack of careerist tendencies that defined its entire run. There's a story that, in 2001 at what would end up being the Strokes' first-ever headlining show in London, Life Without Buildings got bumped down to a supporting act at the last minute. Even if it's apocryphal, I suspect this tale gets repeated by fans so often because it cements LWB's underdog status—their indifference about jumping through the hoops that would have made them the Next Big Thing and the inability of most people to appreciate them in their time. Reviews of <i>Any Other City</i> were either breathless raves or pans that questioned the sanity of anyone who could listen to it in full. ""I remember one [review] that said only mad people could like us,"" drummer Will Bradley said years later. ""I was happy with that. Not long afterwards, we seemed to get a lot of guys coming to our gigs with fresh head wounds, like unstitched lobotomy scars.""</p>
<p>The most distinct (or to those who prefer the safety of convention, the ""maddest"") part of Life Without Buildings' sound is Tompkins' singing, which lands somewhere between scatting, talking, and speaking in tongues. ""No details, but I'm gonna <i>persuade you</i>!"" she insists with electric charisma in the record's first seconds, and opening-line mission statements do not get much truer than that; all you'll want to do for the next 45 minutes is follow her blindly, even when you don't know where the hell she's headed. To Tompkins, language is bubblegum—something exhilaratingly sugary to chomp, crack, and stretch between her fingers. In that opening song, ""P.S. Exclusive"", she repeats the phrase ""the right stuff"" 44 times, but it's too dynamic to ever grow repetitive; it's almost like she's playing a game with herself to see all the different ways she can pronounce it.</p>
<p>Tompkins' lyrics often resemble collages. Familiar words are stammered, stuttered, and chopped up until they sound disorienting and strange—which is a sensibility that carries over to the visual art she's been making since she left the band. (A line from the <a href=""http://glasgowinternational.org/artists/sue-tompkins/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">program</a> of one of her recent gallery shows could easily double as a description of a Life Without Buildings song: ""Through her typed and spoken works she represents snatches of material gleaned from the everyday, distorting meaning by metering their arrangement and delivery."") She delights in found phrases, homophones, and the serendipity misunderstanding. In fan favorite ""The Leanover"", she chants ""If I lose ya, if I lose ya, if I lose ya in the street"" enough for it to start sounding like ""if Illusion Street."" Or something else entirely. On <a href=""http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858651104/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the song's entry on SongMeanings.net</a>, there is a long comment written by someone who was once convinced that she was saying ""a Fallujan street"" and that the song was about the Iraq War. Although this theory has been debunked, I have no doubt that this poetic misunderstanding would delight Sue Tompkins.</p>
<p>For all its art-rock leanings, <i>Any Other City</i> never feels too self-indulgent. A lot of this has to do with the interplay between Tompkins' freewheeling style and the dependable (though wonderfully crooked) backbone provided by Johnston, Bradley, and bassist Chris Evans. Inspired by Pittsburgh math-rock heroes Don Caballero, Life Without Buildings were first an instrumental band before they convinced their art-school friend Tompkins to meld her spoken-word poetry with their antic, skittering sound. (Even the band itself is a kind of collage.) Sometimes the disconnect in their sensibilities is a little <i>too</i> wide (the tonal palette of ""Young Offenders"", the most overtly Don Caballero-esque, is a bit too dull for Tompkins' bold, primary-color exclamations), but more often it creates a novel and unique energy. One of the band's signature songs is ""New Town"", in which Johnston's quiet, steadily chugging riff and Bradley's muted beat suddenly explode alongside Tompkins' vocals in the chorus. ""Looking in your eyes/ <i>I'm</i> <i>looking in your eyes!</i>"" she shouts, as combative as she is jubilant, issuing these words like a challenge for everybody else to look, live, and love a little bit more emphatically. </p>
<p>The reissue mostly leaves the original record to speak for itself. The only extra included here is a 7"" containing the more ramshackle original versions of ""The Leanover"" and ""New Town"", which are interesting because they let you hear Tompkins working out phrasings and pronunciations she'd sharpen on the record. When <i>Any Other City </i>came out, most people assumed her vocals were heavily improvised, but as the spot-on renditions replicated on <i>Live at the Annandale Hotel</i> proved, they're actually carefully metered and display an extraordinary sense of rhythm. Life Without Buildings were most impressive—and influential—in the way they balanced sheer technical skill with a sense of ecstatic playfulness, which is a sensibility carried on after them by bands like Ponytail, Perfect Pussy, Marnie Stern, Los Campesinos!, and more. Hopefully this reissue will add more names to that list.</p>
<p>It's hard to talk about Tompkins' vocals without using the word ""childlike"", which is too often an annoying cliché people use to infantilize female vocalists and refrain from taking them seriously. (Many of the 2001 pans of <i>Any Other City </i>are tainted with sexism; in one baffling comparison, <a href=""http://www.nme.com/reviews/life-without-buildings/4076"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an <i>NME</i> reviewer</a> faulted Tompkins for not sounding like Whitney Houston.) Here, though, it's apt. This record is all about the wild wisdom of youth; here are four musicians who have managed to recreate that sense of wonder and invention and play that most people (and, let’s face it, bands) lose when they get older. “Look around!” Tompkins insists. “Just information in the leaves, in the leaves, <i>in the leaves</i>!” The phrasing is a little awkward, like an expression stammered out before you knew the proper rules of grammar, or a big word uttered before you knew how to pronounce it right. But who cares. If the sound doesn’t exist, she seems to be saying, invent it. Which is exactly what Life Without Buildings did.</p></div>"|19181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19181-life-without-buildings-any-other-city/|8.7|Lindsay Zoladz

A few were cohots from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6426-jason-pierce/"">Jason Pierce</a>’s days in Spacemen 3 (Will Carruthers, Mark Refoy, Jon Mattock); one is a former lover who inspired some of Pierce’s material (Kate Radley); and others such as Ray Dickaty (<a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Moonshake"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moonshake</a>), Thighpaulsandra (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/827-julian-cope/"">Julian Cope</a>), and John Coxon (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3919-spring-heel-jack/"">Spring Heel Jack</a>) were notable for their work elsewhere. John Colpitts, aka Kid Millions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"">Oneida</a>, came on board in the band’s recent history, although it’s not yet clear if he’s passing through or is a permanent fixture in the lineup. Either way, he’s clearly formed a firm bond with Pierce, helping bring Spiritualized to a tiny <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8YqKT05Zw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn venue</a> that he’s been a fundamental part of over the years, and taking time out of the tour to promote <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16503-sweet-heart-sweet-light/""><i>Sweet Heart Sweet Light</i></a> to perform an improv set with the singer at Le Poisson Rouge in New York in September 2013.</p>
<p>This release, a limited edition <a href=""http://www.recordstoreday.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Record Store Day</a> pressing that spreads four songs over a 12"" and an accompanying 7"", documents the show. It bridges the pair’s dueling fondness for minimalism and chaos, with the last two Oneida albums, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15490-absolute-ii/""><i>Absolute II</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17304-a-list-of-the-burning-mountains/""><i>A List of the Burning Mountains</i></a>, useful as reference points for where Millions found a point of intersection for those tendencies. Pierce’s experiments with breaking free of song structure have been similarly inspired—the 2006 album <a href=""http://youtu.be/l-vZbkg9A1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Guitar Loops</i></a> is an underrated record in his canon—but here both he and Millions find a space to operate in that’s only fleetingly similar to their output elsewhere. Opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54052-listen-spiritualizeds-j-spaceman-and-oneidas-kid-millions-share-24-minute-misha-from-collab-album/"">“Misha”</a> initially works as a piece that provides space for them to feel each other out, with Pierce gently tapping out repeating piano motifs before switching to guitar. The sense of anticipation and control is key, with the the duo beautifully building to nowhere in particular, sometimes letting a looseness take hold of the playing, at other times coming close to something resembling structure.</p>
<p>If there’s a harmony to “Misha”, it’s not a place Pierce and Millions return to much for the remainder of this performance. Mostly they sound like warring factions, actively agitating one another. At one point during “New York” Pierce fires off a squall of guitar laced in fuzz, only for Millions to respond with a barrage of drumming that resembles a heap of scaffolding collapsing into the sidewalk. At those points Pierce’s guitar playing sometimes resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>’s work when he’s firmly in the abstract—Young’s 1991 album <i>Arc</i>, a collation of feedback and guitar noise gathered from live recordings, largely thought to be inspired by his then-touring partners <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>—is a useful comparison piece for the places Pierce lands in here. When he reaches for chaos in Spiritualized it’s usually more dense than this. If the breakdown section of “Cop Shoot Cop” is like the apocalypse violently raining down on you, this record’s “London” is a slow, unconscious crawl into oblivion.</p>
<p>The circular motions Pierce experimented with on <i>Guitar Loops</i> are reflected on “Han”, which is built around a robo-loop that the two use as a focal point to extract a maelstrom of noise from one another. It’s the point where Pierce feels at his most free, clouding Millions in billows of wah-wah guitar, steering in waves of calm via husks of light feedback, and throwing in power chords to close it out in an exalted state. Something that elevates this recording is the sense of release that flows throughout, no doubt caused by it being the work of two musicians locked into the touring cycle, playing the same songs night after night. Here, Pierce and Millions step out of the machine for a while and simply let rip.

With recent signee <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31721-isaiah-rashad/"">Isaiah Rashad</a>, the label has kept it up, presenting an assured artist in the lineage of the South's great thinking-man's MCs.<br/><br/>But the ability, or perhaps desire, to be understood immediately eludes TDE's newest artist SZA, the first woman and R&amp;B singer to sign to the label. Her debut album <i>Z</i> plays out like a fractured memory you struggle to piece together fully: there are shards of clarity, but only that. Of course, not every album needs to be completely digestible, but <i>Z</i> is not the sort of mysteriously seductive record that reveals itself over time. Instead, it has walls that are tough, if not impossible, to punch through, making for an unnecessarily frustrating listen that too often feels guarded.<br/><br/>It <i>is</i> clear that SZA knows precisely what she wants her music to sound like: <i>Z</i> is essentially a chillwave album, every song resting softly on a bed of gauzy keyboard tones as muffled guitar figures and teetering drum patterns float by like dust in the sunlight. The results sound less weird than that description implies, since plenty of current R&amp;B music folds back towards the same slumbering fog that defined chillwave. But very little chillwave featured female vocals—unless you include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Beach House</a> (previously sampled by Lamar, natch), spiritual ancestors of SZA whose DNA also courses through <i>Z</i>. A female R&amp;B singer's version of a chillwave album could be both novel and contemporary if executed well, but <i>Z</i> is deeply flawed.<br/><br/><i>Z</i>'s biggest problem is that, despite choosing a sound that is soft and somnolent, SZA is too often overpowered by the music. The album is a glimmering swirl, but her voice gets lost. In a literal sense, it can be hard to hear her: on tracks like ""Warm Winds"", ""Shattered Ring"", and ""Omega"", her vocals are as ethereal as the beat, as entire songs dissipate into a mist. It's also impossible to get a sense for who she is. What is SZA going through? What has she been through? Unfortunately, <i>Z</i> does not reveal the answers to these questions, cutting against both the nature of her label and R&amp;B as a genre.</p>
<p>The album opens up when SZA does, but that happens only in slices: the offhand aside of ""Your skin tastes like brussels sprouts, I swear"" on ""Ur"", the muttered plea of ""Do you want to know me?"" on the soulful ""Child's Play"", or the bracing humor of ""Bumping that Jadakiss is dangerous for your sanity"" on ""Shattered Ring."" ""HiiiJack,"" produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"">Toro y Moi</a>, is the only time the album blossoms into a real, affecting chorus: ""Sometimes I keep you in my mind/ Sometimes I let you go up high/ I'm using everything I find/ Do anything to keep you tied up."" Here, SZA comes from an identifiable, relatable place, making a strong—and maybe even irrational—statement of devotion. With a beat that is both off-kilter and soothing and a chorus that floats away slowly like an ascendant balloon, it's a song so good that more like it could have pried <i>Z</i> all the way open. But that power rests solely with SZA, and hopefully she'll harness it on whatever comes next.</p></div>"|19278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19278-sza-z/|5.9|Jordan Sargent

This is a selection of musics that, in part, document people learning to party with new technologies, sounding sometimes like the A/V club's impression of a really hot time. Banks makes music that stands at the intersection of house, hip-hop, and R&amp;B, but it doesn't sound like those awkward, searching records he spun in part because he's from a generation of producers who are very, <i>very</i> comfortable with technology. On <i>Yahoo or the Highway</i>, his debut album, he takes that old electro sound and smooths it out—hiding the seams, waxing the hood—resulting in a gleaming, hi-fidelity boogie that feels very modern.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Yahoo or the Highway</i> follows a series of EPs for fashionable labels such as the Mad Decent-affiliated Jeffree's and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28691-slugabed/"">Slugabed</a>'s Activia Benz. Last year's <i>Only Built for Neon Nights </i>EP established Banks, alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31225-the-range/"">the Range</a>, as one of the two most promising acts on Brighton's Donky Pitch label. Because Banks' music is bright and informed by hip-hop—but also because he's Scottish—he is frequently compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a>. Banks shares their maximalist sparkle, but his music isn't as exploratory or massive. It's also, crucially, more lighthearted, possibly because when Banks claims his tracks draw from hip-hop, he's talking about Melle Mel instead of Lex Luger.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Yahoo</i> is digital music: forged by modern technology, it reflects the omnivorousness and immediacy spending time online. Banks, helpfully, is the kind of internet-clever that leads to plenty of #wordplay: ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16483-if-loving-u-is-wrong-i-dont-want-to-be-wrong-12-edit/"">If Loving You Is Wrong, I Don't Want to Be Wrong</a>"", ""Summer Jorts (Some Cats Still Do)"" and ""Sharks Sad Mouth in the 1st Pic"" all feature as track titles. His artwork is peppered with everything from <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Lockah-Please-Lockah-Dont-Hurt-Em/release/4470089"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ninja Turtles</a> to the type of hyperreal photo-illustrations (see above) found on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16768-classical-curves/"">recent Night Slugs releases</a>. While it contains plenty of references, <i>Yahoo</i> is not nostalgic for its influences in the same way CGI is not nostalgic for old special effects—this is just the way things are done now.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Yahoo</i> is so carefree and unconcerned that its occasional busyness—the crisscrossing melodies of ""Ayyo Tricknology"", the motorik, training-montage soundtrack that is ""Every Song Was About U""—is ephemeral and easily brushed off. Banks succeeds when he paints in bold strokes. The confident breeziness of ""If Loving U"" moves in and out of a piano house breakdown; the tart lightness of opener ""A Face Only Another Could Love"" rolls out the red carpet for <i>Yahoo</i>'s ballsiest bassline. The stuttering ""Summer Jorts"" is the sound of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1835-the-go-team/"">Go! Team</a>'s cheerleading, sampledelic anthem ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC128euLMwM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ladyflash</a>"" rendered by someone who found if too stodgy and old-school.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Yahoo</i> is uncool in a comforting way, especially given the circles these tracks travel in: it's easy to imagine <i>Glass Swords</i> and <i>TNGHT</i> teasing it in the cafeteria. Its nowness is lived-in and casual, a byproduct rather than a statement. But rarely does effusive, whimsical music get the widescreen treatment. All of this bombast and glitter in the service of some knobby basslines and jokes about jean shorts: some cats still do, I guess.</p></div>"|19216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19216-lockah-yahoo-or-the-highway/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

The descriptor likely triggers some immediate ideas their Cali predecessors embedded in our consciousness, few of which are consistent with each other but all aligning to create a theoretical Golden State: the guitars are situated somewhere between the beach and the garage, and there's ""surf's up"" tremolo riffing played with the berzerker energy that powers the Bay Area. It's pop too, if not necessarily pop-punk<i>—</i>the kind you could hear on Lookout! or Plague Vendor’s home, Epitaph. That covers a </span><span>lot </span><span>of ground geographically and stylistically, and </span><i>Free To Eat </i><span>does as well, showing a lot of civic pride even if Plague Vendor’s music is pretty handy for joyously loathing wherever you happen to be. </span></p>
<p>The band's a quartet in their early 20s from Whittier, an exurb about 20 miles outside of Los Angeles that truly earns a reputation as ""conservative""<i>—</i>it gave us George Allen and Richard Nixon. It's the kind of stultifying, relatively comfortable place that drives a lot of bored kids to the dark arts and Plague Vendor dabble in all kinds of gothic aesthetics<i>—</i>there's Brandon Blaine's possessed vocals, the eyeliner-streaked anthems of early AFI, and the Mexican folklore from which they get their name. But Plague Vendor are more interested in creating their own aura<i>—</i>even more so than the song on <i>Free to Eat</i> that bears their own name, single “Breakdance on Broken Glass” is a statement of purpose, indulging in “Immigrant Song” and “We’re An American Band”-style mythmaking (“Your daughters love our style/ Every slaughter ends with a smile”). If “voodoo-punk” is a real subgenre, <i>Free to Eat</i> is trying to be a definitive document.</p>
<p><i>Free to Eat</i> is a blast, and its album cover was chosen wisely: Blaine is in the center of the picture, only outside the frame because he’s lunging out of it. He deadpans like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6554-mark-e-smith/"">Mark E. Smith</a> over bucking, neck-snapping riffs on “Black Sap Scriptures” and a minute later, manages a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">Jack White</a> yawp on “Cursed Love, Hexed Lust”, bedeviled and agitated over the wiles of a preacher’s daughter<i>—</i>at least until the double-time thrash where he scat-raps like Anthony Kiedis with his sock on fire. It’s certainly cartoonish and caricatured, but the carnality is welcome; there hasn’t been much space for sex in punk of late, carnal drives either eliminated by scolding stoics or used as a platform to spark academic and political debate.</p>
<p>While Blaine’s imagination is given plenty of space to roam, Plague Vendor’s framework is small <i>—</i>small town, small, cramped shows, small, cramped album. <i>Free to Eat</i>’s ten tracks clock in at about 18 minutes, most of which are tied up in the aforementioned highlights; the balance is given to one-minute, fast-twitch exertions which don’t leave much of an impression beyond being samplers for their live show. Still, it’s all fun and all hooks, the latter in a literal sense—the musical elements are entirely sharp and metallic, with guitars that sound like they’re emitting steel shavings, jangly tambourine and a piercing, inhuman shriek in the beginning of “My Tongue is So Treacherous.”  </p>
<p>As referential as <i>Free To Eat</i> can be on its own, there are times when a band notes an influence that completely changes your perception of it; Plague Vendor’s favorite band is indeed one from California, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars"">Liars</a> are only recent transplants and they haven’t been called “punk” in over a decade.  You can hear the connection<i>—</i>the confrontational frontman, the obsession with the occult, the physicality of their live performances. More importantly, even the best California punk bands tended to devolve into formula after a few albums; if they’re true to the ideals of their role models, Plague Vendor could end up somewhere even more strange and exciting next time out.</p></div>"|19213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19213-plague-vendor-free-to-eat/|7.1|Ian Cohen

Armand Van Helden and A-Trak have spent a large part of this decade acting as big-box dance music's merry pranksters, following their clown-nosed muses to the most illogically comical endpoints. In their music videos, the duo have <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhhnUTNror8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">acted as whistle-prone barbers</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWhtcU4-xAM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">drank each other's milkshakes</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVRDYTyWHnk&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">become literal dickheads</a>; after <a href=""http://cdn.idolator.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/25/duck-sauce-governors-ball-600x450.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bringing their bomber jacket-befitted inflatable mascot to New York City's Governor's Ball festival in 2012</a>, they set their creation floating down the East River during the following year's installment of the festival—just for laughs.</p>
<p>While introducing Duck Sauce's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52823-duck-sauce-share-download-and-cassette-of-duck-tape-their-bbc-essential-mix/"">loopy entry in BBC's Essential Mix series</a>, Armand Van Helden described the originals-heavy portion of the two-hour mix as ""songs we tried shopping to George Michael, Celine Dion, Billy Joel, and were all declined""; loaded with stoner-friendly sampledelia, the end result resembled something the Avalanches would've whipped up if they binged on breakfast burritos and after-hours basic cable.</p>
<p>""There’s nothing serious about Duck Sauce—nothing,"" said A-Trak (real name <span>Alain Macklovitch) </span>when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9337-duck-sauce/"">I interviewed</a> him and Van Helden earlier this year. The project has indeed come across as a lackadaisical concern for the two veteran producers, releasing roughly a single a year over the past six years and devoting the rest of their shared effort to crowd-pleasing live performances on the festival circuit. The pair liken their biggest hit to date, the giddily repetitive ""Barbra Streisand"", to the Champs' ""Tequila Song""—""Just a riff and a word""—and to this point Duck Sauce have come across as a novelty concern, a singles project that excels at penetrating the zeitgeist.</p>
<p>Which is fine; dance music thrives as a singles-focused culture, and even with <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/edm-record-labels-sell-dance-music/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the current micro-boom in artist-focused albums</a> as a byproduct of the EDM money pit, smart money was not on the guys with the inflatable duck releasing a satisfying full-length. So the punchline to Duck Sauce's greatest <a href=""http://comedycentral.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/kroll_show/video/krollshow_106_too_much_tuna640x360.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prank</a> yet is that they've gone ahead and done exactly that. <i>Quack</i>, Duck Sauce's proper debut, is reverential to the music of A-Trak and Van Helden's past—disco's ecstatic glide, house music's hedonistic heartbeat, the good-natured irreverence of classic hip-hop—while sounding totally refreshing amongst its contemporaries. The closest thing here to what some would refer to as ""EDM"" is the squeaky Dutch house of ""It's You"", which rests its central melody on, of all things, a sped-up sample of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPt7hIDlW38"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a goddamn doo-wop song.</a></p>
<p>If Daft Punk's <i>Random Access Memories</i> found the robots paying tribute to the music that shaped their lives, then <i>Quack</i> is Duck Sauce paying tribute to Daft Punk themselves, along with other French Touch luminaries like Alan Braxe, Fred Falke, and Etienne de Crécy. A-Trak and Van Helden liberally apply the glowing synths and filter-heavy textures of those Gallic auteurs throughout <i>Quack</i>, the entire thing brushed with the type of stupid-smart goofiness not seen since Fatboy Slim's big-beat heyday. Bemoan festival-ready dance music as you wish, but the genre's greatest malady in 2014 is that many of its practitioners sound like they're trying <i>too</i> hard to have fun; Duck Sauce bring the party without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Expertly playing to its creators' strengths—Van Helden's ability to hardwire hip-hop breaks and house motifs, A-Trak's turntablist skill and crate-digging know-how—<i>Quack</i> operates at one intense speed and never lets up, from the heavy thump that kicks open ""Chariots of the Gods"" to ""Time Waits for No-One""'s stadium-minded '80s rock fixations. Subtlety is non-existent. The secret to <i>Quack</i>'s success, then, is how loud it <i>isn't</i>: the record is mastered with finesse, an impressive studio sheen that wraps even the most hard-hitting of A-Trak and Van Helden's creations in a down comforter. Disco-pop auteurs Chromeo pitch in on various tasks throughout the album—vocalist Dave Macklovitch, brother of Alain, sings lead on ""Everyone"" under the goofball alias Teddy Toothpick—and <i>Quack</i> frequently bears the type of big-money studio wizardry that the perpetually underestimated Chromeo are known for.</p>
<p>At 54 minutes long, <i>Quack</i> isn't completely user-friendly as a front-to-back listening experience (shave two minutes off of every song and you'd have a tighter album that nonetheless would lose its functionality as a collection of DJ tools) but A-Trak and Van Helden deploy a few tricks to avoid inducing listener fatigue. Once or twice, they veer close to repetition for repetition's sake—the vocal drops and cyclical strings of ""Charlie Chazz &amp; Rappin Ralph"" wear out their welcome halfway into the tune's five-minute length—but elsewhere they exhibit an impressive sense of patience. Leaning hard on samples from THP Orchestra's ""Good to Me"", the hook on ""Goody Two Shoes"" is almost impossibly indulgent to the point where it risks inducing diabetic shock; Duck Sauce know this, tempering the song's initial burst with a placid midsection of hand drums and lazer synths before bringing back the chorus in a way that triggers an intoxicating release. Even ""Barbra Streisand"", placed in the midst of <i>Quack</i>'s world-beating final third, ebbs and flows with added flourishes (check the steel drum-sounding tones less than a minute in) to avoid reaching peak monotonousness.</p>
<p>The other ace up <i>Quack</i>'s sleeve is its skits. I know, I know—skits on albums are rarely funny, and their success more often than not relies on the listener's sense of humor, and everyone's definition of what's ""funny"" is as specific as snowflake architecture. Regardless, A-Trak and Van Helden, along with a cast of wiseguys that range from viral comedian the Fat Jew to Lord Sear from radio DJs Stretch &amp; Bobbito's classic NYC hip-hop show, are pretty good at busting your gut, providing that your gut has a high tolerance for quacking noises and jokes about smelly underwear. They send up comparison-obsessed music nerds (""It’s sort of Mel Gibson meets ancient aliens""), Spanish-language radio shows, and Wu-Tang Clan's classic torture skit from ""Method Man"", the latter in which a pitched-down A-Trak and Van Helden promise to ""Take you to a yoga ashram and shit, in fuckin’ Toronto."" </p>
<p>A few skits on <i>Quack</i> (the Fat Jew's prank phone call to a Chinese restaurant at the end of ""Ring Me"", the club-and-concert-calendar radio-promo spoof tacked on to ""NRG"") will undoubtedly trigger nostalgic reactions from anyone who's spent the majority of their lives in the tri-state area that surrounds New York City, and that's the point. A-Trak and Van Helden are both NYC denizens—the latter's legacy is practically cemented as one of many who shaped and added vibrancy to the city's dance culture—and even if they don't quite hit the heights of the A-Trak-name-checked influence of Beastie Boys' <i>Paul's Boutique</i> (how could they, let alone anyone?), they've created a hedonistic, piston-pumping album that bears as much relation to the urban hustle-and-bustle as it does to festival crowds' surging, ecstatic mindsets, a love letter to NYC that sounds good just about anywhere you're likely to hear it.</p></div>"|19156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19156-duck-sauce-quack/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

There is no horror more visceral than the horror of the impersonal, so it makes sense that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23356-mica-levi/"">Mica Levi</a>, composing the film's score, would turn to the master of elemental horror:György Ligeti, whose ability to gather masses of semitones into translucent wisps without a center made <i>The Shining</i>, which relied heavily on his work <i>Lontano</i>, the scariest movie ever made. (Watch that film with the music off, I still maintain, and it becomes a particularly caustic domestic comedy.)</p>
<p>The score opens with a locust plague of dry tremolos, the strings pressing down until the sound has reached a roar. It's a sound with tremendous menace and weight. From there, the roar shrinks into a whine, and enters a hazy nexus between digitally processed and live sound. It's an indeterminacy Levi worked hard to cultivate: ""We were looking at the natural sound of an instrument to try and find something identifiably human in it, then slowing things down or changing the pitch of it to make it feel uncomfortable,"" she told <i><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/15/mica-levi-under-the-skin-soundtrack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Guardian</a></i>. Insectile, near-vocal sounds erupt across the tense, arid space of ""Lipstick to Void,"" evoking either <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a>'s berserker <i>Shaking the Habitual</i> or the processed strings from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"">Britney Spears</a>' ""Toxic"". It's an appropriate cross-section for the film, which veers between menace and sexuality and brilliantly cross-wires high-brain and low-groin impulses.</p>
<p>That hovering dust-cloud of strings, which Levi referred to as ""like a beehive"" in her and <i>Under the Skin</i> director Jonathan Glazer's recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9366-under-the-skins-jonathan-glazer-and-mica-levi/"">Pitchfork interview</a>, pops up repeatedly throughout the score with minor additions and tweaks representing the journey of Johansson's character: in ""Meat to Maths"", there are clanging bell-like sounds behind it, while in ""Mirror to Vortex"" it's half-submerged in the amplified sound of its own echo. In the context of the film, these additions feel like the messiness of lived experience muddying Johansson's template, the imprint of the lives she begins to grapple with as her time on Earth extends. The hollow knock of a single drum, like a single dragging foot, is another repeating theme, giving the score a reiterative, hesitant quality. Inasmuch as you can be invited into Johansson's character's head in <i>Under the Skin</i>, the music does the heavy lifting. The score has the feel of a thought process, albeit one conducted by a being you have no genetic relation to.</p>
<p>The music unfolds as deliberately and as unconsciously as the dreamlike film itself. Levi drops in an arching, three-pitch motif at various points, one that lingers on its highest pitch the longest, like a hanging doubt. In ""Lonely Void"", this figure is colored in briefly by a furtive patch of tonal harmony, a startling appearance of warmth that scrubs itself out as quickly but leaves a powerful impression. There are other brief hints of tenderness, particularly in the unearthly pairing of ""Bedroom"" and ""Love"", which lifts the score entirely free from anxiety and into something exalted and sorrowful. Here, Levi's work comes closer to Vangelis than to Ligeti, and completes the film's mysterious arc. Levi's commitment to the film's themes is all-consuming, and the score is so tightly woven into the film's DNA that it is difficult to detach and experience as an album.

February's <a href=""http://sweetvalley.bandcamp.com/album/so-serene"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>So Serene</i></a> mixtape, in particular, was an intriguing mash-up of off-kilter psychedlia, dance, and instrumental rap. Veteran Fillmore rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28818-davinci/"">DaVinci</a> clearly hears something in Sweet Valley's music that transcends novelty status, as he's collaborated with them on their latest mixtape, <i>Ghetto Cuisine</i><i>. </i>The new record is a glossy, practiced-sounding project where the rapper sounds refreshed, relaxed, and jolted out of his comfort zone, an interesting deviation in DaVinci's relatively somber discography.</p>
<p>DaVinci has always been a consistent artist, focusing more on low-key reflections of life in a tough neighborhood than belly laughs on wax. The Fillmore-repping “In My City,” a standout on 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17201-the-moena-lisa/"">The MOEna Lisa</a>, </i>is a proud, detail-laden portrait of a man on his home turf, and even his relatively lighthearted collaboration with Huntsville producers Block Beattaz “Nothin’ Finna Stop Me” showcased a gruff undertone. It’s refreshing, then, to hear DaVinci abandon that side of his personality on <i>Ghetto Cuisine</i> cuts like “Hello Stranger,” a starry, chipmunk-soul-powered sex jam where he reveals himself as an understanding, communicative, and hilarious lover while Sweet Valley provide some cringeworthy punchlines in the form of a crude sound effect. On the no-nonsense gangster cut “Paper Blood”, you can hear the rapper chuckling in the midst of the threatening chorus, while “Cheap Thrills” divulges the ethos of the record with a characteristically straightforward approach: “We ain’t come to hurt nobody,” DaVinci croons. “We tryna have a good time.” </p>
<p>As for Sweet Valley, they do plenty by not trying to do too much: the boilerplate, funk and soul-laced, Bay Area-indebted beats they provide are a great vehicle for DaVinci’s lighter side.  Their production style here isn't terribly progressive, but the Williams brothers aren't completely risk-averse, either: “Work Hard” sweetens the pot with a sped-up version of Barbara Lewis’s “Baby I’m Yours” before dropping the sample out for the majority of the song, giving a real kick to an otherwise superb storytelling track. “I Got That Line” with its revolving door of drum kicks and punctuated sound effects complementing sing-song DaVinci verses, features the kind of left-field decisions that makes you wish Sweet Valley were a little more daring throughout the record.</p>
<p>But keeping it (somewhat) conservative is a smart choice on this first full-length collaboration between Sweet Valley and DaVinci. There’s a good chance that dedicated Wavves fans have never heard of DaVinci, who is still very much an underground rapper, so he has room to demonstrate plenty of times on <i>Ghetto Cuisine </i>that he’s someone worth caring about, giving off an all-inclusive pride on ""I Got That Line"" and elsewhere that, genre shift be damned, makes those unfamiliar with the rapper's work feel right at home.</p></div>"|19279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19279-davinci-sweet-valley-ghetto-cuisine/|7.1|Jonah Bromwich

<p>Though ""Millions of Colors"" dips into proggy psychedelics, most of the tracks on <i>Dizzy</i> are folk songs. ""She Don't Mind"" is an acoustic campfire jam for slackers, as Polizze sings ""Sittin' around in the same old town"" while following a rambling groove and bending a few bluesy guitar flourishes. ""The Earth Creature"" clears some of the fuzz off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14916-public-service-announcement/""><i>Public Service Announcement</i></a>'s ""Beautiful Earth Creature"", revealing the song's gorgeous harmonies and mandolin lines. By pitch-shifting his vocals down, muting his acoustic strums, and falling into a stomping trudge when the chorus hits, ""On the Last Day"" slathers some darkness on a beautifully melancholic song about heartache.</p>
<p>The muddy fidelity of these recordings isn't distracting, as Polizze often manages to buoy some of his best guitar solos above the din. Sometimes, whether intentionally or not, the production becomes a crutch. Since ""Digh High"" takes a couple of minutes to kick into gear, the washy production and warped hiccups are all there is to keep listeners interested. More often, though, the fuzzy atmosphere is the perfect companion for these songs. The acoustic ballad ""Sifting Through My Hands"" seems to emanate from a tin can on the opposite end of the room, accentuating Polizze's hoarse, pained vocals, and when the guitar solo hits, it's muffled but nonetheless feels stark and dramatic.</p>
<p>In addition to <i>Dizzy Polizzy</i>, Permanent recently repressed Polizze's self-titled debut as Purling Hiss from 2009. Compared to <i>Dizzy Polizzy</i>, <i>Purling Hiss</i> is a monster of blown-out, shredding, heavy psych music that consistently locks into a satisfying groove. (Fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8290-earthless/"">Earthless</a>, take note.) Everything is smothered by blaring electric guitars, and it's just as well.

<p><i>Purling Hiss</i> paints Polizze as a Philadelphia guitar hero who uses his prowess to craft heavy psych odysseys through murky territory, while <i>Dizzy Polizzy</i> casts him as a folkie outsider with some devastating songs in tow.

Ohio's Vertical Slit covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>’s “I Remember Nothing” in 1980, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"">Steve Albini</a> became obsessed with the fierce tension of the Comsat Angels before founding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6076-big-black/"">Big Black</a>, and SoCal bootstrappers the Abecedarians released their 1985 debut single, the majestic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpvne78dQoU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Smiling Monarchs""</a>, on <a href=""http://www.factoryrecords.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Factory Records</a>. Appreciation for the sub-genre in the U.S. was alive and well in the '80s, and Jeffrey Runnings, the sole and constant member of Lincoln, Neb.'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1535-for-against/"">For Against</a>, was one of its strongest champions.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To say that For Against has a cult following is an understatement, so it’s a pleasure that Captured Tracks has reissued the band's first three albums. It’s not the full sweep of their career by any means, but this overview of the original lineup's work—Runnings, guitarist Harry Dingman and drummer Gregory Hill—clarifies why the band inspired passion in their listeners. If they had gained a tenth of the attention <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"">Interpol</a> attracted, it would have been a wonderful world.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">1987's<i> Echelons</i> was For Against's debut LP, and its opening track “Shine” captures a blend of sudden-soar sonics and mixed feelings that would become the group’s hallmark. Runnings' vocals occasionally sound tentative, but everything else is in place. Dingman’s guitar underpins Runnings’ verses with focused breaks and melodic lines, and Hill’s drums burst and stomp more forcefully even as he never steamrolls the overall performances. Hill’s elegant drumming, showcased excellently on the title track to 1990's <i>In the Marshes</i> 10"", is an essential element in highlighting For Against's strengths, but Runnings and Dingman's tightly wound partnership served as the band's true core.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The versatile Runnings was able to slash with a deep cut, set a calmly propulsive mood, or just crackle with energy, with vocal abilities that resembled a lost choirboy; Dingman, meanwhile, leaned hard on his digital delay pedals, incorporating the psychedelic, shimmering flow of his contemporaries.<i> In the Marshes</i> consists of demos recorded a year after For Against's 1985 debut single “Autocrat”, sequenced beautifully from the nervous pulse and skitter of opening track “Tibet”, offset by Runnings’s soft wordless chanting and beautifully queasy guitar; elsewhere, the slow burn build of “Amnesia” rivals South London post-punkers the Sound’s fierce <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3kQPJZPBN8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Missiles”</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">1988's <i>December</i> is the strongest collection to come from this iteration of For Against. Vocally, Runnings is mixed up front along with his other band members, resulting in a sound that's bold and brash without being overbearing. Heard in the context of their underground (and major-label) rock contemporaries, <i>December</i> sounds singular: clean, clear, and ruminative rather than chest-beating. Songs like “They Said” and “Clandestine High Holy” are anthems for people who hate anthems, while the title track excels in executing tightly wound, serenely beautiful tension.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After <i>December</i>, For Against's original lineup fractured: Dingman and Hill went on to form the Millions while Runnings continued with a new lineup of For Against throughout the last two decades, sounding out of sync than ever with whatever trends came along.  Dingman rejoined the band last decade, and albums like 2008's <i>Shade Side Sunny Side</i> and the following year's <i>Never Been</i> proved that the band could still produce some truly beautiful, fierce results—but regardless, they’ve never quite gained the audience they've so richly deserved over the years. They deserve recognition for their early-adapter approach to post-punk, as well as for sticking with it until and after everyone finally came around. Most importantly, though, these albums just <i>sound</i> great, as this box set represents a band hearing something from somewhere else and doing something specific and unique with it.</p></div>"|18980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18980-for-against-box-set/|7.8|Ned Raggett

And just what did Slint think their audience—who, judging from the faint smattering of applause, barely cracked the double digits—needed to hear at that moment? A freakin’ Neil Young cover, and a wholly reverential, note-for-note eight-minute reading of “Cortez the Killer”, at that. But the moment is significant nonetheless, and not just because “Cortez” proved to be the root DNA of the ominously methodical music they would go onto explore; that brief spoken introduction counts as an extremely rare document of Slint actually asserting their worth in public.</p>
<p>In many respects, the story of Slint is an exceedingly familiar one of influence accruing in absentia, of mavericks who were ignored in their time and had to wait years to get their due. Except unlike other members of the criminally neglected alt-rock trailblazer club—from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">the Stooges</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>—Slint didn’t just fail at becoming the world-beating superstars that their record labels and music-critic boosters alike hoped they would be. Through their initial 1986-1991 existence, Slint were obscure outsiders even within the subterranean confines of the American indie-rock underground. </p>
<p>Compared to the get-in-the-van, play-anywhere ethic practised by fellow 1980s-hardcore students, Slint rarely performed live, and when they did, it was rarely as a headliner. Interviews were scarce; band photos all the more so. <i>Spiderland</i>—their second, final, and ultimately most revered album—wasn’t some painstaking, <i>Loveless</i>-scaled masterwork belabored over in the studio for months on end; it was a collection of six pared-down basement jams recorded over a single weekend, with many of the lyrics rush-written at the last minute. And Slint were so uncertain of their purpose upon the album’s completion, they actually included a call-out for female-vocalist auditions on record’s back cover, before just deciding to disband altogether prior to its official release. With <i>Spiderland</i>’s chilling, dead-of-night ambience, its predatory rhythmic gait, spine-tingling guitar plucks, and short-story narratives recited in unnervingly hushed tones, Slint had essentially crafted the mysterious soundtrack to their own disappearance. Even that seemingly innocuous, <a href=""http://cdn.pitchfork.com/features/9319/4baa5214.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Will Oldham-shot album cover</a> of the band members playfully swimming in a quarry looks just like the sort of photo you see on an 11 o’clock news bulletin about four local teens who went missing on a camping trip.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until their friends—in bands as stylistically divergent but spiritually connected as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">the Jesus Lizard</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5814-palace-brothers/"">Palace Brothers</a>—achieved some degree of national renown in the mid-90s that Slint began its transformation from footnote to boldface; to read interviews with these and other affiliated groups in magazines such as <i>RayGun</i>, <i>Alternative Press</i>, and <i>Option</i> was to play a game of Spot the <i>Spiderland</i> Namedrop. By 1995, Slint started turning up <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_(film)#Soundtrack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on major-label-issued movie soundtracks</a>; by ’96, Gavin Rossdale was dialing up Steve Albini—who recorded <i>Tweez</i>—to bring some of that corrosive crunch to Bush’s <i>Razorblade Suitcase</i>. And with the similarly atmospheric, equally explosive likes of Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor dominating the late-90s indie-rock conversation, Slint ceased to be just some band that had broken up too soon and became an entire subgenre of music unto itself.</p>
<p>But well after they ascended to sainthood status, Slint’s sense of timing remained as curiously off-kilter as the tempos of their signature songs. In 2005 the band reunited, a good five years after the post-rock they’re credited with spawning had peaked in popularity. And now, after a few years of intermittent touring, we have the 23rd-anniversary box-set reissue of <i>Spiderland</i>, featuring a much-needed remaster courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3763-shellac/"">Shellac</a>’s Bob Weston, 14 previously unreleased outtakes, a handsome 104-page photographic history of the band (with a foreword from Oldham), and director Lance Bangs’ thorough and intimate feature-length documentary, <i>Breadcrumb Trail</i>. On the surface, it’s the sort of hefty package that adheres to the standard process of classic-rock-level canonization. But true to the band’s spirit, the set is ultimately a grandiose act of self-effacement. Because for all the mystique Slint have acquired over the past two decades, no one has been more mystified by the band’s rising posthumous reputation than Slint themselves. (I mean, just look at the cover of the box set—notice something missing?) </p>
<p>Rather than trumpet the album’s immense influence on subsequent generations of indie rockers, emo kids, and doom-metalheads alike, everything about this set works the other way to disassemble a quote-unquote classic<b> </b>into its basic raw materials. The demos practically break down <i>Spiderland</i> on a riff-by-riff basis, as we hear the songs devolve from pre-production dress rehearsals to rudimentary acoustic sketches recorded on cassette. The visual materials, meanwhile, trace <i>Spiderland</i>’s genesis back through the unheralded but highly fertile 80s Louisville post-hardcore community (which served as a sister scene to the Touch &amp; Go/Drag City stables in Chicago), all the way to the formative relationship struck by band principals Britt Walford and Brian McMahan when they were kids attending a downtown alternative elementary school.</p>
<p>Early in Bangs’ film, Walford claims he was bored with rock‘n’roll by the time he was 11; by the time they were teenagers, he and McMahan were already bored with hardcore, having served time in horror-punk torchbearers (and certified Friends of Danzig) Maurice and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a>-styled thrashers Squirrel Bait. When the duo formed Slint with Maurice guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6018-david-pajo/"">David Pajo </a>and bassist Ethan Buckler, there was little to suggest the band would amount to anything more than another of Walford and McMahan’s impulsive extracurricular projects, which at that point had included everything from videotaped improv comedy routines to cassettes featuring nothing but the sound of their flatulence, samples of which reportedly seeped into the mix of <i>Tweez</i>. Though obviously indebted to the caustic, caterwauling post-punk of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0xCAZLE7c8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their producer’s former band</a>, <i>Tweez</i> also gleefully subverted underground orthodoxies: In contrast to hardcore’s stern, anti-authority-figure rhetoric, the band named each of the album’s songs after their parents, while Pajo’s avant-Halen squeals and Buckler’s muscular but dextrous basslines meant <i>Tweez</i> wound up not too many slam pits removed from late-80s funk-metal phenoms like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1441-faith-no-more/"">Faith No More</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2166-janes-addiction/"">Jane’s Addiction</a>. (Dissatisfied with Albini’s recordings, Buckler left the band shortly after <i>Tweez</i>’s release, and was replaced by Todd Brashear.)</p>
<p>When Slint began working on the songs that would form <i>Spiderland</i> in 1989, the initial wave of post-hardcore indie rock was on the wane, with scene stalwarts either trading up (the major label-bound <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a>) or breaking up (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"">Black Flag</a>, Mission of Burma) or both (Hüsker Dü). Recorded by their friend Brian Paulson, <i>Spiderland</i><i> </i>would forge a new indie-rock lexicon by applying hardcore’s emotional intensity to music that, formalistically speaking, was its complete inverse. Even in its heaviest moments, <i>Spiderland</i> wasn’t so much about rocking as stalking: Songs prowled instead of pummeled, with clean, glistening guitar lines (inspired by Pajo’s obsession with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">Minutemen</a>’s D. Boon) accentuating lyrics that were muttered rather than screamed, all enhanced by a strategic use of space that meant the silences between the notes accumulated their own crushing weight. The album’s definitive bookend tracks—“Breadcrumb Trail” and “Good Morning, Captain”—don’t so much shift from quiet to loud as from bleak to blinding, with McMahan and Pajo emitting the sort of frequencies that make you cover your eyes instead of your ears. And when the band do encroach on something resembling conventional rock—like with the meaty, metallic, morse-code riffage of “Nosferatu Man”—it’s to a sadistic, merciless degree of excess, until you feel like the poor bastard in the movie <i>Se7en</i> whose stomach explodes after being force-fed too much spaghetti.</p>
<p><i>Spiderland</i>’s volcanic outbursts naturally count as the album’s most bracing, memorable moments. The one drawback is that they occasionally obscured and overshadowed McMahan’s monologues, which remain eminently unnerving for both their delivery (not so much “spoken word” as melody-averse singing imbued with cold-blooded, dead-eyed dread) and their amazingly immersive economy. Even a simple opening line like “Don stepped outside” (from the distorto-folk centerpiece “Don, Aman”) instantly sets a vivid scene of simmering unease, of needing to escape from some stifling, suffocating situation; the devastatingly melancholic “Washer” scans as a break-up ballad, but could also very well be the prelude to a murder-suicide. (Fortunately, Weston’s new master gives McMahan’s voice a greater clarity, while the amplified-vocal demos of “Good Morning, Captain” and “Nosferatu Man”—not to mention the supplied lyric sheets—allow you to follow the words more closely.) Back on <i>Tweez</i>’s “Carol,” Slint hinted at the darkness lurking in the backwoods of suburbia “past where they paint the houses”; forsaking its predecessor’s inside jokes for outsized drama, <i>Spiderland</i> ventures past that point of no return where the mundane turns horrific, with songs of vampiric lust and county-fair roller-coaster rides and boat trips gone terribly wrong. When Slint do inevitably unleash the noise, it’s less a sonic device than a narrative one, to mark the moment after which, for the songs’ protagonists, nothing will ever be the same again.</p>
<p>And that seemed to be the case for the band itself. The one Slint legend Bangs’ film does confirm is that, after recording the harrowing vocal climax on “Good Morning, Captain,” McMahan checked himself into a hospital. And the fact that nothing more is said of his stay supports the theory that for Slint, <i>Spiderland</i> was something of a transformative, <i>Deliverance</i>-type experience for the band members—<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">what began as a casual amusement among friends unwittingly lead them into somewhere very dark and disturbing, </span>the details of which are never to be discussed publicly.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">(The box set reveals a couple of instrumental bed tracks from heretofore unpublicized, eventually aborted post-</span><i>Spiderland</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> sessions—the fragmented “Todd’s Song” and the drum-machine-ticked “Brian’s Song”.

<p>However, the album’s shadowy aftermath doesn’t necessarily make <i>Spiderland</i> a more intriguing artifact; likewise, the fact its creators were actually a bunch of goofball pranksters from loving, supportive, well-to-do families in no way diminishes the album’s grim majesty and visceral potency. If anything, the elucidating peek behind the curtain that Bangs’ documentary provides makes the album feel like an even more singular, remarkable achievement. <i>Spiderland</i> has always felt like the work of old, wizened souls who had endured great physical and psychological trauma and barely survived to impart their cautionary tales. But even with the visual evidence presented here, it’s still hard to fathom that music this visionary, disciplined, and emotionally resonant was being made by a bunch of guys still in their teens. (Slint may have a great band, but they were even better actors.)  <i>Spiderland</i>’s greatest legacy is not that it motivated a cluster of semi-popular bands in the late-90s and early 2000s to adopt its whisper-to-scream schematic. It’s the boundless inspiration it perpetually provides for all the bands that have yet to emerge from the basement. </p></div>"|19182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19182-slint-spiderland-remastered-box-set/|10.0|Stuart Berman

Bursting onto the scene with rabble-rousing gusto and a reputation for wild live shows, teenage MCs Wiki and Hak (of the Upper West Side and Harlem, respectively) and Harlem-based producer Sporting Life aim to revitalize the reckless spirit of classic New York rap.</p>
<p>From the title of their full-length debut <i>So It Goes</i>—a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vonnegut reference</a> that doubles as commentary on whether hip-hop is dead—to the album's nearly-exclusive focus on New York as a muse, it's impossible to misinterpret Ratking's stance on the constant conversation that runs through hip-hop culture. “This ain't 90s revival/ It's earlier, it's tribal revival,” Wiki raps on “Protein”, a disorienting song with an insistent MIDI tone driving the beat, a lengthy instrumental break in the middle, some understated singing, and a lot of disembodied yelling. Above all, Ratking's palette is restless, chaotic, and cluttered, and accordingly <i>So It Goes </i>sounds like it exists in its own world.</p>
<p>It's an album tied inescapably to its urban setting, with snippets of voices and the dings of closing subway doors drifting around under the clanging instrumentation. Sporting Life's instrumentation crackles with energetic drum-machine patterns and digital washes of noise, but the sound of <i>So It Goes </i>is never <i>too</i> harsh, with soulful backing vocals and meandering horns that offer an underlying warmth, particularly on the languorous highlight “Snow Beach”. The contributions of engineer and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a> associate Young Guru (again, the New York lineage here is solid) are valuable, too: while previous Ratking recordings occasionally sounded claustrophobic because of the chaos' collision with the dense jumble of lyrics, <i>So It Goes </i>sounds spacious and clear.</p>
<p>The increase in clarity includes Wiki and Hak's rapping. Wiki first attracted attention as an MC due to his dense, rapid-fire delivery, and both rappers have a gift for freewheeling, tangled flows. However, their presence is satisfying on a basic level, too, breaking from the anti-expressiveness that often comes with such lyrical recitations. Hak often gives his rhymes a physical depth, creating a percussive effect through heavy alliteration, while the more ebullient Wiki yells and repeats short phrases like the singer of a hardcore band. These phrases echo and ring out like proclamations: “The earth is fucked, the city is gone!”, “The city implodes with the prettiest prose!” “20 degrees outside! We're toasted in the tunnel!” Much of <i>So It Goes</i> isn't as concerned with following traditional rap structures as it is with creating rich panoramas.</p>
<p>There isn't anything here that's trying for pop accessibility (unless you count King Krule's singing on the excellent downer anthem “So Sick Stories”), and <i>So It Goes</i> drags a little toward the end, especially with regards to the title track's new-agey ramblings, so the constant noise and loose structure can feel oppressive. Where Ratking dives deepest, then—the police harassment protest song “Remove Ya” and “Snow Beach”, which addresses NYU's gradual takeover of New York's downtown and paints a rich lyrical portrait—the payoff is greatest, proving that Wiki and Hak are perceptive observers. There's a pulsing, lived-in energy to <i>So It Goes </i>that captures what New York feels like and pushes at the boundaries of lyrically-driven rap. Beyond conversations about their city or genre, Ratking's greatest success is confidently offering a sound that feels untethered from expectations and bristles with the exhilarating energy of trying something new.</p></div>"|19201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19201-ratking-so-it-goes/|7.5|Kyle Kramer

That opening volley of “Oblivious” sounds like a school bus falling into a ravine, or perhaps a piece of rusted machinery designed to cleave and separate this album from its predecessors in Mayfield’s small catalog. For eight years now, the Ohio singer/songwriter has proved one of the more intriguing artists on the fringes of alt-country, with a blurry, slurry vocal delivery and a wry lyrical style that allows for a very frank cataloging of romantic regrets and bad decisions. Yet, she slams her fingers against the strings on “Oblivious” so hard that she effectively unmoors herself from the confines and concerns of country-based songwriting. She is entering new territory that is perhaps a bit more idiosyncratic, a bit more extreme, a bit less well behaved.</p>
<p>This is the only dramatic addition to her sound on her new album, <i>Make My Head Sing.... </i>Otherwise, the record represents a careful subtraction of instruments and elements until only the basics remain: voice and guitar, drums and bass. It's her first without <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11618-dan-auerbach/"">Dan Auerbach</a> at the helm, but ironically it’s the album that best captures the minimalist rock ethos of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"">Black Keys</a>. Co-producing with her bass player and husband Jesse Newport, Mayfield keeps the sound loose and roomy, preserving the effect of three musicians huddled in a cramped practice space. There’s something certainly compelling about this raw, minimalist sound, even if it buffs away the wry twang in her vocals and shifts the focus away from her songwriting.</p>
<p>In fact, the difference between <i>Make My Head Sing...</i> and Mayfield’s previous records may be as simple as the difference between a guitar album and a singer/songwriter album. The focus here is squarely on the guitar, and there’s an intriguing messiness to her playing, a sculptural approach that favors rough surfaces and sharp edges. After the gangly metal crunch of opener “Oblivious” comes the murky “I Wanna Love You”; “Pure Stuff” stumbles and surges like an early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> b-side, while the postpunk riff on “Do I Have the Time” shimmers like the sequins on the album cover. Elsewhere, she summons <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr</a>. <i>Make My Head Sing...</i> can be scattershot and unfocused, but especially after two albums dominated by very distinctive guitarists—Auerbach on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12398-with-blasphemy-so-heartfelt/""><i>With Blasphemy, So Heartfelt</i></a> and her brother David Mayfield on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15090-tell-me/""><i>Tell Me</i></a>—it’s good to hear her emerge as a resourceful and compelling player herself.</p>
<p>This new musical direction of course informs her lyrical approach, twisting her reverbed psychodrama into something like a variation on the blues. Mayfield favors skeletal song structures and delirious repetition, as though she’s trying to say as much as possible with a few words as possible. On “Standing in the Sun,” that approach conjures a sense of queasy, heatsick regret, especially as Mayfield layers her vocals like she’s going out of focus. But concise does not always mean weighty or evocative. For all its insistence, <i>Make My Head Sing</i>... is strangely slight and ephemeral. These aren’t short songs, but even “Pure Stuff” and “Unknown Big Secret”, both of which lurch past the five-minute mark, sound like they’re over before Mayfield has a chance to unspool her ideas adequately.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s a consequence of this new sound: She emphasizes the guitar parts to the neglect of every other element. And yet, Mayfield remains an incisive lyricist with a sharp humor that gets underplayed by her deadpan delivery. “I could kill her with the power in my mind, but I’m a good humanitarian,” she sings on “Oblivious,” dismembering that unwieldy word at the joints as she shoots daggers at the other female corner in a love triangle. On closer “Seein* Starz”, she tells a man, “You’ve got a stranglehold on my heart.” Mayfield has insisted for years that love is treacherous and obliterating, and on <i>Make My Head Sing</i>... her guitar enacts that romantic violence. It provides an intriguing counterpart to her vocals, turning her inner monologues into something like an argument. </p></div>"|19173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19173-jessica-lea-mayfield-make-my-head-sing/|6.9|Stephen M.

It may seem like an exaggeration to say that the majority of contemporary populist dance music emanating from England—from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a> to Deckstar, and from 2-step to deep house, from jackin’ to grime—exists primarily as raw material for the former star of North England’s bassline scene to work with, but when sampling some of <a href=""http://essentialgarage.blogspot.com.au/search/label/DJ%20Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his recent sets</a>, the statement carries more weight.</p>
<p>Apart from stellar mixing, Q’s key skill as a DJ is his ability to present his eclecticism as purism, weaving together the loose ends of a series of disparate sub-genres into a unified sound which both exists <i>beyond </i>him and <i>because of </i>him. His ultimate mission is to locate and lionize the essential quality of UK urban dance music that is expressed through myriad combinations of shifting stylistic signifiers, helping the listener to follow the music’s pathways from set to set. </p>
<p>His debut album, <i>Ineffable</i>, is a collection of Q’s productions that attempts to capture the broader canvasses he typically works with<i>, </i>offering a neat, carefully pruned cross-section of the more familiar vibes the producer has promulgated: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23832-todd-edwards/"">Todd Edwards</a>-esque vocal tapestries over stuttering house beats and turgid basslines, preternaturally sweet R&amp;B divas singing over syncopated 2-step percussion, cavernous half-step rhythms and aggressive synth riffs offering moments of tension. Those sonic collisions define Q’s best production work: as a grime cut, “Lassie” is so-so, but its queasily harmonizing synth patterns prove both alluring and ominous. “Every Time” is a bass-driven UK Garage track that sounds trapped by its own slinkiness, lost in a purgatory of svelte sensuality that never finds release.</p>
<p>Q’s productions function as a microcosm of the broader sonic parameters he plays with, but the typically bright, shiny precision of <i>Ineffable</i>'s tracks<i>, </i>while bewitching in the midst of a DJ set, can sound incongruous in isolation. That said, there’s at least a few anthems here that point to Q’s skill as a pop craftsman: the simultaneously chirpy and glowering “Notice Me” is begging for a full-fledged UK Garage revival, while winsome closer “Be Mine” scales and almost reaches the heights of Sweet Female Attitude’s “Flowers”. It's a sound that trembles with joy and possibility.</p></div>"|19218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19218-dj-q-ineffable/|7.5|Tim Finney

Elverum & Sun']|2014-04-16 00:00:00|2006|2016-06-11 16:38:58.464741|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1fjprc8zlkw.1.6:0.1.0.$19211/=1$19211.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>The first sound on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wyrdvisions"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wyrd Visions</a>' <i>Half-Eaten Guitar</i> feels old and broken beneath the surface. A neglected-sounding acoustic guitar plays an irregular figure in octaves—two bars of three followed by one bar of five, a waltz doubling over repeatedly with a pierced side. It repeats ceaselessly while a boyish voice chants what might be Swedish (the liner notes give no indication). Each time, a different ""off"" note pokes up, offering itself for study like a tongue running obsessively over a molar. You're given no more information, or much of anything else to focus on, while this incantation spreads out for what feels like half an hour, at least three LP sides. When it's over, you might have forgotten what day it is. </p>
<p>Wyrd Visions is slippery with time this way: Peer into it too deeply and you could fall in. That's what happened to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6029-phil-elverum/"">Phil Elverum</a>, who became transfixed by the project's initial limited-print run on the Blue Fog label. Elverum's in-house label, P.W. Elverum &amp; Sun, has taken to re-releasing it, dubbing it a ""long lost artifact"", and while the facts don't line up that neatly with this claim—the album came out in 2006, and has therefore been ""lost"" since roughly the second season of ""Lost""—the sound suggests they're right in a larger sense. Wyrd Visions is one Toronto man, Colin Bergh, making imagined Nordic music that intentionally has an ancient, dredged-up feel, as if Bergh simply transcribed what Druids hummed to themselves to warm up their caves. </p>
<p>Colin Bergh is not a Druid (he runs a karaoke night in Toronto) but his solo music has a mystical chilliness that makes it easy to see what drew Elverum to him. Both celebrate the pagan naturalism at the root of black metal while rejecting the noise: <i>Half-Eaten Guitar</i>'s six-track, forty-minute run-time makes room for an acoustic cover of Mayhem's ""Freezing Moon"". Bergh's voice is similarly frail and quiet, as if he were standing reverently aside his music rather than making it. And both Bergh and Elverum seem to be trying to paint the same picture with their music—the outline of a stone church in the forest, maybe, or the figures moving dimly outside it—using similar tools. </p>
<p>Bergh's music is ineffably stranger than Elverum's, though—incantatory, acoustic, built in strange meters and rhythms. ""Sigill"" looms over the rest of the album like a great archway, leading to the smaller and quieter sensations offered on its other side. ""Ceremony"" hangs on a simple, tolling perfect fifth, the dried-out framework of a power chord. Almost nothing happens inside of it—nothing describable, anyway. Uncanny sensations pour into the cavernous space Bergh leaves for them in his arrangements. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a> and members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"">Grizzly Bear</a> contributed to the recording, but nowhere on the album do you get the warm sense of neighbors popping in. The album feels entirely desolate, a procession of ghosts. </p>
<p>The name for the project comes from Orson Welles' blood-soaked adaptation of <i>Macbeth</i>, but there is no ""toil and trouble"" hokum on <i>Half-Eaten Guitar</i>. Bergh takes his task seriously, and demands that you do, too. So while ""Bog Lord"" might be a potentially ripe, funny song title (and does contain a lyric about ""dancing and be necromancing""), there is nothing to snort about in the song. It begins with Bergh humming an ear-troubling, tritone-filled melody. Oddly jaunty whistling crosses over him. A guitar plays a high, winding staircase of a melody. In the end, Bergh begins chanting --""W-Y-R-D V-I-S-I-O-N-S across the sky."" It becomes clear: For Bergh, this is holy music. </p></div>"|19211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19211-wyrd-visions-half-eaten-guitar/|7.8|Jayson Greene

Rather, <i>Do to the Beast </i>is best right before all hell breaks loose. On “Royal Cream”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10286-bobby-womack/"">Greg Dulli</a> and the band draw out the verse for an extra beat or two, ratcheting up the suspense before surging into the swaggering chorus. You brace yourself for the impact, as you would in a car crash. Occasionally, Dulli veers away from that brick wall at the last second; rather than burst into the expected minor-key chorus, “Lost in the Woods” upshifts into a major key, making the song sound like a pivotal and distinctive plot point in the album’s larger narrative of sinners redeemed, saints brought low, and Dulli just barely surviving.</p>
<p>It's a sensation similar to watching a Hitchcock film, and perhaps Dulli picked up the trick as a film student at the University of Cincinnati in his pre-Afghan days. (When the band signed with Elektra in the early 1990s, the label agreed to fund his feature-length directorial debut, which he sadly never found the time to make.) He deployed the suspense-building technique during his tenure with that band, but didn’t really master it until well into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27519-twilight-singers/"">Twilight Singers</a>’ catalog. That latter outfit never had a set lineup, so it could expand or contract in accordance with Dulli’s creative whims, often giving him a larger orchestral palette to work with. In that regard, it’s tempting to call <i>Beast</i> a Singers record rather than an Afghan joint: It’s carefully and richly arranged, less a rock album than a rock soundtrack.</p>
<p>On <i>Do to the Beast</i>, Dulli seems less interested in rehashing the raw rock-quartet attack the Afghan Whigs mastered in the 90s than he is in building on it. The pummeling math-rock riff of “Matamoros” and the impossible breakneck pace of “The Lottery” recall the band in spirit if not precisely in sound, and opener “Parked Outside” may be the heaviest thing he’s ever committed to tape. These songs are orchestrated grandly to draw out the dark drama of Dulli’s lyrics, which continue to plumb the deteriorating effects of drugs, crime, and love, but overall there’s less groove than you might expect from an Afghan Whigs album.</p>
<p>The shift in aesthetic is owed to the logistics of this reunion. In addition to Dulli, only one of the founding Whigs members, bassist John Curley, shows up. Guitarist Rick McCollum is MIA, and the Afghan Whigs never even had a semi-permanent drummer to reunite with, so there's fewer charter members playing on this album than there were on the two new songs from their 2007 retrospective, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10270-unbreakable-a-retrospective/"">Unbreakable</a>. </i>Dulli and Curley filled out the roster with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/139-joseph-arthur/"">Joseph Arthur</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"">Mark McGuire</a>, and Johnny “Natural” Najera (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a>’s musical director), along with members of the Italian indie-rock group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32058-afterhours/"">Afterhours</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/731-chavez/"">Chavez</a>, and others.</p>
<p>In other words, no one involved this album seems terribly concerned with picking up where the Afghan Whigs left off more than a decade and a half ago, and nor should they be: the last thing we need from the Afghan Whigs is 90s nostalgia. Dulli has always been unapologetic about his influences, which have famously leaned toward classic R&amp;B, soul, and funk. That made him something of an outsider in the 90s alt-rock scene—he was dismissed almost as passionately as he was embraced—but it also means that Afghan Whigs albums were motivated by personal vision rather than scene aesthetics and therefore have aged remarkably well.</p>
<p>If <i>1965</i> drew from mid-to-late-60s soul and <i>Black Love</i> was about early-70s Blaxploitation soundtracks, then<i> Beast</i> might be set just a few years before, when the rhythm and blues industry was housed in a few independent labels on Broadway and acts like Solomon Burke, the Drifters, and the Shirelles sang out-in-the-street pop epics with ambitious arrangements and insoluble heartbreak. Dulli knows his history, so when he opens “Algiers” opens with a drumbeat practically quoted from the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby”, he’s using that girl-group staple as a slight-of-hand trick: Instead of bursting into a towering wall of sound, the song settles into a bleak acoustic strum accentuated with castanets and handclaps. Rather than declaring love or promising commitment, “Algiers” evokes a bereft loneliness, his only company “the heavenly demons waiting outside my window.”</p>
<p>Throughout the album, Dulli seems to be treating the band’s own career in the same way he treats an old R&amp;B record: as raw material for his current obsessions. As he nears 50, he’s able not only to play up the rough grain in his voice as he grasps for high notes on “Lost in the Woods”, but also to take in the breadth of his career to date. If his catalog is a car, he’s stripping it of its parts and refashioning something newer, more streetworthy. So <i>Do to the Beast</i> may not always sound like an Afghan Whigs album, but it operates like one, scavenging the darker corners of pop history to create something personal, vital, and urgent.</p></div>"|19214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19214-the-afghan-whigs-do-to-the-beast/|7.6|Stephen M.

It was October 21, 1990, and the 21-year-old drummer set out to pen a Statement of Intent for her brand new punk rock band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"" target=""_blank"">Bikini Kill</a>, the one that would fuel thirdwave feminism and create watershed moments. She had dreamt of starting a world-ruling all-girl band since her teen years. The writings in her zine, <i><a href=""http://jigsawunderground.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jigsaw</a>, </i>archived <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2013/09/zines.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last year at Harvard</a>, helped steer what we know as the DIY punk-feminist movement, Riot Grrrl. Vail’s diary entry was likewise laced with ideology. She was philosophizing a future feminism by describing her own inquisitive evolution, politicizing punk by charging it with the conditions of her life as a woman. Bikini Kill, she wrote, would fight sexism and homophobia, legitimize girl-rock, reclaim the punk domain. For the time being, they ruled their own tiny universe. “I can already feel the power of it and the band is fast becoming the most important thing in my life,” Vail wrote. “I think we will be like thee most misunderstood band ever.” The truth of her vision would soon be revealed—loudly, with serious tunes, and music that was straight fire.</p>
<p><i>Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah,</i> out in March 1993, was their second record, a split with British riot grrrl spokespeople Huggy Bear. Bikini Kill’s half was tracked a year prior in the basement of D.C. punk house the Embassy, where they practiced, and released for their tour with Huggy Bear, which spawned a short doc titled literally: <i><a href=""http://vimeo.com/11737681"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It Changed My Life</a>. </i><i>Yeah</i> was more crudely recorded than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17434-bikini-kill-ep/"" target=""_blank"">the EP that preceded it</a>, or the Joan Jett-produced “New Radio” single that followed, but these tightly-wound anthems and reprimands were the essence of early Bikini Kill. More than any formal Bikini Kill release, <i>Yeah </i>bears a proud and defiant aesthetic of lo-fi amateurism learned from Olympia’s <a href=""http://krecs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">K Records</a>. The rage of their irreverent sneers and power chord slashes were explosive, and their presence was tough, pissed.</p>
<p>Bikini Kill followed a lineage of angry women in rock—the physical surge of X-Ray Spex, the gruff roar of Babes in Toyland. But no band actively created a counterculture for marginalized groups quite like them. To write protest songs that are as intellectually sharp as they are searingly cool and dryly witty—this is one of music culture’s enduring challenges, and <i>Yeah</i> remains a model of the form, a record with a cause and also real edge. The riffs were hard, the pace was breakneck, the drumming was anarchic, but <i>Yeah</i> was as hellishly catchy as it was raw. Kathleen Hanna, the trailblazing singer, said that in Bikini Kill she embodied 1,000 voices, and you can hear this on any of these<i> </i>songs. She pivots between radically contorted stylings—from a childish sing-song playground rhyme to a savage, lion’s roar—in order to show how things like masculinity and femininity were performed constructs, how those qualities are inside of us all. Despite these somewhat pointed concerns, <i>Yeah</i> rarely comes off as topical—Bikini Kill’s mantras are primarily inclusive and therefore timeless. Visceral empathy for the oppressed among us never goes out of style.</p>
<p>Hanna had a unique past, an artist and stripper who worked at a domestic violence shelter. Her mission was fueled with empirical evidence, which she clearly desired to share: <i>Yeah</i>’s opening sample finds a bro-moron suggesting that assault happens “because most of the girls ask for it.” The album is all fight songs, but “White Boy” takes no prisoners; it is pure opposition art, with Hanna appropriating a Rollins-like stalwart stance for <i>her</i> war. “I’m so sorry if I’m alienating some of you!” she screams, a mocking taunt. “Your whole fucking culture alienates me!” It is sad that this central line, a Bikini Kill thesis, feels pertinent in 2014—a world where hashtags must explain that rape culture exists (#RapeCultureIsWhen) and we struggle to eradicate the vicious prevalence of haphazard rape jokes. Hanna’s gritty missives used an uncomfortable erotics to illustrate imbalances of power ingrained everywhere. “It’s hard to talk with your dick in my mouth!” she wails. “I will try to scream in pain a little nicer next time!” The sarcasm is ruthless.</p>
<p>Bikini Kill’s early lyrics cut straight to the point, aphoristic truisms that worked as effectively in song as in the zine manifestos where they also appeared. The vocal escapades of “Don’t Need You” reject outward validation, and its anti-production aesthetic insures it. “This Is Not a Test” succinctly shows how society is flawed, not the girls that suffer because of it: a brutally grunted “YOU’RE FUCKED!” followed by an elastic, playful, and performative, “I’m naahhhht!” “Jigsaw Youth”, the fiery centerpiece, brings unity to their generation of grrrls, instilling the idea of a real social movement. But it underscores multiplicity therein—the many kinds of feminism, or the wide-open nature of riot grrrl. “We know there’s not one way/ One light/ One stupid truth!” Hanna shouts, a classic Bikini Kill line. “Don’t fit your definitions! Won’t meet your demands!” The subsequent track, “Resist Psychic Death”, drives the point that resisting definition (and, like, reading) is the punkest thing you can do.</p>
<p>The propulsive throb of “Rebel Girl” is Bikini Kill’s signature anthem and one of the most distinctive moments in American punk. <i>Yeah </i>marked the first release of this iconic song, a  canonical rallying-call of female friendship and girl solidarity. “That girl thinks she’s the queen of the neighborhood!” Hanna shouts, signaling a floodgate of notes all coded with consciousness. “I’ve got news for you/ SHE IS!” This is spiritual music for feminist punks, yes, but also for outsiders of all stripes. The later Joan Jett-produced version broadened “Rebel Girl”s appeal—faster, tighter, slicker—but the sing-song chants and blurry-erotic <i>“Uhhh”</i>s here are animated, unnerving, provocative, showing cracks and nuance. Hanna’s nonconformist dream-grrrl steamrolled over female stereotypes in rock and the world, evoking revolution with every step.</p>
<p>The word “radical” should not be taken lightly here. This band aimed to fundamentally change how people thought about all manner of hierarchy. It also meant Bikini Kill would do things like climb the roof of a house screening “Twin Peaks”, disconnecting the antenna cable in order to sabotage the party. Bikini Kill were horrified by this show, which they felt had a sexist premise—the mystery of a beautiful dead girl. “We had a vendetta against ‘Twin Peaks’,” guitarist Billy Karren comically writes in the <i>Yeah</i> liner notes, offering context for their early track, “Fuck Twin Peaks”. It’s one of seven newly added early recordings that comprise Side B of this reissue—each purposefully added to illuminate something relevant about the band’s roots. “[‘Twin Peaks’] became the focal point of our initial anger in the band [<i>laughs</i>] which we thought was justified,” bassist Kathi Wilcox told <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2014/04/bikini-kill-premiere-2/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rookie</a>.</p>
<p>The song highlights Bikini Kill’s biting sense of humor, no small feat in the realm of politicized music. As does “George Bush Is a Pig”, in which Karren grunts the title over a Sonic Youth-type freakout. The bloodcurdling shrieks of the Vail-sung “Not Right Now” prove, again, why she put the “grr” in “grrrl”, but its caterwauling rage is also terribly funny: “I’m not the kind of girl who’s gonna sit around and make you treats!” “I Busted in Your Chevy Window” is a powerful piece of spoken-word, performed live with terrifying, blood-boiling intensity, offering a tangible window into these legendary early shows. “Why”, Hanna writes in the notes, was her first go at songwriting, a piercing and raw ballad in the vein of her 1997 solo record <i>Julie Ruin</i>. The best of Side B is “Girl Soldier”, a chilling military march regarding the U.S. government’s ceaseless war on women—they used it to open a 1992 gig outside the Capitol with Fugazi, where they protested the rightward swing of the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>“I believe with my whole heartmindbody that girls constitute a revolutionary soul force that can, and will, change the world for real,” Hanna once wrote. It was only a matter of time. In 2011, before leading a guerrilla art collective that has effectively revealed the bitter truths of modern Russian life, Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova lectured at a conference on the history of feminist art; Bikini Kill was her first slide. In 2014, on the cover of <a href=""http://www.elle.com/news/culture/miley-cyrus-tavi-gevinson-interview-may-issue?ha=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the latest <i>ELLE</i></a>, teen publishing mogul Tavi Gevinson has interviewed pop’s reigning star, Miley Cyrus—discussing such topics as feminism and gender equality. Conversations in music have expanded and Bikini Kill and comrades pried them open. The dominant Y-chromosomes of punk’s DNA would not change on their own—the canon of Black Flag and Ramones, the degenerate gigs of macho-ritual where dudes went to get spat on. Imagine the air sucked from a room. The window has no handle. The door has no knob. The only option is to smash through and breathe. That was Bikini Kill, busting barriers in a way no one had. They staked out new territory in rock and now it belongs to them, and us.</p></div>"|19153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19153-bikini-kill-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah/|8.6|Jenn Pelly

Either somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a> and Tom Krell or a leader of the ignominious ""Australian sound"" depending on who you ask, Faker's standard-bearing might seem a little premature. <i>Built on Glass, </i>as his first full-length, is therefore his case to the world. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There's some premeditation to this statement of his. Faker reportedly scrapped his album twice in pursuit of refining what Chet Faker is supposed to sound like. The result is some inconsistency as Faker tries to reconcile every avenue of his interest with his existing identity, and almost certain disappointment for anyone who expected 52 minutes of Chet as soft-spoken sex facilitator. In the confusion, though, is the chance for surprise, and Faker capitalizes with a hint of just how far his horizons can expand beyond the flaccid cracker-crooning of his previous work.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The first half of the record is where Faker satisfies his obligations. Opening with his trademark Rhodes piano and soupy vocals with ""Release Your Problems"", he then runs through the beat- and sample-chopping singles ""Talk Is Cheap"" and ""Melt"" and the woozy R&amp;B of ""Gold"". The first indication that not everything is as it seems comes on ""No Advice (Airport Version)"": splitting up the two singles, it occupies half its duration with electroacoustic burbling before allowing Faker to sing a few short bars over nothing but a low, vibrating hum.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's necessary to talk about <i>Built on Glass </i>in sides as it makes a point of distinguishing between them. The record pivots with the interlude ""/"", a gravelly Southern accent speaking through vinyl pops and cracks: ""That was the other side of the record. Now relax still more and drift a little deeper as you listen."" This second half is where Faker becomes more adventurous, enough to venture beyond the borders set for him by his first record. With the blueprint reaffirmed by the first side, the back load feels like he's consciously leaving behind familiar ground to investigate his other influences further. Faker plays with depth, allowing each element room to move between the back and foreground. Booming drums shatter the cavernous atmosphere of ""Blush"", broken shards of glass tumble over each other, and Faker's pitch-shifted vocals clash from high and low, finally uniting harmoniously in the middle.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The album's climax is in the coupling of the betrayal-house of ""1998"" and the rhythmic textures of ""Cigarettes &amp; Loneliness"". On ""1998"", Faker's mumblemouth drawl works in his favor, sounding too numb in parts to even motivate his lips, but at least finding the strength to croak ""We used to be friends."" A chattering beat leads it into ""Cigarettes &amp; Loneliness"" and Faker's voice strengthens into a Van Morrison-like lilt, dancing over syllables. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Maybe it's no coincidence that between the whirring synths and the beat, like metal wheels clanking over tracks, it sounds like the siren of a level railway crossing; the kind of place desperate folks all too often wander in their final moments. The track itself conjures a similar, overbearing futility. Again, Faker explores the space, disrupting the stability of its plucked central riff with cascading elements both percussive and melodic, sucking it all up into its weeping choruses as Faker pleads helplessly for understanding. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Faker placed a keyboard on the cover of <i>Thinking In Textures, </i>nodding towards his greatest tool. On <i>Built on Glass, </i>it's replaced by a human hand; possibly a nod towards Faker's adoption of what we still anachronistically refer to as ""real instruments."" While the core of <i>Built on Glass </i>is still drum machines and synthesizers, Faker's expansion into the organic and electroacoustic has given him a wider territory to roam. And while the introduction of those elements into his work might leave some wondering what happened to the bedroom producer who took over Australia with a dashed-off Blackstreet cover, Chet Faker's first full-length album proves that the artist is eager to explore new frontiers.</p></div>"|19224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19224-chet-faker-built-on-glass/|7.3|Jake Cleland

A 2007 compilation titled <a href=""http://www.stalk.net/paradigm/pd21.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Oramics</i></a>—named after her studio and the Oramics Machine she created, in which sound could be manipulated by drawing on 35mm film strips—pulled together some of Oram’s post-BBC commercial work, her ventures into musique concrète, and a number of studio experiments. But the exhaustive 2012 compilation of her material, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16262-the-oram-tapes-vol-1/""><i>The Oram Tapes, Vol. 1</i></a>, had the odd effect of making her work harder to read, largely because it showed how Oram had funnelled her work in a near infinite number of directions. It’s a thrillingly heterogeneous listen, full of moments that can make you think, laugh, and occasionally jump out of your skin when great slabs of avant garde noise rupture from the surface.</p>
<p>If <i>The Oram Tapes</i> thrived on a sense of cheery disorder, <i>Sound Houses</i> heads in the opposite direction. This project, commissioned by Oram’s former employers at the BBC, takes elements of her extensive sound library and throws a frame around them with the involvement of Alessio Natalizia and Sam Willis, who make thoughtful electronic pieces as the <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a>-signed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28335-walls/"">Walls</a>. Here, they test how Oram’s forward-thinking sound pallette holds up when knotted together with contemporary equipment. At times, it’s easy to spot Oram’s hand ghosting behind them—”Rendering the Voice I” begins with a sample from her “Fanfare of Graphs” that’s situated at the same place in the track and remains largely unmanipulated. In those moments, where Walls directly skingraft the 1960s onto the 2010s, the timelessness of Oram’s pieces are thrown into stark relief, with her work immediately feeling at one with the present day.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Sound Houses</i> blurs the lines further than “Rendering the Voice I”, with the sounds of Natalizia, Willis, and Oram entering into an uneasy symbiosis. Walls are careful to make sure there’s some conflict involved, often letting the tension simmer just below the surface as it occasionally does in Oram’s own compositions. “Some Shriller, and Some Deeper” bristles with unease as it slothfully lumbers on its path, while “Rendering the Voice II” perfectly works off the earsplitting electronics Oram would often use. Natalizia and Willis have dialed down the playfulness a touch, perhaps to keep it routed in a world they feel more comfortable in, although elements of humor do emerge; the lumbering drone that’s twisted through the center of “A Very Large Metal Box” is just the right side of clumsy, bringing with it an oafish weight and sense of imbalance that’s positively <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Beefheartian</a> in outlook.</p>
<p>Pete Kember, aka <a href=""http://www.sonic-boom.info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Boom</a>, mastered <i>Sound Houses</i>, helping lift it away from the degraded atmosphere of some of <i>The Oram Tapes</i>, which was largely due to the fact that much of the material had languished in dusty boxes for years. His part here forms a loop back to his work with Oram’s fellow Radiophonic Workshop colleague <a href=""http://www.delia-derbyshire.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Delia Derbyshire</a>, who contributed to his <a href=""http://www.sonic-boom.info/ear.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EAR</a> project and was memorably <a href=""http://www.delia-derbyshire.org/interview_surface.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> by him. It feels like Kember and Oram’s contributions were key at this stage in Walls’ career, whose second album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15901-coracle/""><i>Coracle</i></a>, showed plenty of promise without ever feeling like they’d fully inhabited the world they were trying to create. Here, their curatorial skills guide them in relation to the sound sources, helping fill in the blanks when they hit them, causing them to get lost in inspiration instead of scrabbling around for it. It’s also another fascinating twist to Oram’s story, adding a touch more weight to her legend by making this music breathe once again.</p></div>"|19190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19190-wallsoram-sound-houses/|7.0|Nick Neyland

In the two years since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16212-howler-america-give-up/"" target=""_blank""><i>America Give Up</i></a>—their slack-inflected, Strokes-damaged debut LP—the young Gatesmith’s grown even more grizzled-beyond-his-years, and the band’s gone looser, more ramshackle, cleaving most of the taut turn-of-the-millenium NYC from their sound. <i>World of Joy</i>, Howler’s sophomore set, arrives with hardly a fraction of <i>America Give Up</i>’s hype. This time around, without all the focus on Howler’s extramusical hooks, it’s easier to hear a record like <i>World of Joy</i> for what it really is: half-an-hour of antic, raucous rock’n’roll, no more, no less.</p>
<p>Cheap cigs, cheaper gin, mornings in bed and afternoons on the couch: this is Howler country. But while just a few years have passed since Gatesmith’s golden boy phase, the guy’s aged rapidly: much of <i>World of Joy</i> finds him looking askance at, y’know, “society, maaan,” and he’s not so sure he likes what he sees. Ramonesy yearner “Don’t Wanna” finds Gatesmith rattling off a list of things he urges you to opt out of, if you’re so inclined: “you don’t have to listen to the Smiths if you don’t want to,” he moans, unleashing raspberries at his onetime-labelmates minutes after a none-too-subtle reminder that “we’re being sold.” Jittery opener “Al’s Corral” is similarly indifferent, as Gatesmith rattles off a long list of things he doesn’t want to do. And <i>World of Joy</i>’s title track plays like one long shrug; over a dour, intensifying buzz, Gatesmith repeatedly mutters “world of joy” with as much apparent glee as the counter guy at Panera talking your mom through her You-Pick-Two. For most of the album Gatesmith’s slumped-shouldered, “oh, great, this again” outlook permeates like bongsmoke in a work shirt. But his sour streak isn’t quite caustic enough to overrun these songs with pure cynicism, and there’s enough tenderness in the balladry here to suggest some genuine sincerity behind the smokescreen of sarcasm.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>World of Joy</i>’s exuberant slop is a far cry from Gatesmith’s lyrical listlessness. A Cheap Trick riff here, a Raspberries hook there, a warbly Westerbergian weeper or two: Howler know from power-pop, and while their influences aren’t hard to pick out, their nervy playing and easy way with hook craft mostly gets them past mere imitation. “Here’s the Itch That Creeps Through My Skull” is a Dion song misted in <i>Ocean Rain</i>; closer “Aphorismic Wasteland Blues” is, for all intents and purposes, a skiffle song. Even on the slower numbers, <i>World of Joy</i> manages to maintain a certain wildness. But, for a bunch of guys who do a bang-up job projecting “over it,” Howler certainly seem to take some care in their craft; the rickety playing’s not without its charms, but these songs lose their shape when they start to streak past too quickly. These guys, power-poppers that they are, certainly know their way around a hook. But whenever they let the power overtake the pop, they load said hooks into a canon and light the fuse, leaving you with little else but a trail of smoke.</p>
<p>The trouble with <i>World of Joy</i> isn’t that it’s bad, but that it seems perfectly content to stop short at “pretty good.” These hooks are plenty catchy, but not world-conqueringly so; these performances are lively, but they’re not exactly primed to set the world on fire. And Gatesmith, even with the uptick in aggravation, still isn’t the easiest guy to get a read on: one minute he’s in a swoon, and the next, he’s grousing like a part-time punk. Sometimes rollicking, sometimes righteous, <i>World of Joy</i> is a spiny, strident rock record. But one can’t help but think pushing any one of these elements even further forward—the lyrical insouciance, the four-beers-deep playing, the clattering hookcraft—might help push them closer to the forefront of a crowded field. Still, even if they never quite achieve the greatness promised in those early notices, the world needs pretty good bands, and Howler fit that bill better than most.</p></div>"|19249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19249-howler-world-of-joy/|5.9|Paul Thompson

Earl sings, “It feels strange/ It feels the same”, and that’s really <i>With Light and With Love</i> summed up, since nothing Woods do here will alienate anyone other than the most hardcore 4-track enthusiasts. “Moving to the Left” still slowly unravels into a coda filled with wah-wah guitars, and it’s preceded by the requisite Woods woodshedder that takes up an inordinate amount of the LP’s space. The title track is over 9 minutes, yet it never feels improvisatory or exploratory or tacked on<i>—</i>the wigged-out soloing isn’t meant to show Woods’ considerable chops, only to serve the masterful return to its forceful chorus.</p>
<p>Still, <i>With Light and With Love</i>never makes much of a fuss about its aims. Earl’s lyrics are inquisitive in nature without giving you much to chew on, taking on the form of homilies about self-discovery and existential doubt. No matter how many times I’ve heard him sing “Are we floating by and by/ Are we moving to the left?”, the question never sounds particularly answerable, let alone urgent. And towards the back half, Woods occasionally revert to a genial folk-rock band that can anonymously blend into ""indie BBQ"" playlists. </p>
<p>But the versatility of Woods becomes more evident throughout the album, as they spread outwards rather than building upward: you get B3-infused soul (“Leaves Like Glass”), breezy psychedelia (“New Light”) and darker shades of <i>American Beauty</i> (“Shining”), giving jamband types, roots fans, folkies, indie kids and DIY fetishists a place to link up. “Breakthrough”, “masterpiece”, “bold leap”<i>—</i>those aren’t words that really seem applicable to <i>With Light and With Love</i>, or Woods for that matter, but they’re allowing themselves to be extremely likable for a larger crowd.</p></div>"|19205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19205-woods-with-light-and-with-love/|7.9|Ian Cohen

Mann, whose “Voices Carry” turns 30 next year, is so wry and reserved that she can crack a joke that you won’t get until a verse or two later. Writing with an acerbic precision, she hides her world-weariness in that shirk of a voice, simultaneously jaded yet still vulnerable.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, Leo is a former hardcore punk with a vocal style whose excitability reinforces, rather than undercuts, his smarts. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4739-hearts-of-oak/""><i>Hearts of Oak</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13992-the-brutalist-bricks/"">The Brutalist Bricks</a>,</i> he laid out sociopolitical platforms with such nonchalant specificity that it took a while to realize the darker implications of songs like “Bottled in Cork” and “Me and Mia”. In addition to their predeliction for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54713-the-both-aimee-mann-and-ted-leo-goof-off-in-milwaukee-video-starring-teds-uncle-ed-leo/"">tongue-in-cheek videos</a>, both he and Mann are fiercely intelligent songwriters, but perhaps the greatest difference between them is that he plays the extrovert and she the introvert. His songs reach out into the world, while hers look more deeply inside herself.</p>
<p>The duo joined forces as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32020-the-both/"">the Both</a>, and you’d expect that they’d each bring the other out of their respective comfort zones on their debut album. On a few songs, when the tempos surge, they do: On “Milwaukee”, they devise a witty hook and bolster it with handclaps, a growling guitar outro, and lyrics that offer a from-the-stage perspective on their lives as performers. Similarly, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26449-the-new-pornographers/"">New Pornographic</a> “Volunteers of America” conjures the 1970s pop energy that informed Mann’s last album, 2012's <i>Charmer. </i>Unfortunately, much of <i>the Both </i>is a rocky, frustrating collection of plodding tempos, lackluster hooks, and a pervasive air of mild-mannered gravity. Their insistent emphasis on craft can strangle their songs, as these too-tidy structures and restrained performances undercut the messy emotions of “Pay For It” and the dour “You Can’t Help Me Now”.</p>
<p><i>The Both</i> mostly serves to highlight the duo’s limitations. Mann's voice has never possessed much expressive range, but she's managed to turn that into a strength. She sounds relatively raw and unrehearsed on “Honesty Is No Excuse”, one of her best moments on the album—but the song descends into a cop-out chorus of yeah-yeah-yeahs, a predictable guitar solo, and some of the mopiest handclaps put to tape. It’s a weird mess. Leo, on the other hand, tends to pen melodies that fit his vocal delivery, often favoring breathless surges of syllables that underscore the urgency of his lyrics. When Mann expertly navigates the snaky folk melody of “Hummingbird”, he can only phrase it awkwardly and sound out of place in that setting.</p>
<p>Despite the lows outnumbering the highs, there remains some promise in this pairing, if only because it can potentially uproot both Mann and Leo from their respective sounds. There are just enough intriguing moments on this debut to point out a viable future for The Both, one where they make music that sounds nothing like their solo material yet still bears the DNA of each parent. At heart, this is an enthusiastic debut that can’t quite live up to its own billing, but at least it shows two veterans who have bravely embraced the neophyte’s challenge of figuring out their sound. </p></div>"|19235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19235-the-both-the-both/|5.4|Stephen M.

The project’s creative core, Henry Barnes, first became known as a member of legendary noise-crust band Man is the Bastard, and his turn toward Amps’ form of cracked, rustic art-folk—one that dug Jesus, no less—added an undertone of novelty compared to his MITB’s heaviness. Not that his new album, <i>Canyons Cars and Crows</i>, can be dismissed as an ex-punk’s cranky religious rambling, any more than his prior work comfortably can. As Barnes’ spirituality has receded to a dull, mellow glow, so has his music ripened, deepened, and opened.</p>
<p>Accordingly, <i>Canyons </i>is a burst fruit of an album. The elements of Amps past—feathery jangle, queasily harmonized leads, modulated organ, stomp-box daisy-chains—splay out in all directions, both sweeter and messier. But seeing as how <i>Canyons</i> is Barnes’ first full-length since 2006’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9040-every-eleven-seconds/"">Every Eleven Seconds</a></i>, there’s a deliberateness and refinement to the project’s otherwise chronic lack of sharp focus. The stubborn fuzziness of Barnes’ vision makes for a halo effect: On the instrumental “Hills of Padua”, keyboards are treated and smeared until they bleat like bagpipes, even as Barnes feeds them through a distortion pedal that might have been built out of a Geiger counter. That tattered, mutated, yet undeniably traditional folk air assumes a more solid shape on “Scottish Country Dance”, another vocal-free track that balances chiming delicacy with an earth-scraping underbelly glacial enough to have carved out the Great Glen. Even the Celtic lilt of “Chieftains I” and “Chieftains II” coheres into something more otherworldly than Old World. Still, these instrumentals brush the skin of the album’s dimensionality rather than dive into it.</p>
<p>When Barnes finds his voice, so does <i>Canyons</i>. “Sailor’s Searching” is a celestial shanty worthy of Tim Buckley—if Buckley had been a barnacled merman troubadour. Barnes’ crust roots abound on “Earth is Spinning”, where he sings with gentle, wizardly authority as guitars repurposed as flutes swirl around him. A throbbing oscillation of menacing noise pounds away in the background, like the volume knob of an old stereo is being cranked violently back and forth while a hardcore record plays. Psychedelia mingles with punk and folk, most effectively with “All Messed Up,” which draws on Pearls Before Swine’s caustic, acid-casualty confusion as it were a birthright.</p>
<p>Amps For Christ has long been a family affair, with Barnes’ brother and father often contributing to the recordings. But with “Miss You Mother”, his filial affection grows mournful. A lonesome sitar curls around Barnes’ barebones, Fahey-esque acoustic guitar, while a waveform is whittled into a haunting drone, a looped memory of those since gone. Barnes records at home, and that homespun ethic is more than just a method of expedience; it fills the corners of <i>Canyons</i> with cobwebs and echoes, a cocooning insularity that reduces even the most cosmic sentiment to something small and warm. “Time will come when the oceans rise/ And the coldest place seems so nice/ And through it all, love is still king,” Barnes sings on “Barely Breathe”, his voice shaking in the leafy shade of <i>White Light</i>-era Gene Clark. The President is called out on the carpet with a punk-instilled sneer before being whisked away into folky allegory. Political yet timid, the song almost swallows itself. Cloaked in mystique, sequestered in hermetic glory, <i>Canyons Cars and Crows</i> carries around its own atmosphere—one that Barnes alone can breathe.</p></div>"|19154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19154-amps-for-christ-canyons-cars-and-crows/|7.1|Jason Heller

The band's received several comparisons to their hometown hardcore forebears—Dicks, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2152-stick-men-with-ray-guns/"">Stick Men With Ray Guns</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6194-scratch-acid/"">Scratch Acid</a>, and so on. The sonic similarities are definitely there, and viewing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSet2zls-ao"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">grainy footage</a> of frontman Corey Anderson's sweaty, shirtless, flailing performance style at Austin's Beerland venue confirms that this is intense shit.</p>
<p>Despite the callbacks to the past, the Ghouls do more than ride the coattails of SST and Touch and Go's back catalogs. Situated in the contemporary Austin rock landscape, their sound falls somewhere between the immediacy of <a href=""http://theobniiis.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OBN IIIs</a> and <a href=""http://fleshlights.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Flesh Lights</a> and the oddball headiness of <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/s-srecords/sets/spray-paint-rodeo-songs-lp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spray Paint</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19117-beth-israel-dental-denial/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Beth Israel</a>. Many releases in this sphere focus on fuzz, volume, and speed to compensate for subpar songwriting, but Ghetto Ghouls' skills are a cut above, so don't get too distracted by their slovenly presentation or the<a href=""http://12xurecs.tumblr.com/post/77574766953/ghetto-ghouls-taco-talk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> press photo</a> where Anderson's vomiting. They grab you out the gate with Dan LeVine's blistering guitars and Ian Rundell's pummeling drum onslaught, punishing eardrums with the introductory feedback of ""My Hands"" as those screeches eventually give way to another breakneck drive. Over and over again, they dish out the same indomitable belligerence they've mastered in a live setting.</p>
<p>Anderson's vocals are largely mush-mouthed and muffled, but when the words make it through, they're typically intense sentiments. ""I feel brainwashed,"" he declares in a hoarse singsong on ""SGO"", later admitting on ""Pigs"" that he was  ""Shot in the head"" before declaring that he's dead now. When he screams ""Give me a gun,"" he sounds insistent, screaming with terrifying abandon. (The violent lyrical content makes thematic sense when considering that Ghetto Ghouls took their name from the blood-soaked 1980 vigilante revenge film <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080707/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Exterminator</i></a>.) In the midst of the band's indefatigable wallop, Anderson's voice is the perfect tool to help establish a song's tone. ""Living Alone"" opens gradually and quietly, but as the guitar and drums take their time, Anderson is <i>screaming</i> about his solitude, taking the song from ""paced"" to ""desperate"". LeVine's guitar also contributes in dictating the emotional hue of these songs; his noodling on ""Atomic Bomb"" adds a twitchy, frantic touch.</p>
<p>The best example of what Ghetto Ghouls are capable of is ""Simple C"", which at four minutes is twice the length of every other song on the album. The band's <a href=""http://ghettoblastermagazine.com/2014/from-the-horses-mouth-corey-anderson-ghetto-ghouls-on-ghetto-ghouls/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">initial plan</a> was to make it another loud and fast rager, but in slowing the track down, they find a mid-tempo stride befitting a song that's <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/ghetto-ghouls-simple-c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about</a> hiding depression beneath a facade of happiness. The central bass line isn't especially complex, but it's sturdy enough to support the entire song—and when the guitars come in, they add power to that backbone without showboating. The resulting effect recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28433-eddy-current-suppression-ring/"">Eddy Current Suppression Ring</a>, another band that can rip with the best of them while also just as easily settling into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14017-rush-to-relax/"">relaxed</a> groove. Not every song on <i>Ghetto Ghouls</i> is a home run—the guitar scrape of ""Roofshit"" is grating when it overstays its welcome—but for the most part, Ghetto Ghouls have made an unstoppable, often chaotic vortex of exhilarating punk songs.</p></div>"|19187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19187-ghetto-ghouls-ghetto-ghouls/|7.4|Evan Minsker

The country's most prominent bands, such as Sadistik Exekution, Bestial Warlust (the former band of Destroyer 666 leader K.K. Warslut), and Portal, are united by an absolute abandon of conventional form and an emphasis on conjuring as much chaos as their equipment can physically accommodate. The guitars can sound so reckless that they make Kerry King's free soloing sound like the most conservative nylon-string plucker, the drumming perfectly balances skill and savagery, and the vocalists less resemble singers than they do drill sergeants in spikes. It's metal taken to its absolute limits, nearly bordering on experimental music; Impetuous Ritual, whose guitarists Ignis Fatuus and Omenous Fugue are also in Portal, carry on Australia's reputation for madness with their second album, <i>Unholy Congregation of Hypocritical Ambivalence</i>, which blurs the ever-thinning lines between death metal and noise.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The quartet is sometimes confused as a Portal side project due to the shared members, who in reality only recently joined the long-running Portal; it's also tempting to assume that Impetuous Ritual represent a middle ground between Portal and Grave Upheaval, the latter of which Ignis Fatuus also plays drums in. Portal's sound is more jagged, though, and unless you literally recorded your album in a cave, it is impossible to sound more subterranean than Grave Upheaval. For Impetuous Ritual, repetition is more strongly emphasized than those bands, with tremolo-picking that builds and reinforces a howling wall of despair.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">There are elements that break up the blackened torrent—the bells on “Metastasis,” some disjointed guitar solos here and there, the occasional doom-stomp—but otherwise the mood on<i> Congregation</i> is relentless and impossible to escape. In Portal, Omenous Fugue plays bass and Ignis Fatuus plays drums, so the fact that these guys can play a similar form of death metal in different roles makes you admire their skill in a way that triggers a fear for their well-being. Same goes for<span style=""font-style: normal;""> Ingnis Fatuus' vocals; mostly, he goes for a indecipherable growl, but on “Inservitude of Asynchronous Duality” he reaches piercing highs reminiscent of Absu's Proscriptor. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It's difficult to experience <i>Congregation</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> as anything but a full meditative experience. The vibe</span><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is so oppressive that it's not unreasonable to think that this record really does not give a fuck about any of your feelings. Is it oppression through freedom, or freedom through oppression? </span><i>Congregation</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> concludes with the nearly 15-minute “Blight,” and it's the most warlike in an album littered with doves' corpses. The song represents everything essential about Impetous Ritual pushed further and further into the breaking points of comprehension and endurance. If you made it through “Blight,” then congratulations. Your taste in death metal is superb, and you're probably a little imbalanced. </span></p></div>"|19191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19191-impetuous-ritual-unholy-congregation-of-hypocritical-ambivalence/|7.9|Andy O'Connor

Right now, he's collaborating with A-Trak on an EP, <i>Federal Reserve</i>, which places him lovingly back in the chirpy '03 soul-rap that defined his peak. ""To me, the intersection between my world and Cam’s world is very much tied to that New York, downtown, street wear kind of movement,"" A-Trak <a href=""http://www.complex.com/covers/atrak-and-camron-interview-two-the-hard-way-2014-cover-story/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Complex</a>. ""It’s kids that are happy to hear his music and also jump around to electronic music and hear some Atlanta stuff and some new rap.""</p>
<p>This sounds an awful lot like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4832-girl-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Talk</a> show, where the above scenario would take place in three minutes. In many ways, Girl Talk's music is the gushing id of dilettante culture, a glutinous ball of disparate pop songs mashed together so you only taste the sugar. Now, Gregg Gillis has found himself working with Freeway and the partnership has the same bittersweet tang to it. Since departing officially from Roc-A-Fella after 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10928-free-at-last/"" target=""_blank""><i>Free at Last</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5547-freeway/"" target=""_blank"">Freeway</a> has been in search of a cultural foothold; his attempted rebrand as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13930-the-stimulus-package/"" target=""_blank"">Rhymesayers artist</a> was too slippery to stick, and then he drifted momentarily to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17299-diamond-in-the-ruff/"" target=""_blank"">Babygrande</a>. Throughout, he's never lost his fire, but without a larger context or a new story to tell, he was stuck in an uncomfortable limbo.</p>
<p>Collaborating with Girl Talk doesn't exactly free him from said limbo. But it does give him something more temporary and invigorating—a shot in the arm, a needed jolt of energy that his last two releases have lacked entirely. Girl Talk's production is legit: he has the sound and feel of those early Roc-A-Fella releases internalized, and he spits it out convincingly. ""Tolerated"" gets things off to a rickety start; the big faux-Just Blaze beat Girl Talk provides is too top-heavy and cluttered to move effectively and Waka Flocka Flame raps at about 12-percent energy. The chorus is awkward and strained, all elbows. </p>
<p>But from there, things take off. ""I Can Hear Sweat"" has a strafing arpeggiated synth and a heavy-breathing Biggie sample from ""Who Shot Ya"" that is so tailor-made for a Jadakiss guest verse that you almost hallucinate him rapping on it before he appears. He is murderously intense on it, as is Free. ""Suicide"" fits a lot of little events into the beat without getting too distracting—eerie childlike vocal effects, spaghetti-western whistles, KRS-One vocal snippets. The taffy-pulled strings on ""Tell Me Yeah"", a bald-faced appeal to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GvB9ySUJ3A&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oh Boy</a>"" nostalgists, are stretched out just right. There are one or two ""Oh come on, why is THIS happening now?!"" switch-ups in the beats, which feel like Girl Talk elbowing his way to the fore. But they are rare, and there is a palpable love in the details in Gillis's production. The highest compliment you could pay his work is that it's easy to forget he's involved at all while it's playing. What Gillis has given Free is his best solo project in at least four years.</p></div>"|19250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19250-girl-talk-freeway-broken-ankles-ep/|7.4|Jayson Greene

The brothers' previous album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13917-measure/"" target=""_blank"">Measure</a>,</i> was similarly insular only double the length. Peter expanded on that concept with his solo project, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10182-the-week-that-was/"">The Week That Was</a>, with nine musicians dotting his songs with sundry accoutrement. Meanwhile David’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11034-sea-from-shore/"">first solo album</a> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5583-school-of-language/"">School of Language</a> worked in headier spaces, deconstructing digital textures and power pop into impossible-to-perform tracks that exist more as a thought experiment than something he could pull off live. Well, David has finally lets his guard down with <i>Old Fears,</i> an album that recalls the words of the great guru George Clinton: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbkcWo5I_A8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“funk not only moves, it removes, dig?”</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, you won’t mistake a Field Music solo project for a lost P-Funk album. But when the first sounds of the record nod to both Herbie Hancock’s “Chameleon” and Duran Duran’s “Notorious"", you get a sense of where Brewis is coming from. On the surface, these songs have all the trappings of oblique art-pop, but the music is at its core an homage to the crisp edges of late 1970s funk and early 80s R&amp;B—Dirty Projectors meets <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Mind"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Mind</a></i>. It’s a sly pivot that feels as clever as only someone from Field Music can be. But <i>Old Fears </i>brings you closer to Brewis by clearing away the clutter around him, leaving him singing about young anxiety and young love against mannered proto-funk.</p>
<p>The album’s loose concept draws from Brewis’ collegiate days. With so many touchpoints from the 80s, <i>Old Fears</i> plays like a nostalgic fever dream of someone who just had a breakthrough at therapy. The clipped swing of “A Smile Cracks” could inspire some starchy dancing, but the song is mainly about the affectations Brewis used to adopt as an up-and-coming intellectual. The wordless hook on “Dress Up”—just a carefree synth/guitar unison melody—is the very picture of a block party in the golden-hour of the afternoon, but all the while Brewis sings of his unwillingness to be social. Every song hums and vibrates along on a few different wavelengths.</p>
<p>Brewis’ history as a detail-oriented composer makes <i>Old Fears</i> such a simple album that it could, by most definitions, be considered a collection of demos. But it’s overlaid with a fine layer of psychedelic atmosphere, something filmic and out-of-time, which makes these songs waver in the mind like the memories he recalls. As the 35-minute album bounds on, tight pop-funk fades into more ambient worlds. The final ballad, the serene “You Kept Yourself”, closes with Brewis doing his best R&amp;B impression over an Eno soundscape marked by blurry 4 a.m. guitars and one of those sax solos ripped from popular songs by Quarterflash or Gerry Rafferty. It is the sound of slouching home from the college pub, one of those ones where Brewis spent his time falling in love, and it feels like the one memory he wants to hold on to in the present.</p>
<p>Part of Brewis’ duty in Field Music was to keep them from veering over the edge into too busy AOR prog, and he uses that same keen ear to keep <i>Old Fears</i> from becoming too cute or kitsch with the tweed-funk. Instead of multi-tracked baroque chamber pop, he puts the same attention into only the four or five instruments. There’s hardly ever more than a spacey synth bass, some gated drums, a guitar riff, and Brewis’ buttoned-up falsetto; rare does a pop album have this much depth, especially one that used so few tools to dig it. </p></div>"|19209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19209-school-of-language-old-fears/|7.4|Jeremy D.

Barcelona duo Fabrizio Rizzin and Pere Solé's first LP, <i>Statement of Purpose</i>, was released nearly a decade ago, and it sounded like mildly pleasant table scraps from the waning days of IDM's glitchy heyday; 2008's <i>The Saltire Wave</i> ditched the ones and zeroes for shoegazey textures and patient post-rock instrumentals. They were decent records without much staying power, so it wasn't surprising when Rizzin and Solé took the top of this current decade to follow <i>The Saltire Wave</i>'s drifting tendencies with a series of more rhythmically focused EPs turning to dance music's nocturnal charms.</p>
<p>Rizzin and Solé's early attempts at straightforward club music resembled artists at a creative crossroads, as elements from their past—twitchy glitch motifs, pastoral melodic lines—yelped and wiggled under the pair's skipping, low-slung beats and foggy atmosphere. Their work since <i>The Saltire Wave</i> has felt more like creative workshopping and less about presentation of fully-formed ideas; on their third album, <i>Silent Ascent</i>, a point of comfort is reached. The record is Downliners Sekt's most sonically uniform statement to date, a steady-handed execution of a specific sound—that is, garage-leaning rhythms coated in aromatic vocal samples and drizzled in rain—that suggests a newfound confidence after a decade of trying to find their way.</p>
<p>It's beyond cliché in 2014 to suggest that a given dance record has taken cues from Burial's <i>Untrue</i>—as I <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18820-burial-rival-dealer-ep/"">recently bemoaned</a>, the sound has been in the air since that record's release. But it's impossible to talk about <i>Silent Ascent</i> without mentioning that landmark record's sound. Rizzin and Solé work in the same muted grays and purples that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>'s built his name on, mostly steering clear of plagiarism by liberally applying dub textures while embracing the ruddy emerald-green textures of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"" target=""_blank"">John Talabot</a>'s work. The primary difference between <i>Silent Ascent</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/"" target=""_blank""><i>Untrue</i></a> is that Downliners Sekt are more concerned with atmosphere, with tracks that double the length of Burial's comparatively concise works; regardless, the blink-and-you'll-miss-it similarities between a buried vocal sample in the first third of ""Eiger Dreams"" and the central figure of Burial's ""Ghost Hardware"" are proof that working in such a universally familiar style yields the danger of coming off as mere copyists.</p>
<p><i>Silent Ascent</i> is often a spotless execution of one specific style—the title track's warm organs and ricocheting vocal samples represent the peak of their compositional powers—so the record's most engaging moments come when Downliners Sekt stretch their legs. ""Balt Shakt I"", taken from a 12"" for Infiné from last year, switches things up with sultry vocals, a bed of rolling static, and aqueous synth blurps that sound ripped from ambient techno veteran Thomas Fehlmann's catalog. ""Junior High"" represents the record's ecstatic peak, as a pulsing house rhythm and an ecstatic vocal sample call back to Talabot's psychedelic club creations.</p>
<p>Downliners Sekt excel when it comes to detail, and <i>Silent Ascent</i>'s most surprising moments are the little things—a stray synth arpeggio here and there, the music-hall piano on album closer ""Give Him Your Heart"". Beyond that, this 64-minute album too often sounds samey, as its melancholic fog sometimes threatens to suffocate where it should merely hang above the landscape. It's good that Rizzin and Solé have finally found a sound that, if not especially original, at least feels like a good fit; the challenge they face in the future is expanding on that style without getting too distracted. For now, <i>Silent Ascent</i> shows great promise from a project that was once a minor concern.</p></div>"|19210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19210-downliners-sekt-silent-ascent/|6.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

In fact, Dan Scheuerman’s likely considered the possibility of being better off if Deleted Scenes straight-up failed: the core of <i>Lithium Burn</i> consists of songs that tacitly acknowledge the brief, teasing glimmers of hope, of getting close enough to a breakthrough just to realize how far away they are. During “Let’s Not Fix Everything At Once”, Scheuerman confesses, “I’m not giving up quite yet/ I’m out trying to make it pay”, and bringing in Brian McTear and Jonathan Low (</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national""><span>The National</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/""><span>Sharon Van Etten</span></a><span>) to produce puts a bold underline on his next lyric<i>—</i>“One last shot to make my way.” </span></div>
<p>On the one hand, this ain’t <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9219-the-wrens/"">The Meadowlands</a><i>—</i></i>its quotidian struggles can't be expanded into a morality play on the music industry. Whereas the Wrens made it clear that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE7IMHRjbeQ&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Everyone Choose Sides”</a> when faced with the question of whether to call it quits in the face of humiliation and missed opportunities, there are no easy ultimatums to be found here<i>,</i> no shady record execs, no broken marriages, no callback to past songs. If you had no awareness of Deleted Scenes’ track record to date, it’s easy to hear <i>Lithium Burn</i> for what it is<i>—</i>an honest account of what happens when years of small, short-term decisions put you in a place where you really don’t want to be and it’s unclear how you’re going to get out of it. Most of Scheuerman’s lyrics can just as easily apply to someone who’s starting to wonder if they’ll ever be more than this damn accounting job.</p>
<p>That much is driven home by “Let’s Not Fix Everything At Once”; the title recalls a line from the National’s “Fake Empire”, which now is a distant memory from a time when that band could be considered an overlooked group of struggling, white-collar types rather than bards of that realm. But whereas Matt Berninger offered comfort and the sense that, eventually, everything <i>would</i> get fixed, Scheuerman takes a deflated tone over quietly thumping drums, stuck in a restless night doing inventory of his mounting problems<i>—</i>“I’m not paying off my loans/ I’m not saving up for a home/ I’m not doing what you’d hoped I would with the life I chose.” There’s only the slightest spark left in him, asking his partner to stick around for at least another year, as this relationship is the only thing that “makes him real"", ""real"" ostensibly meaning ""adult.""</p>
<p>But maintaining that part of his life proves to be just as difficult; the surprising major-key piano modulations allow Scheuerman to keep a stiff upper lip during “Seasons of the Wire”, where a spiritual rut is blamed on a litany of mundane circumstances<i>—</i>the G train, migraines, porn sites, and yes, marathon viewing sessions of ""The Wire"".  What’s sadder is that at no point during <i>Lithium Burn</i> do Deleted Scenes sound like they’ve thought of an exit strategy<i>—</i>the closing track “You Get To Say What You Want” offers sarcastic applause to people who challenge the status quo; they're seen as smug, not sympathetic.</p>
<p>In its stronger moments, <i>Lithium Burn</i> could pass for a follow-up to Dismemberment Plan’s ruminative, then-swan song <i>Change</i> that would engender less ill will than last year's <i>Uncanney Valley</i>. Deleted Scenes make effective use of breezy guitars, plainspoken vocals, and a lightly caffeinated rhythm section that acknowledges the shifty D.C. punk that came before it. Similar to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vczKuqg7ZGI&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Come Home”</a>, there’s also a song where Scheuerman tries to hash things out with his parents (“Tell Me a Secret”). And if it lacks for hooks, dour ballads like “Landfall” and “Caught in the Brights” linger like Scheuerman’s pervasive worries, McTear and Low’s spacious production capturing pianos and reverbed guitar leads bouncing through a sparsely filled club.</p>
<p>But while that makes <i>Lithium Burn</i> an honest album, many of those same qualities don’t necessarily make it compelling. There isn’t a lot of fight in <i>Lithium Burn</i> and it’s understandable, considering its emotional state<i>—</i>but it eventually feels trapped inside its own self-fulfilling prophecy. When Deleted Scenes aspire for more attention, their music suffers: the frenzied, wordless shrieks of opener “Haircuts/Uniforms” sets a properly anxious tone that gets sublimated throughout and when they revisit it on hyperactive lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16170-stutter/"">“Stutter”</a>, the combination skronking guitars and gnarled vocal effects just sound like the most grating D-Plan song on every one of their records being played at once. While <i>Lithium Burn</i> is an easy album to empathize with, you wish it'd do more to make you root for the band; <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">the more important difference between this and </span><i>The Meadowlands</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is how Deleted Scenes can’t manage enough moments where their station of being overlooked becomes an injustice to the listener rather than an understandable reflection of a solid, unfashionable indie rock band that just never really caught a break.</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><br/></span></p></div>"|18858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18858-deleted-scenes-lithium-burn/|6.5|Ian Cohen

The album was fueled by the anger within Triptykon's guitarist, vocalist, and primary songwriter Thomas Gabriel Fischer—better known as Tom G. Warrior—over the tumultuous breakup of Celtic Frost, the pioneering metal group he was long associated with. Celtic Frost laid the foundation for death and black metal, pushing metal into more obscure territories with riffing inspired by both classical music and Discharge; the group's Gothic sensibilities in songwriting and dress still loom over underground metal. Fischer became the “Dethroned Emperor” he once sang about from Celtic Frost's internal strife, and he wasn't going to take that lying down.</span><i> Melana Chasmata </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">is the follow up to </span><i>Daimones</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, and while it retains much of the strength of its predecessor, it doesn't quite feel like the triumph Triptykon's debut did.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">This is not to say the album lacks passion—far from it, in fact. To grasp the intensity of </span><i>Chasmata</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, Fischer's uneven musical history needs to be considered. Despite their enormous influence, Celtic Frost were never a stable group, and their attempt at glam metal, </span><i>Cold Lake</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, remains a despised record amongst metal diehards. (In retrospect, had it been released under a different moniker, </span><i>Lake</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> would be considered a fine glam record.) Fischer quit music altogether following the first dissolution of Celtic Frost and <a href=""http://primitive-future.blogspot.com/2011/02/tom-warrior-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">moved to the States for a brief time</a>; in the mid-'90s, he formed Apollyon Sun, a group whose limp industrial metal sounded like it was trying too hard to sound current. Fischer placed himself in a tough position to bounce back from, but somehow, he did it: around the turn of the century, he rebooted Celtic Frost and invited Martin Ain, the band's longtime on-and-off bassist, back into the fold. 2006's </span><i>Monotheist</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> sounded different from Celtic Frost's previous records, and for a minute it seemed like the reformed Celtic Frost actually had something to say—but that all fell apart.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">So Fischer's rocky history lent a drive to push himself that's evident in Triptykon's music. As with</span><i> Daimones</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, </span><i>Chasmata</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is a series of dense compositions filled with the dark crunch of Fischer's and V. Santura's guitars, set to changing currents from outright malestrom to creeping death fog. “Tree of Suffocating Souls” wastes no time in getting into action, immediately blasting where “Goetia,” the leadoff track from </span><i>Daimones</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, took two minutes to speed up. </span><i>Chasmata</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> features faster songs than its predicessor, but the close-haning gloom is still prevalent, as Triptykon give special focus to Vanja Šlajh's bass, which lingers in “Boleskin House” and “Demon Pact” to the point where you feel tension in your skin. When I interviewed Fischer <a href=""http://www.crustcake.com/2011/02/crustcake-interviews-triptykon.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">three years ago</a> following Triptykon's first American tour, he said that the low end is vital to the band, citing his disappointment with amateur concert recordings: “If you record it with some cheap microphone on a cell phone...you will lose a lot of the heaviness and darkness that is experienced when you stand in the crowd.” Nothing is taken lightly in this group, and they've got the chops to carry the weight of such seriousness. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Fischer's dedication to Triptykon is also evident in </span><i>Chasmata</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s liner notes, which feature his commentary on each of the album's songs, giving a glimpse into Fischer's thought process and outside inspirations. “In The Sleep of Death” is a tribute to Emily Brontë, and Fischer says the following about ""Breathing"": ""Much of what we experienced and created was dominated by a solemn, at times even despondent mood.</span><span style=""font-style: normal;"">"" Offering an in-depth look into the creative process is not something a lot of metal musicians would do, and it's more evidence that even after three decades, Fischer feels he's still got something to prove.</span></p>
<p style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Fischer is one of the few on his level who can write compelling mid-tempo parts, and that carries over into </span><i>Chasmata</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">: “Breathing” is straight Celtic Frost-esque thrash, and around the three minute mark the whole band becomes slave to the primitive lockstep of Fischer's riffing. His avant-garde tendencies also live on in Triptykon, but thankfully, they're more streamlined and fitting with the atmosphere on </span><i>Chasmata</i><i>.</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> “Pact”'s layered noise is not unlike a digital Penderecki string section, while “Sleep” sees Fischer taking on a more theatrically pained tone in his voice.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Ultimately, </span><i>Chasmata</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is slightly inferior to its predecessor due to a sequencing issue near the record's end. T</span><span style=""font-style: normal;"">he sprawling “Black Snow” transitions to “Waiting”, a lovely track but maybe not the best song to close out the record, making </span><i>Chasmata</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> a record that doesn't quite have the ending to tie everything together. Fischer has managed to stay relevant, and he should be commended for that. The moving <i>Chasmata</i> is a mark of longevity, then, but lacks the bombastic “We're back” quality that Triptykon's debut had—fitting, since first impressions are usually the most lasting.<br/></span></p></div>"|19155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19155-triptykon-melana-chasmata/|7.7|Andy O'Connor

Anderson sings noise-drenched songs about grey ships and blue scars and red pants that hide menstrual blood and drugs that make her so sad that she can’t stop taking them, but that brief moment is slightly jarring because you don't necessarily picture the narrator in these visceral and harrowing scenes sitting in front of a computer. But the line is that much more striking because of the contrast; in hidden bedrooms where goth kids cut their arms with butterfly knives, there’s also, of course, a laptop. And even an act as banal as cracking it open and browsing the web might lead you to confront loss and take stock, and that moment could actually make you ill. On an album with many great images, “Coda”’s moment of digitally-invoked despair stood out, and that anomalous line effectively serves as a portal into another world, the one of EMA’s second album, <i>The Future’s Void</i>.</p>
<p>The key track on <i>Past Life Martyred Saints</i>, and the one that gave the album its name, was its first single, “California”. On it, Anderson sang-spoke lines about splitting from her home in South Dakota and leaving behind friends, who we assume are still there, in order to make her mark as an artist out West. However much of the impressionistic “California” was literally true, it certainly <i>felt</i> like autobiography, and it was emblematic of a record packed with details both personal and universal. <i>The Future’s Void</i> is presented as a different kind of record, one that’s about <i>things</i> and <i>issues</i> instead of people. One of those things is the state of our lives as lived online, with thoughts about Big Data, and, yes, the spiritual vacuum of media-saturated culture. There’s more to the record than that, but given the title, the Oculus Rift headset on the cover, and the content of the two lead singles, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16435-ema-satellites/"" target=""_blank"">“Satellites”</a> and “3Jane”, the initial encounter with it happens within this framework.</p>
<p>Digital culture is tricky to write about, because so much of what we’re used to hearing is delivered as a polemic without complexity. On one side you have people talking about disconnect and loneliness and the deterioration of human interaction, basically saying we’ve changed for the worse, and it’s hopeless. On the other, you have the digital utopians—most of whom make their living from the online world, not coincidentally—and they’re telling us that people are <i>more</i> connected because of technology. Writing about what is almost certainly the truth—that contemporary life is a messy, ever-shifting mix of good and bad, and that generalizations about large groups of people are impossible—is hard enough to do in an essay, never mind a four-minute pop song. So you have to hand it to Anderson for addressing such a difficult subject. </p>
<p>Even the songs here that are not about the media per se have it lurking somewhere in the background. There are lines like “when you click on the link” and “makin a living off of takin selfies” and “feel like I blew my soul out across the interwebs and streams,” and it’s hard not to cringe just a little, because they seem so on-the-nose. I sense judgement in these lyrics, and even if the judgement feels <i>accurate</i>, it’s a point of view we're bombarded with every day, one that is hard to say something new about. Anderson has indicated in interviews that she's aware that she was taking a risk writing about technology, knowingly using phrases that could seem clumsy as a way to push against limtations. But for me, when the record falters, it’s often because these moments take me out of it; they come over as too easy.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that they aren't also used in songs that resonate. “3Jane” is the perfect representation how the album’s awkwardly delivered details can take on serious power when considered whole, and it also seems like the successor to the pairing of “Coda” and “Marked” on <i>Past Life Martyred Saints</i>. The first thing to note about “3Jane” is that the arrangement and melody are absolutely gorgeous, the delicate piano and ghosted synths and thumping tom-toms and shimmering cymbals combine into a ballad that moves with tremendously emotional force. And while lyrics like “it’s all just a big advertising campaign” and “it doesn’t seem like it was only yesterday when you wandered out on superhighway” are iffy, the song ultimately comes over as honest and moving. “It left a hole so big inside of me,” recalls the fantasy of trepanation from “Marked”, and the way Anderson sells it, you feel what she’s feeling.</p>
<p>The aching beauty of “3Jane” is found elsewhere on <i>The Future’s Void</i>, on the sing-song organ that half-quotes the melody from “Taps” (Anderson is a genius at making obvious musical references sound strange) in “Dead Celebrity” and on the mid-tempo acoustic lilt of “When She Comes”—the easiest song on the album, catchy and instantly appealing, with lyrics that feel like an evocative puzzle you don’t need to solve. “100 Years”, a song about history and industrialization, is striking most because of the nakedness of Anderson’s vocal, both fragile and strong; after years of being subjected to Auto-Tune and processing and reverb, hearing a flawed human voice this close to the microphone, outlining a melody and cracking subtly here and there, is so real it’s an almost psychedelic experience. “So Blonde”, the album’s most obviously personal song, crackles with memorably imagery (“her pills are shakin in her bag”) and evokes the alt-rock 90s and the era’s interrogation of cultural iconography, with Anderson’s Courtney Love-like scream on the title refrain driving it home. There are moments of brilliance here.</p>
<p>There are also songs that are easy to skip. Anderson in industrial rock mode just doesn’t work for me this time, and some of that might be up to the production. The album was recorded simply, in her basement, often alone, and sometimes, especially during its quieter moments, that works to its advantage. But the noisy “Cthulu”, “Smoulder”, and “Neuromancer” never hit the intensity they’re going for, and these three songs in sequence in the middle of the record drag it down big time. There are no memorable hooks during this run, and the pinched filter applied to Anderson’s voice wants to evoke a Nine Inch Nails-style blown-out intensity, but it never reaches that pitch.</p>
<p>Still, despite the lyrical clunkers and ill-advised production choices, <i>The Future’s Void</i> has the feel of a real statement, of an artist trying for something new even if she doesn’t always get there.

The music he and Mikey Rocks put out as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5772-the-cool-kids/"" target=""_blank"">the Cool Kids</a> relies on nonchalance rather than a burning desire to impress—it's the kind of rap that works because they're committed to it and have clearly done their homework when it comes to the brand of 1980s revivalism they trade in, understanding the power of negative space and artful simplicity. On the best Cool Kids songs, the less effort it appears they're expending, the better the results. There's a fine line between drowsy charm and inducing sleep, and when the Cool Kids have run into trouble, it's because they've chosen to play the long game rather than strike quickly and get out before fatigue hits. 30 minutes of stripped-down minimalism is refreshing; an hour of it can be a chore.</p>
<p>This is something that Chuck Inglish's first solo album, <i>Convertibles</i>, smartly avoids. It clocks in at a lean 13 tracks, with only two stretching longer than four minutes. Unsurprisingly, the few songs that flirt with the five-minute mark lack the kind of propulsion needed to make it to the finish line; when he has to make space for extended hooks—like on ""P.R.I.S.M."", which finds him adopting a flow more melodic than usual—his songs spit fumes and sputter out of control, unable to regain enough forward motion to correct course.</p>
<p>Then there are the tracks that play up the fact that Inglish is joined by Incubus guitarist and sometimes producer Mike Einziger, whose role on the album seems to be to inject color to Inglish's default monochromatic setting. Einziger manages to add some warmth to the concrete-in-the-shade snap that Inglish favors. While Inglish's production has always paired well with sticky July afternoons, now it often sounds just like one. ""Elevators"" packs a Cali-certified hydraulic bounce to its considerable punch, and even the most retro-leaning beats feature more elements that they would have in the past, approaching a retro-futurism that fits in 2014 quite well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the guests that drop by <i>Convertibles</i> sound at home on Inglish's updated production, the album leans a little too hard on them. At this point, there are no secrets left with Inglish as a rapper. He continues to focus on his holy trinity of topics: how he's hanging out with your girl, how strong his wardrobe is, and how much cooler he is than you. He pulls this off with an effortless professionalism, but rarely manages to spit something that will perk your ears. His raps have never sounded more like wallpaper than they do here, and this is only amplified when rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a> pop up and drops more quotables in one verse than Inglish does on the entire album. Of course, you don't listen to Chuck Inglish for the kind of raps that you try to cram into 140 characters, but because his music sounds great while driving around in the summer and shooting the shit with friends. Because of this inherent charm, <i>Convertibles</i> ends up a low-stakes affair without being a low-quality one. And when you think about it, that's a pretty fair description of Inglish as an artist.</p></div>"|18970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18970-chuck-inglish-convertibles/|6.0|Renato Pagnani

Although his music doesn’t have much sonically in common with punk rock—it has no guitars, no vocals, and generally moderate tempos—you can hear its influence clearly throughout his new album <i>Spiritual</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It comes through loudest in its strictly defined palette of vintage synthesizer and drum machine sounds. <i>Spiritual</i> consists largely of monophonic parts played either with punchy, percussive analog synths or first-generation digital gear that produces low-res tones enveloped in hazily pixelated auras, with little in the way of obvious filters or effects. In synthesizer terms, it’s about the closest thing possible to the bare-bones live-wire rawness of a guitar plugged straight into an overdriven amp, and a compelling expression of punk’s fundamental keep-it-simple-stupid immediacy.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lenis is similarly direct when it comes to putting those tones together. His compositions are lean, unfolding mostly around sparse handfuls of notes arranged into uncluttered grooves. The songs on<i> Spiritual</i> build up a little momentum and then mutate subtly, moving the emphasis between looping melodies and insistent rhythms that change shape over their pop-friendly running times, and as a result the listener is kept slightly off balance for most of the album’s duration. This constantly shifting center of gravity keeps us on our toes, and as a result the songs far more absorbing than the typical instrumental synthesizer album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Stylistically, <i>Spiritual</i> is all over the place. Much of it resembles the hard-edged dance music that Lenis’ adopted homeland was a leading exporter of back during the 80s, reviving the vaguely totalitarian drum programming and black-latex funk of Belgian electronic body music group Front 242. (The syncopation-heavy “Watch the Neon” specifically recalls Trent Reznor’s own early-career attempts at emulating them.) Elsewhere the grooves deepen and harden and start to resemble the synth-based action movie scores from around the same time, like the ominous but strangely pop-compatible scores that John Carpenter composed for his own films.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Elsewhere they go deeper and harder still until they turn into something like early house and techno but a jagged aggressive streak—Lenis’ punk background showing through again—that wasn’t actually present in early house and techno. It’s a raw, primitivist version of proto-dance music, sort of like the way that punk innovators in the 70s who were eager to return rock to a pre-psychedelic state of grace overreached and ended up with something nastier and noisier than rock ‘n’ roll had ever really been.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Spiritual</i>’s most straightforward moment, and possibly its finest (not to mention the most likely to end up in DJ sets) is its penultimate track, “Calibre 2000."" It combines a Chicago house beat, a Detroit techno synth sequence, and an electro melody line, all genres that overlapped in their early days but rarely ever reached this kind of balance within one song. It pays thorough tribute to old styles without being overly reverential, and updates them for a contemporary audience without sounding particularly modern. It’s not just timeless, but causes the time since those sounds first came into the world to collapse around it, with Lenis as the singularity in the center.</span></p></div>"|19223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19223-cute-heels-spiritual/|7.2|Miles Raymer

Perhaps because they come from free improv backgrounds, Golden Retriever’s early cassette and CD-R releases leaned toward steady-state, circuitous instrumental pieces rather than the dramatic engagement of their recent work. <i>Seer</i>, their second record for Thrill Jockey and third LP overall, seems particularly laser-guided in its looping and loping melodies. It continues the careful editing that they practiced on 2012’s <i>Occupied With the Unspoken</i>: synth and bass clarinet lines pop in and splatter the void, and tracks are given room to breathe and unfurl, but they’re never lackadaisical or laborious. Sielaff and Carlson may cop the aesthetics of Klaus Schulze, but on <i>Seer</i> they’re content working on a smaller canvas.</p>
<p>The duo’s increased discipline is most readily identifiable on the interlocking and overlapping instrumentation on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16768-golden-retriever-flight-song/"" target=""_blank"">“Flight Song”</a>. Carlson sets up an asteroid field of pinging synth parts that Sielaff casually weaves through and around, embracing the reedy squeals of his instrument instead of obscuring them with a mountain of effects. On “Superposition”, <i>Seer</i>’s lengthy closer, the duo wrangle serious timbral diversity out of their creaky gear, as Sielaff’s processed clarinet peals make conversational counterpoint to Carlson’s crystalline atmospherics. Before Carlson launches into the sweeping arpeggiation that gives the song its dramatic momentum, it’s the most relaxed moment on the record, but even when the duo stretches out—on “Superposition” and “Sharp Stones”— it never feels like they’re padding time or wasting space. When Carlson slows down the tempo and Sielaff’s work becomes more protracted, these spacier segments set up the more propulsive sections. </p>
<p>Golden Retriever has carved a niche that’s not strictly indebted to post-Berlin School ambient or to the more organic work of new age composers but rather snags details from both aesthetics. It’s transportive stuff when it’s done well, and on <i>Seer</i> they’ve distilled each of the five tracks down to its basest parts, making each feel like a succinct and potent journey in its own right. Albums in this vein can seem like an argument for sprawl, but <i>Seer</i> makes a case that a wondrous interstellar trip can still be focused.</p></div>"|19225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19225-golden-retriever-seer/|7.4|Colin Joyce

The Queen City trio’s perpetually sneering brat-punk most likely isn’t a direct response to their city’s recent musical legacy, but you can imagine some Greg Dulli or Matt Berninger type on the receiving end of lead singer Bridget Battle’s taunts on “McMicken”<i>, </i>from the ""trash pop"" band's self-titled debut: “Your old lady can’t get it up no more/ Or are you just a freak and want some more?” Taking its name from a section of <a href=""http://www.wlwt.com/news/local-news/cincinnati/cincinnati-residents-ask-for-help-with-prostitution-issues-in-area/23933698"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cincinnati notorious for prostitution</a>, ""McMicken"" is told from the perspective of a young woman “Surviving in the streets that the men destroyed,” and though everyone involved is compromised, it’s clear who has the power in this situation<i>: </i>“We’re tough little bitches ‘cause we’re self-employed.”</p>
<p>Not every song on <i>Tweens</i> is that overt about its relationship dynamics, but it’s damn close: the majority of the record focuses directly on boys who fuck up because they don’t know any better. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16529-tweens-be-mean"">“Be Mean""</a> scolds the well-mannered type of male that bores the absolute life out of Battle: “I wish I liked nice, nice boys/ There must be something wrong with me.” The subject of “Hardcore Boy”, the most self-explanatory of <i>Tweens</i>’ eleven tracks, is too caught up in doing hardcore boy things<i>—</i>wearing serious T-shirts, seriously standing alone with a deadly serious expression<i>—</i>to realize that Battle just wants to be taken home already.</p>
<p><i>Tweens</i> is ostensibly meant to be listened to and identified with by people outside of the demographic responsible for making it (none of the band are actually tweens, although Battle skews young at 21), and it’s fun for the whole family (except the parents). Battle and her bandmates actually <i>were</i> tweens at the release of the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4787-be-your-own-pet/"">Be Your Own Pet</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9083-be-your-own-pet"">album</a>, which represents the high water mark for the band's aesthetic (they dutifully cite glammier predecessors like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1129-the-donnas/"">the Donnas</a> as well).</p>
<p>But Battle doesn’t have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27885-jemina-pearl/"">Jemina Pearl</a>’s charisma, and Tweens aren't as adept or distinct as BYOP in terms of their P.O.V. “Bored in This City” boasts a surprising modulation in its hook and a depth that cuts against the generality of its lyricism (“Getting drunk, it ain’t a choice anymore/ I’m wasting away in this midwest hope”), but otherwise Tweens rely on attitude and a mutual understanding of the low stakes to carry them through the album's second half<i>. </i>Even if songs like “Hardcore Boy” and “Girlfriend” follow form lyrically, the actual hooks become something of an afterthought.</p>
<p>Then again, attitude’s gotten them this far<i>—</i>they’ve only been around for two years, and even if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders"">the Breeders </a>were often a disinterested and dispiriting live presence during their more recent tour dates, it was still an honor for Tweens to be tagged as their opener during an East Coast run. On the closing “Star Studder”, all of this finally dawns on Battle, who offers a respite from the insistent tropes and reveals the fear underlying their brash behavior: “Can’t stand all these faces looking straight at me/ ‘Cuz if I lose my cool they’ll see vulnerability.” Tweens will almost certainly be better off if and when Battle loses her cool, but until then, the final line of <i>Tweens</i> embodies the strengths and weaknesses of its staunch commitment to derivative sounds: “All I know is what feels good.”</p></div>"|19188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19188-tweens-tweens/|6.3|Ian Cohen

II"" is one of rap's most perfect sounds—but what is it? It might be a horn. But it also might be an exploding steam pipe, or a car alarm, or a laser-jet printer. An even stranger sound follows it: four notes played on either a guitar imitating a piano or a piano imitating a guitar. The line is so disorienting that it inspired a sixteen-year long hunt for its source, which only ended in 2011 when producer Havoc </span><a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/04/mystery-solved-bronco-solves-mobb-deep-sampling-mystery-thats-remained-hidden-since-95.html%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>confessed</span></a><span> that sample snitches had finally pinpointed their target – a three-second piece of a Herbie Hancock instrumental, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nBikBBDeBM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>sped up and then slowed down</span></a><span>. Playing the sample back to back with its source does absolutely nothing to resolve the mystery of ""Shook Ones Pt II.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For the kids who made it—Albert ""Prodigy"" Johnson, from Hempstead, and Kejuan ""Havoc"" Muchita, from Queensbridge—""Shook Ones Pt. II"" was half war cry, half last gasp. It announced <i>The Infamous</i>, Mobb Deep's second album and their first classic, and in the canon of career-revitalizing rap singles—Kool Moe Dee's ""How Ya Like Me Now"", LL Cool J's ""Mama Said Knock You Out"", Dre's ""Still D.R.E.""—""Shook Ones Pt. II"" is maybe the most effective, and certainly the most devastating.  The song was a rebirth, and the album that it foreshadowed would rewrite their legacy entirely.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>The Infamous</i> was not supposed to happen. Johnson and Muchita had already gotten their shot, releasing a corny, forgettable debut called <i>Juvenile Hell</i> in 1993 that sold 20,000 copies before being dwarfed by <i>Illmatic</i>, which had already traveled the world as a demo before its official release in April of '94. At every radio interview, Havoc and P found themselves answering questions about Havoc's Queensbridge neighbor Nas. In his 2011 memoir <i>My Infamous Life</i>, Prodigy recalls ""Halftime"" pumping out of the speakers at what was supposed to be a Mobb Deep in-store in D.C. Shortly afterward, Mobb Deep were dropped from their label.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>They retreated, licking their wounds, to Havoc's mother's house. In New York, things were getting increasingly serious–<i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i>, also released in '93, had already shipped platinum by May of '94. A revolution was brewing in their own city, and the authors of puerile kiddie sex raps like ""</span><a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1gqn1_mobb-deep-hit-it-from-the-back_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Hit it From the Back</span></a><span>"" were in danger of getting left behind forever. It was out of this brew of desperation and determination that <i>The Infamous</i> began to take shape. Their music took on a grimmer, darker tone.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A few key people took notice. One was Schott Free, an A&amp;R at Loud Records and former member of the short-lived rap group </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRPtMBKTOZI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Legion of D.U.M.E</span></a><span>.; another was Matteo ""Matty C"" Capoluongo, who ran The Source's News section and wrote its venerated Unsigned Hype column. Capoluongo and Free occasionally worked together on behalf raw, roughneck rap, the kind of stuff the industry required occasional nudging to embrace. It was Jacobs, for instance, who initially brought Wu-Tang's ""Protect Ya Neck"" into The Source offices. He and Matty C slipped Mobb Deep's new single, the fierce and focused ""</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20bkKOXUZi8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Patty Shop</span></a><span>"", to influential DJs Stretch and Bobbito. Word spread, albeit faintly, that the duo might yet have new life in them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The third important figure behind <i>The Infamous</i> is Q-Tip, whose bemused presence floats over Mobb Deep's early career. When they were still teenagers hungry for a record deal, Havoc and Prodigy accosted Tip outside of the Def Jam offices. He obligingly ushered the duo into the hallowed offices of Lyor Cohen, whereupon they rewarded him by </span><a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/my-infamous-life-excerpts#2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>accidentally shooting a Def Jam employee in the stomach</span></a><span>. He didn't give up on them, however, and on <i>The Infamous</i>, he does enough work to qualify as a temporary third member—co-producing and rapping on two songs (""Give Up The Goods"" and ""Drink Away The Pain"") and working with Havoc to refine and perfect the album's indelible atmosphere.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It is that atmosphere that lingers, untouched and intact, now that Havoc and Prodigy are reissuing the album via a PledgeMusic-funded project. In addition to the original album, they are including a disc of rare and unreleased tracks from the sessions along with a full new album, confusingly, also called <i>The Infamous Mobb Deep</i>. The branding is odd, and the timing for the project feels a little off: For one, they are claiming a 20</span><span>th</span><span>-anniversary celebration for <i>The Infamous</i> a full year ahead of schedule. For another, the duo recently suffered through a highly publicized, and extremely ugly, split while Prodigy was in prison. Maybe the reissue functions as a renewal of the vows between the two, a way to patch up relations while reminding rap fans, and themselves, of the potential power of a flagging, listless brand.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The reissue, if nothing else, is a helpful reminder that this power is still there, for whoever wants it. The reason </span><i>The Infamous</i><span> remains so untouchable today goes beyond its individual qualities —the vividness of Prodigy's imagery, or the richness of the Queensbridge slang they introduced —into more rarefied air. With </span><i>The Infamous</i><span>, Mobb Deep invented a feeling, one that was more important than any individual word, chorus, or rhyme.  All of New York was embracing degraded production at the time, but Havoc pushed beyond the  low-resolution samples of RZA's </span><i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i><span> into near-total abstraction, producing a masterpiece of low, muffled, and malevolent sounds. The stand-up bass sample on ""Trife Life"" sounds like it has cotton balls behind the strings. The implication of vinyl crackle in ""Eye for An Eye"" feels like a needle dragging on tendons.  ""Q.U. -- Hectic,""  boasts a glowing, pulsing piano echo that feels nearly sentient, like some kind of slit-eyed pet monster Havoc is resting one hand on to keep calm.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Throughout, Havoc and Prodigy exude the confidence and comfort of artists who have found their voice and their ideal environment, and can break whatever rules they want. If they want to interrupt their album after one song in so Prodigy can deliver an Henny-soaked rant promising to punch other rappers in the face ""just for living?"" They'll do that (""The Infamous Prelude"").  If Q-Tip wants to drop into ""Drink Away The Pain,"" a tightly themed song about alcoholism, to rap only about his clothes—he'll do that. Nothing disturbs the surface. Every decision feels seamless and inevitable within the bubble Havoc and P.  created.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There is a wholeness, an impenetrable circularity, to</span><i> The Infamous</i><span> as a result. Havoc, who grew up in Queensbridge, taught Prodigy how to rap in the secret-handshake style of his projects, while Prodigy, whose grandparents were jazz royalty, taught Havoc how to use studio equipment. In each case, the student became more adept than the teacher, and the result is a seamless cohesion, Havoc and Prodigy representing two halves of an endlessly repeating thought. Sounds repeat themselves like distant lights, or recurring nightmares, blurring your sense of the album's progression: That unforgettable ""skree"" from ""Shook Ones"" reappears on the chorus of ""Q.U. – Hectic."" With apologies to </span><a href=""http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/03/10/true-detective-post-mortem-creator-nic-pizzoletto-on-happy-endings-season-2-and-the-future-of-cohle-and-hart/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Nic Pizzolatto,</span></a><span> there is a distinct ""This has all happened before, and will happen again"" air of fatalism to </span><i>The Infamous</i><span>. And while gangsta rap had been fatalistic before 1995, it had never <i>sounded</i> quite this fatalistic.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Appropriately, </span><i>The Infamous</i><span> also marked the moment that the language in gangsta rap shifted from corner scrambles and specific vendettas to all-out war, endless and impersonal.  ""Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted/ So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it,"" Prodigy raps on ""Trife Life"". He's not targeting anyone in particular--just ""the enemy."" This was the logical conclusion to the lyrical (and literal) arms race in mid-90s gangsta rap; Mobb Deep got all the way to the end first, and said everything best. The album's most famous and oft-quoted lyrics remain ""There's a war going on outside no man is safe from,"" from ""Survival of the Fittest"", but Havoc's ""Q.U.--Hectic"" line ""Real like an innocent child that turned killer"" tells it just as well: From here on out, this would the only kind of reality Havoc and P would explore, or acknowledge.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That worldview is what's missing on </span><i>The Infamous Mobb Deep</i><span>. Or, if it’s there, it comes through crackly and unreliable, like a radio station just out of range. As a Mobb Deep project, it's mortifyingly weak—before 2006's </span><i>Blood Money</i><span>, the duo had never made a bad album, and </span><i>Blood Money</i><span> was bad precisely because it wasn't a proper Mobb Deep album, but rather a fourth-rate G-Unit record with Havoc and Prodigy rapping listlessly on it. This time, they have no one to blame but themselves. Their lack of investment is audible on every level: The beats feels tinny and wheezy, and the album hardly sounds mastered, full of clippy snares and poorly synced vocals. The beat on ""Get Down"" is barely audible. The hooks are just flat chants with no rhythm or life in them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The chemistry between the two, more troublingly, is nowhere in sight. Prodigy has receded further and further into idiosyncrasy as a solo artist, to the point where it's difficult to imagine him belonging to a group at all. He doesn't even offer any of his choice ""</span><a href=""http://nahright.com/news/2008/02/27/how-dare-you-question-ps-trendsetting/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>HOW I FOLD MY BANDANA</span></a><span>"" weirdness: ""I flood the cold streets with your hot blood"", from ""Taking You Off Here"", is about as hard as he tries, as far as imagery or wordplay or contrast goes. He can still summon vivid, bone-chilling imagery, and was doing so as recently as his </span><span><i>Bumpy Johnson</i> EP</span><span>. But he barely shrugs his way through </span><i>The Infamous Mobb Deep</i><span>. Taken as a whole, the album is exactly the sort of hastily tossed-off, forgettable project that legacy acts will sometimes tack onto can't-miss releases such as this. It's a shame they did.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The disc of rare and unreleased tracks from the 1994 </span><i>The Infamous</i><span> sessions, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that reissues are made for. Many of these songs have been available to hardcore rap fans for years, but the best of them, like “Take It In Blood” and “Gimme The Goods”, are the equal of anything that made </span><i>The Infamous</i><span>.

II"" is one of rap's most perfect sounds—but what is it? It might be a horn. But it also might be an exploding steam pipe, or a car alarm, or a laser-jet printer. An even stranger sound follows it: four notes played on either a guitar imitating a piano or a piano imitating a guitar. The line is so disorienting that it inspired a sixteen-year long hunt for its source, which only ended in 2011 when producer Havoc </span><a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/04/mystery-solved-bronco-solves-mobb-deep-sampling-mystery-thats-remained-hidden-since-95.html%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>confessed</span></a><span> that sample snitches had finally pinpointed their target – a three-second piece of a Herbie Hancock instrumental, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nBikBBDeBM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>sped up and then slowed down</span></a><span>. Playing the sample back to back with its source does absolutely nothing to resolve the mystery of ""Shook Ones Pt II.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For the kids who made it—Albert ""Prodigy"" Johnson, from Hempstead, and Kejuan ""Havoc"" Muchita, from Queensbridge—""Shook Ones Pt. II"" was half war cry, half last gasp. It announced <i>The Infamous</i>, Mobb Deep's second album and their first classic, and in the canon of career-revitalizing rap singles—Kool Moe Dee's ""How Ya Like Me Now"", LL Cool J's ""Mama Said Knock You Out"", Dre's ""Still D.R.E.""—""Shook Ones Pt. II"" is maybe the most effective, and certainly the most devastating.  The song was a rebirth, and the album that it foreshadowed would rewrite their legacy entirely.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>The Infamous</i> was not supposed to happen. Johnson and Muchita had already gotten their shot, releasing a corny, forgettable debut called <i>Juvenile Hell</i> in 1993 that sold 20,000 copies before being dwarfed by <i>Illmatic</i>, which had already traveled the world as a demo before its official release in April of '94. At every radio interview, Havoc and P found themselves answering questions about Havoc's Queensbridge neighbor Nas. In his 2011 memoir <i>My Infamous Life</i>, Prodigy recalls ""Halftime"" pumping out of the speakers at what was supposed to be a Mobb Deep in-store in D.C. Shortly afterward, Mobb Deep were dropped from their label.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>They retreated, licking their wounds, to Havoc's mother's house. In New York, things were getting increasingly serious–<i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i>, also released in '93, had already shipped platinum by May of '94. A revolution was brewing in their own city, and the authors of puerile kiddie sex raps like ""</span><a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1gqn1_mobb-deep-hit-it-from-the-back_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Hit it From the Back</span></a><span>"" were in danger of getting left behind forever. It was out of this brew of desperation and determination that <i>The Infamous</i> began to take shape. Their music took on a grimmer, darker tone.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A few key people took notice. One was Schott Free, an A&amp;R at Loud Records and former member of the short-lived rap group </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRPtMBKTOZI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Legion of D.U.M.E</span></a><span>.; another was Matteo ""Matty C"" Capoluongo, who ran The Source's News section and wrote its venerated Unsigned Hype column. Capoluongo and Free occasionally worked together on behalf raw, roughneck rap, the kind of stuff the industry required occasional nudging to embrace. It was Jacobs, for instance, who initially brought Wu-Tang's ""Protect Ya Neck"" into The Source offices. He and Matty C slipped Mobb Deep's new single, the fierce and focused ""</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20bkKOXUZi8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Patty Shop</span></a><span>"", to influential DJs Stretch and Bobbito. Word spread, albeit faintly, that the duo might yet have new life in them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The third important figure behind <i>The Infamous</i> is Q-Tip, whose bemused presence floats over Mobb Deep's early career. When they were still teenagers hungry for a record deal, Havoc and Prodigy accosted Tip outside of the Def Jam offices. He obligingly ushered the duo into the hallowed offices of Lyor Cohen, whereupon they rewarded him by </span><a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/my-infamous-life-excerpts#2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>accidentally shooting a Def Jam employee in the stomach</span></a><span>. He didn't give up on them, however, and on <i>The Infamous</i>, he does enough work to qualify as a temporary third member—co-producing and rapping on two songs (""Give Up The Goods"" and ""Drink Away The Pain"") and working with Havoc to refine and perfect the album's indelible atmosphere.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It is that atmosphere that lingers, untouched and intact, now that Havoc and Prodigy are reissuing the album via a PledgeMusic-funded project. In addition to the original album, they are including a disc of rare and unreleased tracks from the sessions along with a full new album, confusingly, also called <i>The Infamous Mobb Deep</i>. The branding is odd, and the timing for the project feels a little off: For one, they are claiming a 20</span><span>th</span><span>-anniversary celebration for <i>The Infamous</i> a full year ahead of schedule. For another, the duo recently suffered through a highly publicized, and extremely ugly, split while Prodigy was in prison. Maybe the reissue functions as a renewal of the vows between the two, a way to patch up relations while reminding rap fans, and themselves, of the potential power of a flagging, listless brand.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The reissue, if nothing else, is a helpful reminder that this power is still there, for whoever wants it. The reason </span><i>The Infamous</i><span> remains so untouchable today goes beyond its individual qualities —the vividness of Prodigy's imagery, or the richness of the Queensbridge slang they introduced —into more rarefied air. With </span><i>The Infamous</i><span>, Mobb Deep invented a feeling, one that was more important than any individual word, chorus, or rhyme.  All of New York was embracing degraded production at the time, but Havoc pushed beyond the  low-resolution samples of RZA's </span><i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i><span> into near-total abstraction, producing a masterpiece of low, muffled, and malevolent sounds. The stand-up bass sample on ""Trife Life"" sounds like it has cotton balls behind the strings. The implication of vinyl crackle in ""Eye for An Eye"" feels like a needle dragging on tendons.  ""Q.U. -- Hectic,""  boasts a glowing, pulsing piano echo that feels nearly sentient, like some kind of slit-eyed pet monster Havoc is resting one hand on to keep calm.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Throughout, Havoc and Prodigy exude the confidence and comfort of artists who have found their voice and their ideal environment, and can break whatever rules they want. If they want to interrupt their album after one song in so Prodigy can deliver an Henny-soaked rant promising to punch other rappers in the face ""just for living?"" They'll do that (""The Infamous Prelude"").  If Q-Tip wants to drop into ""Drink Away The Pain,"" a tightly themed song about alcoholism, to rap only about his clothes—he'll do that. Nothing disturbs the surface. Every decision feels seamless and inevitable within the bubble Havoc and P.  created.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There is a wholeness, an impenetrable circularity, to</span><i> The Infamous</i><span> as a result. Havoc, who grew up in Queensbridge, taught Prodigy how to rap in the secret-handshake style of his projects, while Prodigy, whose grandparents were jazz royalty, taught Havoc how to use studio equipment. In each case, the student became more adept than the teacher, and the result is a seamless cohesion, Havoc and Prodigy representing two halves of an endlessly repeating thought. Sounds repeat themselves like distant lights, or recurring nightmares, blurring your sense of the album's progression: That unforgettable ""skree"" from ""Shook Ones"" reappears on the chorus of ""Q.U. – Hectic."" With apologies to </span><a href=""http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/03/10/true-detective-post-mortem-creator-nic-pizzoletto-on-happy-endings-season-2-and-the-future-of-cohle-and-hart/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Nic Pizzolatto,</span></a><span> there is a distinct ""This has all happened before, and will happen again"" air of fatalism to </span><i>The Infamous</i><span>. And while gangsta rap had been fatalistic before 1995, it had never <i>sounded</i> quite this fatalistic.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Appropriately, </span><i>The Infamous</i><span> also marked the moment that the language in gangsta rap shifted from corner scrambles and specific vendettas to all-out war, endless and impersonal.  ""Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted/ So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it,"" Prodigy raps on ""Trife Life"". He's not targeting anyone in particular--just ""the enemy."" This was the logical conclusion to the lyrical (and literal) arms race in mid-90s gangsta rap; Mobb Deep got all the way to the end first, and said everything best. The album's most famous and oft-quoted lyrics remain ""There's a war going on outside no man is safe from,"" from ""Survival of the Fittest"", but Havoc's ""Q.U.--Hectic"" line ""Real like an innocent child that turned killer"" tells it just as well: From here on out, this would the only kind of reality Havoc and P would explore, or acknowledge.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That worldview is what's missing on </span><i>The Infamous Mobb Deep</i><span>. Or, if it’s there, it comes through crackly and unreliable, like a radio station just out of range. As a Mobb Deep project, it's mortifyingly weak—before 2006's </span><i>Blood Money</i><span>, the duo had never made a bad album, and </span><i>Blood Money</i><span> was bad precisely because it wasn't a proper Mobb Deep album, but rather a fourth-rate G-Unit record with Havoc and Prodigy rapping listlessly on it. This time, they have no one to blame but themselves. Their lack of investment is audible on every level: The beats feels tinny and wheezy, and the album hardly sounds mastered, full of clippy snares and poorly synced vocals. The beat on ""Get Down"" is barely audible. The hooks are just flat chants with no rhythm or life in them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The chemistry between the two, more troublingly, is nowhere in sight. Prodigy has receded further and further into idiosyncrasy as a solo artist, to the point where it's difficult to imagine him belonging to a group at all. He doesn't even offer any of his choice ""</span><a href=""http://nahright.com/news/2008/02/27/how-dare-you-question-ps-trendsetting/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>HOW I FOLD MY BANDANA</span></a><span>"" weirdness: ""I flood the cold streets with your hot blood"", from ""Taking You Off Here"", is about as hard as he tries, as far as imagery or wordplay or contrast goes. He can still summon vivid, bone-chilling imagery, and was doing so as recently as his </span><span><i>Bumpy Johnson</i> EP</span><span>. But he barely shrugs his way through </span><i>The Infamous Mobb Deep</i><span>. Taken as a whole, the album is exactly the sort of hastily tossed-off, forgettable project that legacy acts will sometimes tack onto can't-miss releases such as this. It's a shame they did.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The disc of rare and unreleased tracks from the 1994 </span><i>The Infamous</i><span> sessions, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that reissues are made for. Many of these songs have been available to hardcore rap fans for years, but the best of them, like “Take It In Blood” and “Gimme The Goods”, are the equal of anything that made </span><i>The Infamous</i><span>. They extend the album’s long shadow and give a fuller picture of Mobb’s startling leap in confidence from </span><i>Juvenile Hell</i><span> to </span><i>Infamous</i><span>. There are a couple fan Easter Eggs here too, the most notable of which is the “</span><a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/04/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-mobb-deeps-the-infamous/eye-for-an-eye-remix-with-ghostface-killah"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>lost reel</span></a><span>” early version of their Raekwon/Nas collaboration ""Eye For An Eye"" with an alternate Nas verse and a vintage Ghost verse.

His best tracks are vibrant in their nutty, wild-eyed ways, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7447-go-plastic/""><i>Go Plastic</i></a>'s ultra-precise “My Red Hot Car”, or when they sound like a refined version of his rubbery, bass-driven puzzles (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12376-just-a-souvenir/""><i>Just a Souvenir</i></a>'s “The Coathanger”). Sometimes, his work seems designed to provoke fatigue, with the sheer density of sound violently throwing up multiple barriers to entry, to the point where his listeners are left skirting on an infinite loop somewhere outside the process. Pitchfork’s Jess Harvell described Squarepusher’s last full-length album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16608-ufabulum/""><i>Ufabulum</i></a>, as having an “angry-jazz-droids-run-amok” feel—a useful summation of his sound that now reads as oddly prescient: on <i>Music for Robots,</i> Jenkinson hands the keys to the car to some actual droids.</p>
<p>This five-track EP was conceived after Jenkinson and a number of Japanese composers received an invite to develop music for a group of music-playing robots collectively named Z-Machines. The robots are programmed to play somewhere beyond the human realm—there's a guitarist with 78 fingers, and a drummer with 22 arms. Naturally, the corporate world quickly zoomed in on this phenomenon, as Coors’ alcopop offshoot Zima sponsored a rather dispiriting-looking debut show by Z-Robots in 2013. “When [the robots] see the audience raise up their bottles of Zima, they jam harder,” reads a caption in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK9n97fN1Go"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a> YouTube clip.</p>
<p>Watching a dreadlocked robot shredding in proportion to how enthusiastic an audience is about promoting a drinks company—with its eyes lit up in a message from its sponsor, no less—may put a damper on any “New robot overlords” thoughts. But enlisting Jenkinson to see just how far out they can push the concept means that at least someone in the Z-Robots team has been dreaming creatively. Regardless, for anyone with a cursory knowledge of the Squarepusher back catalog, the results on <i>Music for Robots</i> are unsurprising. This is no brave new world Jenkinson is entering; instead, it sounds like he schooled a group of robots in his familiar musical motifs, dragging them down with him into the mix of jazz fusion and electronics he’s been peddling for the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Although Jenkinson seems like an adventurous choice to test out this type of composition, in a sense he’s not the right guy for the job. His bass playing—so fluid, so knotty, but so often a triumph of technique over feeling—already has an un-human remove to it. So when EP highlight “Sad Robot Goes Funny” enters into the realm of blur-of-fingers playing, it doesn’t feel like there’s much going on that we haven’t heard in prior Squarepusher records, especially as it’s tied to berserk drum patterns that carry a whiff of jazz. Anyone wondering whether genuine machine music can provoke an emotional response won’t find any answers here because it’s all wrapped up in the work of someone who has spent much of his career retreating from feeling. There’s no combat to this music—as strange as it sounds, this feels like a collaboration between like-minded peers.</p>
<p>That Jenkinson's involved in work of this type shouldn’t be a surprise, and to criticize it for being something it was never trying to be is an easy stumbling block to encounter when discussing Squarepusher. But there's still questions about the validity of <i>Music for Robots</i> beyond its status as a musical exercise. Most of it dips into detached terrain; the manic piano runs of “World Three” are rendered without drums, and the layered buildup on “Dissolver” is executed in such a precise manner that it’s positively suffocating in its rigidity. It leaves Z-Robots feeling somewhat pointless beyond the novelty status afforded to a group of machines performing on stage. But this is an album released on Warp with a notable contributor on board, which triggers wider questions about what it brings to the conversation—that is, a daring vision of the future that turns into a humdrum training session at the office.</p></div>"|19242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19242-squarepusher-z-machines-music-for-robots/|5.7|Nick Neyland

His tenure as the shamanic, enigmatic frontman of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2559-lungfish/"">Lungfish</a>—<a href=""http://www.dischord.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dischord</a>'s  most arcane band, and one that appears to be as unofficially defunct as close contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a>—saw the bearded, glowering, knuckle-tattooed enigma evolve from a growling poet into a mantra-chanting ritualist before finally falling off the face of reality and into the realm of outsider solo albums (some made exclusively with <a href=""http://www.dischord.com/release/nolib2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">improvised Jew’s harp</a>).</p>
<p>Lately, Higgs has returned to more rocking territory as a frequent guest vocalist for the Swedish group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27751-the-skull-defekts/"">the Skull Defekts</a>, and <i>Dances in the Dreams of the Known Unknown </i>is Higgs’ third album with the band. On previous releases such as 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15139-peer-amid/""><i>Peer Amid</i></a>, the collaboration has yielded hypnotic wonders and grueling drone-gluts alike. <i>Dances </i>has a lighter, more porous touch, as aggression and angularity still dominate the group’s noise-born compositions, but they’ve been honeycombed with pockets of atmospheres and cells of relative silence.</p>
<p>The most striking example is album cut “Awaking Dream”, a hollow, ghostly echo of a Higgs-plus-Defekts song as the band shivers in a sequence of controlled, krautrock spasms, Higgs hovering over synths and drums like a crucified prophet. “Expanding, oh oh oh, contracting/ Spiral arms curving out and streaming in,” he sings, not-so-subtly conflating orgasms with the horror of cosmic realization. If Wilhelm Reich had worshipped Cthulhu, he might have written like Higgs.</p>
<p>Compared to his vocals in Lungfish, though, Higgs’ contribution is hushed and muted. The roar is gone, and it’s missed, since Higgs barely registers on <i>Dreams </i>at all. He's not featured on the much of the album, and that will be a drawback for almost anyone who engages with the album while hoping to engage with Higgs. Granted, the Skull Defekts make fine music on their own, but they sound more alluring and entrancing when their wagon is hitched to Higgs. “Patterns of Thought” and “The Known Unknown”, two of <i>Dreams</i>’ best tracks, fuse abrasive circularity with numbing oblivion, but “Venom” and “King of Misinformation” come across as pseudo-industrial self-parodies. Higgs has been cited as a the band’s “spiritual ringleader”, and his status as the Skull Defekts’ official fifth member has been officially cemented. But <i>Dreams </i>could have used a lot more of his voice, verse, and devilry.</p></div>"|19203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19203-the-skull-defekts-dancing-in-dreams-of-the-known-unknown/|6.8|Jason Heller

Give Christopher Taylor this, he probably made a few good mixes back in the day.</p>
<p>But good taste is a crucial quality for music supervisors and owners of clothing boutiques, not necessarily songwriters. Which is just as well, since<i> Tremors</i> seems desperately wanting for the approval of the former two groups. As producer, Taylor only grasps the superficial aspects that made his influences timely, as opposed to what made them timeless<i>—</i>melody, rhythm, atmosphere, texture, just to name a few. As such, <i>Tremors</i> is nu-nu-indie R&amp;B, cluttered, painfully stylized, and overaccessorized with baubles.</p>
<p>Rather than trusting a groove, triplet beats are bent out of shape for no reason and bump like a broken bicycle wheel. Chopped up and humidified vocal harmonies lend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14308-the-wheel/"">“The Wheel”</a> an intriguing introduction, but what was once a subversion of R&amp;B tropes has become a trope itself, lending an unintentional irony to the title’s usage in chorus (as in “reniventing…”). As those samples just stammer on throughout its entirety, the drum programming is the sound of James Blake endlessly rummaging through a bag of Tinkertoys. Even when “Artifice” becomes the first time that <i>Tremors</i> wisely settles into a steady rhythm, the soggy hook feels pulled from the depths of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29483-when-saints-go-machine"">Infinity Pool</a></i>, the last record from the similar, unfashionably late When Saints Go Machine.</p>
<p>Presumably, the songs with a less obtrusive production touch would fare better and they do in the sense that SOHN is trying to make music for commercials rather than “commercial music."" As a vocalist, Taylor’s no showstopper, but he is capable, able to nimbly swoop from a blanched moan to falsetto when the situation calls for it. But for an album where every song is documenting some letting of blood, sweat, and tears, Taylor’s inability to generate grit or grain makes his earnest pleadings incapable of provoking any emotion other than the vague sense you could stand to buy more expensive shoes. He cries “it’s called home video” during “The Wheel”, Abel Tesfaye minus the all-in conviction in his debaucherous anti-seduction. And then you have the half-hearted metaphor of “Veto”, either Tom Krell or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"">Arthur Ashin</a> without their demonstrative, fearless emoting. During “Paralysed”, he rends his clothes while bemoaning his tangled intestines and being left dead on the roadside; it's meant as <i>Tremors' </i>centerpiece and can only muster the emotional resonance of a series of <a href=""https://twitter.com/Mozzer_bot"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Mozz-bot</a> Tweets.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Tremors</i> is actually kinda intriguing in a “canary in the coalmine” sort of way. It’s going to be framed as an “indie” record and in closing, take some time to thank yourself because Taylor couldn’t have done it without you. Think of what had to be overcome for this happen: literally decades worth of antipathy towards synthesizers, mistrust of acts incorporating R&amp;B and pop, a side-eye towards vocal technical prowess, good old American provincialism. It does represent a weird kind of progress in establishing equality, almost heartening that all of these exciting fusions can result in “indie” albums based in pop and R&amp;B and electronic music that are every bit as dull as your average <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement"">Pavement</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo"">Yo La Tengo</a> derivative from 1996.</p></div>"|19202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19202-sohn-tremors/|5.0|Ian Cohen

Both acts seek new sounds and ideas via percussion, and both embrace devout repetition as a tool for finding unbeaten paths. Granted, they’ve arrived at that task from different angles: Man Forever is </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"">Oneida</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> drummer </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17456-kid-millions/"">Kid Millions</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> alongside many partners from the underground rock world, while So Percussion is a quartet of former Yale grad students who perform works by heavyweights like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27568-david-lang/"">David Lang</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. But both share a vision of percussion as exploratory and expansive rather than supplementary.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In fact, their visions are so expansive that combining them could be too much of a good thing. There’s already a lot to absorb in the respective work of Man Forever and So Percussion, so their big, active sounds might crowd each other, perhaps even cancel each other out. Neither happens on </span><i>Ryonen</i><span>, which spreads 30 minutes of music across two tracks. There’s clarity throughout, even when drums overlap and rhythms blur, as well as a precision that gives a sense of purpose to every move. The whole isn’t greater than the sum of its parts; that’d be too much to expect of two entities with such high-quality individual track records. But </span><i>Ryonen </i><span>is an engaging first strike.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What makes it engaging is its continual forward motion. Both pieces are loop-based, their cores formed by cycles of percussion that repeat for long stretches. Yet both also make progress, rarely dragged down by the weight of their over-and-over beats. Part of this progress comes from sonic variety: multiple types of drums and cymbals are employed, and one piece requires that each instrument be played ""in a different time signature at the same tempo.” But progress also comes in the way participants use energy to create kinetic waves. They’re able to make the same figure sound different through the intensity and force of their playing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Those waves are most obvious on opener “The Clear Realization,” since the percussion recedes to let in a dreamy voice that sounds uncannily like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5523-health/""><span>HEALTH</span></a><span>’s Jake Duzsik. Adding singing is an interesting move—I wouldn’t have guessed vocals would have anything to do with this collaboration—and the choice gives dramatic tint to a piece that’s otherwise about physicality. But it also makes “The Clear Realization” oddly light. It’s as if the musicians felt compelled to filter their ideas through something literal like speech, rather than letting the drumming do the talking. The song might be more broadly communicative as a result, but it’s also more generic.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Vocals emerge on </span><i>Ryonen</i><span>’s closing title track too, but they come much later in the game, and they’re more about adding texture than taking the lead. The percussion in turn is also more complex and subtle. It begins like a collection of offset drumrolls, but gradually masses into a growling drone, then returns even more pointed and hypnotic than it began. As hummed voices rise with the final percussion climax, “Ryonen” scales heights despite few overt, attention-grabbing changes. In doing so, it gives the collection </span><span>an ideal ending point: it's both the album's peak and a ramp Man Forever and So Percussion could use to shoot higher, if we’re lucky enough to get a second meeting of these skillful minds.</span></p></div>"|19197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19197-man-forever-ryonen/|6.8|Marc Masters

Where the quartet has traditionally treated concerts as public practice sessions to air out works-in-progress, their 2012-13 setlists charitably balanced out the <i>Hz</i> with the hits (meaning that the band’s newer fans no longer had to dial up <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzPhxYg0P-g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube clips from 2007</a> to experience “My Girls” in a live setting). This generous spirit seems to have carried over to primary vocalist Dave “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4174-avey-tare"">Avey Tare</a>” Portner’s current interim pursuit, which offers a glimpse of the kind of band Animal Collective could be if they gave into populist demand more often.</p>
<p>To date, Portner’s projects outside of Animal Collective have leaned toward the intensely introspective, whether he was making blissed-out, backward-looped soundscapes with then-wife Kría Brekkan (2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10153-pullhair-rubeye/""><i>Pullhair Rubeye</i></a>) or fractious, click ‘n’ cut digi-dirges to address their subsequent separation, the death of his grandmother, and his sister’s struggles with cancer (2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14764-down-there/""><i>Down There</i></a>). His new band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32072-avey-tares-slasher-flicks/"">Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks</a>, was born of a similarly stressful circumstance—Portner was sidelined by strep throat for a long stretch last year—but it also serves as a therapeutic, adrenalized antidote.</p>
<p>Supported by ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projector</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27671-deradoorian/"">Angel Deradoorian</a> and former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5037-ponytail/"">Ponytail</a> drummer Jeremy Hyman, Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks effectively resemble Animal Collective in stripped-down, garage-band, power-trio formation. They're not quite as densely textured and sonically adventurous, but more than capable of generating the same sense of euphoric abandon: the bouncing-ball momentum of opening track “A Sender” follows in the foot-stomps of two totemic AC openers—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/""><i>Feels</i></a>’ “Did You See the Words” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10650-strawberry-jam/""><i>Strawberry Jam</i></a>’s “Peacebone”—while “Duplex Trip” packs the woozy tropical punch of <i>Centipede Hz's </i>more<i> </i>mango-flavored material. (The sporadic flashes of high-beam harmonies from Deradoorian likewise yield a potent I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a> effect.) But Slasher Flicks gradually develop their own peculiar personality, most notably on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16620-little-fang/"">“Little Fang”</a>, the album’s lead single and the most atypical track here.</p>
<p>In contrast to the rhythmic clatter and electro squiggles that usually accompany Portner’s voice, the Slasher Flicks position ""Little Fang""’s engaging call-and-response hook atop a silken 70s soft-rock groove that resembles a bygone <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1427-electric-light-orchestra/"">ELO</a> hit refracted through a funhouse mirror (while also betraying Portner’s debt to the phantasmagoric pop of <i>Pure Guava</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"">Ween</a>). And in their most concise, frenetically funky moments— “Blind Babe”, “Modern Days E”, “Strange Colores”—Slasher Flicks pump out better <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2166-janes-addiction/"">Jane’s Addiction</a> songs than anything that band has come up since reuniting (an outcome that doesn’t seem so ridiculous when you consider Portner and Perry Farrell’s mutual appreciation of tribal-percussion, rapid-fire wordplay, and the Grateful Dead—heck, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRtDImn9fLc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Jane’s cover of “Ripple”</a> could practically pass for a dry run for ""Fireworks"").</p>
<p>As Portner admitted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9328-avey-tares-slasher-flicks/"">in a recent Pitchfork interview</a>, the Slasher Flicks concept was born of a desire to mess around with the sort of 60s garage-rock and horror-movie tropes that yielded novelty hits like “Monster Mash.” (For more on this phenomenon, watch <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo4tzrxyXsA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this disturbing documentary</a>.) On <i>Enter the Slasher House</i>, that influence proves to be mostly implicit. You won’t find any ditties here about ghouls and ghosts hosting graveyard soirees, but the songs craftily split the difference between cheeky and creepy, pitting innocent nursery-rhyme-like melodies against mutating, hallucinogenic backdrops. (The ecstatic Afro-pop of “Catchy (Was Contagious)” even serves as a reminder of how the terminology used to describe a song’s likability factor can also be applied to communicable diseases.)</p>
<p><i>Slasher House</i> actually becomes a lot less inviting in those moments where it lays on the carnivalistic clamor and shock tactics too thick; when would-be centerpiece tracks like “That It Won’t Grow” and “The Outlaw” start bashing their half-baked choruses into submission with all the subtlety of an oversized cartoon mallet, the album threatens to just turn into <i>Millipede Hz</i>. Compared to the revelatory melodicism on display in songs like “Little Fang”, it’s a bit wearying to hear Portner revert to an esophagus-shredding yelp as his default mechanism whenever the songs seem to be running out of gas. Perhaps the act of screaming himself hoarse is Portner’s way of saying “fuck you” to strep throat, but <i>Enter</i> works best when it's not begging for an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ENT</a>. </p></div>"|19200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19200-avey-tares-slasher-flicks-enter-the-slasher-house/|7.3|Stuart Berman

OFF! were full of life, and they were boiling hardcore down to its most essential elements—Morris' wide-eyed vocal performance, lyrics that cut directly to the point, guitarist Dimitri Coats' intimidation and muscle, and an abrupt halt at the moment the song ended. They possess the ability to economize without even sounding like they're trying, and although listening to the collection's physical edition forced you to get off your ass every couple of minutes to throw on the next 7"", it was worth the effort.</p>
<p>Two years later, OFF! followed those 16 songs with 16 more on their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16603-off/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">self-titled LP</a>. <i>OFF!</i> was a good album, even if the songs weren't quite as strong as the ones that made their debut such a revelation. Their latest album, <i>Wasted Years</i>, adds another 16 tracks to the band's catalog; at 23 minutes, it's their longest album, and even though this is a band that does ""fast"" really well, the added eight minutes threaten to completely bog down this new one.</p>
<p>The elements at play are largely familiar ones—the overall sound hasn't changed much and Morris is still screaming stuff like ""You need to be exorcised""—so the question stands: when's the exact moment when <i></i>OFF!'s discography dips from ""exciting"" to merely ""good""? I'll argue that it's the 47-second mark of <i>Wasted Years</i>' ""Red White and Black"", which begins with screeching feedback and a breakneck, biting attack before breaking into a slow chug. By the time they kick into overdrive again, any initial excitement the track conjured feels squandered, and the song's momentum is lost.</p>
<p>Lost momentum is a fairly common occurance on <i>Wasted Years</i>. ""Hypnotized"", their longest track to date clocking in at 2:15, feels like a slog coming after ""Over Our Heads"", which finds Morris screaming, ""There's no free lunch for a jackass"". Too often, OFF!<i> </i>do something exciting before plopping a sluggish song into the mix, which might come off as a petty grievance if OFF!'s most powerful songs didn't possess the duality of sounding vicious <i>and</i> effortlessly pared back. Considering their track record thus far, it's surprising that what <i>Wasted Years</i> feels like it needs most is some careful editing.</p>
<p>Still, the songs on <i>Wasted Years</i> aren't out-and-out <i>bad</i>. ""All I Can Grab"" features an all-muscle hook with Morris lyrically taking the viewpoint of the greedy, a shift from his usual position of the guy who's admonishing the greedy: ""All by design, I'll take what's mine/ First your money, then your mind!"" ""Death Trip on the Party Train"" features a brief psychedelic guitar breakdown that works well in the context of the song and doesn't overstay its welcome, proving that OFF! are able to experiment beyond their winning formula and succeed regardless. Despite its scattered high points, though, it's hard not to think of <i>Wasted Years</i> as little more than the third most exciting OFF! record.</p></div>"|19151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19151-off-wasted-years/|6.2|Evan Minsker

But it's apparent that when one engages with pop-punk, it’s less of a “phase” than a vaccination—a crucial inoculation that makes you immune to it for the rest of your life, presumably for society's benefit. So it’s not surprising that pop-punk isn’t afforded the same cachet amongst critics as similarly youth-oriented genres: after all, there’s nothing subversive or cool about your 13-year-old self, and there haven’t been many examples of its practitioners aging gracefully.</p>
<p>But why hasn’t pop-punk aged with its listeners without devolving into bloated classic rock, tentative maturity or sad, keep on keepin’ on nostalgia? Is it the music itself that loses its effect? What is it about pop-punk’s forthright melodicism and tendency towards plainspoken, true-to-life lyrics that don't translate to adulthood? These are necessary points to consider, because with <i>Oh, Common Life</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32096-fireworks/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Fireworks</a> have made an exceedingly catchy pop-punk record that candidly and intelligently grapples with the same struggles of adulthood you might expect from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">National</a>.</p>
<p>The Detroit quintet's third LP is pop-punk for the same reasons that determine most genre affiliations—pedigree and presentation. There are enormous instant-singalong melodies here that could potentially trigger gag reflexes, but they unify a record of expansive range and clever writing. While the tambourine-shaking hook of “Bed Sores” beams with the summer sun clarity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2195-jimmy-eat-world/"">Jimmy Eat World</a>'s<i> Bleed American</i>, the call-and-response between the ascending vocal lines and descending guitar leads during the verse could be outsourced from a Squeeze song. There’s caustic, shoegaze dissonance droning through the slippery-when-wet power balladry of “The Back Window’s Down”, while “The Only Thing That Haunts This House Is Me” manages the lyrical and melodic bite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Elvis Costello</a>. It still hits the same teen-friendly pleasure centers of <i>Oh, Common Life's</i> more puritanical predecessor <i>Gospel</i>, but this isn’t “try this at home” stuff for novice musicians.</p>
<p>As compositionally impressive as Fireworks have become, it’s the maturation of David Mackinder’s lyricism that provides a rare vitality to <i>Oh, Common Life</i> that lends the record both depth and breadth. It’s in a similar space as last year’s <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, a landmark release by Fireworks’ tourmates the Wonder Years, where one frames their own doubts and failings in the context of their family’s historical struggles: World War II, the Detroit riots, teenage parenthood, immigration and the grim inheritance of assumed upward mobility. Both the Wonder Years' Dan Campbell and Mackinder are relative veterans who gravitated towards a reaction to their suburban upbringings defined by marriage, children, homeownership, and security. But now that they’re staring down 30, success in a young man’s game has left them to wonder if their parents were actually onto something about where one derives true substance in life.</p>
<p>So even as Mackinder’s voice maintains the Sour Patch Kid acidity it exuded on earlier tracks like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOcJXWVda3I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Dave Mackinder vs. the World”</a>, the lyrics on <i>Oh, Common Life</i> heartbreakingly demonstrate the crushing admittance of defeat, such as the moments before the glammed-up chorus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16656-glowing-crosses/"">""Glowing Crosses""</a>: “Always thought I was headed somewhere/ Never thought I’d just <i>end up</i>.”  <i>Oh, Common Life </i>is one of the most legitimately sad records I’ve come across of late, its irrepressible tunefulness never deflecting the pain within or mocking it, instead signifying a resilience reflecting the reality that the world doesn’t stop for your crises regardless of impotent longing (“The Back Window’s Down”), alcoholic escape (“Flies on Tape”), and self-pity (“One More Creature Dizzy With Love”).</p>
<p>Because of its pop-punk trappings, there is a good chance <i>Oh, Common Life</i> will be dismissed by some: every song wants to be <i>the</i> single (some during the second half don't quite get there) and those reared on <i>real </i>indie rock might have to avert their ears to the production’s blinding sheen. Spend enough time around this stuff, though, and those aspects don't smack of cynicism or careerism, but out of accountability to people who gravitate towards this music: not just ""kids"", but post-grads with real debts, normal jobs and steady lives outside major media centers being told <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Vampire Weekend</a>, ""Girls"", and <i>Frances Ha</i> are definitive documents of their generation rather than accurate representations of the subcultures responsible for them. Not that those are the only people who should find something to love here—Fireworks hit home with anyone who feels like they’re operating without a net, so for those who have already gotten their pop-punk vaccination, <i>Oh, Common Life</i> is a necessary booster shot.</p></div>"|19196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19196-fireworks-oh-common-life/|7.8|Ian Cohen

The pinball-like grindcore lasts for less than 90 seconds, the band ultimately snapping into silence beneath the decaying contortions of frontman Doug Moore. It’s an aggressive introduction, a road sign that proclaims, “Welcome to the Wonderful, Terrifying World of Pyrrhon.” But “The Oracle of Nassau” serves as a successful screen test, too, an offering of bona fides meant to prove that, if all else fails, this band can come direct and fast, hard and mean. The move allows them to play most everything <i>but </i>straightforward death or doom, hardcore or noise rock for the subsequent 50 minutes of their excellent second album. Instead, they push those elements together to craft complicated, dense, and personal tantrums that, as intended, lash at the bounds of strict genre acceptability. </p>
<p>That, more or less, is the implicit point of Pyrrhon, a “technical death metal” group that seems much less interested in proving their physical dexterity, however impressive it may be, than espousing mental wherewithal through sets of alien contortions and chimeras. Not unlike clear inspirations Gorguts or Demilich, Pyrrhon seem set on proving their worth <i>inside </i>metal while simultaneously working their way outside the form, too. “I’m not arrogant enough to describe our approach as the future of metal, but I consider Pyrrhon part of a broader effort to expand and develop the genre,” <a href=""http://metalrecusants.com/2012/01/12/interview-doug-of-pyrrhon/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moore said in a 2012 interview with <i>MetalRecusants</i></a>. “Our primary concern is expanding the definition…without losing its fiery spirit.” In the three years that have passed since the release of their debut, <a href=""http://pyrrhonband.bandcamp.com/album/the-mother-of-virtues"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>An Excellent Servant but a Terrible Master</i></a>, not only has the band signed to Relapse, but they’ve also seemed to stretch their interests <i>and</i> their ability to link them. In 2011, they were a metal band with other, less-obvious musical interests; in 2014, those other interests serve as the springboard for one of the year’s most inclusive and delightfully challenging gauntlets.</p>
<p>Nowhere is all this more apparent than “White Flag”, the album’s second track. If “The Oracle of Nassau” was meant to prove Pyrrhon’s skills and force, these thesis-like 10 minutes are meant to showcase instead Pyrrhon’s smarts and finesse. The band turns down at the start, a torpid beat waltzing through a cabinet-rattling bassline. The easy opening offers an empty canvas, which the quartet fills with wrenched guitars and ravaged vocals and then crinkles with a rhythm section that speeds up only to slow down, and vice versa. Pyrrhon create tension by writing outward from what seems to be the song’s core; that is, every time you start to find the direction of “White Flag”, you notice that Dylan DiLella’s guitar is running countercurrent to that momentum or ignoring it altogether. At some points, drummer Alex Cohen and bassist Erik Malave share a nervous system, as they switch between turbid sludge and frantic outbursts without hesitation; other times, they peel apart entirely, the bass lowly sulking as the drums sprint ahead. Even as “White Flag” ends on a slow, evil crawl toward the exit, Cohen adds a steady blast beat in the background, teasing an eruption that never comes. It’s a masterpiece of defiance and escalation, a master plan for all the ways Pyrrhon works past its prescribed realm during the rest of <i>The Mother of Virtues</i>.</p>
<p>Those intentions unfold in sometimes surprising ways throughout <i>The Mother of Virtues</i>: “The Parasite in Winter”, for instance, might first feel rather rote. But amid the lashing drums and pinprick leads, Pyrrhon makes the trip seem like a demented amusement park ride, where a guitar solo leads first to a lysergic abyss and then into a depraved circus where Michael Gira works as the ringmaster. The terrific “Balkanized”, which takes a train’s click-clack beat as its backbone, interrupts its feeling of complete claustrophobia with a psychedelic comedown that suggests electric Miles Davis. “Eternity in a Breath” moves with the same steely resolve and eventual phosphorescence as Slint’s “Good Morning, Captain,” albeit refracted like evening sunlight slipping through thick clouds. DiLella functions as a pinwheel of ideas and enthusiasms here. In only minutes, he conjures shimmering West African guitar music, twinkling classicism, writhing no wave, and suffocating doom.</p>
<p>Moore supplies a related versatility, too. He is the mouthpiece that reiterates the restlessness of the band at his back. He’s capable of occasionally dropping into a bottom-barrel Chris Barnes bellow or lashing out in barely decipherable, squealing invective. His best moments might come, though, when he foregrounds his other inspirations. Though the band rips through “Invisible Injury”, with guitars lacing like electrical wire through a rigid and technical rhythm section, Moore sounds not like a heavy metal hero but more like David Yow. “I’m trying hard not to feel ungrateful,” he yells to launch the song’s back half, his voice pinned between the band’s muscles like an early Touch &amp; Go hero hanging around the wrong set of tough guys. “But it can really get you down, man.” Too bad about his frustrations, but at least they’ve inspired an interesting and audacious record.</p></div>"|19074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19074-pyrrhon-the-mother-of-virtues/|7.7|Grayson Haver Currin

A typical Gordan composition is built from a small ensemble of tense, pickled sounds that circle each other warily. Neither demanding your attention nor slinking to the background, Gordan's music lingers nearby. Indeed, it is music most easily described by noting what it is not: neither ambient nor disruptive, noisy nor calm, avant-garde nor conformist. Music that exists in this beguiling statelessness is usually onto something, though it's difficult to grasp what that might be from Gordan's debut long player, <i>Exits</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The most impressive aspect of <i>Exits</i> is how few signposts it offers you as a listener. This is music made largely with inherently referential samples and familiar-sounding synthesizers, but <i>Exits</i> dwells in its own space. One of the ways Gordan achieves this is by excising the human voice. <i>Exits</i> features occasional wordless chatter and, on ""Howl"", a careening cheer, but this is sampladelic music that largely ignores anything human or relatable. When <i>Exits</i> does offer an explicit musical clue—the carnival bounce of ""Howl"", the punchless acid of ""IIVA""—that clue is mangled and dark. The dubby suspensions of ""Hex"" and ""Fissure"" are the best examples of how <i>Exits</i> settles into spaces as it plays, requiring little of you but present nonetheless.</p>
<p>Gordan's sound is not without precedent. His chosen moniker—a silly one, really—offers a clue, as he can count witch-y sound manglers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"">Balam Acab</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28736-ooooo/"">oOoOO</a> as kin, especially on ""Ellum Tonal""'s bleary-eyed comedown. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a>'s dusty occultism is another touchstone, though <i>Exits</i> isn't as stylish and fully formed as that duo's best work. Gordan's work lacks the immersion that those produces offer: his short tracks move in and out of ideas quickly, resisting engagement or sustained exploration.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This brevity works in his favor, mostly. At 38 minutes <i>Exits</i> is the right length to be taken in whole, and its short, quivering tracks don't make sense in any other context. You will not walk away from this experience changed: <i>Exits</i> keeps to itself, never conjuring real dread or darkness, too slight and self-contained to make a larger point about sound or sampling or abstraction. Gordan's ability to perplex sets him apart but does not by itself lend <i>Exits</i> substance. Count <i>Exits</i> as a curiosity, an early one, from a producer who will likely be capable of more.</p></div>"|19207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19207-loops-haunt-exits/|6.6|Andrew Gaerig

When an <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2012/08/24/todd-terje-on-primitive-drum-programming-nasal-surgery-and-inspectors-norse-and-morse/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviewer</a> asked him what he thought about the radio station's description, Terje said he agreed with it. ""It sounds like elevator music. Good, danceable elevator music."" Then, in a pun fit only for hypothetical dads, he added, ""Elevate your body!"" In Terje's world, there is no distinction made between beating and joining—it's all join, join, join.</p>
<p><i>It's Album Time</i> is, as advertised, his first full-length album. The title sets the tone: Casual, confident, and unburdened by the imagined need for significance that scares so many good dance producers into losing their cool when given a bigger platform. Most of the music on it could be classified as<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMXSmikJHDU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> disco</a>, with shades of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMXSmikJHDU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cocktail lounge</a>, exotica, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBYdp84AwuU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">surf instrumentals</a>, and other styles that favor whimsy and novelty over sober artistic expression. Not that Terje isn't an artist—he is, and a careful one, fluent in history, expert with texture, and with a grasp on composition more akin to a 1960s film composer than a contemporary techno producer. But for as much ground as he covers on <i>It's Album Time</i>, the music feels effortless, gliding from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjq0WDvapow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Henry Mancini-esque detective jazz</a> to bouncy, Stevie Wonder funk like breeze blowing through the waffle weave of a leisure suit. Conventional wisdom bears out: The looser the grip, the tighter the hold.</p>
<p>Despite recycling four of its twelve tracks from previously released singles and EPs, <i>It's Album Time</i> has a linear, cohesive feel. Instead of trying to top <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15595-todd-terje-strandbar-disko/"">""Strandbar""</a> or ""Inspector Norse"", Terje ties them together with short interstitial tracks—valleys that give perspective to the mountains. If he ever capitulates to the conventions of making a full-length album, it's in structure, which here is less redolent of disco than classic-rock pranksters like Paul McCartney or Frank Zappa: an introduction that features men whispering the words ""It's album time"" repeatedly, peaking with a ballad halfway through; closing with the joyous ""Inspector Norse"", and dying away to the sound of distant applause.</p>
<p>Terje is, at heart, a comedian. ""I like my music very fruity,"" he told Resident Advisor in 2007. ""Lots of percussion, lots of silly effects."" When I <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?2045"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> the illustrator Bendik Kaltenborn, who has drawn the covers for most of Terje's releases including <i>It's Album Time</i>, he told me that the two first bonded over what Kaltenborn called a ""Stupid"" sense of humor. Everything about <i>It's Album Time</i> and Terje's self-presentation—whether it's the fart-like synth sounds, the conga-line enthusiasm, or the <a href=""http://goldenscissors.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/The-Bangles-Dub-like-an-Egyptian-Todd-Terje-edit.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promo photos of him flexing his minor biceps with a pout on his face</a>—is so studiously carefree that he sometimes seems less like a human being than an all-night party incarnate.  </p>
<p>But like all comedy, Terje's act is held together by a taut thread of sadness. The beauty of his music is the beauty of a neon sign outside a cheap motel: It's kitschy but it knows it, and in its kitsch conveys both loneliness (it's dark outside and you've been driving for hours) and its easy resolution (it's warm inside and happy hour never ends, pink paper umbrella gratis). In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/13-music-videos/223-todd-terje-inspector-norse-official-music-video/"" target=""_blank"">the mockumentary-style video</a> for Terje's ""Inspector Norse"" (which is excerpted from a Norwegian short film called <a href=""http://vimeo.com/58444378"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Whateverest</i></a>), a failed electronic musician living with his elderly father in a small town spends a day bowling and cooking drugs from household chemicals before turning out the lights and dancing to ""Inspector Norse"", alone. Afterwards, he wanders the streets in facepaint, confused, crying. He survives mostly on illusions, and without happy music, he'd be lost.</p>
<p>The album's least representative song is the one that sticks with me the most: A cover of the Robert Palmer ballad <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkIfMfWKYBA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Johnny and Mary,""</a> sung by Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry. The song is heavy, melancholic, and almost oppressively romantic—moods that the rest of <i>It's Album Time</i> feel designed to make you forget about. The lyrics tell the story of a couple who know they're alienated from each other but have hung on for so long they struggle with whether or not to break up. ""Johnny's always running around, trying to find certainty,"" the opening line goes. ""He needs all the world to confirm that he ain't lonely/ Mary counts the walls, knows he tires easily.""</p>
<p>Ferry has spent his entire career crying <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSniBxXjK_8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crocodile tears</a>, exploring the ways a seemingly insincere performance can ring with more feeling and pathos than something we recognize as ""real"". His voice—once a dazzling, cartoonish instrument, like Elvis with his finger in a wall socket—sounds hollowed-out and whispery, an old man whose wisdom brings him no comfort. In the original song, Palmer seems to hover above the characters, observing them, maybe even judging. Ferry sounds like he's in the next room, suffering troubles of his own.</p>
<p>As the song crests and the rippling arpeggios of Terje's synths reach their climax, you might wonder: What is a song so sad doing on an album so relentlessly upbeat? Not to ruin the mood, I think—only as a reminder that sadness is a choice. You could be ""Inspector Norse"" if you wanted to, peacocking wild across the dancefloor, spilling drinks on a stranger, recognizing the brevity of life by enjoying it. From an artist like Terje, it's proof that he could go deep if he wanted to. He'd just rather have fun.  </p></div>"|19148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19148-todd-terje-its-album-time/|8.7|Mike Powell

The songs ranged from anthemic and rafter-reaching to churning and bleak, grounded by frontman Joe Casey's deep, looming vocals that moved seamlessly from a croon to a deranged bark. It was an impressive showing of both mastery and versatility.</p>
<p>On their follow-up, <i>Under Color of Official Right</i>, they've cleaned up their sound a bit and sanded down a few of their rough edges without becoming tepid or tame. This time around, the band's embraced a consistent ebb and flow, continually shifting back and forth from simmer to full-boil. For listeners well-versed in <i>No Passion</i>'s steadfast ferocity, this new one<i> </i>may appear comparatively declawed, but the more subtle approach comes with more tonal and emotional nuance. Greg Ahee's ringing, hollow guitar clack on ""Bad Advice"" gives weight and urgency to a narrative <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Kilpatrick#2012.E2.80.932013_felony_corruption_trial_and_conviction"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick</a>, while the tenderness of Scott Davidson's slow-burning bass intro on ""What the Wall Said"" is a perfect counterbalance to an imminent and overwhelming barrage of guitars. ""Come &amp; See"" begins with guitar chords that are given space to ring before being enveloped by huge, oppressive waves of guitars, and the effect is oddly uplifting. The hooks are diverse in mood—dark, subtle, playful—but just as cohesive and powerful as they were on their first outing.</p>
<p>As they did with <i>No Passion</i>, Protomartyr seal the deal with Casey's lyrics. Often inspired by books and news stories and filtered through the band's deadpan abstractions, they don't always make perfect sense right away. Album opener ""Maidenhead"" is directly influenced by Patrick Hamilton's black comedy novel <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangover_Square"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Hangover Square</i></a>. It's about George Harvey Bone, a lonely alcoholic who suffers from spells where he feels no pleasure or pain. Casey sings about a ""clack"" in his brain, which triggers ""dead moods"". At the chorus, drummer Alex Leonard and Ahee ramp up their attack, and when things cool down again, Casey sings, ""Maidenhead, here I come,"" referring to the happy place where Bone longs to return—where he can finally find respite from the darkness. ""I have arrived.""</p>
<p>But here's the hitch: When Bone reaches Maidenhead in the book, he <i>isn't</i> peaceful there—he's just as tortured as he always was. And as Protomartyr push out into the rest of their album, they're still mired in darkness. They outline betrayal, treason, extortion, corruption, bad dads, insufferable randos, and of course, violence. It's tempting to comb through the album to find clues that reveal Casey's initial inspirations, but going line by line and decoding its ""secrets"" is about as arbitrary a practice as naming every sample on a Girl Talk album: it's nice to know the details, but look at the big picture instead. The overall strength of <i>Under Color of Official Right</i> doesn't come from its big words, Detroit cred, or works-cited page; it's from lyrics that, while fraught with symbolism, feel emotionally resonant and, sometimes, viscerally unpleasant. If you listen carefully to Casey's voice, this stuff can hit hard.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's the seething, self-assured vocals, but the album's most bleak phrases are also some of its most memorable. ""Stumbling around for a hand in the dark/ Slapping you down, choking you out,"" he casually croons on ""What the Wall Said"". A vengeful son kills off a pack of barfly dads in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16482-protomartyr-scum-rise/"">""Scum, Rise!""</a>, while Davidson locks into a rollicking groove during ""Tarpeian Rock"", named for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpeian_Rock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ancient Roman cliff</a> where murderers and traitors were flung for their crimes. Casey lists the different sorts of people who should meet their demise—emotional cripples, internet personas, rich crusties, adults dressed as children, and so on—while his swirling, primal vocals insist, ""THROW THEM FROM THE ROCK"".</p>
<p>Amid all the chaos and fuzz, the album's crown jewel might be ""Violent""—the most calm, spare track of the bunch. It's a bedtime story with multiple layers: a bandit about to kill a man for snoring too loud, a dark shape in the water that's about to sink a boat, a husband poisoning his wife, cats hunting mice, dogs eating their young. ""If it's violent, it's understood,"" sings Casey, and that's the reality they present throughout <i>Under Color of Official Right: n</i>o matter where you look—in books, at your loved ones, at your pets, at the sports bar—there's violence and death and destruction. It's a bummer, but at least Protomartyr wrote and recorded an impressive album around that idea.</p></div>"|19150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19150-protomartyr-under-color-of-official-right/|8.1|Evan Minsker

The results of this formula are, more often than not, broadly appealing; at the least, it makes good background music for parties or cocktail bars.</p>
<p>There's a host of new acts that fit this format, but only one comes with a cartoon world full of characters such as the <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/gwUveDqWQ3/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grateful Bat</a> (that is, a sardonic-looking hippie bat). Self-described as a “music and art project”, Young &amp; Sick is the musical project of Nick Van Hofwegen, a Dutch artist who's designed album covers for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29788-foster-the-people/"">Foster the People</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6519-maroon-5/"">Maroon 5</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7719-robin-thicke/"">Robin Thicke</a>. As a visual artist, Van Hofwegen's style is whimsical and fun; musically, he's headed in a similarly upbeat direction.</p>
<p>Expanding on the few ethereal tracks he released semi-anonymously online over the past few years<i>, Young &amp; Sick</i> is a remarkably polished debut, with each song boasting careful, painstaking arrangements and adept uses of space. It's charming, undeniable music that bops its way out onto the dancefloor with relaxed charm, and it shimmers with the seductive murmur of a lounge staple. It fits a specific vibe, and that's about the extent of what <i>Young &amp; Sick</i> has to offer.</p>
<p>Album opener ""Mangrove"" is particularly vacuous—“When life is smiling at me/ Why do I frown?”—and there's not much else lyrically that goes beyond vague relationship talk or idle, sweet nothings. Regardless, this approach occasionally yields pleasant results. “Counting Raindrops” is a smoldering, romantic number over a taut syncopated that represents the album's strongest moment, even if lyrics like “When the sun goes under/ No one makes me feel like you do” lacks a certain soul-baring expressiveness. Musically, <i>Young &amp; Sick</i> exists on a similar plane: everything sounds perfectly in place, and “Nowhere” and “Glass” bristle with a restrained energy and provide justification for indie rock's ongoing rejection of the electric guitars and drum kits in favor of synthesizers and drum machines.</p>
<p>It might seem unfair to discuss <i>Young &amp; Sick</i> by rattling off other music that its songs sound like—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2229-junior-boys/"">Junior Boys</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9301-so-this-is-goodbye/""><i>So This Is Goodbye</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4805-nelly-furtado"">Nelly Furtado</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JnGBs88sL0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Say It Right""</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3139-of-montreal/"">of Montreal</a>'s funkier moments—but it does seem like the project's aim is little more than trying on familiar sounds. There is some tension—“I can't seem to shake the feeling/ The sky is falling and I'm alone,” Van Hofwegen sings on ""Twentysomething""—but it's quickly swept under the rug by cheery instrumentation, driving home the album's overall message: whatever youthful afflictions may be out there, music is a reliable balm.</p></div>"|19220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19220-young-sick-young-sick/|6.3|Kyle Kramer

In general, it’s far more concerned with texture than rhythm or tune, so it meets the genre’s main requirements. But the description doesn’t <i>completely</i> fit. By definition an ambient record, even a great one, is supposed to be able to function as aural wallpaper (and be “as ignorable as it is interesting,” according to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>), but even at its most tranquil moments <i>Visibility</i> refuses to fade into the background. While it has some genuinely blissful passages, it’s mostly just unsettling in a way that’s difficult to pin down—if it was actually wallpaper, you’d swear you could catch its patterns shifting in your peripheral vision.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Unsettling” has been the duo’s default mode ever since releasing the 2012 EP <i>Mitchell Heisman</i>, named after a man who committed suicide in 2010 and left behind a 1,900 page exposition on the nature of human existence as way of a suicide note. <i>Visibility</i> is a subtler work, from its titular reference—a line from Michel Foucault’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Discipline and Punish</i></a> in a passage regarding Jeremy Bentham’s <i>Panopticon</i>, a prison where inmates are never out of their supervisors’ view—on down.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Foucault reference establishes a paranoid dread that Alex Ander and Marc Dall spend four songs probing and building on with a palette of druggy synth pads and woozy sub-bass deep enough that it might actually be capable of messing with your inner ear. (There’s also a remix by Regis of “He Was Human And Belonged With Humans"", from last year’s <i>An Ambassador For Laing</i> LP.) Ander and Dall are so good at setting an ominous mood that when they shatter the tension on track three, “Sight of Hirta"", by dropping in the EP’s only real beat—a stuttering, stroboscopic thing that slides around a straight dance rhythm but never sticks—almost a traumatic experience.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Visibility</i> is supposed to be inspired by Dall’s interest in the self-help and anti-psychiatry movement, particularly in the Scottish psychiatrist R.D. Laing, whose views on the nature of mental illness—and his insistence that the emotional and mental experiences of the mentally ill shouldn’t be treated simply as pathologies—made him an outcast in his profession but a hero to anti-psychiatry activists. Laing, anti-psychiatry, and self-help all figured into the '70s New Age movement, and, with its plentiful pads and lack of drums, <i>Visibility</i> often evokes New Age music, as well as a general macrame-encrusted hippie-dippy vibe—The burbly synths on “Active Discovering” sound like they could have been pulled from an especially out-there block of programming on PBS during my childhood in the Me Decade’s afterglow. But Dall and Ander like to subvert that feeling as soon as they establish it, and by its halfway point the song’s dissonant elements have accumulated into a sinister edge.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick, Ander and Dall are happy to present their audience with a bunch of ambiguities that they leave hanging in the air at the end. Their refusal to let the record resolve itself into something that can be easily sorted or explained makes it easy to play it on repeat, trying to find a new angle to approach it from.</span></p></div>"|19149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19149-dalhous-visibility-is-a-trap/|7.4|Miles Raymer

Starting with the Mekons’ 1985 album <i>Fear and Whiskey</i>, folk and country have played large parts in almost all of Langford’s releases, both with the Mekons and on his many side projects such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4540-waco-brothers/"">Waco Brothers</a> and the Pine Valley Cosmonauts. It’s his solo albums, though, that have been the most intimate showcases of Langford’s fascination with Americana. From the cantankerous, country-sucks-today rabblerousing of 2004’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4681-all-the-fame-of-lofty-deeds/""><i>All the Fame of Lofty Deeds</i></a> to the honky-tonk-infused frolic of 2010’s <i>Old Devils</i>, Langford keeps a taut leash on tradition.</p>
<p>So “Summer Stars,” a song from <i>Here Be Monsters</i>, Langford’s new solo album with his backing band Skull Orchard (a revolving ensemble named after his 1998 solo debut), comes as a surprise. It begins with an eerie science-fiction monologue—calling to mind that Langford’s older brother David is a renowned sci-fi author specializing in satire and pastiche—that lovingly taps into the space-glam wondrousness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"">T. Rex</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>. Langford’s voice remains gruff and gregarious, a tattered flag still happily flapping over a landscape littered with the bones of his contemporaries who didn’t make it.</p>
<p>He later covers <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UQt06qp_Jo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Don’t Believe”</a>, a sparse and frostbitten meditation on faithlessness from the Slits member Viv Albertine's 2012 solo debut <i>The Vermilion Border</i>. As a show of post-punk solidarity, it’s downright heartwarming, and it’s not the album’s only trace of latent Anglophilia. ""What Did You Do In The War?” lurches and laments like a lost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4221-richard-thompson/"">Richard</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5418-linda-thompson/"">Linda Thompson</a> B-side, complete with a give-and-take duet courtesy of piercing guest vocalist Tawny Newsome; “Gone Without Trace” is an upbeat, practically rollicking pub-pop anthem straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/449-billy-bragg/"">Billy Bragg</a>’s playbook. Elsewhere, genre distinctions melt in the simmering melancholy of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1x2rMkckxY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Mars”</a>, the album’s slowest and most tension-riddled track. The song's a bookend to “Summer Stars” that subtracts gravity from the proceedings and lets Langford’s hoarse whispers, his plaintive guitar twang, and Jean Cook’s mournful violin hang in midair, harrowingly unresolved.</p>
<p>Still, Americana has not lost its grip on Langford, nor vice versa. A thread of ragged, country-rock glory runs through “Sugar on Your Tongue”, a tender paean to bittersweet regret, and—in what seems to be Langford’s fixation on g-forces (or the lack thereof)—the dusty, tumbleweed-like drift of “Weightless.” The subject matter represents a loose theme in Langford’s work that stretches all the way back to the Mekons’ Sally Timms-sung ballad <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HNx45CCcG4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Ghosts of American Astronauts”</a>; even on “Summer Stars,” the song’s Major Tom-esque narrator cites not Bowie, but one of Langford’s more obvious Stateside heroes: “From the North down to the South/ Hank Williams' mouth will fill the sky”. Williams’ voice has certainly loomed large in Langford’s horizons for a long time now, along with those of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Johnny Cash</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14459-bob-wills/"">Bob Wills</a>, and many of the other country legends that he's absorbed and digested over the decades. The dilution of purist fidelity makes <i>Here Be Monsters</i> one of Langford’s least focused albums in recent memory, but it also ends up as one of his richest.</p></div>"|19217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19217-jon-langford-here-be-monsters/|7.0|Jason Heller

The producer's credited on that album's stirring <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMoHezlA0a0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, which flipped jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal's early '70s cut <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApjL8YZvOIU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Swahililand”</a> in ways unheard of since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a> turned the first few bars of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMnfji7KLjg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Misdemeanor”</a> into the pacing tension of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1678-gang-starr/"">Gang Starr</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45QOPG_XkOM&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Soliloquy of Chaos”</a>. But the relationship between De La and Dilla went deeper than that: when Posdnuos declared that “The Native Tongues have officially been reinstated,” he might as well have been predicting the Dilla-heavy braintrust of the Soulquarians that the alt-rap baton would be passed to.</span></p>
<p>2004's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2208-the-grind-date/""><i> The Grind Date </i></a> featured the Dilla-produced single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeHAReaNTfI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Shoomp”</a>, but after a year and a half passed, De La's future was uncertain and James Yancey passed away. In the eight years since, it's easy to wonder what might have been. De La Soul's maturing, grown-wiser <i>Art Official Intelligence </i>years and Dilla's early '00s expansions into avant-funk brilliance should've overlapped more than they actually did; it's possible that such an affiliation would've provided a stable identity for a group that was already rejecting pigeonholes and preconceptions by their death-declaring sophomore album. So the new mixtape featuring unreleased Dilla beats and reworked lyrics from De La Soul's catalog, <i>Smell the D.A.I.S.Y.—</i>the acronym retrofitting their '89 iconography to stand for “DA Inner Soul of Yancey”—provides an alternate-history look into a meaningful partnership.</p>
<p>""Alternate history,” in this case, means alternate takes on material that fans have already long since familiarized themselves with—a scenario that's less enticing than all-new lyrics over super-obscure Dilla beats. It's disorienting to hear the much-loved verses from “Plug Tunin'” or “Fanatic of the B Word” rattled off by the gruffer, heavier voices of '00s-and-later Pos and Dove, especially when they've been tweaked with switched-up flows, altered lyrics, and even shifted sentiments. So it makes more sense to think of <i>Smell the D.A.I.S.Y. </i>as a studio-bound tribute show-slash-remix album; cast in this light, the reinterpretations are refreshing, proving that even lyrics written a quarter-century ago hold up without too much rewritten interference.</p>
<p>The classic material sounds simultaneously tougher and more reflective, less hyped-up but no less smartassed. <i>De La Soul Is Dead</i>'s<i> </i>leadoff cut “Oodles of O's” feels leaner and more tense over Dilla's sparse, deceptively simple minor-key bass-and-drums beat, while “Leave Your Cares Behind” is a sly, airy, neo-soulful parallel of the Chic-interpolating “A Roller Skating Jam Named 'Saturdays'” that switches its mood from low-lit free-skate session to sunny barbecue vibes, closing on a preposterous flip of the ""Spongebob Squarepants"" theme song.</p>
<p>After this year's minor debacle that was De La Soul's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53969-de-la-soul-offer-entire-catalogue-for-free-download/"">25-hour free-album giveaway</a>—filled with filesharing timeouts and the revelation that the downloads were sourced from an MP3 pirate blog—it's tempting to pick this package apart for flaws as well. You could gripe that Dilla's family name is misspelled “Yancy” in some of the promotional material, but that's the limit of skepticism this project deserves. Along with the album itself, there's a brief “audio letter” that pays necessary, sincere tribute (“Dilla didn't just produce for us, he was an inspiration, and often a kickstart to many De La albums”). A 39-minute 2006 documentary project <i>Still Shining</i>, largely assembled with footage made around and shortly after Dilla's funeral service, is included in better-than-YouTube quality and serves as an important time capsule where friends, family, and collaborators pay tribute and come to terms with where his legacy was headed. The only money-making enterprise involved with <i>Smell the D.A.I.S.Y. </i>is a web bookmark directing people to a PayPal link for a donation to De La's fundraising efforts towards that legacy.</p>
<p>As a record, <i>Smell the D.A.I.S.Y. </i>is a fine diversion—a brisk 29 minutes, none of which feels superfluous—and a good stopgap in a busy-looking 2014 for De La that promises a Pete Rock/Premier-produced EP and their first full-length in ten years. But as an effort to keep the spirit of a good friend and musical inspiration alive? That's where this is made to last.</p></div>"|19215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19215-de-la-soul-smell-the-daisy/|7.5|Nate Patrin

That was nearly twenty years ago, and if that makes <i>you</i> feel old, imagine how the Faint must’ve felt when they went on hiatus following 2008’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12073-fasciinatiion/"">Fasciination</a></i>. For sullen teens who thought <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3515-rage-against-the-machine/"">Rage Against the Machine</a> were for jocks, the Faint's angsty, political electro-punk could've seemed like the most exciting shit imaginable, and by the time they reunited to play festivals in 2012, everyone was free to admit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-NbXGjXT4Q&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Agenda Suicide”</a> kinda kicked ass. A new album wasn’t part of the deal, but if we’re going to get one anyway, at least the title of <i>Doom Abuse</i> shows their heads are in the right place. They’re not here for new recruits.</p>
<p>Of course, that means the Faint still have to make Faint-like music, and they can’t claim any new insight to our political and socioeconomic problems. Regardless if Todd Fink has opinions on the NSA and the Crimea, as far as he’s concerned, 2014 might as well be 2004—or 1994, or <i>1984</i>. During the anti-everything recitation of “Animal Needs”, Fink nasally intones, “We don’t need soap/ We don’t need straws/ We don’t need software to tell us we’re lost.” He also tells us we don’t need toilets, so...shots fired, <a href=""http://www.americanstandard-us.com/bathroom-products/toilets/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American Standard</a>?</p>
<p>The level of discourse on <i>Doom Abuse</i> will hit the spot for people who still think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1066-desaparecidos/"">Desaparecidos</a>’ political views are a little <i>too</i> nuanced. Who knows if Fink even believes half the shit he says, but his functional nihilism is an accessory not all that different than pleather pants or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47570-saddle-creek-to-reissue-the-faints-danse-macabre/"">Commie-chic album covers</a>: disaffection is sexy, so whether you’re batting your guyliner or rolling your eyes, it’s all part of the same outfit. As he sings at one point, “Evil voices lie when they say you’re in love!”, proving that even coupling is inextricable from shadow-government involvement.</p>
<p>To the Faint’s eternal credit, their sacrifice of any modicum of ""cool"" means the songs on <i>Doom Abuse</i> more fun-silly than flat-out dumb. It’s even more Faint-like than the exceedingly <i>sui generis Fasciination</i>, so at the least they can be forgiven for giving the people what they want. Even if they’re subject to fairly brazen ripoffs<b>—</b>there’s at least twenty different <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a> riffs that are similar to the one that drives “Mental Radio”, and the <i>XTRMNTR JR</i> industrial agit-prop of “Animal Needs” is pretty much a verbatim copy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream"">Primal Scream</a>'s “Swastika Eyes.”</p>
<p><i>Doom Abuse</i> is most enjoyable when its superficial slapstick is at its most pronounced, which is most of the time<b>—</b>it’s uptempo, it’s unashamedly hooky, Fink shouts a lot, and it’s over before you can take the time to pick apart study hall manifestos like “Unseen Hand” or “Dress Code”, a 100-second shoutdown against, uh, dress codes. <i>Doom Abuse</i> isn’t so much an argument for the Faint’s continued relevancy as it is for the potency of their real-time nostalgia.</p></div>"|19186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19186-the-faint-doom-abuse/|6.1|Ian Cohen

As low-intensity and mellow as it was, the warped instrumenation and crackling undercurrents of static and accelerated-aging decay seemed immediately tactile, doing for your ears what a look up into sunlight filtered through a canopy of leaves does for your eyes. After the fatigue of the most endless-seeming winter in ages, a followup feels sorely needed.</p>
<p>And yet it seems like something's been lost in the intervening years, considering how concise and relatively unadventurous <i>E S T A R A </i>has turned out to be. Unadventurous in this case doesn't necessarily mean derivative, least of all derivative of himself; the departure from the sprawling warmth of <i>Ardour </i>into more straightforward beats is at least transitional. And it's not necessarily boring, either—it's appealingly pretty music that's still a bit too attention-getting to recede into the background. But this is one of those cases where little manages to stick after repeated listens: slow builds, subtle shifts and clever juxtapositions reward close listening, but it doesn't do much to actually pull listeners in.</p>
<p>Meeting the music more than halfway isn't that strenuous, thankfully, and the early advance singles are enough to get a sense of the album's strong points. Jonti collaboration “Holiday” has the neat trick of smearing and smothering its notes to the point that there's little distinction between where the melodic progressions end and the sustained drones begin, thickly layered walls of percussive melody and melodic percussion concocting a blurry haze for bird chirps and sun-bleached vocals to stream through. “View Point” is more upfront in its structure—a beat that sounds like a muted, underwater tabla, offset with distorted ringing-bell chords that oscillate between sharp chimes and dissipating waves—and, with its parallel senses of deep rhythm and medidative drone, does a lot to advance Teebs' strengths as someone who can put together a dance track with the nuance and delicacy of an ambient composition.</p>
<p>There are other moments of arresting beauty, like the bossa-tinged beat on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a> collab “NY pt. 2” that pairs airy woodblock and heavy-elastic kicks with crystalline acoustic guitar notes, or the sustain-drenched keys that make “Piano Days”/”Piano Months” feel like Overlook Hotel muzak if the ghosts were more Miyazaki than Kubrick. But there are just as many songs that slip through your ears. “Shoouss Lullaby” is little more than windchimes over foot-dragging bass rumbles that eventually drag themselves out of bed to join a woozy-headed beat, and “SOTM” runs off the jittery momentum of a gathering-steam burble of rapidfire click-boom-cymbal percussion. But even at opposite ends of the energy-level spectrum, they're both too gauzy and vague to resonate much further than the last moment of fading reverb.</p>
<p><i>E S T A R A </i>is almost hypnotic in its tendency to make each individual track blur itself into an indistinct piece of a loosely memorable whole, one with little impression actually retained even if it jumps from mood to mood. Melancholy, bucolic relaxation, and agitated giddiness all run through this record, but its emotionally calming effect comes at the expense of anything truly revelatory or exciting. It's only when the clarinet of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2161-jaga-jazzist/"" target=""_blank"">Jaga Jazzist</a>'s Lars Horntveth wafts its way into an almost snarky song- and album-ending moment at the conclusion of “Wavxxes”. There the sustained momentum finally all winds down in a flurry of missed notes and stray chuckles— the humanity finally piercing the surface. The mood is broken, the past 40 minutes vanish into the ether, and the loose sense of having just experiencing something fairly pleasant is all that's really left. Still, that elusive moment's worth trying to recapture with each listen.</p></div>"|19152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19152-teebs-e-s-t-a-r-a/|6.7|Nate Patrin

Her last record, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13982-kairos/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kairos</i></a>, was woozy both instrumentally and conceptually, leaning toward gossamer dream pop. <i>Baby</i>, her newest, sheds the downtempo beats of <i>Kairos</i>, experimenting with more jagged percussion and orchestral flourishes, notably horns. Dienel learned Protools and built a studio in the basement of her parents’ house, and the methodical approach to the recording, arrangement and production yields a work that feels homegrown (Pitchfork contributor Matt LeMay mixed the record). But for all the sonic change-ups, her idiosyncratic voice remains the music’s signature.</p>
<p>Dienel is in a line of vocalists who subvert traditional diction—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/116-fiona-apple/"" target=""_blank"">Fiona Apple</a> with her asymmetrical couplets, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>’s ability to contort syllables. She tucks whelps and cries between verses, moving from opera-worthy falsettos to pained whimpers, at times recalling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a>’s blackened folk and even the indie pop falsetto crawl of Portugal. The Man frontman John Gourley. <i>Baby</i>’s opener, “Wait Until Dark,” features nearly a minute of tense near-silence, with Dienel spitting irregular verbs in the dark, creating an effect that’s uncomfortably intimate—not to mention riveting. “Show me respect, maybe then I’ll let you ride with me,” she growls and howls, curling the words behind the acid-keys of the record’s grooviest number, “Metronome.” Dienel can also belt with a diva’s range, especially on the Saturday night club-ready tracks such as “White Noise”. But the album also presents an interesting paradox: Dienel’s voice, the record’s most gripping element, can also be alienating. Occasionally, her ambitious approach lead in over-singing, such as on “Ring the Bell,” where her background vocals get in the way.</p>
<p>On the whole, <i>Baby</i> is an exceptionally cautious work and is, at times an uncomfortable listen; it’s an account of a woman wrestling with and tackling self-doubt and insecurity, exploring how it feels to lose control. “Is this my weakness?” Dienel asks as the instruments fade to black in the record’s title track. Over the song’s duration, the question evolves from an admission to a mantra, as Dienel’s voice gains traction and grows in power. Corrosive lyrics also make it an exceptionally <i>heavy</i> listen, when she delivers likes like, “Pushed your head under the water till all your breath gave out” on the title track. But even though it’s filled with stark admissions, <i>Baby</i> is ultimately an unflinchingly <i>hopeful</i> record that sees an already talented artist finding finding new ways to grow.</p></div>"|19177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19177-white-hinterland-baby/|7.2|Paula Mejia

But further up the Pacific Coast Highway, <a href=""https://twitter.com/SageTheGemini"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sage the Gemini</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"">Iamsu!</a> of the Bay area’s <a href=""http://hbkgang.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heartbreak Gang</a> collective have refined a sound that draws influence from frenetic dance-informed NorCal hyphy music and L.A. jerk music, with hints of the sleek “crunk&amp;B” of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12244-jazze-pha/"">Jazze Pha</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"">Ciara</a>. In 2014, both artists are at a peculiar stage of fame: Iamsu!’s found success playing wingman to other artists, and Sage is sitting on gold and platinum viral hits that the average listener might not be able to recognize as his.</p>
<p>Sage’s debut single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I-YY5p0uq8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Red Nose”</a> worked its way into the Billboard Hot 100 thanks to its association with the Bay area’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frPL1tYhChA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yiking</a> dance movement; its chorus likens the dance’s signature lateral twerking motion to that of a wet dog shaking its head dry, and the use of “Red Nose” as a soundtrack to scores of yiking-focused Vines and Youtube videos lent it chart traction. Follow-up single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8LUd51IuiA&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Gas Pedal”</a> further advanced Sage’s star, bowing out in the lower rungs of the Top 40 and moving over a million units in the process; third single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45oqLHBCO7U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“College Drop”</a> tried to wrangle “Red Nose” and “Gas Pedal”’s successes and achieved modest success on the hip-hop songs chart. Sage’s instructional dance floor drills are presently his livelihood, but he’s a smart kid who knows he can’t spend the remainder of his career telling women how and where to shake their asses. So his debut album <i>Remember Me</i> arrives with a mission: keep listeners on their feet, but show some range.</p>
<p><i>Remember Me</i> marks a respectable attempt at achieving that goal; its opening title track matches sped-up mobb-music sonics to autobiographical nerd-makes-good testimonials, and the rest of the album peppers a parade of carefree party music with pathos. A lot of the album is kiddie-pool deep and full of pith for jealous onlookers, pep talks for struggling rappers, boasts about girls wooed out from under lames, celebrations of new money, and a healthy shock of incredulity that any of this is happening. Closer “Second Hand Smoke” pushes its luck on a foggy anti-drug metaphor never quite comes together, but Sage’s affable aw-shucks charm and sparingly busy delivery draw attention off the goofiness of the premise. <i>Remember Me</i> is short on hard-fought insights and heavy on Sage and Su’s goofball wordplay and sharp hook construction, but it radiates the confident cool of studio rats perfectly at ease rhyming with friends over homemade beats.</p>
<p>Sage the Gemini’s greatest strengths are compositional. He produced six of <i>Remember Me</i>’s twelve songs, and those cuts showcase both a mercenary efficiency with post-hyphy club bangers and a questing desire to turn them inside out. Sage knocks out all the curt uptempo numbers early on “Bad Girls” and “Go Somewhere”, both built around martial drum patterns and brash synths that oscillate in and out of key. By the album’s midway point, all the strip club-friendly dance tutorials are spent as Sage comes with the change-up in “Put Me On”, a bit of clownish, spectral video game boss lair music with disorienting drum construction.</p>
<p><i>Remember Me</i>’s back half committedly illuminates the frayed edges of Sage’s sound: the brusque 808 infused trap excursion “Down on Your Luck” trades <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>-esque flow missives with singer <a href=""http://www.augustalsina.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">August Alsina</a>, “Mad at Me” pops collars over jazzy guitar and pulsing cymbals care of HBK associate <a href=""https://twitter.com/jayantmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jay Ant</a>, and “Don’t You” works wonders with a one-chord hook. “Second Hand Smoke” possesses a brittle lyrical conceit and is garbled in concept, but its ornately layered melodies make for an authoritative closer.</p>
<p>As an exercise in showcasing Sage the Gemini’s capabilities beyond booty music, <i>Remember Me</i> succeeds by keeping its sights reasonable and coasting past them on Sage’s garrulous charm and studio know-how. Periodically, he trips, and we end up with a dancefloor sargeant clunkily fishing out of his depth. But the writing here is always affable and occasionally gratifyingly personal, and barring a few cuts, the production is never less than engaging. Sage modulates from partied-out excess to spoils-of-newfound-fame reflection rather well, steering mercifully clear of lofty ideas and tough-guy posturing he’d look out of place assuming. <i>Remember Me</i> keeps its mood light and its stakes low, and in the process delivers a much needed breezy counterpoint to all the knotty, fatalistic shit coming out of HBK’s downstate peers that’s every bit as true to Cali as the gangsters and the thinkers.</p></div>"|19206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19206-sage-the-gemini-remember-me/|7.5|Craig Jenkins

These three distinct talents are, in a sense, insoluble, but their electro-focused sound works when their synapses fire off of each other and the ideas dovetail and blend together. Their first release, 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16418-sss-beak-claw/""><i>Beak &amp; Claw </i></a>EP, was a scattered lark that featured an abundance of Auto-Tune; on their self-titled debut LP, that element's been scrubbed from the group's formula, and the three of them have improved on their ability to create fractured-sounding music together—even if the results prove a little frustrating.</p>
<p>Inspired by Jim Hodges’ art installation <a href=""http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2012/slideshow-jim-hodges-minneapolis-boulders"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Untitled”</a>, as well as the artist's body of work, <i>Sisyphus </i>was co-commissioned by Minneapolis’ Walker Art Center and St. Paul Chamber Orchestra’s SPCO’s Liquid Music series. There's high-minded artistic ambitions at work here, then, as <i>Sisyphus </i>can be classified as something executed with the aim of being displayed and <a href=""http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2014/sisyphus-limited-edition-album-release"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sold in a museum</a>. To wit: the record's most simplistically fun moment is a six-and-a-half minute, multi-section song called “Calm It Down”, featuring positive-thinking musings from Serengeti and the type of balladry that Stevens executed so well on 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14738-the-age-of-adz"">Age of Adz</a>.</i>  Other engaging moments are located in the slow-building noise of album closer “Alcohol”, as well as the vocoder'd pomp of “Rhythm of Devotion”, which finds <span>‘Geti aping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>’s ""New Slaves"" cadence throughout</span>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the trio's cleverness can get the best of them. Serengeti occasionally values sticking to a rhyme scheme over telling a narrative (""Booty Call""), while Lott can't focus on honing one good idea (the shapeshifting ""Flying Ace""), and Stevens issues one too many utterances of the word “booty”. Then there's the untangleable mess of ""My Oh My"", which unwisely merges skittery trap synths, ill-fitting sitcom references (""<span>Drink a lot of milk like my name was Ted Cleaver""</span>), and Stevens' now-trademark flute runs on the song's chorus.</p>
<p>However, much of <i>Sisyphus</i> is bogged down in malaise. In an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53400-listen-sufjan-stevens-son-lux-and-serengeti-announce-lp-as-sisyphus-share-calm-it-down/"">interview</a> about the album, Stevens stated the group's artistic intent: “We wanted to make ear candy—catchy raps, pop songs, and sad ballads. But if you inspect some of the content, you’ll uncover some bleak events.” You don't have to dig deep, though, to find the bleakness: witness Stevens singing in his teary-eyed voice ""I'm prepared for death/ I will tear clothes” on the dirge-like ""I Won't Be Afraid."" On the sparse ""Dishes in the Sink"", Serengeti raps from the perspective of a blue-collar, acerbic character whose sardonic attitude is reflected in the rapper's delivery: ""<span>I was happy once when I went to a real brunch/ It was special.""</span> These dour elements are tied together by Son Lux’s production, whose classical-electro beats are so spiny and unsteady they inspire more squinting than head-nodding.</p>
<p>More often than not, <i>Sisyphus</i> misses its mark, but the album's dense, melancholy back half represents its strongest moments. On ""Lion's Share"", Serengeti tells a <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/01/08/kenneth_conley_prison_escape_breaking_down_one_of_the_greatest_prison_breaks.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ripped-from-the-headlines story</a> about a Chicago jail break in a straight-forward chilled out '80s throwback rap, while “Dishes in the Sink” and its companion ballad “Hardly Hanging On” tell a genuinely affecting story of squalor and depression. Despite these peaks, <i>Sisyphus</i> is more fun to ponder than it is to listen to.</p></div>"|19199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19199-sisyphus-sisyphus/|6.2|Jeremy D. Larson

The band, now based in Portland, Oregon after years spent in Providence, Rhode Island, take doom metal as their core template and shred it to pieces until it's completely unrecognizable. The band, a two-piece of drummer Lee Buford and guitarist/singer Chip King, plus longstanding studio collaborators Seth Manchester and Keith Souza, clearly felt something needed to change after their 2013 album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18630-the-body-christs-redeemers/""><i>Christs, Redeemers</i></a>. That album felt like a retreat, a surrender, a settling into type, where prior form and function was repeated, not forwarded. Enter Bobby Krlic, the British musician who records jaundiced electronic works under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"">Haxan Cloak</a> moniker, who comes on board as producer, helping Buford and King rip the guts out of their sound to achieve maximal brutality.</p>
<p>Something that's evolved over time with the Body's work is their use of space, not just in their choral collaborations on prior records, but also in their other material. On <i>I Shall Die Here</i> it's their most potent weapon, giving the sound a greater sense of suggestion than ever before. The dips into near-silence, where machine noise is allowed to trail quietly in the mix, effectively work as cues to pry open the imagination. At times they even function like a scene in a horror movie, where you just know something bad is coming around the corner, but the sense of anticipation is so expertly orchestrated that the fear is only heightened when the moment finally hits. ""Our Souls Were Clean"" is the best example of that here—it's all echoing electronics that resemble a machine repeating on itself long after any human hand has touched it, ultimately turning into a convulsing swirl of noise that feels like being trapped in a constant spray of vomit over the two-minute close of the song.</p>
<p>It's not always clear who did what here, or how much Krlic overhauled the sound of the Body. In a sense it's better going into <i>I Shall Die Here</i> without knowing whether samples changed hands, or how strips of guitar were pulled out and inserted elsewhere. A strong air of album-as-standoff results, with musicians from different disciplines throwing daggers into each other's work, making it feel like everyone was eyeing each other uneasily across the studio floor. Such working methods could turn into a mess, but here it results in a great weight of tension sinking into the material. It's hard not to feel suffocated by it all when the death march beat of ""To Carry the Seeds of Death Within Me"" pulls in layer upon layer of oppression. But there are also strong dynamics at work in ""Seeds"", especially when the song gets stripped down to the bare bones and a great sweep of noise jolts it back to life—a trick mirrored on the opening ""Consumed"" from Krlic’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17732-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2-excavation/""><i>Excavation</i></a>. It makes it feel like ten tons of electricity are suddenly pulsing through the track.</p>
<p>An unrelentingly bleak worldview is presented throughout the Body's work, and often in their interviews as well. Occasionally they substitute desolation for ghoulish thrills, which is marginally less successful. The pitch-shifted spoken word intro to ""Alone All the Way"" adds an unwelcome touch of schlocky horrorcore, although the subsequent track—all air raid distress calls and isolated screeches in the dark—brings the murky air of pessimism that curls up around the album firmly back into view. At its strongest, on the standout ""Hail to Thee, Everlasting Pain"", it's an album that takes a mazy journey through styles, not so much seeking common ground between them, but actively looking for the point of agitation that arises as they brashley bruise up against one another. So ""Hail"" takes in a great lattice of sound, bringing samples on board that resemble the compact structures of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>'s <i>Amber</i>, along with treated industrial drums, great slabs of drone-y guitar, and King's blood-curdling shriek.</p>
<p>The collective work on <i>I Shall Die Here</i> makes it feel like all involved were searching for illogical endpoints, driving strains of metal and electronic music to some kind of brink of extremes that the Body and the Haxan Cloak's individual output had never taken them before. There's certainly an end-of-all-things atmosphere, but perhaps more importantly a strong sense of unlearning everything they knew in an attempt to push music into a totally new space. Not that this is music without precedent; there are shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"">Prurient</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a> at various times. But the execution of <i>I Shall Die Here</i> is so full-blooded, so committed to forcing your head underwater to the point of blackout, that it's hard not to view this as a singular piece, out there on its own, in a place most people wouldn't want to go anywhere near. It adds a chillingly lonely air to the work, making it morbidly fascinating to see its participants head out on a road pointed eternally downward, landing in a place wracked by torment and lost hopes.</p></div>"|19180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19180-the-body-i-shall-die-here/|7.8|Nick Neyland

As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a>, Sean Canty and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31240-miles-whittaker/"">Miles Whittaker</a> have spent the last five years exploring techno's chillier, more obtuse corners, merging the library-music aesthetic of projects like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23573-bbc-radiophonic-workshop/"">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a> with the harsh, pounding dub of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel"">Basic Channel</a>. On his own, Whittaker's explored a slightly more streamlined take on dance music—albeit a take that's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15220-status-narcissism/"">prone to ear-blasting noise</a>—while psychic brethren and fellow Mancunian <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"">Andy Stott</a>'s made a name for himself with his slow, bog-dipped dub techno, most recently perfected on 2012's astounding, vocal-heavy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/""><i>Luxury Problems</i></a>.</p>
<p>The music coming out of this collective is often dark, ominous, and thrilling; that said, the abstractions the trio of artists work in are such that uninitiated listeners could ostensibly accuse this music of, well, not being much fun. That's where Stott and Whittaker's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32030-millie-andrea"">Millie &amp; Andrea</a> project comes in: back in 2008, the pair teamed up under their gender-bending aliases (Millie = Miles, Andrea = Andy) to release an impressive run of 12""s that, while staying true to their tunnel-beat outlook, were exploratory in nature, adding slinky basslines, bursts of melody, and aromatic vocal samples into their smoky cauldron. ""Too many people are really too serious about what they're doing,"" Whittaker told <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2014/03/28/millie-andrea-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FACT</a> late last month. ""And in the end a lot of music's just fun to make."" That mission statement was best exemplified on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16571-stage-2/"">""Stage 2""</a>, released at the top of this year and marking the first new music from the Millie &amp; Andrea name in four years; the overwhelming track's clipped vocal samples, dizzying run of tones, and deeply felt bass suggested that, in returning, the pair were looking towards the hedonistic sounds of trap music for inspiration.</p>
<p>It will be a relief to some and a disappointment to others, then, that <i>Drop the Vowels</i>, the project's debut LP, is <i>not</i> a trap record, despite what its trend-baiting title suggests. Whittaker and Stott are still exploring familiar territory—hollow dub techno, into-the-red noise, breakbeats that hiss and spit with static—but they're still fond of coloring outside of the lines as they did on 2009's ecstatic <a href=""s"">""Ever Since You Came Down""</a>. ""Stay Ugly"" feeds a colorful synth line through distortion, as a drum break cyclically contracts and expands in nastiness; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16721-millie-andrea-corrosive/"">""Corrosive""</a>, the album's most easily apprehensible cut, takes clicking footwork patterns and slathers them in fog, arpeggiated tones rippling endlessly in the distance before another chaotic break crashes through to disrupt the proceedings. For those familiar with Whittaker and Stott's individual output, the firmament backing these sounds are unmistakably their creators'—but the extra flourishes are what prove most surprising.</p>
<p>Amidst <i>Drop the Vowels</i>' pleasing left-turns—the clipped vocal sample that kicks open ""Spectral Source"", a track originally released in Millie &amp; Andrea's first run of 12""s, carries a sugared swing while also sounding like someone being slowly choked to death—Whittaker and Stott excel when zeroing in on texture. The layers of echo and frizzy static applied throughout are done to create a 3D effect—essentially, this is body music, in that the crashing noise feels so uncomfortably close-range that it can resemble someone scraping your eardrums with a knife. Whittaker and Stott possess a gentle side, too: the chaotic tumble of ""Temper Tantrum"" occasionally peels back to reveal a chipmunk'd vocal sample before emptying its cargo bay to reveal a lush backdrop of drone. Stick around until the track's very end, too, when Whittaker and Stott let loose a single, satisfying bass hit possessing a brown-sound subtlety.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Stott's <i>Luxury Problems</i> stood as the best entry point to his and Modern Love's harsh, uninviting world of razed sonics; while <i>Drop the Vowels</i> doesn't carry the game-changing nature of that album, the relative sonic variety it provides compared to <i>Luxury Problems</i>' expressively singular mindset makes for a solid introduction to one of contemporary techno's most consistently exciting collectives. When working together, Whittaker and Stott pull off an enviable trick of retaining specific stylistic tics they possess separately while creating something that sounds not quite like anything either of the artists have made before, and hopefully they won't wait so long to execute their collaborative talents again.</p></div>"|19147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19147-millie-andrea-drop-the-vowels/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Range of Light </i>is the first album Carey's recorded in Bon Iver bandmate Justin Vernon's April Base studio in Fall Creek, Wis.; he cobbled together his 2010 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14569-all-we-grow/""><i>All We Grow</i></a> while on tour with Bon Iver and built 2012's electro-folk <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16587-s-carey-hoyas-ep/""><i>Hoyas</i></a> EP on mostly just a laptop. The warmth, reverb, and dusty textures here form something much larger than S. Carey has ever done before, but his real talent lies in making these songs seem tiny set against the world around him.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even though Carey’s canvas is large, <i>Range of Light</i> is all detail—including his voice, which remains whisper-quiet and occasionally climbs to a hushed tenor akin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a>. His voice is more up front than before, which gives these songs more shape as he interacts with the ceaselessly beautiful soundscapes, breaking up the serenity with songcraft. The syncopated “Crown the Pines” uses Justin Vernon’s falsetto as another background texture, but the busyness of the whole thing serves as a perfect jolt for the record. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A trained percussionist in both jazz and classical music, Carey’s arrangements add a sense of rustic whimsy to <i>Range of Light</i>—there's tapping on glass bottles, spoons on thighs, and what sounds like someone walking over gravel. Carey achieves his greatest successes when working in a more transportative mode, though: the stately “Alpenglow” builds to the end like a thawing post-rock opus, and closing track “Neverending Fountain” provides a cathartic ending. It's easy for these songs to stir the listener, and even easier for them to to whisk the listener away to a secluded piece of earth. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Paradoxically, <i>Range of Light</i> can sound a little too on-the-nose about embodying the majesty of nature and its meditative properties; there are greyscale cuts that possess cautious wonder and tumble-dry jazz tones, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"">Talk Talk</a> left out in the cold for too long. Carey's destinations and recollections can retreat to a sleepy, melancholy safe zone. Regardless, <i>Range Of Light</i> is the first album that defines Carey apart from his bandmates and contemporaries, as his developed, earnest, Midwestern glow bursts through the album's cracks.    </span></p></div>"|19143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19143-s-carey-range-of-light/|7.3|Jeremy D.

Several years ago, the core members packed up and left their native Baltimore for Portland. Even before that move, they'd been experimenting with dynamics and genres, slowly outgrowing their crust punk roots. They're quite good at it: The quintet's possessed with the uncanny ability to swirl together crust, melodic death metal, black metal, metallic hardcore, doom, noise, and ambient music into a cohesive, engaging whole. Here, they join the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31195-agrimonia/"" target=""_blank"">Agrimonia</a>, Downfall of Gaia, Fall of Efrafa, and even their clear inspirations in Neurosis and Tragedy as examples of crust bands who reached for something more, and ended up with something greater. Their 2009 LP <i>Asleep in the Ashes</i> is still one of the best examples of cross-genre pollination in regards to extreme metal, and with their third full-length (and debut for Relapse), they’ve provided more firepower for the argument. Given the high quality of their past work, Nux Vomica have continued to refine their sound in truly impressive fashion, and on this self-titled, three-song opus, they’ve hit upon an ideal balance of beauty and brutality.</p>
<p>The presence of melody is more pronounced and well-developed, and the dark, heavy moments hit harder. Just Dave’s ragged vocal approach is pure crust punk fury, and undoubtedly the most straightforward aspect of the band’s sound. Nux Vomica are otherwise happy to play with genres and dynamics, cherrypicking buzzing, icy tremolo picking, and rising melodic chords (a shining example of which lies midway through “Sanity Is for the Passive”) and applying them to their foundation of crusty metallic hardcore. Slow-burning buildups and ecstatic melodic crescendos keep the album moving, and even a 20-minute track like “Choked at the Roots” refuses to drag. It’s an impressive feat, but Nux Vomica have been working towards this moment for more than a decade. Their alliance with Relapse marks what may very well be their “big break,” or at least, go a long way towards introducing them to the uninitiated. It’s good timing, because this is their best effort to date.</p>
<p>Opening track “Sanity Is for the Passive” rushes in with urgency, framed by Dave’s frantic barks that rail against the media’s culture of misinformation. “We cannot live this way, we must resist!,” he howls, frustration and desperate rage informing every syllable. Nux Vomica’s politicized bent has formed the bedrock of the band’s philosophy since its inception in 2003, and this latest effort sees them dial it up even further. On “Sanity Is for the Passive”, they place the onus to improve conditions on the oppressed, snarling “Why do we participate so willingly?” Here, drummer Zacrilege leans heavily on his toms to create a huge rolls of tribal-influenced, Neurosis-style thunder, and the song itself roils atop the skeleton of a Swedish melodic death metal riff and blasts of furious metallic hardcore. Over the course of nearly 13 minutes, that intensity dissolves into a turbid ambient dirge, punctuated only by nearly indecipherable guttural spoken-word samples and snippets of sharp political prose. “Reeling” follows prettily, climbing an almost shoegazy melodic riff to great heights and riding the positive energy for a good few minutes. That opening salvo parallels the gentle gloom of “Corpses With Egos” on their last full-length, adding a nice sense of continuity. Of course, being who they are, the song quickly shifts into eclectic territory, running Danny’s doomy, ultra-distorted bassline beneath strokes of dreamy post-rock before picking up the pace and punching in desperate vocals and crashing cymbals.</p>
<p>Closer “Choked at the Roots” takes its time, grooving through a moody buildup before exploding. The Swedish death metal influence is strongest in this tune; some sections are full-on Gothenburg melodeath, while others jib closer with dark d-beaten hardcore. But it always sounds like Nux Vomica. The guitar work on this track is spectacularly creative and never gets away from itself; whenever they seems close to veering off course, guitarists Tim Messing and Chris Control turn on a dime and dive into a new riff or idea. The mid-song interlude cycles back to a haunting feedback-driven instrumental and ends on a triumphant note of hardcore euphoria. For a band that concerns itself so deeply with society’s ills and the sins of man, this is an incredibly joyful record. Perhaps they can tell they’ve made a difference.</p></div>"|19163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19163-nux-vomica-nux-vomica/|8.0|Kim Kelly

As you listen to new work by Julianna Barwick or Jóhann Jóhannson, thank Richter; just as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a> did with its widescreen rock, Richter showed that crossover wasn’t necessarily an artistic curse. Nearly a dozen years later, the material finally got its due.</span></p>
<p>When Richter began composing what became <i>Memoryhouse</i> in the late 90s, he had no idea if any ensemble would ever record the work, let alone play it live: “I just wrote the work for my own peace of mind—to just get it out of my system,” <a href=""http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4147347-max-richter-discusses-revisiting-memoryhouse"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he recounted earlier this year.</a> “This was my first time recording my ‘real’ music with an orchestra... It seemed like a crazy thing to happen.” In many ways, this is simply the sound to which his three decades of life had directed him. He’d written music as early as a pre-teen, then fallen for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kratfwerk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles</a>. He’d considered becoming a poet by trade. Eventually, Richter rigorously studied music, training as a classical pianist and composer and working under the auspices of experimental innovator Luciano Berio. Richter went on to help form the minimalist-focused group Piano Circus and, during their popular mid-90s run, collaborated closely with the electronic duo the Future Sound of London. Funded by a short-lived record label wing of the <a href=""http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/bbcs-late-junction-starts-spin-off-label/032368"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wonderfully eclectic BBC3 show Late Junction</a>, <i>Memoryhouse</i> arrived as the post-modern nexus of it all—the piano and the strings, the bass and the static, the poems and the samples, set against <a href=""http://patrickpittman.com/2012/08/an-interview-with-max-richter/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a rather solemn view of worldwide political struggle.</a></p>
<p>A few relatively straightforward pieces for strings and sometimes horns help anchor <i>Memoryhouse.</i> For instance, “Last Days” works as a symphonic crescendo, with incisive strings providing the tension against a march of low brass and concert percussion. The piano sonata “Andras” presses into an unseen ceiling, a melody growing only so loud and busy before quieting down again and again. But much of <i>Memoryhouse</i> threads those standard maneuvers against risky production choices and rather unexpected textures. “Garden (1973)/Interior” builds a glorious drone behind the voice of John Cage reading his poems; eventually, the long tone yields to a sobbing violin line that winds through a harpsichord lace. And during the brazen “Untitled (Figures)"", Richter accents a beat that might’ve been lifted from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a> with twinkling bells and sighing strings. “Laika’s Journey” takes the sonic structure of an orchestra and inverts it, string-based splendor becoming the basis of notes that fade in and out like ghostlights.</p>
<p>Some of the gambles are subtler. Above field recordings and a reading from political refugee and poet Edmond Jabès, opener “Europe, After the Rain” plays a disappearing game with its piano and string sections. Each separate element sometimes sounds as though it were being transmitted through a radio or piped in from the next room. Richter is undermining the orchestra he never thought he’d have. “Landscape with Figure (1922)” initially moves with the drama and grace of Arvo Pärt’s <i>Tabula Rasa</i>, but Richter fights the impulse to stay polite. By piece’s end, the (acoustic) bass seems swollen enough to accompany<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank""> Sunn O)))</a>, the higher notes piercing and loud enough to galvanize most any post-rock climax. But it's the remarkable “Lines on a Page (One Hundred) Violins” that does it all: Richter crafts a wonderful moment of chamber ensemble beauty, then pits it against a background noise of spoken word signals and the kind of blissful electroacoustic haze Fennesz helped make famous. The track only lasts 83 seconds, but it’s a revelation of the possibilities that Richter would continue to explore on the more restrained and more thoroughly realized follow-up, 2004’s <i>The Blue Notebooks</i>. <i>Memoryhouse</i> was an essential starting point, not the peak of Richter’s aesthetic. That was yet to come.</p>
<p>Richter often talks about art as a sort of personal synthesis, where all the inspirations, influences and experiences of his life funnel into a particular project. That’s especially true for <i>Memoryhouse</i>, an album that took only two years to write but took most of his life to ponder. And the composer, now 46, first fell in love with recorded music not through shiny discs or tiny files but through slabs of vinyl. “Our sense of what is beautiful in music is always shaped by what we listened to as a kid, and when I think of great music, I think of vinyl music,” <a href=""http://sinfinimusic.com/uk/features/series/paul-morley/interview-with-max-richter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he said in an interview not long before the Barbican performance.</a> “The Beatles, the Beach Boys—they are an anchor to how I think, and they were made on tape, for vinyl.”</p>
<p>Apart from mere coronation of that January show, Richter’s preference is perhaps the best explanation for this latest reissue of <i>Memoryhouse</i>. Fat Cat imprint 130701 offered the album on both CD and LP when it initially re-released <i>Memoryhouse </i>in 2009, but this version puts the content on two white LPs, with a gatefold cover and additional art. If that sounds like a slim update of such an important album on such an auspicious date, it is. Richter tends to discuss music as a conversation between composer, subject and audience, but this feels a little like a monologue. Perhaps a set of essays that gets to the heart of why <i>Memoryhouse</i> mattered then <i>and</i> now, or even a batch of the musical sketches that led to these meticulous 65 minutes, could provide that sort of communicative context. Richter, after all, has never been shy about what this set meant to his career or for the subsequent rise of a particular “indie classical” cadre with which he’s often associated.</p>
<p>Still, hearing <i>Memoryhouse </i>again through any avenue for the first time in years provides a jolting reminder of just how much classical music has broken outside of its shell and into other realms during the last decade. Lost in the Trees, a band writing Baroque-influence song cycles about childhood trauma, can thrive on the rock label ANTI- alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Waits</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case/"" target=""_blank"">Neko Case</a>. Rock musicians like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27735-bryce-dessner/"" target=""_blank"">Bryce Dessner</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1819-jonny-greenwood/"" target=""_blank"">Jonny Greenwood</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4779-glenn-kotche/"" target=""_blank"">Glenn Kotche</a> can get legitimate attention and substantive interpretations of their classical sidelines with groups like So Percussion, yMusic and Kronos Quartet. The Ecstatic Music Festival can thrive to the point it reaches Carnegie Hall and launches marquee premieres of major works. And in London, Max Richter can hear <i>Memoryhouse</i> live for the first time, played by the orchestra that recorded it, in a very sold-out Barbican. </p></div>"|18864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18864-max-richter-memoryhouse/|8.7|Grayson Haver Currin

Matthew Cooper, the producer behind the multifaceted ambient project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1334-eluvium/"" target=""_blank"">Eluvium</a>, shares a label and a sensibility with post-rock juggernaut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"" target=""_blank"">Explosions in the Sky</a>—both craft towering edifices of sound that aren’t afraid to go for the emotional jugular. Inventions, a new project by Cooper and EITS guitarist Mark T. Smith, sounds much like you might expect, with a mix of Smith’s shimmering guitars and Cooper’s placid drones. But the familiarity works in the record’s favor—by laying aside the idea of making music outside of their comfort zones, they’re able to concentrate on craftsmanship, getting all the elements in the right place to evoke a specific set of feelings.</p>
<p>About those feelings: early in their career, Explosions in the Sky could have been just another band in the crowded field of post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a> instrumental rock. On a quick spin in 2001, you wouldn’t necessarily have guessed that in a decade they would be roughly 1,000 times bigger than, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2816-mono/"" target=""_blank"">Mono</a>. But if you listened more closely, it was clear that EITS had zeroed in on a small handful of emotions and mastered the means to evoke them. Anticipation, yearning, hope, and catharsis: this is more or less the totality of the band’s mental universe. Even their loudest and most crushing climaxes are imbued with hope. Rather than dissolving your ego, the way the most intense noise-saturated shoegaze can, Explosions in the Sky bolster it and put it front and center. Their guitar tones somehow suggest that you’ll find your place in the world, and then the build and the crescendo to make it so. It’s music about triumph, and they have it down to a science, which has the interesting effect of turning the whole thing into something resembling a physical exercise, like working a muscle. It may not be a particularly deep or complicated experience, but it is a powerful one, and also quite relatable. And this slice of feeling, which EITS have down completely, turned out to be perfect for soundtracking dramatic film and television of a certain stripe, where their music isn’t used as contrast or shading, but as an intensifier.</p>
<p>I’m focusing on Explosions in the Sky because <i>Inventions</i> ultimately seems closer to their aesthetic. Eluvium is harder to pin down, anyway, because Cooper has released everything from light piano instrumentals to thick drones that verge on noise; his music has never been just one thing. But here he’s working with Smith to make something that plays like low key EITS, capturing the flickering, starry-eyed parts before they grow. You can hear the thread in the light beats, chiming guitar, trails of feedback, and major chord synths drones running through the opening triptych of “Echo Tropism”, “Flood Poems”, and “Entity”.</p>
<p>There are also some new wrinkles. “Entity” has what sound like gurgling voices echoing in the distance, and the atmosphere is watery, amniotic, evoking early 90s ambient in the vein of the Orb. Relative to what surrounds it, it’s a detached and comparatively static track that keeps the focus on texture. “Peaceable Child” has a flittering strobe effect slicing the drone into tiny pieces, bringing to mind circa–2001 glitch, with dubby accents to match; it’s one of the few places where you hear the music and think, “computer,” but the change-up is welcome. Lack of variety aside, Eluvium and Smith couldn’t be a better match, and the record as a whole possesses an uncommon beauty.</p>
<p>Two tracks on <i>Inventions</i> outline both the power and the limitations of the project. “Sun Locations / Sun Coda” has a kind of queasy clatter going on in the middle of it, so it <i>almost</i> feels frightening but then never quite does, while the closing “Psychic Automation” shows how even when the music gets “heavy” with a massive beat in its final half it never shades to “dark.” The immaculate construction of both is undeniable and the tracks bring with them a rush of feelings, but there’s no escaping that at their core they still touch on that small handful of sensations that usually circle back around to yearning and wonder. But that’s not a bad thing. There are times when you know exactly where you want to go and this is the music to take you there.</p></div>"|19175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19175-inventions-inventions/|7.5|Mark Richardson

This is part of the fun of Wolfers' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29894-legowelt/"">Legowelt</a> alias: he's the rare producer whose personal mythology enriches his music instead of distracts from it (see also: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27648-omar-s/"">Omar S</a>). <i>Crystal Cult 2080</i> is Wolfers' latest album, and it's a lot like his last album, 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17483-the-paranormal-soul/""><i>Paranormal Soul</i></a>, as well as the dozen or so singles and EPs he released in the interim: richly melodic, forested techno and house erected with vintage gear both fetishized and pulled from the scrap heap.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Crystal Cult 2080</i> takes its title from Roland's somewhat obscure <a href=""http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/jv2080.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JV-2080 synthesizer</a> and, more interestingly, a ""germanium crystal compressor"" of Wolfers' own making. <i>Crystal Cult 2080</i>'s particular blend of swampy synth pads and shaman-y samples lends the album a rave-y feel, as if all the hokum of early-90s techno-gypsies like Spiral Tribe has been distilled so that you can experience a crusty field rave while browsing Twitter. Indeed, Wolfers seems to be injecting his persona into his music more so than on past albums. On <i>Crystal Cult</i>'s best tracks—""Excalibur <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab1NxOzzeUE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R8MK2</a>"", ""Psychotic Endurance"", ""Cyberspace Is Still Happenin' for Real""—his fake occultism seeps in. When, on ""Excalibur"", he turns a manic's chant (presumably sampled from the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082348/quotes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1981 flick</a>) into a mantra—""Drink from the chalice / And you will be reborn!""—he finds an earworm worthy of his fantastic, mystical bullshit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Legowelt is unique amongst house producers in that he invariably cares more about melody than rhythm. Most of his tracks feature a bog-standard 4/4 beat, with all of the sternum-popping compressed kicks and ticklish hi-hats we've come to expect. It's a very Detroit way of constructing tracks, and Wolfers owes plenty to early techno stalwarts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28606-anthony-shakir/"">Anthony Shakir</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24096-derrick-may/"">Derrick May</a>. Wolfers' melodies are luxe and abundant, and he stretches them over his simple rhythms with the fastidiousness of someone cinching sheets over a made bed. Wolfers definitely makes dance music, employing all of the proper idioms and tempos and textures necessary for inclusion in that sphere, but the balance of melody and rhythm in his work—especially on his albums—can make it seem like he merely chose the most socially acceptable forum in which to generate spaceship noises. Which is great: a man this adept at spaceship noises should not be stifled.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Wolfers' greatest talent is the ability to conjure a bunch of distinctly early-'90s feelings—barely disguised cheese, plasticine futurism—without peddling nostalgia. His music has plenty of antecedents, but Wolfers is just, like, in it for the tunes, man. ""I am just recording tracks all the time,"" <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=21507"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he says</a>. <i>Crystal Cult 2080</i> offers 10 more of them, replete with all of this frills we've come to expect from Wolfers. <i>Crystal Cult 2080</i> isn't weirder than Wolfers' previous albums; it's just better at being weird.</p></div>"|19172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19172-legowelt-crystal-cult-2080/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

Though their individual styles are different, both of them decompress lacy, yearning melodies into slow oceans of melancholy, and on 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16293-orcas/"">self-titled debut</a> as Orcas, their styles combined naturally, with small acoustic guitar songs drowned in gritty quasi-choral harmony.</p>
<p>Their second album, <i>Yearling</i>, retains the debut's vast scale, glacial pace, and visual splendor; the distortion of ""Petrichor"" dramatically unveils the kind of sweet motif, clasped in drones, that anchors the album. But Orcas fill in their abysses more fully than before, bringing the human presence closer to the surface. Contributions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1412-efterklang/"">Efterklang</a>'s Martyn Heyne and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27725-telekinesis/"">Telekinesis</a>' Michael Lerner on drums bring prior inklings of shoegaze, post-rock, and analog garage pop to the foreground, adding instrumental definition to previously nebulous masses of mood and tone. On ""Infinite Stillness"" and ""Half Light"", electric and acoustic guitars ride over the gray swirls of atmosphere rather than vanishing into them.</p>
<p>Where <i>Orcas</i> was mostly spun out from guitar and vocal improvisations, <i>Yearling</i> is said to be more specifically composed, and it certainly sounds that way. Despite a pleasing graininess, the songs are more crisply structured, with the terse, arid groove of ""An Absolute"" smoothly hinging on controlled cymbal crashes. Meluch's voice is sometimes drawn out in somnolent lines and sounding downright bouncy elsewhere; it's striking how peppy and soulful he sounds, far from his typical distant, affectless moan. Though he slips in and out of focus, there are several songs where he's undeniably <i>there—</i>a specific person singing with feeling, not a disembodied ghost moaning over some tundra.</p>
<p>""Filament"" recalls the vaguer portions of Orcas' debut, with Meluch's monastic intonations fading away in a martial beat and porous streaks of harmony. His vitality is missed on more heavily instrumental tracks, like the implacably shuffling ""Selah"" and the tape loop hymn ""Tell""; in fact, it's rather surprising that the most murky, atmospheric moments are <i>Yearling</i>'s weakest spots, as atmospheric murk is what they used to do best. The song craft and performance is more compelling when the ambient dressing is there to make the pop <i>pop</i>, rather than hiding it.</p></div>"|19171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19171-orcas-yearling/|7.0|Brian Howe

The band’s new record, the cheekily titled <i>NOW + 4EVA</i>, finds them continuing to embrace simple, radio-friendly sounds, with one foot newly planted in the realm of contemporary synth-pop songwriting.</p>
<p>It’s to the band’s credit that their gradual shift towards a mainstream pop tradition feels devoid of cynicism or condescension, qualities that tend to loom over indie bands making a push for commercial glory. In fact,<i> NOW + 4EVA</i> rings with a genuine enthusiasm for pop music, something that should be recognized and appreciated. Unfortunately, the group’s reverence for the form doesn’t directly translate into successful or memorable songwriting; instead, their tepid compositions invite listeners to seek out contemporaries and sonic ancestors with superior material.</p>
<p>The problem’s neatly encapsulated by the band’s cover of Jackie DeShannon’s 1963 standard <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVCBSIn_1j0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“When You Walk in the Room”</a>, a song that’s been tackled by everyone from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWQCLqab4o&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merseybeat bit players</a> to ABBA alumni. Architecture in Helsinki’s admiration for the song is seemingly sincere—in a <a href=""http://www.moshtix.com.au/v2/news/musicnews/architecture-in-helsinki-talk-now-4eva-and-edible-band-members/26712"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a> with Australian music site Moshtix, vocalist Cameron Bird mentioned their love for the original recording and its presence as a staple of their live shows—but their version is missing the subliminal sexual charge that renders the original so indelible. DeShannon makes it clear with the intensity of her delivery that this is an adult fantasy, one that’s dominating her brain and making it hard for her to focus on anything else; in the hands of Kellie Sutherland, the song’s stripped of that latent energy, and her take isn’t helped by an arrangement that’s saccharine to the point of cavity creation.</p>
<p>That slip-up aside, <i>NOW + 4EVA</i>’s finest moments coincide with Sutherland’s turns at the forefront: she has an airy, light vocal tone that’s reminiscent of compatriot Kylie Minogue, and helps shimmering pop-disco tracks like the funky “I Might Survive” and “2 Time” to achieve an easy, frictionless glide. Bird is less successful, struggling to sell a handful of goopy ballads (“Born to Convince You”, “April”) scattered throughout the album’s back half; ultimately, the weight of the failure falls on the group’s songwriting, rather than his takes on the material.</p>
<p>Looking at this album in the context of Architecture in Helsinki’s discography sheds light on a hidden strength of the band’s earlier hyperactive approach to composition: by jamming several discrete ideas into standard-length songs and moving between them with abandon, the group made it harder to isolate weak passages, and ensured the strongest bits rose to the front of listeners’ minds. The band has sharpened their focus on their most recent records, but in doing so has placed a spotlight on their songwriting and performance. It’s a shame that <i>NOW + 4EVA</i> can’t withstand this greater level of scrutiny.</p></div>"|19178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19178-architecture-in-helsinki-now-4eva/|5.2|Jamieson Cox

It’s probably the Brooklyn-via-Montreal singer and songwriter’s best-known tune—a laid-back guitar-pop daydream, as wobbly and welcoming as a backyard hammock—and it captures a lot of his music’s appeal. “Viceroy” is about taking pleasure in something that could kill you, and the lethal paradox is part of the draw. Somewhere in retirement, Joe Camel must be kicking himself. </p>
<p>This alluring ambivalence is one of DeMarco’s defining traits. He’s the gap-toothed prankster who sings the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51008-watch-mac-demarco-perform-still-together-for-yours-truly/"">sighing love ballad</a>. He’s the guy everybody assumes is a stoner, though he claims he never, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9J66MRSCW0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as they say</a>, touches the stuff. You can’t read about him without seeing the word “slacker,” but in two short years, he’s gone from opening at New York’s 550-capacity Bowery Ballroom to headlining at the 1,500-capacity Webster Hall (could he have done better if he’d tried?). The fact DeMarco isn’t even his real name—he was born Vernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV—captures the duality almost too perfectly. </p>
<p>Whichever Mac is the better-behaved one has been taking over more and more, as the creepy detours of 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16476-rock-and-roll-night-club/""><i>Rock and Roll Night Club</i> EP</a> gave way to the more direct <i>2</i>. His second full-length, <i>Salad Days</i>, isn’t a departure from its predecessor so much as a richer, increasingly assured refinement. For all its internal contradictions, <i>Salad Days</i> is no more or less than a great album in a tradition of no-big-deal great albums.</p>
<p>There’s little here to justify DeMarco’s reputation for divisiveness (“Detractors,” as Steven Hyden put it for <a href=""http://www.wonderingsound.com/review/mac-demarco-salad-days/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wondering Sound</a>, “tend to regard him as some kind of bullshit artist, a quintessential hipster doofus slumming it under the ironic guise of a hippie dirtbag who gleefully covers Limp Bizkit in concert”). The loping “Blue Boy”, which shares its title with an indie-pop classic by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz9Uqk55Jo&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Orange Juice</a>, amiably advises against acting so tough and worrying so much about your haircut. The warm, watery groove of “Brother” recalls the Beatles’ “Don’t Let Me Down”, though its moony lyrical sentiment (“You’re no better off living your life than dreaming at night”) might be more “I’m Only Sleeping”. You’re unlikely to hear a supposedly hip album this year with so many mentions of people’s mothers.</p>
<p>As with Real Estate’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19060-real-estate-atlas/""><i>Atlas</i></a>, DeMarco’s new album is also ostensibly one where the chill bro gets all mature and stuff, and here his inner conflicts return with a suitably nonchalant vengeance. The title track undercuts its narrator’s worries about aging by alluding to the inconvenient truth that the worrier is only 23—not exactly ready for that condo in Florida. Relatedly, anyone hoping for a pot anthem in organ-thick “Passing Out the Pieces” will instead find a koan-like complaint about the artist life’s crummy trade-offs. Penultimate “Go Easy” suggests concern for the girlfriend left behind while on tour, but its lyrical non sequitur—“You built it up, just to knock it down”—is a common criticism of the music press that has received DeMarco so favorably and could speak to his uneasy relationship with success. <i>Et tu</i>, Vernor?</p>
<p>It’s telling that <i>Salad Days</i>' most immediate song, the one with biggest chance of transcending DeMarco’s cult, is one he says he didn’t want to do. “Let Her Go” was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/mac-demarco/"">apparently</a> the answer to label Captured Tracks’ demands for “an upbeat single” suitable for late-night TV, and DeMarco is still upset about it. He shouldn’t be: It’s an outstanding crystallization of his gifts, the real-talk advice of Jonathan Richman with a far more accessible poetic dreaminess. Of course, even this reversal of the hoary “if you love her, let her go” chestnut undermines its own advice—“Or you can keep her, it’s OK, it’s up to you,” DeMarco counters in a speak-singing outro. It’s only fitting that stick-with-the-girl songs “Let My Baby Stay” and “Treat Her Better” are almost as tunefully plush.</p>
<p>In this context, DeMarco’s non-album antics start to look like another defense mechanism, another way of cutting himself off at the legs before someone else does it for him. That Limp Bizkit rendition showed up as part of a jokey 2013 live release; DeMarco has been vocal about how tiresome that novelty-cover setlist (Metallica, the Police, blah blah blah) became. And he previewed <i>Salad Days</i> with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIA1h9AwtfY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for a puckish perv-pop outtake centering on a refrain of “give me pussy.” So while his slack-not-slack aesthetic may point toward rising peers like Australia’s Courtney Barnett, there’s also ample reason Odd Future lightning rod Tyler, the Creator, who <a href=""https://twitter.com/fucktyler/status/448156977349140480"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cited</a> this album’s synth-dripping “Chamber of Reflections” as DeMarco’s best song, is a fan.</p>
<p>""Chamber of Reflections"" is something like Beach House's “Heart of Chambers”, but evoking a bare, cell-like apartment rather than a misty opium-den boudoir. It’s DeMarco’s most atmospherically exploratory track yet, and it’s also painfully lonely and quietly eloquent about the experience. So when, at the end of <i>Salad Days</i>' airy instrumental finale, “Jonny’s Odyssey”, he remarks, “Thanks for joining me, see you again soon, buh-bye,” you don’t wonder if you’re missing some April Fool’s joke. You want to offer the guy a light, and then you realize he already has plenty.</p></div>"|19170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19170-mac-demarco-salad-days/|8.5|Marc Hogan

A chiming electric guitar chord, as well as some actual chimes, make for a half minute of aural sage-burning to introduce the opening track “Starlight”. From there, the album is an intricate but not overwrought construction of clean, twinkly tones that distills George Harrison’s <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, the more gently decadent moments of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a> catalogue, and other high points of rock’s early-70s post-hippie chill-out phase. All along, <i>Angel</i> just sort of cruises on with tempos pegged to double-digit BPMs and the mood locked on “as mellow as humanly possible.”</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it’s a <i>boring</i> record, though—it has a healthy pulse, even if it never really climbs above an exceptionally relaxed state. There’s a lot of emphasis on mood and texture, but they never get in the way of the songwriting, which is consistent and generous with its hooks. The album’s surprisingly broad spectrum of influences seem to include a decent amount of Big Star—the melody lines on songs like “Valley of Tears” and “Every Tomorrow” have some of the zero-gravity quality of some of Chilton and Bell’s more pop-perfect moments. (And if the more brooding, swoony “Livin’ the Dream” is any indication, Big Star acolyte <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a>’s probably well represented too.)</p>
<p><i>Angel</i>’s promotional material emphasizes the fact that the album was written and recorded in a hundred-year-old dance hall in a remote corner of central Texas over the span of just five days, but that aspect of its creation doesn’t come through in the recording in an obvious way. A modern studio offers musicians interested in texture and atmosphere a more or less limitless range of options, but Pure X wisely keep things simple here. Beyond layering gentle acoustic guitars, ethereal multi-part vocals, and the occasional subtle flourish of analog synthesizer, they stick to a basic four-piece rock setup; the songs never fall victim to their own ambition and the music remains appealingly and accessibly human-scaled.</p>
<p>Pure X draw heavily from the past—not only Harrison, Bolan, Chilton, and Bell, but from the troves of vintage private press psychedelic folk records that in recent years have been uncovered and rescued from terminal obscurity. Their forbears offered a personal, pastoral cosmic transcendence that made sense in its own time, when Summer of Love naiveté was eroding into Nixon-era cynicism. <i>Angel</i> serves as a balm in another era defined by mass pessimism and doubt. It’s easy to criticize it for its escapism and refusal to grapple with a reality that extends outside the listener’s personal space. But on “Heaven”, when vocalist Nate Grace promises that, “heaven is a feeling,” it sounds believable, an offer to find shelter and peace in Pure X’s blissed-out cloud that’s almost too appealing to pass up.</p></div>"|19174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19174-pure-x-angel/|7.4|Miles Raymer

Luke Wyatt, the Brooklyn-based Virginia transplant who is the man behind the name, puts an astonishing amount of music out into the world, some of it beat-oriented, some of it edging close to the VHS nostalgia feel of chillwave. <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L.I.E.S.</a>, <a href=""http://www.rushhour.nl/label.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rush Hour</a>, and now <a href=""http://www.notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a> are among the many labels to have released his work. Film plays an important part in Wyatt's world—a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9346-torn-hawk/"">Rising</a> feature noted how his stepmother operated a movie theater, his music is often complemented by a mish-mash of grainy YouTube clips heavy on collage, and his song titles frequently reference the silver screen (<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s/torn-hawk-born-to-win-life"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Born to Win (Life After Ghostbusters)""</a>, ""Damage with Jeremy Irons"").</p>
<p>Wyatt calls his experiments in the visual realm ""video mulching,"" most of which consist of a barrage of imagery of an 80s hue. Those clips fall somewhere between the late-night disorientation of John C. Reilly's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_It_Out!_with_Dr._Steve_Brule"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Brule</a> character and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30721-daniel-lopatin/"">Daniel Lopatin</a>'s experiments with sound and vision under his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/sunsetcorp/videos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SunsetCorp</a> moniker. Lopatin took tiny loops of 80s music and set them to fuzzed-out visuals, drawing on two fascinations he undoubtedly shares with the Torn Hawk project. Dire Straits, Don Henley, and Christopher Cross have all been sampled by Wyatt, and his off-the-wall work includes <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/lukewyatt/sundayscdskipping"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sundays CD, Skipping""</a> (based around a glitched CD by indie pop icons <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3981-the-sundays/"">the Sundays</a>) and a track titled <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/emotional-response/the-music-you-hear-at-sea"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Music You Hear at Sea World and Never Forget""</a>.</p>
<p>The humor has been dialed down a notch on <i>Through Force of Will</i>, the latest Torn Hawk transmission, although the feeling of looking back to utopian visions of the past is firmly intact. What sets this apart from most chillwave is the strong sweep of romantic feeling that flows through Wyatt's mesh of guitar and electronics—there's palpable emotion here amid the tinny drum machines and twists of industrial synth. It doesn't all come out that way, especially when ""Streets on Fire"" begins with a hollowed-out drum sound that could have been ripped from a peak <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Jam_and_Terry_Lewis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jam &amp; Lewis</a> production. But Wyatt frequently uses his guitar tone, aligned somewhere between the dreamy strum of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"">Mark McGuire</a> and the type of squelchy soloing found on longer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a> tracks, to give his music a vital sense of yearn.</p>
<p>Torn Hawk's emotional impact is offset by the visual package, which is all rugged photos of Wyatt, who looks more stud-like than his tender playing might suggest, especially when he's deep into the intricate picking on a track like ""To Overthrow"". But <i>Through Force of Will</i> partly works because of its intentional signal jamming, where things don't lead where you expect them to on first glance, with Wyatt guiding his audience through the drone-y ambiance of ""Hutchison"" and ending up in the altered-states pop of ""Blindsided"". The VHS aesthetics may have a touch of over-familiarity about them, but there's just enough in Wyatt’s beefcake poses to suggest another twist being wrung out of the template, giving his persona the air of an alien outsider invited to the drugs party.</p>
<p>It's in the parameters Wyatt throws around this project that he breaks away from the vagaries of chillwave, substituting ambiguity with personality. Or, as he put it himself in an <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/torn-hawk-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>: ""I'm not going to restrict my impulses and make stuff in an anonymous fashion with some sort of minimal cover and numbered track titles."" The only counterpoint to that is in the sheer weight of material being released, which can make it hard to get a handle on who he is and where he's going. There's already a <a href=""http://www.rushhour.nl/store_detailed.php?item=75100"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">follow-up</a> to this record due imminently, and doubtless more will surface. But Wyatt clearly delights in setting things up in contrast to one another, particularly when polar opposites are involved, which gives him an incredibly broad field in which to play around. Somehow he's able to retain a sense of self even when looping his material over the blandest strains of 80s rock, and that's where he really succeeds, in defining a pallett that's recognizably his that concurrently allows him to go wandering in boundless directions.</p></div>"|19195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19195-luke-wyatt-through-force-of-will/|7.5|Nick Neyland

This is the sort of thing that used to be called “alternative rock” out of habit, and in 2014, it’s actually earned that name.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And yet, <i>Cope</i> once again finds Manchester Orchestra in the netherworld they’ve long occupied: not quite as cerebral as they aspire to be, nowhere near as lunkheaded as they could allow themselves to be, making radio-friendly rock too leaden and static to make reciprocity a foregone conclusion. That’s a shame, since Hull’s clearly an ambitious guy, demonstrated by his leave-it-all-on-the-floor live performances—but the ever-escalating arms race with himself resulted in the simultaneous crescendo and crash of 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15453-simple-math/"">Simple Math</a></i>, where Manchester Orchestra took the latter part of their name to heart and burdened their sturdy, workmanlike rock with Michael Kamen-level bombast.</p>
<p><i>Cope</i> doesn’t frame <i>Simple Math</i> as a misstep-in-hindsight, although it doesn't try to top it, either; this time around, it's 11 bullshit-free rock songs about getting past the bullshit in your life. Essentially, this is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/632-band-of-horses/"">Band of Horses</a> at their major-label crossroads and choosing not to hightail it into the heart of Dixie, alternating between pedal-to-the-floor howlers and bluesy bluster with little else in between. For fans of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10757-cease-to-begin"">Cease to Begin</a></i>, the potential that comparison carries is pretty awesome, except Manchester Orchestra lack any of the aforementioned’s sweep and expanse.</p>
<p>Even if <i>Cope</i> never manages the undeniable wallop of Manchester Orchestra's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJt1rdFZXlY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>S&amp;M</i></a>-friendly <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKgSs0MQ270"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Virgin”</a>, it’s still every bit as exhausting and overproduced. The strings are gone, but there’s not a single yielding surface on any of these songs, and the only respite you get from the roaring, textureless guitars is a palm-muted guitar. Even the high, lonesome harmonies, clearly meant to imbue some kind of human element, sound like digital clipping. Hull also fails to muster warmth and empathy, and despite his promise of <i>Cope</i> being “unrelenting and unapologetic”, he mostly flips <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INHVcFFt-a0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“one good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain”</a><i>: </i>these are loud songs that strike with the blunt force of a Nerf bat, as Hull emotes his heart out without really copping to anything. His lyrics have become tougher to parse, filled with parable and metaphor about relapse, religion and redemption, which makes the lost-soul clichés stick out even more than they previously did.</p>
<p>Look, if you’re anything like me and strive to find at least five real-deal alt-rock bangers per calendar year, it’s easy to pull for these guys<i>—</i>they are underdogs within an extremely unique context. Because this stuff can be potent in three-minute shifts, there’s an undeniable thrill in the way “Top Notch” thrashes in place, similar to watching the fight scenes from <i>Iron Man 3</i> and knowing you’re not going to get <i>that</i> from an arthouse flick. And even if the verses rarely check out, the choruses are pretty fun to yell, and if you can open your heart to yet another imperial rock song called “The Ocean”, well, it’s the most fun of the lot here. And besides, if you think you can just dial this stuff up by turning on your local “alt-rock” station, well, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCdwKhTtNNw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">there goes the Neighbourhood</a>. But four albums in, it's becoming pretty clear that the genre in which Manchester Orchestra resides has more untapped potential than the band itself.</p></div>"|19145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19145-manchester-orchestra-cope/|5.6|Ian Cohen

The inert narrator says he looks for jobs every day, then admits that he's lying. ""I sit at home and my friends get stoned."" Note that <i>he's</i> not even the one getting stoned—he's not doing anything at all, really. That void of activity is a common theme in <i>Amusements</i>; the Geelong, Australia band aren't making punk songs that are politically militant or socially conscious. Actually, they belong more in the punk tradition of bands that write lyrics that are dumb. Take the Freeze's 1980 single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMdfMIEFQAU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Hate Tourists""</a>, a catchily aggressive song about wanting to run sightseers off the road because they ""suck."" Or Dead Boys' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUfIZjU28ys&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Caught With the Meat in Your Mouth""</a>, or the King Khan &amp; BBQ Show's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdRBAdzNhsw&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tastebuds""</a>. They're delinquents who are all too ready to indulge in low-hanging fruit, writing songs about urine and feces.</p>
<p>But really, a rundown of their most base, lower-self lyrics makes <i>Amusements</i> sound much more puerile and expendable than it truly is. Jake Robertson, Billy Gardener, Shaun Connor, and Marc Dean certainly aren't the most mature band out there, but they're students of Devo, the Screamers, and Chrome. It's 12 tracks of ripping, captivating, fun synth-punk. As they shift from a deep buzzing synth to a trembling high end, Ausmuteants consistently veer far away from anything resembling <i>Computer World</i>. Instead, they invoke the kinetic, trashy attack of the essential <i>Killed By Death </i>punk compilations. ""Bad Day"" has a persistent synth churn that's bolstered by Gardener's primitive, hi-hat led stomp. Then there's ""Daylight Robbery"", which features a melody that seems appropriately urgent for a song about breaking a window in order to commit a crime in plain view of the afternoon sun.</p>
<p>As an impressive show of versatility, they kick off the B-side by briefly abandoning synthesizers altogether. The plot presented on ""Kicked in the Head By a Horse"" is given away by its title: ""He acts oh so dull/ a hoof cracked his skull."" It's the perfect premise for a pit-ready song. They've done this sort of thing before—making an exciting punk song about a violent observation—with their single ""Felix Tried to Kill Himself"", for example. These sorts of songs work along the same lines as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wd777-Iopo&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYI1-Dy0wmI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chain Saw""</a>, and most video games—violence used for ""laugh at the macabre"" means. So with material like this, it's all about delivery, and since they're adept with hooks, handclaps, and guitar solos, they can often pull it off.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Amusements</i>' juvenile posture makes it an entirely divisive record. Their primitive rhymes and nasal vocals are enough to turn people away out the gate. But then consider the basic ideas of their songs. There's one about stepping in shit and wiping it off; one song is about peeing in two streams. When you consider the song's <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/swastikas-the-screamers-ausmuteants-no-motivation-goner"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inspiration</a>, ""Fran Drescher's Alien Abduction"" is reprehensible. Then comes the album's dramatic apex: ""Pissed Myself Twice"". A paced, morose track where Robertson details exactly what went down: he was 6, the other kids were laughing at him, the teacher found a fresh pair of shorts in the lost-and-found box, and so on. The gravity given to that track, which makes it sound like the most heavy, awful thing that's ever happened, also makes it really funny. Obviously, they ride a fine line.</p>
<p>If anything, <i>Amusements</i> is a touch formulaic, as nearly every song finishes with a long instrumental stretch. But in those moments, they're playing to their strengths—hooks, grooves, and attack over lyrical prowess and vocal performance. What's undeniable, though, is that Ausmuteants create a specific, slovenly universe with their music, and while they don't move too far past the couch or the toilet, they create an exciting synth barrage from where they sit.</p></div>"|19025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19025-ausmuteants-amusements/|7.3|Evan Minsker

It succeeded wildly on the first count, the second one not so much: on singles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12873-stay-useless/"">“Stay Useless”</a> and “Fall In”, Steve Albini scoured the reverb and fuzz just to further expose Baldi's facility with bittersweet melody. Baldi gives it another go on <i>Here and Nowhere Else</i>, enlisting John Congleton to wipe away any remnant of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV3gGEC6aNY&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Hey Cool Kid”</a> and present Cloud Nothings as they’ve never been and probably never will be: a grisly, caustic punk trio knocking out harrowing and powerful singalongs in dingy basements that can barely contain the sound. Once again, though, Baldi is simply unwilling or unable to stop writing hook-filled songs, rendering <i>Here and Nowhere Else </i>even more tense and thrillingly conflicted than its predecessor.</p>
<p>In spite of the grayscale environs, Baldi <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9360-cloud-nothings-silent-shout/"">would have you believe</a> <i>Here and Nowhere Else</i> boasts a sunnier disposition than <i>Attack on Memory</i>, but the lyrics sheet is filled with brusque marching orders: a strangulated repetition of “<i>Swallow</i>” directing the listener through the desolate wilderness of “Giving Into Seeing”, and opener “Now Hear In” stating with cold equanimity, “I can feel your pain/ And I feel alright about it.” The more noticeable shift Cloud Nothings make here is physical: they try to enact themselves into right thinking by ditching just about any verbal, mental, or instrumental unnecessary baggage.</p>
<p>Regardless, Cloud Nothings have not gotten “tighter”. Baldi replaces the twinkly leads of the departed Joe Boyer by acting as both lead and rhythm guitarist, alternating low-slung, detuned riffs and shards of dissonance that owe equal debts to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7676-josh-homme/"">Josh Homme</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6772-j-robbins/"">J. Robbins</a><i>. </i>More than ever, Cloud Nothings are a band that will inspire novice guitarists to play along with their records, an important role for any band to occupy—and forget about the piano that occasionally popped up on the indulgent-by-comparison <i>Attack on Memory:</i> despite Congleton’s C.V. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Bill Callahan</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>) the most ornate production trick featured here is an echo effect liquefying Baldi into a molten puddle during the phosphene-inducing coda of “Pattern Walks”. In fact, it’s pretty much the <i>only</i> production trick on <i>Here and Nowhere Else</i>, save for the frightening<i> thwack</i> of Jayson Gerycz’s snare coming off like a percussive Wilhelm scream.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, Jayson Gerycz is the most beneficial addition to any rock band I can think of in the past decade, and <i>Here and Nowhere Else</i> reiterates that, rather than Albini, Congleton, or Baldi's newfound vocal prowess, he represents the most crucial alteration to Cloud Nothings yet. His drums are rightfully put higher in the mix than the vocals, so he speaks for Cloud Nothings just as much as Baldi does, as the two define <i>Here and Nowhere Else’</i>s mind/body dynamic where restlessness and an implacable urge for action serves as a paradoxical stasis.</p>
<p><i>Here and Nowhere Else</i> mostly moves in one direction and at a breakneck pace; by playing just ahead of the beat, taking charge of the song with torrential fills, Gerycz does everything in his power to try and throw it off course. The insatiable drive and urgency of <i>Here and Nowhere Else</i>, as well as the resulting cohesion, means that it might initially appear less ambitious than <i>Attack on Memory</i>. To call it a “grower” would be accurate, though that downplays its visceral jolt<i>, </i>as previous Cloud Nothings records revealed their high points fairly quickly; here, the initial sonic beating's reflected in the unmistakable shades of purple, black, and blue-black in the resultant bruises.</p>
<p>Baldi told Pitchfork in an earlier interview that he wasn't a punk himself growing up, but rather a musical loner who ""didn't really like anyone."" That’s a mentality easy to latch onto, as Cloud Nothings continue to make powerfully utilitarian music for people who don’t seek out this type of music just to be told what to think. They siphon punk’s righteous physicality and leave self-righteousness, victimization, and nihilism as the subject matter of the privileged. In ridding themselves of talking points, Cloud Nothings espouse a desire to live in the present moment, and that in itself is an admirable ambition. On <i>Here and Nowhere Else</i>, their music becomes a pure  resource of energy that allows the listener to do what they will.</p>
<p>Whether you use <i>Here and Nowhere Else</i> to soundtrack a grueling run or a pound-the-steering-wheel commute to work, closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16568-im-not-part-of-me/"">“I’m Not Part of Me” </a>is a hell of a victory lap, Cloud Nothings’ finest song to date. After the satisfying sensory deprivation that precedes it, the song acknowledges the bigger stages the band occupies right now, generously expanding the prior, potent austerity of Baldi’s songwriting to include an EP’s worth of hooks. It also serves as Baldi’s valedictory speech: “It starts right now/ There's a way I was before/ But I can’t recall how I was those days anymore.” He’s become a trenchant critic of his own work, and as much as the title of <i>Attack on Memory</i> spoke for itself, that lyric encapsulates everything you’ve heard on <i>Here and Nowhere Else</i>: this may very well be how Baldi imagined himself in his basement back in 2009, trying to make music that reflected the mundane despair of being a kid in Cleveland with no real propsects, while secretly striving to make music that would allow him to get the fuck out. Five years later, it’s almost impossible to remember a time when Baldi failed to hit the mark.</p></div>"|19075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19075-cloud-nothings-here-and-nowhere-else/|8.7|Ian Cohen

In the 30-year period between the time he first gained notice playing bebop with Charlie Parker to when he retired for five years in 1975, his music was usually in a state of transformation, with steady but noticeable changes occasionally interrupted by moments of what, in another context, paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould#Punctuated_equilibrium"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">punctuated equilibrium</a>.” The shifts were not linear and could never be understood in terms of “progression.” Explorations into impressionist harmony, modal improvisation, pastoral sound-painting, neoclassical orchestration, abstract funk, and sheets of electronic noise weren’t experienced as one music building on top of another, but rather a constant search for the possibilities lurking in the unknown. As the years wore on, Miles’ own fear of irrelevance kept him working with players many years younger than himself so he was being exposed to new ideas without feeling the need to chase trends (most major jazz figures with an interest in experimentation made some overtures toward free jazz in the 1960s but Miles never did). All of which is to say that when you contemplate a single, narrow segment of Miles’ brilliant and varied career, there’s no telling what the music is going to give you until you immerse yourself in it. You have to look at where it came from and where it would go next.</p>
<p><i>Miles at the Fillmore</i>, the latest entry in Columbia’s revelatory bootleg series collecting unreleased Miles Davis live material, finds the trumpeter departing one musical world and entering a new one. In the previous five years, he’d taken the music of the Second Great Quintet (Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams) as far as it could go; hearing new music in his head, music that had never been made before, Miles fully embraced electric instruments on the dual landmarks <i>In a Silent Way</i> and, a year later, in April 1970, <i>Bitches Brew</i>; most of this set was recorded in June of that year. By this point in a very busy year of live performances, <i>Bitches Brew</i> was in stores and selling well and making waves, and Miles and his band were playing large rock venues, landing on the same bills as the Grateful Dead and Neil Young.</p>
<p>Some of this material has been released in a different form. These four discs each contain an evening’s set, recorded on four consecutive nights in New York at the Fillmore East (live albums during this time can get confusing—Miles also recorded in April 1970 at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, and some of that material, in far poorer sound quality, is included as bonus tracks). On the 1970 2xLP <i>Miles Davis at Fillmore</i>, each night was condensed and edited by Teo Macero into an approximately 25-minute collage to fit a single album side and given an overarching title without identifying individual pieces (“Wednesday Miles”, “Thursday Miles”, etc.) That decision foreshadowed what was to come with Miles’ live sets through the rest of the 1970s, as written compositions and themes were considered only as additional elements to be swirled into process-oriented whole, and needn’t necessarily be identified.</p>
<p>Compared to where his music would take in the ensuing four years, Miles’ sound in mid–1970 was still loosely tethered to jazz tradition. There are distinct compositions that unfold with a set arc, there are recognizable themes, there’s still a standard in regular rotation. And unlike his music in 1974 and ’75, Miles Davis’ trumpet is very much the focus, and his tone was strong and forceful and could easily cut through the electronic din. There are two keyboard players here, both of whom would go on to become hugely popular in the 1970s: Keith Jarrett (organ) and Chick Corea (electric piano). With no guitarist in the band, Jarrett and Corea are responsible for the electronics, and each plays his instrument in ways that go well beyond its intended use; Jarrett’s squawking solos are often harsh and noisy, reminiscent of electric guitar, while Corea’s electric piano gives the music a sense of disembodied drift. Dave Holland’s basslines are simple ostinatos but feel more connected to jazz proper than the minimal funk Michael Henderson would bring a short time later. Saxophonist Steve Grossman serves a more functional role, with solid workmanlike solos that mostly serve to make Miles’ time out front that much more exciting. And Jack DeJohnette’s drumming alternates between forward-driving and hard-hitting funk/rock and pure texture during more abstract passages. DeJohnette’s contributions underscore the defining quality of the music here: it’s relentless energy.</p>
<p>The opener for each night, the Joe Zawinul composition “Directions”, sets the bar very high in this department. It’s built around a brilliantly simple bassline and has a classic theme that only shows up later in the piece, signaling when to pass the soloing baton to the next player. Miles would lose interest in this sort of structure over the next couple of years, but “Directions” is the perfect tune for him at this moment, and hearing the four show kick-offs in one place provides an opportunity to see how pieces varied from night to night. Wednesday night absolutely rips, as Holland’s bass refrain drives the song forward almost faster than the band wants to go. Thursday is comparatively mellow and exploratory, allowing for more space. On Friday DeJohnette takes a less polyrhythmic approach to drums and Miles is more fluid and less intense in his soloing. And then Saturday is lighter and trickier, with more quick rhythmic interplay. The set lists each night were almost identical—“The Mask”, “It’s About That Time”, “I Fall in Love Too Easily”, and “Bitches Brew” are all heard in multiple versions—but jumping to different takes from disc-to-disc never feels redundant, such is the invention and variation with each performance.</p>
<p>Each phase of Miles Davis’ development calls for a different kind of listening. Both 1969 and 1970, to my ears, are more accessible than the late-period material with the second quintet, with its unusual harmonies and deceptive structure. <i>Nefertiti</i> from 1967 truly feels like a puzzle, something I’ll be working to understand forever, but the appeal of the <i>Miles at the Fillmore</i> material is obvious: This is an amazing band and they rip, but they never leave traditional ideas of rhythm and melody behind. There are extended soundscape passages in “Bitches Brew” and “The Mask” that are more about experiments in timbre, exploring how jazz improvisation can become the furthest-out space music possible, but the best of this set comes in hearing these players creating a new sound that remains immediate. You’re hearing jazz form straining against its enclosure, and soon enough, it would be abandoned—by 1974, another key era, musicality would not be a priority, as black-hole-level density took over completely. Any notion of mainstream acceptance was pretty much gone by then, and Miles and his band were doing brilliant things with that freedom. Here they’re doing equally brilliant things within certain strictures, making up a few rules and bending a few others to the breaking point.</p></div>"|19079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19079-miles-davis-miles-at-the-fillmore-miles-davis-1970-the-bootleg-series-vol-3/|8.8|Mark Richardson

Even when the songwriting's not quite there, their records always sound fizzy yet full-bodied, every element floating just where it should be. They are decidedly liquid-y, capable of taking the shape of whatever container they pour themselves into. <i>Real People</i>, their new five-song EP, was written and recorded quickly in an attempt to smuggle a little more of the sweaty throb of their recent live shows into the studio. As frontman Josh Kolenik puts it, the EP is an attempt to stop overthinking things and bring a tad more ""first thought, best thought"" spontaneity into the mix.</p>
<p>Comprised of four originals and a cover of Scottish sophisti-poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24959-the-blue-nile/"">the Blue Nile</a>, <i>Real People </i>serves as a career overview for Small Black: they serve up faintly Balearic synth-pop, weightless alt-R&amp;B, and a new-wave quiverer or two. Despite Kolenik's stated intention to keep fussiness at bay, <i>Real People</i> is hardly a slapdash affair, as these five songs are just as richly detailed and expansive-sounding as anything in their catalog. But as is the case with a lot of Small Black's music, the songcraft is a little hit-or-miss.<br/><br/>Opener ""Real People"" tells the story of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colton_Harris-Moore"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colton Harris-Moore</a>, Washington State's infamous teenaged ""Barefoot Bandit"" currently serving a six-and-a-half year federal sentence for (among other things) breaking into hundreds of houses and stealing several planes. Over the plink of steel drum-like synths, Kolenik imagines himself as the bandit, examining the paintings on the wall of his latest conquest and pondering just how ""real people""—the kind who don't steal planes before they hit drinking age, I suppose—live. It's a dense, pulsating mix, cut through with swirling harmonies courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30148-frankie-rose/"">Frankie Rose</a>, but as a song, it's a bit vaporous. Kolenik's voice, as ever, stops short at ""pleasant-sounding"", and considering he's singing about an infamous child criminal, his detached vocal turn is an odd fit for the subject at hand. </p>
<p>""Lines of Latitude,"" Rose's other guest turn, is <i>Real People</i>'s finest moment. The sumptuous, gauzy ballad floats in the air, held aloft by gossamer synths and Rose and Kolenik's conjoined sighs. Kolenik's low-impact vocals are especially well-suited for a song like ""Latitude,"" a track just misty enough not to envelop him like a fog. Unfortunately, ""Consequences"" takes the opposite tack, casting him against a thick array of ominous drones, squelchy synths, and rippling bass. The chorus blares like old neon, but Kolenik gets swallowed up around the prechorus, stuck with a barely-there melody he can't quite sing his way out of. <br/><br/>The EP ends with their cover of the Blue Nile's 1989 hit ""The Downtown Lights,"" and Small Black keep the melody in tact while piling on the sonic flourishes: a relatively upbeat tempo, a few sci-fi synths swirling about, and a murky spoken-word sample. However, Kolenik's simply no match for Paul Buchanan's rich, expressive tenor, as he recedes behind all these additional bells and whistles. With most Small Black songs, you find yourself how things might've gone if Kolenik would just throw himself into his performance a touch more, and with the original ""Lights"" just a few clicks away, there's no real need to guess. The slight, somewhat spotty <i>Real People</i> is a lot like every Small Black record before it:  impossible to dislike, but hard to truly love.</p></div>"|19168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19168-small-black-real-people-ep/|5.7|Paul Thompson

What fame? I never wanted it, I never needed it/ Fame, what fame? I can be creative from behind the scenes.” The guitar tone is pure Joe Jackson, and it's likely the song itself is Davenport’s savvy imitation of a Joe Jackson bitter kiss-off to fame. On the chorus, though, the script switches slightly: Davenport leans into the punchline, “But we could talk about money,” harmonizing in a way that recalls Simply Red’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrUB0g8Vjgg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Money’s Too Tight (To Mention)</a>.” It occurs to you: Hey, actually, maybe those guitars are more reminiscent of Simply Red’s jazzy synth chords, after all. Is that intentional?</p>
<p>The answer, from a scan of Bart Davenport’s discography, is an overwhelming “yes.” His catalog is a series of nested quotations brilliantly lifted and folded into power-pop confections that he's mastered, down to the lemon zest and sea-salt sprinkles on top. Listening to “Fuck Fame,” it's not even clear if we’re hearing Bart Davenport’s thoughts or just a roundup of “fuck fame” songs strung together like a Sudoku puzzle in three dimensions.  </p>
<p>Davenport’s <i>Physical World</i> is a world of record sleeves, thumbed through masterfully. The album opens with “Wearing The Changes”, a fond and affectionate tribute to a woman who is “Wearing the changes well,” which is an elegant way to phrase aging gracefully. It’s a lion-in-winter flirtation, and the bittersweet green-apple tang of the guitar chords provide the wink and the proffered champagne glass, while Davenport slides in the clincher line: “Don’t stop doing whatever you’re doing something so right”. Again, you think: didn’t Daryl Hall say something like this? </p>
<p>This sense of constant, nagging nostalgia is kind of the point for songwriters like Davenport, who keenly understands his place in the wider universe. However, he plays too many games on <i>Physical World</i> to sustain a listener’s interest: he affects a British accent on “Dust in the Circuits,” although it’s less of a specific accent and more of an All-Purpose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a>.  “Pamela” traces a chord progression distractingly similar to “Wearing the Changes”, but with twice the glucose.</p>
<p><span>What he lacks is a presence that feels definitely Bart Davenport, and after a while, it begins to feel like an album full of someone else’s songs—or, rather, anyone else’s songs. His best moments are breezy and autumnal, where a five'o'clock shadow of soulfulness shades the proceedings. “We rely on the physical world for love/ See me cry when invisible things still hurt,” he croons gently on the title track, and while the words are lovely, the melody is the focal point, coasting up and breezing down with a reassuring ease. “Keep it light and keep it loose,” he sings, and it's one of the album’s few telling lyrics. Davenport keeps it light, but too much so, and it doesn’t take much for the entire album to float gently from your notice. </span></p></div>"|19137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19137-bart-davenport-physical-world/|6.5|Jayson Greene

But ask any aficionado to cite stalwarts—groups who’ve stuck it out without bending their sound toward the mainstream—and a few immediately come to mind: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3049-no-neck-blues-band/"">No-Neck Blues Band</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/293-bardo-pond/"">Bardo Pond</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3278-pelt/"">Pelt</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"">Oneida</a>. One outtfit not as commonly thought of, but whose unique body of work has certainly earned them a spot in this loose canon, is Los Angeles noise-rock trawlers Gang Wizard.</p>
<p>Part of the reason they’re less frequently cited is that their existence has been sporadic. Where all the aformentioned bands can claim mutliple members who’ve been involved from day one, Gang Wizard’s lineup morphs frequently, such that no single individual has participated in every stage of their career. But the group does have a core in the trio of Michael Landucci, Christopher Breedon, and Jacob Anderson, all of whom have welcomed anyone they like—including most recently Landucci’s teenage sons—into the fray.</p>
<p>Gang Wizard’s sound has a core, too. Though they come off as shambling and impulsive, they always offer a beat, riff, chant, or some other solid element to latch onto. Each song takes on a degree of shape and direction, then tears and fractures, darting around like a dog off its leash. Nothing is ever completely chaotic, but every moment trembles with fall-apart potential, which is why their music is so blood-filled and—for those who like their rock risky—so fun.</p>
<p>19 years of hammering away at this resolutely-untamed approach have made Gang Wizard pretty sharp at imprecision, and as a result <i>Important Picnic </i> might be the best of their <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/242979-Gang-Wizard"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">40 or so</a> releases. On previous efforts, their boundlessness has sometimes drifted into tedium, but there's no downtime on <i>Important Picnic</i>. Guitar noise spits around as if shot from water guns; shards of hardcore punk and grumbling bass pass through like cars running a red light; and drums get so throroughly punched, slapped, and punctured, one wonders if the band believes kits have to be broken to work right.</p>
<p>Throughout, there’s a sense that Gang Wizard are always in the midst of working things out, with the process serving as the goal. In that sense, they recall throw-it-all-out-there scramblers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3979-sun-city-girls/""><span>Sun City Girls</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4297-trumans-water/""><span>Trumans Water</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27097-harry-pussy/""><span>Harry Pussy</span></a><span>—groups whose releases obliterate the lines between jamming, practicing, and “properly” recording, if they even imagined such a thing: there’s something thrilling about music whose embryonic stage is so apparent in the final result that it’s unclear if there’s even a difference between the two.</span></p>
<p>Examples of such pulse-quickening sonic phenomena abound throughout <i>Important Picnic</i>, but one that seems to capture every dimension of what makes this band special is a stunning ramble called “Dog’s Share”. It starts low-key, with a few shards of bass fuzz and guitar cluck. But less than a minute in, strings explode into dementia, chopping the song’s weighty rhythm into a kind of musical flambé. The band not only maintains this manic pitch, but escalates it; every time you think they’ve hit their heads on the ceiling, they find a another hole to break through.</p>
<p>Such untethered imagination gives <i>Important Picnic</i> a freshness that transcends the mid-90s era in which Gang Wizard began. In fact, if this music says anything about time periods, it’s that the group’s elemental take on rock—their thirst for building it up and blowing it apart—is somewhat missing in today’s underground. More bands should be flailing away in basements and garages, treating rock like a huge water balloon to pop and drown in. If anyone out there feels so inclined, I can’t think of a better role model than Gang Wizard.</p></div>"|19159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19159-gang-wizard-important-picnic/|7.7|Marc Masters

Over the years, the Cityscape Skins—a fictional coterie of tattoo-emblazoned Twin Cities street toughs—have darkened the doorways of many a Hold Steady song. But, beyond a fleeting reference to a Skins-stocked Youth of Today show on ""Barely Breathing""—from the faintly disastrous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14196-heaven-is-whenever/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heaven Is Whenever</i></a>—it's been some time since Finn got the gang together. <i>Teeth Dreams</i>' opening line is a callback, a homing beacon to wayward fans left cold by the overblown, undercooked <i>Heaven</i>. That beautiful shit Finn used to talk? Those beer-battered barroom floors and sloppy upper-Midwestern hagiographies? That neurons-blazing, every line-better-than-the-last Minneapolis mythos? The gang's all here.</p>
<p>After four good-to-fantastic records in five short years, the Hold Steady took their sweet time and returned with 2010's <i>Heaven</i>, a too-sleek, saccharine, cliché-mottled shrug of a record. <i>Heaven</i>'s music felt bland and tentative, but its real crimes were strictly lyrical: Finn swapped out the character-defining specifics for <span>faceless</span> generalities and an all-too-sweet sincerity that effectively transplanted his lived-in Minneapolis-St. Paul mythologies to Anyplace USA. At his best, Finn wouldn't just set a scene, he'd introduce you around to the regulars. Those first few Hold Steady records still feel like a gathering of familiars, speaking a shared language. <i>Heaven</i>, then, was clearly the Hold Steady's attempt to cram a few more people into to the party. But, by swinging for the back rows, they seemed to neglect all those weird kids up front, the very ones who'd helped make their singalong songs into scriptures.</p>
<p>From its opening line on, <i>Teeth Dreams</i> announces itself as a return to form, a righting of <i>Heaven Is Whenever</i>'s manifold wrongs from the cold comfort of the upper Midwest. Squint a little, and the familiar scenery starts to take shape: the nitrous tanks under the overpasses, the Michelin in Bay City where Gideon's been working. ""I Hope This Whole Thing Didn't Frighten You"" finds Finn offering a new love a guided tour of some old haunts; ""The Ambassador"" swings around a chorus of ""you came back to us/ South Minneapolis."" Even when they're not ticking off the hours in 3.2 bars, the people of <i>Teeth Dreams</i> are very recognizably denizens of the Hold Steady universe: ""I'm pretty sure you recognize these guys,"" Finn shares on ""The Ambassador"". They're a little older now, but wiser? Well, they're still sorta working on that. They have their good days, their bad months, their off years. Oh, and they drink. Just maybe not quite so much as they used to.</p>
<p>Produced by Nick Raskulinecz (Rush, Evanescence), <i>Teeth Dreams</i> is handily the Hold Steady's worst-sounding album. The muddy, hyperbolically compressed mix dies a thousand deaths through a couple of halfway decent speakers; it opens up a smidge in headphones, but it strangles most of Finn's exhortations and grounds Tad Kubler's skyscraping solos, casting everything in an ugly, nuance-deadening grey. Musically, <i>Teeth Dreams</i> is pretty much your standard-issue late-era Hold Steady LP: a post-Replacements hard-charger here, a swaying, Schlitzed-up ballad there, all of it sturdy, none of it remotely surprising. The hard edges of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3977-separation-sunday/"" target=""_blank""><i>Separation Sunday</i></a> have been sanded down; the soaring expanses of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"" target=""_blank""><i>Boys &amp; Girls in America</i></a> have been dulled under Raskulinecz's heavy hand. Finn's delivery, in particular, gets swallowed up here: Raskulinecz buried his way back in the mix, forcing him to fight his way out of Kubler and new axeman Steve Selvidge's six-string entanglements. With so much of the music taking the path of least resistance—and without Finn up front, cracking wise to the clever kids—Raskulinecz's bizarre production seems hellbent on downplaying exactly what makes the Hold Steady the Hold Steady. Coming off a four-LP hot streak, <i>Heaven Is Whenever</i> was a tough record to hear. But <i>Teeth Dreams</i>, with its dishwater-dull, Finn-diminishing sonics, might be the harder album to actually listen to.</p>
<p>The collection does find Finn back among the third-shifters and the bartender's friends he spent so much time with on those first few Hold Steady LPs. But things, as they'll do, have changed. For starters, he's no longer into naming names: Gideon and Holly—whose addled ambling make up most of the first three Hold Steady LPs—have quickly become ""he"" and ""she,"" just a couple more pronouns in the crowd. Finn may not be writing about Holly and Gideon anymore, but he's clearly writing about people like them; they live in the same places, know the same people, favor some of the same streetcorners. Having an overarching plot to hinge these episodes around gave a record like <i>Separation Sunday</i> its novelistic depth; <i>Teeth Dreams</i>, comparatively, feels muddled, 10 thumbnail sketches of the down-and-out rather than one long, hard-fought journey towards redemption.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Teeth Dreams</i> isn't meant as a redemption story; instead, it's a record about perseverance. Nameless or not, these people have clearly been through something; for the time being, they're trying to get over it without falling back under it. They find themselves in codependent relationships with complicated backstories, they take—and then try to shake—dope, and they're all stricken by what Finn, on ""On With the Business,"" dubs ""that American sadness."" These are people who've been seriously rocked by life, but they're mostly past that now; they're taking it one day at a time, with a friendly assist from the ""salted rims and frosted mugs.""</p>
<p>""Spinners"" finds him advising a recent divorcee to get back out there; ""it's a big city,"" he insists, and ""there's a lot of love."" But his sympathies get the better of him on the the faintly Dylanesque ""Wait a While""; different woman, similar situation, yet—in an unchracteristically regressive turn—he's taken to calling this one ""little girl"" and reminding her ""there's other words than yes."" On ""Big Cig,"" Finn conjures a pill-popping, mind-changing, value-minded chain-smoker of his recent acquaintence: it's an easy highlight, the kind of impossibly clever, unusually tender character study Finn's always excelled at.</p>
<p>But for every ""Big Cig"", there's a ""Runner's High"",a half-told, half-remembered California-by-way-of-Texas dope deal gone horribly awry. Time was, you could hardly get through a Hold Steady song without an intimate knowledge of everybody's sister's names and what high school they dropped out of. But ""High,"" like a lot of<i> Teeth</i>, plays things a little close to the chest; you don't have to guess at anybody's motivations, but you never quite get to know the people in these songs the way you did all those would-be DJs at the Swish and all their little hoodrat friends.</p>
<p>Dreams about teeth are typically interpreted as <a href=""http://dreammoods.com/cgibin/teethdreams.pl?&amp;search=teethintro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stemming</a> ""from a fear of rejection, sexual impotence or the consequences of getting old."" We're probably better off ignoring those first two, but for a band like the Hold Steady—who've seen their share of divorce, disease, and abrupt departures over the years—time's inexorable march can't ever be too far from their minds. The people in Craig Finn's songs have gone through plenty themselves: from the poppers, pills and Pepsi of the early days to the post-breakup malaise and routine regret that hangs over <i>Teeth Dreams</i> like a fog. You can't say they've aged gracefully, exactly, but they've done the best they could, and things do seem to be looking up.</p>
<p>The best thing about <i>Teeth Dreams</i> is seeing these people succeed, even in the smallest of ways. But it's those same small, steady steps that hold <i>Teeth Dreams</i> back. There are triumphs here, but they're modest; there is, after all, little fanfare to be found in just getting up and on with it day in and day out. Consequently, <i>Teeth Dreams</i>—even more than the flavorless <i>Heaven Is Whenever</i>—occasionally feels like the first Hold Steady record that's just going through the motions: introducing a few punchy chords to a few wayward souls and letting them get on with it. All that desperation, redemption, and triumphalism you'll still find on the Hold Steady's first few albums has become a kind of everyday pragmatism here: not every night, he seems to be saying, needs to be so massive.</p>
<p>It's this, I think, that keeps <i>Teeth Dreams</i> from being a true return to form: these people don't especially seem all that keen on going back to their old ways, even when they're not exactly sure how to make those changes stick. <i>Teeth Dreams</i> goes out on a high: ""Oaks,"" a sweeping, epic-length chest-clutcher, depicts two star-crossed addicts who may not even make it down the block without copping something they know they shouldn't. Like the Hold Steady themselves, they don't always get things right, but it's hard not to root for 'em anyway.</p></div>"|19122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19122-the-hold-steady-teeth-dreams/|6.4|Paul Thompson

As one-half of Sepalcure, he and Praveen Sharma released a confident self-titled debut that refracted bass music in a soft, pink-hued light without losing any creative edge. Stewart’s crowning achievement in that year, however, was his Planet Mu LP as Machinedrum, <i>Room(s)</i>. An embarrassment of riches that fused footwork’s 3D rhythmic patterns, bass’ double-time gait, and emotive vocal samples, <i>Room(s)</i> stands as one of the strongest electronic full-lengths of the decade so far. It was a true crossover album that discarded notions of innovation and originality in favor of delivering a rich, almost overwhelming listening experience.</p>
<p><i>Room(s)</i> represented a creative ideal for Stewart. He spent the previous decade hopping from sound to sound—glitchy IDM, low-slung Dilla-influenced hip-hop instrumentals—while mostly staying anonymous. <i>Room(s)</i> caused many to sit up and take notice, though, and he seized the opportunity in typically canny fashion: production work for major-label casualty Azealia Banks, a slick EP of candy-coated techno for Glasgow label LuckyMe, and a load of one-off cuts and data-dump EPs that have kept the Machinedrum name a near-constant presence. Following a high-profile signing to Ninja Tune, Stewart put the distractions aside for a moment and returned last year with <i>Room(s)</i>’ proper follow-up, <i>Vapor City</i>, an album that found him smoothing out the terrain of its predecessor. The record didn’t pack the same thrilling punch of <i>Room(s)</i>’ finest moments, coming over more as a the sound of an artist sticking with the sound that gained him notice—which, in Stewart’s case, isn’t a bad thing.</p>
<p>On the outset, his new EP as Machinedrum, <i>Fenris District</i>, resembles a victory lap after <i>Vapor City</i>’s modest successes, but its content suggests that Stewart’s ear is wandering yet again—this time, towards the bounce-heavy motifs and that make up the increasingly jocular spin on trap popularized by artists such as TNGHT and Dillon Francis. The release contains three new cuts, two of which make make the shift clear: “On My Mind” opens with a high-frequency whine and clipped snares before sinking into dubby synth stabs and sensory-depriving bass frequencies, while “Neujack” samples an utterance of its title’s second syllable and subjects it to a series of pitch-warped filters, filling the resulting space with piled-up claps and, yes, more deep bass. Those coming to hear Stewart in his lane are rewarded early with the EP’s highlight, “Back Seat Ho”, which takes the ear-blasting sonics of its counterparts and throws in soft synth pads and pleasingly emotive textures in its back half. It’s the strongest representation of Stewart’s successful aesthetic since <i>Vapor City</i>’s evocative opener “Gunshotta”.</p>
<p><i>Fenris District</i> is rounded out by two remixes: Adrian Sherwood and bass mainstay Pinch offer a take on <i>Vapor City</i>’s downcast first single “Eyesdontlie”, adding pitch-black vibes to the tune with broken piano lines and occasional ragga vocal samples. It’s an intriguing take, if not an especially engaging one. Glasgow wünderkind Rustie does them one better on his remix of “Back Seat Ho”. Rustie is exploring new territory yet again, attacking “Back Seat Ho”’s endlessly sampled vocal with nasty buzzsaw sounds before clearing the arena for city-leveling drums possessing a nihilistic brutality.</p>
<p>Contrasted with <i>Glass Swords</i>’ penchant for wild-eyed optimism, Rustie’s “Back Seat Ho” remix scans darker and represents a great artist trying (and succeeding) to chart his own path; his self-assured sense of originality presented here makes Stewart look inferior by comparison and presents a strange conundrum regarding where he takes the Machinedrum project next. After two albums of the same sound, it certainly wouldn’t hurt for Stewart to branch out, but that would risk losing the attention that he spent over 10 years trying to attain. Both history and the originals on <i>Fenris District</i> suggest that, for Stewart, trying something new doesn’t so much mean embracing originality as much as it does trying on other people’s clothes. Which leaves the Machinedrum project at a crossroads, and it’ll be interesting to see which path he takes going forward.</p></div>"|19126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19126-machine-drum-fenris-district-ep/|6.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

Announced in January—no advance snippets were available—and released digitally in February, 2NE1 dropped two singles simultaneously (the uptempo pair “Come Back Home” and “Gotta Be You”). Though both unsurpisingly lit up the Korean charts, the excitement—as well as an appearance in a January episode of ABC’s <i>The Bachelor</i>—buoyed an entrance into Billboard 200, where 2NE1 <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/5923212/2ne1-sets-new-us-record-for-highest-charting-best-selling-k-pop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sold more copies in the first week</a> than any Korean outfit in history. The only semi-micro-plotted movement in the whole campaign happened when YG Entertainment bumped the digital release three days—meaning that they broke the record in four days, instead of a full seven—so it would come out on the February 27 birthday of CL, 2NE1’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LP4foN3Xs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ascendant star</a>. Hold that thought.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As one could imagine, <i>Crush</i> is similarly fashioned around the shapeshifter CL, who wrote lyrics and composed three songs on the album in addition to the solo thumper “MBTD”. <i>Crush</i>, in total, is exactly the stylemash you’ve become accustomed to from the group, a release that bottles up contemporary trends (such as the blurry trap sound frequented by Future and others) as well as the usual EDM/reggae/hip-hop/R&amp;B hybrid that YG’s in-house producers favor for the quartet. While the instinct to position the versatile CL in the front of 2NE1 is right on, her compositions fall a <i>hair</i> short of <i>Crush</i>’s standouts, which include the earworms “Come Back Home” and “Happy” as well the subtle, pretty G-Dragon-penned ballad “Good to You”. But it’s not a “sore thumb” situation: CL stacks up to the more experienced hands of the YG factory, and thus seems primed for a huge solo career. <i>Crush</i> represents a sleeker, more refined vision for the group; if nothing else, the well-balanced record serves as a capsule of the outfit’s pop instincts and versatility. Though the soulful, organ-spiked R&amp;B take “Baby I Miss You” might be the most natural fit for the group, they generally make a breeze of it, bolstering strong performances by the ensemble of Dara, Minzy and Park Bom.</p>
<p>In his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8700-to-anyone-the-rise-of-korean-wave/"" target=""_blank"">K-Pop primer</a> from 2011, James Brooks made much of 2NE1's brash, attention-grabbing ethos; <i>Crush </i>finds them wisely dialing back the assault. And, unlike G-Dragon’s strained crossover attempt <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18569-g-dragon-coup-detat/"">Coup d’Etat</a>, YG’s team—primarily the producers Teddy, DEE.P and CHOICE 37—create something fairly universal on <i>Crush</i>. Like a number of records in this vein, there are a handful of moments that push the sound’s signature maximalism too far—I would argue that “Come Back Home” holds up plenty well without the skizz-skizz-WOMP-WOMP-WOMP breakdown stapled to the bridge—but maybe that’s a little like penalizing a Swans album for having too many guitars. With <i>Crush</i>, 2NE1 succeed on their inlaid mission statement—they've made music for anyone.</p></div>"|19165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19165-2ne1-crush/|7.3|Corban Goble

Following 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15570-black-up/""><i>Black Up</i></a>, vocal collaborators <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30183-theesatisfaction/"">THEESatisfaction</a> spun Shabazz Palaces' subterranean feel  into their 2012 debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16444-awe-naturale/"">awE naturalE</a></i>, while Maraire released a solo album expanding on the traditional Zimbabwean music he’d brought to the collaboration. Each project has resembled a distinct piece of art, but when considered together, they represent a group of musicians with a connected set of sensibilities.</p>
<p>The latest project to spin off from this collective is Chimurenga Renaissance, an act helmed by Maraire alongside Hussein Kalonji and a crew of guests, including Lazaro. As he did on his solo album, Maraire finds another opening in Shabazz Palaces' porous template and reaches through it—this time, to his own father Dumisani Maraire, who's credited with bringing Zimbabwean music (specifically, the wind chime-like flutter of an instrument called the mbira) to Seattle in the 1960s. That marimba-adjacent sound, which breathed air and light into some of Shabazz Palaces’ dense arrangements, takes center stage on <i>riZe vadZimu riZe</i>, and highlights the connection between Tendai Maraire’s father and the work he does today.</p>
<p>But if <i>riZe vadZimu riZe</i> is an ethnomusicological lesson, it’s a light one, as the album filters traditional Zimbabwean music through Maraire’s contemporary hip-hop lens in a way that should feel accessible to anyone with an interest in experimental-leaning rap. Maraire approaches rapping more directly than Lazaro, layering his verses bluntly on top of the psychedelic sprawl of his instrumentation rather than weaving himself through it. He’s also more explicitly political, handling talking points in a way that feels reminiscent of Digable Planets’ first two albums, but with a somberness that places him more in line with someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2348-talib-kweli/"">Talib Kweli</a>. Maraire speaks to Zimbabwe’s history (“chimurenga” translates to “struggle”), but this is classic <i>message</i> rap that spans regionality—music that shuns crooked cops, fancy sneakers, Mercedes Benzes, Islamophobia, fake romances, corporate sponsorships, the media, the system.</p>
<p>Those themes have often bubbled to the surface on Shabazz Palaces albums, but they’re heavy-handed to the point of cartoonishness at times on <i>riZe vadZimu riZe</i>: “Just look at what success is/ Diamond kicks and Benzes,” Maraire raps, indignant on “The Race for Cush Naptha”. “Spending money you don’t have/ Just so you can fit in.” Sometimes, he resembles a public service announcement: “There’s consequences to what you do/ When the cops get crooked the goons will shoot,” he preaches on “It’s Bigger Than You”. On that same song, Lazaro comes off like a snarling class clown by comparison: “You struck it rich but that don’t mean that your bitch-ass ain’t corny,” he adds. “You know some killers, hustlers, strippers/ Nigga, who don’t?” Maraire, luckily, knows how to buffer the preachiness of his rapping with playful instrumentation, a habit that's made Shabazz Palaces so uniquely enticing. When his message starts to feel oppressive, the sound of the mriba takes some of the pressure off—and we can thank his father for that.</p></div>"|19169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19169-chimurenga-renaissance-rize-vadzimu-rize/|6.8|Carrie Battan

With clattering drums and crackling amplifiers, the trio wound again and again through one sticky riff, alternately stretching and strengthening it; at one point, a ghoulish choir even harmonized with it. When the band paused briefly, their dramatic stop marked their lord’s grand entrance. “All those who hail to my crown,” the Wizard sang, his theatrical tone arching above the volume to play his required role and address his suppliants. “I know your name.” The six songs on <i>Misery Wizard</i> hinged on that voice, registering Pilgrim as heirs apparent to a lineage that included Black Sabbath and Candlemass. They weren’t looking to break boundaries, integrate extreme technicality, or even be very grandiloquent, like their peers of the moment, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"" target=""_blank"">Pallbearer</a>. They seemed content to follow big riffs for long trips around fables concerning crystals and elders, wizards and pariahs, all delivered by a voice that seemed like a relic faithfully restored from a bygone era.</p>
<p>At least initially, their follow-up, the new <i>II: Void Worship</i>: seems to follow that same basic setup. A rather playful, guitar-only intro sets up a sudden full-band bash, the rhythm section hammering out a doleful beat beneath an ascendant electric theme. When it all quiets down, the Wizard steps in again, his voice deeper now but his authority intact: “In the master’s chamber/ I was turned to stone,” he sings in lockstep with his guitar. The Wizard sings two verses, cresting in the second as he relays the peril of a spell (or fever dream?) that’s left his head spinning. And on the short, stomping successor “The Paladin”, the Wizard sounds again like a vintage frontman, his story of vigilante justice cast in reverb and delivered like a battle cry. Between its build-up and payoff, its terse verses and dense solo, “The Paladin” is the automatic single of the first two Pilgrim albums, an efficient encapsulation of all this band’s assets.</p>
<p>But then the Wizard, or at least his voice, disappears for 10 minutes. Pilgrim lurks through the instrumental dirge “Arcane Sanctum” and then rips through its inverse, an aggressive wordless lunge called “In the Process of Evil”. These brief, complementary pieces offer a mid-album revelation for <i>Void Worship</i>, because it’s here that Pilgrim’s biggest change between albums becomes clear: They don’t depend upon the Wizard’s retrofitted voice like they once did. Aside from the exasperated chant he leads at the end of “Master’s Chamber”, he actually sings on only about a quarter of the album’s opening epic. Though his tale of demonic seduction serves as the centerpiece of closer “Away from Here”, with his voice dipping into a bellow and peaking into a thespian’s falsetto, the story only consumes a small sliver of the song. The rest goes to the riff and the rhythm, advancing in perfectly deliberate unison and pushing into a void of variation. Last year, Pilgrim’s bassist, Count Elric the Soothsayer, took his leave, forcing the band to reconsider their approach and adjust to life as a duo. They seem to have taken this is an invitation not to thin their sound but rather to reinforce it; on drums, the wonderfully named Krolg Splinterfist, Slayer of Men moves with the Wizard’s guitar with a twin sense of economy and power. The Wizard also adds bass, and his approach is more oriented to fortifying his own guitar melodies and tying them to the drums than necessarily developing a distinct voice. <i>Void Worship</i> sounds more relentless and loaded than its predecessor, even though Pilgrim often forgoes the additional layer of vocals. Coupled with proper production in New Jersey’s Moonlight Mile studio, Pilgrim sounds appropriately massive for its proper Metal Blade entrance.  </p>
<p>The Wizard’s relative restraint will no doubt disappoint some of Pilgrim’s early adopters, as it was a calling card for the band’s 21st century anachronism. But the move also helps to fade Pilgrim’s timestamp, or the sense that they champion an era so much that they could be a vestige of it. Their abiding sense of doom remains intact, and Pilgrim now seem one step ahead of their heritage, capable of writing around the records from which they learned. Perhaps if Pilgrim add a permanent new bassist, they’ll resort to their earlier approach, and the Wizard’s classic air will push back toward. But for now, <i>Void Worship</i> takes what was essential about <i>Misery Wizard </i>and compacts it while expanding Pilgrim’s overall scope—a fitting progression for a pair of genre loyalists.  </p></div>"|19076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19076-pilgrim-ii-void-worship/|7.4|Grayson Haver Currin

At the heart of the matter lies a simple truth: it's difficult to cast a critical eye over something you’ve grown up with, a presence you've always taken as gospel. So it must be said that not everything Johnny Cash recorded was hewn from pure gold. We sometimes need reminding that despite his larger-than-life existence, at the end of the day he was but a man, one who made plenty of mistakes, both personal and musical. Cash’s flawed humanity is one of the reasons why so very many people were drawn to him, and why we remember him still. This newest addition to his ever-expanding body of posthumous work, an album originally recorded 30 years ago but never released at the time, provides additional context for one of the strangest and most flawed periods of his career, and offers up a few damn good tunes in the bargain.</p>
<p><i>Out Among the Stars</i> dates to the 1980s, which may as well have been Cash’s lost decade. Nashville was so enamored of its rhinestone cowboys and gritty outlaws that the Man in Black slipped between the cracks and, in his own words, became largely invisible. His rough-and-tumble persona had been softened by television appearances and married life, and it didn’t help that his three decades with Columbia Records had left both Cash and the label sour on one another. The early 80s marked a high point in the chart battle between Bakersfield-influenced pop country and the burgeoning outlaw scene, and it was during this uncertain period between 1981 and 1984 that the <i>Out Among the Stars</i> sessions took place. Cash showed his chameleon colors by electing to record a duet with notorious rabble-rouser Waylon Jennings called “I’m Moving On”, and this move—not to mention his close ties with Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson thanks to their shared time as the Highwaymen—seemed to place his allegiance firmly in the outlaw camp. And yet, the sessions were recorded with <i>au courant</i> countrypolitan hitmaker Billy Sherrill. The album was shelved and remained in the vault until Cash’s son John Carter Cash stumbled across the recordings in 2012 and, joined by co-producer Steve Berkowitz and musicians Marty Stuart, Buddy Miller, and Carlene Carter, restored the album for release.</p>
<p>The thing about Johnny Cash has always been that when he’s on, he’s great, but when he’s not, it can be jarring and almost uncomfortable, like seeing a favorite uncle swig from a hip flask at Christmas. <i>Out Among the Stars</i> is strongest when it stays close to his roughshod roots and rock’n’roll spirit, and it fumbles when it comes to the sappy stuff. There are only a few awkward moments, but they’re hard to ignore. Still, the good outweighs the bad, and you couldn’t be faulted for picking and choosing your sips of poison here. Given its origins, it’s no small wonder that the album comes off more as a collection of songs rather than a unified whole; listening to it all in one go dims a bit of the individual songs’ sparkle.</p>
<p>But man, do some of these cuts sparkle. The opening title track is classic Cash: straightforward and conversational, with punchy Springsteen-gone-bad lyrics (“It’s midnight at a liquor store in Texas, closing time and now the day is done/ When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol, he can’t find a job, but Lord, he’s found a gun”) and a rollicking beat. The protagonist remains a sympathetic figure even as he turns to crime and, as is his wont, Cash puts a lot of himself into those words. It’s a reassuring way to open the album and it dovetails nicely with “Baby Ride Easy”, the first and better of Johnny’s two duets with June; ""Easy"" is a homespun exchange with an easy twang and bouncy upbeat, and third wheel Carlene Carter’s backing harmonies add a little extra fullness to June’s verses.</p>
<p>On the downside, “After All” is a gospel-tinged piano ballad about lost love that constitutes the album’s weakest three minutes. Cash’s warm baritone is the focal point, but the track feels more schmaltzy than sincere. A few other ballads fair better. “Tennessee” is a nostalgic love note to his birthplace replete with weepy strings and a children’s chorus, and “Don’t You Think Its Come Our Time” is another endearingly sweet duet with June backed by a gentle mix of acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, and upright bass. Saccharine and earnest, the pair sound more like a mooney-eyed young couple singing at a church social; with anyone else, it would sound utterly hackneyed, but their chemistry makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Turns out Johnny the heartbreaker is ultimately a lot more fun to listen to than Johnny the loyal husband. The simple country traipse of “If I Told You Who It Was” sees Cash get nice and comfortable in his role as a storyteller with a wink and a grin, spinning a yarn about a nameless country star with a figure that just won’t quit. “I Drove Her Out of My Mind” makes good use of his oaky baritone and just begs to be played in a dingy barroom full of jilted shadows, while steel guitar swinger “Rock and Roll Shoes” sees Cash unapologetic as ever, trucking along defiantly with a rockabilly strut. “She Used to Love Me A Lot” is best known as a David Allen Coe tune, but as it turns out, Cash beat him to it by a scant few weeks. Though Coe’s delivery is uncharacteristically somber on his rendition, Cash’s version is an even quieter, more staid affair that finds him accompanied by a muted choir and soberly plucked acoustic strings. Where Coe howls, Cash mourns.</p>
<p>Closing track “I Came to Believe”, a Cash original, offers an illuminating contrast to his late period, since it also appeared on his 2006 album <i>V: A Hundred Highways</i>. While the modern version is sparse and fragile, this piano-driven, gospel-influenced number showcases his voice at its finest. He lacks the later gravitas, but his strong, pure baritone easily commands attention and, wrapped around a song of hope and redemption, it ends the album on a high note.</p>
<p>Johnny Cash is an American archetype—Paul Bunyan with a battered acoustic or Davy Crockett with a dobro tucked under his famous cap. To many of us, the low rumble of his voice is a comforting and familiar sound, and while we’ll never get him back, it’s nice to come across his ghost on recordings like this.

He also once played the Four Tops on faucets in a Delta commercial. But even before his tenure with Tweedy in Wilco and Loose Fur, Kotche wrote and performed contemporary classical music. His previous albums of original works foregrounded himself as a virtuoso performer, but on <i>Adventureland</i>, a new collection of pieces for chamber ensembles, he’s a composer first and foremost.</p>
<p>As a percussionist writing music based around the obsessive repetition of small, pulsating melodic cells, Kotche automatically puts himself in the shadow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a>, even quoting the elder composer on “Clapping Music Variations” and “Individual Trains” from 2006’s <i>Mobile</i>. But though he constructs his work from similar building blocks to Reich’s, the pivot points in Kotche’s pieces are more frequent and jarring. He roughens minimalism around the edges and speeds up its action, forcing the listener to adapt quickly to constant metrical changes.</p>
<p>“The Haunted Suite”, the better of the two large works that make up the bulk of <i>Adventureland</i>, is full of these unexpected turns of phrase. Kotche works in his area of greatest expertise, writing for a horde of pitched and unpitched percussion instruments and two pianos. Each movement in “The Haunted Suite” focuses on a different eerie, real-life location, and the shifting scenery inspires radical musical contrasts. The acerbic “The Haunted Furnace” evokes the ruins of a steel mill in Alabama, and takes a page out of the book of the early 20th-century American composer Henry Cowell’s uncanny, tone-cluster-ridden piano music. Similarly herky-jerky rhythms and dissonances arise in the lively “The Haunted Dance”, but the piece is much more restrained dynamically, channeling Indonesian gamelan music. The “Haunted Hive” moment is a percussion-only piece which, unlike the other sections, deals entirely in ambient, sometimes onomatopoeic sound.</p>
<p>In “Anomaly”, a larger-scale work originally written for and performed by the Kronos Quartet, Kotche adopts a less diverse approach. His liner notes mention that some of the piece’s sections were composed on drum kit; it makes sense, then, that the metrical patterns are its most interesting elements. Unfortunately, the actual pitched material often feels like an afterthought, and it's certainly a bit too familiar, coming across like movie-soundtrack-ready pseudo-minimalism with a pop harmonic sensibility. It’s also too bad that Kotche doesn’t further embrace the possibilities of his chosen instruments, considering he has the world’s premier avant-garde string quartet at his disposal. Unusual string timbres arise only briefly, elsewhere on the album, in the muted middle section of the collage piece “Triple Fantasy”.</p>
<p>So the most compelling section of “Anomaly” is the first, one that Kotche realized electronically instead of with the quartet. The dizzying melodic counterpoint is rendered on what sounds like a water-damaged version of Thom Yorke’s Rhodes on “Everything in its Right Place”, and fractured increasingly by electronic manipulation. This treatment provides the piece with the textural interest that its other sections lack; it’s the one moment where Kotche embraces the noise, grit and incidental sounds which amplify his best work, from his free improvisational recordings to “Ashes of American Flags”. </p></div>"|19123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19123-glenn-kotche-adventureland/|7.2|Winston Cook-Wilson

Whether it was the Pacific Symphony's 2013 ""<a href=""http://www.reriteofspring.org/remix/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ReRite</a>"", the Metropolis Ensemble's ""<a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92751852"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">T</a><a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92751852"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he Rite: Remixed</a>"", Darryl Brenzel's big band jazz version, or Golem's death metal take, new entrants regularly succumb to the impulse to fiddle with Stravinsky's era-shaping masterwork, and now the Bad Plus are stepping up to the plate. The jazz trio won acclaim by twisting hard rock and punk songs into jazz language, a trick riddled with steep hazards: cleverness on one side, and terminal lameness on the other.  The trio, sure-handed and steely, evaded both traps, folding Davie Bowie, Queen, and Rush covers alongside their own compositions. </p>
<p>Tackling Stravinsky's <i>Rite</i> arises fresh hazards. They no longer risk accusations of novelty, but they also enter, for the first time, a crowded field. And while no sane person would refer to the task of transposing the entirety of the orchestral <i>Rite</i> into jazz trio as ""easy"", they also wander much closer to jazz-friendly language when engaging with Stravinsky's work. The composer was thrilled and enraptured by jazz rhythms and harmonies, and jazz musicians worshiped Stravinsky. (Pretty much everyone worshiped Stravinsky.)  So what happens when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/532-the-bad-plus/"" target=""_blank"">the Bad Plus</a> make the closest they've come to a ""conventional"" decision?</p>
<p>The premonitory shudder of the opening woodwind line, which bandleader Ethan Iverson brings under both hands of the piano, is a promising beginning. The piano notes refract in the mix in the mix like light through a water glass, and after a minute or so, some tasteful, if slightly dated, electronics enter. They have an air-conditioned, late-'90s trip-hop feel to them, and they are the first sign of rocky waters ahead. It's not that there's anything inappropriate about electronics: Some of the Bad Plus's touches that might sound gimmicky on paper, like a sampled female voice uttering a sharp intake of breath during the ""Introduction"" section, are its most vivid moments. This is a ballet about the thrilling violence of young lust, after all.</p>
<p>The trouble is that the electronics feel pat, and slightly obvious, and they signal that for the first time in their career, the Bad Plus are simply outgunned. The contemplative, brooding sections of Stravinsky's ballet translate the best—the yearning tug of the chords in ""Spring Rounds"" translate into dark glowing left-hand work. Double bassist Reid Anderson creeps on cat feet during the ""Evocation of the Ancestors/Ritual Action of the Ancestors"" movement, while drummer Dave King bows some effectively eerie whines on the cymbals.</p>
<p>But the fiercest sections suggest that the Bad Plus just aren't a match for the full blast of Stravinsky's orchestra. ""The Augurs of Spring"" is one of the most menacing moments in 20<sup>th</sup>-century music, in which the orchestra lands on a tendon-crunching composite chord dozens of times, the thudding downbeat a throw rug constantly disappearing beneath your feet. In the Pierre Boulez recording with the Cleveland Orchestra from 1969, these hits feel stunning, inhuman, like steel hammers hitting dead flesh. Banged on the low-end of the piano with Dave King's kick drum to support it, the section sounds almost...dinky. The <i>Rite</i> can be all kinds of things—breathless, lustful, pitiless—but ""dinky"" can never be one of them.</p>
<p>The feat is still impressive, in an athletic way. The trio have been mapping out this version in concert for years, and you could never accuse them of scaling this mountain without planning ahead of time.  But the <i>Rite</i> should elicit gasps, not cock eyebrows—the latter of which is the most extreme reaction the Bad Plus manage to provoke. It's ironic that after tackling (and matching) Black Sabbath and Nirvana, it would be Stravinsky that would finally make the Bad Plus sound positively tame. </p></div>"|19160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19160-the-bad-plus-the-rite-of-spring/|6.7|Jayson Greene

Despite the way it's presented, <i>Dylan's Gospel</i>, the sole album by the Brothers and Sisters (aka the Brothers &amp; Sisters of Los Angeles, aka the Los Angeles Gospel Choir—it's been reissued a few times), did not arise from a group of L.A. area gospel singers deciding what they really wanted to do was record some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan </a>songs. The idea came from producer and Ode Records chief Lou Adler, who can't help but have noticed that the Edwin Hawkins Singers' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfGDvDGE7zk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oh Happy Day""</a> had recently become the first full-on black gospel choir recording to hit the Pop Top Five.</p>
<p>Adler's choir and soloists had, indeed, mostly learned to sing in church. But the ""Brothers and Sisters"" were recruited from the L.A. backup-singer circuit—if you've seen <i>20 Feet from Stardom</i>, you've seen a lot of their names, and if you've ever listened to classic-rock radio, you've heard their voices on other people's records. Over two days in July, 1969, the group recorded churchified versions of 10 familiar Dylan tunes, including his then-current single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ODMKSWzT4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lay Lady Lay""</a>, a song that's about as secular as Bob has ever gotten. This is formally the same kind of record as, say, a set of Imagine Dragons songs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWe_i9uqxd4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">arranged as lullabies</a>, rather than a direct antecedent to the terrific 2003 tribute-with-the-honoree's-input <i>Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan</i>.</p>
<p>That said, it's way better than it has a right to be: it's always at least interesting, and often pretty delightful. If you didn't catch the words, <i>Dylan's Gospel</i> could pass as a solidly played, splendidly sung ""contemporary gospel"" record, and if you can overlook the choir keeping a straight face as they raise the roof about ""her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls"", it can pass as that even if you <i>do</i> catch the words. By the time Adler's choir assembled, Dylan was still a decade away from writing overtly Christian songs, but he'd internalized the whole gospel songbook by the time he started writing his own stuff: the language of ""Chimes of Freedom"" and ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" makes the stylistic transition beautifully. His lyrics were also open wide enough to interpretation that it wasn't hard to come up with a reading of, say, ""The Mighty Quinn"" as an impassioned if slightly eccentric parable about Christ's return, which is exactly how the great Merry Clayton delivers it here.</p>
<p>A few iffy aspects of the project reveal its origins as a cash-in. The vocalists are credited in a list, but the lead singers weren't initially identified as such—""because of contractual obligations,"" Adler <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dylan-gets-gospel-treatment-in-l-a-19690712"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claimed to <i>Rolling Stone</i></a> at the time. (The new reissue's liner notes indicate that it's definitely Gloria Jones on ""I'll Be Your Baby Tonight"", for what that's worth, and Honey Cone's Edna Wright on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prci7iRaW2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lay Lady Lay""</a>.) Master session bassist Jerry Scheff, who would play on Dylan's <i>Street-Legal</i> nine years later, was identified on the original sleeve as ""Jerry O. Scheft."" Some of the singers also don't seem to have been too familiar with Dylan's material: whoever sings the ""My Back Pages"" verse containing ""mutiny from stern to bow"" makes that line rhyme with ""slow,"" a mistake you'd only make if you were reading it off a lyric sheet and hadn't noticed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZwncQfvaKk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">how every verse ends</a>. </p>
<p>Still, sometimes exploitative impulses eventually yield things nobody anticipates. One of the Sisters on <i>Dylan's Gospel </i>was Clydie King, who'd been recording hither and thither since she'd made her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RXusY9mj-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first single</a> as Little Clydie as a 12- or 13-year-old in 1956. (If that's not her ripping it up on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B79H0GP34KU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mr. Tambourine Man""</a> here, it's somebody with a very similar voice.) King spent most of the 70s as a top-flight backup singer for rock bands: 11 years after she sang with Adler's ad-hoc group, she started dating Dylan, and became his creative collaborator for the next few years, often singing solo during his gospel-era concerts and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBl8oZRwhvw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">duetting with him</a> on stage and on record. ""Clydie's one of the greatest singers ever,"" Dylan said. ""I get chills when I hear her just breathe.""</p></div>"|19077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19077-brothers-and-sisters-dylans-gospel/|7.0|Douglas Wolk

But he's not exactly willing to use labels—and why should he? In a recent <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/horseback-jenks-miller"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, Miller avoids the slippery slope of compartmentalization by situating Horseback within a broader tradition of psychic exploration and visceral expression, birthed by the blues and embedded within the musical DNA of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>, and Richard Thompson alike: ""As far as I'm concerned,"" he says, ""all esoteric music is bonded by blood. I love it all."" Indeed, Miller's sanguine palette has shifted in tone at various points throughout Horseback's seven-year existence, producing such disparate offspring as the serene, spacious 2007 debut <i>Impale Golden Horn </i>and its snarling, frostbitten descendent, 2012's <i>Half-Blood</i>. The latest Horseback album, <i>Piedmont Apocrypha</i>, compacts this meandering trajectory into a five-song narrative that's inclusive,<i> </i>intriguing, and unquestionably creepy.</p>
<p class=""p1""> That the overwhelming majority of <i>Piedmont Apocrypha</i> is comprised of labyrinthine soundscapes is to be expected. Horseback songs have always been dominated by Miller's repetitive, circular structures, be they're in the guise of ribbons of feedback or forlorn twang, and his mantras are the compositional and thematic cornerstones of the structures that strengthen with every verse, every repetition, and every second. At the same time, closer inspection reveals the din to be anything but static: the snakelike line of drone that runs through opening dirge ""Passing Through"" courses like an open wire, threatening to swallow the entire song whole at a moment's notice, while the tonal irregularity of the spindled arpeggios that drive ""Consecration Blues"" (created by running two amplifiers with different tonal qualities) grows more dire and unsettling by the second. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Even the prettiest of pastorals—conjured by the warm acoustic guitar of the title track and insect rhythms of ""Milk and Honey""—decay the second they reach your ears, fostering a sense of dread that never goes away completely. Not even the return of frequent Horseback collaborators Rich James, Nick Petersen, and John Crouch for the 18-minute closer, ""Chanting Out The Low Shadow"", proffers relief. Miller's mix subdues the intensity of his death growls, and later, his singing, by shrouding them in the solemn boogie of his bandmates. As a result, <i>Piedmont Apocrypha</i> offers little in the way of easy satisfaction or cathartic handouts—that is, aside from the title track's combustive finale, a hot, shimmery mess that unfurls several minutes' worth of stored energy in one go.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Miller's fascination with the dark side of the human psyche resonates strongly on <i>Piedmont Apocrypha.</i> Delivered in a creepy, lilting tenor, ""Passing Through""'s opening couplet of ""I was born to lose/ I won't have this form forever"" could scan as an occult-informed boast or a bleak statement of acceptance. And yet, that single <i>memento mori </i>soundbite embodies the strange optimism of the project as a whole: tucking into this album is kind of like taking a stroll through hell with a trusted friend.</p></div>"|19136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19136-horseback-piedmont-apocrypha/|7.4|Zoe Camp

<p>Mustard's sound peruses the common ground between the chunky low-end synths of seminal house hits like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps2Jc28tQrw&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robin S.’ “Show Me Love”</a> and the orchestral pomp of g-funk-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dre</a>. He and YG have worked closely on mixtapes such as 2012's <a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/16605/yg_dj_mustard_4_hunnid_degreez.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>4 Hunnid Degreez</i></a> and the <a href=""http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yg-just-re-d-up-hosted-by-dj-ill-will-and-dj-mustard-mixtape.13207.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Just Re’d Up</i></a> <a href=""http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yg-just-re-d-up-2-mixtape.73337.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">series</a>, forging a symbiotic producer-rapper bond the likes of which has scarcely been seen on a mainstream field of play since Drake and Noah ""40"" Shebib. YG’s major-label debut <i>My Krazy Life</i> marks a turning point for the duo; here, Mustard’s production and YG’s songwriting have both gone deliciously widescreen.</p>
<p>Mustard’s still working with the melodic economy that has drawn shrewd trend-watchers Drake, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Young Jeezy</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a> to his fold, but here they’re lighter and brighter. The opening fanfares on <i>My Krazy Life</i>'s tracks are gossamer but massive, like a blindside smack from a pillow. Typically, Mustard’s productions lay their wares out early and drive home simple hooks flanked by little else but 808 kicks and claps, occasionally throwing in a weird embellishment or nod to his forefathers. Strip club anthem “Left, Right” doubles down on its colossal three-note theme with a fiddle midway through each verse, “BPT”’s air raid siren keys are accented with orchestra hits like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qm8PH4xAss&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dre and 50 Cent’s “In Da Club”</a>, and “Do It to Ya” plunks out piano and Moog melodies on loan from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx9yypsIW_Q&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tha Dogg Pound’s “Let’s Play House”</a>.</p>
<p>But by and large, Mustard’s game is achieving ecstasy through simplicity and repetition, hooks and drums thundering through each measure with scarcely a note gone to waste. YG could’ve shit on a mic with Mustard as co-pilot and still turned out a halfway listenable hour of music, but to his instead he’s used <i>My Krazy Life</i> to play with the gun-toting lothario rubric he pieced together on the earlier mixtapes. The album is very much an exercise in genre (gangsta rap, natch) beholden to all the structural touchstones of a modern-day mainstream rap release, but this time YG’s classicist read on Southern California gang life comes with a refined flair for storytelling.</p>
<p>Stylistically, YG says he was aiming for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4102-snoop-dogg/"">Snoop Dogg</a>'s <i>Doggystyle</i><i></i>, and you can hear faint traces of that record on <i>My Krazy Life</i>, especially in the way that songs that touch on his background as a convicted residential burglar (“1AM”, “Meet the Flockers”) collide with decadent good life numbers like “I Just Wanna Party” and “Who Do You Love?” to paint a picture of a young gangster who works hard and plays harder. <i>My Krazy Life</i> periodically eases off its unsettlingly gleeful blueprinting of breaking-and-entering scenarios through YG’s ace hook construction and a selection of comical interstitial skits—and hang around for the deep cut “Really Be (Smokin N Drinkin)”, which pulls the listener inside the loss and desperation that provides the impetus for such extralegal escapades.</p>
<p><i>My Krazy Life</i> also finds YG flexing a greater comfort in regards to songs about women. It might be unreasonable to expect a guy who rose to fame on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWlMhiEL9Mc&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Toot It and Boot It”</a>, whose body of work is rife with vengeful pith like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK9w-MtcmK4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Bitch Betta Have My Money”</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjHhWdjWeDo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Youzza Flip”</a>, to care about his bedside manner—but he makes inroads. “Do It to Ya” is the requisite sex jam, but this time the focus is on reciprocity instead of conquest. “Me and My Bitch” chronicles the souring of a relationship after a girlfriend cheats, but he intimates that he still carries a torch for her when they slip into a nebulous friends with benefits arrangement after breaking up.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>My Krazy Life</i>’s most engaging relationship song is familial: “Sorry Momma” closes the album with an apology to YG’s mom for a laundry list of petty misdeeds and a pledge to do better by her now that he’s rich and she’s not doing so well. On a certain level, the softer touch of these songs ticks off the expected major label song-for-the-ladies pandering—they’re replete with syrupy hooks from ratch&amp;B crooners Ty Dolla $ign and TeeFlii—but they also reveal a songwriter who remains captivating even when he pushes his trademark tough guy posturing to the side.</p>
<p>From classic Compton set-repping rhymes, to guest spots from <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/topdawgent"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TDE</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30639-jay-rock/"">Jay Rock</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q/"">Schoolboy Q</a>, to production that boils g-funk down to its requisite elements, <i>My Krazy Life</i> breathes new energy into West Coast gangsta rap. YG holds summits with out-of-towners throughout, exchanging bars with Drake on “Who Do You Love?”, taking a beat from ATL maestro Metro Boomin for “1AM”, and celebrating friendship with Jeezy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a> on the platinum-selling buddy anthem “My Nigga”.</p>
<p>But this album’s sense of place and time isn’t amorphous and dependent on collaborators, as it's been with YG’s peers: <i>My Krazy Life </i>is always kicking back under roadside palm trees or darting through back alleys, shaking foes that give chase. It's a record that's always posted up in sunny SoCal, and whether it's serving up carefree party anthems or dispensing crass advice on whose houses to knock over and what to take, L.A. feels like the capital of the country when it’s playing. YG and DJ Mustard have been dress rehearsing for nationwide stardom all along, but <i>My Krazy Life</i> is ratchet music’s Technicolor reveal.</p></div>"|19164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19164-yg-my-krazy-life/|8.1|Craig Jenkins

The synthetic harp melody unfurls neatly, but the percussion beneath it scrambles and writhes, providing an antic locomotion. It's the same kind of aural illusion that Providence producer James Hinton cultivated on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18679-the-range-nonfiction/""><i>Nonfiction</i></a>, where he plumbed deep dynamics between soft, easy melodies and jagged, intricate drums, polished digital tones and crude stream-ripped samples.</p>
<p><i>Panasonic</i> adds six more satisfying variations to the bright, gently jostling terrain of that fine debut. There are a few callbacks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16086-the-range-metal-swing/"">""Metal Swing""</a>, a <i>Nonfiction</i> standout that combined zigzagging production and loose, low-res grime vocals. On ""Two"", piano tones and hats elevate homely rap refrains towards fervor; ""Ed Reed Jersey"" is built around a terse, skipping boast, and the hardness of the vocal is matched by deep, implacable bass and a blocky snare, but also tempered by a sweet swirl of melody that makes it gully music for sensitive souls.</p>
<p>On <i>Panasonic </i>opener ""Slow Build"", Hinton slowly alchemizes minimal techno into rugged hip-hop, looping R&amp;B refrains and rap posse chants through a purposefully limping bass line. With one exception—the supple, drilling ""Tricky Pose"" is almost straight-faced drum'n'bass—he continues to find rococo rhythmic seams between disparate substances. ""Sony"" is on-trend with its winsome chipmunk vocal samples but replaces the dubstep-lite backing that often accompanies them with steady, thick-piled synth pop, while ""Two"" approximates the sound of a classical piano trio before introducing a fleet, strafing rhythmic undercarriage. Hinton restrains his melodies to dewy loops and airy progressions, using plucked string and piano sounds to leave space for his pillowy basses and feathery drum programs. The music is always characterized by the sense of time coiling and swirling below smooth façades, but on <i>Panasonic</i>, The Range uses this technical heft to achieve surprisingly accessible and emotive results.</p></div>"|19125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19125-the-range-panasonic-ep/|7.4|Brian Howe

Two years later, <i>Rugby Thompson </i>emerged, taking some of the best sour-smoke soul beats of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31329-harry-fraud/"" target=""_blank"">Harry Fraud</a>'s production career and revealing DZA to be nicer with the concepts and storytelling abilities than his earlier straight-talk lyrics had hinted at. He still sounded like someone whose most memorable and individualistic traits on the mic put him at the level of a somewhat less oddball, more NYC-beholden version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>. But his strengths of grounded observation and a lack of out-and-out corniness outweighed the tendency for his lyrics to be less memorable than the beats he chose to spit them over.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>Dream.ZONE.Achieve</i> has a problem: it's roughly as long as <i>George Kush Da Button</i> and <i>Rugby Thompson</i> put together. For an MC whose lyrics don't typically allow much room for narrative scope, easygoing humor, or high-concept weirdness, that's a good way to make a sporadically inventive but otherwise passable-at-best album feel like a total slog. The easiest way to get a handle on where DZA is now and how far he needs to go to get in the conversation of best MCs out of New York is to get a load of ""Ghost of Dipset"", the album's second cut (third if you count the intro skit, which features—here's a hell of an omen —a pseudo-freestyle interrupted by a car wreck). The ghost in question appears in the form of a Cam'ron verse where, in a handful of bars, Cam meets, describes, reminisces over, worries about, is briefly tempted by, and then dismisses a longtime female acquaintance who wants to cheat on her husband with him. All that evocative detail follows two DZA verses that ricochet from comparing himself to ""Banksky"" [sic] to scattershot descriptions of his gear to a bloodless interpolation of Mobb Deep's ""Survival of the Fittest"". The goodwill amassed by each sharp line (""Broke hearts like when Ewing missed the finger roll"") is practically erased by a clunker soon after (""They call it showing love, nah, call it sucking dicks/Speaking of that, face fucking my Cambodian bitch"").</p>
<p>At least those are punchlines that make him sound like he tried. His voice is strong—think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Pusha T</a> with a little more snarl—his flow is usually fundamentally sound, and every so often he shows he's got a way with taut internal rhymes. But where <i>Dream.ZONE.Achieve</i> stalls out is in the inability for DZA to take his initial spark of lyrical inspiration and build from it into something more evocative. The scenarios and sentiments he lays out are credible, and there's little doubt that everything is said without pandering to an audience he doesn't truly connect with. But without a sustained attention-getting creativity, the themes of <i>Dream.ZONE.Achieve</i> largely blur together in a haze of aimless defiance and frustration. You've heard tracks like ""City of Dreams"" (NYC-repping anti-swag call to realness), ""9eleven"" (neighborhood as war zone), and ""Jigga Flow"" (pick any <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> deep cut) before—and DZA hasn't come around to finding a way to make these popular, often relatable, and frankly well-worn themes uniquely his own. Considering how often the spotlight swings to personality-rich guests like Ab-Soul (""Hearses""), Wiz Khalifa &amp; Curren$y (""Legends in the Making""), and BJ the Chicago Kid (""Robin Givens""), the contrast gets pretty stark.</p>
<p>Still, even DZA's detractors have to admit that the man can pick a production slate. Even if all you hear DZA as is the necessary vocal counterpart of a choice beat, there's a lot that demands to be heard. His ear for bleary yet attention-getting midtempo slow-burn noir soul is hard to compete with, and even if there's little here that tops the best moments from Ski Beatz or Harry Fraud on his previous releases, it's remarkably cohesive considering the dozen-plus names involved. Ski's late-night skulk of fusion-jazz soul (""Jigga Flow"") and a couple elegaic prog-trap beats from Fraud (""I Don't Know""; ""Legends in the Making"") frame DZA's voice well. And qualitatively, there's little separating up-and-comers like Cardo and vets like Sean C.</p>
<p>But the last track, and most promising pairing, actually winds up as some kind of weird paradox. ""Achieve,"" which marks the conclusion of the titular three-act arc of the album, is where DZA finally gets to fulfill a stated dream of rhyming over a Pete Rock beat. He does this for two pretty capable, enthusiastic-sounding minutes—and then spends another <i>seven</i> giving out dedications and shout-outs to the extent that it makes the coda of Jay-Z's ""My 1st Song"" sound like the concluding half a bar of ""Takeover"". In most other contexts, that'd be a waste. Here, it's one of the only looks we get into a world that's bigger than just DZA himself.</p></div>"|19078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19078-smoke-dza-dreamzoneachieve/|6.2|Nate Patrin

Her recent albums with Evangelista have been delivered with such abrasive, primal force and emotive intensity as to be genuinely intimidating for the unsuspecting listener.</p>
<p>So even though Bozulich proclaims her latest solo album, <i>Boy,</i> as her version of a “pop record,” a sense of perspective is important. It's true that <i>Boy</i> showcases a renewed focus on standard song construction and forward propulsion compared to such albums as Evangelista’s <i>Hello, Voyager</i> or <i>In Animal Tongue</i>, but there’s nothing here that's as immediate or pop-centered as Geraldine Fibbers at their most accessible; it's a safe bet to assume that the days of Bozulich performing relatively straight covers of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-R4UmSeDQU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dolly Parton</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83iZV4GKHug"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> songs are a thing of the past. But <i>Boy</i> is filled with memorable songs that are full-muscled enough to withstand whatever level of barbed deconstruction that Bozulich throws at them, making it her most approachable album in a while.</p>
<p>On Evangelista’s 2011 brooding <i>In Animal Tongue</i>, Bozulich followed one particular stream of inspiration all the way to its murky headwaters, as she and her collaborators created a dense sonic atmosphere that abandoned conventional rock textures almost entirely. Several tracks on that album eliminated rhythmic momentum altogether, so it comes as a mild relief when Bozulich immediately dispels any lingering sense of claustrophobia by kicking off <i>Boy</i> with ""Ain't No Grave"", proclaiming “Ain’t no grave that can hold me down” over a dramatic stab of bass and Andrea Belfi’s fluid drumming.    </p>
<p>As with Bozulich’s past work, <i>Boy</i> makes frequent reference to various country, gospel, and blues traditions, and those influences are refracted in ways that surprise and unsettle. Such slow-simmering tracks as “Don’t Follow Me” or the hypnotic “What Is It Baby” sound like distant relations to standard country or folk-blues songs, stretched and attenuated in a such a way that their punches never quite seem to land where you expect them.  <i>Boy</i>'s most straightforward song, “Lazy Crossbones”, features an electric piano shuffle and downright catchy “Ba-da-da-da” chorus competing for space with hazy interjections of feedback and abstract layers of tape noise. Bozulich’s earthy voice remains a unique and malleable instrument, and here she inhabits the shifting landscapes of her songs with authority and deceptive ease.</p>
<p>Bozulich’s vocals are so forceful and transfixing, in fact, that it's easy to overlook her skill as an arranger and sound artist. Playing the majority of the instruments herself, Bozulich specializes in creating combinations of sounds and textures that continually loosen the songs' moorings. The Tom Waits-like grind of the lusty “One Hard Man” is punctuated by vivid blasts of industrial noise, while distant strings echo through “Drowned to the Light” like fading spirits. At her best, Bozulich uses the vernacular song forms of country, blues, and yes, even “pop”, to tap into something that feels much more elemental, a vein of primitive emotion that feels like it could pre-date the notion of musical genres entirely. Her work on <i>Boy</i> should be sufficient to satisfy her longtime followers and perhaps draw some new onlookers into the fold.</p></div>"|19167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19167-carla-bozulich-boy/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

Less than a year after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44318-kim-gordon-thurston-moore-separate/"" target=""_blank"">news of his split</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1763-kim-gordon/"" target=""_blank"">Kim Gordon</a> (and the concomitant break-up of Sonic Youth) surfaced, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"" target=""_blank"">Thurston Moore</a> joined Twilight, an amorphous pan-American supergroup that had previously collected metalhead lifers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5778-leviathan/"" target=""_blank"">Leviathan</a>’s Wrest, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5803-nachtmystium/"" target=""_blank"">Nachtmystium</a>’s Blake Judd, and Krieg’s irascible leader Neill Jameson. Xasthur’s Malefic and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a>’ Aaron Turner had recorded with Twilight, too. Moore wasn’t a stranger to black metal, of course—he’d written about it in <i>Arthur</i>, professed his rather nascent love for its hate to <i>Decibel</i>, and had generally been part of the caustic form’s larger cultural uptick. His own vision of noise and volume had an undeniable impact on the evolution of heaviness during the last two decades, evidenced simply by his admission into the band itself. Still, it was hard not to feel a little embarrassed for the 55-year-old, in the same way you might grin but worry when a newly single parent admits they’ve squandered a chunk of retirement change on a candy-apple sports car. An indie rock icon prepared for his corpsepaint makeover.</p>
<p>Moore’s personal crisis wasn’t Twilight’s only moment of ignominy, either: In 2011, Jef Whitehead, or Wrest, had been charged with sexual assault and he was eventually <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1072852/leviathans-jef-whitehead-sentenced-to-two-years-probation/news/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">convicted</a> of aggravated domestic battery and sentenced to two years of probation. Though Judd doesn’t play on <i>Beneath Trident’s Tomb</i>, he did appear in <a href=""http://www.metal-observer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/twilight-band-2013-570x335.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">band photos </a>with Moore after he <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/thurston-moore-playing-black-metal-supergroup-twilights-new-album/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">broke the news</a> of the guitarist’s inclusion. In the past year, he’s been accused of <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1515721/how-nachtmystiums-blake-judd-betrayed-the-black-metal-community-and-wound-up-in-jail/news/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ripping off</a> fans and bandmates, <a href=""http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nachtmystium-mainman-arrested-on-theft-charges/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">arrested for theft</a>, and ultimately revealed that he was <a href=""http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nachtmystiums-blake-judd-says-that-he-is-getting-treatment-for-substance-abuse-issues/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">retreating the scene</a> with hopes of beating his substance-abuse problems. What’s more, when the group finally announced its long-delayed third album, it added a seemingly inevitable asterisk: <i>III: Beneath Trident’s Tomb </i>would be Twilight’s final album, because, effective immediately, the band was finished. If it was drama and excitement Moore sought, he had doubtlessly found it.</p>
<p>This tale of turmoil could go two ways for <i>Beneath Trident’s Tomb</i>, of course. It might provide an obstacle for Twilight to overcome, adding a core of tension and urgency to their process. Twilight could create its own pre-emptive <i>Behind the Music</i> and counter with their most wrenching album to date. Or the fuss could simply become the ballyhoo before the album’s eventual bust. Really, these six songs offer a little of both: The collective scrapes through a mess of black metal and sludge, industrial accents and noise countercurrents, post-punk switchbacks and atmospheric interludes. The music itself can be delightfully dense, with Moore and the Atlas Moth vocalist/guitarist Stavros Giannopoulos providing layer upon layer of leading riffs and antagonistic din. Moore plays the part of noise addendum perfectly, adding thin layers of dissonance and quick flashes of power when needed. Chicago producer Sanford Parker again adds electronic disarray, retrenching the album’s pronounced industrial direction.</p>
<p>Given the band’s new mass of guitars, they’re able to ratchet volume and intensity constantly. On “Seek No Shelter Fevered Ones”, for instance, they add an additional damaged layer of vocals or sub-surface shot of feedback at seemingly every turnaround. That same strength-in-numbers strategy works for the album’s best song, “Oh Wretched Son”. Twilight pinball from ghoulish lurch to bass-led sludge, from claustrophobic black metal to hardcore upheaval in a matter of minutes. They render each part with the precision of a veteran squad <i>and</i> the energy of five players enthusiastically building a collective musical map. They’re questioning in real-time what this version of Twilight is, and they’re answering rather loudly.</p>
<p>But that is the exception to <i>Tomb</i>’s blasé rule.<i> </i>Most of these songs suffer from a lack of motion or a mere inability to edit the excess away from that motion. Opener “Lungs” certainly sounds mean, but it lashes at the same theme at the same tempo for most of its four-minute runtime. It’s hard not to stare at the track time in anticipation of any change. As though acknowledging the tedium, Twilight does speed up for a short-lived coda, but even that feels like an afterthought, a footnote of excitement meant to mask general ennui. “Swarming Funereal Mass” is a tormented mid-tempo march, its doleful plod accented by drum machines and desperate vocals. There’s a riveting break toward the middle, where a gale of guitar noise overruns everything and seems to send even the band into shivers. But they soon drift into the same rote clip, extending one idea unnecessarily. That’s even true of the otherwise powerful “Seek No Shelter for the Fevered Ones”. At nine minutes, it’s impossibly bloated, a track whose placid introduction, steady buildup, and squall-infested midsection could have been condensed into a harrowing four minutes. As is, though, you’ll get too accustomed to the attack to be scared by it; Twilight’s apparent need to turn every little thought into very grand statements fosters a kind of sensory acclimation, where you become so used to the maneuvers they fail to leave any lasting effect.</p>
<p>Taken collectively, Twilight’s three finished albums feel like a decision still waiting to be made: What did this band hope to accomplish musically, other than to corral a handful of scene celebrities into a room every few years? Was their heart with the primal roar of their self-titled debut, a blunderbuss of invective and torment? Or was their head with <i>Monument to Time End</i>, a sophisticated sophomore album that seemed to take the talents of its members and apply them to more audacious structures than ever before? Given some refinement, that approach could have made Twilight incredible, a supergroup worth the noise that surrounds them. More than anything, <i>Beneath Trident’s Tomb </i>seems like an attempt to avoid any such stepwise intentionality, choosing instead to let a few aging dudes throw a fit in a recording studio behind a small set of underdeveloped songs. <i>Beneath Trident’s Tomb</i> shows flashes of brilliance. But those limited sparks add up to a disappointing final bow from a band whose sordid reputation and fable-like storyline will likely outlast the music it made. </p>

Herring has an energy, a physical aura, that moves along a single line. On one end is a hangdog character with tucked-in shirt and pleated khakis and on the other is an ursine man-monster wresting primordial sounds from his heart. Until recently, we could find Herring only in the small clubs where Future Islands relentlessly toured. With Herring as ringleader, these shows got pretty rowdy for a three-piece synth pop band. Everyone would push around to his metal vocals of “Tin Man” and sway along to <a href=""http://vimeo.com/52567362"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Inch of Dust”</a> — their former marquee song from 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14177-in-evening-air/""><i>In Evening Air</i></a> — all while Herring waved his arms like a man conducting a symphony of giants.</p>
<p>When Future Islands recently performed their <i>new</i> marquee song on “Letterman”, the stunning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54194-watch-future-islands-a-dream-of-you-and-me-video-seasons-performance-on-letterman/"">“Seasons (Waiting On You)”</a>, the secret was out: Here’s this guy, this dude with a tucked-in shirt, khakis, and a receding hairline bobbing and weaving, grinding gears in his throat, giving a “fuck yeah” gesture before a perfect pop modulation takes him to the chorus. He had that kind of uninhibited spirit the internet loves to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54254-david-letterman-trying-to-turn-future-islands-samuel-t-herrings-dance-moves-into-a-meme/"">protect and preserve</a>. If he had a more garrulous social media brand, no doubt he could take this moment and amass an army of fans, the hashtag Herring Task Force, retweeting Vines of people wearing tucked-in shirts and khakis doing “The Herring”.</p>
<p>The landmark performance was far and away the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/TheLateShow/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0&amp;sort=p"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most viewed musical segment on “Late Show With David Letterman”</a> and it was certainly the most surprising moment of Future Islands’ career. And now, following the storied live shows, the memes, and their move from Thrill Jockey to 4AD comes their fourth and possibly best album, <i>Singles</i>. These songs finally invite us to participate in Herring’s world, one shaped by geological heartbreak events and their epochal reflection periods, told with nothing more than the simple truth. It’s pop music distilled, something Future Islands have been working at since their earliest lo-fi electro-punk recordings.</p>
<p><i>Singles</i> is a great balance of pop and melodrama. It’s built around the sturdy new wave beat, almost always four on the floor, giving Herring a comfortable frame in which to sing. Its themes are also symmetrical, as Herring plays with antithesis like an eager English student: day and night, sun and moon, summer and winter, man and woman. His words are the sort of thing that would tumble out of your mouth if you were told to write a love poem right now in eight seconds. “She looks like the moon/ So close and yet so far” or “My sun every morning/ My star of the evening” are just two couplets that look goopy on the page but sound so impulsively romantic when he sings them. Which is to say that the setting for these songs is nothing fancy, but if they were any busier than cool nights in the tall grass with the moon hanging just so, it would ruin the music’s delicate relationship with Herring.</p>
<p>Herring’s presence draws from Wham City’s theatrical charm, but Future Islands also work on a much grander scale. From their debut up to 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15903-future-islands-on-the-water/""><i>On The Water</i></a>, bassist William Cashion was the group’s Peter Hook, as he offered distinctive lines with an actual personality behind it. But on <i>Singles</i>, Cashion and the band nod toward the stadium-ready anthems of early U2. The moody synth drones have been replaced with ergonomic melody and the band has tightened up accordingly. On songs like “Spirit” and the parting words of “A Dream Of You And Me”, when Herring’s passionate delivery carries him into those heavenly choruses, you can all but see the flood lights flash in the arena when he gets there. He sings with his eyes open, still searching, still trying to reconcile love, and still a little pissed off.</p>
<p>The album isn’t as taut as it could be in the back half—“Like the Moon”, for example, is a predictable and rather long four-and-a-half minutes. But Future Islands compensate for the occasional dull patch. Just after “Like the Moon” comes the album’s highpoint, the post-mortem ballad “Fall From Grace”. It could be a Beach House song with its below-freezing tempo and a spotlight on Cashion’s guitars, but then Herring gets to thinking about one of those heartbreak events and it all comes rushing back above this overdriven baritone guitar. He unknots all the emotion that has only bubbled up until now and asks one last question about their love and basically Hulks out: “was it ALL INSIDE OF ME?” The moment is arresting, and in the context of the sometimes mushy poetry of the album, these four words are blinding and absolutely unforgettable.</p>
<p>If this all seems <i>a bit much</i>, well, it is. That’s the point of Future Islands, to invite this impulsive and unfettered behavior into the lives of listeners, both at home and at their shows. <i>Singles</i> is risky, but the strength of the songwriting carries it over. It reminds me of that video from Sasquatch 2009 of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8z7f7a2Pk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shirtless guy dancing to Santigold</a>, which has since gone mega viral.

It is an object singular enough in music history that the Country Music Hall of Fame officially recognized it in 1999. Patrick Haggerty, the man who wrote and recorded it, was raised on a dairy farm outside Seattle by a loving and accepting family before the twin shocks of the Stonewall riots and his ejection from the Peace Corps radicalized him. He responded with <i>Lavender Country</i>, pressing about 1,000 copies with the help of a local gay community organization and selling them by word-of-mouth and in the back pages of gay magazines. Once those were gone, that was more or less it—Haggerty remained a staunch advocate of gay rights, and performed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32084-lavender-country/"" target=""_blank"">Lavender Country</a> songs at pride events and community centers. But his record receded into history, to a rumor perfuming the edges of record collector conversation.</p>
<p>Now that the resourceful and adventurous North Carolina label Paradise of Bachelors is reissuing <i>Lavender Country</i>, the enduring richness of Haggerty's achievement can be appreciated again. Haggerty didn't just write a ""gay country album"" for the political theatre. There are winking lyrics about tumbling in the hay and a rewrite of ""Back in the Saddle Again"" as ""Back in the Closet Again"", but the country signifiers aren't just cheap hay-bale-and-tractor-bed props for a message. From the inexpertly sawed fiddle of Eve Morris to Michael Carr's saloon piano to Haggerty's reedy, searching tenor, it is a country album through and through. The sound is wobbly and amateurish, but in a playful, ""come on y'all"" sort of way, and you can easily imagine a roomful of enthusiastic participants in folding chairs at a community-center basement, singing along at Haggerty's encouragement.</p>
<p>Like any good culture-clash project, Lavender Country stops to have fun with sly subtext. ""There's milk and honey flowin' when you're blowin' Gabriel's horn"", Haggerty leers on ""Come Out Singing"". On the title track, he envisions a utopia where you wear your ""frilly blouse"" to ""The People's Outhouse"" and ""the folks will hang around and pee for days."" ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16633-cryin-these-cocksucking-tears/"" target=""_blank"">Cryin' These Cocksucking Tears</a>"" claimed the FCC license of a DJ brave or foolhardy enough to play it on the air. On it, Haggerty's backup vocalist Morris sings the words ""cock-sucking tears"" with a clarion earnestness, like Joan Baez working blue. It is a fresh joy to hear every time it comes along.</p>
<p>But Lavender Country is not a really a ""funny"" album. The songs address life inside the gay-rights struggle, and the specifics hurt. On ""Waltzing Will Trilogy"", Haggerty rails against the ""pack of straight white honky quacks"" administering shock treatment to homosexuals—""they call it mental hygiene but I call it psychic rape,"" he barks. Young men are beaten to death by police and sodomized by prison guards. ""Back in the Closet"" and ""Straight White Patterns"" detail the quiet torture of living within a straight white regime. And ""I Can't Shake The Stranger Out of You"" is a lovelorn take on gay cruising, a pickup song that doubles as a lament. ""I reckon you're lookin for some neckin, yes I do,"" Haggerty sings, inviting the song's subject to ""climb right up on into my manger, but let me warn you about one small danger, babe/ I can't shake the stranger out of you."" The song's tone is masterful—sexy, sad, and tender all at once.</p>
<p>This is why, despite the references to the struggles of the era, Lavender Country never feels like a footnote, historical or otherwise. Haggerty's songs  are resonant and wonderful, folding pain into jokes and vice versa and exuding heartbreak and anger and wry good humor. You could never switch the gender pronouns on a song like ""Georgie Pie"", where Haggerty beseeches a would-be lover who remains closeted, and yet the song speaks to anyone who has ever felt the sting of a rebuke. Haggerty's playfully frank ""Your body odor lingers in my toes and in my nose and in my head"" on ""Come Out Singing"" will make you grin with recognition if you've ever picked up and smelled someone's t-shirt.</p>
<p>Haggerty kept moving after Lavender Country, running for local office twice and working in anti-police brutality and anti-apartheid movements. He is 70 years old now, and often plays to senior centers (he mostly sticks to Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn). <i>Lavender Country</i> is a piece of his past, one moment in a busy life spent in social justice. But, any way it is viewed, it's a tremendous feat, a remarkable act of bravery and honesty as well as a statement on the universality of love and lust and belonging. Pop songs are limited vessels for social justice, but the good ones do a remarkable job of teaching empathy, a few minutes at a time, and Haggerty's songs build a better world to live in, for forty minutes or so. There aren't many achievements more exalted than that. </p></div>"|19088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19088-lavender-country-lavender-country/|8.6|Jayson Greene

<p><i>Two</i> does sound like a natural progression <i></i>for the project—“Four Works of Art…” is almost raga-like in its call-and-response drone, not too dissimilar from <i>Owls</i>' opener “What Whorse You Wrote Id On”—but this is not a case of Owls picking up where they left off. Tim Kinsella actually <i>hits</i> notes (even the high ones) and, yes, the unwieldy song titles of <i>Owls </i>have been ditched as well. Mike Kinsella’s drumming is intuitive and fluid rather than fractured, which allows bassist Sam Zurick to actually groove rather than forcing himself within the gnarled arpeggios of guitarist Victor Villareal. A colleague mentioned <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"">Real Estate</a> upon hearing <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/polyvinyl-records/owls-ancient-stars-seed-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Ancient Stars Seed…”</a>, and there are parts of <i>Two</i> that qualify as “indie rock”—the amiable amble of “The Lion…”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16487-im-surprised/"">“I’m Surprised…”</a> righting itself into a genuine chorus. Whereas <i>Owls</i> required the kind of sweep-picking mastery outlined in Guitar World columns, a beginner could play some of these songs on guitar.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Owls</i>—or almost anything that Tim Kinsella has been involved with—<i>Two</i> doesn’t need a preemptive warning about its “challenging” nature, which might disappoint diehards who relish the challenge. <i>Two</i> lacks the explosive, uncanny chemistry of <i>Owls</i>—nothing matches the unbridled exuberance of “Everyone Is My Friend”, the fragile beauty of “Anyone Can Have A Good Time”, the frisky rhythmic interplay of “I Want the Quiet Moments of a Party Girl”, and there's not a lyric that hits as squarely as “It’s not impossible to think of you thinking of me.” <i>Two</i> sounds comparatively normalized, both due to Owls’ own aesthetic softening and the dozens of bands who have co-opted this sound wholesale. It doesn't clearly demonstrate why people follow Kinsella’s every whim, or why he spent nearly two decades being despised.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Two</i> is a showcase for Kinsella as a frontman rather than a bandleader. He’s always been a tough sell, even from the days of the relatively revered-by-consensus Cap’n Jazz, but if you tried to engage with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2197-joan-of-arc/"">Joan of Arc</a> album titles like <i>In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust</i> (let alone the contents therein) and immediately determined, “Yeah, this isn’t for me,” no one would blame you. But in the past few years, he’s found rejuvenation in old age similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek"">Mark Kozelek</a>: simultaneously emboldened and embittered by a life in music and a resultant, unflappable fanbase, they’ve pretty much stopped caring about public perception, which has resulted in some of their most honest and direct music.</p>
<p><i>Two</i> is filled with dozens of obtuse word jumbles that only make sense to Tim Kinsella and others that only make sense if you live in Chicago, but there's also very private thoughts that cloak their own profundity. <i>Two</i> can variously scan as a sly critique of internet culture, or aging within the indie rock community, or just aging in general as an artist of limited earning potential. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16724-owls-why-oh-why/"">“Why Oh Why…”</a>, Kinsella casually doles a withering dismissal of thinkpiece culture: “It’s cute how you assume your experience of the world is the world.” But as a cult artist, he understands the appeal of that cloistered mindset: “Haven’t you ever been new somewhere?/ Haven’t you been envious of membership’s endlessness?”</p>
<p><i>Two</i> practically demands listening along with the lyrics sheet; this is high-concept, cerebral stuff that's difficult to wrench any kind of visceral thrill from. Opener “Four Works of Art…” is an ingeniously crafted song both musically and lyrically, but it lays out “A way of understanding this historical period” by letting you consider the commonalities between a car filled with trash, Christopher Kubasik, David Petraeus, and a CCR tape—and yet it all rattles around your head in a way that’s more unsettling than the prodding done by Owls’ progeny. Even though Owls serve as a touchstone in 2014, there's still little that quite sounds like <i>Two</i>.</p></div>"|19135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19135-owls-two/|7.3|Ian Cohen

We’re used to the kind of power-pop he makes abiding by certain rules and forms—three chords, three minutes, a chorus that repeats enough times for first-time listeners to be singing along by the end—but the songs on <i>Dissed and Dismissed</i> slyly toy with expectations. Take “Nowhere to Go”, the crunching slacker anthem that opens the album: Two sing-songy verses followed by a harmonized, Thin Lizzy-esque solo that feels like a build-up to something… but actually just turns out to be a finale. Most of the songs (which range from 26 seconds to an epic minute-and-a-half) on the album proceed similarly. And yet, somehow, ”album” is the right word here. <i>Dissed and Dismissed</i> is more fully realized—and packs more of a punch—than plenty of records five times its length. Call it a half-a-half-hour of power.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Molina’s been a staple in the San Francisco hardcore scene for years now—he’s played in the bands Ovens, Caged Animal, Dystrophy, and Lifetime Problems, to name a few—but his solo work lets his sharp pop instincts shine. Initially released in early 2013 as a tape on the small Bay Area label <a href=""http://melters.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melters</a>, <i>Dissed and Dismissed</i> became an instant cult favorite, quickly selling out its first pressing. (Later in the year, he also released the taut, self-explanatory <i>Six Tracks E.P.</i> as a part of Matador’s <a href=""http://matablog.matadorrecords.com/2013/08/29/singles-going-home-alone-update-a-our-subscription-series-is-totally-awesome-b-why-havent-you-signed-up-yet/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Singles Going Home Alone Series</span></a>.) Now, to bide the time while he records a new full-length for Slumberland and in hopes of reaching a larger audience, the label has reissued <i>Dissed and Dismissed</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Molina’s music combines <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2456-ted-leo-and-the-pharmacists/"" target=""_blank"">Ted Leo</a>’s taste in riffs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5558-rivers-cuomo/"" target=""_blank"">Rivers Cuomo</a>’s record collection circa “In the Garage”, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Pollard</a>’s attention span. In one of its most subdued moments, <i>Dissed and Dismissed</i> includes an acoustic cover of the early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided By Voices</a> song “Wandering Boy Poet”, and it feels like an obvious nod to the kindred spirits who believe that a song that exceeds two minutes has long overstayed its welcome. There’s a crucial difference in the ethos of these artists, though. The brevity of early Guided By Voices tracks conveyed a certain shrug, Pollard’s demeanor always seeming to say, “I got bored with this one before I could write an ending or mix it properly.” Brief as they are, though, every one of Molina’s songs sounds <i>finished</i>—these are complete thoughts. The melancholy “Can’t Believe” moves through a whole sunset of tonal hues; it’s the shortest song<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4181-teenage-fanclub/""> Teenage Fanclub</a> never wrote. Another highlight, “Don’t Come Back”, begins as a pop-punk song, ramps up to a bubblegum-hardcore breakdown, and then ends in a blaze of of signal flare riffage. It works because it’s confident, polished, and deftly executed—not in spite of any of these facts. Combining near-comic concision and hi-fi production lets Molina have the best of both worlds: These songs have a slacker sensibility, but they’re not afraid of occasional brushes with virtuosity.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-81056674-f40e-be28-983e-27a36d6436a2""><i>Dissed and Dismissed</i><span> ends just before it starts to feel formulaic.

Before Macklemore was the poster boy for mainstream rap’s <a href=""INK%20%22http://grantland.com/features/rap-and-the-influence-of-other-genres/"" target=""_blank"">identity crisis</a>, he was just another inoffensive, independent rapper, with a facile flow, a pleasant attitude and a real love for the genre of music he had chosen to work within. But give the guy a couple of catchy beats and suddenly he’s sprung to life as the vanilla oppressor of rap’s traditionalists, too approachable by half and more than willing to lecture hip-hop on everything it’s doing wrong. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Those irritated by Macklemore will probably not think any better of his fellow Seattle resident <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29821-grieves/"" target=""_blank"">Grieves</a>, the cosmetic similarities between the two former collaborators actually doing a disservice to the former’s skills as a rapper. Both artists do share a jones for sentimental subject matter, rhyming with a down-to-earth demeanor that can border on self-congratulatory. Grieves, born Benjamin Laub, also sings his own hooks, and the piano-heavy beats he’s particular to place him somewhere between Slug and Jason Mraz on the musical spectrum.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Winter and the Wolves </i>is Grieves’ fourth album, promoted, like a kind of musical companion to the Liam Neeson movie <i>The Gray, </i>as being<i> </i>“about the instinctual fight for survival.” That struggle mostly makes itself known through reflective songs about the rapper’s life, including a batch concerned with the events of childhood and a now-defunct relationship. Laub is an intensely honest songwriter and the album is shot through with raw emotion, even when the subject in question seems innocuous. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Grieves has a gift for melody and his best songs rise above their subject matter with catchy hooks and amiable, keyboard and guitar-laden production courtesy of San Jose’s B. Lewis.  “Astronauts"", a song about the losses that come with maturity, has a very sticky chorus. “Kidding Me"", while it has many of the self-pitying qualities that hurt Laub’s songs about relationships, has a soulful beat and a syrupy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28044-mayer-hawthorne/"" target=""_blank"">Mayer Hawthorne</a>-esque hook.  But both songs are plagued by the unshakeable self-importance that dogs the record, with lines like “you don’t have to be a kid to believe or see potential in a pile of leaves.” There’s no doubt that Grieves believes in the things that he’s rapping about; the problem is that he doesn’t seem to have any kind of self-awareness or sense of humor in doing so.</p>
<p class=""p1"">What is it about earnestness that can seem so irksome? To start, in a genre built on coded language and slang, the relative approachability of Grieves’ music feels facile, his lyrics and production simple in a genre that has historically prized complexity.  Add that to the fact that Grieves is a passable technical rapper, rather than a particularly compelling one, prone to rattling off lines like “I’ve been a bad seed ever since the ovaries” and you’re not left with much to sink your teeth into. The album is straightforward, but often so much so that it can seem as if there’s nothing below the surface.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Grieves can be tough to bear when he’s cheerful, but he’s far worse when upset.  The break-up song “Over You” is the prototypical lament of the <a href=""http://feminspire.com/nice-guy-syndrome-and-the-friend-zone/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nice guy done wrong</a>. I couldn’t help but compare the song to Fiona Apple’s “Werewolf"", a track that also uses a series of metaphors to explore a break-up; each comparison Apple makes seems representative of the actual complexity of a real relationship. By contrast, Laub’s most interesting move is the final line, “I just don’t know how to get over you,” presented like a Shyamalan twist, as if we weren’t expected to recognize the bitterness that the song is basted in.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">The blandness of the subject matter with which Grieves works makes his songs broadly relatable: it’s easy to imagine listeners identifying with the feelings he expresses on <i>Winter and the Wolves, </i>especially given that a large percentage of the songs are legitimately catchy<i>. </i>Rap like this has always existed and, again, it's largely inoffensive—but when it becomes popular, it threatens to dislodge more complicated music. Macklemore’s success sets a precedent: it will not be shocking if one of Grieves’ new songs makes it to radio playlists. Hip-hop has traditionally been a forward-thinking space, where either lyricists or producers can explore difficult musical territory. The success of music that does not make use of the genre in this way, threatens rap’s progressive identity above anything else.</p></div>"|19157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19157-grieves-winter-the-wolves/|4.7|Jonah Bromwich

Since arriving in 2001 as inside operatives bent on dance-punk’s destruction, their career has alternated bizarre and divisive left turns with records that vindicated their artistic vision. This risk/reward dynamic is even more pronounced with the release of their seventh album, <i>Mess</i>. The sleek contours of 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16681-wixiw/""><i>WIXIW</i></a> betrayed Liars’ self-admission that they were learning how to use computers and sequencers on the fly, downplaying the extreme shift from the caveman garage rock and scabrous art-punk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10588-liars/""><i>Liars</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13991-sisterworld/""><i>Sisterworld</i></a>. And now <i>Mess</i> feels like Liars getting their driver’s license after fumbling with a learner’s permit—you can have a lot more fun with this machinery once you stop worrying about totaling the thing.  </p>
<p>If you didn’t care for <i>WIXIW</i>’s muted introspection, <i>Mess</i> is a welcome counterpoint; the dance-punk throwback “Brats” was tacked onto <i>WIXIW</i> seemingly as a random addendum, but Liars have a way of using late-album cuts as foreshadowing. And in fact <i>Mess</i> is the first Liars album that could be given a “dance-” hyphenate since their debut. As with <i>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top</i>, it’s physical, bodymoving music for people who don’t have much interest in proper dance music. A pitch-shifted Angus Andrew begins <i>Mess</i> demanding to be depantsed (as well as “eat my socks”), and after the pummeling beat of “Mask Maker” drops, it could be heard as an alternate history, one in which Liars continued on the path of electroclash subversives.</p>
<p>Liars have never been futurists, and a curious byproduct of their electronic shift is how it’s made them strangely retro. Their previous record’s clicks and whirs hearkened back to early 2000s IDM and lap-pop such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3067-the-notwist"">the Notwist</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1121-dntel"">Dntel</a>, where the first half of <i>Mess</i> takes its cues from the festival-EDM that was thoroughly trendpieced around the time of <i>WIXIW</i>—Hoovering bass, crowd-pleasing drops, air raid synth lines. <i>Mess</i> bangs from the start, albeit in a way that tends to flatten out the dynamics, as the introductory duo of “Mask Masker” and “Vox Tuned D.E.D.” could be mistaken for an eight-minute suite, a fairly predictable means of expressing their past physicality in an electronic setting. The relatively quieter moments are where Liars show their newfound confidence and instrumental facility: an organ break reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast"">OutKast</a>’s <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCsQyCkwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEAgfrE28gpc%26feature%3Dkp&amp;ei=lMQkU8evGoS8oQTz-YCYBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlplhvTfTdOdFsUu7mUqVYT4oq7Q&amp;sig2=au4UBgxLWF78mpApVeiK2g&amp;bvm=bv.62922401,d.cGU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Ghettomusick”</a> pierces through “Pro Anti Anti”, while the frazzled, free-time “Can’t Hear Well” hints towards the second half’s turn towards more abstract composition.</p>
<p><i>Mess</i> turns out to be an admirably diverse album that foregrounds the big-beat material: “Darkslide” and “Boyzone” find Liars imposing their will on electronic music rather than the other way around, the tribal rhythms and perverted vocals of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4767-drums-not-dead/""><i>Drum’s Not Dead</i></a> updated with fancier software. The closers “Perpetual Village” and “Left Speaker Blown” actually revisit the unsettling atmosphere of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4765-they-were-wrong-so-we-drowned/""><i>They Were Wrong So We Drowned</i></a> and contain some of Andrew’s most evocative lyrics if you can manage to suss them out. But at a combined 16 minutes of slow-moving murk and half-illegible, half-inaudible vocals, they’re more exciting as clues towards speculating Liars’ next move than they are in the present moment.</p>
<p>Which at least cuts against the narrative that <i>Mess</i> is a fully-realized mission statement; Andrew confessed to being riddled with spiritual and artistic doubt throughout <i>WIXIW</i>, but <i>Mess</i> is far more dilettantish and can register as being every bit as cynical as the murderous, anti-Los Angeles screed <i>Sisterworld</i>. At points, Andrew confesses “I am old/ Endless monotony dulls all alternatives/ Life is long, way too long” and “I heard the wild world is wicked/ And the modern one is out for blood.”</p>
<p>Seven albums in, the respectable qualities of Liars’ music have been well-documented, but it’s worth asking: do they make moving, ingratiating music or simply admirable art? Does anything on <i>Mess</i> have the capacity to inspire emotional investment?  Does any of it stick with you? Or, more importantly, where is the <i>Liars</i>-ness in <i>Mess</i>? Mostly, it comes from Andrew’s voice, still intimidating in its lowest registers and frightening when given to wraith-like moans; we get both modes during obvious highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16513-liars-mess-on-a-mission/"">“Mess On a Mission”</a>.  But it’s been 10 years since Liars were notoriously and short-sightedly called “unlistenable” by major publications. In 2014, <i>Mess</i> might be called ""challenging"" out of habit, but is anything here capable of scaring off the squares?</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Mess</i> can sound pretty tame compared to electronic acts which can be linked to their ultra-percussive, post-punk aesthetics such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor"">Factory Floor</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5684-fuck-buttons/"">Fuck Buttons</a>. As enjoyable as it can be, <i>Mess</i> is a centrist record from a band without a lot of centrist strengths and appreciating it can feel like a symbolic gesture: it’s easy to support a band who’s achieved their level of success while making conceivably challenging music. In other words, it’s easy to admire because Liars are easy to admire.</p></div>"|19121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19121-liars-mess/|6.9|Ian Cohen

This, however, would be a fundamental misunderstanding of the Baton Rouge rapper. Although his unflinching, often brutal dope-boy tales can find him struggling against his naturally pessimistic impulses, Gates' default mode is one of squinty-eyed suspicion, and the world he inhabits in his music is one where human connection only leads to betrayal and trust is something that gets you killed. But even with his Atlantic debut looming somewhere on the horizon and a higher profile than he's ever enjoyed, Gates sounds unsatisfied and more than a little paranoid on <i>By Any Means</i>, his third release in just over a year.</p>
<p>This isn't to say his latest project—or Gates's music in general—is a bummer. As with his previous two releases, <i>By Any Means</i> is packed with uptempo anthems and chest-pumping bravado, the only difference being that here the beats are both a little bigger and have more of a sheen to them. The album splits the difference between the radio-friendly melodicism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17808-kevin-gates-the-luca-brasi-story/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Luca Brasi Story</i></a> and the technical experimentation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18336-kevin-gates-stranger-than-fiction/"" target=""_blank""><i>Stranger Than Fiction</i></a>, inching closer to the mainstream rap radio that one imagines is Gates' ultimate goal. The production still prioritizes the kind of lower frequencies that could level buildings, and it's not afraid to take the sounds usually found at the fringes of trap beats and make them the focus. Whether it's the cathedral organs of ""Arm and Hammer"" courtesy of the Runners and the Monarch or the eerie MIDI blues backdrop that Dun Deal provides for bitter kiss-off ""Stop Lyin'"", Gates tends to select tracks just to the left of the kind of beats other rappers would typically choose from the same producers, and it gives his music the advantage of sounding familiar but fresh at the same time.</p>
<p>That said, Gates could rap over boilerplate trap beats and he'd still manage to put his personal spin on them. Few rappers today as using their voices as well as Gates does; he's got an instinctive grasp on when to slip from his usual melodic cadence into a balled-fist croak that sounds like he took a cheese grater to his vocal chords. He pulls out this trick on ""Homicide"", a harrowing tale in which he exacts revenge after a botched job leaves his friend murdered and Gates in the hospital.</p>
<p>Gates' ability to say one thing with his lyrics and another with his voice has always been one of his greatest strengths. He can puff his chest out while simultaneously undercutting a boast, and this works especially well on an album that finds him ostensibly closer to his goals but somehow even more paranoid and isolated, caught somewhere between sheer disbelief that he's even made it this far (""Can't Make This Up"") and an overwhelming suspicion it's too good to be true, especially for someone who knows himself well enough to know that the man he used to be is always lurking around the corner. ""Be cool, you must want to see me incarcerated"" he raps on ""Keep Fucking With Me"", but over the course of <i>By Any Means</i>, you get the feeling that Gates' is as worried about his own self-destructive tendencies as he is any external forces out to get him. With the exception of ""Movie"", an absolutely heartwarming account of the birth of his children, Gates rarely sounds as if he's enjoying his recent success, even while boasting about driving around in cars he once only saw on the big screen; you can tell he's trying, but relaxing is still foreign to someone like him.</p>
<p>On the flip side of ""Movie"" is ""Posed to Be in Love"", in which Gates narrates beating his girlfriend after discovering that she cheated on him while he was in prison. At best, the track can be viewed as an ""All of the Lights""-style exploration of male rage and domestic violence; at worst, it comes across like a frightening glimpse into Gates' misogynist attitude towards women, which has reared its head before but never as brazenly as it does here. It's the kind of track that makes it obvious that an Atlantic sign-off wasn't required, as it's the kind of song they'd be terrified that an artist of theirs—one who sells himself as much the lothario as he does the hustler—was recording. Then again, Gates has never been one shy away from exposing the worst parts of his psyche, even if it's as disturbing as it is on ""Posed to Be in Love"".</p>
<p>There's also a sense that Gates is holding back somewhat. There are only a few guests, the biggest being <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a>, who sounds like he's glancing at his watch while contributing a verse and the chorus to ""Bet I'm on It"". It's likely that Gates is saving them for the future rather than using up that major label budget now, but he doesn't really need them anyways—he's a fascinating persona all on his own. With <i>By All Means </i>he<i> </i>completes a three-release run that's as solid as any in recent memory, even if the answer to the question of whether he has another gear in him remains unanswered for the time being. </p></div>"|19109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19109-kevin-gates-by-any-means/|7.5|Renato Pagnani

In 2001, following the release of <i>Aaltopiiri</i>, the pair encouraged people to write and suggest tour locations to them, with the most appealing and/or unusual destinations chosen for a subsequent set of dates. This album for the <a href=""http://kvitnu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kvitnu</a> label, a live effort recorded in 2009 in Kyiv in the Ukraine, is impossible to frame without thinking about the impending meltdown of both band and country, cloaking <i>Oksastus</i> in an apocalyptic backdrop. It's not clear yet if this marks a return to active duty by Pan Sonic, but this is more than a mere curio released to mark the final days of the band. Instead, it's a meticulously recorded document, laced with all the brutality and turmoil of their prior recordings, and an anything-could-happen looseness that flows out of their improvisatory approach.</p>
<p><i>Oksastus</i> straddles a rich divide—its title is a Finnish word that can either mean the process of grafting or the cultivation of plants. Pan Sonic music never really feels like a graft, but it does take work to get inside it, to dig through the overlapping walls of noise to get to its cold heart. There's no sense of journey involved; instead it can be like peering into a cement mixer and watching new shapes appear and vanish inside its churn. Stand there long enough and even the smallest of movements can take on a significance greater than the infinitesimal change seen by the naked eye. On ""5'31"" (titles are replaced by runtimes throughout) a great loop of noise turns lethargically through its center as familiarly piercing electronics vye with a leaden undertow. Even as it approaches the point of white-out there's a strong sense of being trapped in time, lost in its mechanical engulf.</p>
<p>Where Pan Sonic succeed in their work, both here and elsewhere, is in the subtle bridging of discipline and the impromptu. They're somewhere between chaos and order, setting out rigid backbones to tracks, some of which harken back to mechanized sounds that mirror the earliest drum machines or synthesized drums. From there it resembles a battle between ship and wave, with both sides winning out at various junctures. Their use of repetition was chiseled down to a fine art by this point, and listening to them use it on a track such as the sprawling ""11'03"" is a fascinating experience—this isn't repetition to get lost in, to transport you away. It's there to drag you in, to keep you alert. It's the direct opposite of krautrock dreams or techno fantasias, even though roots of those genres can be found across Pan Sonic's output. Instead this is a nightmarish vision of the everyday, a stark and arresting vision of existence that spews out humanity's ugliness across a mixing board and a mesh of wires.</p>
<p>It's when control bears down a little too hard that this collection loses focus. On ""5'42"" they're phoning in darkness, sometimes resembling the hordes of John Carpenter clones that would thunder through the gates a year or two after this show was recorded. Occasionally a super-high frequency cuts through the gloom, such as on the opening of ""17'28"" or on the close of the final track, the almost comically clonk-like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Exorcist_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sweet Exorcist</a> clone ""5'41"". It's something Pan Sonic were known for—wrapping piercing textures in a maelstrom of noise. But here, in a work that bears an air of finality, even becoming definitive at times, it adds an air of sentimentality to <i>Oksastus</i>, especially when that singular tone trails off into silence at the record's close. Affection isn't an emotion usually attached to this band, but here, engulfed by thoughts that they might not return again, there's something moving in hearing that eardrum-shattering note unspool for one last time.</p></div>"|19158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19158-pan-sonic-oksastus/|7.1|Nick Neyland

Tim DeWit is sort of like a machine elf for pop’s avant garde, doing influential, mind-bending work that ripples across huge swaths of culture while remaining largely unknown to anyone who hasn’t been properly enlightened. He was a founding member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a>, and co-produced their landmark 2008 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12324-saint-dymphna/"" target=""_blank""><i>Saint Dymphna</i></a> after a gunshot wound to his chest ended his stint as their drummer. He’s performed at the zeitgeisty Ghe2o G0th1k parties, composed music for the fashion line Hood By Air, contributed to the soundtrack for the Baltimore biker documentary <i>12 O’Clock Boys</i>, and was sampled on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a>. If it’s edgy, weird, and involves electronic music in any way, DeWit’s probably brushed up against it.</p>
<p><i>IN.RAK.DUST</i> is DeWit’s first full-length release under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32147-dutch-e-germ/"" target=""_blank"">Dutch E Germ</a>, and his most substantial artistic statement since <i>Saint Dymphna</i>. In some ways it feels like a continuation of that album’s aesthetic mission, and in some ways it even feels like an improvement. That said, the differences between DeWit’s two projects are numerous. While GGD acted like an art rock band that often incorporated elements of hip-hop, house, and grime into its sound, Dutch E Germ almost entirely removes rock from the equation, with DeWit applying his psychedelic filter directly to various forms of bass music. And where his work with GGD was often masked behind a thick sonic haze, <i>IN.RAK.DUST</i> has a bracing hi-fi clarity to its booms and crackles.</p>
<p>What hasn’t changed is DeWit’s ambitious range of influences—<i>IN.RAK.DUST</i> is rooted in hip-hop and house but incorporates everything from trap rap to something that sounds like a Bollywood ballad with dozens of stops in between—and his gift for assembling them into pleasingly weird and intensely trippy new forms. Losing the blurry analog noise elements of GGD’s sound hasn’t affected DeWit’s ability to impart his recordings with a shimmering, mushroomy aura, and he’s become a master of transforming electronic glitches into 21st century psychedelia, as he did with the flickering, stroboscopic meltdown of a vocal sample from “IntroXXXWar” (originally released as “HBA War”) that Kanye lifted for the intro to “New Slaves”. He also remains conscientious about maintaining an impressively accessible vibe even when he goes far out, and the album’s danceable even at its most experimental moments.</p>
<p>With <i>IN.RAK.DUST</i>, DeWit’s accomplished what seems to have been his goal for years: the creation of a new kind of dub, a worthy spiritual descendent to the music that emanated out of Studio One and the Black Ark back in the day while sounding almost nothing like it. Too many of dub’s progeny have borrowed its sonic palette but not its philosophy of mad technological experimentation, which was the whole point of the style. Even when he’s creating a track from scratch it still feels like an assemblage put together from disparate parts—a house beat, a reggae bassline, a synth lead picked up from a Southern rap song—that just happen to fit together perfectly. He also knows that gear sometimes sounds best when used in unintended ways, and <i>IN.RAK.DUST</i> is full of off-label programming, and electronics pushed into glitchy places they weren’t designed for. It’s easily one of the most technically daring and impressively produced albums of the year so far.</p>
<p>One other crucial thing that DeWit’s music has in common with dub is that even at its most haywire it remains spiritually centered, although that’s not necessarily apparent. The album doesn’t have any one obviously prescribed use—you can dance to it as easily as you can choreograph a runway show to it, or you could just use it as a soundtrack for getting high. My favorite way to listen to <i>IN.RAK.DUST</i> is to put on my best and bassiest headphones and experience it while I travel around the city. In DeWit’s hands, even the most crowded subway becomes serene and blissful, and the most mundane task deeply cosmic.</p></div>"|19142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19142-dutch-e-germ-inrakdust/|7.6|Miles Raymer

But one thing’s certain: Lamont “Bim” Thomas would show up a lot. He’s played drums in <a href=""http://www.wordriot.org/archives/874"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">V-3</a>, <a href=""http://www.intheredrecords.com/pages/bassholes.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Bassholes</a>,<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tinsmomentinblackhistory"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> the</a> <a href=""http://unholytwo12xu.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unholy Two</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tinsmomentinblackhistory"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Moment in Black History</a>,<a href=""http://hozacrecords.com/2011/07/puffy-areolas/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> and Puffy Aerolas</a>; the latter two still enlist his services regularly. But his most important project is turning out to be one he does on his own. In just three years he’s cranked out three albums and a bunch of EPs and singles as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9190-records-guitars-people/3/"">Obnox</a>, pouring his experiences, influences, and considerable energies into burning-red noise-punk blasts.</p>
<p>Obnox has been prolific because Thomas works quickly. His 2011 debut <i><a href=""http://www.12xu.bigcartel.com/product/obnox-i-m-bleeding-now-lp-12xu-039-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I’m Bleeding Now</a> </i><span>was recorded on his own four-track in a week, and subsequent releasess have followed suit. (""I just bang it out fast, like the record business used to be,” he once <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2011/07/bim_thomas_goes_solo_with_a_ba.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>.) I’d bet it didn’t take him a ton of time to put together </span><i>Louder Space </i><span>either, but there was one significant difference in the way it was made: as the title implies, Thomas recorded for the first time in a studio, Columbus’ legendary </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9067-musicol/"">Musicol</a>.</p>
<p>The timing of this move was perfect, as Thomas’ songs have gotten wider and deeper, and thus ripe for being rendered in finer detail. In other words, he was ready for his close-up. But sharper clarity <span>doesn’t lessen the abrasive thrust of Obnox’s attack. He’s still painting in, as he </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9190-records-guitars-people/3/""><span>describes it</span></a><span>, “sheets of rhythm,” and </span><i>Louder Space </i><span>is piled high with them. Those layers are even more powerful when you can sift through them carefully. Part of the fun of listening to Obnox in higher-res is how easy it is to focus on a blazing guitar line here or a detonating drum beat there, without losing sight of Thomas’ forest-sized din.</span></p>
<p>That din is more surprise-filled than before, due to Thomas exploring more of his musical obsessions. <i>Louder Space</i><span> is based in punk rock, but he continually leaps from that center toward less expected modes. So on “Red I”, soulful horns are buried under guitar fuzz; on “</span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/gerardcosloy/obnox-molecule"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Molecule</span></a><span>”, chopped-up metal chords buttress a chant; and on “Raindrops”, grunge riffs slide under sugared vocals. Most noticeably, Thomas’ love for hip-hop and R&amp;B shines through all the buzzing churn. The wiry guitar loop of “</span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/obnox-1/obnox-how-to-rob-the-punk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>How to Rob (The Punk Years)</span></a><span>” could circle a Public Enemy tune, while “</span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/gerardcosloy/obnox-bitch-get-money"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Bitch! Get Money!</span></a><span>” hides a funk saunter inside its frantic amp-bleed. There’s even a gospel tint to the album’s only slow song, a near-ballad bluntly titled “Feeling Real Black Today.”</span></p>
<p>Thomas’ style-melding is so smooth, it gives <i>Louder Space </i><span>a sheen of confidence. His music has never exactly been shy, but here he sounds like he knows he’s reached a new plane and isn’t afraid to say so. “You never find a fuckin’ ounce of fat on me!” he insists at one point; later, he chants posi-mantras in “Mecca Son Shine”—“Gotta chase my own glory/ Gotta write my own story/ Gotta grind my own dollars/ Gotta solve my own problems”—as if his brain is pumping iron. His throat does calisthenics too: </span><span>Thomas jumps his voice through hoops, crooning, rapping, and ranting in perpetual call-and-response with himself.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All of this may make </span><i>Louder Space</i><span> sound like brazen boasting, and at times it is. But Thomas’ boldness is more about assured self-confidence—more about belief in his own sonic mission—than vain puffing of feathers. And besides, he's earned the right to stick out his chest a bit. </span><span><i>Louder Space</i> transcends not only his previous work, but much of the scene that he’s ensconced in. That makes it something worth bragging about.</span></p></div>"|19104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19104-obnox-louder-space/|8.0|Marc Masters

Sure, the fact <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex</a> became the face of dubstep did plenty to rile the “purists,” but the Tempa–12“-hoarder set wasn’t responsible for reducing an unsubtle but genuinely adventurous and accessibly weird artist to a living meme. Outlets that eyerolled at first-wave dubstep as too niche belatedly rushed to hail Skrillex as the person who could—hallelujah!—finally make electronic music that you could mosh to and glibly compare to punk-fuckin’-rawk. By the beginning of this year, it was starting to feel like the reduction of his music’s endorphin-explosion dynamics to a ”wait for the drop"" punchline would drain all the giddiness out of Skrillex’s catalogue before he even got around to a full-length debut.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, all the thinkpieces about corporate rave and pop crossover and subgenre snobbery weren’t enough to obscure just how open Skrillex has been to switching his game up. You could call it from the word go: 2010’s <i>My Name Is Skrillex</i> delivered sugar-high jolts of French Touch that integrated Todd Edwards-style chopped-vocal fusillades into Justice-style snarl-house. And while the trademark mechano-industrial shivers and alarms in his subsequent work sound like chaotic ADD noise on the surface, it’s also frenetically unpredictable and musically <i>fun</i> in a way not commonly heard since the crab-scratch heyday of super-advanced turntablism. (Listen to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILvWRGW7EYY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mix Master Mike’s <i>Napalm Rockets</i></a>—released a few months before <i>My Name Is Skrillex</i>—for a great if probably unexpected precedent.) No matter that he learned about IDM when Korn gave Aphex Twin props on TRL; the point is that Skrillex decided he wouldn’t stop learning. And yet that’s why <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54309-stream-skrillexs-surprise-album-recess-featuring-chance-the-rapper-passion-pit-diplo-more/"" target=""_blank"">Recess</a> </i>is confounding: it hints at places Skrillex could take his sound, but doesn’t feel ready to commit to any of them.</p>
<p>What expectation-meeting wub-wub stuff there is on this album is diverting and enjoyable, even if it feels obligatory in the context of this album's attempt at breadth. I mean, the leadoff cut is called “All Is Fair in Love and Brostep”—the man clearly knows the joke and is savvy enough to turn it into a “yes, and” improv sketch. That he gives the opening-track spotlight to a guest spot by the Ragga Twins—the MCs whose early 1990s singles made them connoisseur go-tos and pivotal figures in the early UK rave and jungle scene—points to a lineage that his detractors rarely gave him credit for. And the track is fittingly rugged—nothing that’ll have dubstep aficionados forgetting the Bug anytime soon, but it’s easy to hear the fundamental strength of his basslines and the nuanced timing of percussion. Between “All Is Fair”, the more explicitly dancehall-informed Ragga Twins teamup “Ragga Bomb”, and the crowdpleasing “Try It Out” (built alongside Owsla signee Alvin Risk), Skrillex proves adept at going beyond the build-drop-build-drop Pavlov response to something a bit more dynamic and playful.</p>
<p>But the broader sound is also pretty familiar at this point, an issue that he’s aimed to confront with the album’s forays into whatever-works eclecticism. Sometimes the results are at least fascinatingly off-kilter. “Doompy Poomp” is the biggest wait-what? moment on the album, a galumphing kind of schaffel/wonky/IDM hydra that’s all candy-colored grotesque. “Fuck That” dials back the bass a bit to something more in line with the distant swells of circa-02 Horsepower Productions sides, wraps his sensibilities around a beat more befitting of contemporary bass music, and builds the big ramp-up moment towards a switched-up version of the rhythm that bristles with negative space. And “Fire Away” returns to the shallow-Burial shot at spacious UK garage that he tried out on ""Leaving"", a tolerable effort that’s upended by jarringly twee melodic accents and the grating wail of singer Kid Harpoon.</p>
<p>What’s worrying is the stuff that seems to sidestep his oddball ADD energy completely. Even if brostep <i>is</i> pop these days, it’s at least pop in a polarizingly abrasive sense; his maneuvers towards other more accessible sounds not only sound less bracing but feel pulled out of his hands. Teaming up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a> and getting K-pop superstars <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31688-g-dragon/"" target=""_blank"">G-Dragon</a> (Big Bang) and CL (2NE1) is an inspired move in theory, but “Dirty Vibe” sounds so dominated by familiar Southern bounce and trap tropes that it feels like Skrillex is taking a smoke break and letting Mad Decent take over for a bit. The title track is even more confused—Fatman Scoop and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"" target=""_blank"">Passion Pit</a>’s Michael Angelakos together at… last?—with pseudo-Sleigh Bells pep rally bluster and bang-on-a-PVC-pipe moombahton that plays like decline-era big beat. And “Coast Is Clear” is jazzed-up d’n’b that keeps tripping over its own snares, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53918-watch-skrillex-plays-new-collaboration-with-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a>’s voice the closest there is to an element of wavering chaos; shame his appearance is little more than a repeated if extended hook. (At least the machine-gun “doyouwannafuck, doyouwannafuck, doyouwannafuck” refrain has staying power.)</p>
<p>The progression from early singles to first album isn’t nearly the same arc as it was just 10 years ago, but it’s still weird that the first full-length showcase for Skrillex as self-contained album artist feels more like a transitional record than a debut that plays to his strengths. It’s tempting to suggest he’s ahead of the curve when it comes to the eventuality of the sound he popularized getting stale, but he probably has his own reasons for tweaking, sanding down, subduing, or otherwise retooling the parameters for what could be considered his signature aesthetic. If it points his fanbase towards another set of sounds to appreciate, it could be at least somewhat worth it. But more of these half measures, and they might just wind up deciding to listening to someone else entirely.</p></div>"|19139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19139-skrillex-recess/|5.7|Nate Patrin

A random, anonymous person putting music online is something that happens thousands of times a day, but Evian Christ’s productions got around, quickly, on the strength of “Who is this?” raves from publications like Dummy and a number of blogs. Returning to them more than two years later, these early tracks, especially the startling and forceful “Fuck It None of Y’all Don’t Rap”, hinted at serious potential, even if they didn’t quite congeal into a distinctive voice. But one important person heard something in them: Kanye West used some of Evian Christ’s music to construct “I’m in It” from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a>, and suddenly, the kid who posted beats to YouTube had a hand in one of the most sonically adventurous records of the year.</p>
<p>Shortly after that initial burst of interest, Evian Christ (real name: Joshua Leary) signed to Tri Angle, who assembled his early tracks onto an EP. The label was the logical home for his music in part because his path was similar to that of Tri Angle’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>. But while Clams Casino sent his tracks to rappers and only later presented himself as an instrumental auteur, Evian Christ, despite the contribution to <i>Yeezus</i>, has been perceived more as producer of standalone electronic tracks. <i>The Waterfall</i> EP, his first release of new music constructed while people actually know who he is, finds him straddling the worlds of the functional collaborative production and discrete statement.</p>
<p>What’s most striking about <i>Waterfall</i>, hearing it next to those earliest tracks, is how much <i>bigger</i> his music has become. The early tracks eventually collected on the <i>Kings and Them</i> were nimble and spacious, touching on genres like two-step that allow for tricky stop-start programming. From <i>Waterfall</i>’s opening <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53088-listen-evian-christ-salt-carousel-from-new-waterfall-ep/"" target=""_blank"">“Salt Carousel”</a> forward, it’s clear that Leary is trying to rattle all the way back to the cheap seats. The is essentially big-stage EDM, with colossal surges of bass and thick, serrated synth lines evocative of the maximalism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"" target=""_blank"">TNGHT</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Mohawke</a>. It’s the type of music that makes most sense at massive volume, with builds and drops whose meaning becomes clear only when the sound is completely overwhelming. And in terms of sound design and construction, <i>Waterfall</i> has much to admire. The music is bursting with color and the surges are palpable, and you can almost see the legions of head-banging festival-goers whenever tracks hit a big peak.</p>
<p>The problem is that the four tracks here have a total of about three ideas. Three <i>well executed</i> ideas, no doubt, but it’s still not enough to make the record feel like a complete experience. Once you’ve heard one track—and each is in its own way a banger—you’ve heard all four. So when experienced outside of the massive soundsystem and communal experience of a live event, <i>Waterfall</i> comes over as something closer to a beat tape—when listening to it, I even find myself unconsciously inserting the ghost of a Danny Brown verse, something to transform the Grade-A sonics into a track with an arc and some tension, a piece of music with a few surprises or twists. Impressive as it can be in small doses, <i>Waterfall</i> as a whole plows ahead like a WWI-era tank, heavy and lumbering and powerful but pretty much limited to a single direction.</p></div>"|19118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19118-evian-christ-waterfall-ep/|7.3|Mark Richardson

This handsomely appointed Deutsche Grammophon release of recordings by<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27735-bryce-dessner/"" target=""_blank""> Bryce Dessner</a>, guitarist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1819-jonny-greenwood/"" target=""_blank"">Jonny Greenwood</a>, guitarist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>, is one sign, among many, of shifting cultural tides. ""Rock star"" is an altogether more genteel occupation in this century than it was in the last—Dessner and Greenwood in particular enjoy a middlebrow cultural cachet somewhere between ""TED Fellow"" and ""HBO show runner."" And the classical music industry is relieved to have modern cultural ambassadors that won't make them feel foolish or craven. </p>
<p>Dessner and Greenwood have thus built up enviable composing careers for themselves. Their works are programmed by tony, first-class institutions, and positioned next to other contemporary composers, not consigned to the Friday-night concert that serves drinks. Greenwood has a head start on Dessner—his suite for <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11007-there-will-be-blood-ost/"" target=""_blank"">There Will Be Blood</a></i>, from 2007, enjoys a robust performance life and <i>Popcorn Superhet Receiver</i>, from which portions of this work were taken <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M69QXO/ref=dm_ws_sp_ps_dp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has been recorded already</a>. Dessner, however, is catching up; last year, none other than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6375-kronos-quartet/"" target=""_blank"">the Kronos Quartet</a> devoted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18702-bryce-dessner-aheym-by-kronos-quartet/"" target=""_blank"">a full album to his compositions</a>. Now, whenever a prominent contemporary music festival is scheduled—such as this spring's <a href=""http://www.bigearsfestival.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Ears Festival</a> in Knoxville, which also features Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche—Dessner and Greenwood are included. </p>
<p>It helps that their compositions do as much work as their names. Greenwood's <i>There Will Be Blood</i> suite is foreboding and inky-black, a work whose extended quotes of Penderecki and Ligeti do nothing to obscure the thumbprint of Greenwood's sensibility. The leaping, fiendish, cello line will forever be associated with Daniel Plainview, and the glinting blue eyes in Daniel Day-Lewis's soot-covered face as he proclaims his disgust for  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_636894&amp;feature=iv&amp;list=PLF109AF643A4B026A&amp;src_vid=28BXqQWqYJU&amp;v=x1ij_TEK_MM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""these...people."" </a>The slow-fall-in-free-space <i>glissandi</i> that punctuate the ""Henry Plainview"" movement, the most obvious Ligeti touch, break open into plangent, lovely string writing, a push-pull between furtive remorse and throbbing evil keeps the piece from curdling.</p>
<p>Dessner's surprisingly mordant sensibility is a match for Greenwood's. On his ""St. Carolyn By the Sea"", moaning tremolos pass like a fever chill through the orchestra and show up in the guitars a few minutes later, goose flesh prickling the music's surface. There are guitars in the work,  but they are twinkling and demure, and often feel like they are murmuring to quiet the upheaval of the shuddering beast that is the full orchestra. The work builds to a martial tattoo of an ending and cuts off, leaving its sharp outline visible in our minds.</p>
<p>Dessner's ear for string writing is particularly rich. The chords that move through the beginning of ""Lachrimae"" carry some Barber in their DNA, an impression that gets upset later when a cello bows out hoarse-voiced harmonics high up near the bridge. ""Raphael"", builds from wispy tendrils of sound into a super-saturated moment of full orchestral color, a blazing sunrise burning fog off of a river. The work stretches majestically over 17 minutes, maintaining a slow build that might feel familiar to the muscle-memories of post-rock fans. It is glacial, patiently ecstatic, and further evidence that Dessner's vision could support some large-scale works. Whoever wants to commission his first symphony would probably be rewarded with something fantastic. </p></div>"|19141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19141-jonny-greenwood-bryce-dessner-st-carolyn-by-the-sea-suite-from-there-will-be-blood/|7.8|Jayson Greene

Enough to fill a mall?” he asks rhetorically on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16464-argentina-parts-i-ii-iii/"">“Argentina (Pts., I, II, III)”</a>, the leadoff track from the Canadian quartet’s third LP <i>Forcefield</i>. Well, we can start out by narrowing it down to an estimate of 300,000. That’s the maximum number of people who could own both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes"">the Strokes</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7539-first-impressions-of-earth/""><i>First Impressions of Earth</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer"">Weezer</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8611-weezer-green-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Green Album</i></a>. <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/News/tokyo_police_club_discuss_riff-rocking_new_lp_eye_early_2014_release"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Monks joked about how the much-maligned “Juicebox” and “Hash Pipe” were spiritual guides for the band during the creation of <i>Forcefield</i></span></a>, where they’d play “rock riffs” that would previously be laughed out of the room. Only this time, they admitted “wait a minute, these are good and fun.” His point seems to be that you don’t even have to like those much-maligned songs. You just have to believe that it's not necessarily a bad idea when bands known for taut, hooky laments about girl problems grab the Gibson SG from the Guitar Center wall and let it rip.<i> Forcefield</i> is very much good and fun when it sticks to the theoretical appeal of Monks’ concept. There are just as many times when it hits the unfortunate, actual mark.</p>
<p>The title of <i>Forcefield</i> makes Tokyo Police Club’s intentions abundantly clear; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53554-tokyo-police-club-announce-new-album-forcefield-share-hot-tonight/"">Monks says it reflects the band shutting out the countless microtrends</a> that came and went during the curious, long silence following 2010’s light heavyweight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14335-champ/""><i>Champ</i></a>. Kudos to Tokyo Police Club for giving up any sort of notion that they represent “cool” indie rock, but it’s unnecessary; though they were viewed as a bridge from the New Rock Revolution into the crapshoot of mid-00s blog-rock, neither <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11426-elephant-shell/""><i>Elephant Shell</i> </a>nor <i>Champ</i> sounded of a particular moment, which made them easy to overlook.</p>
<p>But it’s also a misleading title. In actuality, <i>Forcefield</i> is the only Tokyo Police Club album that appears to be in tune with prevailing trends. In case you haven’t realized it yet, indie rock is basically pop now and Tokyo Police Club seem energized by not having to pretend like their candy hearts don’t pump Kool-Aid. The bubblegum alt-glam of “Hot Tonight” should be blasting out of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stacy’s mom’s</a> minivan. “Toy Guns” outsources the shrugging, shuffling beat of its chiming chorus from Avril Lavigne’s “Complicated.” “Through the Wire” bears no similarity whatsoever to the Kanye West classic, but its rhythm swings to the same beat as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15784-haim-the-wire/"">that <i>other</i> song about the wire</a>.</p>
<p>Befitting its mostly compact-disc era influences, the sound of <i>Forcefield</i> is flat, shiny, spotless and unyielding<i>—</i>a naturally artificial production shift as recording duties were passed from Chris Zane (who helmed similarly snappy records from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit"">Passion Pit</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26767-friendly-fires/"">Friendly Fires</a>) to Doug Boehm, an engineer on Miley Cyrus and Fall Out Boy LPs. Tokyo Police Club’s commitment is admirable<i>—</i>this a pop album, produced like pop and structured to grant instant gratification. And yet, this presentation throws the flaws of Tokyo Police Club’s dullest songs into sharp relief.</p>
<p>As Monks promised, there <i>are</i> rock riffs<i>—</i>the one from “Tunnel Vision” is situated somewhere between Angus Young and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Vp7TmTfVZI&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Satch’s “Summer Song”</a>, while the windmilled power of “Gonna Be Ready” is a surprising show of brute force. And there are choruses, good ones too, absolute wonders in isolation. But whereas previous Tokyo Police Club albums were economical, cramming the greatest number of melodies into the smallest spaces, the craftsmanship of <i>Forcefield</i> is kinda shoddy and cheap. “Gonna Be Ready” and “Miserable” in particular are done in by dawdling, underwritten verses that make the hooks feel like prizes buried in stale, glazed Cracker Jack. Yeah, “don’t bore us, get to the chorus” and all, but within the context of three-minute pop songs, 30 seconds is a lot of time to waste on lyrics like “I wanna live in the Bahamas/ <i>Ah ha</i>...I heard about it from a friend of a friend”.</p>
<p>Or maybe the biggest problem is that <i>Forcefield</i> has to be judged relative to “Argentina (Pts. I, II, III)”, a total outlier that also takes up nearly 30% of its total runtime. To put things into perspective, Tokyo Police Club have never written a song longer than four minutes. This one is nearly nine, but its tripartite structure simply means it’s the three best songs on <i>Forcefield</i> all at once rather than some prog odyssey. It’s a grand, large-scale display of everything that makes Tokyo Police Club likeable in the first place<i>—</i>Monks’ weedy vocals and wry lyrics (“If I was a lighthouse/ I would look all over the place/ If I was an asshole/ Thank you for keeping a smile on your face”), a knack for making verse melodies as catchy of those of the chorus, and yes, there’s some showboat riffing cribbed from post-<i>Green Album</i> Weezer. So Tokyo Police Club were in the right frame of mind when they called this thing <i>Forcefield</i>: they didn’t need to look outside themselves to make a truly great record. But after “Argentina”, you just wish they took their own advice more often.</p></div>"|19087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19087-tokyo-police-club-forcefield/|6.4|Ian Cohen

Throughout the five tracks of his short fourth solo album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29253-barn-owl/"" target=""_blank"">Barn Owl</a> multi-instrumentalist Jon Porras moves between wobbling drones and chromatic keyboard melodies, between deep beats and microscopic clicks, between foreboding bass yawns and comforting silvery drift with the enthusiasm of someone now plying these styles for the first time. That movement affords <i>Light Divide</i> an alluring phantom feeling: Just when the rhythm starts to become metronomic, it breaks apart and scatters. And when any one tone starts to become too pervasive, Porras drops it or bends it suddenly in the other direction. A meticulous assemblage of sequencers and synthesizers, drum machines and aleatoric percussion, small beeps and tectonic booms, <i>Light Divide</i> refracts and then reorders moody electronic music, creating more of a mirage than a mere collage.</p>
<p>This unrest isn’t new for Porras: Barn Owl is best known for their long-form, two-guitar stares, which sail into the gentle distance or burn out in fits of noise. But across their eight-year development, Porras and co-founder Evan Caminiti have constantly broadened their palette and approach by adding piano, organ, or even traces of voices, particularly on last year’s <i>V</i>. In and out of Barn Owl, Porras and Caminiti have been active collaborators, too. Their respective strings of solo records have often seemed like workshops for the duo’s continued refinement and expansion, with Caminiti projecting guitar themes toward the unending horizon and Porras slowly transitioning from six strings to electronic-oriented abstraction. To that end, <i>Light Divide</i> is his most definitive statement by himself, even if its sense of mercury raises questions about the future stamp of his individual pursuits.</p>
<p>The sounds on <i>Light Divide</i> will suggest a litany of electronic referents: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker</a> and Laurie Spiegel, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Stott</a> and John Carpenter, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"" target=""_blank"">Christian Fennesz</a> and Keith Rowe, to sample. But if it feels occasionally like Porras is only plundering the familiar, know that the trick of <i>Light Divide</i> comes with context. With the attention Porras has paid to layers, this album works well as low-volume headphones music. You can catch mesmerizing details in the descent toward silence at the middle of “New Monument” and notice the graceful, shy melody behind the static din near the end of “Recollection”. It’s easier to hear the four-on-the-floor beat of opener “Apeiron” disintegrate from such a short distance, especially since it falls apart only after falling under the attack of several subtle contrasting rhythms. But for all of its intricacy, <i>Light Divide </i>often operates behind a forward curtain of volume and power; many of those more slight maneuvers occur behind commanding tones or around bulging rhythms. During “Divide”, for instance, airy tones whorl through throbbing bass and pressing organ. And though “Pleiades” tunnels through a set of thin static scrims and microscopic pops, it moves laterally between a Tim Hecker-sized hum, an ascendant keyboard melody and, at its end, a martial house clip that demands loud speakers and a hard right turn of the volume knob. <i>Light Divide</i> functions as a sort of palimpsest, then, where different settings reveal contrasting components within the whole, aspects that might have been overlooked through either headphones or a living room stereo alone.   </p>
<p>Both the restlessness and wide toolkit that make <i>Light Divide </i>a compelling, rather brief listen do suggest a potential problem for Porras’ solo work: He shamelessly evokes those who have long charted similar territory, and Porras’ music, both in idea and execution, can feel somewhat indistinguishable from those antecedents. At the very least, he’s yet to show how he’s separate from or superior to a median or mean of those people whose music his suggests. That is, admittedly, part of the intrigue with <i>Light Divide</i>—hearing how a musician known for his distant guitar pontification digests and then delivers the sound of a very active and <i>au courant </i>electronic subset. But how can Jon Porras go from making very good records that read like strings of Recommended if You Like references to making records that belong in a list of RIYL standbys? That is a long-term worry for Porras, anyway. For now, he’s made the most efficient and best-directed solo album of his career. No matter how much it wades through established styles or sources, it sorts and stacks them in unfamiliar patterns that depend upon and demand careful listening—out loud <i>and </i>in isolation. </p></div>"|19089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19089-jon-porras-light-divide/|7.6|Grayson Haver Currin

So let’s just get this out of the way: 2005’s<i> Let It Bloom</i> is still their best album. That’s not meant as a slight to their later work, but rather an acknowledgement of just how thrilling the early, ragged material could be: the way they <i>screamed</i> just after the intro of “Not a Problem”; their hypnotizing, fluid cover of Jacques Dutronc’s “Hippie, Hippie, Hoorah”; the swooning, filth-caked ballad “Dirty Hands”. Everything on that LP was well-written and performed in a way that was exciting and distinctive. Before they had crowds freaking out to “Bad Kids” and “O Katrina!”, these songs anchored their shows (as captured on their great live album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9939-los-valientes-del-mundo-nuevo/""><i>Los Valientes del Mundo Nuevo</i></a>).</p>
<p>Even as they cleaned up their sound, Black Lips’ best records since have kept the same grit, glam, and grime they had at the beginning. Mark Ronson’s production on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15494-arabia-mountain/""><i>Arabia Mountain</i></a>‘s “Family Tree”, for example, had a vintage, musty record store atmosphere to it, with saxophones and arrangements that made them sound like they were auditioning to be Rufus Thomas’ backing band. With Ronson, they proved that their unrefined songs could still hit with an A-list producer. So the fact that they recorded in Nashville with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"">the Black Keys</a>’ Patrick Carney on seven of <i>Underneath the Rainbow</i>’s 12 tracks isn’t something to dismiss out of hand.</p>
<p>But another producer is responsible for the album’s best songs. Four tracks were recorded in New York with Tom Brenneck, who worked with the band on <i>Arabia Mountain</i> and played guitar for Sharon Jones, Amy Winehouse, Cee-Lo Green, and others. “Smiling”, a song about spending the night in jail, is the first in a run of Brenneck-recorded highlights. It was originally intended to be <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/black-lips-go-underneath-the-rainbow-on-new-album-20131212"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about Gucci Mane</a>, but, thankfully, Jared Swilley had the sense to to base it on his own experience behind bars. He sings about pissing in a cup, not being able to sleep because of the fluorescent lights, and sharing old Newports, and the details, when added to the song’s sunny and catchy melody, lend a grinning, toothless charm, not unlike what they exuded on “Dirty Hands”. Brenneck also oversees “Make You Mine”, the expertly crafted power pop song co-written with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2699-mastodon/"">Mastodon</a>’s Brent Hinds, and “Funny”, which features what are probably the album’s dumbest lyrics (“come suck some milk from my titties”) and a careeningly tenuous vocal performance from Cole Alexander. Here, the band find their old fire, juvenile as it may be.</p>
<p>The Carney material, by contrast, is hit and miss, to say the least. The twee romp “I Don’t Wanna Go Home”, co-written by soul singer <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Curtis-Harding/1392287757658766"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Curtis Harding</a>, and “Dog Years”, which was penned with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7862-bradford-cox/"">Bradford Cox</a>, are highlights. But other Carney-helmed tracks are utterly faceless, which, for a band with Black Lips’ reputation, is unacceptable. The vocals in “Dorner Party”, “Justice After All”, and “Waiting” are stiff and generic, aiming for a sort of new wave affectation that doesn’t work. Individuality has been sanded away. Since the the lyrics are uncharacteristically tepid, blame can't be solely attributed to Carney, but it is worth noting that until the Lips’ vocals come in, the stomp of “Dandelion Dust” could easily be mistaken for a Keys track.</p>
<p>The album’s centerpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53681-video-the-black-lips-boys-in-the-wood-featuring-drugs-violence-piss-and-more/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">“Boys in the Wood”</a>, a slow, Southern-rock-tinged song recorded with Brenneck, was the record’s first single. Heard in isolation, it didn’t work, but it sounds great in the context of <i>Underneath the Rainbow</i>. Coming after a dull patch, it’s a sudden injection of life, with a thoughtful and well-paced arrangement. Unlike the Steve Mackay-style sax on <i>Arabia Mountain</i>’s “Mad Dog”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5423-the-budos-band/"">the Budos Band</a>’s horns on this one recall Allen Toussaint’s arrangements for the Band’s <i>Rock of Ages</i>—Southern rock songs emboldened by soulful brass. Counter to the album as a whole, it’s proof that Black Lips can step outside their comfort zone, craft an ambitious song, and still sound like themselves.</p></div>"|19099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19099-the-black-lips-underneath-the-rainbow/|6.3|Evan Minsker

HBO’s popular adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s swords and sorcery drama <i>Game of Thrones</i> is the latest to weather criticism for its dealings with race, from the noted absence of people of color in early seasons to their depiction in later seasons as uncivilized masses in need of white guidance. With the show returning for a fourth season of blood-soaked castle keep intrigue next month, the network is determined to make inroads to a more diverse viewership. Apparently “attract more minorities” means “pander to urban audiences with rap music” because HBO’s power play for multicultural patronage looks a lot like a mixtape.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Catch the Throne </i>drafts the production team from New York’s Launch Point Records to fashion hip-hop beats out of the show’s rich, dramatic orchestral score and select swatches of dialogue from key characters. The result is a collection of rousing aspirational stompers interspersed with Eastern scales and instrumentation, tasked both with honoring the show’s musical accompaniment and holding the attention of casual onlookers. Launch Point makes a noble go at it, but the source material is too stuffy to allow them to shine. The same could be said of the cadre of rap, reggaeton and dancehall artists featured throughout <i>Catch the Throne</i>, who do their best to skirt the patent absurdity of the mixtape’s premise but invariably end up falling on their own swords.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When these rappers aren’t struggling to explain Martin’s tangled plot and reveling in veiled references to Westeros lore, they’re puking up bored motivational boilerplate. Opener “Mother of Dragons” finds <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7749-big-boi/"" target=""_blank"">Big Boi</a> unfurling plot intensive lines like “Targaryen, the rightful bloodline/ So don’t you worry about the Red Wedding, that made it crunch time” and “Fuck the Lannisters and everybody that ride with ‘em”. Bodega Bamz spends “Win or Die” tripping on platitudes about life during wartime (“You lose if you break the rules/ Kings do what they have to do”). Nobody can resist a pat joke about dragon taming queen Khaleesi: Bamz “spits fire like Khaleesi”, Wale brings us “that Khaleesi heat” and “The Parallel” sees Dee Goodz in search of a “female species with physical features of the girl Khaleesi”. Barring dancehall star Magazeen’s “Iron Throne”, which succeeds by avoiding show specifics in favor of a fatalistic world-weariness, and “Magical Reality”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30612-kilo-kish/"" target=""_blank"">Kilo Kish</a>’s fetching mining of <i>Game of Thrones</i>’ undercurrent of sensual mysticism, <i>Catch the Throne </i>is clunker after cringeworthy clunker. Rampant spoilers and the high learning curve for the languages and lore that riddle the lyrics ensure that these songs won’t make any sense to anyone that doesn’t already know the material.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ideas that look terrible on paper are quite often terrible in practice, and <i>Catch the Throne</i>’s ace conceit, to lure people of color to <i>Game of Thrones </i>with rap music, is executed about as poorly as one could expect. The writing is leagues beneath everyone involved, and the sequencing is nonsensical to a hilarious degree. But beyond that, the notion that a mixtape is a sensible means to boost <i>Game of Thrones</i>’ sinking black and Latin viewership is misguided, if not insulting. If HBO is really interested in expanding into different households it might want to consider presenting people of color in a more complimentary light on the show. Fishing for diversity with a mixtape when the desired audiences are only seen in the series as slaves, savages, thieves and bargaining chips is covering a stab wound with a band-aid. <i>Game of Thrones </i>has problems no amount of hip-hop star power can fix, and <i>Catch the Throne</i> has given back very little in return for the urban cred it’s been loaned here. One can only hope everyone involved caught a princely check for their troubles.</p></div>"|19140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19140-catch-the-throne-the-mixtape/|4.0|Craig Jenkins

To scan the liner notes of Current 93’s past is to see a roster of remarkable talents and controversial figures, each worthy of their own lengthy explorations: Crass’ Steve Ignorant and Coil’s Jhonn Balance, folk queen Shirley Collins and ambient demigod William Basinski, regulars Steven Stapleton and Andrew Liles, the mesmeric singers Antony Hegarty and Rickie Lee Jones. Tibet has been an unapologetic Svengali, bending these incredible casts to his alternating will of atmospheric neo-folk or apocalyptic rock symphonies, refined industrial cacophony or delicate chamber maneuvers.</p>
<p>There’s endemic payoff and peril with such an arrangement, of course. That rotation has long seemed to energize Tibet, forcing him to reconfigure his explorations of ancient religion and modern life with for nearly every new outing. Tibet’s music remains intriguingly unpredictable, then, a wide catalog bound mostly by the thread of his serpent’s tongue and high-minded conceits. On the other hand, some crews of Current 93 have simply worked better than others. Many have afforded his material surprising depth, while others have seemed shallow when pitted against his idiosyncratic charge. So it goes for the capable assemblage of <i>I Am the Last of All the Field that Fell</i>, an 11-song album that not only re-taps Hegarty, Liles, Nick Cave, and guitarist James Blackshaw (relegated to bass this time) but adds John Zorn and boundary-pressing Dutch classical pianist Reinier van Houdt. And that’s but a partial sample. There are flutes and poetry readings, floods of noise and wisps of bass clarinet. Still, such an astounding lineup only serves to reinforce the disappointment of the flat and oftentimes gangly <i>Field</i>.</p>
<p>Tibet’s voice does not easily fit many definitions. It is a sharp, brittle instrument that works best in starts and stops, when it can leap beneath and through musical phrases with the authority reserved only for a bandleader. But on <i>Field</i>, Tibet’s only consistent accompaniment is van Houdt’s versatile piano playing. Together, they navigate peppy burlesque numbers and lurking acid rock, demented freak-jazz and drooping torch songs, various members joining in or dropping out. He attempts to slip his uniquely shaped vocals into too many unyielding holes. These torrents of words—references to Akkadian grammar and forgotten gods, cigarettes and hipsters, delivered no less in several languages—lash against the sides of the songs van Houdt attempts to shape. The most awkward fits even become unintentionally hilarious. Late during “Kings and Things”, Tibet steps sprightly over piano and a distortion-pedal din, his voice chased by the fair air of Comus’ Bobbie Watson. He offers phrases like “Announcing Japanese beheading,” and she stays in his thrall. It sounds <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3wd7s_C5GU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like an action scene from <i>Cats</i></a>, while its successor—the piano-and-voice soliloquy ""With the Dromedaries""—sounds like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-L6rEm0rnY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the dark-night confessional</a> that might chase it on a Broadway stage. “Let’s discuss denim/ or the weather/ of my dead friends,” he sings, doing his best to constrain himself to the small valleys between van Houdt’s cresting-and-collapsing notes. Above the tightly scripted full-jazz-band motion of “Spring Sandy Dream Larks”, Tibet seems truly lost for one of the first times in his career. It’s as if he’s wandered uninvited into a rehearsal by the Bad Plus and tried to shoehorn his voice—shouts of Aleph and all—into a tune written without him. Dejected, he takes his leave nearly a minute before they’re done. </p>
<p>But the band isn’t so much the problem as the directions they generally take, a point epitomized by the brazen and vitriolic “And Onto NickPick Magick”. The outfit starts in a pre-lit smolder, with snarling electric guitar and teasing flute lashing out against van Houdt’s dissonant piano and Tibet’s deep speak-sing. The group suggests a conflagration spiraling upward through space: The piano lines pile high. The guitar tone grows more reckless. The bass maintains its constant thump but gets louder and more anxious, a pulse quickened by the knowledge of impending doom. By the song’s paroxysmal end, Tibet cries every line, his stentorian tone now liquefied into terror. “I could not find your lips in the songs of bees, in ForgetMeNot Fields,” he screams during one of the album’s most lucid, poignant, and harrowing moments. That sensation emerges toward the end of “Those Flowers Grow”, too, when Tibet’s clinched screams, Zorn’s saxophone squawks, and Tony McPhee’s guitar lock into a three-way war. It’s one of <i>Field</i>’s few moments of full-band power that still finds Tibet in rightful control.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, Tibet also succeeds when he sets up a system and lets it advance without him. On 2006’s <i>Black Ships Ate the Sky</i>, for instance, he gave his nightmares ballast and balance by allowing a set of premier singers—Hegarty, Bonnie “Prince” Billy, Marc Almond—to deliver the 18th century hymn “Idumæa” separately. It stunned. And he wrote the lyrics for the 2007 Michael Cashmore EP <i>The Snow Abides</i>, again voiced by Hegarty; it’s one of the most remarkable moments in any of their careers. On <i>Field</i>, a choir of monastic hums backs Hegarty, gliding through Tibet’s interconnected lyrics with ease. Tibet tries the same thing by himself two songs later, and the contrast crystallizes their differing skill sets. At least the record ends with “I Could Not Shift the Shadow”, a perfect duet between Cave's husky voice and fluttering harmonies, sunlight and shadow, fire and ash. “And bare your naked church into my mouth,” he repeats at the end, pushing off with the sort of steady resolve that so much of <i>Field</i> misses. It’s a parting reminder that this is Current 93, and to date, the magic has always returned.</p></div>"|18924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18924-current-93-i-am-the-last-of-all-the-field-that-fell-a-channel/|5.1|Grayson Haver Currin

To play in Offenders, he would have had to. Rounded out by bassist Mikey Offender (née Donaldson, who died in 2007) and singer J.J. Jacobson, the lineup of Offenders during its 80s prime was as anguish-trawling as any in hardcore. Of all the historic punk and HC bands based in Austin in the early 80s—MDC, D.R.I., the Big Boys, and the Dicks foremost among them—Offenders remain the least celebrated or even recognized, despite the fact that Johnson was a founding member of MDC (when they were still called the Stains) and Donaldson played on D.R.I.’s seminal 1985 album <i>Dealing With It</i>. Offenders have always belonged on that top tier. No amount of revisionist oversight can blunt the brute impact of their discography, particularly their two full-lengths, 1983’s <i>We Must Rebel</i> and 1985’s <i>Endless Struggle</i>, as well as their 1984 7” “I Hate Myself”/“Bad Times”. In an effort to help rectify this blind spot, these three releases have been collected in full by Southern Lord as a double-LP anthology including beefed-up fidelity. Not that these songs have ever sounded less than staggeringly savage.</p>
<p>The discography of Offenders has never been that difficult to find.

With hardcore hitting another upswing in its perennial cycle, though, the timing of <i>We Must Rebel/I Hate Myself/Endless Struggle </i>couldn’t be better.

That future included a plan of attack that, up to that point, had been antithetical to hardcore: heavy metal. On the album’s first track, “Fight Back”, a new tone is instantly set with a shadow-steeped arpeggio that would have sounded at home on another record released that year, Metallica’s <i>Kill ’Em All</i>. But unlike the proto-crossover of Void’s half of the 1982’s <i>The </i><i>Faith/Void</i> split album, <i>We Must Rebel</i> isn’t sloppy or chaotic. It’s tightly wound and inhumanly focused, even when Doyle’s drumming on “No Chance” feels like it’s about to catapult itself into insensibility, or when Johnson’s riffs on “New Militia” are applied like surgical implements.</p>
<p>The between-albums single, “I Hate Myself / Bad Times”, is rawer than either full-length, which only renders the abusive self-loathing of the former into a hackle-raising cry of elemental hurt. Jacobson’s vocals hint at another D.C. hardcore influence besides Void—namely Minor Threat’s Ian MacKaye—but in Jacobson’s throat that barking roar is less accusatory than confessional. Along with Offenders as a whole, he hits his personal best on <i>Endless Struggle</i>. “On the Crooked Edge” jabs gaping holes in itself, leaving space for Johnson and Jacobson to hang in—that is, before Johnson’s plugs the holes with squealing snarls of guitar-solo anarchy worthy of Void’s Bubba Dupree. “Endless Struggle” earnestly sports an epic, organ-laden, Deep Purple-esque intro at a time when <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dNM-oVNYe0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Day Glo Abortions were making fun</a> of that exact same sound. But it’s the opening salvo of “You Got a Right” and “Face Down in the Dirt” that marks the anthology’s peak. Less than three minutes combined, the pair of tracks spans the band’s own spectrum: The latter is a scathing rebuke of abuse that pukes up battery acid and a palpable stench of degradation, while the former is a glacial, churning, bleakly anthemic grind that sounds like a primitive ancestor of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrZzzlrS7LU&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Owner’s Lament”</a>, the legendary Scratch Acid song that appeared a year later on Rabid Cat, the same Austin label that released <i>Endless Struggle</i>. Slow and choked with sludge, “You Got a Right” marks a turning point in hardcore—a song-length breakdown that offers no respite, and a omen of the grunge and pigfuck crawl that was just around the corner. As if to punctuate that pivotal nature, Offenders’ cover of the Supremes’ “You Keep Me Hangin’ On”—or rather, Offenders’ cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwfW9WwIXLk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vanilla Fudge’s version</a> of the song—concludes <i>Endless Struggle</i> on a bitter, bludgeoning note that carves a straight line between the proto-metal of the past and the shape of post-hardcore to come.</p>

In the mid-90s, the guitarist first appeared as a Keith Richardsian foil to the jacked-up Jaggerisms of vocalist Timmy Taylor in Dayton, Ohio berserkers Brainiac. After Taylor’s death in a car crash in 1997 brought that band to a sudden end just as they were about to record their big-league debut for Interscope, Schmersal resurfaced as a charismatic frontman in his own right with Enon, the Brooklyn-based outfit that released four inspired but unheralded albums of electro-shocked pop before dissolving in 2010. Around the same time, Schmersal settled into the steadiest gig a 90s freak-scene vet could hope for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53912-fred-armisen-will-be-the-late-night-with-seth-meyers-bandleader/"" target=""_blank"">this side of the Seth Meyers Band</a>, as a touring guitarist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>. But even though it’s a gig that's allowed him to tour further afield and play for larger crowds than he’s ever experienced before, Schmersal is too restless an artist to remain completely beholden to someone else’s vision and timetable.</p>
<p>Since moving to L.A. in 2010, he’s put together two new, very different bands that isolate each half of the pop/slop symbiosis that’s always fuelled his work. To satisfy his penchant for bizarro psych-funk, he’s got Crooks on Tape, a reunion with former Enonite/Skeleton Key clanger Rick Lee. And to unleash his inner melody-maker, he has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31894-vertical-scratchers/"" target=""_blank"">Vertical Scratchers</a>, a house party­-forged partnership with drummer Christian Beaulieu of San Fran prog-punk mutants Triclops! and collaborative psych-folk project Anywhere. Given the divergent interests and ping-ponging aesthetics of both parties involved, what’s most remarkable about Vertical Scratchers is its determinedly narrow ethos. Though it has an antecedent in Schermsal’s one-off lo-fi 1998 solo release as John Stuart Mill, it’s by far the most classicist band either principal has been involved in to date. Over the course of this 15-song, 30-minute blur of a debut record, the duo mine a post-Beatles power-pop lineage that connects <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fINpWTj-Bw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the byzantine logic of the Lilys</a> (“Turn Me Out”), <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXgLzlRJRYI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the hazy harmonies and easy-going groove of early Sloan</a> (“Someone”), and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f76GsOBxUg0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Vaselines-smeared side of pre-<i>Nevermind</i> Nirvana</a> (“Wait No Longer”), yielding a bounty of<b> </b>jagged, 120-second song shards that would make Schmersal’s old Dayton pal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Pollard</a> proud. And when Pollard actually turns up for a guest vocal turn on the zippy “Get Along With U,” the fit is so natural you almost don’t notice his appearance at first.</p>
<p>But appropriately enough for a record that was recorded in L.A. punk pit The Smell, <i>Daughter of Everything</i> doesn’t so much recapture a golden age of pop as exhume it, presenting pretty melodies beset by dust, decay, and stinking rot. The name Vertical Scratchers isn’t some random, cheeky nod to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zElSlSdL4MM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infomercial-hawked itch-relieving implements</a>, but a vivid descriptor of <i>Daughter of Everything</i>’s rusted-out sound: Many of the songs feature Schmersal scraping away on an unplugged electric guitar, and on tumbling tracks like the Kinks-kicked “Way Out”, the clipped effect of his speedy strums is so pronounced, it’s almost as if the band has two percussionists. It’s an approach than can grow a little wearing, particularly in those moments (see: “Chambermaids,” “Kingdom Come”) when Schmersal’s silly-putty voice loses its grip on his ceaselessly shifting melodies and gets lost in the clamor. But Vertical Scratchers are wise to trip the album’s breakneck pace with strategically placed balladic breathers, and these slow-motion anomalies—like the beautifully woozy “Pretend U Are Free,” the subtly anthemic “U Dug Us All,” or the stoner-folk reverie “Rainbows”—result in the album’s most illuminating, savoury moments, showcasing the duo’s savvy songcraft while resisting the urge to scuff it up. <i>Daughters of Everything</i> is rock‘n’roll rendered on Etch A Sketch: imperfect and monochromatic to be sure, but infectiously playful, and liable to spin off into any direction at any moment. And, occasionally, you find yourself marveling at an accidental masterpiece. </p></div>"|19127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19127-vertical-scratchers-daughter-of-everything/|7.2|Stuart Berman

For the past decade, Drew’s work as a solo artist and with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"">Broken Social Scene</a> has dealt in sex, drugs, politics, and the politics of druggy sex, and though he’s clearly been deposed as the T. Dot’s resident superfreak, <i>Darlings</i> finds him going down swinging. Here are three of its first four songs: “Body Butter”; “Good Sex”; “Mexican Aftershow Party”. And those titles are not placeholders—more like truth in advertising, headlines teasing stories about Drew after dark.</p>
<p>As with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18575-brendan-canning-you-gots-2-chill/"">most recent record </a>by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8055-brendan-canning"">Brendan Canning</a>, the “Broken Social Scene Presents…” appellation has been dropped from Drew’s second go-round. Once it made sense. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10676-spirit-if/"">Spirit If…</a></i>from 2007 was basically a Drew-centric Broken Social Scene album—shaggy and communal, it served as a passageway between <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/955-broken-social-scene/"">Broken Social Scene</a></i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14200-forgiveness-rock-record/""><i>Forgiveness Rock Record</i></a>. <i>Darlings</i>—sometimes orchestral, and prone to slow-burning torch songs—never feels like a “band” record. That’s partly due to the synth-heavy arrangements, where guitars play only a supporting role. The electronics don’t make <i>Darlings</i> a particularly <i>modernist</i> record, but the album does have a strange timeliness. As with the most recent releases from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17523-regions-of-light-and-sound-of-god/"">Jim James</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17800-devendra-banhart-mala/"">Devendra Banhart</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18447-volcano-choir-repave"">Volcano Choir</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18961-wild-beasts-present-tense"">Wild Beasts</a>, there seems to be a trend of aging men gravitating towards a sound where guitars no longer convey their inner lusts and desires.</p>
<p>Still, you wouldn’t call it “synth-pop,” any more than you would Bruce Springsteen’s <i>Tunnel of Love</i>, an album that serves as a spiritual forebear for albums like <i>Darlings<i>. </i></i>Its more muted character makes a case for Drew as one of indie rock’s most subtly distinctive vocalists. His tone doesn’t lend itself to descriptive terms, but four years after<i><i> <i>Forgiveness Rock Record</i>,</i></i> it’s striking how instantly familiar Drew can sound even in this newly sleek context, thanks to a cadence that riffs on ragged melodies just a little behind the beat.</p>
<p>This works in <i>Darlings</i>’ favor, particularly when Drew’s voice is all you can hang onto. He has a knack for lyrics that are both explicit and obtuse, words that are overly blunt and vague at the same time. “You Gotta Feel It” and “You Got Caught” both repeat a stock phrase ad nauseam to bind ambiguous lines, while “Bullshit Ballad” is every bit the empty salvo it criticizes. The latter’s steady chug bears a striking resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire"">Arcade Fire</a>’s “Keep the Car Running”, though I doubt it’s aimed in their direction. More likely, it’s aimed at no one in particular, and the non-specificity of lines like “Your soul was distracted/ And your vocals were too high…your horrible whining” renders it the only time where <i>Darlings</i> is well, pretty limp.</p>
<p>But “Bullshit Ballad” is more of a curious fit than a weak song; the rest of <i>Darlings</i> lays out what Drew considers to be ballads free of bullshit. The album is often just as expansive as Broken Social Scene, though spreading outwards rather than shooting upwards and collapsing—its struggles are wholly internal rather than external. On “Body Butter”, Drew wants to party all alone, and yet he allows his date to the Mexican aftershow party to claim him as hers only because “I don’t wanna fight with the man that I am.” You get a good sense of just what kind of man Drew is on <i>Darlings</i>, reconciling monogamy with promiscuity, Broken Social Scene’s cheap-seats bombast with love-seat confidentiality.</p></div>"|19114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19114-kevin-drew-darlings/|7.6|Ian Cohen

The lyrics, like so many others by the Atlanta punks, are aggressive: ""You said I broke your heart and you’ll never love again/ Let’s tell the truth you only like the way I give head."" Then, the full band screams along the chorus: ""Well grow up, and then shut the fuck up!"" Seven years later, on <i>Suck My Shirt</i>, they've got a song on the album called, simply, ""Shut Up"". The message here is more grown up—the narrator is fed up after years of being lied to, whined at, and blamed. And this time around, the band are firing on all cylinders—the drums sound more full, the guitars more complex, and the vocals are sung rather than growled or screamed. ""Shut up,"" they sing repeatedly at the chorus, more out of frustration than vindictiveness.</p>
<p>No longer peddling the candy-coated vigor of ""Stop Stomp Stompin'"" or the intense, Nina Hagen-esque vocal delivery of ""Johnny"",<i> Suck My Shirt </i>shows a band continuing to grow and refine their sound. Have they become more tame as they've become a tighter band? Hell no. Their instruments still bite and their vocals still growl. But this time, the subject matter feels weightier. Several songs have the band addressing the harsh realities of love and relationships (""I know it's hard to love me,"" bellows Stephanie Luke on ""Love Em and Leave Em""), all while delivering some of the best performances in their discography.</p>
<p>Four tracks that recently appeared on <a href=""http://suicidesqueezerecords.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Suicide Squeeze</a> singles, reworked for the album, are all performed with urgency and power. ""Smother"" is a persistent burner with an infectious chorus about needing space. ""Adderall"", one of the best-constructed songs of the album with its subtle harmonies and calm-before-the-storm chorus, is about deception. You can detect a hint of sorrow in Luke's vocals on ""Derek's Song"", a requiem for their fallen friend Derek Shepherd, but it's offset by the track's opening power chords. Then there's ""Merry Go Round"", one of the album's undeniable highlights, and describing the ""he tricks her, she tricks him"" plot isn't nearly as interesting as the earworm chorus: ""I'll have some fun on the merry go round,/ I'll get real high on the merry go round..."".</p>
<p>The only snag along the way has to do with the length of their songs. Album opener ""Follow Me"" has a melody that's immediate and lyrics that're both aggressive and playful, but it's a song that goes for a largely unvarying four minutes. Before they even find the second minute, they're repeating the lengthy-on-its-own first verse again. Why? It's a punk song with momentum, but it's stretched too thin. Other songs start slow—""Love Em and Leave Em"", for example, which opens with a trudge. But that track is also an example of one of the Coathangers' greatest strengths: They've become adept proprietors of ""the drop."" Right as the chorus hits, there's a pause, and then they launch into a breakneck chorus. It's even more satisfying one track later, on ""Zombie"", because it's completely unexpected. The track comes to a full stop. Then a wall of frenzied guitars, fingers shoved to the bottom of the fretboard, an atmosphere that's sudden and dire.</p>
<p>There's plenty of ire on <i>Suck My Shirt</i>, but the album's real stunner is ""Drive"", which isn't angry at all. Their warm, gentle power pop guitars close the album, and the narrator sings with a sense of longing. She's waiting for someone special to come home; it's been too long. ""But you,"" she sings, pausing—maybe the pause is there so the verse can fit in the confines of the song's structure, but it's just as likely that the truth at hand is too painful for the full sentence to come out at once. ""You drive away from me."" She says she'll stop waiting around for him, but as the chorus hits and she sings ""so long, my love,"" it feels bittersweet. It's a relatable sentiment in a beautiful song. Somehow, on an album called <i>Suck My Shirt</i>, the Coathangers manage to have it all. It's well-recorded, well-written, and teeming with both force and emotional depth.</p></div>"|19119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19119-the-coathangers-suck-my-shirt/|7.2|Evan Minsker

The release combined two obscure albums from the prior decade, 1982’s <i>Whichever Way You Are Going, You Are Going Wrong</i> and 1989’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17263-its-cosy-inside/"" target=""_blank""><i>It’s Cosy Inside</i></a>, and the CD’s hand-written blurb referenced Cluster and Durutti Column. The discs were still housed in those long plastic clamshells, relics of a bygone era, which was fitting: In both intent and sensibility, Woo are also are relics of another time, or perhaps just displaced from spacetime.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Woo’s obscurity has lessened slightly, with Drag City reissuing <i>It’s Cosy Inside</i> and the UK imprint Emotional Rescue last year reissuing <i>Whichever </i>(they'll also reissue <i>Into </i><i>the Heart of Love</i> later this year).<i> </i>Hearing <i>When the Past Arrives</i> as a “new” Woo album or a collection of previously unheard archival material feels beside the point, as Woo music always drifts just beyond the tangible. It’s ambient and gentle as new age music of that era could be, but it’s also densely melodic and playful—their peculiar British sensibilities shine through, cosmic and serene yet also very droll.</p>
<p><i>Past</i> moves between shimmering miniatures (half the tracks clock in under 2:30) and slightly longer ruminations that last just over three minutes, like the acoustic guitar-led “Acting Like a Lover”. The charming “1001 Decisions” has a cello that sounds like it’s submerged in a children’s pool, the bowed melody broken up by what could be little bits of a ringing toy telephone, theremin, and tiny xylophone. Elsewhere, there’s a little ditty wherein the brothers and a lady friend coo the question: “How far will you go today/ Up the garden path?” Woo do merit comparison to the likes of Cluster and Durutti Column but it’s easy to imagine that those are not the Ives’ brothers exact reference points. They sound like Durutti Column as rendered on ukulele, or Cluster if instead of amassing early synthesizers they instead collected clarinets, kazoos and other woodwinds. (In one interview, they <a href=""http://www.theransomnote.co.uk/label-to-artist-woo-interviewed-by-emotional-rescue/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talk about growing up with Dixieland jazz</a>.)</p>
<p><i>When the Past Arrives</i>’ centerpiece is the elegant nine-minute piece, “Satya”. What sounds like gentle bits of electronic fuzz reveals itself to be buzzing clarinets and curlicues of guitar. There’s also a drone as gentle as a rubbed wineglass. It’s vintage Woo. Or perhaps it’s recent Woo? Or maybe it’s just the sonic embodiment of that Sanskrit word “satya,” which loosely translates as “unchangeable” and “that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person.”</p></div>"|19115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19115-woo-when-the-past-arrives/|7.7|Andy Beta

For Plessow, better known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28724-motor-city-drum-ensemble/"">Motor City Drum Ensemble</a>, it represents the first significant dump of new material since his wildly popular <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14053-raw-cuts-vol-1/"">Raw Cuts</a> series—dusty, sample-based house ravers—put him on the map at the end of last decade. The album, a collection of percolating synthesizer landscapes, represents a new direction for both, one that borrows from Germany's storied history of outre music in both form—the influence of artists like Popol Vuh and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8800-hans-joachim-roedelius/"">Hans-Joachim Roedelius</a> is undeniable—and function: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>'s Jaki Liebezeit guests on drums.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite its relative obscurity in the canon of western music, instrumental synthesizer music is plentiful. Analog circuitry is enormously fun to fiddle with and gear obsessives have a tendency to hit ""record"" and do just that. Artists such as Steve Moore, Norm Chambers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29786-jurgen-muller/"">Jürgen Müller</a>, Panabrite), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29955-steve-hauschildt/"">Steve Hauschildt</a>, and Jorge Velez (Professor Genius) are just a handful of artists who've released exciting works in the genre recently. This is music that sits in the middle of a venn diagram that brings together ambient, improvisatory, and generative musics, which is to say that it's music that can often seem more edifying and enriching for its creators than for its audience. <i>Vermont</i>'s careful, patient compositions don't feel particularly generative or improvisatory, but the instruments still do a lot of the heavy lifting: anyone not predisposed to enveloping pads and wispy filigrees of melody will find little else to sink their teeth into.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If Plessow and Worgull distinguish themselves, it's via clarity and execution. Because its creators are often using finicky gear three and four decades old, lots of synthesizer music tends to sound as worn and fractured as the tools used to make it. <i>Vermont</i>, though, is focused and luminous; its high is similar to that of waking up early, totally sober, and gathering oneself. There's discipline and fidelity in this music, which is a fancy way of saying it has its shit together. <i>Vermont</i> is never less than agreeable and pretty: if you get off on hearing a bunch of volts and circuits evoke mountains and fog, <i>Vermont</i> might be for you.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Evoking those landscapes, though, is all <i>Vermont</i> does. It's polite music that, unlike proper ambient music, has pretensions that extend beyond politeness. It's here where <i>Vermont</i>'s balance hurts it. Something foggier or more random would open more avenues to explore, but <i>Vermont</i> feels complete, without mystery or intrigue. It lacks the psychedelia and stoned otherness of its inspirations. ""Macchina""'s puddled rhythms and ""Ruckzug""'s graceful plumes are lovely, but oddity and intrigue are beyond their grasp. ""Cocos"" is a moody, minor-key sea of texture, but it never stirs up any real tension.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To its credit, <i>Vermont</i> stares its self-imposed limits in the face and walks away with plenty of elegant moments. Its slightness makes it nothing more than a diversion: for listeners, sure, but also for its creators. <i>Vermont</i> is a side project that sounds like one, a pastime for Plessow and Worgull, a minor curiosity for their fans.</p></div>"|19129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19129-vermont-vermont/|6.4|Andrew Gaerig

She hauled her instruments and equipment out into the English countryside, where she recorded herself performing songs on overcast beaches, in deep woods, or in sunny fields. As she told the <a href=""http://www.thefourohfive.com/news/article/how-i-wrote-lyla-foy-talks-about-her-album-mirrors-in-the-sky?utm_content=bufferb3869&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">405</a> recently, “One of my trips took me up to the Lake District, and another to the blustery coast of Cornwall, during a storm. There are birds and goats to be heard all over the recordings, if you listen closely.” Returning to London, she convened with her bandmates to touch up the recordings with keyboards, drums, and vocals, working to complement the rustic demos while preserving their airy minimalism.</p>
<p>The result might be best described as a digital pastoral: sequences and synthesizers blending with live instruments to create the kind of introverted, outdoorsy reverie most commonly associated with acoustic folk. Foy’s songs are both lush and low-key, intimate and surprisingly intricate. She layers beats generously but carefully, alternating between buoyant (“I Only”, with its percolating intro) and bittersweet (“Only Human”, with its insistent snare tap). Except on the relatively aerodynamic “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16475-feather-tongue/"">Feather Tongue</a>”, which could easily be remixed into a throbbing dance number suitable for a meadow rave, Foy’s concern isn’t rhythm but texture and tapestry. The tempos are generally slow and rigid, which  fits the general atmosphere of the record and gives you a better opportunity to admire her craft.</p>
<p>Given the various geographies that contributed to these songs, the mood on <i>Mirrors the Sky</i> can be too narrow. When it changes, it moves from gloomy to gloomier, especially on “Rumour”, which trudges along on the glummest reggae-dirge beat imaginable. And yet, Foy peppers these songs with enough flourishes to prevent the album from becoming too predictable or claustrophobic. She has an ear for ambient noise: It sounds like someone’s rubbing a balloon on “Only I” and who knows what that din is on “No Secrets”? Car keys nervously jangled in a coat pocket? Billiard balls being ground into dust? That the source of the sound is never clear only makes it more ominous.</p>
<p>Over this burbling electronic folk music, Foy writes impressionistic lyrics that prove more inquisitive than confessional, and she sings in a robust and expressive whisper, as though she’s letting the listener eavesdrop on a private, unself-conscious moment. Yet, her truest gift may be for writing dreamy, shimmery, extremely catchy hooks that lift these songs out of their depths. Her songs measure the distance between lovers and document her attempts to either erase or create that space. “Am I allowed to love you yet?” she asks on “No Secrets"". She doesn’t sound angry or hurt; that line isn’t rhetorical or accusatory. Instead, she sounds like she’s lamenting so many lost opportunities for happiness.</p>
<p><i>Mirrors the Sky</i> is actually Foy’s first release under her own name, after playing for a few years under the pseudonym <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30899-wall/"">WALL</a>. Under that guise she was routinely compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">the xx</a> for her downcast gothicisms, but these new songs have more in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"">Vashti Bunyan</a>, <a href=""http://www.sibyllebaier.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sibylle Baier</a>, and other otherworldly folk artists. (Foy even covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5009-karen-dalton/"">Karen Dalton</a>’s “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14604-something-on-your-mind-karen-dalton-cover/"">Something on Your Mind</a>” during her WALL days.) It’s apt that she tore down the WALL, with all its misleading Pink Floyd associations, for this album: <i>Mirrors the Sky</i> reflects a subtle yet effective refinement of her sound, as she tweaks these elements and influences to create music that is both familiar and idiosyncratic. </p></div>"|19134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19134-lyla-foy-mirrors-the-sky/|7.3|Stephen M.

If the mesmerizing motorik hum of <i>Slave Ambient</i> gave Granduciel an outlet to escape his problems, <i>Lost in the Dream</i> is where he pulls a U to survey the emotional wreckage. While his former War on Drugs compadre Kurt Vile is forever <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17851-kurt-vile-wakin-on-a-pretty-daze/"" target=""_blank""><i>Waking on a Pretty Daze</i></a>, Granduciel has been sleepless through some ugly nights.</p>
<p>As detailed in a <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-war-on-drugs-gets-ready-to-play-the-big-rooms/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent Grantland feature</a>, <i>Lost In the Dream</i> was the product of a grueling, year-long recording process. Though Granduciel involved his touring band more so than any previous War on Drugs record, his perfectionist tendencies still held sway, resulting in endless cycles of recording, revising, and scrapping. And such self-doubt wasn’t helped by the fact that Granduciel was recovering from the flame-out of a long-term relationship, the ashes of which are scattered all over his lyric sheet here. But the obsessiveness and insecurity pay off massively on <i>Lost in the Dream</i>—this is the War on Drugs’ most lustrous, intricately detailed, and beautifully rendered record to date. In essence, the War on Drugs have evolved as a band on an album-to-album basis in precisely the same fashion as so many of their songs: what at first seemed like a fairly straightforward, traditionalist roots-rock exercise has very gradually, very subtly blossomed into something wondrous and profound.</p>
<p><i>Lost in the Dream</i> continues down the <i>Slave Ambient</i> route of bridging polar-opposite strains of 1980s rock—namely, the tremulous haze of late-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a> and the sort of flyover-state Americana anthems used to sell pick-up trucks. But even in the album’s opening seconds, the new album asserts itself as a more urgent affair—overtop the blurry, break-of-dawn guitar ripples of “Under the Pressure”, a stuttering drum machine sounds off like an alarm clock coaxing you out of bed and prodding you out the door. And if the steady-pulsed melody that emerges initially positions “Under the Pressure” as the most placid song about anxiety ever, by the third chorus run—at which point it’s amassed a swirl of dueling guitar solos, starburst synths, and brown-note saxophone swells—you feel the full weight of this nine-minute track bearing down on your chest.</p>
<p>This tension is inescapable. Whether it’s the hair-raising, Autobahn-blazing charge of “An Ocean In Between the Waves” or the Positively <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Street_%28Philadelphia%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">South Street</a> sway of “Eyes of the Wind”, Granduciel’s litany of worries are laid bare here, free of any textural interference or obfuscation. And the comparatively direct lyrics mirror the new approach to incorporating some of Granduciel’s more unfashionable influences. As ever, totemic figures like Dylan and Springsteen cast a long shadow over the War on Drugs’ terrain, but Granduciel is the sort of classic-rock purist who wore out the grooves of those artists’ most canonical albums so long ago that he now finds fresher inspiration in their less lauded 80s discography.</p>
<p>Period sounds abound: “Red Eyes” is what would happen if Springteen’s simmering “I’m on Fire” was actually set aflame; “Burning” finds its fuse in the buoyant keyboard riff to Rod Stewart’s 1981 new-wave novelty “Young Turks”; the melancholic mid-album meditation “Disappearing” sounds like the synth-powered rhythm track of Tears for Fears’ “Pale Shelter” on a codeine drip. And the preponderance of glistening piano chords on this record suggests Granduciel is not one to touch his dial whenever Bruce Hornsby’s “The Way It Is” pops up on his local oldies station.</p>
<p>But if <i>Lost in the Dream</i> is unapologetic in its dad-rock reverence, it’s dad-rock for people who are too fucked up and broken to even think of having kids. (As he sings on “The Ocean In Between the Waves”: “I’m in my finest hour/ Can I be more than just a fool?”) In sharp contrast to, say, <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/built-to-spill-cover-jokerman-for-bob-dylan-tribute-song-premiere-20140122"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent efforts to liberate Dylan’s 80s output from its dated production</a>, Granduciel’s songs are left to fidget and squirm within the claustrophobic sonic confines and synthetic sheen. In his hands, these echoes of the past ultimately emphasize the uncertainty of his future, those shiny surfaces representing the good life that seems forever out of reach.</p>
<p>And besides, on <i>Lost in the Dream</i>, the most crucial details are found in its structural mutations. The album is loaded with songs whose greatness is revealed slowly, where the simplest, most understated chord change can blow a track wide open and elevate it from simply pretty to absolutely devastating. Note the shift that occurs two minutes and 50 seconds into “Suffering”, where the pent-up despondency heard in Granduciel’s state-of-his-union address (“Why we here when we’re both gonna fake it?”) is unleashed in a crying jag of drizzling piano chords and gently weeping White Album-like guitar slides. Or in the midst of the album’s epic break-up-ballad finale, “In Reverse”,­ you realize that all of the angst and ache that went into the song, and the album’s creation as a whole, is just building to the moment of release provided by the big, shoulder rub of an acoustic-guitar riff that appears out of nowhere at the 5:13 mark. They’re the sort of perfect little touches that effectively translate Granduciel’s private hurt into communal catharsis—and reify <i>Lost in the Dream</i> as an immaculately assembled portrait of a man falling apart.</p></div>"|19094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19094-the-war-on-drugs-lost-in-the-dream/|8.8|Stuart Berman

The timing makes sense. His first two albums took place there, both of which went gold. Now that he's drifted away permanently from the G.O.O.D. Music axis, a return voyage probably seems appealling. The first track, ""Destination: Mother Moon"" sets the course—it opens on a horizon-blotting synth panning overhead, and it conjures some genuine fear and awe (Cudi's always been good with synthesizers). But the instrumental bleeds quickly into the first full track, ""Going to the Ceremony"", and, inevitably, Cudi shows up. On the chorus, he intones ""I""m going ... <i>It's. All. Happening,""</i>, suggesting that your only companion on this lunar vessel is a hyped-up mid-level marketing associate.</p>
<p>The moment is the Kid CuDi catalog in miniature: A vast, serene, often-beautiful vista of sounds —and then <i>this guy</i>, standing right in front of them. Kid Cudi has been standing in front of his own music ever since his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13504-man-on-the-moon-the-end-of-day/"" target=""_blank"">2009 debut</a>, doing whatever he can to distract you from his genuine talents: a composer's ear for atmosphere, a professional producer's taste in tone colors. His lyrics, however, remain darts thrown at a barn door. ""You're such an adult, pay all your bills, yet you are a zombie,"" he sings on ""Going to the Ceremony"". His singing is ruthlessly flat, and his melodies doodle noncommitally around the same three-note melody he's been humming ever since ""Day N Nite"". His go-to cadence as a rapper is more ""Adam Sandler imitating a rapper"" than ""rapper."" These traits were hard to ignore when he showed up, and he's done absolutely nothing to minimize them in the interim. </p>
<p>Of all these issues, his lack of melodic imagination as a singer is the most damning and difficult to get around. He sabotages almost any track he breathes on. The synths on ""Too Bad I Have To Destroy You"" sparkle  like light on water, little off-beat accents coursing beneath and piano notes providing the bass line. It's a smooth, exhilarating piece of music, but Cudi defaces it, stuttering and tum-de-tum-tumming all over it, like an eighth-grader who wondered into the unattended studio and left his own vocal track just for laughs. Pick any track: on ""Internal Bleeding"", he assumes a mush-mouth delivery that might be a stab at dramatizing the condition in the song title. Maybe we're supposed to imagine this guy singing on the floor with a mouth full of broken teeth? At any rate, the music tumbles down around him like a drunk grabbing onto a curtain rod.</p>
<p>To navigate successfully around a Kid Cudi album, then, is to get really good at squinting at the periphery. A lovely little piano figure here, a sonar blip traveling through the mix there. Mercifully, <i>SATELLITE FLIGHT</i> ups the ratio on instrumentals to Cudi tracks, and they are, to a degree that is near-comical, the best and most listenable pieces of music CuDi's ever released as a solo artist. ""Return of the Moon Man"" blends a chugging string quartet figure with mournful reverb'ed guitar, while Imperial March horns—notably similar <i>to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank"">Yeezus</a></i>'s ""Blood on the Leaves"" —blare overhead. It could almost have snuck onto the last Fuck Buttons album and gone unspotted. ""Copernicus Landing"" is a calm, glowing maze of New Age synths, the sound of machines chattering quietly to each other. Crucially, Cudi never utter a word.</p>
<p>Something surprising happens at the eleventh hour of <i>SATELLITE FLIGHT</i>, however, and it bears mentioning. The sci-fi synths drop away, as does the dead-eyed chest-puffing. Cudi sings—sweetly, modestly, and <i>in tune</i>—over nothing but some guitar, finger-picked with athe level of skill that suggests a deep study of Green Day's ""All By Myself"". The song is just two chords, but the voicing is haunting, and as Cudi hums to himself a sweet little melody, he instantly transforms into another possible version of himself: an indie-pop sad-sack troubador, recording on a bed strewn with K Records 7-inches. It's an unlikely sight, but it's a glimpse of the guy that's never quite made it onto a Kid Cudi record before. May his next record consist entirely of sci-fi instrumentals, or anti-folk ditties, or both. </p></div>"|19133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19133-kid-cudi-satellite-flight-the-journey-to-mother-moon/|6.0|Jayson Greene

He's made gorgeously constructed techno under this name for over a decade, ultimately gaining traction with the sunny <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16071-dive/""><i>Dive</i></a> in 2011. In the context of <i>Awake</i>—the first Tycho record recorded as a three-piece band—his previous albums now sound like mere dreams of the luminous world he was trying so hard to connect to. Here, Hansen gains a skip in his step and strides right into that place, largely due to a shedding of the muddied beats and wistful synth tones that positioned him a little too close to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>'s retro-futuristic notions. There's more air here, lending a greater expanse of room to move around in than before, like travelling from a rundown seaside resort to vast scoops of desert plane. It's still recognizable as a Tycho recording, with a familiar sense of melancholy and the embers of sundown burning through it, but with the ambition clearly heightened right from the first few notes.</p>
<p>Not for nothing does the echoey guitar clang that opens a couple of these tracks (notably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16188-tycho-awake/"">""Awake""</a> and ""See"") sound like the Edge's long-familiar tones in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"">U2</a>. It's not exactly stadium-leaning, but if what came before felt more like bedroom creations, then here the Tycho sound is taken into a different area entirely, where everything glistens so brightly it feels like the work of someone who thinks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>' career began and ended with the ultra clean lines of ""Here Comes the Sun"". Something it shares with <i>Dive</i> is the feeling of journey, where tracks heard in isolation won’t make as much sense as picking up the long thread from beginning to end. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16540-montana/"">""Montana""</a> may reach a greater point of euphoria than the moodier ""Dye"", but watching how Hansen and his band arrive there is part of the thrill, with disparate moods slowly slotting into one another in a perfectly natural flow.</p>
<p>The sense of build Hansen possesses—knowing when to add and subtract, when to fade and zoom right back into focus—was a central tenet of the <i>Dive</i> sound, and it's a sensibility he retains here, although it doesn't always stop his work from circling perilously close to redundancy. ""Apogee"" is clearly supposed to be born from a moment of discordance, but it's an all-too brief divergence that makes it feel like the ideas are running dry when he returns to his tastefully constructed loops for the bulk of the track. Fortunately, Hansen keeps things brief, cutting <i>Awake</i> dead around the 35-minute mark after eight tracks. A common problem with bringing live instrumentation into techno is the heavy handedness that can set in—a dilemma <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">the Field</a>'s live-band incarnation often grapples with—although that's rarely an issue here. Only on ""Spectre"" does the subtlety loosen, but even there it offers release from the strong sense of control that can feel suffocating when the Tycho sound is so thoroughly pinned down.</p>
<p>Where all this leads Hansen and his creation is into a great pool of reflective thought, typified by the introspective guitar strum of ""Plains"". It feels like this is Tycho mining an older strain of music than the more contemporary references of <i>Dive</i>. There are nods to post-rock, but this feels like it's reaching further toward the sources of that genre than the acts themselves, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>'s aping of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25015-mike-oldfield/"">Mike Oldfield</a>'s <i>Tubular Bells</i> on <i>TNT</i> emerging as a strong reference point. Lessons have been learned from <i>Dive</i> here—this is a much leaner record that feels skillfully edited, with less use for indulgence and circular routes that don't lead anywhere. It could use a break from the pensive train of thought at times, and the tentative branches away from that mode suggest it's under consideration, if still not quite there yet. But the strong feeling of movement Hansen creates, as he quietly creeps through shades of orangey color, comes packed with dualling strains of sorrow and empathy.</p></div>"|19110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19110-tycho-awake/|7.0|Nick Neyland

The line, and all of the track's spoken word vocals, are delivered in a deadpan over sedate, washy, prolonged guitar chords. Soon, the monologue becomes deranged in its chilliness. ""And then I take my pet, and I go AHHHHHH."" At the moment of the scream, the vocals are distorted. The result: ""I killed it!"" The song is called ""Tommy Boy"", and all of its lyrics can be found on the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114694/quotes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IMDB ""quotes"" page</a> for the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114694/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1995 film</a> of the same name. The lines are given a deep-voiced and straight-faced reading, sort of like the Velvet Underground's ""The Gift"". Removed from the context of Chris Farley, the words are still funny, but in a dry, dark way that flirts with unsettling.</p>
<p>Offering context doesn't appear to be a priority for Beth Israel. Here's the readily available information on this band: There are two of them, Zack Claxon and Ramsey Eddins, and they're from Austin. There used to be a third member named Abler T. Heis. Both <i>Dental Denial</i> and their previous cassette were released via <a href=""http://dulltools.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dull Tools</a>—the label headed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a>' Andrew Savage. That's pretty much it; aside from sharing their music, they've kept a notably low profile on the internet.</p>
<p>Their album is similarly hard to pin down. They sing about destruction over a pulsating drone and hushed, beatific synths. Then, a prolonged, serious voice sings the words ""Maya Angelou"", the song's overall mood making her name sound like some forgotten mythical secret. On ""Living End"", they're absolutely shredding underneath muddy fidelity. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29258-purling-hiss/"">Purling Hiss</a> seem like an appropriate analogue, though their guitar sound could also feasibly befit a 16-bit video game. Throughout, they implement a variety of field recordings. Water flows through a stream for the introduction of ""Heat 2"". Birds chirp with a persistent, digitized echo that makes them sound like UFOs. Their percussion can be digital and tinny, but they compensate with a dense guitar sound. They manage to traverse this array of material with effective sequencing.</p>
<p>Their lyrics, as the source material behind ""Tommy Boy"" implies, are likely the most divisive element of <i>Dental Denial</i>. Again, there's no context, but they manage to jump from phrases that are absurd and silly to stuff that's more abstract yet weighty. ""Jamba Juice, Baja Fresh,"" they say at the outset of ""Family"". During the verse, the vocals are dour: ""I don't need medicine, it won't make up the rent."" In a song where they quickly namedrop chain restaurants and say ""I don't need shit,"" there's a line about health care. And sure, the tinny digital percussion can be an obstacle sometimes, but their hook writing is stellar. The melody on ""Dead Bodies""—led by chugging guitars, a synthesizer, and some perfectly executed vocal harmonies—is an undeniable highlight. Then there's the persistent bass line, erratic snare bursts, and sunny post-punk melody of ""Statue in the Car"". Though so much of the album is muffled, everything here is, quietly, very strong.</p>
<p>What's at once frustrating and captivating about <i>Dental Denial</i> is how it undersells so many of its best moments. They'll write a phrase that's fascinating or funny only to have it buried in the mix beneath other instruments. They'll establish an undeniable earworm, but they don't seem to linger for too long. That's what makes <i>Dental Denial</i> an album that demands multiple readings and further probing. It's like a good poetry book or soup recipe. You'll enjoy it initially, remember it fondly, have a difficult time nailing down favorite elements, and then return multiple times in order to truly <i>understand</i> it. Though trying to ""understand"" <i>Dental Denial </i>may be a fool's errand, it certainly rewards repeat visits. Like <i>Tommy Boy</i>.</p></div>"|19117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19117-beth-israel-dental-denial/|7.1|Evan Minsker

The member with the mid-range monotone, though, is Charlie Looker. He played guitar on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10577-rise-above/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rise Above</i></a>, worked as an early member of exploratory compositional collective Zs, and seemingly explored the borders of classical music, math-rock, and pop in the intriguing but woefully short-lived Extra Life. If you’re browsing an indie rock or experimental emporium, then, Looker’s past will likely arrive early and in parentheses.  </p>
<p>But <i>The Drain</i> pays less attention to the divide between Hock and Looker’s pasts and instead thrives on the tension between the union of their résumés. This is a gyre of metal aggression and industrial wallop, synthpop filigree and rock hooks, supported in places by Hock’s academic past in<a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/heavy-metal-be-bop-the-jazzmetal-odyssey-of-psalm-zeros-andrew-hock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> free jazz</a> and Looker’s exploration of <a href=""http://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=56527"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">classical forms such as madrigals</a>. “I’ve never written any music that was driven by, ‘Oh, it’s like this band, and I’m gonna make it,’” <a href=""http://www.hammersmashedsound.com/2014/03/interview-andrew-hock-of-psalm-zero.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hock told Andy O’Connor in an interview earlier this year.</a> “It feels totally honest and an actual synergy of all my influences, which are really broad.” Indeed, <i>The Drain </i>works as well as it does because it acknowledges the extremes of the sources that shaped it—the lift of the guitars of mid-period Katatonia, the gloom of Christian Death, the same twisted post-punk structures Hock works in Castavet—without overemphasizing such disparities. At their best, these songs are powered by the strain of those separate elements, not controlled by them.   </p>
<p>Psalm Zero link those interests immediately and obviously. In fact, the opener is also the title cut, an appropriate gambit given how much its music feels like the album’s thesis. It begins with a looming, Godflesh-like guitar theme, chased by dead-eyed bass and a plodding, heavy drum machine. But Looker’s voice is famously staid, delivering the first verse with a droll tone that springs melodies from the slightest rises and dives. When he’s done, the rhythm and riff suddenly shift, with the beat doubling over itself and the guitar twisting into knots. Hock enters, his voice a vitriolic rasp delivering bad news: “No words/ Don’t touch me/ Mouth shut/ Dumb fuck.” But the arrival of a wobbling, sliding synthesizer line becomes the velvet glove that doesn’t let the moment glower with purely metal aggression. “Force My Hand”,<a href=""http://lastthingsrecords.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> revisited here after it served as the A-side to the pair’s debut single</a>, turns similar tricks, blurring the dividing lines of a back-and-forth volley between Looker and Hock. It’s as if the music was written to dovetail to their voices—the heavier bits for Hock, the more rock-oriented moments for Looker—and then transposed by half. At one point, Looker sings above spiraling, steely guitar lines; at another, Hock shouts above tones so bright they sparkle. </p>
<p>The funneled inspirations aren’t always so clear, especially after the first two tracks bridge the divide with such obvious intent: Looker delivers “Chaos Body” with some help from Hock. Looker drops his monotone to yell a Prurient-like tirade about unease and torment over arrows of feedback and stuttering drums. Between those moments, though, the music is surging and vaguely triumphant, as the guitars shoot like pinballs between the flippers of the rhythm section. That’s especially true toward the end, when his harangue about what hell is and will forever be becomes backlit by music so tumescent and bright it could pass for a symphony’s grand reveal, albeit backed by flailing industrial rock. Hock doesn’t sing at all during “In the Dead”. Despite the especially macabre mood, Looker’s hook is alluring enough that it could belong to Depeche Mode’s <i>Violator</i>. But the drum machine pushes the turnarounds between the verses and chorus toward blast beats, and the instrumental interlude that bisects the tracks builds with an unease that suggests the song will split wide open into a death metal bruiser. It doesn’t, but even the threat is a thrill.</p>
<p>These ideas collide one final, perfect time during “Meanwhile”, a menacing industrial lurch that starts somewhere near Nine Inch Nails and ends north of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a>. Looker sings by himself over tight-wire guitar until the very end. He and Hock then trade lines, tempering the caustic with the consonant, and vice versa. It’s an anthem so unabashed it ends with horns. Profound Lore, the same label that released the incredible <i>Obsian</i> by Hock’s Castevet, issued <i>The Drain</i>, too. As metal imprints go, Profound Lore has been a clearinghouse of excellence in recent years, with a roster that reads like its own best-of list. But these seven songs—successful composites of unlikely origin—could fit with artists and interests as diverse as those of Mute or Thrill Jockey. Hopefully, the insignia on the back of the box or the name listed first in the credits doesn’t prevent non-metal listeners from finding <i>The Drain</i>. Its influences and ambitions are much wider than that cloister, and its songs are capable of both hitting hard and sticking around. </p></div>"|19070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19070-psalm-zero-the-drain/|7.7|Grayson Haver Currin

Following a searing, four-song demo tape released last year, their proper full-length debut <i>Say Yes to Love</i> is an unrelentingly intense experience—23 minutes of five people pushing themselves to their absolute limit. Frontwoman Meredith Graves has called the band's songs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9244-perfect-pussy/"">""happy revelations about incendiary events,""</a> and this remains the most fitting description of their music. It doesn’t feel corny or hyperbolic to call this record life-affirming, so perfectly does it capture the flashes of gratitude, self-knowledge, and inexplicable joy that often follow an experience of great pain.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A Perfect Pussy song comes together in layers, and the group’s writing process is a kind of sonic avalanche. Graves <a href=""http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/perfect-pussys-meredith-graves-qa-other-bands-complacency-is-the-reason-im-never-ever-ever-going-to"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a> that her bandmates Ray McAndrew (guitar), Garrett Koloski (drums), and Greg Ambler (bass) usually record a totally clean track first, and then she and keyboardist Shaun Sutkus come in and ""make noise on purpose."" That approach gives these songs an energy that is both chaotic and collaborative—the instruments sound like they're wrestling each other for space instead of working in harmony. And the textures of the eight songs on <i>Say Yes to Love</i> are damaged but also luminous; even at its most assaultive moments, like the gale-force ripper ""Advance Upon the Real"", jangly chords and a bright melody shine defiantly somewhere below the surface.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Say Yes to Love</i> is so relentlessly pummeling that it's almost meditative, and its songs are caked in so much sludge it's often hard to make out what Graves is saying. Until, very suddenly, it's not. You know the feeling when you're in a place that's so loud and crowded that you have to scream into the ear of the person next to you, and then suddenly the room goes quiet and now everyone can hear you? And how this always seems to happen when you're saying the most private and potentially embarrassing thing? In a Perfect Pussy song, this happens to Graves constantly—""AND I WANT TO FUCK MYSELF/ AND I WANT TO EAT MYSELF,"" she is caught saying in one of these moments of jolting clarity. But a great power emerges as she delivers even her most vulnerable lines without a twinge of shame. She sounds emboldened by silence, her presence growing to fill it, like a person whose voice has been stifled and is now overjoyed by the chance to be heard.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's easy to be overtaken by the primal force of this music but there's also an incentive to dig deeper. <i>Say Yes to Love </i>is a convincing argument for reviving that practice of reading along with the lyrics while listening. Graves' lines are full of vivid, visceral, and often unsettling images (""You can read the story of my last six weeks/ In little black bruises and marks from boys' teeth"") and the sort of bold confessions plenty of people wouldn't tell their best friends. And her delivery is at once shit-kickingly tough and childlike, sometimes reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5402-life-without-buildings/"">Life Without Buildings</a> vocalist Sue Tompkins' wide-eyed swagger.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Perfect Pussy have been criticized for the buried vocals and often unintelligible lyrics, but the approach serves a purpose. There's tension in this music between vulnerability and defenses, between the things we tell each other and the things we feel the need to keep hidden. The lyrics to songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16714-perfect-pussy-interference-fits/"" target=""_blank"">""Interference Fits""</a> and ""Dig"" (which meditates on sex and violence) are so intense that hearing every word could almost be a distraction—it'd be hard to pay attention to anything else. So you're given a choice of how to experience these songs: You can lose yourself in the rush, or you can follow along and think more closely about what they're trying to say.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There are a few moments in ""Big Stars"" when the feedback squall sounds like it's bleeping out something Graves is saying. If it's intentional, it's a pretty good joke about arbitrary censorship—a topic Perfect Pussy know well as they've quickly gone from being evangelized in limited-run underground zines to being covered in publications too refined to print their name. But an irony that we're just starting to understand as a culture is that, for women in particular, the first word in Perfect Pussy's name is much more obscene than the second. If you're female, it's far more socially acceptable to express self-deprecation than self-love, and it's more acceptable for anybody to express numbly detached nihilism than Perfect Pussy's particular brand of hard-won, audaciously blazing joy. Something about <i>Say Yes to Love</i>—the way Graves' bright, confidently optimistic vocals are threatened to be drowned out at every turn—speaks to the forces that make women in our society feel like they must exist in a constant state of perceived inadequacy. And fuck all that, says Graves at the end of the careening ""Dig"": ""If I'm anything less than perfection/ Well shit, nobody told me!"" <i>Say Yes to Love</i> is one of the hardest and most jarring records I've heard in a long time, not because it's trying to shock you with darkness, but because it's unafraid to stare directly into the light.</p></div>"|19086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19086-perfect-pussy-say-yes-to-love/|8.6|Lindsay Zoladz

In an alternate universe, it'd be the first transmission from some plucky pop artist being groomed for stardom. Instead, the short EP is both an announcement and a confident distillation, the essence of what makes Diouf so captivating, packaged up into something mass consumable and effortlessly fun.</span><br/> <br/> <span>""I’m pretty much always leaning toward futuristic, progressive beats, so if something sounds even a couple months dated to me then I’m already over it,"" Diouf <a href=""http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/le1f-gets-record-deal-talks-macklemore-and-letterman/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently told <i>Vogue </i></a>in an interview surrounding his signing to Terrible/XL. For this one he's still aligned with his longtime collaborators—underground producers like Matrixxman, Boody and Dubbel Dutch—but the beats are pared down and utilitarian, skeletal backdrops that contrast his wordplay rather than wrap around it. Compare that to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17682-fly-zone/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fly Zone </i></a>or last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18506-le1f-tree-house/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tree House</i></a>, brilliant mixtapes where Le1f took on weirder and more ambient beats as an implicit challenge to write odd flows that dove and soared across the wide contours. ""Hey"", on the other hand, is a mere whistle and some horns, which makes the music feel timeless instead of trendy. More importantly, it gives Le1f's venomous slither center stage. </span><br/> <br/> <span>And he's more ornery than ever; or maybe determined is a better word. <i>Hey </i>is aimed pointedly at its prospective audience: latecomers, hangers-on and fawning journalists alike. Diouf sounds both hungry and content, like he's trying to persuade you of his skills but confident enough to know that he <i>will</i> succeed. <i>Hey </i>is all about identity—about reclaiming, defining and reinforcing it—and he snarls like the leader of a pack. ""Sup"" is the the kind of autotuned bragging-about-your-crew number that could centrepiece a drill tape out of Chicago, and on ""Boom"" he spits ""new world order/ LGBT cuties all over the world are diamonds and pearls"" like he's leading a march out into the open. He's still a fiercely sexual lyricist too, even directly referencing his own penchant for frank and decadent fantasies (""he wanna hanky panky but he can't handle how otherworldly I am""). </span><br/> <br/> <span>As slimmed-down as the beats might be, Diouf still finds ways to instil them with personality. On ""Buzz,"" he embellishes the chorus with buzzing bee vocalizations and layers his voice deliriously through the verses, creating a surrealist smear of vocal fry and processing artefacts that feels truly alien without being alienating. A string of Pokémon mentions on ""Hey"" and a pileup of Starbucks references on ""Sup"" are humorous and witty, the kind of densely packed writing we take for granted from Le1f that make him such a fascinating lyricist beneath all the surface dazzle.</span><br/> <br/> <span>There's a newly mastered version of 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13904-wut/"" target=""_blank"">""Wut""</a>, Le1f's biggest hit so far. It's an opportunist move that makes the EP feel more like a marketing tool than a statement, but <i>Hey</i> is most likely a stopgap on the way to something bigger. It's still impressive how Diouf takes to the song's knotty twists and turns with ease, motoring through its virtuosic second verse with pure finesse. Taking on a new resonance in light of Macklemore's moral hijacking of gay issues in rap and (alleged) direct hijacking of 5kinandbone5's original beat, ""Wut"" now sounds like a veteran doing his thing like a pro. So maybe <i>Hey</i> isn't the cry of a scrappy newcomer—rather, a reminder that he's an incredible rapper and wordsmith regardless of the bullshit. Ask him a gay question, and he'll give you a rap answer.</span></p></div>"|19111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19111-le1f-hey-ep/|7.6|Andrew Ryce

The pair met when Murphy was setting up a studio in a New York building where Lambkin had an office, and the latter has released music as Shit Robot sporadically in the years since. The title of his first full-length, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14679-from-the-cradle-to-the-rave/""><i>From the Cradle to the Rave</i></a>, hinted at his status as a lifer at this game, but few of his musical fascinations venture outside a small set of dance music influences. Lambkin's not necessarily interested in being current but he is interested in getting back to that moment of complete white-out on the dancefloor, where the future and past cease to matter and all that's left is to get lost in the present.</p>
<p><i>We Got a Love</i> reads like an exercise in DFA box-ticking on the surface, and digging deeper doesn't reveal much depth beyond that. Tropes from house, rave, and disco are all present, along with a familiar switch-up between wailing and monotone vocals from an array of guests. But depth is probably something Lambkin never intended to be there in the first place. As a club record to zone out to, this doesn't reach the euphoria of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a> at his best, or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2244-the-juan-maclean/"">the Juan MacLean</a>'s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16116-feel-like-movin/"">""Feel Like Movin'""</a>, which was released last year on the flipside of Shit Robot's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12719-reggie-watts/"">Reggie Watts</a>-featuring single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52249-video-shit-robot-and-reggie-watts-we-got-a-love/"">""We Got a Love""</a>. But it works for what it is—a solid set of impeccably produced club jams, all rinsed through an atmosphere that's never less than jubilant.</p>
<p>Watts has a couple of features here, bookending an album that includes appearances from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29318-nancy-whang-of-lcd-soundsystem/"">Nancy Whang</a> and Luke Jenner from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"">the Rapture</a>. Despite the array of approaches—Watts can go deadpan or diva, Whang is ultra flat, Jenner goes the full <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27403-bee-gees/"">Barry Gibb</a>—there's a firm hand guiding it all, bringing in piano stabs at just the right moment along with carefully programmed mechanical loops and clattering percussion and handclaps. The vintage house feel and ""jack your body"" refrain of ""Do It (Right)"" is as nostalgic and backward-looking as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2353-kings-of-leon/"">Kings of Leon</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford &amp; Sons</a>, but it's filtered through a set of influences that will remain forever impeccable. This is a world where <a href=""http://youtu.be/Lr-OgG1A74c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Darryl Pandy</a> and <a href=""http://youtu.be/kPYese-Hl8M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anita Ward</a> simply never grow old, remaining forever locked down in their finest moments.</p>
<p>Music that borrows heavily from dance music's past and post-punk is common, but Shit Robot sees little worth plundering beyond 1991 or 1992. The cut-off point here, and arguably across the DFA spectrum, appears to be the introduction of jungle and drum'n'bass, at which point a stern barrier to entry comes clattering down. An artist needn't enter that space, of course, but <i>We Got a Love</i> feels like a place we've visited countless times before, which raises questions about going back yet again. Even though the record is irresistible at times, it's also a feedback loop of nostalgia that's creaking as it turns.</p></div>"|19112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19112-shit-robot-we-got-a-love/|6.4|Nick Neyland

He's a Scribble Jam champ and Project Blowed vet, so he's versed in battle rap and its tendency to thrive on a heady blend of lyrical intricacy and haymaker punchlines. And if that's not enough, his presence as co-host of the hip-hop podcast <a href=""http://shotsfiredpodcast.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Shots Fired</span></a> (which, for the sake of full disclosure, is a joint production with Pitchfork contributor Jeff Weiss) reveals him as a relentless smartass whose depth of knowledge and easy rapport are only matched by his ability to tell a hilarious anecdote or six. Tie that into the precedence of his more recent albums—2010's <i>Jimmy the Lock </i>(where every other line was a clever piece of a swagnostic manifesto) and last year's mixtape<i> Tits 'n Explosions</i> (which is, well, called Tits 'n Explosions)—and it's hard not to go into one of his tracks without expecting at least some kind of slick joke to turn up.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Jimmy the Burnout </i><span>isn't all that different in that respect. Nocando's casually perceptive voice drops cliche-inverting quips and irreverent punchlines on the regular (from ""Little Green Monsters"": ""I'm just another dick and this rap game is a glory hole""). And he sneaks in a pair of skits featuring comedians Jermaine Fowler (a meta-skit where he tries to pitch a skit idea) and Eric Andre</span><span>. But throughout </span><span><i>Jimmy the Burnou</i>t, </span><span>weaved in through the punchlines and the witty turns of phrase, are deeper things. Nocando is a grown-ass man with a family, fresh into his thirties with plenty to look back on, and it's clear that through maturation and experience his sense of humor can trend towards the dark—not always edgy, but often on edge.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Intricate metaphors and shit-talk alone don't put you in a class with Aceyalone and Murs, so it's fortunate that Nocando rarely if ever just focuses on spitting for its own sake here. Once you get past the diabolical vibe and halfway-horrorcore minor-key g-funk skulk of ""Little Green Monsters"", you can catch a rapper whose confidence and ambivalence are regularly at odds (""It's funny how stupid we feel the more we know/ Baby we ate off the same plate, how come all the porcelain broke""), even if he finds a way to make it sound like confidence is just one unguarded shot away from rallying towards a blowout. He raps about relationships in a way that sidesteps the potential corniness in being vulnerable, like when he sees an old flame and realizes ""you never looked better/ until the day I saw you hanging off another nigga's arm"" (""Never Looked Better"") or tries to reconcile a tense, guarded moment between himself and his partner (""Too Much to Ask""). And whether he's pulling double-overtime in the shadow of his cousin locked in Chino (""3rd World Hustle"") or standing up for people who're treated like they'll never amount to anything (the Mono/Poly remix of ""Zero Hour""), he makes his stories of day-to-day struggles and striving to overcome bullshit ring as true as the best conscious-rap message tracks without a bitter aftertaste. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The fluidity of Nocando's voice deserves crediting for that. The way he works with the beats on </span><i>Jimmy the Burnout </i><span>is borderline chameleonic, able to snap tight to the mood of the track and jump right in with a crucial hook. That stands out clearly early on after a three-track run—the piano-and-horns throwback pop-soul of ""Break Even"", the cloudy chopped-vox-and-snare rumblings on ""Did You Know That???"", and the buttery slow-jam homage ""Too Much to Ask"" (all produced by Caleb Stone)—where he flips from knotty, assonant internal rhymes to straight-ahead choruses like the seasoned pro he is. Sometimes, production-by-committee results in a scattershot album where the identity and the vibe never really cohere. But here, it's just a good excuse for him to stretch out and put all his facets out there, whether he's amped up on Djemba Djemba's gospel-gothic boom-bap (""Hellfyre Club Anthem"") or floating through some of Dâm-Funk's emotionally (and bodily) moving ""smile with a tear"" space-boogie (""Lucid Dream""). That he's showing this kind of range might be Nocando's slickest joke of all: his name just keeps getting more ironic with each record.</span></p></div>"|19113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19113-nocando-jimmy-the-burnout/|7.7|Nate Patrin

While his Swedish groups <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3259-parson-sound/"">Pärson Sound</a>, <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/international-harvester-mn0000910177/biography"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Harvester</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A4d,_Gr%C3%A4s_%26_Stenar"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Träd, Gräs Och Stenar</a> didn’t sell tons of records, for a certain cross-section of the underground, their sprawling swirl of psych, folk, noise, and abstraction was a sound ripe for worship. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/293-bardo-pond/"">Bardo Pond</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12-acid-mothers-temple/"">Acid Mothers Temple</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3980-sunburned-hand-of-the-man/"">Sunburned Hand of the Man</a> all owe their smoky trails in part to the paths that Persson’s bands blazed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Persson’s solo music might have made as much impact over the past five decades, if anyone had actually heard it. One piece did make a small dent: the 1967 tape-loop protest “Proteinimperialism,” released in 1970 on a<a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Folke-Rabe-Bo-Anders-Persson-Was-Proteinimperialism/release/219801"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> split LP</a> with fellow countryman <a href=""http://www.folkerabe.se/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Folke Rabe</a>. But it turns out Persson had a lot more going on before he formed his avant-rock groups with fellow students at Stockholm’s Royal College of Music. Inspired to “play music the way I myself imagined that it should sound,” he crafted tape-based experiments and ensemble compositions that rival his pioneering later work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As heard on the archival compilation <i>Love Is Here to Stay</i>, these early Persson pieces reflect their times and predict later advances, yet ultimately stand as the unique work of a singular vision. Granted, Persson was influenced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>, whom he met when his mentor, the composer <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/546086-Jan-Bark"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jan Bark</a>, brought him to Sweden to lead a version of <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_C"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In C</a></i> in which Persson played electric organ. You can hear Riley’s musical voice echoing through Persson’s tape experiments, which build and expand the way Riley’s did. But there’s a simplicity to Persson’s approach that makes his work more primal, and more personal. Most of his pieces use just a few sonic elements, and are clear about where they are and what they’re doing. Their power comes not from overwhelming your ears but focusing them, directing concentration to detail rather than density.</p>
<p>They also make a fascinating study in combining tapes with other instruments, in ways that end up like collaborative duets. On “Invention” parts I and II, Persson intersects his recorders with the flute of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rn_J:son_Lindh"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Björn J:son Lindh</a>, creating what at times sound like embryonic versions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3038-phill-niblock/"">Phill Niblock</a>’s rock-solid drones. Even more intriguing is Persson’s use of Maylen Bergström’s singing. On “Piece I”, her free-form vocalizing evokes <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Waters"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patty Waters</a>’ height-scaling and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"">Yoko Ono</a>’s quiver. Persson grounds those flights with loops both rhythmic and responsive, supporting Bergström without blocking her. Later, on “Piece II”, tape repetitions move forward, soaking the vocals until they become pure waves.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Persson’s ensemble compositions also feature interlocked partnership. “Små toner mer eller mindre,” from a 1967 Swedish radio broadcast, uses five players, yet it’s still thoroughly, calmly minimalist. No individual element dominates; at times it seems as if everyone is playing one instrument together, lending intimacy to something that could have sounded crowded. “Love Is Here to Stay”, by contrast, has moments of clutter, and is the clearest foreshadow of Persson’s group work, as his conga rhythms turn it into a kind of rock meditation. But even this piece feels personal, more the echoes of a mind than the rumblings of a collective.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Love Is Here To Stay </i>ends with its only previously-released track, the aforementioned “Proteinimperialism”. Its overt political slant, based on a repeated phrase signifying the environmental dominance of the Western World, is also unique among these pieces. In fact, were you to listen to the rest ofthe album without further context, you might think Persson’s solo work was significant primarily for its formal experimentation, at a time when minimalism was just starting to gel and infect genres outside of academic composition.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That wouldn’t be wrong, but there’s more going on here than aesthetic progress. Persson was particularly concerned about the environment—he took up music after abandoning engineering because of machines’ impact on nature—and a love of surroundings, an appreciation of the organic, is evident throughout the album. (Not coincidentally, Persson now devotes most of his waking hours to farming his own food). The music develops with little restriction and, even at its most tape-manipulative, doesn't sound artificial. Perhaps the loudest message of <i>Love Is Here to Stay</i> is that complex ideas are sometimes best expressed in the most uncomplicated ways.</p></div>"|19116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19116-bo-anders-persson-love-is-here-to-stay/|7.6|Marc Masters

Postepski and Alfons shared both songwriting and vocal duties on <i>TRST</i>, making her exit not just sudden, but potentially drastic. Yet there's something strangely fitting about Alfons carrying on as a solo project: Trust, after all, are precisely the kind of band that seems to thrive on alienation and solitude. Even the clubbier tracks on <i>TRST</i> had a a dark, dissociative, alone-in-a-crowd feel, better suited for a 4 AM freakout in a windowless room than any kind of communal catharsis. <i>Joyland</i>, the Alfons-only Trust's second effort, is a couple notches sleeker than its predecessor, but that lurching, sweating-off-the-pancake-makeup smear of <i>TRST</i> continues unabated on the scowling, subterranean release. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Alfons makes a pretty good loner.<br/><br/>Opener ""Slightly Floating"" eases you into <i>Joyland</i> slowly, its twinkling keyboards and choral swirl getting you good and acclimated to the darkness ahead. By the time ""Geryon"" rolls around, you're in deep: the bass throbs, synths sputter and shriek, while Alfons' sleep-deprived, sin-soaked baritone implores you to do something you'll spend the next three days trying to forget. Foreboding four-on-the-floor bangers like ""Geryon"" are <i>Joyland</i>'s stock-and-trade; it's a dance record for the club underneath the club, where the velvet rope's blood-spattered and the VIP section's a bathroom stall. Even when the tempos unclench, this queasy, addled vibe persists. Taken alone, the starry-eyed, breath-catching chorus of ""Are We Arc?"" would be plainly gorgeous. To get there, though, you'll have to wade through a good minute of Alfons' perilous mumble. <i>Joyland</i> never flinches; you can almost picture Alfons sizing you up with a glazed stare, making sure you're ready to see some things you can't easily unsee.<br/><br/>Whether left unadorned or taffy-pulled into the upper registers, Alfons' stern, self-serious vocal tone is given even more room to slither throughout <i>Joyland</i>. In his review of <i>TRST</i>, Larry Fitzmaurice compared Alfons to a ""goth Eeyore""; point being, the guy's not exactly the type to light up a room. With Postepski gone, Alfons is responsible for every voice on <i>Joyland</i>, from the pip squeaking chorus of ""Lost Souls/Eelings"" to his gravelly, graven turn on ""Icabod"". As before, Alfons slathers his voice with effects, bending, folding, and reshaping syllables into not-always-comprehensible shapes. As with <i>TRST</i>, Alfons' pitch-shifted, disaffected voice—repulsive one minute, riveting the next—is certainly Trust's most distinguishing characteristic. But, on a 50 minute album like <i>Joyland</i>, these oft-garbled exhortations—coupled with <i>Joyland</i>'s icy synths and weaponized rhythms—have a distancing effect. <br/><br/>Throughout <i>Joyland</i>, the dingy hues introduced on <i>TRST</i> have deepened; Alfons has somehow managed to open up more space in his sound without sacrificing that twitchy, walls-closing-in vibe. Songwise, though, <i>Joyland</i>'s just not quite at the same level. The emotional range throughout <i>Joyland</i> is fairly narrow—you've got your dark greys, and your pitch blacks—and memorable hooks often seem to take a backseat to tone and texture. Verses often seem rushed, with Alfons barreling through in that stern monotone, only to come alive around the choruses. <i>Joyland</i>'s surface pleasures—fizzling synths, dry-heave rhythms—often seem to take precedence over its songcraft: the moaning, rave-ready ""Icabod"" is a true monster, up there with anything on <i>TRST</i>, but the pulsing tempos of all but a couple of these songs often seem to blot out everything else around them, and the more patient numbers often feel a bit shapeless, little more than excuses to test out another new effect on Alfons' malleable voice. The oily, immersive <i>Joyland</i>'s very nearly the equal of its predecessor. But with so many similarities—and so little growth—between the two records, it's a little like spending another night at the same club: once you've gotten the lay of the land, the thrills are never quite so thrilling.</p></div>"|19103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19103-trust-joyland/|6.8|Paul Thompson

The rapper, born Shante Franklin, had once been a gangster rapper, one of the semi-anonymous weed carriers that populated Lil Wayne’s Young Money Entertainment imprint. Like so many of his fellows, Curren$y, who frequently refers to himself as Spitta, wasn’t promoted properly while on YME, but he also was an ill fit for the label’s gangster-lite subject matter at the time. </p>
<p class=""p1"">After leaving Young Money, he hit upon a formula that worked better: rapping about his smoked-out lifestyle, an aspirational, unpretentious, working man’s fantasy of fast cars, fast women and copious amounts of THC. Curren$y found his trademark style, discussing that subject matter with a flow which didn’t so much find a beats’ pockets as create creases of its own. Pairing those raps with the lush boom-bap of the producer Ski Beats on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14474-pilot-talk/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pilot Talk </i></a>records yielded two near-perfect albums of stoner fantasia.</p>
<p class=""p1"">He has not made a project with the same kind of impact since. That has a lot to with artistic inertia—like many prolific musicians, Curren$y can seem more interested in the present, cranking out song after song, than he does in making specific creative statements. The closest he gets is warmed-over concepts like the one that powers his new mixtape <i>The Drive In Theatre, </i>a tired tribute to the Godfather that’s ostensibly supposed to double as a paean to movies in general.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the <i>Pilot Talks</i> weren’t great because they provided an insider’s look into the aviating life—Curren$y’s concepts have traditionally been smoked-out deviations more than anything else.  Instead, they functioned as mood albums, the lush beats creating a perfect atmosphere for Spitta’s offbeat flow to come in and make itself at home.  And the new mixtape is the first since that 2010 duo to create a similar atmosphere, making it the rapper’s strongest project in nearly four years.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A lot of that has to do with the guiding hand of Thelonius Martin, who produced just under half the songs here and who keeps it orchestral, with brass-happy, atmospheric boom bap that provides the perfect backdrop to Curren$y’s diaristic scribbling.  “Vintage Vinyard” is a great example of the intimacy on display. It’s a jazzy, off-the-cuff tale of the successful man’s life, opulent, but also filled with paranoia, reflections on one’s place in the artistic hierarchy and quiet moments with the wife. “Hi-Top Whites” keys in on a single detail about a woman, but in the course of getting to the shoe-talk, gives an absorbing account of a day in the life. Curren$y is smoothest over beats like these, where his leaping from one topic to another feels less unfocused and more in sync with the improvisational jazz providing a foundation below him.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even when Martin is not in charge, the album’s producers do a good job at keeping the vibe consistent. The production team of Cardo and Young Exclusive contribute a blown out bass to “$ Sign Migraine” buts it’s the floating mid-tempo tones that help the song to vibe with the rest of the album. Cooking Soul, who fans will recall from their late-aughts remix albums, come through with the first truly absorbing beat on the project, the mellow backdrop of “Stove Top"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">If there is a uniting theme on <i>The Drive In Theatre, </i>it’s that<i> </i>Curren$y seems more reflective than usual, a rap veteran reconciling himself with his place in the music business. The posse cut “Grew Up In This” includes a hook that could be interpreted as an assertion of gangster authenticity (“I grew up in this shit”) but it seems to double as a contemplation of being a working man’s rapper, tirelessly grinding out songs and navigating a perilous industry with finesse. “Grew Up In This” also features excellent verses from both Young Roddy and Freddie Gibbs, the former a Curren$y protege who seems to finally have found his own voice, the latter a rapper with a career path similar to and a record of making great songs with Curren$y.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Curren$y has always had good taste in collaborators and the other features on the album are equally effective. Fiend and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31027-smoke-dza/"" target=""_blank"">Smoke DZA</a> both sound great over the handclaps and sax that power “The Usual Suspects.” And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a> saves what might otherwise be a weak opening track, “Godfather Four.” (The beat loops <i>The Godfather’s</i> theme music, which sounds great, but is awfully gimmicky<i>.)</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">That beat is just one of the many ways in which <i>The Drive In Theatre</i> is studded with the trappings of a much weaker concept album—there are also plenty of unnecessary snippets of dialogue from Coppola’s movies.<i> </i>But just as <i>Pilot Talk</i> became a euphemism for the kind of lifestyle rap that Curren$y excels at, the movie theater signifiers mostly evaporate to reveal a reflective rapper with a keen eye for detail and a true gift for beat selection: the atmosphere is cinematic, in scope if nothing else.<b> </b>Curren$y puts out a lot of music, and fans could be forgiven for missing a mixtape here and there. But <i>The Drive In Theatre, </i>premiered on Datpiff with next-to-no promotion, proves once again, that Curren$y is one of a certain group of artists that it pays to keep your eye on.</p></div>"|19131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19131-curreny-the-drive-in-theatre/|7.6|Jonah Bromwich

The German producer's spent the last 20 years and change pushing at the edges of ambient techno as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22045-move-d/"" target=""_blank"">Move D</a>, slipping snatches of jazz and Tropicália into the genre's squishy confines. His many collaborative efforts have resulted in a deep and varied catalog reflecting a wide emotive range not always easy to pull off in the squishy sub-genre of dance music he works in, embodying <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR3WtdLXP8E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">darkness</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN3PRP3XEvw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">light</a> in equal measure.</p>
<p>His reputation for versatility is impressive; in the last five years, he scored a direct hit with his jittery 2008 LP with Hamburg auteur Benjamin Brunn, <i>Songs From the Beehive</i>, while toiling away on his own with releases for reputed labels such as Workshop and Modern Love. At the end of last year, he dropped his latest solo LP, <i>The Silent Orbiter</i>, a largely beatless, elegiac excursion that mourned the death of frequent collaborator Pete Namlook.</p>
<p>A seasoned veteran whose versatility is as much owed to his natural talent as it is to the general adventurousness possessed by his peers who similarly came up in the 90s, Moufang has proved impressively hard to pin down on record—not so when it comes to his reputation as a DJ, though. Despite his restless penchant for experimentation, he understands well that when it comes to the dancefloor, you simply can't fuck around with the audience's idea of a good time. He frequently delivers compelling sets of warm, lush house and techno that is far removed from the electronic abstractions he's known for, and the 74th entry in London superclub Fabric's long-running mix series is an excellent direct reflection of Moufang's explicitly crowd-pleasing side.</p>
<p>Judging alone by the mere proliferation of the artform, it would appear that the latest iteration of the digital age has brought with it a golden age of the mix; in truth, the sheer ease that new technology provides (not to mention the hands it often lands in) has made for a glut of mixes from both professionals and amateurs that eschew such important building blocks as patience and build in favor of simply filling the air with sound. <i>Fabric 74</i>, then, is the type of professional, elegant effort that only pops up a few times a year; instead of offering an intentional survey of a scene or a reflection of an artist's vision, though, it's clear that Moufang is intent on bringing his own party-starting side to the home-listening audience. An hour-plus of lovely, classic-sounding house music partially comprised of tunes he's snuck into recent sets, it's taken the crown of being the most endlessly listenable mix released in this young year thus far.</p>
<p>Many mixes possess a general rising and falling action, with a few peaks dotted along the way; with <i>Fabric 74</i>, Moufang draws a straight line placed at a high altitude, maintaining an impossibly consistent level of energy that speaks to the subtlety demanded in crafting ambient techno as peerless as the type that makes up the Move D catalog. His selections are impressive and as much ripped from house's past as they are from its present: there's Chicago vet Roy Davis Jr.'s radiant ""Under Tha Sun"", the winding garage-infused sounds of Dom 877's 2013 roiler ""Do It Right"", and Chi house mainstay DJ Pierre's 1992 single as Darkman, the Grace Jones-sampling ""Annihilating Rhythm"". Moufang creates a uniform vibe that rejects sameness through subtle variation, as Amsterdam jazzy-techno auteurs and frequent collaborators Juju &amp; Jordash's rippling ""Loosey Goosey"", taken from their excellent 2012 LP <i>Techno Primitivism</i>, slips in to add different textures without disrupting the general flow.</p>
<p>For a genre that possesses such potential for emotional transcendence, dance fans are a notoriously cranky bunch—but the one complaint I've seen mentioned regarding <i>Fabric 74</i> has some merit: Willow's ""Feel Me"", a deconstructed web of filtered vocals and distant, bleeping tones, inarguably kills the mood with its needless abstractions. The tune sounds like it'd do better on one of Moufang's many creative endeavors, but placed near the end of <i>Fabric 74</i>, the tune serves as a minor buzzkill supported by an impressively consistent, peerlessly mixed series of tunes. House music's gotten a lot of burn in the last 18 months, breaking into international pop charts and triggering a wave of new-jacks and also-rans that have likely spent more time focusing on the form's general structure than the many subtleties buried deep within its past. <i>Fabric 74</i>, then, is a blast of a history lesson from a certifiable old soul, a reverent document that never loses sight of the fact that, as dance fans, we're all here to have a good time in the end.</p></div>"|19102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19102-move-d-fabric-74/|8.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Each of those outfits, in its own way, made a name for itself by pulverizing the syntax of rock—Neubauten using brain and sinew, the Lizard using gonad and intestine—and constructing something singularly unsettling in its place. But <i>The Unsemble</i>, the eponymous debut album by a trio comprising Alexander Hacke of Einstürzende Neubauten and Duane Denison of the Jesus Lizard (along with past <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"" target=""_blank"">Silver Jews</a> drummer Brian Kotzur), is not the logical output of such an equation. Neither industrial nor pigfuck, it’s a refined, even contemplative assemblage of instrumental art-rock with a marked lack of shit getting bashed.</p>
<p>Not that <i>The Unsemble</i> is strictly background music—or rather, it <i>is</i> background music, even though it wallpapers a speculative tableau in which nebulous perception and queasy surreality are the norm. In spite of Hacke and Denison being the big names here, the album feels more like a collaboration between Hacke and Kotzur, seeing as how they’ve each done film work before (Hacke as a soundtrack composer for Uli M Schueppel and Kotzur as an actor in Harmony Korine’s <i>Trash Humpers</i>). That cinematic envisioning of the Unsemble’s essential mission—which otherwise appears to be little more than an ad hoc, let’s-book-two-weeks-in-the-studio-and-see-what-happens arrangement—is most vivid on the track “Act 3"". Hacke’s boiled-in-oil bass line actually sounds more like the Jesus Lizard’s low-end from the axe of David Wm. Sims, all grease and grunts and grated knuckles—but in Hacke’s hands the twang is rolled off the top, leaving just the raspy, prog-punk chug. Kotzur subdivides the syncopation, leaving Denison to bob above that tight helix of rhythm, towing a wispy chemtrail of guitar.</p>
<p>As imagistic as much of <i>The Unsemble</i> is, it’s short on emotion—which in this case is preferable, seeing as how the album’s mix of composition and improvisation gives these visceral players a welcome cerebral pretext. The drawback being, it’s also short on <i>mood</i>. A vague aura of detachment is about the only atmosphere it can muster, and even that, maybe aptly, never fully coheres. These guys are listening to each other, but they’re not exactly vibing. “Chaingang”—another score in search of a scene—shoots for menace but ends up almost comical, as its literal chain-rattling not only makes a self-parody of the title, but a self-parody of Hacke’s found-object legacy with Neubauten. In one sense it’s a welcome nod to an approach that Hacke, of all people, can lay almost full claim to; on the other, it partly defeats the purpose of seeing what new directions this convocation can yank itself in. And the five improvised tracks—“Improv 1”, “Improv 2”, etc.—don’t congeal until “4”, where a tentative, chamber-jazz crawl turns simultaneously skeletal and sinuous, leaving an afterimage of weird worlds in the distance while tapping into an earthy, nearly shamanic pulse.</p>
<p>The most rewarding, yet most frustrating, experiments on <i>The Unsemble</i> are the songs that rock hardest. Along with “Act 3”, the tracks “Shadows” and “Circles Revisited” feature teeming, lurching bass-and-guitar paired with an intricate percussive thump. They move, but they also leave little to the imagination—which is where the strength of “Waves” and “Voices”, in all their empty, drifting prettiness, lies. “Neon”, however, is the album’s head-and-shoulders highlight—a Goblin-esque throb of spectral, synthetic delicacy laced with cascading arpeggios and a gentle gravitas—that once again accentuates the cinematic nature of the collaboration. But it’s telling that the Unsemble grip hardest when they’re hewing closely to their inspirations—as well as the bands from which they sprang.</p></div>"|19128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19128-the-unsemble-the-unsemble/|6.6|Jason Heller

When metalcore became the sound on the mid-00s thanks to </span><i>Uranium</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> and the rebirth of </span><i>Headbangers Ball</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, bands that didn't rip off At the Gates took a lot from Ringworm and their NYHC-meets-thrash sound. They've influenced so many bands on the Baltimore metal/hardcore label A389 that the label may as well be called The House Ringworm Built. While bands like D.R.I., Cryptic Slaughter, and S.O.D. served in breaking down the boundaries between punk and metal, Ringworm brought that dedication into the 90s onward. Given their legacy, they haven't been that prolific. Their second album, </span><i>Birth is Pain</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, came out in 2001, after the band had broken up for some time. </span><i>Hammer of the Witch</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, their sixth overall and first for Relapse, shows the quintet remaining as consistent as ever.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Most Ringworm songs are have the same ingredients: thrashy riffs, breakdowns, and a total absence of pretension. They're all to the point, much like the harshness of living in an Ohio town where the factory isn't ever coming back. Still, there's a certain precision that these songs have— no coincidence, since guitarists John Comprix and Matt Sorg have also played in Charred Walls of the Damned (who feature Richard Christy from <i>The Howard Stern Show</i> and formerly of Iced Earth and Death) and former Judas Priest vocalist Ripper Owens' group Beyond Fear. Most hardcore bands don't have solo passages that sound like they could be lifted from K.K. Downing's playbook, and this is especially true on “Psychic Vampire” and “I Recommend Amputation"". Even if they're tight, they're not stiff. Ringworm's hardcore side comes out most on “Exit Life"", the shortest song on the record at 1:44. There's no break in the intensity, especially in the blastbeats that follow the intro.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Like other NYHC influenced groups, Ringworm place emphasis on the breakdown. “One of Us Is Going to Die” in particular will make you visualize a battle scene at This is Hardcore or Chaos in Tejas, limbs flying without actually being torn off. “Leave Your Skin at the Door” has a breakdown that is a bit doomier, but no less ripe for mayhem. You can see where Power Trip got some of their cues from. While Ringworm have remained steady over the years, their one true constant is vocalist James “Human Furnace” Bulloch, the group's sole original member. Even given the group's break in the late 90s, it's astonishing he's held on his voice this long. Most new jack Southern Lord hardcore dudes try to sound mad; Bulloch actually is pissed. You can hear him spit at the end of “We'll Always Have The End"", a small bit of personality on the record. </span><i></i></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>Witch</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is a solid record throughout, but it is one of those records that feels like a collection of songs—good songs!—rather than an actual album. It doesn't have an appropriate bookend, an appropriate closing. The record just kind of... stops. However, that might not matter when you're practicing freelance dentistry with a stage and a floor at a Ringworm show.</span></p></div>"|19105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19105-ringworm-hammer-of-the-witch/|7.0|Andy O'Connor

Madlib's </span><span><i>Remixes</i> </span><span>albums put his beats in a street-rap context, giving his esoteric, dusty-sample imprint to cuts like </span><a href=""http://youtu.be/RUz2k2KSplA?t=39m8s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Kurupt's ""Who Ride Wit Us""</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDrRmVxK8bo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>the Noreaga verse on ""Misery Loves Company""</span></a><span>. And while Gibbs has thrived when his voice cuts through updated G-funk or soul-chromed Southern bounce, he's also sounded at home on the boom-bap-leaning East Coast beats of Statik Selektah (</span><i>Lord Giveth, Lord Taketh Away</i><span>) and the more blunted second half of </span><i>Baby Face Killa</i><span>. The team unofficially known as MadGibbs is a somewhat unexpected pairing, maybe a bit outside the usual, but the notion of Gibbs spitting over Madlib's dank obscuro-soul breaks became easier to understand before </span><i>Piñata </i><span>even came out.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The question, then, isn't whether Gibbs and Madlib make a compatible match, but what that match winds up motivating Gibbs to say. </span><i>Piñata </i><span>isn't a major lyrical departure from the last-real-gangsta-standing attitude that's kept Gibbs defiantly his own unfiltered self over the last five years. But his tendency to let the beat inspire certain facets of his writing has resulted in a record that, true to the underheard yet memory-stirring undercurrents of Madlib's production source material, is fueled by a certain kind of grown-man reflection. There's a deep awareness of how the embattled dealer from Gary has and hasn't changed on the way to becoming an L.A.-based enthusiast's favorite—renowned enough to get Scarface and Raekwon on his record, but for reasons that run deeper than just having famous co-signs. Many of Gibbs' lyrics on </span><i>Piñata </i><span>ride a line between pride in his own resilient hustle and ambivalence about what he did to succeed—maybe not guilt, but at least a concerted effort to confront his colder impulses. His stories of a talented man making his way in a bleak environment are brought up without either glamorization or moralizing, but they still feel human. Funk-fusion and soul jazz breaks bubble and blister in the heat, throbbing like a running man's pulse, and Gibbs states the facts as he sees them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Gibbs is nothing if not an anti-bullshit activist, even if it means casting the occasional doubt upon himself or staring down his own contradictions. There's a great line on ""Deeper"" where he abruptly gets introspective after he confronts a woman who got pregnant by another man while Gibbs was in jail—""Maybe you's a stank ho, maybe that's a bit mean/ Maybe you grew up and I'm still livin' like I'm sixteen""—and a taut verse on ""Broken"" that address the supposed irony of having a cop for a father (""I'm a crook and you crooked, that's all we had in common""). Those are just a couple highlights; so many of </span><i>Piñata</i><span>'s best moments are fueled by this sense that Gibbs knows he did wrong but also knows that letting any remorse slip would've potentially made him look weak. There's also a bit of triumph in there somewhere, not in the fact of what he's done and seen, but in the basic fact of his still being around to relay these things. This is a record that sounds really lived-in, in both the sense that it's been steadily labored over and the sense that it's focused on the personal details that come with years of weighted memories. <br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are other cuts that focus more on the man Gibbs is now than the situation that made him, and they don't lack for urgency, either. ""Real"" is Gibbs' Young Jeezy dis track, which stands out as razor's-edge wrath in a hip-hop world that mostly sticks to subtweeting and passive-aggressive maneuvers; that it's based in actual creative grievances and personal fallout instead of just hearsay and general disrespect only makes the lacerations deeper. Paired together, ""Lakers"" and ""Knicks"" draws a straight line from his current pilgrimage-paying L.A. transplant status back to the early-days nickel-bag hustle that first proved his motivation. Even when he's doing a smoker's anthem—the blissed-out ""High,"" featuring a characteristically hyperactive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>—there's an efficiently punchy energy that makes him sound ready to take on all comers. It's the same kind of energy that puts him on the same level as Chef (""Bomb"") and Mr. Scarface (""Broken"") when it comes to vivid crime-life narrative, lets him play virtuoso shit-talk mentor to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Domo Genesis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt</a> (""Robes""), and has him leave such a dominant impression that it makes the otherwise-solid title-track closer seem like a mood-breaking outlier simply because it goes too many bars without his voice.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The way Gibbs uses that voice in the context of the production that deserves special attention here. Gibbs' acknowledged debt to 2Pac is paid back with a versatile, musical flow that seeps into and builds up the structure of the Madlib beats beneath it; his tendency to use the same intonation for both intricately tight-knit verses and simple, to-the-point hooks highlights just how skilled he is at both. He went in and challenged himself to rap fluidly over under-quantized drums and succeeds to the point where it feels like he snaps them into place himself.

Studios in Seattle, recounts the liner notes of the new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4427-unwound/"" target=""_blank"">Unwound</a> box set <i>Rat Conspiracy</i>, when the trio of drummer Sara Lund, bassist Vern Rumsey, and singer-guitarist Justin Trosper convened there in March of 1994 to mix their album <i>New Plastic Ideas</i>. After hours upon hours at the board, it got to be too much. Mingling with the perpetual pall of stale cigarette smoke in the studio, the stench of decomposing rodent was so bad that Lund had to run outside just to catch her breath.</p>
<p>Murky, anxious, asphyxiating: That’s the atmosphere <i>New Plastic Ideas—</i>and its 1993 predecessor <i>Fake Train</i>—conveys. The Olympia-based band had recorded and aborted what would have been their debut 12” in 1992, originally slated for the new local label Kill Rock Stars, but drummer Brandt Sandeno had quit before it could come out. The album was shelved (later to be released as <i>Unwound</i>, included in the recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18356-unwound-kid-is-gone/""><i>Kid Is Gone</i></a> box set) and Lund was brought aboard. Her liquid, unhurried drumming only added to the group’s gooey undertow. Old songs were scrapped and new ones written to accommodate this uncharted chemistry. It seemed to seep everywhere at once—grunge, pigfuck, indie-rock, post-hardcore, punk—collecting residue as it went along. In a decade where anti-packaging was the ultimate irony, Unwound cloaked itself in the dirty earnestness of necessity.</p>
<p><i>Rat Conspiracy</i> collects <i>Fake Train</i> and <i>New Plastic Ideas</i> along with a third album of 7” singles, radio sessions, compilation appearances, and unreleased tracks from 1993 and 1994. Together they comprise Unwound’s first true statement. It’s a garbled one. From the lazily sadistic whiplash of “Dragnalus” to strangulated stasis of “Feeling$ Real”, <i>Fake Train </i>lurches, twists, and turns in on itself, as if manifesting some perverse, extended metaphor for the feedback that laces nearly ever track. “I don’t feel strange/ I don’t feel at all”, Trosper mumbles on “Dragnalus” like a kid made to stand in the corner. Then he screams his fucking face off.</p>
<p>That drift between hesitance and horror underscores “Lucky Acid,” in which Trosper’s vocals wander in as if the mic got turned on too late; soon the muted jangle of his guitar swells into a Morse-code distress call banged out on naked nerve endings. And the trilogy of “Valentine Card”, “Kantina”, and “Were, Are and Was or Is”—<i>Fake Train</i>’s own “The Wonder”, “Hyperstation”, and “Eliminator Jr.”—not only mimic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a> in structure, but in the delicate, dissonant, <i>Daydream Nation</i>-esque instrumental “Were, Are and Was or Is”. But Rumsey’s blood-chugging bass line on “Valentine Card” is pure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"" target=""_blank"">Jesus Lizard</a>, even as Lund’s impressionistic percussion dots the rhythm.</p>
<p>There’s sausage being made here, but gristle keep clogging up the grinder. “Ratbite”, the album’s lone hardcore song, comes on like an homage to Wire’s “1 2 X U” as filtered through <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAMVGvCuV3I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Minor Threat</a> and a broken bottle of Robitussin. Vintage punk gets more directly referenced on the bonus track “Census,” a cavernous noise spasm from 1994’s “Negated” 7” that ends with a sample of Billy Idol’s goofy line “A heavy heavy dub, punk rockers!” from the throwaway Generation X song “Wild Dub,” a dub version of their 1978 song “Wild Youth.” Echoes of echoes of echoes—yet with Unwound they congeal into a fugue of fucked-up signifiers as thick with collagist subversion as <i>Fake Train</i>’s Tom Jones-on-Sun Ra <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Unwound_-_Fake_Train.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover art</a>.</p>
<p>Of the remaining bonus tracks, “Unsympathetica”, “Untitled 1”, and “Untitled 2” are previously unreleased. All three are napkin-drawn blueprints for songs that never were. Together they shed light on Unwound’s shambolic writing process, a jam-based unraveling of knots of ideas rather than an act of construction. “Untitled 2” goes so far as to verge on start-stop, hard-rock swagger, more the area of expertise of Unwound’s close friends and contemporaries Karp. The sludge-shoveling “Mkultra”, from the 7” of the same name, could have even been a Karp cover. <i>Rat Conspiracy</i>’s only actual cover, though, is of the Minutemen’s “Plight”—and its throbbing atmospherics, entwined voices, and elegant spirals of abrasion are treated as both tribute and birthright.</p>
<p><i>New Plastic Ideas</i> is less a product of its input and more of a refinement of its lack thereof—a process of weeding out, as it were, regarding Unwound’s blatant inspirations (Black Flag very much among them). There’s a huge leap in articulation here, both in gesture and enunciation, from <i>Fake Train</i>. “Entirely Different Matters” masters one of Trosper’s guitar trademarks, a layered, symphonic squeal of opening feedback, while “Usual Dosage” does the same for another, the crystalline dissonance of harmonics. But the dynamics refuse to lapse into patterns, as the pinpoint noise-squibs made predictable by Fugazi are deployed with counterintuitive chaos. On “Envelope”—one of Unwound’s most indelible songs, a study in inverted, charred-hearted near-pop—melody morphs into menace and is never resolved. By the time the seven-minute sprawl of “Abstraktions” (which features Fisk on keyboards) veers down a harrowing, Side-Two-of-Joy-Division’s-<i>Closer</i> corridor, the shape of Unwound to come has been all but sketched out.</p>
<p>Seeing Unwound in a freezing warehouse in the mid-90s was glimpse into that future. Wrapped in ratty scarves, playing with fingerless gloves, their breaths curling like smog in the frigid cold, they lugged around with them a miasma of sourness. Their music didn’t move the air in the room so much as curdle it. Their records to date—meticulously overdubbed, immaculately raw—had not been ample warning. What the hell was going on? This was a DIY punk show; it was supposed to feel in some way collective and cathartic. Instead—like Lund in the mixing room during the <i>New Plastic Ideas</i> sessions—those of us in the sparse audience were struck numb and left gasping for oxygen. Unwound had sucked it all in, stunk it all up, fed it back to us as a sad, blackened racket.</p>
<p><i>Fake Train</i> and <i>New Plastic Ideas </i>hold important places in the history of 90s music, not to mention those of punk and indie as a whole. And they set the tone for unimagined Unwound greatness to come (which will be chronicled in subsequent volumes of the box-set series). But those two albums, and the tracks that accompany them on <i>Rat Conspiracy</i>, transcend time, place, attitude, and even the sprawling continuum of influence. More than any other records of their generation, they embody a paradox that disaffected youth has been stabbing at since the advent of rock ’n’ roll: how it feels to be cocooned among strangers in utter alienation, yet stand as one.</p></div>"|19090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19090-unwound-rat-conspiracy/|9.1|Jason Heller

Accordingly, there’s an atmosphere of perpetual suspension and too many transatlantic flights to the band’s sixth full-length <i>The Take Off and Landing of Everything</i>. Not that Garvey, from the album’s title on down, seems to be trying to encrypt that theme. After the morbid nostalgia of 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15178-build-a-rocket-boys/"" target=""_blank""><i>Build a Rocket Boys!</i></a>, there’s a softer, rounder, lighter obviousness to <i>Take Off</i>. The arrangements are even more porous; the melodies less terrestrial. But where <i>Build a Rocket Boys!</i> meditated on youth, the new album dwells on, well, take offs and landings as analogs of life and death like that parallel is the most clever thing anyone’s ever thought of.</p>
<p>Yes, Garvey’s symbology has gotten that much more sodden and heavy-handed, even as <i>Take Off</i> steadfastly sheds mass. On “Fly Boy Blue/ Lunette”, he’s traded in his rockets for the drudgery of commercial flight with all its degradation of wonder. Garvey’s in-flight movie may have been <i>Up in the Air</i> one too many times. Singing “I’m reaching the age where decisions are made on the life and the liver,"" he falls back on the bottle as a totem of existential boredom. His voice itself—numb, null, narcotic—spreads its warmth around that imagistic mixology. “So bring your faces/ Home to my sweet trampoline/ And acres of crash site love,"" he waxes later in “Fly Boy Blue/ Lunette”, and only the song’s bittersweet orchestral swells save it from falling out of the sky.</p>
<p>Moments of greatness come, just not often enough. The contorted syncopation and signature-twiddling of “Charge”—as well as its thick keys and dehydrated guitar—establish some real counterpoint and tension, elements the album otherwise mostly lacks. And Garvey’s in-character narrative summons pathos, tangible rage, and the entitled bitterness of old age and memory. He bites off words, chews them, spits; Roger Waters circa <i>The Final Cut</i> might have been proud. It complements <i>Take Off</i>’s other standout, its title track, a wash of throbbing, “Tomorrow Never Knows”-esque psychedelia that also channels Garvey’s most open inspiration of late, Peter Gabriel.</p>
<p>Those gains are almost entirely erased by lusterless lumps like “Honey Sun”, a song that begins promisingly with a clip of off-the-cuff studio hijinks before devolving into Elbow’s longtime default setting: a discrete if uninentional reimagining of Blur’s “Tender,” in all its crowd-baiting, platitudinous blankness. “Can I jump in the gun/ And fly/ Over the ocean” goes Garvey’s obligatory air-travel reference as he lands his 747-sized sentimentalism right on the nose. Perhaps it’s deliberate that throughout <i>The Take Off and Landing of Everything</i>, hardly anything truly takes off. Instead the album dangles there, an effortlessly leaden exhibition of glum triumphalism—and an example of what makes Elbow, at its least potent, so subtly unsubtle.</p></div>"|19108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19108-elbow-the-take-off-and-landing-of-everything/|6.2|Jason Heller

The songwriting duo of Paul Wittmann-Todd and Sacha Maxim met during a show at a Seattle lesbian bar and decided to collaborate because the former ""<a href=""http://thegreyestates.com/2014/02/28/interview-posse/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">didn't have a lot of other options</a>."" On their sophomore album <i>Soft Opening,</i> Wittmann-Todd and Maxim exhibit that same kind of non-committal camaraderie, as their vocals do not harmonize or intertwine or do battle; most of the time, they exchange one-sided conversations, acknowledging each other and going about their business. Every instrument is given enough space to do whatever it wants as long as it cleans up after itself. It's the musical equivalent of roommates who randomly linked up on Craigslist and totally worked things out. Whatever qualities this might suggest in Posse as people lend a lived-in bumminess to <i>Soft Opening</i>, imbuing its no-frills, rumpled indie rock with a discernible point of view and more importantly, a personality.</div>
<p dir=""ltr"">That’s important, because this is <i>really</i> no-frills indie rock. The most notable studio tricks Posse employ are a fuzz pedal, a tambourine, and the occasional echo on Maxim’s vocals. Either Wittmann-Todd is playing an extremely avant-garde solo during a portion of “Jon” or they simply didn’t feel like overdubbing a flubbed take. On the up-tempo numbers, Posse recall a rainy day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>, a less bookish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo"" target=""_blank"">Yo La Tengo</a> driven by a equivocal, platonic friendship. On slower-than-slowcore “Talk"", they’re all but mesmerized by their own torpor, situated somewhere in between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>’s “Stop Breathing” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill</a>’s “Cleo” in terms of uncomfortably numb guitar heroism. Similar to those bands, Posse make music that is lo-fi without sounding cheap, purposeful minimalism that can sound strangely expansive: Maxim and Wittmann-Todd’s vocals are barely projected without being off-key, and the guitar leads have an effortless melodicism whenever they take over. Even if most of these songs could be strummed out from a beanbag chair, Posse always add a chord that fancies things up just enough.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Posse describe their sound as “delay pedals and 27 years of disappointment”, which may not be factually correct; you hear a lot more of the latter than the former, and the second line of opener “Interesting Thing No. 2” is “You turned 25, so many things you haven’t tried.” It’s theoretically sound all the same, since <i>Soft Opening</i>’s self-deprecation is a big part of its appeal. For all of its invocations of 80s and 90s A-listers, <i>Soft Opening</i> is an of-the-moment record in the way it aligns with the sort of sitcoms that dominate the viewing habits of people Posse’s age: the actors involved are presented as friends, yet they don’t really seem to like each other all that much.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In the case of <i>Soft Opening</i>, nearly every song is a subtly hilarious metacommentary on some sort of communication breakdown. Maxim sings, “I know you’re gonna talk through this and not care,” and you can easily visualize the shoulder shrug, the eye-rolling, the internal defeat she anticipates with this interaction. With every repetition, it cuts deeper and deeper as an insult: you are someone who simply can’t handle sitting in silence with their own feelings. A song later on “Shut Up”, a drunk and bored Wittmann-Todd fantasizes about a time when he’s going to work up the nerve to tell someone to shut their yap, even if it’s himself: “I’m gonna watch you go outside now/ And make a stupid face/ And shut up.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And yet, none of this venting comes off as mean-spirited. In fact, most of <i>Soft Opening</i> unwinds with the casual bonhomie of three post-work beers over darts; the deleterious effects are minimal compared to the necessary release and bonding. And hell, if Posse seem to have a strange enjoyment for each other’s company in spite of it all, well, it’s because the outside world doesn’t have that much more to offer. “Cassandra B.” relates a date between overeducated, underfunded Seattlites as they down too much vodka, go to an “intelligent rap” show (“A bald white guy/ With a mumu onstage”) and lie about reading Willa Cather books that were bought at college and promptly shelved. As with every dryly hysterical line on <i>Soft Opening</i>, there’s never any “pitchiness”; it’s never trying to be any more droll and absurd than life itself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the litany of disappointments, misunderstandings, and aimlessness befalling the narrators in these songs, <i>Soft Opening</i> is a record of oddly stoic presence. For one thing, the austere sonics and plainspoken lyrics ensure that nothing gets glossed overso it's a tough record to tune out. But also, Posse sound exactly like the band they want to be—you don’t sense any musical ambition unmet, any word misplaced. It’s a modest record done confidently, enough to end with a six-minute guitar workout based around the lyric that perfectly encapsulates <i>Soft Opening</i>’s comforting sadness, its satisfied misanthropy: “Don’t touch me/ I’m in my zone.”</p></div>"|19132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19132-posse-soft-opening/|7.9|Ian Cohen

But whether he was reinterpreting George Harrison with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a> or Guns 'N Roses with Luna, it never felt like Wareham was just showing off his record collection for the sake of it, or worse, being ironic. Rather, he was asserting his platonic ideal of pop music, separating iconic artists from their historical baggage, and distilling the songs down to the intimate, personal connection and details that made him an enthusiast in the first place. It’s an approach that went into overdrive with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4555-dean-britta/"" target=""_blank"">Dean &amp; Britta</a>, Wareham’s mid-2000s collaboration with ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2554-luna/"" target=""_blank"">Luna</a>-bassist-turned-wife Britta Phillips; the couple’s covers-stacked releases captured the sound of newlyweds rolling around on the living-room floor amid piles of their favorite 45s during a red wine-fueled all-nighter. But, naturally, every nocturnal reverie must be followed by a moment when you have to face the day again.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to read into the fact that, following that seemingly successful musical and matrimonial partnership, Wareham is now releasing records under his own name for the first time in his nearly three-decade career. While Phillips is still in the picture, she’s reverted from star-player status to a background role amid Wareham’s <i>mise en scene</i>. Her presence as a muse, however, is as powerful as ever: Like last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18636-dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Emancipated Hearts</i> EP</a>, Wareham’s new self-titled full-length is less Dean &amp; Britta than Dean <i>to</i> Britta. It’s an album that humorously but honestly explores the tensions that arise in any long-term relationship, however in this case, the pressures—financial, political, or otherwise—seem to be coming more from without than within. “I’m living in a holding pattern,” Wareham confesses on the album’s deceptively sprightly centerpiece “Holding Pattern”, but it’s not the proverbial seven-year itch that’s nagging at him so much as the humdrum, 9-to-5 uniformity of modern American life, where even in an era of “drop-down menus,” it can be hard to distinguish sports-ticker reports from the 1970s arena-rock dinosaurs still clogging up the FM airwaves (“Kansas, Boston, Toto, Journey, Foreigner, and Styx/ San Diego over Denver 17 to 6”).</p>
<p>In the face of such demoralizing conditions, it can be hard to keep one’s spirits up even in a happy coupling, but the standout tracks here suggest that, while it may be unsentimental to think of relationship as work, it’s the sort of labor that yields rewards: “We’ll love you in the lean times,” Wareham assures on “My Eyes Are Blue”, a song whose title evokes <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcDuR9BF0Oc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a classic track by his beloved Velvet Underground</a>, but whose winsome jangle sounds more like the sort of early-60s pop confections Lou Reed would’ve cranked out in his pre-VU song-factory stint. And as Wareham observes, in a world dominated by “Heartless People”, romanticism becomes akin to radicalism—when he sings, “You and I/ Hate to see a flower die,” it’s less an expression of twee-as-fuck sensitivity than a defiant assertion of one’s humanity even as the bastards try to get you down.</p>
<p>Once again, Wareham’s turned to his record collection for emotional guidance, though instead of simply covering some of his favorite artists, he’s taken to enlisting younger contemporaries as collaborators. On <i>Emancipated Hearts</i>, he ceded the console to Jason Quever, aka Sub Pop indie-pop savant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5127-papercuts/"" target=""_blank"">Papercuts</a>, and for this more sonically elaborate recording, he's given himself over to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"" target=""_blank"">My Morning Jacket</a>’s Jim James, a relationship that dates back to Wareham’s obsession with MMJ’s 1999 debut, <i>The Tennessee Fire</i>. Though James’ aesthetic has obviously evolved greatly from the rustic simplicity of that album, his name is still synonymous with a certain strain of cosmic Americana, and the sparkling, synth-washed productions of “Beat the Devil” and “Love Is Not a Roof Against the Rain” balance the retro and futurist in a fashion reminiscent of post-<i>Deserter’s Songs</i> Mercury Rev, providing Wareham with the cocoon-like insulation from the outside world he seeks.</p>
<p>But, perhaps owing to Wareham’s recent acts of self-reflection—penning an autobiography, dusting off Galaxie 500 standards in concert—this album functions firmly within the various comfort zones he's inhabited over the years, spanning the dreamy drone of his first band (see: “Babes in the Woods”, featuring a rare showing of Wareham’s long-dormant falsetto) to the sort of electronic-inflected pop he toyed with in Dean &amp; Britta. Given the dichotomy between Wareham’s dry, plainspoken demeanor and James’ shoot-for-the-stratosphere tendencies, this album is an epic of modest proportions, a Pocketbook Dean Wareham to go with your <i>Portable Galaxie 500</i>. In more calculated hands, the pulsating groove of the closing “Happy &amp; Free” could be elevated into a “With Or Without You”-sized anthem, but Wareham is content to just calmly ride it out at his patient pace, and enjoy the moment of peace—because he knows it won’t last. He may claim he’s “happy and free,” but he adds, with typically understated sardonicism, “for a while.” And, as ever, the least his songs can do is make those short whiles feel like they could last forever. </p></div>"|19098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19098-dean-wareham-dean-wareham/|7.5|Stuart Berman

To his left is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>, a kid climbing the ranks and finding chart success despite—or with the help of—his soft Canadian heart and stint as a television actor. To his right is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a>, the Queens-bred Trinidadian princess with a handful of dextrous features and a couple of fireball mixtapes behind her, the “Monster” verse still to come. Supervised by Birdman, they’re surrounded by a gaggle of hyperactive oddballs, a motley crew that compensates for its lack of raw skill and starpower with versatility, sheer enthusiasm, and tiger-print pants. They <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha80ZaecGkQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">post up in a mansion like it’s summer camp</a>, playing foosball and squirting each other with water guns. Morale and camaraderie is high, and they sound as though they’re having a ton of fun.  </p>
<p>Young Money, 2014: Lil Wayne, for all intents and purposes, is a fallen hero after a long string of unrecognizably weak projects. His duo of star underlings, however, have scaled the heights of both rap and pop and helped build powerful bridges between the two. Their supporting motley crew is still essentially the same supporting motley crew, if a bit thinned out and dramatically less excitable. Whereas 2009’s compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13810-we-are-young-money/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Are Young Money</i></a> found Wayne and his cohort proudly kicking open doors and announcing their plans for world domination with jester-like sneers and grins, <i>Rise of an Empire</i> positions Young Money as a collective unsmilingly guarding its moneyed perch. “Long as we living right/ Then we alright/ Long as it’s high life/ Then we alright,” goes the bridge of “We Alright”, a lead single tinged with the paranoia of a pack of artists taking stock of exactly what they’ve still got in their collective grasp.</p>
<p>If <i>Rise of an Empire</i> is meant to read like some kind of State of the Union address, it paints Young Money as a fractured team that’s lost its compass. Minaj and Drake have fallen so far out of the orbit of Young Money’s pedestrian rings that their contributions almost feel like charity—Drake’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53459-listen-drake-trophies/"" target=""_blank"">“Trophies”</a> appears on the project months after he released the song for free on SoundCloud through his own OVO imprint. Nicki Minaj’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53946-video-nicki-minaj-lookin-ass-nigga/"" target=""_blank"">“Lookin’ Ass”</a>, which she released along with a brutal, artfully shot black-and-white video last month, feels similarly detached from the rest of the compilation, and reads more like a promotion for her forthcoming studio album. Both tracks are highlights and sonic outliers on <i>Rise of an Empire</i>, and they stand in sharp contrast to the rest of the compilation, which—beyond the typical unevenness of any crew album—is largely joyless and anonymous.</p>
<p>The group’s youngest rapper, Lil Twist—who’s gained more of a reputation through his misadventures with Justin Bieber than anything else he’s done in recent years—boasts about hanging with Atlanta’s Rich Homie Quan and 2 Chainz rather than Lil Wayne on a song “Bang”. Yes, “Bang”, a hollow retooling of the song that put drill kingpin Chief Keef on the map. Even Tyga, who created a legitimate ripple in the rap pond a couple of years ago with “Rack City” and followed through with a decent album, sounds bored. The only figure with real energy is new Young Money signee Euro, a rapper with an unfortunate name but an imperious presence. But on his boastful coming-out statement “Induction Speech,” he sounds aware of his diminished surroundings: “I flew afternoon and made it by night/ I landed/ The flight was amazing/ I just stayed up and write,” he raps about his arrival, before confessing: “Chauffeur was waiting with a sign/ Except my name wasn’t right.” He goes on to crack about forgetting to text Mack Maine, Young Money’s effective director of operations, once he’s gotten in town.</p>
<p>Lil Wayne, who's allegedly gearing up to release the fifth installment of <i>Tha Carter</i>, sums up <i>Rise of an Empire</i> pretty tidily on ""Moment"": ""Lately all I been doing is celebrating/ Don't even know why I'm celebrating."" But he certainly has one reason to celebrate: Drake and Minaj, despite their evident drift from the day-to-day operations of Young Money, remain deeply loyal to he and Birdman. A DVD released along with the deluxe edition of Nicki Minaj’s last album pictures her alongside Wayne, presenting him with a brand new car for his birthday and faithfully referring to him as the President. She and Drake clearly remember the days when they were lucky to have Young Money. <i>Rise of an Empire</i> paints a different picture, one that emphasizes exactly how lucky Young Money is to still have them. </p></div>"|19072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19072-young-money-rise-of-an-empire/|4.9|Carrie Battan

Walker emerged in the mid-60s as an adventurous multi-instrumentalist, a peripatetic polyglot whose enthusiasms would ultimately make him a student of both <a href=""http://www.aacm.org/school_faculty_aak.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ali Akbar Khan</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dustedmagazine.com%2Ffeatures%2F534&amp;ei=4GsaU6mQE4LR0wHa3oGoCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDxsq9T5xt0BruVokYczQd4Lh7tA&amp;sig2=90Z2h626ttslAl-c5fNl4Q&amp;bvm=bv.62578216,d.dmQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">flamenco guitar, plus the musical pied piper</a> to Timothy Leary’s lysergic Millbrook hideaway. His tunes epitomize late-60s psychedelic experimentation, with tufts of notes from his nylon-string guitar or sarod blooming into ecstatic bliss. But Bob Frank was a Tennessee kid who liked the blues and country music, Bob Dylan and Gordon Lightfoot. He’d tried to write commercial hits in Nashville, but his sharp-penned historical ruminations and lyrical snapshots never climbed any charts, due in part to his own obstinacy about them. One seemed to be the Okie From Muskogee, the other the dope-smoking California hippy who would’ve been arrested on his way through town.</p>
<p>But Walker’s second album, “<i>Second Poem to Karmela,” or Gypsies Are Important</i>, and Frank’s self-titled debut are the first two titles of an exciting new series from the resurrection-prone imprint Light in the Attic, in which they will raid the deepest vaults of Vanguard Records. Established in 1947, <a href=""http://www.bsnpubs.com/new/vanguard.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vanguard served as an essential syndicate for the folk music of the world</a>, with albums from The Weavers and Doc Watson and Joan Baez countered by recordings from Israel and Norway and Asia. It’s one of the most intimidating catalogues in American music history, a story as rich as those of Paramount or Okeh.</p>
<p>Something that Walker and Frank <i>did </i>share was a deep disinterest in playing their record label’s commercial games. As they both recount in the extensive first-person liner notes included in each reissue, they made decisions after the release of their respective albums they knew would get them blacklisted. At an album release concert in New York, Vanguard co-founder Maynard Solomon told Frank to play something from the new record. “If anybody wants to hear the songs off the album, let ’em go buy the fucking album!” he said. Not long before Walker recorded <i>Second Poem</i>, he canceled a string of gigs to study with Khan, a move that dismayed the label but gave him the technical abilities necessary to make the album at all. “You’ll never work again!” they told him. In both cases, these LPs were the last that either musician released for the next 30 years, as both retreated into the private lives of raising their families and quietly building their craft. During the last decade, both Walker and Frank have released more music than in the previous half-century combined, meaning these two albums at least share something else: Though they seemed to be endpoints, they are both now unlikely new beginnings.</p>
<p>Bob Frank was an outlaw songwriter’s outlaw songwriter, a Vietnam veteran and graduate school dropout who had been too stubborn to make it as part of the Nashville music machine. He was tougher than Kristofferson and more spry than Cash, an often-jolly light in typically dark corners. He delighted in trouble, did every drug, wasted most weekends. “Memphis Jail"", which closes this debut, might start like a blues, with the protagonist waiting to be released from his jail cell. But the despair is a feint, as the police have only arrested the rebel for public inebriation. They have no idea he stole a car, too. “I got off light,” he whoops, a smile evident in his voice, “considering how bad I am.” The quest for a little more weed leads to stringband delight during “She Pawned Her Diamond for Some Gold"", an ode to any partner willing to sell jewelry for a joint. And “Layin’ Around” extends the bucolic vision of escape that infiltrated American and European roots music of the moment—a modicum of success that allows for family, some comfort, “a place of my own.” It’s a portrait of the wild one, coming home to roost. “I circled around and I wound up here,” he croons. “A good place to be this time of the year.”</p>
<p>The record lasts just longer than 30 minutes, but if it feels lengthier and weightier than that, it’s because Frank relates his characters with such strength and poignancy. Some of these sketches are autobiographical and some observational, but all are rich with the annals of real life, little details that pull these people off of the page or out of the record’s black groove. You know what “Wino” drinks and how he smells, where he sleeps and what rodents can’t scare him. “Jones and Me” is a snapshot of a catch-up conversation Frank once had with a friend. In less than two minutes, you learn about their boredom and their anxieties, their preference for booze and their predilections for distraction. It’s as though you’re barside, sitting between the two. Even “Judas Iscariot"", an allegory of Jesus and the disciple who <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_of_Judas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">betrayed</a> him, feels like an account of yesterday; Frank recasts the Biblical pair as booze-and-weed buddies, drunk at a party and given to the sort of philosophically deep conversations that tend to happen when all the wine is gone. Judas wasn’t a traitor, Frank suggests, but simply misunderstood by a friend too buzzed to listen. You want to stop and ponder these people, to consider them as they might have been.</p>
<p>Unlike Frank, Walker enjoyed some of the perks of being a Vanguard artist before mostly disappearing. His debut, <i>Rainy Day Raga</i>, emerged in 1966, just as John Fahey’s Takoma Records was gaining momentum and as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t79aI-I6ucA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles began to slip under the thrall of Indian music</a>. He flirted with the zeitgeist; in fact, Walker—for that part of his life, a fortuitous friend of the famous—studied under Ravi Shankar alongside Beatle George Harrison. “It was like a bull by the tail, like a rocket ride, and all you could do was hang on,” he says of the period following <i>Rainy Day</i>’s release in an extensive interview by Glenn Jones that’s included with this reissue. Only two years passed between <i>Rainy Day </i>and its follow-up, <i>Second Poem</i>, but they are worlds apart in source and intention. Despite the <i>Raga </i>reference of his debut’s title, Walker was just learning about Indian music, a young white man from Massachusetts with a guitar. But he studied with Khan in the interim, and <i>Second Poem</i> is delivered mostly with sarod, the guitar showing up intermittently. Nearly half a century since its release, the material remains intoxicatingly nebulous.</p>
<p>Indeed, these 10 pieces often feel as though they’re about to burst, to split the seams of the gathered ensemble wide open. During “Circus Day,” Walker works through a patient sarod circuit, trading lines with Jim Pepper’s flute. When the rhythm arrives, they charge ahead, their melodies wrapping constantly around one another. At one point toward the song’s midsection, it feels as if they’ve all lost the plot and are just playing for the thrill of the sound, not unlike <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Albert-Ayler-In-Greenwich-Village/release/1267710"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Albert Ayler with his two-bass-and-violin band.</a> They pull it together, though, winding slowly toward the song’s fading end. “Blake Street"", which follows, is a short, ascendant piece for guitar, a salve after a storm. Indeed, such shifts in momentum and dynamics are a hallmark of <i>Second Poem</i>. The group smolders over the tamboura drone of “I &amp; Thou” but leaps briefly into hyperkinetic passages. “Southwind” cycles from a lonely sarod meditation into a tense duel with the violin of John Blair.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Second Poem</i>, you can hear Walker test the bounds of his own experimental realm, his instruments pressing against the possibilities of the moment.  The closing “Mixture” is an ominous and enigmatic improvisation for keyboards, violin, tabla, sarod and sitar, where the various players puzzle out in real-time how these elements might work with one another. Remember, this was 1968. Walker made another album after <i>Second Poem</i>, <a href=""http://blog.lightintheattic.net/?p=19611"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1970’s <i>Has Anybody Seen Our Freedoms?</i></a>, though it was only released last year. But it’s more in line with his folk-singer antecedents and solo-guitar contemporaries, not the alien abstraction of <i>Second Poem</i>. Had Walker pursued this path, where might he have arrived?</p>
<p>Light in the Attic’s continued tunneling of Vanguard vaults likely won’t answer those sort of questions, but it will continue to raise them. What’s more, these albums went out of print almost instantly, meaning that they’ve been consistently expensive collector’s items for years. (Despite his seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of this broad school of guitarists, even Jones didn’t know about <i>Second Poem </i>until 2004.) How might music sound if these albums had broken through cult obscurity, if Frank or Walker had behaved? That doesn’t matter: For Frank’s humble <a href=""http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/bob-frank-is-a-cult-hero-even-if-he-doesnt-want-to-be/Content?oid=1203557"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">documents of the commoner</a>, and for Walker’s willful exploration of the fringes, this material demands to be heard by wider audiences. Now, they share that chance.</p></div>"|19063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19063-peter-walker-bob-frank-second-poem-to-karmela-or-gypsies-are-important-bob-frank/|8.3|Grayson Haver Currin

It’s as though you’re barside, sitting between the two. Even “Judas Iscariot"", an allegory of Jesus and the disciple who <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_of_Judas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">betrayed</a> him, feels like an account of yesterday; Frank recasts the Biblical pair as booze-and-weed buddies, drunk at a party and given to the sort of philosophically deep conversations that tend to happen when all the wine is gone. Judas wasn’t a traitor, Frank suggests, but simply misunderstood by a friend too buzzed to listen. You want to stop and ponder these people, to consider them as they might have been.</p>
<p>Unlike Frank, Walker enjoyed some of the perks of being a Vanguard artist before mostly disappearing. His debut, <i>Rainy Day Raga</i>, emerged in 1966, just as John Fahey’s Takoma Records was gaining momentum and as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t79aI-I6ucA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles began to slip under the thrall of Indian music</a>. He flirted with the zeitgeist; in fact, Walker—for that part of his life, a fortuitous friend of the famous—studied under Ravi Shankar alongside Beatle George Harrison. “It was like a bull by the tail, like a rocket ride, and all you could do was hang on,” he says of the period following <i>Rainy Day</i>’s release in an extensive interview by Glenn Jones that’s included with this reissue. Only two years passed between <i>Rainy Day </i>and its follow-up, <i>Second Poem</i>, but they are worlds apart in source and intention. Despite the <i>Raga </i>reference of his debut’s title, Walker was just learning about Indian music, a young white man from Massachusetts with a guitar. But he studied with Khan in the interim, and <i>Second Poem</i> is delivered mostly with sarod, the guitar showing up intermittently. Nearly half a century since its release, the material remains intoxicatingly nebulous.</p>
<p>Indeed, these 10 pieces often feel as though they’re about to burst, to split the seams of the gathered ensemble wide open. During “Circus Day,” Walker works through a patient sarod circuit, trading lines with Jim Pepper’s flute. When the rhythm arrives, they charge ahead, their melodies wrapping constantly around one another. At one point toward the song’s midsection, it feels as if they’ve all lost the plot and are just playing for the thrill of the sound, not unlike <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Albert-Ayler-In-Greenwich-Village/release/1267710"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Albert Ayler with his two-bass-and-violin band.</a> They pull it together, though, winding slowly toward the song’s fading end. “Blake Street"", which follows, is a short, ascendant piece for guitar, a salve after a storm. Indeed, such shifts in momentum and dynamics are a hallmark of <i>Second Poem</i>. The group smolders over the tamboura drone of “I &amp; Thou” but leaps briefly into hyperkinetic passages. “Southwind” cycles from a lonely sarod meditation into a tense duel with the violin of John Blair.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Second Poem</i>, you can hear Walker test the bounds of his own experimental realm, his instruments pressing against the possibilities of the moment.  The closing “Mixture” is an ominous and enigmatic improvisation for keyboards, violin, tabla, sarod and sitar, where the various players puzzle out in real-time how these elements might work with one another. Remember, this was 1968. Walker made another album after <i>Second Poem</i>, <a href=""http://blog.lightintheattic.net/?p=19611"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1970’s <i>Has Anybody Seen Our Freedoms?</i></a>, though it was only released last year. But it’s more in line with his folk-singer antecedents and solo-guitar contemporaries, not the alien abstraction of <i>Second Poem</i>. Had Walker pursued this path, where might he have arrived?</p>
<p>Light in the Attic’s continued tunneling of Vanguard vaults likely won’t answer those sort of questions, but it will continue to raise them. What’s more, these albums went out of print almost instantly, meaning that they’ve been consistently expensive collector’s items for years. (Despite his seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of this broad school of guitarists, even Jones didn’t know about <i>Second Poem </i>until 2004.) How might music sound if these albums had broken through cult obscurity, if Frank or Walker had behaved? That doesn’t matter: For Frank’s humble <a href=""http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/bob-frank-is-a-cult-hero-even-if-he-doesnt-want-to-be/Content?oid=1203557"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">documents of the commoner</a>, and for Walker’s willful exploration of the fringes, this material demands to be heard by wider audiences. Now, they share that chance.</p></div>"|19063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19063-peter-walker-bob-frank-second-poem-to-karmela-or-gypsies-are-important-bob-frank/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

And when the full-length album began arriving in shops last month, it had about the same amount of info on it. There are eight tracks in total, all of them untitled, released by the Washington, D.C. imprint Peoples Potential Unlimited.</p>
<p>For the PPU label, this is par for the course. Since 2008, PPU’s catalog makes for strange, eclectic listening, primarily reissuing demo recordings from <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?artist=Glass+Pyramid"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the early 80s of African-American acts hoping to be the next Earth Wind and Fire</a> or <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Dwight-Sykes-Songs-Volume-One/release/4433985"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marvin Gaye</a>. The bizarro world of boogie and R&amp;B that PPU unearths—far from the upper echelons of kings like Michael Jackson and Prince— is fascinating stuff and almost any toe dip into the PPU catalog will reward listeners. But the label also releases music from acts similarly informed by such lost musics, be it Tom Noble, Psychic Mirrors or Benedek.</p>
<p>A bit of research revealed that Nicholas Benedek hails from Los Angeles and while he’s had a few cassette-only comp appearances, his only other release available to date is a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"" target=""_blank"">Dâm-Funk</a>. Much like his peer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> and how his hypnagogic pop vision influenced an entire generation of indie-rockers, Dâm-Funk’s aesthetic seems to have had a similar effect on a new generation of post-Dilla producers, drawing on obscure boogie, funk, freestyle, house music, modern soul and lost R&amp;B to create a strange yet danceable new world of sound.</p>
<p>There’s something uncanny and familiar about Benedek’s sound palette across these eight instrumentals: the bubbly synths, the popping basslines, the crisp drum machine hits, the canned handclaps, all of which evoke the production tropes of a bygone era. The first track has this sliver of sound that makes me think of Mr. Mister’s “Broken Wings"", which may just be a trick of the mind akin to Ariel Pink’s, in that it attaches itself to what you have stored in your own musical memory banks. Another section has the warm pads and chopped-up hand percussion reminiscent of a proto-house track, interspersed with chimes. There are sounds that might bring to mind a workout video from the 80s, unless you weren’t born in that decade, in which case the bassline might instead sound like something from the early 90s. The third track features the sort of harmonica preset of an old synth and Jacuzzi-warm keyboard chords, all set against the kind of boom-tick that my girlfriend would call “grown and sexy.”</p>
<p>The fourth untitled track sticks out for me, laced with the kind of hook that could either be from an obscure lite jazz album, a rare modern soul 12,” or some sort of boogie track that might have gotten aired one night at the Paradise Garage, full of airy guitar upstrokes. But perhaps it’s not a sample at all, but rather from the mind and fingers of Benedek himself. His evocative debut, while scrubbed of track titles, vocals and eschewing easy genre categories from the past thirty years, nevertheless makes such blurred lines be part of its listening pleasure.</p></div>"|19084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19084-benedek-untitled-ep/|7.6|Andy Beta

<p dir=""ltr"">Now we have <i>The Parasitic Survival of the Human Race</i>, a blistering suite with a relentless hardcore heartbeat, and a work surrounded on all sides by the sounds of humanity at its most delirious—specifically, the screams and sirens that flooded the streets of Athens during the 2012 riots. A muffled gunshot, the blood-curdling curses of protesters, seas of white noise: chaos seeps into every square inch of interstitial tissue separating the album’s five tracks, sustaining a mob scene for the album’s duration. The motif gets a bit tiresome by record's end, but at least initially, the confusion inherent in this aural overload lends itself well to gut-wrenching surprises like the jagged riff that crashes down a minute into the “Stupid Worthless Sheep”. Aside from providing plenty of thrills, the <i>The Parasitic Survival of the Human Race</i> also boasts the clearest, tightest production on a Dodsferd album to date, continuing the sonic clean-up that began on 2008’s <i>Death Set the Beginning of My Journey</i>. Wrath’s once-garbled screams cut into the din a bit more now, shaking with the organic intensity of a Jacob Bannon or Erlend Hjelvik.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Those extra dashes of punk in the mix lend the album some welcome immediacy, but neither the airtight mixing nor the catchy riffs can mitigate redundancy altogether. On opener “Breeding Chaos”, Nadir seems content to carry meat-and-potatoes hardcore riffs past the point of disinterest, dulling their sawtoothed impact; “Doubting Your Worth” suffers from the same water-treading, spared at the last minute by a teeth-gnashing coda. At a lean, mean three minutes, you'd think the cover of the Misfits’ “We Are 138” that closes the record would be the perfect way to shake off the doldrums of the mammoth tracks that precede it and provide a satisfying, succinct conclusion to the party. It’s a shame that the tribute morphs into a strange game of vocal showboating by the third verse, only to disappear into the apocalyptic Athens soundscapes for good. It’s almost as though Wrath got bored.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And there's the rub: <i>The Parasitic Survival of the Human Race</i> is the leanest Dodsferd LP to date, packing all that misery into five tracks in thirty minutes, but it still can’t shake off its bloat. Die-hard misanthropists will most likely be able to overlook the tedium and bask in the glory of the gospel of Wrath, but for the rest of us, the album feels uninspired.</p></div>"|19085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19085-dodsferd-the-parasitic-survival-of-the-human-race/|5.8|Zoe Camp

Enter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9345-frankie-cosmos/"">Greta Kline</a>, a 19-year-old who records under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos/"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Cosmos</a>. Her new album, <i>Zentropy</i>, is 10 songs and less than 20 minutes long, opening with a complaint about art school and closing with the eulogy of a pet dog. In between are explorations of love, aging, and the other intricacies of private life, all rendered with the simplicity of a stick-figure drawing. </p>
<p>As its title suggests, <i>Zentropy</i> is a playful but disciplined album. Most of it consists of pretty, tuneful music in a tradition that connects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"">Best Coast</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"">Beat Happening</a> to pared-down takes on 1960s girl-group pop, anchored by a three-piece drum set and an electric guitar—the utility kit of a band that occasionally wants to get loud without ever having to leave the living room. Its longest song is two and a half minutes long, and its best, “Birthday Song”, is just over a minute. “Just because I am a certain age, doesn’t mean that I am any older/ Than I was yesterday,” it starts, Kline’s voice as sweet as a child’s but firm as a board. </p>
<p>Kline is not afraid of cute, self-evident statements like this, nor is she afraid of using them as a bait-and-switch for more complicated ones. “I think how repulsive to you it must be when I refuse to do the things you want me to,” she sings a few seconds later. Like every line on <i>Zentropy</i>, it sounds innocuous when you hear it, but conveys a feeling so rich it could fill a song five times as long. “Repulsive” alone has an almost atomic presence: Pry into it and something unexpectedly big might explode.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the album, Kline confesses, “I do what I/ Have to do/ This is when I say my ‘I love you.’” For a 19-year-old, she has an unusually good grip on the obligations and nuances of long-term relationships, and an ability to relate them in ways that feel clever but direct. “I’m bitter like olives,” she jokes on “Leonie”, but then pivots: “That’s why you like them and I don’t.” Her simplicity is her mask: It makes her seem like she doesn't have anything to say, which is why it’s so surprising when she does.</p>
<p>In the same way rappers exaggerate confidence to give listeners the thrill of feeling strong, Kline—as is custom in our time of ironized over-sharing—exaggerates her sadness to make space for real vulnerability. “I’m the kind of girl buses splash with rain,” she sings. Not just a girl, but a <i>kind</i> of girl: A cliché you’ve seen in movies and heard about in songs. And yet, as soon as she sings it, her sadness feels light and abstract—something playacted. There’s an argument here: The first step to feeling better is to let yourself feel bad; the second is to realize that whatever you’re feeling is probably somewhere on TV right now.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For all its little-girl-lost poses, <i>Zentropy</i> is a tight, confident album. Kline—the daughter of actors Phoebe Cates and Kevin Kline—seems emblematic of the way culture is being re-zineified by shows like ""<a href=""http://www.hbo.com/girls#/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Girls</a>"" or publications like <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rookie</a>: Examples of young female voices who can articulate intimacy in a way that feels savvy and clear. But she also belongs in a larger conversation about older things: the New York poet Frank O’Hara (of whom she is a fan), the sweeter moments of filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, or the sister group the <a href=""http://www.roches.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roches</a>—clever, funny writers who navigated the margins of urban life with heartache and whimsy. What <i>Zentropy</i> reminds me of most is Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2347569/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Frances Ha</i></a>, a movie that did less to capture the sociological particulars of Brooklyn in the 2010s than the archetypal triumphs and disappointments of young life in a big city.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Kline has released over 40 albums and EPs on <a href=""http://ingridsuperstar.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>. Had she wanted to, she could have included 50 songs here, maybe 60. But why muddle the point? She knows what she wants to say and she is saying it. If there are weak moments on the album, it’s when she steps back into a bigger sonic picture: the girl-group chorus on “Dancing in the Public Eye”, the distancing echo of “I Do Too”. Like any music whose strength lies in its intimacy, the fewer reminders <i>Zentropy </i>gives us of the world outside, the better.</p>
<p>Is this music<i> </i>simple? Yes. Solipsistic? That too. But in Kline’s withdrawal, there’s also a kind of humility: Never will she speak for anyone’s experience but her own. “He was just a dog/ Now his body’s gone,” she sings on ""Sad"", the album's last song. “So what is left, but me and my poem?” Nothing, maybe, but that doesn’t matter: The poem is plenty.</p></div>"|19130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19130-frankie-cosmos-zentropy/|8.0|Mike Powell

But lately it’s been an expanding universe, incorporating various musicians into both studio and concert settings; he’s even referred to it as the Sun Araw Band. This ensemble has morphed so much that some iterations took on new names—Turban Chopsticks, <a href=""http://sunaraw.com/duppygun.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Duppy Gun</a>, <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/products/the-celebrate-music-synthesizer-group"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Celebrate Music Synthesizer Group</a>—suggesting Stallones is increasingly interested in subsuming his personality into a larger collective. So, suddenly, it’s surprising that he would make a Sun Araw record by himself.</p>
<p>This would all just be interesting trivia if it didn’t have discernible effects on the music. But the sonic minimalism of <i>Belomancie</i> makes it distinctly the expression of a single mind. This is easily the most sparse, skeletal record Stallones has made. He’s explored stripped-down versions of his woozy psych-dub before, and this double LP is too wide to be labelled with a single style. But the majority has a building-block feel. Frequently throughout its 80 minutes, Stallones hones in on the most irreducible elements of Sun Araw—a single beat here, a minute loop there—to see what might happen if they got to play alone for a while.</p>
<p>The result hypnotizes as strongly as the murkier swirls of previous peaks—the glowing smoke of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14480-on-patrol/"">On Patrol,</a></i> the bleary humidity of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15771-ancient-romans/"">Ancient Romans</a></i>—but in a different way. In a sense, listening to the album’s sharp, pointillist beats and all the air in between them is like staring into space rather blinking into the fog. But there’s also something microscopic about the music that makes it like a nuclear laboratory. With so many layers stripped away—primarily the heavy reverb of Stallones’ guitar, which usually drowns his songs in swampy dreams—what remains gets magnified, meaning a single machine-drum hit can sound as big as a bomb. It’s as if Stallones zoomed so far into the essence of Sun Araw that you can see the molecules circling each other, the neurons firing through synapses. And it’s pretty fun to just keep on staring.</p>
<p>Part of that enjoyment comes from how Stallones can go minimal without losing a key Sun Araw effect—the sense that it’s all happening spontaneously. There may be a path in the crooked beats, squeaking synths, and three-note guitar loops, but there’s certainly no forseeable destination. This open, anything-could-happen vibe comes easier when music is bathed in echo or buried in haze; making sparser stuff feel so pregnant with potential is a trickier feat. But Stallones is so practiced at conjuring that magic that it’s almost impossible to imagine him not doing so. When the pin-pricks and string-slashes of “Scrim”, or the snare punches and two-word lyrics of “Huff” (note those minimal titles) unfurl across their nine-minute journeys, every moment feels like a step toward something new. By the end of each I’m thinking less about how long Stallones has been churning away than about how much longer he clearly could.</p>
<p>Which points to the greater significance of <i>Belomancie</i> in the context of Sun Araw’s oeuvre. It shows Stallones has more moves in his aresnal, more ways he can adjust or reimagine his approach without losing its essence—or in this instance, actually enhancing it. The sounds may be comparatively shrunken, but together they stretch his world, suggesting its expanse may be boundless. If you’ve been fascinated by any of Stallones’ work, <i>Belomancie</i> will get you stoked about not only what he’s done, but how much more he can do.</p></div>"|19107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19107-sun-araw-belomancie/|7.7|Marc Masters

What he plays matters less than what he does before playing it: shoving bits of junk (wood, foil, paper) in the harp or tacks in the hammers. He feeds this snaggletooth grin a diet of frantic minimalist ostinatos and sweetly lingering right-hand themes. Its digestion produces outlandish sounds, not just percussive but also melodic, thanks to live electronic effects. Even when he's playing alone, as he is on <a href=""http://www.cityslang.com/releases/64220/abandoned-city/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Abandoned City</i></a>, we seem to hear everything from kick drums and rattles to synth arpeggios and violas. You'd swear there was a plucked lute on ""Sanzhi Pod City"", a runny music box on ""Pripyat"". I still can't quite believe there aren't strings on ""Who Lived Here?"".</p>
<p>Bertelmann says he was unaware of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTXNxFvjDw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a> when he had the idea, though someone must have clued him in after his first album, as his second was dutifully titled <i>The Prepared Piano</i>. Coming from a techno background, he basically wanted to make an acoustic synthesizer where each key could be programmed, after a fashion, with its own timbre. Quite different from the austerity of Cage, his songs have a clumsy grace, eagerly tripping over themselves as they rush between frolicsome and ominous moods. The latter gain ground on <i>Abandoned City</i>, as though Bertelmann were glimpsing a desolate future in the discarded places for which the songs are named.</p>
<p>After learning his way around solo prepared piano improvisations, Bertelmann started branching out. Enlisting collaborators and adding electronics, he enshrined his knack for pert chamber froth on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12205-ferndorf/""><i>Ferndorf</i></a>, perfected his acoustic house music concept on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15306-salon-des-amateurs/""><i>Salon des Amateurs</i></a>, and tried out bracing modern chamber music with a world-renowned young classical violinist on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16639-silfra/""><i>Silfra</i></a>. <i>Abandoned City</i> brings him full circle to solo piano, but with bits and pieces he's picked up along the way. It's often patterned like electronic dance music, its busy syncopation redoubled by a small fleet of clean and filtered microphones.   </p>
<p>Within its limits, the album is fairly diverse, though after so many records, the style might be wearing a bit thin. There's horror-movie buildup music like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16416-hauschka-elizabeth-bay/"">""Elizabeth Bay""</a>, acoustic IDM like ""Pripyat"", slowly sweeping melancholia like ""Craco"", techno in homespun disguise like the exhilarating ""Agdam"". But no matter what Bertelmann puts in his piano, every clever noise it makes necessarily deprives it of another, expanding timbral range at the expense of harmonic. All the skittering pizzicato, clenched syncopation and scudding bass overshadows distinctions in the compositions. When the convulsions relax on ""Who Lived Here?"", where Bertelmann lets a beautiful melodic structure unfold, it's a nice change of pace to hear more of his voice than his piano's.</p></div>"|19001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19001-hauschka-abandoned-city/|6.5|Brian Howe

Shaggy locks of hair obscured most of their faces, and their skinny arms were clad in flannel and neutral t-shirts. There was nothing outwardly “metal” about their presentation, as long as one ignored the ominous stacks of amplifiers looming behind them on the low chapel stage. They were unassuming, and it was all very unremarkable, until the first note rang out and the rafters shook and the stained glass rattled as Thou proceeded to browbeat the audience with their apocalyptic doom. The band has toured the world and racked up stacks of accolades since then, but you’d never know it from speaking to any of its members.</p>
<p>Within a genre that prides itself on theatricality, Thou’s lack of pretension and their commitment to the DIY world from where they came is refreshing. The band refuses to hide behind elaborate stage shows or tour laminates, releases boatloads of new material every year, and still prefers to pile into their beat-up red van and play all-ages DIY spaces. They hail from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but could seemingly care less about fulfilling anyone else’s “Southern sludge” stereotypes. Basically, Thou have always been Thou, and their stellar new album, <i>Heathen</i> is a portrait of a band that is in complete harmony with itself, if not the world it inhabits. </p>
<p>It’s also their first full-length since 2010’s also stunning <i>Summit</i>, though the band have released a cavalcade of splits, EPs, and covers since then. They’re nothing if not prolific, and luckily, everything they’ve released since their first 2005 demo easily stands up to the most rigorous standards (especially their penchant for recording brutalizing Nirvana covers). This album is no exception. Though <i>Heathen</i> stretches well past the hour mark, the album must be digested as a whole.</p>
<p>The bruising power these songs wield is great and terrible. This fourth full-length is undeniably the band’s most punishing work, and yet is also their most beautiful. Thou explore their melodic potential to an almost startling extent, and devote more than a few moments of the sprawling collection to gentle, uplifting harmonies. The rivers of oppressive sludge are broken up by three short, quiet instrumentals, written around pastoral acoustic guitars that occasionally echo Earth’s dreamy recent output. For the first time, they've allowed a faint glimmer of light to shine through the overbearing gloom.</p>
<p>Not only that, but for the first time, the album also includes clean vocals courtesy of close band ally Emily McWilliams. Her warm, clear tones lighten up the darkness, and add an almost joyful element to <i>Heathen</i>’s shuddering dirges. McWilliams also played puppetmaster for all the strings and horns that pepper the album and add splashes of color to Thou’s usual dark sonic palette.</p>
<p>The album’s first track, “Free Will”, is ominous and somber, building in intensity over the course of nearly 15 minutes and neatly exemplifying what's so compelling about Thou’s trance-inducing chords and tense, ultimately cathartic crescendos. Vocalist Bryan Funck’s near-feral howl commands and chastises, laying out the album’s themes of power, despair, defiance, and free will. His delivery may verge upon black metal in its throat-scraping mania, but the words he speaks are grounded in crushing reality, not fantasy. The demons he confronts are real.</p>
<p>The aforementioned first track, “Into the Marshlands”, and “Immortality Dictates” stand out as album highlights, with the latter sneaking up out of the gloam. In direct contrast to its stark title, the third and longest interlude “Take Off Your Skin and Dance in Your Bones” follows one bright, rippling melody before sinking deep into the mire with the next track’s explosive bait and switch. “Immortality Dictates” underscores McWilliams’ wispy vocals with a ghostly choir, then plunges straight into a caustic dull roar. Other songs like “At the Foot of Mount Driskill” and mournful closer “Ode to Physical Pain” are more inclusive, weaving strains of melody over and under abrasive, fuzz-drenched doom riffs in more traditional Thou style.</p>
<p>They may have lightened up a bit, but Thou have definitely not lost their ability to shock and awe. Those who appreciate the electric frisson of the band’s lumbering doom riffs and Funck’s acerbic snarl will find much to appreciate here, and it’s hard to see even a casual listener taking issue with the more experimental bent of the LP, especially when it works so well. Consumed by struggle and steeped in agony, <i></i>Thou have truly reached a summit.</p></div>"|18962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18962-thou-heathen/|8.4|Kim Kelly

He's occasionally experimented with sounds from other genres—electro's searing synth lines, beachy balearic tempos, expansive space disco—but he's always returned to house's straightforward pulse, both with his original productions and as a DJ. Reliability has been Niemerski's calling card but his best material comes when he steps out of his comfort zone. He had a minor blog-crossover hit with 2010's Soul II Soul-jacking remix of defunct Toronto house ragamuffins <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29053-azari-iii/"" target=""_blank"">Azari &amp; III</a>'s ""Reckless With Your Love"". That year also brought ""Coma Cat"", a classic slice of 1980s-redolent house music on blissed-out dance hub Permanent Vacation that paired textural intensity with a melody that was a serious earworm.</p>
<p>It's been nearly four years since ""Coma Cat"" and Niemerski has remained reliable, so <i>Glow</i> seeks to both capitalize on that rep and introduce him to a larger audience—it's not only is it his debut album, it's also his first time on a major. Successful dance full-lengths generally take one of two approaches: a statement of purpose separate from the creator’s established style or a collection of existing singles, rounded up as a primer for newcomers. <i>Glow</i> goes in a different direction, offering a streamlined, sanitized version of the Tensnake sound. It's house music in miniature form, heavily brushed with disco's steady-handed bounce and tempered with just enough potential pop-crossover appeal. Niemerski generally works best with room to stretch, as his best productions typically land around the seven-minute mark. A brief glance at the running time of <i>Glow</i>'s individual songs—only one pushes the six-minute mark, while most clock in at three-and-a-half—suggests that he compromised his vision to accommodate a larger stage.</p>
<p>Much of the album finds Niemerski collaborating with Berlin vocalist Fiora, a capable singer whose unshowy qualities makes her both malleable and forgettable; save for ""See Right Through"", a moody cut that's made the rounds over the past year, Fiora's presence feels more like a placeholder, a paperweight meant to anchor the barely-sketched house figures. Niemerski's collaborations with other artists fare worse; the stale ""Pressure"", a disco workout featuring vocalist Thabo, never capitalizes on its propulsive build, while ""Feel of Love"", a team-up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2475-jamie-lidell/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Lidell</a> and space cadet Stuart Price in his Jacques Lu Cont alias, is a jagged, off-putting synth-pop tune that resembles the many low points of Lidell's self-titled LP from last year.</p>
<p>Many of <i>Glow</i>'s songs are just-<i>there</i>, but a few manage to be engaging: ""No Relief"", ""See Right Through"", and ""No Colour"" are perfect examples of Niemerski's still-considerable talent with house form. The latter two tunes made memorable appearances on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/tensnake/essentialmix-tensnake"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Essential Mix</a>, confirming that he's most in his zone when dreaming of the dancefloor. The appropriately slow ""58 BPM"" is a lush, swarming synth-pop tune that serves as the album's strongest vocal cut, while album bookends ""First Song"" and ""Last Song"" play around with pop-focused drone while embracing the type of epic beams found in M83's music (or, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"" target=""_blank""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>' own jet-engine closer, ""Horizon"").</p>
<p>Both ""First Song"" and ""Last Song"" suggest that Niemerski may have had a more focused album experience in mind, but it never had a chance given the record's scattershot approach. Given its release on a high-profile label, as well as recent shifts in mainstream dance culture, it's possible to look at <i>Glow</i> more cynically. Michaelangelo Matos <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/edm-record-labels-sell-dance-music/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently described</a> Niemerski's Astralwerks signing as the latest example of the EDM cash-grab still raging on in North America. But the album is so slight, it’ll be easy to forget it exists and hope that Tensnake's next full-length won't sound so uninspired.</p></div>"|19000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19000-tensnake-glow/|5.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

Three years later, Mount dusted off some old vintage navy blazer and got yacht-rockish for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15337-the-english-riviera/"" target=""_blank""><i>The English Riviera</i></a>, trading California beaches for the boardwalks of English seaside resorts and almost pulling off the integration.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With another three years passed, Metronomy arrives with another rearview glance at pop and rock history, aging backwards into a gray space between late psych and early glam with a bit of pastoral Kinks ennui mixed in to whatever's left of the old indie-dance pedigree. (He even booked Toe Rag Studios for that special analog-purist touch.) But there's a wide gulf between the idea of <i>Love Letters</i> as pleasant, throwbackish pop-rock nugget and the vapor-thin nonentity it became. What worked for <i>The English Riviera</i>'s mellow beachfront reveries—subdued instrumentation, placid vocals, clinical studio-band polish—doesn't stick as well when the tempo's edged back up a notch or two towards something a bit more trad-rock. And what simple-enough songwriting chops there are to this album's credit are delivered so flimsily it's less twee than just plain weak.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you're looking for a specific culprit, pin that on Mount's voice. Ten seconds and twelve words into opener ""The Upsetter"", Mount tries pushing his luck at the end of the phrase ""straight from the satellite"" and creaks out this whimpery Bowie affectation that's a pained balloon-squeak of a noise. It's viscerally grating, and there's more where that came from: When he's not reducing his passionless mumbling to a caricature of a non-committal indie-slacker voice (at its slackest on lite-Kraut ""Call Me"" and the dozy quasi-waltz ""Never Wanted""), he's trying his hand at a fume-drunk midpoint between 60s UK pop and velvety R&amp;B that creaks and shudders under the burden of a voice better built for flatness. Even through a number of permutations—Holiday Inn lounge Motown (""I'm Aquarius""), chirpy analog-organ dance-craze pop (""Reservoir""), drunk-dial <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/777-the-clientele/"" target=""_blank"">Clientele</a> (""The Most Immaculate Haircut"")—it sounds like he's holding back, looking at his feet, trying not to cause a scene.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The big shame is that all these side-route trips into oddball drum-machine garage rock or motorik-a-go-go soul had the making of something daringly weird, intentionally out of step with your typical Brit-indie fare, yet still giddily catchy. After three NyQuilcore tracks that make the drum machine from Timmy Thomas' ""Why Can't We Live Together"" sound like a Clyde Stubblefield/Ginger Baker showdown, the title track feints towards another woozy slog for a bit over a minute before breaking out in a big stomping piano-pounding number that actually shakes the needle. If only the rest of the record caught on to that out-front force—the words on <i>Love Letters</i> might scan as more than lonely fridge-magnet poetry, the beats might feel like more than just placeholders, and the music could be something to dance to instead of just drift off to.</p></div>"|19101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19101-metronomy-love-letters/|5.2|Nate Patrin

Clean-cut vocalist George Mitchell, who keeps his eyes closed when he sings, clearly likes Ian Curtis, but his pained yelp is more reminiscent of onetime Baltimore standouts Wilderness or a cleaner Iceage with a hint of Joe Strummer's rock'n'roll swagger. All that, and he and the band can really write hooks.</p>
<p>On their self-titled debut, the bass and guitar parts can easily pull you in when Mitchell's death-pop cadences don't. The album's best track, ""Possessed"", would stand out on just about any post-punk mix tape, and would rule over <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18856-killed-by-deathrock-vol-1/"" target=""_blank"">Killed by Deathrock</a></i>. It's coiled, explosive, and sharp, the kind of song you can imagine inspiring a drunken sing-along 10 years down the road. Elsewhere, the fuzzed-up, swaggering ""Tough Luck"" is worthy of Glenn Danzig and co. in their prime, and ""Opaque"" swirls together vintage shoegaze noise with fist-pumping melodies. Then there's the five-minute closer, ""Soulless Youth"", a song that comes off like a very amped-up PiL with a howling psychedelic comedown. These guys know how to flesh out a track with enveloping noise and feedback.</p>
<p>That said, Eagulls' music has so far been overshadowed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9300-eagulls/"" target=""_blank"">a letter they posted online</a> after last year's SXSW, a letter that is still, to a degree, defining the band. In the screed, they talked about ""beach bands sucking each others’ dicks and rubbing the press’ clit"" and made some comments about ""90s hairstyles,"" people who dress like Disney characters, ""disgusting Afro Beat sounds,"" and groups that only get attention because they feature girls. The note wasn't as compelling, or as offensive, as people wanted it to be, and the fact that they took it down, replacing it with <a href=""http://eagulls.blogspot.com/2013/01/blog-post_3005.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an image of a naked ass and ball sack</a>, suggested that it was all a sophomoric prank.</p>
<p>Still, the letter, and the way they've distanced themselves from it, points to a conundrum for Eagulls: When your backstory is less interesting than your music, you don't want that backstory clouding the narrative around you. And that's what's happened here. To put it plainly, Eagulls are a harmless, talented group—this is not the stuff of GG Allin, or the Sex Pistols (or even Jesus Lizard). Read the interviews: nice guys who talk about having shitty jobs and feeling depressed. Basic stuff. You can't make out all of the lyrics, but when you hear Mitchell sing about ""soulless youth,"" ""hollow visions,"" and being nervous and tired, you won't mistake his material or story for Richard Hell's <i>Blank Generation</i>. These songs cover heroin addicts and sexual assault, and other darker, complicated subjects, but it doesn't <i>feel</i> dark, and it really isn't.</p>
<p>And this isn't a problem. Eagulls have synthesized their influences well, and have created an enjoyable rock record (they've been around since 2010, which may account for why so many of these songs sounds accomplished as they do); so while <i>Eagulls</i> is not exactly life-changing music, the songs stick with you, and sometimes that's enough. </p></div>"|18987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18987-eagulls-eagulls/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

In the last several years Shuford has reclaimed his Georgia roots by inhabiting the alter ego of D. Charles Speer, frontman of a band he calls the Helix. As No-Neck has grown quieter the past few years, the Speer persona seems to be growing in its creative influence on Shuford. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5794-d-charles-speer-and-the-helix/"">D. Charles Speer and the Helix</a> were relegated to side-project status in the past, NNCK is now in Speer’s shadow.   <br/><br/>D. Charles Speer and the Helix has always felt like Shuford’s way of giving his home state its due. His southern drawl is Georgia-specific, bringing to mind a younger, more-prone-to-slurring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13197-larry-jon-wilson/"">Larry Jon Wilson</a>. No-Neck and the jammy psych of Rhyton (another Shuford side project with ex-Psychic Ills member Jimy Seitang) are boundless, but the Helix is far more contained. That’s not to say the music of D. Charles Speer has ever been particularly easy to pin down or pigeonhole. Speer’s deep drawl and bandmate Marc Orleans’ weepy pedal steel give it an unmistakably Southern feel, but calling it country-rock or Americana or anything like that would be woefully reductive. Outlaw country is closer, but that underplays the psychedelia.  <br/><br/>The thematic material on new album <i>Doubled Exposure</i> is similarly restless. “Is this exoskeleton your true identity?/ Eat some boric acid, prove your love to me,” goes some of the barely discernible lyrics from leadoff track “Wallwalker"", a Kafka-esque insect allegory set to a boogie beat. There’s “fabled bestiality” between a queen and a bull on “Cretan Lords"", which sounds like Dick Dale sitting in with the house band at a Cretian bar (the bouzouki and baglamas recall Speer’s Mediterranean solo diversion <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15444-arghiledes-leaving-the-commonwealth/""><i>Arghiledes</i></a>). Speer casually sidesteps from the exotic to more traditional story songs like “Bootlegging Blues"", which begins appropriately with a popped bottle and a gluggy pour as Speer woozily sings about corn whiskey like a man who’s been leaning against the saloon piano and hitting the bottle himself between takes. “Red Clay Road” is unmistakably Georgian, with mentions of bacon fat, mustard greens and a Ford coupe gunning down Highway 9 “from Dawsonville to the ATL.”<br/><br/>The instrumental “Mandorla at Dawn” is <i>Doubled Exposure</i>’s outlier, starting with an unassuming, minor-key ascending guitar riff that bleeds into a 70s country-rock, pedal-steel hook, almost like a wordless Derek &amp; the Dominos outtake. But after three minutes, things start getting weird—courtesy of some live looping and staccato piano vamping. They get progressively weirder and No-Necky until the song ends close to the 10-minute mark. You could argue it’s out of place on an album of mostly structured songs, but I think it works the same way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"" target=""_blank"">Yo La Tengo</a>’s lengthy jams tend to open up albums of otherwise structured songs. It’s a dose of excitement and a good reminder of the far-out capabilities of these players. <br/><br/><i>Doubled Exposure</i> is a fun, chewy listen as it spins, but there’s also nothing too sticky about it. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"">David Berman</a>, Speer’s oddball vocal delivery offers surprises that keep things engaging, but Speer doesn’t have the same larger-than-life presence on this album that he has onstage (especially in a bar with low ceilings). The record ends on a sour note, too. “Tough Soup” feels like a throwaway with its boilerplate blues-rock solo and lyrics that OD on cheeky drug references (“This recipe stands alone/ it guarantees a consistency of stone”; “cook it on high”). But the album is also further proof that D. Charles Speer and the Helix is a more-than-worthy NNCK diversion and a testament to the band’s ability to stretch out within a framework. D. Charles Speer is unmistakably Dave Charles Shuford, and that’s a good thing.</p></div>"|19073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19073-d-charles-speer-and-the-helix-doubled-exposure/|6.6|Joel Oliphint

They were the guys with obsessive record collections and an extensive knowledge of zine culture, dudes with the wherewithal to run their own mail order tape labels and put on all-ages shows in shitty makeshift venues while still finding time to pursue mostly unusable degrees. Maybe they also sold you weed. Ben Asbury definitely seems like one of those dudes. </p>
<p class=""p3"">For a few years now, Asbury has been working as Axxa/Abraxas, turning out charmingly messy psych-pop and releasing it into the world via his own label, RTA Arts Collective. Given the wily nature of his music and his visual art (he is also an accomplished silkscreen artist), the label’s official motto—""Archetypal artwork in reflection of the Cosmic Harmony""—makes perfect sense. On <i>Axxa/Abraxas, </i>Asbury’s first official full-length on Captured Tracks, the songwriter takes a lifetime love of outré psych-pop and squeezes it into occasionally overstuffed but generally affable songs about night rides and mystical winds. </p>
<p class=""p3"">For someone whose earlier work could often be so gloriously messy, the 10 tracks on <i>Axxa/Abraxas</i> are surprisingly straightforward. “I Almost Fell” aims for an Apples in Stereo-like pop and is the record’s catchiest track, and “Ryan Michalak (Is Coming to Town)” has the kind of Crystal Stilts swagger that sounds excellent blasting loudly out of a pair of vintage speakers. Still, Asbury’s lyrics, when considered outside of their trippy environs, can be rough. Only someone with his powerful wail can get away with the likes of  “Close your eyes so your mind can see/ Try to find what’s your destiny/ Nothings free” and make it sound both convincingly metaphysical and absolutely sincere. </p>
<p class=""p3"">Given Asbury’s claim to have discovered punk rock in the Third Grade, it makes sense that his music feels so intentionally kaleidoscopic. Influences like Television Personalities, Grateful Dead, and Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse (with an emphasis on the Crazy Horse) are heard throughout. The most obvious precursors appear to be local. Given that he is a Georgia native, and that most of <i>Axxa/Abraxas</i> was written during his time as a student in Athens, one can’t help but hear the ghostly echoes of the prodigious Elephant 6 Recording Company, particularly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30619-the-olivia-tremor-control/"" target=""_blank"">the Olivia Tremor Control</a>.  </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Axxa/Abraxas</i> was mixed and engineered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a> member Jarvis Taveniere, and much of it sounds like it could actually be a Woods record. It's a charming album from an artist with an obsessive/compulsive love for writing shambolic, vaguely psych-infused rock songs but it doesn’t distinguish itself from any number of similar records from this sphere over the past few years. Asbury’s personality and his charismatic voice save it from being completely generic, and one hopes they'll carry him into weirder landscapes on future releases. </p></div>"|19091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19091-axxaabraxas-axxaabraxas/|6.7|T.

In 2006, the Florida progressive metal paragons returned to the stage after a decade away from both recording and performing (plus a short stint under another name). The first phase of Cynic’s existence had been short but crucial; in only five years, they evolved from an atavistic thrash band to a frame-breaking alloy of technical death metal and thundering jazz fusion, crystallized on their wonderfully vexing 1993 debut, <i>Focus</i>. Two decades later, <i>Focus </i>still sounds like future music, <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/hall-of-fame/cynic/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an impossibly complex rush of disparate parts and unseen twists</a> that maintains its momentum in spite of its bewildering mechanics. It’s righteous and affirming, too, and not just for its instrumental heroics; with his voice floating in a web of electronics and his head in a cloud of self-made mysticism, Paul Masvidal extolled the infinity of the mind and the sovereignty of the individual.</p>
<p>Their post-reunion LP, 2008’s <i>Traced in Air</i>, thrived on a similarly ambitious mix of power and prowess, though the aging members Cynic had tempered the ambitious parts. The metal, jazz, and math seemed partly pulled apart, strands that no longer held one another so closely. It was a worthy successor and proof that their legacy could live beyond one 15-year-old benchmark. It was also a chance for graceful closure. Instead, Cynic have made <i>Kindly Bent to Free Us</i>, a debacle that scraps not only that exit opportunity but also a chunk of what made them interesting at all.</p>
<p>As if to prevent the perception that they, after a quarter century, simply became just another band aiming to issue a new record every several years, Cynic drastically shift their approach for <i>Kindly Bent to Free Us</i>. In fact, on album three, they leave approximately half of their sound behind. Though <i>Kindly Bent to Free Us</i> does get dense and loud, with the occasional viscous march and tempestuous drum burst, they slough off much of their metal persona for eight tepid tracks. These pieces bend toward post-rock (mawkish closer “Endlessly Bountiful”) and prog (the swiveling “Moon Heart Sun Head”). Brighter production and fewer moving parts dovetail to give Masvidal’s computerized vocals a broader spotlight, too. At their best, that choice offers a pop-like gleam. At worst, it shapes the songs into the unintentional comedy album of the year. <a href=""http://changeoffaces.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/snap-today.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lyrics lifted from the cereal Rice Krispies</a> float above ceremoniously solemn guitars. The plea “Oh mercy, radiate your grace on me” lingers as the grand, laughable conclusion of a particularly knotty span. And that’s just before Masvidal, singing with a choir composed only of himself, informs us repeatedly that “There will be holy fallout.” His tone is clear, clean, and garish. Without the <i>frisson</i> afforded by their more aggressive portion, Cynic’s music becomes a string of unfortified punchlines.</p>
<p>The mere deletion of Cynic’s metal side isn’t itself a satisfactory condition for the failure of <i>Kindly Bent to Free Us</i>; some of these hooks are among the most radiant moments in the band’s catalogue, and some of the instrumental interplay ranks among their most fascinating. It’s not pedestrian, either. These guitar solos remain knots of notes that seem to start and stop time. Cynic also relishes in the daunting task of dividing melodies across every instrument, as they do at the start of the interesting “Gitanjali.”</p>
<p>But the omitted ingredients make Cynic too predictable—not only for the rote order in which things happen here but also for the things that never have the chance to happen. <i>Focus</i> might be impossibly complex, but at least on a structural level, these new songs seem flatly simple, as though the trio plugged parts into an algorithm and played to the resulting script. They favor short, vaguely threatening intros followed by full-band bursts, as that’s how three of the first four songs begin. By the time opener “True Hallucination Speak” reaches its second chorus, its routine movement between quiet and loud, full tempo and no tempo has already become a bore. “Moon Heart Sun Head” seesaws between marching, drum-led verses and lulling, bass-heavy impasses. Even a hyperkinetic solo and a lengthy sample of philosopher Alan Watts reading from his <i>The Nature of Consciousness </i>can’t excite that back and forth. If you get the feeling that you know what’s coming next while listening to <i>Kindly Bent to Free Us</i>, your premonition is most likely correct. In losing a chunk of their identity, Cynic also lost their ability to do the entirely unexpected. They once launched the listener into a sense of wonder and kept them there for minutes on end. Not here.</p>
<p>In the past several years, the bands of peoples’ dreams have reunited. Some have cashed in with high-profile gigs but (at least to date) <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/neutral-milk-hotel-reunion-show-tour-baltimore-ragged-glorious/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recorded little else</a>, while others have dazzled with <a href=""http://gorguts.bandcamp.com/album/colored-sands"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new material</a> that made you mourn their initial hiatus once again. Still others have embarrassed themselves with endless cash grabs and <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/14282-pixies-ep2-ep-review"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new recordings that amounted to debacles</a>, and a few have made new material that sounds <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10127-beyond/"" target=""_blank"">more or less</a> like what they left behind. Cynic is a most peculiar case, though: They got back together to play the old stuff and ended up <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2008/10/30/cynics-paul-masvidal-the-metalsucks-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">enjoying the experience</a> so much that they wrote a copacetic follow-up to the only album they’d ever made. And now, after the reunion buzz has had time to dissipate, they’ve embarrassed themselves with a record that fails because it divides their legacy in half. <i>Kindly Bent to Free Us</i> works as a sort of retroactive insult: It resurrects many of the misgivings people have always had about Cynic—the overindulgent vocals, for instance, or the ponderous new-age musings—and runs wild with them. In fact, when I listened back to <i>Focus</i> after hearing <i>Kindly Bent to Free Us</i>, those traits felt like strangely fresh faults, where they’d once been part of Cynic’s unlikely <i>sui generis</i> appeal. It’s a shame that the present now haunts this band’s peerless past.</p></div>"|18859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18859-cynic-kindly-bent-to-free-us/|4.0|Grayson Haver Currin

A lush, airy slice of R&amp;B, ""Frontin'"" existed as a pleasurable curio until three years later, when Pharrell released his first full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9238-in-my-mind/"" target=""_blank""><i>In My Mind</i></a>.</p>
<p><i>In My Mind</i> was a low-key record that favored cascading piano cadences and psychedelic soul touches as a backdrop for Pharrell's vacuous lyrics, and it sounds a little better in 2014 than its reputation suggests. But at the time, it cratered both commercially and critically, and Pharrell's solo career faded in tandem with the Neptunes' own slow retreat from the spotlight. The fact that he continued to make music as part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"" target=""_blank"">N.E.R.D</a>., his genre-melding, notoriously inconsistent project with Neptunes partner Chad Hugo, suggested that the chilly reception accompanied by striking out on his own was a blow to his self-confidence. ""I wrote those songs out of ego,"" he told <a href=""http://www.gq.com/entertainment/profiles/201402/pharrell-girl-album-exclusive"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>GQ</i></a> in an interview earlier this year. ""What was good about that? There was no purpose.""</p>
<p>If the materialistic bent of <i>In My Mind</i> was indicative of where Pharrell was in 2006, then <i>G I R L</i>, his second solo album, points to what he's looking to achieve in 2014. The last eight years of the 40-going-on-23 years old auteur's career have been light on creative substance—there were a few key contributions to albums from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"" target=""_blank"">Ushe</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"" target=""_blank"">r</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, as well as heavy involvement in the score for the 2010 animated film <i>Despicable Me</i>. But the success of Robin Thicke's ""Blurred Lines"", along with Pharrell's work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"" target=""_blank"">Random Access Memories</a></i>, propelled him into a new level of ubiquity. In a recent Pitchfork interview, Pharrell <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9343-pharrell/"">explained</a> that the idea for the album came from Columbia after they first heard the still-inescapable ""Get Lucky"" and saw dollar signs. ""They offered me a deal on the spot,"" he said. ""If I was left to my own devices, I would not have elected to do it.""</p>
<p>On <i>Random Access Memories</i>, Daft Punk created an expensive-sounding and grandiose monument to the music that shaped their personal histories; on <i>G I R L</i>, Pharrell has done something similar, but with a significantly narrower scope. A bright, smooth demonstration of musical largesse that features a diverse cast of supporting players including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Timberlake</a>, Daft Punk, composer Hans Zimmer, Kelly Osborne, and teen breakout-turned-internet R&amp;B curiosity JoJo, <i>G I R L</i> calls back to sounds that have shaped its creator's musical vision. There's the nervous sexuality of peak-era Michael Jackson, bright-eyed 1970s soul, funk's squishy right-angle riffs. But largely, <i>G I R L</i> finds Pharrell taking inspiration from Pharrell. His past successes, both solo and as part of the Neptunes, echo throughout the album: the sweaty slink of Timberlake's ""Rock Your Body"", N.E.R.D.'s yacht-rock fixations on 2002's so-nice-they-recorded-it-twice <i>In Search Of…</i>, the gum-snapping percussion on Snoop Dogg's ""Drop It Like It's Hot"", the lad's-mag R&amp;B of ""Blurred Lines"", and the undying jangle of ""Get Lucky"". </p>
<p>The appeal of Pharrell's production has long been a push-and-pull between elegance and agitation. He's capable of sounds that can <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjWAWcx4xdE&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blow your eardrums</a> <i>and</i> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCIo0EMt8G0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gently caress them into submission</a>. <i>G I R L</i> also tempers its classic-pop approach with strident sonics, as sharp edges poke through the record's overall smoothness—the airless riffs of ""Hunter"", ""Come Get It Bae""'s cascading claps, the ascendant horn figure that punctures ""Brand New""'s chorus. These are small hints that Pharrell has a knack for pop music that, at its core, sounds a little weird. But <i>G I R L</i> hedges its bets; its all-ages, aisle-reaching attitude is ready for mass consumption, and over the next year and maybe longer, you'll probably be hearing these easy-to-please tunes anywhere you can find a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">room without a roof</a>.</p>
<p>""Happy"", originally conceived for the soundtrack to last year's <i>Despicable Me 2,</i> has already reached the point of mass saturation and currently sits atop the Billboard Hot 100. Accompanied by a celebrity-packed video that's impossible to watch without a grin on your face (as well as a 24-hour version that's impossible to watch without a nap and a few square meals), the walking-on-air retro-soul of ""Happy"" is, arguably, one of the most beatific and lovable pop singles in recent memory, a bundle of New Age koans dipped in honey and left out to dry on a breezy spring day. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/"" target=""_blank"">Cee-Lo</a>'s ""Fuck You"" was a declarative T-shirt of a single, ""Happy"" is what you'd get if you turned that T-shirt inside-out, its effortless <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls_8cFgBUj4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">just-keep-livin'</a> attitude reflected in its presentation.</p>
<p>In addition to being <i>G I R L</i>'s highlight, ""Happy"" also stands apart from the thinly-drawn concept spelled out in the album's title. ""Women and girls, for the most part, “have just been so loyal to me and supported me,"" he told <i>GQ</i> when speaking to the album's thematic concerns, unintentionally reflecting <i>G I R L</i>'s shallow non-attempt at paying tribute to the opposite sex. Save for the hang-in-there-baby Alicia Keys duet ""Know Who You Are"", nearly every woman on <i>G I R L</i> is the object of sexual pursuit, with Pharrell reprising the horny-schoolboy routine he, Thicke, and T.I. embodied in the ""Blurred Lines"" video.</p>
<p>In a recent London listening session, Pharrell <a href=""http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/we-heard-pharrells-new-album-this-is-what-it-sounds-like?recache=1&amp;t=1231314"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hinted</a> that <i>G I R L</i>'s female-centric focus was an attempt to rectify his association with the ""questionable lyrics"" that provoked accusations of sexism in ""Blurred Lines"". It misses the mark badly. On ""Hunter"", over a jarringly limp funk motif, Pharrell ditches his Dudley Do-Right hat for something more sinister, comparing the objects of his affection to animal carcasses stuffed for sport and shoehorning in an awkward (and ill-timed) ""Duck Dynasty"" reference before laying it out in no unspecific terms: ""I'm a hunter.""</p>
<p>The tone-deaf ""Hunter"" also happens to be <i>G I R L</i>'s boldest moment. Other bits stand out—the come-hither hedonism of the Miley Cyrus-featuring ""Come Get It Bae"" and the bushy-tailed ebullience that Timberlake brings to ""Brand New"", especially—but Pharrell leans a bit too hard on his <a href=""http://theboombox.com/pharrell-wins-2014-grammy-award-producer-of-the-year/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grammy-winning</a> formula of tasteful, everything-in-its-right-place retro-pop. ""Gust of Wind"", featuring Daft Punk, has all the relentless stair-climbing of <i>Random Access Memories</i>' ""Lose Yourself to Dance"" with none of that song's patient build; it jogs in place for five minutes that feel much longer. No one will deny Pharrell's place in shaping how pop music's sounded in the past 15 years, and the lack of innovation found on <i>G I R L</i> is also inarguable.</p>
<p>So while the immaculately blended pop smoothie that is <i>G I R L</i> goes down easy, its complacency is disappointing. Which makes ""Lost Queen"", the eight-minute stretcher placed on the record's back half, so surprising. Over hand drums and sampled chants, Pharrell unspools the type of corny pick-up lines and awkward pop-culture references (""Like Geico/ The time I'll save you/ Can get those motors runnin'"") that <i>G I R L</i> is lousy with; then, the structure dissolves midway through, washed away by the sound of crashing waves, orchestral stabs, and refreshing sighs, reminiscent of Timberlake's <i>The 20/20 Experience</i> ballad ""Spaceship Coupe"". ""You gotta go inward/ To experience the outer space that was built for you,"" Pharrell sings in a watery cadence, offering advice that, at <i>G I R L</i>'s endpoint, you wish he took closer to heart.</p></div>"|19100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19100-pharrell-g-i-r-l/|6.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Case in point: five years ago, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30799-m/"" target=""_blank"">Karen Marie Ørsted</a> was writing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3271-peaches/"" target=""_blank"">Peaches</a>-aping novelty songs titled ""When I Saw His Cock"", which included raps as trashy as her beats. Fast forward half of a decade, and the only thing the music of the Copenhagen native, now 25, shares with her earliest demos is an omnivorous musical appetite, one that synthesizes a number of of-the-moment sounds on her self-assured debut as MØ, <i>No Mythologies to Follow</i>.</p>
<p>The album finds MØ (pronounced somewhere between ""Muh"" and the sound a cow makes) ditching shock-rap for more mature but no less immediate electro-pop that explores the swirling confusion of young adulthood. Its sound is one that's equally as indebted to the forward-thinking Scandinavian pop scene she comes from as it is to the sounds of Southern rap and modern bass music. It's the kind of output you'd expect from an artist who's grown up with instant, unlimited access to music from every corner of the globe. This melting-pot approach pervades<i> No Mythologies to Follow</i>, which was produced almost entirely by Ronni Vindahl, a fellow Dane who makes up one-half of <a href=""http://nowav.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Wav.</a>, the production team that includes Robin Hannibal, aka the dude responsible for the sensuous, restrained arrangements found on last year's debut from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"" target=""_blank"">Rhye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17693-rhye-woman/"" target=""_blank""><i>Woman</i></a>.</p>
<p>MØ and Vindahl are a good pairing, sharing an easy chemistry as collaborators; Vindahl's production keeps up with but never eclipses MØ, and she doesn't bat an eyelash at his production, which has some bite. Most of the album's twelve tracks are built on top of a sturdy bedrock of tick-tick-ticking 808s and swarms of pulsing synths; ""Maiden"" and ""Red in the Grey"" get the throb of post-dubstep right, and glockenspiels and horns play nice with molasses-thick claps and a gurgling bassline on ""Pilgrim"". There's often a lot happening on these tracks, and this is only compounded by the fact MØ loves her multi-tracked vocals and ad-libs. It has the effect of turning her into a one-woman girl group—the massive lurch of ""Fire Rides"", for instance, leaves plenty of space for MØ to harmonize with herself, and she stuffs the track to the brim with ecstatic shouts and fists-in-the-air woops.</p>
<p>At this point you're probably getting the impression that <i>No Mythologies to Follow</i> isn't exactly a study in minimalism; combined with her everything-is-a-hook style of songwriting, MØ ends up building a rather outsized persona for herself over the course of the album. It's never of the one-note all-caps variety, but it sometimes obscures nuanced performances and her ability to simultaneously nail a bunch of conflicting emotions, often within the span of a single line. ""I never want to know the name of your new girlfriend"" she wails on ""Never Wanna Know"", both because she's not sure she can handle the piece of information but also because she recognizes that knowing gives her another reason to obsess over her ex rather than move forward and on.</p>
<p>At the heart of everything is MØ's voice, a powerful and versatile tool comfortable expressing emotional turmoil as it is wearing a fuck-the-haters scowl. You can almost see her stretching on the tips of her toes as she soars into the clouds during the chorus of the aforementioned ""Never Wanna Know"", and she plays a convincing house diva on ""Slow Love"", a Balearic slinker that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"" target=""_blank"">John Talabot</a> at his loosest. And although it makes no apologies for the bits and pieces it takes from her contemporaries, <i>No Mythologies to Follow</i> doesn't work because it assembles the right ingredients in the right amount—it works because a likable persona is something you just can't teach.</p></div>"|19050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19050-m-no-mythologies-to-follow/|7.1|Renato Pagnani

That album, 1970’s <i>Parallelograms</i>, has persisted over decades, even as Perhacs herself moved on with her life after the record failed and copies of it slowly disappeared from print. The people who heard it, though, did not move on. They made their own editions and passed the album to those they deemed worthy. One of those people was the leader of the prog-metal band Opeth, who did as much as anyone to keep copies of Parallelograms circulating. A legend built. Eventually, someone notified Perhacs.</p>
<p>It’s the kind of tidy capsule story that makes for an excellent set of liner notes, but it’s worth stepping back and reassessing the phenomenal unlikeliness of the tale now that we’re faced with its follow-up,<i> The Soul of All Natural Things</i>. The gulf separating 1970 from now might be dizzying for some, but Perhacs' sense of time is looser than ours, and it doesn’t seem to phase her.</p>
<p><i>The Soul Of All Natural Things</i> was made with several of Perhacs' contemporary admirers helping her; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a> appears on ""Prisms of Glass"", and Ramona Gonzalez contributes backing vocals. The resulting album has a fluid, communal energy to it that feels very different from <i>Parallelograms</i>. Perhacs' voice is duskier at 70 than it was at 27, but her range is still surprising, dipping into sultry contralto and leaping easily into higher registers. Her ear for multi-tracked harmonies remains the clearest link back to her first album, and you can hear her quizzical and highly original musical mind operating through them. It's easy to find in them the sound that bewitched latter-day followers like Holter.</p>
<p>What <i>The Soul Of All Natural Things</i> isn't, though, is personal, or small-scale, the way <i>Parallelograms</i> was. Perhacs’ first words on <i>Parallelograms</i> were “And it rains here every day since I came”—a conversational line, right down to the way it begins with “And.” That song followed a series of abstracted thoughts like raindrops across a window pane—""It kinda gets inside you...the silences, I mean. They kinda wrap around you and loosen everything."" The first words on the opening title track of <i>The Soul of All Natural Things</i>, meanwhile, are “See the waves that break upon the rocks and stones/ Hear the winds that play upon the ice and foam.” Same focus—the weather, the elements—but the smallness of the human mind has been subtracted. There is no chit-chat to be had here.</p>
<p>In other words, <i>The Soul Of All Natural Things</i> is more purely new age than Perhacs' first record. God as a force, as a character, suffuses these songs, whispering to wind and waves on the title track and carrying the world's ""river of souls"" on ""River of God"". ""Immunity"" is a plea to God to help listen for his love. There is no dogma, just a gentle insistence on slowing down. “Where are you going and if you are going can you take some time for me, just today?"" she inquires on ""Children"". The music is gorgeously recorded, with strings and nylon-string guitar filitering through the mix like the sunlight through the trees in her Topanga Canyon home. But where <i>Parallelograms</i> basked in some cosmic energies, it also offered you a series of conflicting thoughts to puzzle over. <i>The Soul of All Natural Things</i> mostly pats you on the head a little and tell you to calm down.</p>
<p>The best moments are when the song forms fracture a little, and Perhacs' multi-tracked voice is allowed to spiral free. “Prisms of Glass” and “Freely”, two songs in the middle of the record, capture more genuine spiritual feeling with the haunting sound of Perhacs’ interlocking vocals than anything else on the album. On “Song of the Planets”, her voice blurs into a repetition of the words “one” and “sun,” creating the blissful synthesis that the lyrics can only point to.<i> The Soul of All Natural Things</i> is sumptuously recorded and often beautiful, and honestly, it’s wonderful to have it. If it's difficult to envision a 44-year cult of devotion arising from its songs, well, once in this lifetime is probably enough for that kind of achievement.</p></div>"|19066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19066-linda-perhacs-the-soul-of-all-natural-things/|6.8|Jayson Greene

Safely ensconced in something called the Magic Twig Community—a cache of like-minded musicians living in the mountains of Roanoke, Virginia—the band’s first recorded efforts were a mixture jingle-jangle guitars and lo-fi minimalism. On their 2011 debut,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14962-silver/"" target=""_blank""><i> Silver</i></a>, Guitarist and vocalist Nicole Yun and drummer Daniel Cundiff tossed off anti-authority missives and swoony romantic paeans in equal measure, managing to wring a surprising amount dynamic tension from a simple guitar and drums setup. On 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16772-correct-behavior/"" target=""_blank""><i>Correct Behavior</i></a>, the inclusion of a new band member—bassist Jonathan Woods—helped to push the band’s sound forward. With the inclusion of some much-needed low end, Eternal Summer’s sonic palette finally sounded big enough to match what appeared to be their own dream-punk goals: songs that range from emotional Marine Girls-like strummers to hyperdriven juggernauts that finally sounded as big and fuzzed out as the band’s own oversized ambitions. </p>
<p class=""p1"">On their third proper full-length—the <a href=""http://www.pledgemusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PledgeMusic</a>-funded and generally excellent <i>The Drop Beneath</i><i>—</i>the band takes another assured step forward. Having generally eschewed any outside producers in the past (<i>Correct Behavior</i> was mixed by Raveonettes’ frontman Sune Rose Wagner and producer Alonzo Vargas, but recorded safely at home in Roanoke by the band themselves), this time the band opted to work elsewhere, relocating to Austin, Texas to record with producer Doug Gillard (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"" target=""_blank"">Guided By Voice</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2997-nada-surf/"" target=""_blank"">Nada Surf</a>). The change of venue and a slight loosening of the reigns seem to have done the band a world of good. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Drop Beneath</i> is the most pristine sounding thing that Eternal Summers have ever recorded. While smoothing away the rough edges seems slightly anathema considering the charm of the band’s early releases, on <i>Beneath </i>the cleaner sound reveals what excellent songwriters Eternal Summers have become. On “Gouge” a galloping guitar melody plays counterpoint to some of Yun’s most arresting lyrics—“Gouge my eyes out/ Cut tongue from my mouth”—all of which are delivered with the sweetness and ardor of a love note. Such is the charm of the album’s best songs—“A Burial” and “Deep End” among them—in which seemingly moribund sentiments are optimistically splayed out against walls of shimmering guitar. And while <i>The Drop Beneath</i> will likely do very little to quell the band’s reputation as savvy 90s alt-rock revivalists—“Keep Me Away” could pass for an <i>American Thighs</i>-era Veruca Salt outtake, not that that’s entirely a bad thing—the band’s frame of reference does appear to have grown. Yun’s voice and the band’s deftness with effects’ pedals might invite easy comparisons to the likes of Lush and pop-inflected shoegaze, but they also make the kind of loopy art-pop that would fit nicely alongside anything Too Pure were releasing back in 1996.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Judging by the overall sense of clarity on <i>The Drop Beneath</i>, it would seem that bringing in an outside producer has mostly been a blessing for the band. Not only does one have a sense of what an excellent and rangy guitarist Yun actually is, her voice is something of a revelation here. On tracks like “Until the Day I Have Won” (in which she sings “Thrill/ is more than a swill/ It's more than what you feel/ It's knowing you've finally got the knack”), she sings with a kind of calm assurance and that previous releases only hinted at. That being said, the production polish can occasionally be a curse. The album’s prettiest songs benefit from the most from the more crystalline proceedings, but the rockers often sound a little restrained. In a live setting there’s no doubt that “100” and “Make It New” would sufficiently shred, but on record one can’t help but wish Yun’s voice would occupy a little less of the sonic real estate and that the guitars were allowed to rip a little harder. Also seemingly out of step on the record is “Not For This One”—a mellow, Feelies-vibed mid-tempo track in which Daniel Cundiff takes over vocal duties. It’s undoubtedly one of the album’s loveliest songs, but it sounds like it could/should appear on a different record altogether—one that perhaps Cundiff (who has a history of contributing vocals to interesting one-offs on previous records) should consider actually making. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In a career that seems predicated on striking some kind of balance—a balance between whisper and roar, messiness and finesse, between articulating Heavenly-style twee bedroom musings versus whipping up walls of roiling melodic noise—Eternal Summers appear to have nearly hit their stride. While nothing here qualifies as any kind of radical reinvention of the indie-rock wheel per se, the band manages to astutely put their own spin on it, seemingly figuring out their own sizable strengths in the process.  </p></div>"|19062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19062-eternal-summers-the-drop-beneath/|7.8|T.

Their work is deliberate kitsch—music for stomping around in jackboots, slickly polished and martial, drawing on imagery and slogans from both Communist and Fascist history. In that context, the title of <i>Spectre</i> is very clearly an allusion to the opening line of <i>The Communist Manifesto—</i>but it's also a description of the current state of the band. Once dangerous political dissidents (they were banned in Yugoslavia for several years), they've gradually become grumpy subcultural fixtures.</p>
<p>Laibach are also, historically, very cagey about who's in the band and who's not: they're a collective, don'tcha know. Nonetheless, it's reasonable to assume that these days they're basically stentorian lead mutterer Milan Fras and whoever else happens to be around. On <i>Spectre</i>, there's a woman with a less prominent accent than Fras' who gets about as much microphone time as he does; is it the group's occasional vocalist Anja Rupel? Cease your impertinent questions, cur. It's <i>a member of Laibach</i>.</p>
<p>For those attuned to the joke, Laibach's music (and the work of the Neue Slowenische Kunst collective with which they're affiliated) is a perpetually jabbing finger aimed at the aesthetic fetishes of military power. For anyone who's not paying attention as closely, it just sounds fetish-y—hence their popularity in goth clubs in the late 80s and early 90s, when they were recording Laibach-ized covers of songs like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and ""The Final Countdown"". Covers, in general, have been Laibach's calling card—their previous non-soundtrack album was 2006's <i>Volk</i>, for which their repertoire was national anthems. </p>
<p><i>Spectre</i>, though, is all new songs, and nobody listens to Laibach for songs; their selling point is attitude, the snarling demands and airbrushed electronic stomp they settled on several decades ago. (A stray name-drop of Occupy Wall Street in ""No History"" is nearly the only sign here that they've been paying attention to the past decade or so; ""Walk With Me"" and ""Resistance Is Futile"" both sound like musical ideas Depeche Mode would have left on the outtake reel circa 1986.) There are some clever arrangements here, like the ""Colonel Bogey March""-ish whistle that opens the album (the song's called ""The Whistleblowers"", and yes, that's an elbow jabbing your ribs), or the chants of ""liver liver liver liver liver"" in ""Eat Liver!"", which otherwise comes off like what would happen if the Russian Police Choir followed up ""Get Lucky"" with a rendition of Suicide's ""Rocket USA"".</p>
<p>Still, the stiffly prefabricated industrial-dance grooves that Laibach habitually fall back on don't quite cut it any more, and without a monolithic state to serve as the object of their satire, they're reduced to mocking political fatuity. The result is sometimes all but indistinguishable from what they're mocking. A lot of <i>Spectre</i>'s lyrics are meaningless up-with-the-people sentiments like ""We're rising higher/ Come don't look back now/ Let's reach the stars"" or ""If you wanna change the world/ You'd better do it with a thrill/ 'Cause if you don't no one else will,"" or equally meaningless intimations of disaster, as when Fras and a synth choir declare ""Europe is falling apart"" in ""Eurovision"" (there's that elbow again).</p>
<p>When <i>Spectre</i> plays its vocalists against each other—Laibach are wise to dialectic if any band is—it sometimes manages to work up a bit of the band's old dissonant dissidence. ""Koran"" contrasts Laibach Woman intoning platitudes (""I believe in a better world... I believe in brotherhood, equality, and freedom"") with Fras growling ""Words are nice/ Words are memories of pain."" The group clearly has plenty of painful memories, but they haven't found new battles they can fight.</p></div>"|19052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19052-laibach-spectre/|4.9|Douglas Wolk

He sells dope off the iPhone. His girls look like money bags. He wakes up to lobster bisque and reclines to the finest crab meats. Ross has pushed pomp at the expense of disclosure ever since he teased a serviceable personal style out of the paint-by-numbers Miami-Dade pimp chronicles of his early career. But what kept these impersonal missives afloat was a theatrical kingpin flair that seemed to expand in relation to attacks on his dominance. In 2009, when 50 Cent unearthed evidence of Ross’ history as a corrections officer, he brushed it off and struck back with the deliciously plush and cartoonishly prideful <i>Deeper Than Rap </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14482-teflon-don/"" target=""_blank""><i>Teflon Don</i></a>. After <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44310-rick-ross-suffers-second-seizure/"" target=""_blank"">a health scare on an airplane in 2011</a>, he puffed his plume further with the Miami Vice villainy of 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rich Forever </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16997-god-forgives-i-dont/"" target=""_blank""><i>God Forgives, I Don’t</i></a>. Ross has spent much of his career running defense against claims he’s lost his touch, even as his kingly seafood diet has been usurped by diced pineapples, but he’s had a tougher time than usual in the past year, as threats from gangs, show cancellations, and a drive-by after a birthday celebration raised salient concerns about his wellbeing. A flippant line about spiking a girl’s drink on trap baron Rocko’s hit “U.O.E.N.O.” reportedly cost him a lucrative promotional deal with Reebok. His Maybach Music Group’s <i>Self Made Vol. 3</i> struggled to connect with a national audience, while a series of fiery solo singles skirted the Billboard Hot 100 entirely. A proposed release date for his sixth studio album <i>Mastermind </i>came and went this past December, and while Ross assured fans he was just “putting final touches on the album,” it looked like the untouchable Maybach Music empire had hit a rough patch.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Mastermind </i>finally lands this week tasked with saving face after a bad year. But <i>God Forgives</i> rode fans’ willful suspension of disbelief raw as Ross anointed himself a pirate, a king, and a president over an album adorned in the gaudiest of embellishments. It doesn’t help that <i>Mastermind </i>finds him slipping from character into caricature. Many of the song concepts here are wan, and much of the wordplay is spent. On “Sanctified”, he’s the “fresh David Koresh,” soliciting grilled cheeses and fellatio from concubines. “BLK &amp; WHT” houses Ross’ third joke about the George Zimmerman trial (“Trayvon Martin, I’m never missing my target”), and the same song’s chorus drably quips that “a nigga black but he sellin’ white.” “Walking on Air” is fashioned entirely out of biblical airballs like “I’m into fashion, nigga, John the Baptist” (whose signature outfit is said to be the hair of whatever wilderness animal he managed to skin) and “Half you niggas Judas, I’m the son of Moses” (whose progeny were passed up as his successors in the priesthood in favor of his nephews). When he’s not falling flat on bad puns, he’s busy hawking his Wingstop restaurants’ lemon pepper chicken wings.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With Ross’ hammy tendencies fading from strength to liability, it’s up to label money and collaborators to save this thing, and bless them all, they tried. <i>Mastermind </i>shines when guest raps from Ross regulars <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a> light a fire under his ass. Wayne and Jay’s great chemistry with Ross proves mutually inspiring for both; “The Devil Is a Lie” nets a better Jay verse than can be found on the majority of <i>Magna Carta Holy Grail</i>, and Wayne’s attack closer “Thug Cry” delivers an intensity recent releases have lacked. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a> rolls a fixation on Chicago drill and Atlanta swag rap cadences, a rousing vocal from soul great Betty Wright, spectral synths and sinewy lows from ratchet maestro DJ Mustard, and Ross’ trademark overindulgence into the regal pomp of “Sanctified” for the album’s high watermark. “Sanctified” is an outstanding entry into Ross and Kanye’s catalogue of stunners, but it never feels like Ross’ song. The same can be said for deep cut “In Vein”, where Ross cedes the reins to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>’s promethazine noir, showing face more than halfway in and skating after a quick verse like a guest on his own record. Similarly, “War Ready”’s bloodless, overlong summit with erstwhile Rozay nemesis Jeezy only takes off when the snowman touches the mic.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When <i>Mastermind</i>’s not clinging to famous friends, it’s thrashing at 90s classics for direction. Early on, following a skit playing 911 call audio from the scene of Ross’ shooting, “Nobody” remakes the Notorious B.I.G.’s unsettlingly fatalistic “You’re Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)”. Given a shot at breaking kayfabe and speaking on the incident, Ross largely opts out, spitting street rap boilerplate in a Biggie cadence he can never quite pull off. “What a Shame” references both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"" target=""_blank"">Wu-Tang Clan</a>’s “Shame on a Nigga” and Camp Lo’s “Luchini (AKA This Is It)” but brings little to the table beyond <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">French Montana</a>’s bratty “Hanh!” ad lib. “Thug Cry” fares better employing the Billy Cobham sample that provided the backdrop for NorCal alt-rap veterans Souls of Mischief’s “‘93 til Infinity” but damn near drowns under a melodramatic sung hook and more lemon pepper wing talk. <i>Mastermind</i>’s sporadic 90s flair feels cursory, but it actually saves the album from a glut of productions all too often beholden to the bleating synths of mid-2000s DJ Toomp and the moody, intricate sounds of Mannie Fresh. The album could’ve used a few more J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League burners and a trap house brawler or two to lift up the sluggish pace. It wraps in just over an hour, but you’ll feel like you’ve been through much more, listening from end to end. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Mastermind </i>finds Rick Ross in the same predicament his mortal enemy 50 Cent experienced when they squared off in 2009. He’s badly in need of reinvention after running out of recipes for his gangster shtick, but he’s too set in his ways to change direction six albums in. <i>Mastermind </i>gestures at Ross inviting us inside his thought process on “Nobody”, where he intimates that he sends a decoy tour bus around the on tour while traveling via private jet, and “Rich Is Gangsta”, which doubles down on the story that his stint as a corrections officer was an intentional ruse. But the moments where <i>Mastermind </i>gives us William Roberts the man instead of Rick Ross the gangster flick composite character with the borrowed name are scarce, and he remains committed to dialing in good life platitudes that increasingly ring hollow. <i>Mastermind </i>finds Ross at a <i>Truman Show </i>moment: his character’s reached the logical end of its universe. Going forward, he can either break out or keep up a jig he knows that we know is way past expired.</p></div>"|19097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19097-rick-ross-mastermind/|5.8|Craig Jenkins

You know that. I know that. I only bring it up because it’s going to frame a great deal of the discussion surrounding recent signee <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31634-nothing"">Nothing</a>’s debut LP <i>Guilty of Everything</i>, which might be unusually heavy dream-pop, billowy alt-rock, or blustery shoegaze, but it is definitely not metal. There’s probably never been a time when wimp panic wasn’t a pressing concern in the metal community, but these are more fraught times than ever judging by the two most controversial records of recent months—countless hours in 2013 were spent debating whether <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven""><i>Deafheaven</i></a> were too soft to be “real metal,” while doomgaze progenitors <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5913-alcest/"">Alcest</a> dropped the “doom” part entirely on the antiseptic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18901-alcest-shelter""><i>Shelter</i></a>. Situated almost exactly between the sound of those two records, <i>Guilty of Everything</i> walks right into the ongoing crossfire, which might actually make it the ballsiest metal album in recent memory.</p>
<p>Whatever guff they get from headbangers, this kind of projected audacity certainly works in favor of a record that doesn’t really have much itself. <i>Guilty of Everything</i> is loud, it’s distorted and it’s heavy, but it’s not aggressive. It’s actually quite comforting. No matter how softly Domenic Palermo sings during the first minute of “Hymn to the Pillory” and no matter how pretty those clean, 8th-note guitar chords are, you’re conditioned to know the tidal crash is coming. And when it does, it’s warm and enveloping, soothing almost. Even the moments of dissonance on <i>Guilty of Everything</i> have an aqueous rather than an abrasive feel; on the stirring single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15909-dig/"">“Dig”</a>, Palermo’s vocals have a steadying effect amidst the seasick, melodic leads while “Endlessly” swoons in the manner of a wave pool, contained, just immersive enough and somewhat menacing if you let your attention slip.</p>
<p>Of course, <i>Guilty of Everything</i> is comforting because it’s familiar as well—25 years of indie rock have been supported by the idea that bludgeoning guitars and vaporous vocals are somehow incompatible and for the first 15 minutes or so, having the opposite once again confirmed can even be kinda thrilling. But after that point, Nothing have pretty much told you all they have to say. That’s in a figurative sense, as <i>Guilty on Everything</i> seems to fold back on itself, its second half repeating certain modes on the first—the “uptempo one”, the “quasi-ambient” one, the waltz. The guitars remain gorgeous throughout, though lacking tonal or dynamic variety and Palermo’s vocals start to take the effect of stale taffy, soft and still retaining its sweetness, but inflexible.</p>
<p>But in a literal sense, you haven’t really heard anything <i>Palermo</i> has to say. Even when pitted against the quietest moments of <i>Guilty of Everything</i>, Palermo’s words are nearly impossible to make out. To be fair, this applies to 99% of all vocalists in this realm. But otherwise, it actually made the lack of specificity even more frustrating. Because you sense there is some kind of personality Nothing can’t quite convey in their music just yet.</p>
<p>I listened t<i>o Guilty of Everything</i> without the lyrics sheet and not much more was revealed after listening <i>with </i>it. Same goes for finding out that the songs were inspired by Palermo’s coming of age in Philadelphia’s extremely shitty Kensington section and serving a two-year bid for aggravated assault and attempted murder. It gives some kind of perspective to typically generalized lyrics like “I’m on my knees...I’m guilty of everything,” and can make this record something of a conceptual piece about the will to live and a death wish somehow converging. But otherwise, a solid debut can’t help but feel just a little disappointing after realizing you could’ve had the doomgaze answer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7808-the-bcoming""><i>The B. Coming</i></a>.</p></div>"|19071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19071-nothing-guilty-of-everything/|6.9|Ian Cohen

Coming in a long rap about fracking, incarceration trends, and, especially, people who shop at Whole Foods while frowning on dudes with sagging pants (“they're white but still like rap”), it's a sharp observation—made sharper by the fact that thematically it's basically a punk song delivered over a skittering trap beat that samples a parrot. This type of witty confusion interlaced with a broader social message is pretty much par for the course for Olaniran. If the winking, Carl-Jung-goes-hip-hop title of the project or its cover showing Olaniran with a grill and a jacket tailored out of traditional Nigerian lace fabric weren't clear enough indicators, let's just say it outright: He's ready to fuck with your expectations.</p>
<p>Part of this approach is simply something that's been thrust on Olaniran, whose music would rather explore identity than adhere to strict, conventional ideas of it. In <a href=""http://www.audiofemme.com/interview-tunde-olaniran/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a>, he's talked about getting dismissed by blogs that say they don't cover hip-hop based on his picture while at the same time making music that didn't seem to belong on rap blogs. But he's also <a href=""http://wdet.org/news/story/tunde-olaniran-hip-in-detroit/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">been a champion of the diversity</a> of the music scene in his home of Flint, Michigan—a city, that, despite a rich musical history, is more commonly associated with industrial decline and crime—and he's vocal about making art from a place as an ally to marginalized groups. A Nigerian-American raised in London, Germany, and Flint whose formative musical experience was touring Europe with Berlin-based producer Phon.o after the two met on MySpace and collaborated, Olaniran's frame of reference is unsurprisingly broad. To further contextualize: He's collaborated extensively with the band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29435-dale-earnhardt-jr-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr</a>., and he's also known to keep a fog machine in the trunk of his car.</p>
<p>Even in this brief five-song offering, Olaniran tries on a lot of different ideas. His approach probably most closely resembles the kitchen-sink genre pastiche and loosely political brio of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a> or, to some extent, the silly perceptiveness and electronic experimentation of rap acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30311-le1f/"" target=""_blank"">Le1f</a>. The product is a pitch-perfect mashup of where pop-leaning underground music, or perhaps underground-aware pop music, stands in 2014, incorporating the rattling percussion of trap and dance music with a presentational, genre-spanning glam sensibility. “The Raven”, for instance, feels a little bit like what would happen if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28682-ellie-goulding/"" target=""_blank"">Ellie Goulding</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a> teamed up to make a song about magic, pairing Olaniran's grandiose, swooping sung vocals with screwed-down raps about “witches in Williamsburg.” “Critical” finds Olaniran doing a solid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a> impression shot through with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a>-style bursts of distortion.</p>
<p>The two-year-old <a href=""http://youtu.be/Bkg4DIJz2A0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Brown Boy”</a> might still be Olaniran's most vital offering, though, a thunderous, clattering four-alarm fire of a song. On ""Brown Boy"", Olaniran calmly cuts through by rapping lines like “And then these questions/ they can really trip me up/ Especially when they prove/ to be real tough/ Like can I be a man?/ Can I not love?” with a sardonic flair that seems increasingly profound on repeated listens. The hook offers a pithy look at racial prejudice that somehow manages to not feel reductive.</p>
<p>Not every moment of <i>Yung Archetype </i>is quite as lyrically smooth. Olaniran sometimes namechecks ideas where it might be useful to explore them, and he also has a tendency toward simple, clever similes like “go hard like Thanksgiving for vegans” that are funny but don't necessarily do much beyond fill space on repeated listens. “The Internet"", while catchy and funny, can feel a little bit circular, since it's a song that will likely be talked about on the Internet that's in part about promoting music on the Internet (on the other hand, that's probably the appropriate feeling for it to have). But these issues are minor qualms that don't necessarily take away from the music and only stand out because of the brevity of the project. For the most part, <i>Yung Archetype</i> is an explosive, dynamic offering from what is clearly a restlessly creative talent. Olaniran's ideas could have massive reach—anyone who seems to gunning for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"" target=""_blank"">Missy Elliott</a> right out of the gate is clearly poised for some big stuff—and this is a great look at that process beginning to happen. </p></div>"|19069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19069-tunde-olaniran-yung-archetype-ep/|7.3|Kyle Kramer

The solo project of Osaka’s Shinya Wada emerged in 2011 during a boom period for Japanese electronic music in the city, but while his counterparts dabbled in Brainfeeder-inspired cosmic beats or maximalist dance sounds, he crafted spacious tracks focused on inducing shivers rather than getting people moving. Other producers around him performed in front of colorful geometric visuals, while Eadonmm plays in front of projections of flames. With his debut, <i>Aqonis</i>, he’s made a shadowy, captivating album that would have easily been lumped in with the micro genre witch house—if it hadn’t become a punch line.</p>
<p>Despite sharing a love of pitched vocal samples and goth-leaning visuals, <i>Aqonis </i>stands out  because Eadonmm establishes a genuinely unsettling mood, something most of the bigger names in witch house never did. He avoids the sonic suffocation and aggression of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""> Salem</a>, instead leaning toward the sparse structures of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28736-ooooo/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">oOoOO</a>. Moments of beauty emerged from the dark corners of those artists' best songs, bits that were often built from warped R&amp;B vocals or YouTube-ripped audio. With Eadonmm, the space only hides more mysteries, each layer revealing a creepier detail nudged forward by skittering beats. He has a specific, very dark sound in mind, and maintains it throughout the album’s run time.</p>
<p>Wada manages this by making sure the music never settles for one loop, letting new sounds creep in whenever possible. “Oblivio Throb” pulses forward, but several vocal whines swirl about and a carnival-appropriate synth line pops up underneath, adding a woozy charm. “Gothic Anamnesis” achieves a similar vibe with rat-a-tat drum programming and water splashes, while lurching centerpiece “If You Melted” unnerves with extended, muffled dialogue and the occasional throaty whisper. These aren’t sonic jump scares, but a bunch of small details creating a larger, unsettling mood. </p>
<p>It's easy to overdo this sort of thing, but Eadonmm paces the album well. Several brief, drumless passages offer space between tracks, allowing for breathing room without sacrificing the ominous feel. Then there are the reminders that, for all the darkness, this project has roots in the club (Wada himself started his own party around Osaka in 2011). Shuffling numbers such as “Tide Up” and “Dim” sound like a more disorienting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28780-holy-other/"" target=""_blank"">Holy Other</a>, and they have enough of a bounce to offer a break from the brooding.</p>
<p>Wada only falters when his work comes too close to pure loop music. Ironically, “Perpetual Goes” fails to go anywhere beyond the hiccuping vocal sample at its core. He fares better on “Alder”, which is also built around a wisp of a voice, though it could've been trimmed down without surrendering any of the otherworldly<i> </i>atmosphere. The one time he pulls off this sort of repetition is on closer, “Post Obit”, a surging noise cut that hits harder thanks to its sudden loudness appearing after the subtler tracks. It's moments like this that showcase the overall strength of Eadonmm's work—he's a producer with an unnerving approach, one where the smallest details come together to form a larger whole that lingers.</p></div>"|19068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19068-eadonmm-aqonis/|7.5|Patrick St. Michel

Known more for his party animal persona than this rapping, he certainly looks the part, like the gold-toothed, frequently shirtless offspring of Ted Nugent. Dirtbag or no, he's an eccentric for sure, evidenced on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14662-sit-down-man/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sit Down, Man</i></a>-era features like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMeAvOgDUdE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Amazing""</a>, which showcased his heavy-lidded but zealous flow. Though his appearances alongside the DR boys felt a bit like charity (or maybe it was because he just felt like one smartass too many), he fared a little better on his own. His 2012 <a href=""http://mishkanyc.bandcamp.com/album/im-in-the-forest-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>I'm in the Forest</i></a> EP found him trying to find his voice in the New York weirdo party rap community, druggily reinterpreting Ja Rule and Ashanti's ""Put It On Me"", dropping smart-dumb non-sequiters (""Chilean with miners but I'm major""), and even offering a few choice tracks (""Lakutis in the House""). Two years later, Lakutis is back with his <a href=""https://lakutis1.bandcamp.com/album/3-seashells"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pay-what-you-want full-length debut <i>3 Seashells</i></a>. Still prone to fits of bizarre leftfield humor, <i>3 Seashells</i> reigns the focus in and unveils a darker, more unhinged version of a man who now compulsively refers to himself as ""skeleton"" (he pronounces it ""skell-a-tawn""). </p>
<p>A few months ago, Lakutis offered up the single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfoj-vSeVeI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jesus Piece""</a>, accompanied by a Tarsem-esque video that found him fighting through a nosebleed and getting covered in gold paint. Nothing too original in the visual department, but the track itself—dystopic, sludge-y, and queasy to the point of needing a Dramamine—felt ahead of the curve. And it's a good way into <i>3 Seashells</i>, which feels like its been informed by horrorcore and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"" target=""_blank"">Wu-Tang</a> in equal measure. It's a record that suggests the person who made it spends more time listening to rap music than actually making it, a paranoid loner with a baggie of bad acid trying to translate a stack of classic 90s New York hip-hop records in his basement. Save for a feature from DVS, Lakutis is on his own here, making an unsubtle statement of independence. Instead, it just sounds like he's scared all of his friends away. Tracks are short and punchy, operating like mini exorcisms or kooky freestyle templates. And while he's still prone to boneheaded provocation—""Skeleton"" sounds like a booty bass track whacked-out on PCP, complete with howling and babbling; ""Mumra"" is a dirge-y black magic chant<i>—3 Seashells</i> reinvents the rapper without skimping on the details that made him oddly compelling in the first place.</p>
<p>Part of this has to do with the production. Helmed by a stable of relative unknowns, the beats on <i>3 Seashells</i> feel cypher-ready but take on more experimental shapes, favoring caustic sounds that give off an eerie, unpredictable impression. SicksentZ's ""Black Swann"" sound like a washing machine with a cinderblock in it trying to recreate the drums on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgSPaXgAdzE&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Loser""</a>; Bill Ding's ""Dope As Fuck"" (which feels like a companion piece to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30648-aap-ferg/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Ferg</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8hzJpeRLG0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dump Dump""</a>) is draped in haunted moans; a creeped out Eastern mystic vibe undercuts Spvce's ""Mumra"". More traditional compositions fit in nicely as well, like previous Lakutis collaborator Steel Tipped Dove's opening two contributions, like the smoker-friendly ""Animal"" or the headknock throwback ""What the Fuck"". Even the goofy lover's rock of ""Body Scream"" manages to charm.</p>
<p>But if you're coming to <i>3 Seashells</i> looking for bars, it's best to look elsewhere. Lakutis isn't big on coherent content, favoring a sort of stream of consciousness approach to his rhyming. Granted, <i>3 Seashells</i> doesn't stray too far from your run of the mill rap hedonism. But his trademark wisecracking is also present, referring to himself at one point as ""Tombstone Pizza Pierre"". Other times, he <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xL3n0L5b8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">waxes Rust Cohle</a>, like on ""Jesus Piece"" (""Look at the fuck have you done/ Made a world where father doesn't know his son/ But the drugs let the child know god if he want""). Lakutis' real strong suit is the <i>way</i> he raps, punctuating words with a visceral intensity usually reserved for the frontman of a hardcore band, his flow almost functioning as a percussive element.</p>
<p><i>3 Seashells</i> was slated to come out late last year, but was pushed back a couple times, with Lakutis repeatedly promising on <a href=""https://twitter.com/LAKUTIS"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> that it would be ready any minute. With this in mind, the album feels a little rushed, and for such a short ride (12 tracks, only three of which scrape the three minute mark, including two brief in-jokes masquerading as skits), there's one or two too many missed targets. Coupled with Lakutis' nagging need to freak out the squares at nearly every turn, <i>3 Seashells</i> is more promising than anything else.</p></div>"|18881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18881-lakutis-three-seashells/|6.7|Zach Kelly

As well it should. The 16-song collection is a murky snapshot of mid-1970s American proto-metal, a loose confederation of groups working mostly in obscurity and isolation that drew on the supple yet thudding heft of Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"" target=""_blank"">Black Sabbath</a>. But unlike the tape-trading metal culture that was just a few years away, these bands had little to no DIY infrastructure through which to spread said sounds. A handful of American groups of that era such as Sir Lord Baltimore and Pentagram managed to persevere, push though, and become better known. <i>Warfaring Strangers </i>pays alms to those who didn’t.</p>
<p>As altars go, there’s plenty to worship. Drawn from 7” singles released throughout the 70s on tiny regional labels across the continent (Toronto’s Sir Lord Baltimore-esque Triton Warrior being the disc’s lone Canadian delegate), the band leading the charge is Medusa, whose full-length, circa-'75 document <i>First Step Beyond </i>surfaced in 2013 and helped bring about this set. “Black Wizard” appears both here and on <i>First Step Beyond</i>. It’s well chosen. Suffused with tape hiss and an almost orchestral gravitas, the song captures occult vibes, galloping dread, and overreaching stabs at jazz-prog virtuosity that lend it an unhinged urgency. The sorcerous, first-person narrative could have been sung from the perspective of Sabbath’s titular “The Wizard”, and as with legions of doom bands to come, Ozzy is held as chief druid. But Tolkien is the demigod: A love of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, then recently popularized in rock thanks to Led Zeppelin, bleeds through on “King of the Golden Hall”—courtesy of Iowa’s geographically displaced Stonehenge—and “Song of Sauron”, a track by Michigan’s Sonaura, who used to spread their harmonized sludge as openers for the Stooges and the MC5.</p>
<p>What makes the bands on <i>Warfaring Strangers </i>so compelling, though, are their idiosyncratic visions of weird America. A decade before Mötley Crüe’s “Shout at the Devil” became the national anthem for would-be suburban warlocks, Tampa’s Wizard—formed by survivors of the 60s teen-garage scene—sang “Séance”, a tuneful, alternately delicate and distorted paean to Satan as a metaphor for the druggy counterculture. In this same environment that their fellow Rosemary’s babies such as Arrogance and Inside (both, miraculously, from North Carolina) converted local bog-water and Heep-worthy organ riffs into the near-Lovecraftian hymns “Black Death” and “Wizzard King”, respectively. Largely unaware of the metal tropes and conventions being carved in stone in the mid-70s—mostly in England, where early metal connected, codified, and thrived—San Antonio’s Hellstorm let the fuzz drift and the funk unfurl. The only African-American group on <i>Warfaring Strangers</i>, Hellstorm ends the anthology on a bloodcurdling note: The decade’s laidback haze is fed, with sacrificial zeal, back into itself.</p>
<p>Numero Group, the label behind both <i>Darkscorch Canticles </i>(as well as Medusa’s <i>First Step Beyond), </i>might have gone a little overboard with the supplemental release of a companion board game titled <a href=""http://www.numerogroup.com/products/cities-of-darkscorch-board-game"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cities of Darkscorch</i></a>. Or maybe the gesture is exactly overboard enough. After all, these bands were not going for realism or restraint, choosing instead to champion an amped-up, all-American arcana for a post-Manson decade in which hippie mysticism had turned ink-black. If <i>True Detective</i> had been conceived in the 70s and set from sea to shining sea instead of the Deep South, <i>Warfaring Strangers</i> might have made for a gloriously eerie score.</p></div>"|19096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19096-warfaring-strangers-darkscorch-canticles/|7.6|Jason Heller

They’ve never made a bad or even a mediocre album in their two decades, even though they’ve given themselves many opportunities to do so. And considering their occasionally acrimonious lineup changes and bold conceptual gambits, they’d have many valid excuses if that fate were to come to pass. But depending on your affinity for 2008’s generous-to-a-fault <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11080-brighter-than-creations-dark/""><i>Brighter Than Creation’s Dark</i></a>, it’s either been six years or 10 since their last truly great album. <i>English Oceans</i> isn’t great, but it’s not mediocre and certainly not bad<span>—</span>but its reception most likely will be predicated on whether or not you think Drive-By Truckers owe you anything more than a “Drive-By Truckers album.”</p>
<p>They seemed due for a shake up, particularly after the hiatus occurring following 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15125-go-go-boots/""><i>Go-Go Boots.</i> </a>Bassist Shonna Tucker (who started contributing songs and vocals on <i>Brighter</i>) and pedal-steel specialist John Neff left the band, while founding members Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley both made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17023-heat-lightning-rumbles-in-the-distance"">solo records</a>. And in several aspects, this is a return to form; <i>English Oceans</i> is much more of a “rock” record than the Muscle Shoals-influenced <i>Go-Go Boots</i>, though DBT have retained enough groove to the point where there’s just as much Stones in their sound as there is Skynyrd, probably more so. And that’s a good thing, as they had the tendency to be a lumbering musical entity even during their peak days.</p>
<p>It’s also the first time since their 2001 breakthrough <i>Southern Rock Opera</i> where the songwriting duties are split solely between Cooley and Hood. More pointedly, it’s the first time the songwriting duties have been split <i>equally</i>. And that allows you to hear Drive-By Truckers in a completely different way, because not only does Cooley reestablish himself after being relegated to a bit player on <i>Go-Go Boots</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13993-the-big-to-do/""><i>The Big To-Do</i></a>, he actually puts this album on his back.</p>
<p>In the past, he hasn’t been underrated so much as overshadowed. Hood’s been often seen as DBT’s head and heart, whereas Cooley operates more from the gut and groin, the sidekick, the comic relief. Cooley still comes up with some instantly quotable, real-talk snark about the sad sex lives of white-collar supervisors (“Trophy tail wives taking boner pill rides for the price of a Happy Meal”) and a henpecked friend (“Said she only hollered when she'd stood as much as she could stand/ Jimmy's ego can take it ‘baby go on and fake it loud as you can’""). But he’s also developed a kind of redneck, cosmic profundity to rival that of early Isaac Brock. While still spoken in plain language, Cooley gets at the kind of accidental enlightenment available to intelligent, if undereducated men given repetitive tasks and a lot of time to mull over things. The construction worker on the shit-hot “Shit Shots Count” notes “Meat’s just meat and it's all born dying.../ Somebody's gotta mop up the A-1 somebody's gotta mop up the blood,” while a tumultuous relationship on “Natural Light” is “As cold as a loveless embrace/ Or hot like a low seething rage.”</p>
<p>Cooley’s superlative performance on <i>English Oceans</i> would be more worthy of celebration if it wasn’t negated by Hood’s most non-committal songwriting to date. “When He’s Gone”, “Til He’s Dead or Rises”, and “Pauline Hawkins” are all variations on the same inert gender dynamics, pro forma Dixie rock with gawky choruses that I suppose one could applaud for being lyrically succinct: “She can't stand to have him around/ But she always misses him when he's gone,” “love is like cancer/ And I am immune,” “She’ll ride him until he’s dead/ Or rises to the occasion.” But Hood never uses these sturdy, nondescript phrases to bear any additional detail or personality, and that’s problematic for a songwriter of his nature: there’s never been a strong melody or a killer riff that’s saved a lyrically weak DBT song.</p>
<p>The gap is even more clear when the duo delve into politics. Cooley’s “Made Up English Oceans” alternates the surreal and hyper-real in a manner similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15120-let-england-shake""><i>Let England Shake</i></a>, invoking right-wing zealots and god-fearing religious factions while leaving worlds open to the interpretation. Conversely, Hood’s “The Part of Him” recalls the strawmanning that marred <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2509-the-dirty-south/""><i>The Dirty South</i></a>, leaning hard on stilted rhymes (“His integrity was phoning in/ Totally Nixonian”) and shrugged jokes about wingnuts and teabags. As with “Pauline Hawkins” and “When He’s Gone”, there’s no sense of place or humanity; it’s something Hood could’ve cooked up after a jag of ""House of Cards"", to say nothing of the likely inspiration for “When Walter Went Crazy”.</p>
<p>Which is to say that the truly great Drive-By Truckers albums may have been unified by a concept, but the great songs they’ve made throughout their career are inspired by <i>real</i> people, whether it’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INHrzNtzTi4&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Living Bubba”</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MIztbe1_e8&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">George Wallace</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvId33nqBG0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the only people in America imprisoned for consensual incest</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOM5-gOnAlc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buford Pusser</a>, or Craig Lieske. If you don’t know the last name, he served as DBT’s merch guy, was a fixture in Athens’ music scene, and <a href=""http://flagpole.com/music/music-features/2013/01/23/athens-remembers-craig-lieske"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">was remembered fondly by his community upon his death in January 2013</a>. He’s the inspiration for <i>English Oceans</i>’ showstopping closer “Grand Canyon”, and it’s DBT’s most musically rich and expansive song to date, seven-minutes of acoustic guitars and vocals that positively gleam in waltz time. Hood’s lyrics are equally up to the task, a meditation on their last great memories with Lieske, the therapeutic value of the road and the supernatural. It’ll probably be their closer for the next decade, and if Drive-By Truckers are still touring in 10 years, that’s a good thing. For now, <i>English Oceans</i> ensures they’ll back on the road, where they’re still one of the best things going and Drive-By Truckers probably don’t owe us much more than that.</p></div>"|18972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18972-drive-by-truckers-english-oceans/|6.7|Ian Cohen

It has little relation to the Hardcore Continuum—that line of distinctly British club music that encompasses Hardcore, Drum and Bass, and UK Garage—instead taking its cues from the rougher areas of Detroit and Berlin, minus the former's futurist escapism and the latter's hedonism. Stern and un-funky by design, UK techno is music for aesthetes, hardscrabble bangers strung together to cleanse and exfoliate. It seems designed not to help clubgoers forget their troubles for a weekend but rather to inspire those clubgoers to bloody their troubles' noses. It's a style that's seen a resurgence in recent years, beginning in part with techno high priest Karl O'Connor (Regis)'s involvement in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31301-sandwell-district/"">Sandwell District</a>—and Berlin's return to harsher clubbing realms—and growing more recently by acting as a refugee camp for dubstep orphans like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29870-blawan/"">Blawan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27930-untold/"">Untold</a>.</p>
<p>Ali Wells, aka <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PercTrax/info"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perc</a>, is at the forefront of this resurgence largely because he's been making scraping techno bangers, with little rest or deviation, since 2002. His <a href=""http://perctrax.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perc Trax</a> label has been a breeding ground for young producers like Truss and Forward Strategy Group, serving as an inspiration to upstart labels like Avian, just as O'Connor's Downwards served to Perc Trax. Wells' debut album, 2011's <i>Wicker and Steel</i>, crystallized this trend, leading <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/oct/04/perc-wicker-steel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Guardian</a> to compare Wells' bleak soundscapes to contemporary Britain's flailing socio-political climate, because sometimes hissy noise isn't allowed to be just hissy noise. Because of all of this, Wells' second album, <i>The Power and the Glory</i>, is expected to be not just another industrial techno record, but a totem release on which this style of music can lean.</p>
<p>The record succeeds, mostly, inasmuch as it reconfirms that Wells is one of the style's most creative deviants. <i>The Power and the Glory</i> is a roiling album that feels looser and more chaotic than the rigid constructs Wells normally works within. Only a handful of the album's 10 tracks adhere to the four-to-the-floor overdriven kicks and unpitched ephemera that remain the backbone of UK techno. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4004-surgeon/"">Surgeon</a> before him, Wells understands an album requires a defter touch than a standard 12"". The album starts slowly with ""Rotting Sound"", one of two collaborations with Dethscalator's Dan Chandler. An unbound mix of speaker static, sampled dialogue, and Chandler's echoing yelps, it's a terrible chore that mostly serves to prevent listeners from getting on with the mashing fun in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>The Power and the Glory</i> fares far better. It's less strict and formalist—and better—than <i>Wicker and Steel</i>, making room for tracks like ""Speek"", an eerie, thrumming soundscape featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"">Factory Floor</a>'s Nik Colk Void and ""Horse Gum"", a dubby, ambient collage. ""Galloper"", a near-breakbeat infused with a sickly organ, has enough space and pacing to spar with London's hipper house producers. Importantly, Wells also finds new and creative ways to pummel. ""Dumpster"", which opens with a wink—some birds chirping over seaside waves—relies, typically, on a monstrously overdriven kick drum, but also features a warped carnival melody. ""David &amp; George"" is a delirious house of mirrors, featuring a nasty, snare-led beat a maniacal cackle.</p>
<p>Like Untold's <i>Black Light Spiral</i>, <i>The Power and the Glory</i> is an album that uses techno's scrape and burn to bring a group of disparate ideas together. Long a purist, <i>The Power and the Glory</i> stands as Wells' boldest and messiest work to date. It's still techno—best used for riling oneself and/or cleansing the palate—but it's techno that veers from its traditional purpose, picking at its scabs and rending its garments. Long a scene steward, Wells greatest contribution is bringing personality to a style that, by its very nature, avoids it.</p></div>"|18978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18978-perc-the-power-and-the-glory/|7.6|Andrew Gaerig

Though the tense New England quartet is itself only two years old, the music they make definitively harkens back at least two decades—when the term indie rock felt a lot less amorphous, when rich regional scenes formed in the most surprising places, when bands from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"" target=""_blank"">Slint</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3763-shellac/"" target=""_blank"">Shellac</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1725-girls-against-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Girls Against Boys</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/123-archers-of-loaf/"" target=""_blank"">Archers of Loaf </a>shaped their own bleeding edge. On two short LP’s, 2012’s <i>SIX</i> and last year’s <i>FIVE</i>, they’ve taken those acts and their associates as chief inspirations, retrenching those sounds with a little metal heaviness. Had Slint made it past <i>Spiderland</i> and tried to concoct a three-minute, tough-guy radio single for the <i>Alternative Nation </i>set, it might have sounded like Empty Flowers’ “Quit”. The knotty shape and recalcitrant delivery of “Police” suggest a songwriter with an affinity for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4441-unsane/"" target=""_blank"">Unsane</a> <i>and</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4427-unwound/"" target=""_blank"">Unwound</a>. Their music suits a crowd for which “remix” can be a dirty word—a gimmicky addition to MAXI CD singles or, these days, the source of an inane viral video hit. Asking such people even to listen to a full LP of such recastings might rightfully raise some questions and eyebrows. Would you really want to hear the house edit of “Breadcrumb Trail”, let alone help pay for it?</p>
<p>Against most odds, <i>The Air You Found</i> is a wonderful seven-song set that delights on its own terms and suggests new possibilities for Empty Flowers, a young band previously hidebound to the past. Empty Flowers’ original “Call a Priest” was a cocksure standoff, with frontman Christian McKenna offering vague threats over flinty guitars and a distant din. But Kevin Hufnagel detects a core of despair in McKenna’s tone and isolates his voice, building around it an ornate cathedral of acoustic guitar. Working as Crone, former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a> member Jeff Caxide inverts the guitar-centric aggression of “Ice on Wings” entirely. He turns the songs into a funhouse mirror drone, where Vocoder vocals pass above a static hum and between space-rock keyboards. There is a beat-machine-buffeted industrial rendering (from Dälek leader Will Brooks, now working as iconAclass) and a collage that pulls a song’s pieces apart and reassembles them in purposely oblong shapes (courtesy of James Plotkin, a nominal metal guy comfortable with infinite genre splices).</p>
<p>But the most engaging pieces here are the ones that don’t subvert or collapse Empty Flowers’ own takes but instead treat them as starting points. Tombs frontman Michael Hill reinforces the anxiety of “Resonate” with massive drums and blanketing synthesizers. He tumbles McKenna’s shouts through a revolving wheel of distress, turning a noise-rock song into a blackened noise span that would feel at home on Hospital Productions. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"" target=""_blank"">Jesu</a> and Godflesh founder Justin Broadrick keys on the presiding drama of and subtle organ peals beneath “Car Fires”, one of Empty Flowers’ best songs. He lets the number plow ahead as intended, but pads out the song beneath it, using the organ as an invitation to place the tune over a bed of luminous choirs and keys. Where the original tune ends, Broadrick marches ahead, using the song’s melody and meter to create a radiant instrumental coda. Its simultaneous heaviness and heavenliness sound like a perfect marriage of Jesu and Sigur Rós. But the Empty Flowers’ song serves as the anchor, preventing the remix from drifting away in its own ethereality.</p>
<p>As compelling as the tracks on <i>The Air You Found </i>can be, what’s most intriguing about the collection is what’s not there: new material from Empty Flowers. Despite their rather rigid songs, they have occasionally shown traces of influences outside of canonical indie and math rock and metal. “Call a Priest”, from <i>SIX</i>, sounds like a missing link between Eric Bachmann’s work in Archers of Loaf and Crooked Fingers, but Empty Flowers added a surprising filigree of digital bursts over its top. And the widescreen arc of “Trained Not to Worry”, from <i>FIVE</i>, suggests the filmic ambitions of the most efficient post-rock acts. But those are only passing moments in a catalogue of consistency. Might these collaborations, however, push Empty Flowers out of their to-date accomplished revivalism, showing them just how far the source of their sounds can be stretched? Imagining them taking austere acoustic detours of their own accord (as Hufnagel has them do) or turning into a drone ensemble (as Crone reshapes them) is a daunting stretch. But perhaps they can borrow those accents from this experience and use the extra textures to finesse their attack. That’s the real brilliance of Broadrick’s rendition of “Car Fires”, which preserves the idea and attitude of the original but shows that the song’s slow-march backbone is only that—an origin, or a central point from which the song and the band itself can spread. Empty Flowers could do well to follow that example.</p></div>"|19042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19042-empty-flowers-the-air-you-found/|7.4|Grayson Haver Currin

But there’s just no getting over that initial impression, the lyrics representing the most prominent of several small flaws that undermine an otherwise solid record. </p>
<p>Thankfully, the strength of the melodies eventually overwhelms the distractions. Though easily nauseated listeners may have trouble sticking around for ""The Morning"", it’s the first track that, even upon an initial listen, is able to transcend its lyrics. That’s partially due to a delightful falsetto from bassist Tomas Høffding. But the song is also a beautifully structured slab of pop, built upon the back of grooving bass and a genuinely stirring chorus, and punctuated by some well-chosen guitar chords. “Another Day” also finds the band in a zone, aping Alex Kapranos’ swagger over some distinctly Franz Ferdinand-esque disco-rock.</p>
<p>Though their songwriting may indicate otherwise, WhoMadeWho have a substantial résumé.  They’re an experimental power-pop group, and have toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Chip</a> amongst others. The latter band is the one they most resemble—the two share the same kind of lurid, almost hyperbolic, pop sensibility, and the Danes are similarly informed by both dance and electronic music, though they also boast the jazz background of the singer/guitarist, Jeppe Kjellberg. </p>
<p><i>Dreams </i>represents a kind of return for the band. Long thought to be hyper-talented underachievers, as famous for what they could be accomplishing as for what they were, the group straightened up with the 2012 album <i>Brighter</i>,<i> </i>leaving behind their more radical leanings for a clean pop sound<i>. </i>The record certainly showed that the band had an ability to get serious, but it also left some wanting the old experimental WhoMadeWho. <i>Dreams</i>, with its ability to shuffle through genres while maintaining a cohesive sound, should please though who were looking for a little more ambition.</p>
<p>WhoMadeWho are blessed to have amongst their ranks the drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30413-tomas-barfod/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Barfod</a>, whose 2012 album <i>Salton Sea </i>gave him a kind of name recognition that, at least here in the States, the band itself has yet to achieve. (He recently released another EP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19012-tomas-barfod-pulsing-ep/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Pulsing</a></i>.) Barfod’s influence is obvious on <i>Dreams, </i>particularly in the tight-locked drumming that drives standout “Indian Summer”, one of the most natural-sounding tracks here.</p>
<p>But even with all that’s going for it, the album never quite manages to reach equilibrium.  Every so often, the band’s facility with the lighter sides of rock devolves into a kind of disco schmaltz. That's the problem with ""Traces,"" which, stuffed as it with offbeat ideas, like droning psychedelic synths and a fake-out bridge, still comes off as vanilla. Then too, there's always the worry that the absurdity of the writing will interrupt the flow, as on ""Hiding in Darkness"", a too-short disco anthem that turns faux-profound as it considers all the possibilities that darkness affords.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>Dreams </i>is filled with danceable, catchy music. But when a band—even one with a dance background—attempts to make an album powered by dynamite pop songs, the songs have to be airtight. WhoMadeWho are hovering on the edge of something big—they have all the talent and creativity required to make innovative pop. But with <i>Dreams</i>, they’re just not quite there yet, again.</p></div>"|19083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19083-whomadewho-dreams/|5.8|Jonah Bromwich

A year later, the message on <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i> is about the same for people who preferred to see them as they were on 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15629-leave-home/"">Leave Home</a></i>, revivalists of nearly every iteration of ugly and abrasive NYC guitar perversion, or as the comprehensive indie-<i>rawkers</i> of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16295-open-your-heart/"">Open Your Heart</a></i>: they’re a rock band and the roll continues.</p>
<p>As with <i>New Moon</i> and <i>Open Your Heart</i>, the Men’s accruing success lends to a welcome, optimistic outlook. There is an element of wishful thinking to <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i>, from its self-deprecating title to the supposedly unintentional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13101-1-record-radio-city"">Big Star homage of the cover</a>. This is the first Men record put together in a high-end studio, though we’re not talking about Capitol Studios; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan"">Bob Dylan </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo"">D’Angelo</a> have walked through the doors of Brooklyn’s <a href=""http://www.strangeweatherbrooklyn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strange Weather</a> and so have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive"">DIIV</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29016-total-slacker"">Total Slacker</a> and O.A.R.. The horns that lace the shitkicking Stones rave-up “Another Night” are supposed to sound like luxuries, though <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i> only sounds more polished compared to the rustic, cabin-tested <i>New Moon</i>. For all of their abrasive tendencies, <i>Leave Home</i> and <i>Open Your Heart</i> were loud and forthright and never sounded lo-fi.</p>
<p>Regardless of the slight upgrade in fidelity, <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i> is much like what preceded it, with “the Men” serving as a fantasy camp construct for the record collectors making this record collector rock. “Get What You Give” has absolutely nothing to do with the New Radicals song, although it does share a taste for bubblegummy riffs and enthusiasm for music making: Chiericozzi literally gets out of bed only to chase the songwriting muse (on several other songs, they sleep in or don’t sleep at all). Even if the songs aren’t necessarily about them, the Men like to play up the transformative power of rock'n'roll, as “Dark Waltz” kicks off <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i> with a litany of classic archetypes: a drummer with a badass, weed-dealing brother and mom buying your first guitar. This story begins in 1974, meaning that Chiericozzi would have to be nearly 50 for this song to be autobiographical.</p>
<p>If you caught them live in 2013, most of these songs should be familiar, since they were all finished and tracked before <i>New Moon</i> was even released. But they’re also familiar in the more general sense, wherein the influences are recognizable to both you, your cooler older sibling, and your dad. <i>New Moon</i> was defined by frayed acoustics and raw soloing, very much in the lineage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2725-meat-puppets"">Meat Puppets</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur, Jr.</a>, bands that were descendents of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5033-neil-young-crazy-horse"">Crazy Horse</a>, but unquestionably indie rock. This is the real-deal stuff, BTO boogie, Skynyrd, and according to the band, a hell of a lot of Ted Nugent.</p>
<p>Say what you will about the Nuge and Grand Funk, they wrote some catchy riffs and the Men are still working their way towards their “Stranglehold”, their “We’re An American Band”. Which is to say that <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i> hints at what <i>New Moon </i>also did—that the Men are great sonic emulators and merely good songwriters. And so, the highlights on <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i> are the ones that recall the velocity of their early work. It’s easy to get caught up in the breakneck pace of “Pearly Gates” and “Different Days” and think “I bet they kick ass live,” but knowing how the Men operate, there’s a good chance that opportunity has already passed you by. Also, some of these sound too familiar in the sense that they’re kinda like older Men songs: “Dark Waltz” is a continuation of <i>Open Your Heart</i>’s barstool-bound “Candy” (really the song that’s determined their path ever since) and “Sleepless” is barely distinguishable from <i>New Moon</i>’s “Bird Song”, whereas closer “Going Down” sounds like “Half Angel Half Light” being workshopped before they found its bracing chorus.</p>
<p>There’s one lyric that sticks out amongst all of this whiskey-slugging and road-dogging, as Ben Greenberg sings on “Different Days”, “I hate being young.” It’s hard to sense much depression or even anger in that line, and not just because it’s surrounded by <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i>’ most revved up performance. It just seems like the Men might hate being young in 2014, as opposed to 1978 or 1969, a time when doing <i>this</i> meant being centrist rather than on the indie rock fringe and having to explain yourself. Even before <i>Open Your Heart</i> dropped, the Men wanted to stress that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8759-the-men/""><i>Leave Home</i> wasn't ""them.""</a> But the greatness of those two records lay in how it was impossible to tell who the Men really were; they sounded capable of doing <i>anything</i>. And hell, being a solid rock band doing yeoman’s work year after year suits them, even if it results in very good records that get them right back out on the road rather than great ones. Who knows if the Men would be energized or completely lost if they took more time next time out, but <i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i> for now mostly succeeds in toeing the line between being on a roll and being in a rut.</p></div>"|18971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18971-the-men-tomorrows-hits/|7.2|Ian Cohen

That the musician born Ryan McRyhew started out on a more IDM tip, moved to Chicago from Denver a couple years ago, then moved back out a couple years later, bringing an evangelical enthusiasm for old Trax Records 12"" classics back with him? That's the way a lot of super-suspect appropriation nightmares start.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But that's also how a lot of engagingly weird cross-genre works happen, and Thug Entrancer's full-length debut album </span><i>Death After Life</i><span>—his breakthrough release on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Lopatin</a>'s Software label—is more definitively a bold experiment than a cheap jack move. McRyhew's context has always been that of the generation that grew up with the idea of digital music as a normalized way of making things, from formative </span><span>Mario Paint </span><span>experiences onwards. So when </span><i>Death After Life </i><span>touches on a blend of styles, it comes across less like a cultural lift and more like someone finding a new element to add to the periodic table of beats.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's tempting to call what </span><i>Death After Life </i><span>does ""microjuke,"" at least in its more obvious moments. The focus cut, ""Death After Life I"" (all eight non-bonus cuts follow the title + roman numeral format), fits that descriptor most readily, spilling its footwork guts out with a stripped-down, chromed-out flourish and making sure the drum patterns are as frantic and agitated as the synth washes that act as de facto melody are floaty and light (if occasionally distorted to subtly unnerving did-I-just-hear-that? effect). The way McRyhew builds a beat comes across like an overflow of ideas, as if the opportunity to toy with the rapidfire snares, claps, and kicks of juke rhythms opens up so many variations he can't help but leap from one to another, chopping the one into fractions and shuffling it around like a blackjack dealer's cards.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Juke isn't the only ingredient in </span><i>Death After Life</i><span>, though—McRyhew puts his work together like somebody who spent decades listening to Roland-powered music and, finally given the chance to make some of his own, goes all shopping spree with it</span><span>. So there's a thread running through this record that actually does juxtapose some of Chicago's core styles—not just juke and footwork, but ghetto and acid house, bracingly put through the wringer on ""III"" and ""V"". Granted, he's stripped out some of the crucial elements that make the material that inspired him so vital—with sparse exceptions, it doesn't push the BPMs to the 150-160 mark, and good luck finding an actual vocal sample anywhere on here—his ear for pitting the kind of slow-build chord progressions usually found in more ambient and minimalist works against that sort of dense rhythmic syncopation is well-tuned.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Death After Life </i><span>gets a little cute here and there (cf. the extended roboseizure freakout outro to ""III""), and it starts to lose a little steam near the end, when the downtempo digression of ""VI"" and the hopped-up yet unsurprising ""VII"" roll towards the official conclusion. The QED of ""VIII"" pulls out every genre-Cuisinart trick in Thug Entrancer's book to strong effect, and the bonus tracks of ""Ready to Live"" parts 1 and 2 show what he can do with his focus elsewhere—turns out he can get just as rhythmically berserk with neighbor-alienating bass hits as he can with drum elements. Whether this infatuation with the sounds of the South Side are a passing phase or a legitimate connection remains to be seen, but it's clear there are plenty of places Thug Entrancer can take it. And if Ryan McRyhew is a dilettante, then hey, looks like sometimes even dilettantes hit on something.</span></p></div>"|19067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19067-thug-entrancer-death-after-life/|7.6|Nate Patrin

The largely anonymous London-based producer has been around for a while, releasing music by others on his <a href=""http://www.k-is-for-kaleidoscope.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kaleidoscope</a> label, and making his first venture as patten with a CDR titled <i>There Were Horizons</i> back in 2007. His first official release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16008-patten-glaqjo-xaacsso/""><i>GLAQJO XAACSSO</i></a> for <a href=""http://nopaininpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Pain in Pop</a>, demonstrated his <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a> fandom. This new collection, <i>ESTOILE NAIANT</i>, offers an alteration of the patten sound, picking up a thread from the more thought-out structures of last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18792-patten-eolian-instate-ep/""><i>EOLIAN INSTATE</i></a> EP, where room to breathe became as important as the restricted spaces of his prior work.</p>
<p>Throwing a veil of anonymity over proceedings rarely has the desired effect, often drawing attention to the personality behind the music instead of deflecting attention away from it. Just look at the endless questions that were raised in online discussions about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>'s pre-selfie identity, and the by-now quite tedious (and, at times, <a href=""http://burialisfourtet.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">baffling</a>) trove of misinformation trailing in his wake. ""I wonder whether the focus could remain more fully on the materials produced without it being about the person, or people, who made it as such,"" patten said in an <a href=""https://www.thefader.com/2013/12/05/dollars-to-pounds-patten-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, on his desire to remain unidentified. Drawing such a big question mark, and making oblique <a href=""https://twitter.com/patttten"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> posts and statements like ""best and worst don't actually exist"" (from the same interview), make it feel like he's craving attention, not shrinking from it. Besides, he doesn't appear to have much in his locker to differentiate himself from others who have chosen this path.</p>
<p>The net result of the half-thoughts that make up the patten mythos throw the music into a certain light, depending on how it's received. Certainly, if you buy into it, your expectations are likely to be raised. The ideas behind the music of <i>ESTOILE NAIANT</i> mostly work as a reflector of the energy he's using to construct a world outside the music, where tried-and-tested concepts are executed with a degree of precision, occasional inspiration, and a sizable volume of backward referencing to ground already covered elsewhere. It often skirts around junior Autechre mode, where jarring noises barely fit together and accelerate toward a place of further disharmony as the track progresses (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16476-drift/"">""Drift""</a>, ""Key Embedded""). In softer territory the spectre of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> is undeniable (""23-45""). At times, on the better material here, patten builds a satisfyingly awkward bridge between his inclinations to amble and to stick a fork in his machinery (""Agen"").</p>
<p>Bringing together strange juxtapositions produces some of the strongest work on <i>ESTOILE NAIANT</i>—the broken-down drum kit skittering over a faltering loop on ""Gold Arc"", the finicky beat set to a whistling motif on ""Winter Strobing"". But there's rarely a sense of direction, with tracks that build into turmoil often gaining superfluous extra layers, and works that fade into the shadows feeling oddly inconsequential. The overwhelming mood is one of ideas gathered, processed, and left to dangle in the air without much to frame them. ""Maybe there's something interesting about finding methods of working where you can transcend your imagination so you’re not necessarily beginning with an end in sight,"" patten told <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/features/patten-interview-trying-to-describe-dreams"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dummy</a>, in a 2011 interview. On <i>ESTOILE NAIANT</i> it feel like that approach still informs what he does, but music that works effectively without end, that circles in place, still needs to find a strong position in the world.</p></div>"|19035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19035-patten-estoile-naiant/|6.0|Nick Neyland

Between his main gig as a drummer for off-kilter electro-pop trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29595-whomadewho/"" target=""_blank"">WhoMadeWho</a>, his partnership with compatriot Kasper Bjørke as straightforward house duo Filur, and his own burgeoning solo career, Barfod’s had a major hand in nearly a dozen full-lengths since 2000. He’s not showing any signs of slowing, either, with two releases due in the first quarter of 2014 alone: WhoMadeWho’s fifth album, <i>Dreams</i> (due out March 3 on the band’s own imprint), and his own <i>Pulsing</i> EP, which follows 2012’s solid debut solo LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16790-salton-sea/"" target=""_blank""><i>Salton Sea</i></a>.  <br/><br/> Though it borrows <i>Salton Sea</i>’s structure of alternating vocal and instrumental tracks, <i>Pulsing</i> is a much leaner affair, running its course in a brisk eighteen minutes while the former stretches over an hour. Barfod has cut down on the individual bloat, too, his average runtime having shifted from over five minutes on <i>Salton Sea</i> to well under four minutes on <i>Pulsing</i>. This newfound concision is accompanied by a parallel increase in focus: where Barfod once delivered a survey glance at electronic music—floaty vocal electro-pop, playful house, meandering headphone fodder—he now sticks to a rigid dichotomy: sharp, finely sung pop in one hand, and moody instrumental cuts in the other. You get the sense that Barfod digested the disproportionate praise given to <i>Salton Sea</i> standouts like “November Skies” and “Don’t Understand” and decided to double down, directing all of his straightforward compositional energy into a pair of stunners and using his instrumental tracks as a repository for stranger ideas. <br/> <br/> If there’s any legitimacy to that strategy, then it certainly paid off. <i>Pulsing</i>’s title track finds Barfod reuniting with Swedish vocalist <a href=""http://ninakinert.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nina K</a>, who guested on the aforementioned “November Skies” and one other selection from <i>Salton Sea</i>, and their partnership continues to bear fruit: “Pulsing” takes a churning polyrhythm and uses it to anchor a bittersweet, subtly sticky pop song. Barfod’s roots as a drummer snake through the song, presenting themselves in the way Nina crams impressive numbers of syllables into the verses with quasi-mechanistic precision; there’s a delicate balance between complexity and catchiness at play that belies Barfod’s talented hand for pace. <br/> <br/> “Happy” isn’t quite as successful, but its bruised, downtempo melancholy is a neat change of pace from the brighter, glossier sound of “Pulsing.” The song’s relatively obscure guest and unlikely backstory overshadow its musical merits: Barfod met Eddie Chacon, of 90s R&amp;B one-hit wonder <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UXvcr22rM&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Charles &amp; Eddie</a>, in an L.A. dollar store, and discovered their musical connection after a few drinks in a nearby bar. Chacon provided the lyrics to “Happy,” a reflection on the scores of his contemporaries who have passed away over the last few decades, and his contribution lends the song an emotional weight it would surely lack otherwise. <br/> <br/> <i>Pulsing</i>’s instrumental tracks are a little more hit and miss. “Tea Cup” is the better of the two: it’s buzzy, flecked with guitar, and ripe with skittering layers of rhythm, like the best B-side from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15149-the-king-of-limbs/"" target=""_blank""><i>The King of Limbs</i></a> you’ve never heard. Barfod clearly has the ability to inject some vitality into the kind of electro-rock hybrid that’s rarely pulled off well, and it would be fascinating to hear him delve deeper into that side of his potential on a future release. “Value of Feint” hews closer to his previous work, but lands in an anemic middle ground between grand instrumental balladry and chilled-out synth noodling that relegates it to secondary status on the EP.<br/> <br/> While the remix of “Pulsing” by Boston producer J£zus Million that book-ends the EP doesn’t quite succeed on its own merits, it ultimately sheds more light on Barfod’s strengths as a producer through its failure. Million recasts the song as a ghostly, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>-ian electro-soul ballad, and though he knows his way around a pitch shifter, he robs “Pulsing” of the twisting rhythmic core that works as the heart of Barfod’s original. Perhaps it isn’t a surprise that a drummer by trade peaks as a producer when playing with rhythms, but <i>Pulsing</i> makes it clear that Barfod’s assessment of his own skills is right on target. </p></div>"|19012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19012-tomas-barfod-pulsing-ep/|6.9|Jamieson Cox

Both record sample-heavy, hyperactive electronic music under projects named after parts of their name (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31538-obey-city/"" target=""_blank"">Obey City</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31927-seiho/"" target=""_blank"">Seiho</a>, respectively). Obey helped organize the <a href=""http://astronauti.co/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Astro Nautico</a> collective label, which has released music from up-and-coming producers including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31225-the-range/"" target=""_blank"">the Range</a>. Hayakawa, meanwhile, played a pivotal role in starting his hometown’s influential <a href=""http://innitmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">INNIT</a> party and launched <a href=""http://daytripperrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Day Tripper Records</a>, which has housed some of the best young electronic artists in Japan. Now, their individual projects are growing in prominence, as Obey City entered the <a href=""http://thisisluckyme.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LuckyMe</a> fold and Seiho has attracted more attention domestically and even started working with more major-label acts. Seiho’s imprint and Astro Nautico teamed up for a <a href=""http://astronauti.co/7-by-7-astro-nautico-x-day-tripper/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">release</a>, and this February Obey City did a brief Japanese tour, with Hayakawa co-headlining. <i>Shochu Sounds </i>is a split EP created for this recent sojourn, featuring a pair of tracks from each.</p>
<p>Of the two, Obey City comes off as more laid-back here. He opens <i>Shochu Sounds </i>– which continues Obey’s boozy album streak, starting with last year’s <i>Champagne Sounds </i>and a promised <i>Merlot Sounds</i>—with “Wait,” a luxurious bouncer built around a modified vocal sample and what sound like hiccups deeper in the mix. Although he’s not afraid to play around with tempo and let the synths twist around, “Wait” is at its best when it’s marinating in those pitched voices and an especially enjoying-itself moan punctuating how great this all feels. “Proceed” adds more oomph to Obey City’s sound, primarily via tuba-assisted squanks running underneath everything else. Whereas “Wait” makes every second sound decadent, “Proceed” goes on a little longer than it should.</p>
<p>Seiho’s contributions, meanwhile, can barely stay put. His earliest recordings tended to be spacey, slow-burning works, but he’s shined since he’s embraced a herky-jerky approach where he locks synth zig-zags and bursts of samples into a coherent track. “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16624-double-bed/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Double Bed</a>” is a perfect example. Sounds zip in for brief stops before whirling out, never to be heard again. At one point, a horn plays before everything slows down for some bird chirping, a brief catch-your-breath moment before “Double Bed” swirls back into cartoon-tornado form, a jumble of start-stop vocals and electronics. It’s hyperactive, but also playful, one of Seiho’s best characteristics. His other number, “Koi"", aims for more dramatic levels, blurring classical Japanese instrumentation with digital noise.</p>
<p><i>Shochu Sounds </i>works as a solid introduction to each artist, and can hopefully serve as a diving board into their 2014 outputs. Obey City’s <i>Champagne Sounds </i>shows off his range as a producer while also being built for booming sound systems, while Seiho’s <i>Abstraktsex</i> demonstrates that his hurly-burly approach can result in a great full-length album. Still, even if the four songs are better entryways into other works, <i>Shochu Sounds </i>is still a good offering from two producers to keep tabs on.  </p></div>"|19082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19082-obey-city-seiho-shochu-sounds/|6.8|Patrick St. Michel

The lyrics, meanwhile, were mantras best understood with a beer koozie gripped in one hand: What you want is just beyond your reach; keep on trying. Whoah, it's real. Budweiser, Sprite.</p>
<p>On <i>Atlas</i>, their basic sound hasn't changed—frontman Martin Courtney's clean-strummed open chords, Matt Mondanile's bright leads, and a light-stepping rhythm section all squish together comfortably like college housemates sprawled on a sectional sofa—but the mood has. ""I'm just trying to make some sense of this before I lose another year,"" shrugs Courtney on ""The Bend”. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16682-real-estate-crime/"" target=""_blank"">""Crime""</a>, he sings ""Toss and turn all night, don't know how to make this right/ Crippling anxiety."" The once-ideal pool party band, in other words, has turned to soundtracking the cleanup: Everyone's gone, the sky's threatening rain, there are cigarette butts floating in the pool, and we've all gotta work tomorrow.</p>
<p>The result is at once their most forlorn album and their most beautiful. Producer and mixer Tom Schick dissolves the noncommittal haze of reverb that made it sound like you were hearing <i>Days</i> through a fisheye lens, and the crispness that emerges on <i>Atlas </i>is gorgeous. Courtney’s tenor is soft and even, and the room tone is bruised-ripe like an October sunset. In this soft light, the band sounds like the platonic ideal of themselves, and it’s difficult not to wish all their albums had been recorded this way.</p>
<p>The clarity of <i>Atlas</i> underlines what an uncommonly graceful unit they are. Real Estate essentially has two lead vocalists—Courtney’s tenor on the one hand, and Mondanile’s pearly guitar melodies on the other. The two voices enjoy a near-telepathic relationship, and it’s almost impossible to imagine Courtney’s singing without Mondanile’s guitar twirling around it, and vice versa. As the tabbed tutorial they posted for “Crime” underlines, nothing anyone is playing would tax a first-year guitar student. But their two voices, working modestly and in perfect sync, key into a mysterious and powerful emotional calculus. When the bell-clear leads rise out of on ""The Bend"" and""Navigator"", they feel like spontaneously welling tears.</p>
<p>This simplicity and eloquence is the key to <i>Atlas</i>’ surprisingly profound ache. Courtney’s words tend to mention the same things over and over—the sky, the horizon, the sidewalk, the houses on his block—but he’s not repeating himself. He’s shaping the contours of a world, one that's built on a sense of cosmic gratitude matched by an equal and opposite sense of cosmic loss. “I don’t need the horizon/ To tell me where the sky ends/ And it’s a subtle landscape/ Where I come from,” he sings on “Had to Hear”. “Just over the horizon/ That’s where I always think you’ll be/ It’s always so surprising/ To find you right there next to me,” he sings tenderly on “Horizon”. The bittersweet disorientation of these two competing thoughts—I’ve lost more than I’ll ever know, I have more than I ever imagined—mark out a very particular phase of life, and it’s one Courtney is currently in the throes of: He’s about to have his first child.</p>
<p>This is a life moment when you engage in a little less dreamy reverie about who you might be, and begin assessing, with some alarm, who you have already become. If you’re lucky, like Courtney, you are roughly pleased with what you find, even as you squint bewildered into the recent past to mark the notch where the transition happened. “I remember when/ This all felt like pretend/ And I still can’t believe,” he marvels on “Crime”. “I’m staring at the hands on the clock/ I’m still waiting for them to stop” he sings on “Navigator”, the album’s final song and one of many bemused meditations on the passing of time. Real Estate have weathered some jam-band comparisons, and Alex Bleeker is an avowed fan of the Grateful Dead, so it feels like a permissible stretch to note that the shadow of a very particular Dead song—the wry, valedictory “Touch of Grey”—seems to hover over <i>Atlas</i>. Like that song, <i>Atlas</i> assesses the current moment, and everything leading up to it, with a puzzled head scratch and shit-eating grin.</p>
<p><span>Real Estate are a deeply suburban band, and the shade of long tree-lined streets, the lonely symmetry of the houses, rise up continually out of their music</span><span>. If it has been too easy to underestimate Real Estate in the past, it might be in part because of this: Suburbs are not often stages, in the popular imagination, for great existential drama. They are places of reverie, of absence, into which the drama of the real-world intrudes. But </span><span><i>Atlas</i> </span><span>gazes calmly and wisely into the face of some troubling questions: Mortality, the passing of time, the problem of loneliness. With it, Real Estate have made more than just their third excellent record in a row, more than just their best-ever record. They’ve made the first record of their career that feels like it might teach you something over time. It is rare, and special, for a band to be this effortlessly and completely themselves. </span></p></div>"|19060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19060-real-estate-atlas/|8.8|Jayson Greene

His sophomore effort behind the boards as cartoon commando/cyborg <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"" target=""_blank"">Major Lazer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17627-major-lazer-free-the-universe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Free the Universe</i></a>, found the producer and partners Jillionaire and Walshy Fire spreading themselves too thin and sacrificing any chance at cohesiveness in the name of versatility. An autumn EP under his own name, <i>Revolution</i>, was stuffed to the gills with satisfying drops, but felt more like a grab-bag of trend-riding cuts than a thematically sound articulation of his strengths. Never one to rest on his laurels, he’s already back with another EP, this one back in the guise of Major Lazer; <i>Apocalypse Soon</i>, like its predecessors, is rich in guest stars and attempts to bring nuclear-level energy to the world’s dance floors.</p>
<p>While Major Lazer’s primary incarnation—one that included fellow DJ/producer Switch and hype man extraordinaire Skerrit Bwoy—was rooted in the export and steroidal electro-amplification of Jamaican dance music, the purity of that concept has long since been diluted, and <i>Apocalypse Soon</i> doesn’t mark a return to any such thematic consistency. Its opener, “Aerosol Can"", is less a representative statement than the equivalent of throwing your best pitch first: Diplo wisely capitalizes on the exploding star of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell Williams</a>, currently hitting an unexpected peak as a mainstream musical force and experiencing a broader creative renaissance. While “Aerosol Can” is ripe with fascinating textural work—the hollow, tinny spray and pressurized rattle of the titular can is ear-catching in the best way—it’s foolish to pretend that the song is anything other than the ultimate exercise in “your mileage may vary”: it hinges on how you feel about Pharrell, both as a personality and a rapper. A useful heuristic already exists in the form of his batty, scene-stealing verse on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a>’s monstrous single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16612-future-move-that-dope-ft-pharrell-pusha-t-and-casino/"" target=""_blank"">“Move That Dope”</a>: if you’re down with #GandalfHat, “Aerosol Can” will tickle your fancy with lines like, “Make yourself bigger like mushroom/ Mario Kart.” Just don’t press play expecting anything resembling a traditional hook. <br/> <br/> At least “Aerosol Can,” for all its simplicity, picks an idea and sticks with it; several of <i>Apocalypse Soon</i>’s other tracks jump from sound to sound with reckless abandon and remarkable volatility, and suffer for it. It’s a relatively minor issue when the hyperactivity takes time away from worthwhile ideas that could use a bigger chance to shine: “Sound Bang,” featuring soca star Machel Montano, leaps from a breezy, lilting beach circle to a hard-charging, strobe-lit club to some sort of hybrid atmosphere and back at whiplash-inducing speeds, but the discrete sections are compelling enough on their own to warrant further exploration. But the excess kinetic energy is a bigger problem when it feels like a diversionary tactic, a distraction from compositions lacking real hooks or momentum. “Lose Yourself” and “Dale Asi” are dense with the sort of drops, rapid shifts, and dynamic plays that need just a tiny substance-aided push to become interesting, but listening to them under normal circumstances is like watching a game of three-card monte once you’ve picked up the keys to the con: an eye on the tricks of the trade spoils the illusion. <br/> <br/> It’s disappointing that these songs don’t have the bones to stand on their own, especially since a precedent for truly great Major Lazer songs exists: older cuts like “Keep It Goin’ Louder” (still one of Diplo’s finest musical moments, bar none) and last year’s Amber Coffman collaboration “Get Free” work as both genre exercises and straightforward pop triumphs. <i>Apocalypse Soon</i>’s best song doesn’t quite scrape those heights, but its relative coherence and catchiness places it a head above its counterparts on the EP. “Come On to Me” is anchored by a vintage performance from none other than Sean Paul, whose thick-tongued patois and ability to navigate a hook remains intact even a decade removed from his <i>Dutty Rock</i> heyday. But the song’s merits extend past its vocalist’s charisma: it actually feels like a song with a structure and a fully realized mood, rather than a Frankenstein held together by drops or a sketch. It’s just too bad that “Come On to Me” is the exception on <i>Apocalypse Soon</i> and not the rule. </p></div>"|19047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19047-major-lazer-apocalypse-soon-ep/|5.8|Jamieson Cox

It was a blend that carried over from (and into) their own work, a global-disco idealism more grounded in the universal pull of the emotions they could wring from these sounds than the ""exotic"" status of the locales they originated from. It doesn't take a lot of stretching to picture their blends booming out of cars in their homebase L.A. (or Miami or NYC)—it's American music for an America where what we take in means more than what we ship out.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like the first </span><i>Perfect Lullaby</i><span>, it definitely helps on a source-quoting, credit-due level to understand where the inspiration on </span><i>The Perfect Lullaby II </i><span>comes from. This is a mix where Afro-Portugese music spun by club DJs in Lisbon—DJ Fofuxo, DJ Lil Thug, DJ Dadifox—are snuck under Aaliyah classics (""Hot Tarraxa/Don't Think They Know"") or a Ciara remix of a Chris Brown track (""Tarraxo Deuces""). It's where reggaeton vets Nova &amp; Jory (""La Noche Perfecta"") are slotted between a couple post-Moombahton Dutch house cuts—outfit M&amp;N Pro's Cape Verdean flip of Usher's ""Let Me See"" and a Zouk remix of another Brown track, ""Another Round"", by DJ Phraze. It's where the two members of Nguzunguzu themselves—Asma Maroof credited on a few edits as ""MA""; Daniel Pineda as ""NA""—fit the pieces together with minimal tweaking while still hiding the seams expertly. The transitions hop continents without a hitch.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But for those less curious about the specific nuances of zouk and kuduro and kizomba, the appeal is still there in an immediate sense of style. The specific throughline on this mix is the less heavy, more bucolic and dreamlike angles of this diasporic beat, which opens with rainshowers and robin calls before layering a delicately resonant spacedrum solo by Yuki Koshimoto over the sparse but waist-winding zouk-bass of DJ Fofuxo &amp; DJ Pausas's ""Tarracho Exxelentt"". And there's this juxtaposition throughout, where these persistently churning drums and basslines are set alongside R&amp;B divas and slow-jam loverman cuts—not quite softening the beats, but giving them this pulse of romanticism and intimacy that stands out just as strongly as the groove.</span></p></div>"|19065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19065-nguzunguzu-the-perfect-lullaby-vol-2/|7.8|Nate Patrin

If you’re even luckier, he’ll put on a tune like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ExifQpk99k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Party Time”</a> by the Heptones. The tell-tale alto sax line leading to Leroy Sibbles’ plaintive voice singing “Time is short so hear me man, let’s live the life the best we can, don’t try to work your soul away.” Members of the crowd will smile, sway and slow dance.

This is Jamaican rocksteady.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sure, it may not be possible to jump on an airplane and get yourself to Rae Town in time for this Sunday’s dance, but you could do much worse than Soul Jazz’s excellent collection of <i>Rocksteady, Soul and Early Reggae from Studio One</i>. This is music from the mid-60s—an in between era for Jamaican music that is often characterized by <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/duke-reid-sir-coxsone-dodd-beef-patty"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Duke Reid</a>’s Treasure Isle label. But where Reid’s rocksteady really took its cue from US soul and R&amp;B, Studio One was, as reggae historian and liner note writer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bass-Culture-When-Reggae-King/dp/0140237631"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lloyd Bradley</a> suggests, more experimental. And, perhaps, as can be heard from the often love-laden tunes showcased on <i>Rocksteady</i>, from Alton Ellis’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY3-6B2Vvi4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Hurting Me”</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNDhUtKt_bU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Me and You”</a> by Carlton and the Shoes, more soulful. As smooth as the vocals are, the sounds of Sir Coxone Dodd’s label at this time is music easy to imagine on a soundsystem—and, as Klassique demonstrates on a weekly basis, was and is best heard loud and bass heavy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For those well steeped in the music of Jamaica, this is not a set of rarities, but rather a collection of tunes that can set a mood. The set contains the excellent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17ZTE-2_Hx0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Stars”</a> by the Eternals, the original <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Campbell"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cornell Campbell</a> voicing of the now well-worn riddim. The keyboard virtuoso <a href=""http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/releases/?id=186"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jackie Mittoo</a> is on show on the joyous <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF4cWecWBZ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Our Thing”</a> and there’s a taste of legendary <a href=""http://www.lee-perry.com/index2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lee Perry</a>’s early productions, even at this time displaying his penchant for organic depth in his sound. A case in point is here next to the always spectacular vocals of the Crown Prince of reggae, Dennis Brown, on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkYyyoXbowo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Easy Take it Easy”</a>, and one of the tunes from one of Jamaica’s most well-loved vocalists, Ken Boothe, with his trademark enunciation and vibrato on <a href=""http://youtu.be/FJ_xfZGxTFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Home Home Home”</a>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s near impossible to not nod one’s head to John Holt’s Perry-produced warning against <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT29OQI9lIA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Fancy Make Up”</a> girls who will “rob and cheat you, make you wanna cry” and the Wailing Souls’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxkHybdPgTA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Row Fisherman Row”</a>—the title a metaphor for what you need to do when love just aint working out and not an original version of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JhTM0Lar3Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Congo’s more literal version</a> recorded in the heart of the reggae era of the late 1970s. But not every tune on this set deals with the trials and tribulations of romance. There’s Larry and Alvin’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HK3HvFteLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Throw Me Corn”</a> that speaks to those fussing, fighting, stealing and killing as well as <a href=""http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20140201/ent/ent1.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marcia Griffith</a>’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTMbHaLySxU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“My Ambition”</a>, communicating not only the striving of the singer, but that of a recently independent Jamaica. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Throughout Bradley’s extensive liner notes shines a passion for the music and the history—he situates this American-soul influenced sound sandwiched by the bounce of early-60s ska and the sway of the reggae to come, pointing out the bits and pieces of each song that you should be paying attention to. He also makes an argument that Studio One, while not as exemplary of the rocksteady style as other labels like Treasure Isle, presented important innovation in the music essential to its eventual development into reggae. But even without the history, the importance, and the ins and outs, this music isn’t as much of an intellectual pursuit as it is a pleasure in every note. As Bradley observes, it really is smooth stuff; there are few horns, and songs are driven by vocal prowess and bass groove. These are songs that demonstrate tremendously tight vocal arrangements and exude the ease of a growing music industry that is just chock full of creativity, developing a unique sound in every single. </p></div>"|19019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19019-soul-jazz-presents-studio-one-rocksteady/|8.1|Erin MacLeod

He makes instrumentally ornate folk music unafraid to bust out a pump organ or kalimba to locate an archaic emotion, and sings with an idiosyncratic falsetto that gives credence to the description “God-given.” Recording as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1272-death-vessel/"" target=""_blank"">Death Vessel</a>, Thibodeau released two albums in 2005 (a year when the popularity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"" target=""_blank"">Devendra Banhart</a>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/"" target=""_blank""><i>I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning </i></a><span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bright Eyes</i></a> and half the Arts and Crafts roster made him an obvious debut) and 2008, then fell off the radar. Six years later, he’s returned with </span><i>Island Intervals</i><span>, an album recorded in Reykjavik that invites us to tour his world. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s impossible to discuss Death Vessel without mentioning Thibodeau’s voice, which is piercing and shrill and whatever other pejoratives might’ve been thrown at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a> circa “Peach, Plum, Pear”. It’s deeply committed to a particular feeling, and might not evoke more sympathy from some beyond, </span><span>Dude sounds like a lady</span><span>. But it’s perfectly suited for songs in which medieval worlds are conjured to contextualize fragile emotions that might be a little impenetrable were they rendered in a more modern cadence. Try to imagine the singer of any butt-rock band yelling, “For the nonce I will dream of when we jointly preened triangulated heart.” The simplest way I can put it is that this is an album for people who wouldn’t have minded if the </span><span>Lord of the Rings</span><span> movies spent a little more time with the elves—for people who have been known to remark at parties, “There’s actually a lot more to Tiny Tim than ‘Tiptoe Through the Tulips’.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The elves were cool, though. They spent a lot of time in forests and were clearly too deep in the game for the dwarves to understand, which is how you might feel listening to Thibodeau begin the album with a line like, “Backing Blackrock dirt and other derring-do”. That’s from “Ejecta,” the album’s heaviest song (blame it on the pump organ), which opens up with the ease of a slow river. It gives way to comparatively lighter fare like the renaissance fair jaunt of “Mercury Dime” and the airy, delicately plucked fantasy of “Ilsa Drown”, which gets an assist from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank""> </a>singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28494-jonsi/"" target=""_blank"">J</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28494-jonsi/"" target=""_blank"">ó</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28494-jonsi/"" target=""_blank"">nsi</a> (who helped record in Reykjavik). The stakes get increasingly higher: Thibodeau isn’t only looking at what’s in front of him, but imagining what’s up and beyond out of reach. “Velvet Antlers” adopts the form of a drum circle to pay tribute to the real or imagined power of the constellations; “We Agreed” uses the great openness of nature as a metaphor for the impossibility of knowing what comes next. (“We agreed that life keeps on going/ A reach we’ll never be knowing”). </span></p>
<p><span>Such ambitious subject material could easily be mishandled by someone more precious or novel in his dedication to this aesthetic. But Thibodeau’s ear for richly pastoral arrangements and Chaucerian lyricism make him more than a high-voiced novelty—he’s a knight or a bard in search of truth, heading along the path through places overgrown with life. This is passionate music, delivered with searing honesty by a man who didn’t mind disappearing from the conversation if that’s what it took to articulate what he was trying to say. The hymnal refrain of the final song, “Loom,” also ends up being the album’s final line: “I don’t want to owe you my only open road to goodbye”. Why bottle yourself in when there’s so much to explore? He sounds sad as he’s singing it, like someone who wishes it was easier to merge his world with ours. For now, it's enough to be shown around. </span></p></div>"|19053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19053-death-vessel-island-intervals/|7.5|Jeremy Gordon

As a group, pensive Compton good guy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, gang-affiliated L.A. street rap classicist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30639-jay-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Rock</a>, suburban psychotropic-loving conspiracy theorist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30353-ab-soul/"" target=""_blank"">Ab-Soul</a> and drug dealing party animal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q/"" target=""_blank"">Schoolboy Q</a> unite to offer a panoramic view of Southern Californian inner city rot. In-house production teams Digi+Phonics and THC buoy the rhymes in excitingly quirky sonics, while gifted recording engineer Mixed By Ali keeps it all sounding winningly crisp and plush. The team has crafted over half a dozen albums together in just four years, and at this juncture, you can almost tell ahead of time what you’re going to get coming into a new TDE project. Although Kendrick’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i></a> revealed a Dickensian eye for storytelling and a knack for radio-savvy singles that didn’t wander too far off the plot—and sold a million copies in the process—the mechanics of his sound didn’t change much. You could easily slide “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” somewhere into Q’s <i>Habits and Contradictions</i> or Soul’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16784-control-system/"" target=""_blank""><i>Control System</i></a> without a bumpy transition. Consistency breeds familiarity, but as Schoolboy Q releases his Interscope debut <i>Oxymoron</i>, the precarious followup to his brother-in-arms’ mainstream windfall, the axiom sometimes proves a liability.</p>
<p>Schoolboy Q specializes in hairpin turns from cautionary street tales and remorseful reflection into wanton bacchanal, and <i>Oxymoron</i> is essentially a volleyball match between his warring proclivities. Opener “Gangsta” kicks off with Q coldly admonishing a street worker for thinking pneumonia gets her the day off, but after the raucous set-repping “Los Awesome”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15613-collard-greens-ft-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">“Collard Greens”</a> drags us to the club for elite liver putrefaction. Then it’s back to the block for a few until “Studio” pops up pining for affection after a stressful day of recording. <i>Oxymoron</i> punctuates its seriousness of purpose with stress-free jingles, like a rap game <i>The Who Sell Out</i>, but it skirts falling apart because Q has cut a figure that seems equally at home throwing back shots and bagging up rocks. His skill set is varied enough to sell a terse, hypnotic vamp like “Collard Greens” off of personality alone, effect a snarling menace bouncing crack dealer bromides off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a> on “What They Want”, and then methodically juggle cadences and syllables relating the story of an uncle’s drug-addled downfall on “Hoover Street”. Q’s wildman delivery does most of the heavy lifting on the slighter material here, but you see the true depth of his songwriting talents in detail obsessed verses on “Break the Bank”, where he lets slip where the pills were stashed back when he sold, and “Prescription/Oxymoron” where Q, holed up at home munching prescription pills, catalogs all the calls he ignores as he hurtles toward an overdose (“My phone rang, rang and rang and rang/ If you ain’t sellin’ drugs, then I don’t hear a thing”). Thing is, these crack storytelling twists are occasionally drowned in formalist gangsta rap boilerplate.</p>
<p><i>Oxymoron</i> is painfully aware of its place in the pantheon of hardcore West Coast rap, from the guest list, which calls in vets like slick-tongued Oakland pimp Suga Free and Dogg Pound wordsmith Kurupt alongside Odd Future magnate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a>, New York mafioso rap architect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"" target=""_blank"">Raekwon</a> and Atlanta trap court jester 2 Chainz to accentuate the commonalities between two generations of drug trafficking goon rap, to its struggle to imbue druggy levity and horned-up bedroom dispatches with a hardened, streetwise edge. Q is never less than engaging in this juggling act (though the brattier numbers can grate, like “Los Awesome”, which sounds like mid-2000s T.I. getting his hands on some quality speed), but he can come off sounding more interested in ticking off his wiseguy bona fides than introducing the person underneath. His 2012 independent album <i>Habits and Contradictions</i> made a much better go of it, from “My Homie”’s wounded story of a friend who turned out to be an embedded undercover cop to “My Hatin’ Joint”, which pulled off the song-for-the-ladies trope with a comically petty air of vindictiveness, to “Oxy Music”, which blueprints <i>Oxymoron</i>’s drug using drug dealer conceit with much more gripping imagery. <i>Oxymoron</i> is gruff and goofy in all the right places, and enticingly lush as one could expect from a TDE project (for instance: the pogoing drums and plinking keys of “Collard Greens”, the perpetually melting synth Tyler suspends over Q and Kurupt on “The Purge”, Pharrell’s keys on “Los Awesome”, equal parts EDM debauchery and arcade overdrive). But a whiff of formula makes for an experience that coolly whisks along on rails where it should be bounding off them.</p>
<p>Q shines the most when he’s able to reconcile his hustler past with his rap star present rather than mining each separately. “Hell of a Night” showcases a trap-house hybrid from DJ Dahi, fresh off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>’s “Worst Behaviour”, and Q cuts loose, partying hard because he’s lived hard enough to deserve it (“I ain’t minding if the world stops/ We been living up in hell’s shop”). “Break the Bank” and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"" target=""_blank"">Chromatics</a>-sampling “Man of the Year” follow suit in affixing the happy ending to <i>Oxymoron</i>’s war stories while serving up the album’s most memorable hooks. The quality that sold the gangsta rap classics Q clearly studied in the process of making this album was an ability to tease triumph out of the mouth of adversity, and <i>Oxymoron</i> really takes off when the streak of songs that close the album proper stumbles onto the equation. Small wonder that the majority of its singles are culled from there.</p>
<p><i>Oxymoron</i> is a victory in that Q’s sound has made the jump to the majors fully intact in an era where major label debuts often take a chop shop approach to assembly. Interscope’s trust in TDE saves the album from the awkward test tube collaborations that bog down many of its peers, but <i>Oxymoron</i>’s doubling down on a reliable formula makes for a relatively risk-averse listen. We don’t find out much about Q’s character or capabilities that we didn’t already know coming in, and a few of the tried and true song tropes here deliver diminishing returns. There isn’t a bad song in the bunch, but you get the sense that three albums in, Q’s readymade sense of what a Schoolboy Q album should sound like is as much a safety net prohibiting outright failure as it is a hindrance to true progression.</p></div>"|19043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19043-schoolboy-q-oxymoron/|7.8|Craig Jenkins

And they’re all secondary to two crucial, non-verbal moments that are nowhere to be found on the lyric sheet. H</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 23.999998092651367px;"">eraldic horns pipe up over</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> a waltz of cyclic, clean guitars and sustained electric organ, right before Holden sings to a friend on the ledge, “Just remember when you’d call me to come/ take a deep breath and then jump.” And the rest of the band punctuates it with a perverse, celebratory “whoa-oh-oh!” This brief moment of release dies down and after three and a half minutes of Holden twisting the same melody until it’s about to snap, his last words are “the pills that you gave didn’t do anything/ I just slept for years on end” and then he gasps. What comes next is the agony of defeat, and the full-band crash is inevitable and knee-buckling every time. For the final minute, Holden is inconsolable in his failure, barely intelligible as he yells “grab a hold/ I know I said to not/ but what the fuck do I know?” and seconds later, the track cuts out abruptly. The name of this song is “An Introduction to the Album”, and is it fucking ever.</span></p>
<p><i>Home, Like NoPlace Is There</i> burns with the same five-alarm intensity throughout its nine songs, and the few times where the Worcester band are at a loss for words, they have no trouble expressing themselves. There isn’t a single moment of passive listening here because the relationships that fill Holden’s songs require 24/7-surveillance; they’re toxic and codependent, with people who “try to make chaos external” and are “killing the self to protect it from harm.” If there isn’t an emergency intervention or a 3AM phone call that must be answered, a funeral is likely to follow. The specifics are removed, but there are lockdowns, pills, fleeting glimmers of hope, broken promises, and people who are just plain fucked to give you an idea of what’s at stake.</p>
<p>This all makes for common subject matter in rock music, especially within the Hotelier’s emotive punk rock. <i>Home</i> derives its gut-wrenching power from Holden’s narrator being someone who’s barely escaped the same tragedies, speaks the language of its victims, and is pulled between knowing that his friends and family may be beyond help and the moral and spiritual drive to be the better man. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16447-the-scope-of-all-of-this-rebuilding/"">“The Scope of All of This Rebuilding”</a>, kinship and resentment are inseparable as Holden spits over barbed, clashing guitars, “you cut your ropes, left the umbilical.” Not caring and caring too much hurt equally, and these songs ache with guilt and real remorse. During “Your Deep Rest”, Holden can’t bring himself to attend the subject’s funeral; in the first chorus he’s merely uncomfortable, the second time around, “the sight of your family made me feel responsible.”</p>
<p>And yet, if you ignore the lyrics, “Your Deep Rest” is a shambling, shuffling piece of soaring pop-rock that could sneak onto any Clear Channel playlist. <i>Home, Like NoPlace Is There</i> is emotionally relentless, but a relentlessly catchy record as well. Holden’s voice holds true to emo’s standards—passionate enough to aspire to the high notes, lacking the training and polish to hit them—though it’s malleable enough to fit within just about every variant of punk that’s gone overground. You get rousing group chants, call-and-response hooks, and collegiate jangle sliced and diced with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi"">Fugazi</a>’s precision (“The Scope of All of This Rebuilding”) and an abrupt turn towards double-time, folkish punk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5361-against-me"">Against Me!</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4562-the-weakerthans"">the Weakerthans</a> (“In Framing”), and that's just within five minutes.</p>
<p>For all of its song-by-song diversity, <i>Home, Like NoPlace Is There</i> is constructed as a whole to mirror the endless cycle of abuse and relapse—a key lyric from “In Framing” puts it it right out there, “you retraced the same shape/ cut up and resewn/ when you felt abandoned, when you felt alone.” It’s not a narrative, though each stylistic shift can serve as a plot twist. Holden manages some sense of composure during the stately first half of “An Introduction to the Album” and “In Framing”, and loses it during “The Scope of All of This Rebuilding” and the impulsively raging “Life In Drag”. The most desperate choruses are the most anthemic, as on near power-ballads “Discomfort Revisited’ and “Among the Wildflowers”, Holden recognizes what his suffering friends never do: the futility of trying to get through this alone.</p>
<p>Theatrical closer “Dendron” takes its title from the Greek word for “tree” and ties back to the arboreal imagery of “Your Deep Rest” as well as its chorus with a gut-wrenching admission (“part of your charm is the way you would push me from/ all of the traps that I just couldn’t see/ figures the one that would trip you up/ would be the one that was set there by me”). <i>Home</i> ends with a transposed version of the melody from “An Introduction to the Album”, and it’s a brief respite, not a happy ending or even an ending. It just puts you right back where you started, prepared to fight another day.</p>
<p><i>Home, Like NoPlace Is There</i> is very much an album that works its ass off; it can’t afford to do otherwise, as the Hotelier battle addiction, ignorance, and their own past. The first line finds a flock of singing birds telling Holden to “tear the buildings down,” perhaps referring to their auspicious debut as the Hotel Year, which was beset by scene politics and industry bullshit to the point where they’re <a href=""http://homelikenoplaceisthere.tumblr.com/post/70171251415/tomorrow-is-going-to-be-a-very-exciting-day-for"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing it out of their history</a> to an extent. And the Hotelier are fighting against the real possibility of this record failing to reach its intended audience. Towards the end of that missive, Holden shrugs at being “<a href=""http://homelikenoplaceisthere.tumblr.com/post/70171251415/tomorrow-is-going-to-be-a-very-exciting-day-for"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">emo now</a>,"" knowing that word could scare away self-identifying indie rock and punk fans even though this is where you’ll find nearly all of the passionate, lyrical and hooky guitar bands on independent labels with personality, basement-show ethics and big-tent ambitions these days.</p>
<p>But sonically, politically, and ethically, the Hotelier are punk as fuck and perhaps in turn, <i>Home, Like NoPlace There Is</i> can occasionally sound more exciting and unstable than “masterful.” There are slip-ups—“Housebroken” is overwrought with metaphor, and there are times when the muddy production can’t quite support their arrangements—but ones that let you know they’re only beginning to realize what they’re capable of. So this might be the sound of the Hotelier tearing the building down, but they’re working towards something monumental.</p></div>"|18963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18963-the-hotelier-home-like-noplace-is-there/|8.2|Ian Cohen

At once hypnotic, triumphant, and bittersweet, it's something like Kompakt star <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a> gone piano-house, with dance-diva vocals reaching heavenward and then disintegrating as if you were listening to it on a tape player with a battery that's giving up the ghost. Nothing else on the album is quite like this, and certainly nothing is as immediate.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The rest of </span><i>Three Love Songs</i><span> is pop-ambient in more of a lower-case sense, and that works, too. Ricky Eat Acid is Sam Ray, a Maryland-based musician who has his hand in a few other projects and was booked to open a late-February New York City show by R&amp;B aesthetes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"" target=""_blank"">Rhye</a>; wonderfully (and tellingly), a recent mix Ray made for </span><a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/01/07/fader-mix-ricky-eat-acid-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>The Fader</span></a><span> consists mostly of scruffy, heart-on-sleeve indie guitar pop from bands like Go Sailor, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31621-joanna-gruesome/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Gruesome</a>, and Rocketship. Though it takes this album until the eighth of 12 songs to reach its dying-real pinnacle—the LP title is a </span><i>slight </i><span>misnomer—how it gets there is a patient journey across nuanced, digital-meets-organic soundscapes, fraught with gnawing heartache and wistful reminiscence. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Three Love Songs</i> is Ricky Eat Acid's first album available on vinyl, and the first vinyl release from Brooklyn's <a href=""http://orchidtapes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Orchid Tapes</a>. Part of why it's so affecting comes down to an inspired and strategic use of the format. Side one is almost entirely drum-less, but each flickering vignette, heavy with found sounds, is different enough from the last that by the time a preacher starts spewing fire and brimstone on the fifth (and first substantial) track, the seven-minute ""In rural virginia; watching glowing lights crawl from the dark corners of the room"", it's, well—not quite a come-to-Jesus moment, but pretty close. The slightly uncanny piano loops of fuzz-caked mid-album track ""Inside your house; it will swallow us too"" are in their own way almost as catchy as ""In my dreams we're almost touching""; piano carries over to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>-like side-A closer ""It will draw me over to it like it always does"", which finally adds percussion and a sung vocal sample. Not a moment too soon, or too late.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One predecessor for this type of unguardedly emotional, magpie downtempo might be late, great Swedish duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a>'s 2008 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11933-no-way-down-ep/""><i>No Way Down</i> EP</a>. The sonic similarity is clearest on the second of <i>Three Love Songs</i>' two (one for each side) seven-minute opuses, the instrumental ""Outside your house; the lights went out &amp; there was nothing"", with its sumptuous viola next to IDM-bustling beats and opulent keys. But there's a bigger spiritual affinity: The choir-like vocals and shrill hum of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"" target=""_blank"">Yo La Tengo</a>-referencing hymn ""I can hear the heart breaking as one"" would be out of character from the Swedes, but the<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7686-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-200-101/6/""> ""sort of like a dream, no better""</a> quality, that heart-in-throat sense of of being suspended between planes of existence.

Couldn't they at least <i>try</i> to write a song with a chorus?, Bassford wondered. As the freewheeling, compositionally adventurous <i>Ice Level</i> attests—the answer was a resounding no. But Bassford persisted. ""I was like, 'Carlos, don't worry,'"" he recalled <a href=""http://www.thelmagazine.com/TheMeasure/archives/2014/02/14/qanda-ava-luna"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a recent interview</a>. ""'It's still gonna be weird. Having a chorus doesn't make it not weird.'""</p>
<p class=""p1"">After hearing Ava Luna's taut and irresistibly fun new album <i>Electric Balloon</i>, it's hard to disagree. Its 11 songs are as eccentric as anything this band of merry weirdos has ever done, but they stick in your head in a way their earlier material did not. Ava Luna are a kitchen-sink band, whose richly cluttered songs pull from a variety of influences: dance-punk, funk, doo-wop, and R&amp;B. (They've summed it up in a perfectly succinct Bandcamp tag: <a href=""http://bandcamp.com/tag/nervous-soul?artist=3144585128"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""nervous soul.""</a>) They're one of very few current indie bands (in New York or anywhere else) reaching back to the lineage of no-wave; Hernandez often sings in a trembling falsetto but his acrobatic yelps sounds like nobody so much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/722-james-chance/"">James Chance</a>. Because of their punchy and tightly arranged female backing vocals, Ava Luna often get compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a>, but that parallel is more appropriate for the figures at the center of those bands. Like Dave Longstreth, Hernandez is an intelligent, almost-<i>too</i>-ambitious maestro who over time has learned how to embrace playfulness and shine a spotlight around his equally talented ensemble.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ava Luna wrote and recorded <i>Electric Balloon</i> over two different two-week-long working vacations sequestered in a house in upstate New York; every evening, they'd cook, crack jokes, and then channel their energy into nightly after-dinner jam sessions. The result of this process—""more like culling than just writing,"" as Bassford says—is a much looser album than <i>Ice Level</i>, which was carefully arranged to the point of sometimes feeling stiff or aloof. But there's an inclusive, kinetic vibe to the best songs on <i>Electric Balloon</i> (which was produced by Hernandez and drummer Julian Fader), like the spunky shout-along ""Sears Roebuck M&amp;Ms"", or ""Plain Speech"", which morphs halfway through from jittery funk to dazzling AM radio gold. Ava Luna are an exhilarating live band, and <i>Electric Balloon</i> is the first thing they've done that comes close to bottling that energy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Since <i>Ice Level</i>, Ava Luna have shrunk from a seven-piece to a five-piece, and this streamlining has cleared out some (though not all) of the clutter in their sound and benefited the band dynamic. Felicia Douglass (vocals/keyboards) and Becca Kauffman (vocals/guitar) are both more active presences on <i>Electric Balloon</i>—and this is a very good thing. Ava Luna are now a band with not one but three distinct lead singers, each with unique but complementary personalities. Hernandez's songs, like the opener ""Daydream"", are often driven by a frayed, manic intensity. (The ""nervous soul"" tag is definitely most apt when he's at the helm.) It's an enjoyably wild ride, but it might be too much to take were it not balanced out by quieter moments like the ballad ""PRPL"", Douglass's stunning and velvety lead vocal turn.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But, as long as you like your choruses weird, the breakout star of <i>Electric Balloon</i> is Kauffman. She vamps and <i>woooops!</i> through ""Sears Roebuck M&amp;Ms"" like a kid riding a sugar high, and spews mesmerizing gibberish throughout the title track, which channels the brief moment when the B-52s were too strange for the radio. That last song was written most spontaneously of all, when Kauffman stepped up to the mic and started riffing on a vocal idea she had during one of the after-dinner jam sessions. The rest of the band tried to join in but they weren't quite sure what she was saying: ""Shock me with electrical uhh?"" ""Shopping with electric balloon?"" None of the guesses amount to much sense—but damn if that mysterious hook isn't stuck in your head for days. Ava Luna are still speaking in tongues, as they always have been, but this time they're inviting you to sing along.</p></div>"|19061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19061-ava-luna-electric-balloon/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

A vintage-synth freak with a nostalgic moniker diving headlong into the sounds of 1983? In that long, hazy comedown from 2009's summer of chillwave, Haley was practically popping a wheelie on the zeitgeist. He took full advantage, too, offering up the superb <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15085-cyanide-sisters-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cyanide Sisters</i> EP</a> and the almost-as-good <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15604-galactic-melt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Galactic Melt</i> LP</a> in the same calendar year. But, apart from 2012's soggy early-days comp <i>In Decay</i>, we've heard next to nothing from him in the interim. <i>Wave 1</i>, Com Truise's new seven-song EP, is the first in a planned series that, <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/18711/1/com-truise-wave-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as Haley told DazedDigital</a>, concerns ""the world’s first Synthetic Astronaut on this journey to a planet—each release represents the next stage in his journey."" The chrome-plated, pristine <i>Wave 1</i> plants itself at the intersection of synth-funk, electro, and fussy 80s computer-pop. Haley, returning from a two-year absence, seems content to reemerge as a man out of time: unconcerned with the trends of the day, blissfully mining Reagan-era pop at its most meticulous.</p>
<p>Opener ""Wasat"" whirrs to a start like a spaceship preparing for hyperdrive. Just 15 seconds in, and it's all systems go: a punctilious synth stutters like a long-lost Bambaataa track while a couple more streak past in a flash of light. The needly high-register synth and burbling bass at the center of ""Mind"" are almost conversant, trading garbled interstellar transmissions atop the crackling of the drum machine. Haley's fastidious—forever searching for the perfect beat—and even his fizziest synth never seems to trail too far afield. In the past, his exacting approach has occasionally tipped over into rigidity. But on <i>Wave 1</i>, his chosen sonic touchstones—whether it's pre-<i>Purple Rain</i> Prince or<i> Cupid and Psyche</i>-era Scritti Politti—share his fondness for clean lines, sharp edges, and inorganic rhythms. Haley's fussiness persists, but on <i>Wave 1</i>, he comes by it honestly.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Wave 1</i> peaks with ""Declination"", a slick, bright-as-the-sun pop deconstruction with vocals from Ford &amp; Lopatin's Joel Ford. Haley's never quite known what to do with vocals, but Ford's an ideal fit for the otherwise all-instrumental <i>Wave 1</i>, his roboticized falsetto sliding its way into the nooks and crannies of the bustling track, bringing some curious new shades to the all-pastel palette. Haley's never seemed particularly concerned with innovation; as Andrew Gaerig wrote in his review of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16917-in-decay/"" target=""_blank""><i>In Decay</i></a>, he's a ""grid-worshipping…pure stylist,"" more interested in playing within the lines than expanding on them. By injecting a little human warmth into this carefully delineated, fiercely technical music, Ford does as much to push <i>Wave 1</i>'s sound forward as Haley himself.</p>
<p>Apart from the the splattering ""I Would Die 4 U"" drum patterns sitting underneath ""Miserere Mei"", <i>Wave 1</i>'s post-""Declination"" tracks find Haley retreating into the tried-and-true: burbling bass, squelchy zero-gravity synths, blunt-ride rhythms. These songs are sleek and glorious-sounding, each squiggle and thump given its own space. But, by leaving no space for error, Haley also doesn't allow much room for feeling, and after a half an hour of vaccum-sealed rhythms, a skipped beat or a flubbed intro never sounded so right. After a few years of silence, Haley's still a stickler for detail, still more concerned with perfection than innovation, still mixing up ""crisp"" and ""mechanical."" But by burrowing down into a few key sounds rather than stiffly approximating a dozen-plus, the intermittently funky, unshakably finicky <i>Wave 1</i> is a mostly welcome return.</p></div>"|19006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19006-com-truise-wave-1/|6.7|Paul Thompson

On hooking up with <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a> for their first full-length album since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11917-the-devil-you-me/""><i>The Devil, You + Me</i></a> in 2008, the label made such a <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/news/2013/11/15/can_you_guess_who_what_artist_s_we_signed?r=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">big deal</a> that it felt positively un-Notwistian. This is a band that operates without fanfare, favoring the periphery over the spotlight. Even their brightest moment—the elevation in stature following the release of the gorgeous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5845-neon-golden/""><i>Neon Golden</i></a> in 2002—led to more than half a decade of inactivity prior to its follow-up. The Notwist may feel like they know how to disappear completely, but there's a weight of expectation when news of resumed activities comes through, a sense that a return to the bittersweet sentiment of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTc-crmY5Rs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chemicals""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uh8PX6QqAU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pick Up the Phone""</a> could be careering around the bend.</p>
<p>At their peak this is a band that can make disparate feelings feel positively orderly, with singer Markus Acher's approach emotional yet strangely distant, resembling someone trying to open up but keeping a handful of key thoughts to themselves. In theory the Notwist should be a big mess, with nascent thrashings in hardcore circles, attempts at bridging technology and indie-rock long before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"">Thom Yorke</a> tripped over a sampler, and Acher's non-voice floating along on top of it all. Instead, like all bands who've had at least one <i>Neon Golden</i> moment in their careers, they have a way of making it seem remarkably uncomplicated, establishing this as a space they inhabit alone despite the legions of laptop-tapping acts with an ear for pop melody, some of whom seeped deeper into the public consciousness than the Notwist will presumably ever do at this point.</p>
<p>Initially things seemed promising for <i>Close to the Glass</i>. Releasing the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16380-close-to-the-glass/"">title track</a> with its detuned beats underpinned by familiarly fussy electronics and Acher subsumed somewhere in the middle of it all was a smart move, resembling the kind of dubbed-out pop structures Margaret Fielder was practicing with her band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2410-laika/"">Laika</a> circa their excellent <i>Silver Apples of the Moon</i>. Better still was the release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16539-kong/"">""Kong""</a>, which comes stamped through with a forthright guitar clang, irresistible organ drone, and Acher hitting some wavering high notes not dissimilar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">J Mascis</a>' falsetto. It's this album’s equivalent of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyz6MnWFAIg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Day 7""</a> from <i>Shrink</i>—finding the spot where their brainiac approach merges perfectly with their fondness for abandon, resulting in a catchy moment that's a far better realization of their anthemic tendencies than similar efforts from <i>The Devil, You + Me</i>.</p>
<p>There's a sense of confidence installed by placing ""Close to the Glass"" and ""Kong"" early in the tracklisting, although what follows never gets back there. The drop in quality isn't sharp—instead it's like watching a group of people kicking around a ball that's slowly deflating. There's an acoustic campfire misfire (""Casino""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a> wistfulness (""Steppin' In""), an attempt at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4045-kevin-shields/"">Kevin Shields</a>' glide-guitar sound that feels like it was regurgitated from a dusty old rehearsal tape from the mid-90s (""7-Hour-Drive""), and a go-nowhere instrumental that quickly crosses the line from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>-esque beauty to boredom (""Lineri""). It would be a little cruel to hold up the title of ""From One Wrong Place to the Next"" as symbolic of where the second half of <i>Close to the Glass</i> ends up; instead, there is no sense of place at all, just a series of loose strands that never reach a point of cohesion.</p>
<p>A version of <i>Shrink</i> was released on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>'s <a href=""http://www.duophonic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Duophonic</a> label when it initially surfaced, and it's easy to trace links between the approach and trajectory of both bands—both fascinated by the meeting point between pop and technology, both keen to maintain an emotional distance from their audience, both quietly working away with little regard for reception. Arguably Stereolab's later career produced more uneven results than their earlier work, and it feels like the Notwist are in that phase now, where change comes off as forced and unnecessary, and the bigger picture of the band's identity becomes increasingly cloudy. There was always a tendency to divert into different styles on their prior albums (at least from <i>12</i> onward), but always with a feel of continuity underpinning it all, as if each path they took was firmly routing off the same road. Here, their razor-sharp sense of direction feels strangely blunted.</p></div>"|19054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19054-the-notwist-close-to-the-glass/|6.4|Nick Neyland

He released his first single in 1994 and helmed a renaissance of that scene alongside peers like Rick Wilhite, Marcellus Pittman and Theo Parrish (the four intermittently collaborate as 3 Chairs). Since the 90s, no two producers have better exported that “Detroit” sound than Theo Parrish and Moodymann. In citing that bankrupted American city though, one means a very specific sound, one that writer Michaelangelo Matos recently described in <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/bestmusic2013/2013/12/31/258701743/defining-detroit-techno-the-retrospectives-and-reissues-of-2013"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an NPR story</a> as “a byword for high-minded purism, a bulwark against ‘commercial’ dance music,” the music itself informed by “jazz chords, R&amp;B melancholy, snatches of old soul and plenty of cosmic-mindedness.”</p>
<p>All four genres abound in Moodymann’s work, and his self-titled newest album also throws in plenty of gospel, blues, house music, roller-rink funk, all of it capped by a long slow nod in the direction of forbearers Parliament-Funkadelic. There’s a purism to Moody’s music, but it’s made of muddy waters (literally, on “Sunday Hotel”), dusty vinyl grooves and—if the Popeye's inner sleeve is to believed—greasy fingers. Playful in juxtaposition to Theo’s seriousness, the Dizzy Gillespie to Theo's Miles Davis, Dixon might be best glimpsed through the prism of another Detroiter: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a>. Both men deconstructed and flipped old funk and soul to new ends, Dilla’s focus towards hip-hop, Moodymann's towards basement-deep house music.</p>
<p>Take an album highlight like “Desire"", which features Moodymann with uncredited Blue Note crooner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28662-jose-james/"" target=""_blank"">José James</a>. James does his deepest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28552-gil-scott-heron/"" target=""_blank"">Gil Scott-Heron</a> impersonation, Moody deploys piano chords as judiciously as Bill Evans did, all of it set against a beat that edges towards house only to dissipate just before settling into a steady pace. Old 33 1/3 soul gets spun at 45 on the ecstatic “Lyk U Use 2"", the skittering snare pattern of fellow Detroiter Andrés then slowed all the way down to 45 BPM. It’s not only old soul vocals though: there’s an acid squirt over the Junior Boys’ Jeremy Greenspan on “IGuessuneverbeenlonely” and most peculiar of all, has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a> ask about death on “Born 2 Die"". </p>
<p>But the most prominent voice on the album is Dixon’s own. In a close-mic’d croak, Moodymann’s vocal delivery vacillates between late-night disc jockey and booty call from Sly Stone. He laments that “eight and a half is not enuff anymore,” that girls may not like 45s. One of the funniest call-and-responses of the year occurs on the too-brief “No”; KDJ heavy-breathes from a payphone to one of those bikini-clad nymphets draped across him on the front cover, asks if she likes fried chicken without hot sauce. Also: “Y’all mad I’m a local Detroiter?”</p>
<p>While almost every second of Moodymann’s oeuvre hearkens back to his hometown, <i>Moodymann</i> is perhaps his most explicit ode yet. Snippets of movie dialogue, murder statistics and tales of 70s heroin kingpins like Henry Marzette emerge between the spacious, slack grooves. For all the insouciance that’s informed Moodymann’s work over the past two decades, <i>Moodymann</i> feels downright serious at times. It comes to the fore on the sprawling twelve-minute version of Funkadelic’s “Cosmic Slop"", which is part cover, part edit, part deconstruction, part remix. Yet for a reason not altogether clear amid its haze is that these parts just don’t quite add up. Blame the news report samples or perhaps Dixon’s own croon, but midway through, I fantasized what a sidelong KDJ edit circa 1998 might’ve sounded like instead.</p></div>"|19037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19037-moodyman-moodymann/|7.8|Andy Beta

Still stinging from the acrimonious breakup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü </a>in 1988, the singer/guitarist formed a new trio to replace the old, this one with bassist Tony Maimone and drummer Anton Fier (who, among other accomplishments, served together briefly in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3284-pere-ubu/"" target=""_blank"">Pere Ubu</a>). That caliber of rhythm section had the potential to be at least as loud as Hüsker Dü’s. Instead, Mould turned down and turn his back on punk. “I sensed there was a part of the punk audience that would feel betrayed,” Mould writes unapologetically in his autobiography <i>See a Little Light</i>, “but it was important to move beyond the sound of the past eight years.” At the time, Mould was living in rural Minnesota, not far from an Amish settlement. <i>Workbook</i> isn’t exactly a work of entrenched technophobia—come the new millennium, Mould would even go so far as to dabble in electronica—but its hushed tone and introspective air reflects a sense of isolation that’s bucolic if not exactly idyllic.</p>
<p>Mould was an angry young man in Hüsker Dü, and anger abounds on <i>Workbook </i>(which is getting an expanded reissue in honor of its 25th anniversary, <i>Workbook 25</i>). Here, though, it’s dispersed among empty spaces and meandering melodies. There’s a honeycombed hollowness to tracks like “Heartbreak a Stranger” and “Sinners and Their Repentances"", both of them overlaid with languid jangle and Mould’s newly naked moan. After years of straining to be heard over Hüsker’s din, he sounds almost startled by the potency and range of his own voice; the same goes for the themes of his lyrics, which don’t shy away from an encroaching spirituality that would eventuality lead to Mould’s religious awakening years later. But for every folky, free-flowing rumination is a song such as “Dreaming, I Am"", which veers between a driving beat, delicate guitar, and a deceptively corrosive mood.</p>
<p>“See a Little Light,” the song after which Mould named his book, was <i>Workbook</i>’s lead single. Accordingly, it’s the album’s brimming cup of pop hooks. Still, it’s far more drifting and complex than it seems at first, pivoting around tangles of chords while gliding frictionlessly across the glassy playing of cellist Jane Scarpantoni (who’d appeared on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a>’s <i>Green</i> and would go on to play with everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Springsteen</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>). The widespread use of cello throughout <i>Workbook</i> is one of its more striking tonal choices; Mould originally wrote those parts for synthesizer, and their translation into chamber instrument threads the album with a haunting, melancholy warmth—especially on “Sinners"", where Scarpantoni duels with Mould like a demonic temptation.</p>
<p>Hüsker Dü was, in many ways, a massively distorted folk band—but <i>Workbook </i>isn’t just acoustic Mould like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoxflJFTgl4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Too Far Down”</a>, <i>Candy Apple Grey</i> with the gunk scraped off. “Brasilia Crossed with Trenton”, which Mould says came to him one morning as a “full realized dreamsong,"" is seven minutes of imagistic, shanty-like folk-rock, but it’s hard to imagine its soul-spilling excess and sprawl ever fitting onto a Hüsker album, even one as ambitious as <i>Zen Arcade</i>. The problem is, Mould takes catharsis to a new dimension on <i>Workbook</i>, but that leaves subtle cuts like “Brasilia” and “Lonely Afternoon” undefended by Mould’s most formidable weapon: a walloping chorus. He still wields them on “See a Little Light”—which boasts one of most searing choruses of his career—as well as on “Poison Years”, which crams tender twang, roiling angst, anthemic stamina, and squealing showmanship into a single song. All the elements of Mould’s songwriting are on parade on “Poison Years”, but they’re lumped together in odd, lopsided combinations.</p>
<p>“Poison Years” also shows that Mould wasn’t entirely ready to strum gentle into that good night. Along with <i>Workbook</i>’s darkest track, the venom-dripping “Wishing Well”, it vengefully kicks on the distortion pedal as if it were an old toy that triggered memories of a troubled childhood. The shift is more than simply sonic, as Mould himself seems equally electrified when he lets his amps to scream. One of the bonus tracks of <i>Workbook 25</i> is the bouncy, catchy “All Those People Know,” the B-side of the “See a Little Light Single”—and it makes perfect sense that it was omitted from the original album release, seeing as how it could easily pass for latter-day Hüsker Dü.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Workbook 25</i>’s bonus tracks comprise a live set recorded at the Metro in Chicago in 1989. The live version of “Sunspots” is echoing and effected, sounding in that regard almost like a John Martyn song. Mould’s affinity for vintage English folk-rock is also evident in his faithful yet fiery rendition of Richard and Linda Thompson’s “Shoot Out the Lights.” (He would eventually record Richard Thompson’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMx0QRBClQQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Turning of the Tide”</a> for the 1994 tribute album <i>Beat the Retreat</i>). But it’s “If You’re True” that’s the hidden gem of <i>Workbook 25</i>. A song that Mould has admitted to being a swipe at his former Hüsker Dü bandmates Grant Hart and Greg Norton—“No more friends that lie and hide / No more games to play to get to know the answer,” he rages—the Metro version of “If You’re True” is unleashed with riotous righteousness plus a clutch of country-rock licks that come together to sound uncannily like the formula Uncle Tupelo was about to make famous. It’s far more spirited than the drum-machine-backed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAP_RPwYZn4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1988 demo version</a>, but Mould’s grudges didn’t fully carry over to his previous group’s music. He opens those fresh wounds long to encore with three Hüsker Dü songs: “Hardly Getting Over It”, “Celebrated Summer”, and “Makes No Sense at All”. As Mould states in <i>See a Little Light</i>, when <i>Workbook</i> came out “there was a concerted effort not only to divorce myself from my past, but also not to live off of my past accomplishments”. Yet he performs his Hüsker set reverently, intimately, almost in awe of the life they’ve taken on.</p>
<p>While Mould seems liberated by his newfound quietude, he also strains at it. In the video for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDnNr6lNxvc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“See a Little Light”</a> he thrashes and hammers at his strings; at one point, spit flies from his lips. It’s as though he alone can hear the noise behind his clean-toned, cello-swaddled songs, that theoretical roar that his old group would have brought to them. The pent-up force finally breaks free on <i>Workbook</i>’s final track, “Whichever Way the Wind Blows"", a lurching, churning, borderline grungy rager full of haywire guitar and Mould’s most unhinged vocal performance since his SST days. Sure enough, Mould, Maimone, and Fier would quickly crank themselves up to paint-peeling levels on<i> Black Sheets of Rain</i>, their 1990 follow-up to <i>Workbook</i>; from there, Mould’s 90s group Sugar would return Mould triumphantly to his punchy, distorted roots. But the urgency and vigor he packs into the unplugged punk of <i>Workbook</i>—the frequent knuckle-scraping attack of his strumming, his refusal to whisper or withhold—are what make the album a testament to tension rather than hesitance.</p></div>"|19051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19051-bob-mould-workbook-25/|8.0|Jason Heller

Coincidentally enough, just days later, New York quartet <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/skatersnyc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skaters</a> issued their own listicle of Big Apple rock-history signifiers—they just happened to do it in the form of their debut record. </p>
<p>It’s an album about living in Manhattan titled <i>Manhattan</i>. There’s a song about what it’s like to be young in NYC called “To Be Young in NYC”. There are between-song snippets of young women complaining about sublets in uncannily <a href=""http://girls.wikia.com/wiki/Shoshanna_Shapiro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shosh</a>-like voices. And it's no exaggeration to say this album—and its major-label patronage—would not exist without the modernized grot-rock of the Strokes’ <i>Is This It</i>. But in contrast to that unimpeachable document of pre-9/11, Giuliani-era jollies, <i>Manhattan</i> is the rock‘n’roll analogue to a post-Bloomberg New York, where skyrocketing rents—and the big-box chains that can afford them—can make some city blocks look like Anytown USA. If the Strokes savvily refashioned NYC iconoclasts like the Velvet Underground and Television as dance-party pop music, <i>Manhattan</i> is what’s become of your head-shop CBGB t-shirt after another 12 years of laundromat visits.</p>
<p>Each of the 11 songs here are positioned at some point in an endless cycle of going out, scoping girls, getting drunk, making out, passing out, and “waking up in [your] clothes.” But for Skaters, such scenes are apparently so routine that they often sound disinterested in their own debauchery: On the opening track, “One of Us”, frontman Michael Ian Cummings sums up another messy night on the town by blithely repeating the words “fun and games” with an audible shrug that suggests he’d rather be at home catching up on <i>House of Cards</i>. It’s a blasé attitude that’s reflected in the band’s intensely streamlined sound, which retains the fuzz and buzz of post-millennial mainstream garage-rock, but is synth-smoothed and rhythmically processed to the point of sterlity. And the dabbles with electro blips (“I Wanna Dance But I Don't Know How”) and half-baked hardcore (“Nice Hat”) ultimately dilute rather than diversify the band’s personality; you’ll hear more credible reggae than “Bandbreaker” in your local karaoke bar’s backing track for “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvuVFHTvdaY&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Underneath It All</a>.”</p>
<p>But if Skaters' version of Manhattan feels overly insular and one-dimensional, they at least come by it honestly: Upon arriving from L.A. in 2012, Cummings reportedly spent his first year in New York working as a bartender, giving him a nightly front-row seat to a parade of self-indulgence. And in his more inspired moments, he evinces the smarm and charm (if not the knockout lyricism) of another guy who's seen his fair share of last calls, Paul Westerberg. Really, if the reunited Replacements decided to make a new record in 2014, they could do worse than crank out new-waved power-pop pick-me-ups like “Schemers” or the aforementioned “To Be Young in NYC”, whose shout-out to “a generation of jerks, directionless on our feet” scans as a post-millennial update of “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl9KQ1Mub6Q&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bastards of Young</a>.”</p>
<p>However, it's the song dedicated to an unattainable rival-state beauty that, ironically, best fulfills <i>Manhattan</i>’s soundtrack-to-the-city mission: “Miss Teen Massachusetts”, which boasts the album's most towering hook and convincingly restless performance. It just goes to show that it takes a lot more to capture the spirit of New York City in song than sampling conversations with cab drivers or rhyming “Harlem” with “problem”; with its churning groove and pleading, stressed-out vocal, “Miss Teen Massachusetts” counts as the rare moment where Skaters seem less concerned about describing what life in Manhattan looks and sounds like, and more into communicating how it really feels.</p></div>"|19023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19023-skaters-manhattan/|4.8|Stuart Berman

In the 80s, he tumbled found sounds into industrial onslaughts. In the 1990s and through much of the last decade, his duo Pan Sonic worked as a sort of analogue revolver, pushing between noise-heavy flotsam and graceful, glitchy techno. Vainio follows that same swerving muse by himself; in the past two years, he’s released a record that crunches and grinds (<a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Mika-Vainio-Kilo/master/574751"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Kilo</i></a>), one that sparkles only to roar (<a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Mika-Vainio-Fe%E2%82%83O%E2%82%84-Magnetite/release/3744051"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Magnetite</i></a>), and another that hovers in a beautifully somber reverie (the impressive new <i>Konstellaatio</i>). What’s more, in an age of composers and improvisers staring at MacBook screens both onstage and in the studio, Vainio sticks to his longtime hardware kit of sequencers and synthesizers, effects pedals, and manipulated instruments. Speaking of computers, <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/11167-mika-vainio-interview-pan-sonic-kilo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he flatly told the Quietus last year</a>, “I have no problem resisting that.”</p>
<p>But <i>Konstellaatio</i>, Vainio’s first full-length in three years under his occasional mononym Ø, shares several sonic and stylistic traits with the slow wave of doom-oriented electronic musicians that have grown out of darkwave, shoegaze and heavy metal in recent years. Across these nine tracks, Vainio juxtaposes blanketing drones with airy keyboards, clipped beats and beeps with seemingly bottomless bass. These slow-motion spans treat the beautiful and the threatening as necessary complements, as though he were a horror film director with an eye for both shock and cinematic elegance. For its overall aggression and bulk, Vainio’s back catalogue can be intimidating, even off-putting. But <i>Konstellaatio</i> is luminous and eerie, the sort of liminal record where the pretty sounds elicit goose bumps and the grimmest tones feel like exhalations. Likely by little conscious design, Vainio is the stylistic contemporary of acts such as Demdike Stare, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"" target=""_blank"">Haxan Cloak</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Stott</a>, at least temporarily. If there’s a movement among such groups, <i>Konstellaatio </i>merits more than mention with it.</p>
<p>Vainio works with a rather limited set of sounds on <i>Konstellaatio</i>, but he groups them into unexpected sets. He cycles constantly through low, high, and mid-range tones, a strategy he sets in motion during the thesis-like opener “Otava”. Mellifluous keyboards lay like a lacy filigree atop bulbous bass, with quick, shivering clicks teasing a rhythm between them. “Neutronit” could rattle trunks, with powerful concussions pounding beneath chirping circuits. But Vainio steadily corrodes his own system by fostering a rising tide of distortion beneath the beat. He’s the puppeteer, balancing the thrills of propulsion with the threat of darkness. The revelatory closer “Takaisin” works in much the same manner, pitting a corroded, dub-like skitter and whorls of sampled mbira melodies against foreboding bass movements. <i>Konstellaatio </i>works best when Vainio makes each piece’s elements conspire against one another, as when twinkling bells trickle their quiet hymns across the tectonic motion of “Elämän Puu” or when an unlikely rhythm emerges from a call-and-response between seraphic keyboards and hellish distortion during “Metsän Sydän”. These juxtapositions offer brief glimpses into Vainio’s past, itself a springboard to contrast.</p>
<p>If scope and restlessness are Vainio’s assets, overall editing isn’t. Judicious, non-grandiose projects have never really fit his approach. He releases a lot of records, and he tends to overload them with material. (His last four albums run collectively for more than four hours.) Sähkö, the label that Vainio co-founded in the 90s and has since issued much of his own music, released <i>Konstellaatio</i> on CD. Listening to it, though, it’s hard not to wish that Vainio didn’t find some way to make this fit onto one slab of vinyl. Though some of <i>Konstellaatio</i>’s best moments arrive near the end, these 66 minutes start to feel a touch oppressive long before the hour mark ticks near. As it floats from crackling static into sunwarped melody, from drifting guitar into coruscant glockenspiel, the 10-minute “Talvipäivä, Vanha Motelli” begins to feel like the record’s musical sketchpad, an organizational vestige accidentally left behind. And no matter how broad and compelling their sounds become, no matter how monstrous the bass or florid the high tones, the paired openers linger like redundant introductions. <i>Konstellaatio</i> fills a lot of room, then, with very little range. But what’s there is excellent and, for Vainio, a striking and surprising contribution to a scene that’s watched him work for at least two decades. </p></div>"|19032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19032-artist-konstellaatio/|7.4|Grayson Haver Currin

Much has been made about how Wild Beasts have drastically reduced the musical drama since their swashbuckling, chandelier-swinging debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12450-limbo-panto/"">Limbo, Panto</a>.</i> <i>Present Tense </i>doesn’t reverse that trend, but without much left to discard sonically, Wild Beasts make their most radical and daring subtraction: <i>emotional</i> drama.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As unique as they’ve been musically, Wild Beasts' candid carnality has made them far more rare in the boy’s club of rock music than you’d been led to believe. Uncoupling masculinity from cartoon machismo, indie slackerdom, teenage neediness, and brooding distance, Wild Beasts presented modern man as a libidinous creature burdened by expectations and failed by his body, both hunter-aggressor and prey to their own insecurities and embarrassments. Thorpe sang “I know I'm not any kind of heart-throb/ But at the same time, I'm not any sort of slob” on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15436-smother/""><span class=""s1""><i>Smother</i></span></a>’s “Plaything” and that was about the size of it. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Things are a lot healthier on <i>Present Tense</i>, and Wild Beasts' dueling vocalists own up to past mistakes. Thorpe sums it up on “Past Perfect”: “Man did fuck up/ And then he learnt.” Lurid and obscenely limber, “Mecca” presents sexual compatibility as nothing short of god’s will and eternal truth. The same goes for the “Sweet Spot”, its title signifying “A godly state/ Where the real and the dream may consummate.” You’ve got the gist of it by the time “A Simple Beautiful Truth” comes around, and it’s Wild Beasts’ most locked-in, fluid performance, barely two minutes of gorgeous and curvaceous R&amp;B. These add ballast to the plainspoken and plainly pretty pop songs that define Wild Beasts’ new romantic fulfillment. “Palace” and “Pregnant Pause” come awfully close to treacle outside of context, but balanced by the loinclothed swagger of “Nature Boy” and the apocalyptic retribution that “Daughters” foretells, contentment feels earned rather than seen as entitlement.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Present Tense </i>is incrementally more dense and foreboding than <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15436-smother/"">Smother</a></i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13382-two-dancers/"">Two Dancers</a></i>. This is largely due to the implementation of synthesizers, arranged by Leo Abrahams (amongst other things, co-writer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24567-david-byrne-brian-eno"">David Byrne and Brian Eno</a>’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DQyusKTAh4&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Strange Overtones”</a>) and Lexxx, whose previous, blunt-force stadium-status charges (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire"">Arcade Fire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers"">the Killers</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna"">Madonna</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2370-keane"">Keane</a> amongst them) are about the exact opposite of Wild Beasts. And yet, even with all of this expert musicianship and hired talent, the added sounds are soft and welcoming. The lo-fi, rigid beats of “Wanderlust” and “Daughters” and the <i>Hounds of Love</i>-style Linn rolls that ramp up the chorus of “Mecca” push against Chris Talbot, a drummer who’s never played a standard rock beat and still hasn’t; he’s at his most emotive on <i>Present Tense</i>, as “Nature Boy” skulks with primitive menace, while the sadness of “A Dog’s Life” is conveyed by an inventive trick that makes his kit sound like it’s deflating.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Though dealt with indirectly, class struggle has always pervaded Wild Beasts' lyrics and they’ve always empathized with the outsider for good reason. They came on the scene at a time when the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys"">Arctic Monkeys</a> ensured that lad-rock would continue to constitute the UK’s musical ruling class, and so their early, theatrical scene-chewing was seen as the epitome of drama club elitism. And while they’ve relocated from northern farming town Kendal to London and occupy their own sweet spot between the top of the pops and the basement, Wild Beasts still side with the have-nots without condescending. “Nature Boy” plays off a common artistic trope—here’s a wild man that will do things to your woman that your white-collar, Victorian ass can’t even imagine and she’s <i>really</i> into it. That sort of thing is right within Fleming’s wheelhouse, but that dynamic seems a little too simplistic for Wild Beasts. You might miss the money quote courtesy of Jake “The Snake” Roberts (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IcD2mQGoqKY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“A little fun for me/ And none for you”</a>),<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9302-wild-beasts/""> but the title is indeed a Ric Flair reference</a>, and so the and so the caricatured imagery of “Nature Boy” makes the song as a whole a laugh at how complexities of class, masculinity, and sex can often be reduced to the heel/babyface duality of pro wrestling.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A similar skewering occurs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16488-wild-beasts-wanderlust/"">“Wanderlust”</a>, which thankfully doesn’t aspire to be another pat, “Common People”-style rant about the rich kids fetishizing artistic “authenticity.” Instead, Thorpe questions the reductionism that goes on in both sides and the self-obsession that goes into any artistic pursuit. ""In the mother tongue/ What's the verb 'to suck?'"", Thorpe taunts, a subliminal at some fellow UK band getting a little too obvious in their Americanization. It also makes you wonder if “Nature Boy” might be a metaphor for how Wild Beasts compare to some of their more accommodating and popular peers. So what is “Wanderlust” doing as the opener on a record that focuses so much on domestic satisfaction? Get to the closer “Palace” and Thorpe bookends it by singing, “Baby there’s have alls and there are have nots/ I’m happy with what I got”. Both songs speak on the futility of trying to attain any sort of real happiness trying to be someone else. Lucky for us, there’s no one else like them and on <i>Present Tense,</i> their success has allowed Wild Beasts to be even more like themselves.</p></div>"|18961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18961-wild-beasts-present-tense/|8.2|Ian Cohen

It's a 4 pm kind of record, a soundtrack for the moment when the sun hasn't set yet, the day is more behind us than ahead of us, and we're momentarily unsure of what to do with ourselves. Most people smooth over this unpleasant transition with a drink or three, but </span><i>Indoor Living</i><span> spends 48 minutes lingering there. As a result, it's a slightly odd Superchunk record, neither tortured like </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15889-foolish/"">Foolish</a></i><span> nor desperate like </span><i>No Pocky for Kitty</i><span> nor delicate like </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7618-come-pick-me-up/"">Come Pick Me Up</a></i><span>. It's just slightly tired and enervated-sounding, and listening to it can occasionally feel that way.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Some of that slightly cratered feeling probably came from its surrounding circumstances. After burning through five records and multiple EPs in six years, Superchunk had reached a peak that suspiciously resembled a standstill. Their previous record, 1995's </span><span><i>Here's Where the Strings Come In</i>,</span><span> brought them close as they would ever get to mass success, which was, in hard terms, still ""nowhere near."" They had toured through Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance's grisly breakup record </span><i>Foolish</i><span>, during which Laura asked Mac's vocals to be removed from the monitors to keep her from crying onstage. Their fans were getting older and weren't coming to as many shows, and there wasn't necessarily by a new batch of fervent twenty-something's clamoring to take their place. It was a moment, if not to quit, then to step back and take stock. What next?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On the first song from </span><i>Strings</i><span>, McCaughan had concluded he was ""hyper enough as it is,"" so maybe a logical way forward was to find some way to calm down a little. </span><i>Indoor Living</i><span> was their first full-length stab at a more subdued and graceful version of themselves. They took the longest time between records in their history—two years—and spent more time working in mid tempo than they'd ever dared. On </span><i>Come Pick Me Up</i><span>, they would push further, embracing production from Jim O'Rourke and string arrangements, but </span><i>Indoor Living </i><span>isn't quite ready for all that. ""Those branches you thought would break, well they just bend, they just bend"" Mac observes on ""Burn Last Sunday,"" as if coaxing himself out of his corner.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The whole album has this tentative feel, from the brief flashes of ""mature"" instrumentation—the new wave synths on ""Watery Hands"", the stacked vocal harmonies of ""Under Our Feet"", the Mellotron on ""European Medicine""—to Mac's longer, breathier melody lines. You can hear him experimenting with melodic shapes that were less yelpy and declarative—the verse melody to""Unbelievable Things"" drapes across a languorous five-bar phrase, punctuated with an off bar, while the chorus unfurls over eight. He was also singing, softly and with soulful inflection. Sometimes it just doesn't work—the high note he hits on the second syllable of the chorus of ""Marquee"" can still make you wince. But sometimes, gloriously, it does. On the lovely ballad ""Every Single Instinct"", his voice scrapes up a stratospheric three-note run and is joined by Laura's bass, the two voices twining like ivy vines running up a wall. It could be from a Go-Betweens song, and is one of Superchunk's first successful un-Superchunk moments.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Judging from the lyrics, at least, they were pretty tired of being Superchunk. On songs like ""Marquee"", you can hear McCaughan massaging his temples: ""And your publicist was great/ She got me this date/ And although I can't complain, I do not like champagne/ You love the trading cards of fame,"" he sings caustically. ""They're charging admission now for your baby teeth and a lock of hair"" is the weary refrain ""Song for Marion Brown"". But Superchunk were never a sour band, even when they sang about sour things: Right after Mac's voice trails off on the chorus, the band quotes the mighty opening chords or ""Baba O'Riley"", one of classic rock's all-time great pure believer's hymns.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The reissue comes with terse liner notes from Laura Ballance, who recalls a stop-off at a local Hooters and not much else (“The food was not so good. The outfits were interesting”) that don’t do much to bolster <i>Indoor Living</i>’s reputation as the one where the fizz dissipated. The same dutifulness shades the bonus live disc, the latest in their long-running </span><span>Clambakes </span><span>series. The show, from Duke University show from 1997, opens with a cover of “Younger Bums” by Big Dipper before moving through some </span><i>Indoor Living</i><span> material—“Burn Last Sunday"", “Watery Hands”, “Song for Marion Brown”, among others. “Thanks for being so vocal, tents can be so impersonal” quips Mac at the outset, giving you a sense of the ambience. The set has some nice stuff in it, including a cover of the Mice’s “Bye Bye Kitty Cat” that they assay for the first time ever, but there isn’t much of a sense of event; this is just another stop on a tour leg, and it’s it’s difficult to imagine listening to it twice.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s a shame the gig didn’t include a performance of </span><i>Indoor Living</i><span>’s closer, “Martinis on the Roof.” In later years, Superchunk would take to playing this song for encores, and it has since settled into their canon.

But they begin slowly, a sinister riff cutting patiently through open air. The drums march rather than maraud, while the bass pads the pocket. It feels like the preamble of a classic rock anthem, perhaps the sequel to “Hells Bells”. But really, Behemoth want to make sure you can hear Nergal and understand him when he opens with purely heretic invective: “I saw the virgin’s cunt spawning forth the snake,” he hisses, clearly audible in his sibilance. “I witnessed tribes of Judah reduced to ruin.” Rather than emerge as though they have something to prove through speed and precision, one of heavy metal’s most popular bands elects to return with something to say that’s as vile and startling as most any moment in their previously impious two decades. Even the precipice of death, Nergal implies, didn’t soften his sacrilege.</p>
<p><i>The Satanist </i>is Behemoth’s 10th album, and in many ways, it reflects a synthesis of their stepwise, two-decade journey between atavistic black metal, expert death metal and a mid-career hybrid of the two. During the last decade, a bright studio gleam has often made their material feel cold and polished, as though the execution had superseded the core. This didn’t necessarily make for bad albums as much as it did middling ones, records that you could hear twice and move beyond. <i>The Satanist</i> doesn’t give up on high-end recording; in fact, with its occasional exultant choirs, horn fanfares, and acoustic interludes, it’s a complex and deliberate affair. This time, the sheen only highlights what’s beneath the surface, revealing these songs’ eccentricities and thrills rather than buffing them out. During “In the Absence ov Light”, for instance, Behemoth shift suddenly from a black metal raze into an impasse where acoustic guitar and soft jazz saxophone waft beneath a spoken passage from Polish writer Witold Gombrowicz. When the band returns, though, Nergal’s impatient voice and Inferno’s unsettled drums arrive with unexpected force, like closed fists swinging through the dark. It’s the sort of thrilling confluence of structure and sound that Behemoth has lacked on recent records.   </p>
<p>What’s more, these dynamic songs keenly balance the aggressive with the accessible, so that even the most volatile tantrums open wide at some point. After a slow-building introduction, “Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer” springs into a blast beat, with a pick slide leading to riffs pulled taut beneath Nergal’s rasp. But the refrain, a corruption of the Lord’s Prayer, is instantly unforgettable; the guitars change their pattern so that their notes push upward beneath the tune, countering the power with just a touch of pop. And wedged between a blues-like solo and an eruption of blast beats, the closer “O Father O Satan O Sun!” crests in a chorus worthy of an Amon Amarth anthem. <i>The Satanist</i> is vividly rendered, with bright moments that shine outward from the prevailing doom and themes that wind into dense knots and unravel into electrifying leads.</p>
<p>Much as they’ve always done, Behemoth state their intentions and ideals in hyperbole throughout <i>The Satanist</i>, with polemics that pass beyond the threshold of mere anti-Christian antagonism. Nergal writes of massaging mold into pages of scripture and infecting the cross with woodworms. That’s presumably a rather steep barrier to entry for many, but the rhetoric is meant to be a tad ridiculous, something Nergal plainly admits. “I really hope that people can read between the lines,” <a href=""http://loudwire.com/behemoth-nergal-the-satanist-2014-metal-alliance-tour/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told Loudwire earlier this year.</a> He’s long clashed with the Polish government over his expressed religious views. “I really hope they don’t take things in a very literal way.” And that is the real trick of <i>The Satanist</i>, an album that, in spite of its title and tone, ultimately feels less about “bit[-ing] the withered hand of God” than besting the odds and avoiding the comfort of conformity. This is something that Behemoth’s recent albums have refused to do themselves, after all.</p>
<p>Nergal is careful to stretch his style sheet of references beyond the Devil and Christ; he folds Latin and Coptic concepts into these lines, even nodding to John Milton in one passing moment. “Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel” might crib some of the Bible’s key concepts and phrases, including Gabriel’s horns, but it actually celebrates any collapse of absolute power. And near the middle of “Amen”, Nergal falls out of the accelerating pace and yells the album’s most essential phrase in his lowest tone: “Credo undone”, he bellows, stretching that last syllable until it blurs into the record’s most delirious solo. That proclamation has less to do with the Devil and more to do with everything else in the world. There was some doubt, after all, if Nergal would even <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/14452-nergal-interview-behemoth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live long enough to make another album</a>. And there was certainly more doubt than hope that, if Behemoth did finish a tenth record, it would stand somehow as a late-career renaissance. But <i>The Satanist </i>is a terrific coil of most everything Behemoth have ever done well, a strangely hopeful vision of hell wrested away from its very grip.  </p></div>"|19021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19021-behemoth-the-satanist/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

In collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"" target=""_blank"">Stars of the Lid</a>’s Adam Wiltzie, she made up half of the Dead Texan, whose 2004 collection of noisy vignettes supposedly stemmed from aborted SotL pieces. These sketches were too aggressive to fit in with Wiltzie’s main project and Vantzou, who was then best known as a maker of bleary short films, stepped in. The Dead Texan’s music was all loops and whorls, more intent on grabbing your attention than SotL’s work but still grounded in the monochromatic haze that Vantzou would go on to explore in her visual art and in solo material. Her new solo album, <i>No. 2</i>, underscores her commitment to subtle composition.</p>
<p><i>No. 2</i> takes the gauzy, filmic work that made up Vantzou’s first release and homes in on the emotionally engaging details. Even with its expanded instrumental palette and larger string section, it’s small moments that give her music a new diversity. Vantzou’s bedtime symphonies have been fleshed out with the addition of woodwinds and a more dynamic use of her voice, and “Sister” in particular stands out for its foreboding clarinet swells in the midst of an album heavily reliant on a glacial string section.</p>
<p>Vantzou works well with the short form: <i>No. 2</i> is only 35 minutes, without any tracks breaching the five minute mark, so her amorphous drones never overstay their welcome. And while there are no appreciable hooks, Vantzou has a pop sense of timing and she’s intent on making this record a digestible whole. Each track carries its own emotional weight. Even “Strange Symptoms”, which is little more than a minute-long keyboard drone, functions as a placid comedown from the elemental movements that bookend it.</p>
<p>Still, <i>No. 2</i> still holds onto that unassuming nature, for better and for worse. When moments like the funereal horn lines on “Vostok” break into the open after several tracks of frigid drones, the contrast is absolutely heart-rending. But these transcendent moments are few, and No. 2 could still use a little more of that drama.</p></div>"|19064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19064-christina-vantzou-no-2/|6.9|Colin Joyce

On <i>Inner Fire</i>, the Ottawa collective sounds different. The program is once again curated by composer and bandleader Pierre Chrétien, who brings a crate-digger’s thirst for obscure and offbeat musical idioms. Under his direction, SJO patch together swatches of North American, African, and Latin styles to create hybrids that resist easy categorization.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Inner Fire</i> consists of intricately arranged, harmonically adventurous Afro-Latin jazz; this sound, when paired with the lush piano and vibraphone backgrounds Chrétien favors, creates resonances with Mulatu Astatke’s Ethio-jazz. The driving polyrhythms of Nigerian folk music that marked their earlier work are set aside in favor of more laid-back percussion indigenous to the Americas. The album’s highlights are its most culturally ambiguous selections, like “One Life to Live”, which mixes rhumba and reggaeton rhythms, and “Sommet En Sommet”, a dense, three-against-four shuffle influenced partially by Guinean music. “As the Crow Flies”, the single finest track, unites an unsettled horn theme and modal chord changes that would be at home on a pre-electric Herbie Hancock record with a bossa nova backbeat.</p>
<p>Equally fundamental to the ethos of <i>Inner Fire</i> is the school of spiritual jazz that blossomed in the wake of John Coltrane’s Eastern-influenced explorations of the mid–1960s. The band has always claimed the style as a source of inspiration—their 2007 album <i>Freedom No Go Die</i> features a rendition of Pharoah Sanders’ hypnotic half-hour opus “The Creator Has a Master Plan”. Steve Patterson and Ray Murray, the SJO’s tenor and baritone players, often channel the legendary saxophonist in their solos, and Chrétien frequently emulates the keyboard flourishes of McCoy Tyner and Alice Coltrane.</p>
<p><i>Inner Fire</i> falters when the ensemble attempts full pieces in the “spiritual” mold, as on “Black Orchid"", a slick piece of lite-funk. The spare, blues-inflected dirge “East Flows the River” lacks some much-needed disruptive element or event to keep it from sounding like a jazzy piece of boom-bap rap production without an MC. “Celestial Blues”, a cover of a Roland Kirk-styled piece of 70s avant-soul by Gary Bartz NTU Troop makes one curious about the original record, but the SJO’s version itself ultimately comes off as inert.</p>
<p><i>Inner Fire</i>'s biggest problem is a sporadic lack of energy. The band’s recent interest in more introspective and less tightly structured music doesn’t always play to their strengths, namely, their ability to devise and deliver taut and constantly mutating arrangements. But the group's impulse to dismantle and globalize their sound (or their refusal to settle on one) is admirable, and their efforts to do so result in some inventive moments.</p></div>"|19057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19057-the-souljazz-orchestra-inner-fire/|6.6|Winston Cook-Wilson

Instead of a much-needed daring comeback statement, it's more like a pointed exhale. It feels safe.</span></p>
<p>Beck’s music didn’t used to be comfortable. Early on, if he wasn't putting a modern twist on the blues tradition, he was splicing styles that had never met before, or paying tribute to his R&amp;B heroes with unabashed glee. His entire ethos involved challenges: to history, to authenticity, to cliché. So when 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/617-sea-change/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sea Change</i></a> came along with its heartbroken callbacks to Serge Gainsbourg, Nick Drake, and Gordon Lightfoot, it was surprising because it was so straightforward—and emotive. It had the poster boy of irony looking straight into the camera and confessing his bitterness and desolation following a breakup. <i>Morning Phase</i> marks the first time since then that Beck has returned to this more forthright style, partly due to the fact that a batch of tapes containing <i>Sea Change</i>-style demos were tragically lost in the years following that album. But while the new record is unequivocally related to its forebear—it features most of the same players and a strikingly similar sonic palette—there are differences that set it apart, and bring it down.</p>
<p>Rather than focussing on a resigned anger or ambiguous darkness, <i>Morning Phase </i>is plagued by a frustrating in-between-ness that can also come off as flat and neutral. Many of the lyrics read like vague zen koans that perilously walk a tightrope above meaninglessness: wheels turn, hearts beat, skies fall. Without many concrete details to anchor the songs, they can become too ethereal for their own good. Part of the idea behind <i>Morning Phase</i> involves renewal and maturation: If you live to be a married 43-year-old father of two, Beck may be saying, the peaks and valleys of youth eventually even out. The sense of loss on the album is more internalized and indirect, which is interesting in theory, but in practice it can dull things into oblivion. ""Say Goodbye"" strings together breakup scenes with Beck as the narrator who's seen it all before but can only muster sidelined commentary. ""These are the words we use to say goodbye,"" he shrugs. You get an overall sense of wisdom from the lines on this album, though that wisdom too rarely coalesces into something truly affecting.  </p>
<p>All of which is even more vexing due to the fact that most of <i>Morning Phase</i> sounds stunning; as the producer of the album, Beck matches <i>Sea Change</i> studio guru Nigel Godrich tweak for tweak. But that raises another issue: While Beck's technical chops have grown impressively, <i>Morning Phase </i>only proves that he can tackle <i>Sea Change</i>-style production, like he's trying to redraw a masterpiece. Even so, his singing has never felt stronger, adding to the voice-of-god vibe (which plays through to his practically disembodied head on the album's cover). And every guitar pluck and string swipe is rendered with a warmth that backs up Beck's analog evangelicalism; on the gorgeous proper opener ""Morning"", you can practically see the rays of California sun peek through the blinds before the light comes through full-force on the hook. ""Unforgiven"", another highlight, very well may be Beck's finest technical vocal performance as he milks every syllable while his composer father David Campbell provides a swirling symphony behind him. The similarly epic ""Wave"", however, falls into melodrama and ends up sounding like a lesser version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>'s Godrich-produced <a href=""http://youtu.be/s2VzLn6DMCE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pyramid Song""</a>. So while <i>Morning Phase</i> is remarkably easy to listen to, the distinction isn't completely praiseworthy. </p>
<p>Recalling his 1990s emergence in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8026-beck-15-years/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork interview from 2011</a>, Beck said, ""Back then I had a feeling that we weren't quite measuring up to the music that had come before, or it just wasn't as important somehow."" Of course, for a generation of adventurous music fans who sang along with <a href=""http://youtu.be/uxugaMpt1vU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The New Pollution""</a> in the backseat, artists like Beck and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth </a>were indeed more important than the classic rockers who came before them, even if it didn't seem so at the time. And the way that those artists dismantled the known canon and morphed new shapes from it made them exciting. Based on some of his recent work—a 30-minute track here, a songbook album there—Beck does not seem through with trying to rearrange our musical synapses, which is why <i>Morning Phase</i> ultimately is a disappointment. Not only does it uphold the myths of baby boomer greats like the Byrds, Neil Young, and Simon and Garfunkel with a staid type of reverence, but it also piggybacks on the legacy of one of Beck's best records. It's the sound of a rule-breaker dutifully coloring inside the lines.</p></div>"|18959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18959-beck-morning-phase/|6.8|Ryan Dombal

He shared a playlist of material featuring musicians fascinated by the capabilities of synthesizers—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"" target=""_blank"">Paul McCartney</a>'s ""Temporary Secretary"", Wendy Carlos' <i>Switched on Bach</i>, Chrome, Eno, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a> (from <i>Ralf &amp; Florian</i>), early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a>, Les Rallizes Dénudés, and a handful of compilation-based oddities. Some of the artists in his playlist couldn't easily perform those songs live due to technical complications. For them, fiddling with a Moog meant, in many cases, experimenting in solitude. McCartney, for example, has <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/06417-paul-mccartney-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discussed</a> his initial fascination with synthesizers, when he walked away from Wings' recent breakup and made the one-man album <i>II</i>. ""I just wanted to see what it was all about, and have a go, and see what I could do with it,"" he said.</p>
<p>McCartney's story feels like an applicable parallel to Dwyer's new album, released under the name Damaged Bug. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a> aren't breaking up, though—they're taking a break and have a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53948-thee-oh-sees-announce-new-album-drop-share-penetrating-eye/"">new album</a> coming this spring.) Dwyer recently decided, after years of making primarily guitar-centric music, to track down a synthesizer he remembered from his childhood, one that was sold by RadioShack in the early 1980s: the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_Concertmate_MG-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Realistic MG-1</a>. ""A buddy of mine had it as a kid and I always coveted it,"" he told Rollins. Through the span of an entire month just before he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/210-they-got-the-neutron-bomb-los-angeles-potentially-huge-rocknroll-year/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">moved from San Francisco to L.A.</a>, he had a go with his new machine. He wrote and recorded <i>Hubba Bubba</i>, an album where he largely set his guitar aside in favor of his newly acquired early 1980s Moog, in solitude.</p>
<p>As the album's central piece of equipment likely suggests, no, these aren't the slick, sophisticated, polished synth sounds from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18004-classixx-hanging-gardens/"">the last Classixx record</a>. They're songs largely defined by blaring, primitive sonics—fried electronic bleats that suit the name ""Damaged Bug."" And if you go in expecting to hear the microphone swallowing, tongue dangling maniac who made the kinetic burners from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17866-thee-oh-sees-floating-coffin/""><i>Floating Coffin</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16013-carrion-crawlerthe-dream/""><i>Carrion Crawler/The Dream</i></a>, adjust your expectations; <i>Hubba Bubba</i>'s songs take their time. Occasionally, they trudge. The only respite from the prolonged, droning synths on ""Photograph"" are Dwyer's breathy vocals. ""Hubba Bubba"", a soberly sung love song about a shared piece of bubblegum, moves even more slowly. Then there's the three-minute instrumental ""Catastrophopbia"", a cool down between tracks—just persistent thumps, a burnt digital echo, and the occasional noodling on the MG-1. In terms of tempo and arrangements, the album is sparse enough as it is, and therefore, does not require a cool down.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it's a mistake to call foul on all of <i>Hubba Bubba</i>'s slow or quiet moments<i>—</i>an easy thing to do if you're using Oh Sees songs like ""The Dream"" as a rubric. The loose narrative calls for darkness. Consider lyrics like ""I want to live like a human,"" which in the context of dated synthesizers can sound like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"" target=""_blank""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>-style plea to ""give life back to music,"" but in the context of Dwyer's detached vocals, it could just as easily be read as yearning for normalcy. ""What kind of fool am I,"" he asks on ""Eggs at Night"" before talking about ""seeing endless empty night."" The album's full of these big, dramatic questions and statements, like ""Am I a waste of life?"" or ""Anyone can see it's all been a lie"".</p>
<p>Thankfully, it's not just dour missives and desolation—there's life in these songs. Dwyer's unmistakable guitar sound makes an appearance on ""Gloves for Garbage"", adding some welcome traction to the song's persistent synth warble. On tracks like ""Eggs at Night"" and ""Wasteland"", he uses his synth to craft hooks with momentum, then he supplements them with handclaps, sleigh bells, and of course, actual drums. Probably the best moment on the album comes during its centerpiece, ""Sic Bay Surprise"", which has the same sort of sweet, quiet harmonies that were typical of Oh Sees songs like ""No Spell"". Then, at the end of one of the verses, you can hear his unmistakeable falsetto yelp: ""OW!"" One syllable, slightly muted in the mix, on an album packed with deep-voiced stoicism; one small indication that he's having fun.</p></div>"|19041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19041-damaged-bug-hubba-bubba/|6.8|Evan Minsker

With their winning blend of scrappiness, conviction, and smarts, the EPs remain well worth your while: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxezbqwbTVY&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Start of Something""</a> is particularly indelible, though its title feels ironic in hindsight.</p>
<p>No one guessed that Voxtrot's start would be so close to its end, especially after they signed with <span class=""st"">Beggars Banquet</span>. But on their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10249-voxtrot/"">self-titled 2007 LP</a>, their rambunctious energy crumpled under self-conscious arrangements, and the band itself crumpled under the weight of the mixed reactions to it. They eked out a murky <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11132-trepanation-party/"">last EP in 2009</a> and kept performing until 2010, but as of 2007 they were no longer part of the conversation.</p>
<p>The mid-2000s were kind of crazy times. Our current dispensation, where bands can use the internet to circumvent indie labels like their forebears did the majors, was still taking shape. This was before Bandcamp and SoundCloud, when one could still write about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11132-trepanation-party/"">""the promotional power of the mp3""</a> as something novel. The digital DIY narrative crystallized around <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/953-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/"">Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</a> in 2005, in a cultural climate both drunk on and wary of hype.</p>
<p>As the industry kept granulating, so did critical influence. Blogs and websites, figuring out how to wield newfound power, often raced to greet anything promising with preemptive enthusiasm that could abruptly shift to disproportionate disappointment in a way that must have seemed capricious on the receiving end. Young bands now take immediate and overwhelming scrutiny for granted—or crave it. But they weren't used to it back then.</p>
<p>""The career path of Voxtrot was truly one of long, simmering build, explosion, and almost instantaneous decay,"" Srivastava wrote in a <a href=""http://www.voxtrot.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2010 breakup note</a>. ""Slowly, I am learning to replace any feelings of regret with positive memories of how amazing the whole thing was, and how it has, in an unexpected way, fortified my character."" The experience feels faintly scarred on this comeback LP, where something new in his voice sounds shaky and proud.</p>
<p>What hasn't changed is the sweetness of that voice, with its delicate buoyancy that makes me want to hear him cover Paul Simon. And the songs, which are mostly made with electric guitar, piano, bass, drums, and light synthesizers, aren't terribly different from Voxtrot: There's aching chamber pop (""The King""), danceable indie rock (""1111""), and amalgams of them both (""Youth Trip""). An eclectic roster of backing musicians and producers (such as Jim Eno) includes Voxtrot alums Jason Chronis, Mitch Calvert, and Jared Van Fleet. But the tempos are generally slower, the vocals more vulnerable, the arrangements, with a couple exceptions, more cautious.</p>
<p>String-and-piano ballads and bouncy disco-pop tracks are Srivastava’s strong suits, and there are quite a few enjoyable ones here. Not everything works: The harp and trumpet on ""American Lust"" feel a bit aimless, and the segue from whispered poetry to frantic noise rock on ""Lux"" is just strange. Some lyrics, no longer glossed over in wordy gouts, are distractingly sentimental (there are occasional rainbows, angels, ecstasies). But <i>The King</i> is a plainer, more enjoyable album than the one Voxtrot finished with, and feels like a foundation Srivastava could rebuild upon, a few years later and an age away.</p></div>"|19044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19044-ramesh-the-king/|6.5|Brian Howe

We're talking six releases of note in just over 24 months—<i>Subject: Matter, Chimera, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17074-first-of-a-dying-breed/"" target=""_blank"">First of a Living Breed</a>,</i> <i>Kool Herc: Fertile Crescent,</i> and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18354-homeboy-sandman-all-that-i-hold-dear/"" target=""_blank""><i> All That I Hold Dear </i></a>all dropped through 2013, with <i>White Sands</i>, his first release of 2014,<i> </i>making it half a dozen. If you've ever tried to commit yourself to getting into Sandman's dryly incisive style—all scalpel-wielding deadpan and internally knotted wit and ha-ha-wait one-liners—there're more fresh entry points than Sonny Corleone post-tollbooth.</p>
<p>But if you're not converted yet, why not go for the EP produced by the man who helped get <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>'s “Wonderbread” permanently lodged in countless listener's brains? Paul White's contributions to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18565-danny-brown-old/""><i>Old </i></a>authoritatively put White on the radar, but his years' worth of previous work included a couple collaborations with Homeboy Sandman that already set a positive precedent. Sandman's White collabs on the <i>Chimera </i>EP breathed vividly through minor-key Michael Mann glow (“Look Out”) and VHS-fidelity late-summer soul murk (“They Can't Hang (Word to the Mother)”). And his spot the next year waxing anxious over a stargazing shuffle beat on White's <i>Watch the Ants </i>endcap “Find a Way” made it clear they had a mutually beneficial set of styles going.</p>
<p>Hence <i>White Sands—</i>even the title's slick wordplay makes this team-up seem preordained. Sandman's clear-eyed, clinical yet humane dissection of daily experience benefits from a similarly subdued production that holds just a few ripples of detectable tension beneath. White's sound here is the kind of thing worth conjuring up when attempting to figure out if there's such a thing as a Stones Throw house style: you get obscuro-soul beats filtered through quaver and hiss on some old-cassette shit, sawn-off basslines and snares that sound like baseball bats against padded walls, and vocals pitched up until they sound just the right side of bewildered. That, plus there's a goofy streak somewhere in there. I'm sure there are slower fadeouts than the dying-battery nod-off of “Fat Belly"", but none I can think of that're accompanied by enthusiastic food crunching noises.</p>
<p>Granted, those crunching noises come after a bunch of verses relating to Sandman's vegan/organic/health food diet, which reclaims almond milk and lentils from hippie-dippie yuppie-shopper punchline status and flips it through his own eat-right lens in the tradition of A Tribe Called Quest's “Ham 'n' Eggs”. From there on out there's ample proof that Sandman's blend of straight-up rhyming, conceptual thrust, and worldbuilding storytelling is yet again on point. In doses of little interconnected one-liner details, unspooling over “I Saw a World” or “Bad Meaning Good"", his negative-space-heavy hard-stop flow lets the snapshots come into focus. Bigger-picture stories feel like they could go on for another half-dozen verses—there's devastating depth to the broken woman depicted at the core of “Echoes” (“Her mother once beside herself with worry/ Now she wander right beside her none the wiser/ She didn't recognize her”). Sure, <i>White Sands </i>is something of a self-contained universe, another one-producer release in the tradition of ""EL RNTC"" collab <i>Kool Herc: Fertile Crescent</i> and the M. Slago-helmed <i>All That I Hold Dear</i>. But it's a universe with a lot to explore.</p></div>"|19034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19034-homeboy-sandman-white-sands/|7.3|Nate Patrin

Do you have <a href=""ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFH1BBdxGjw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an allergy to certain delicious herbal tea blends</a>? If you said yes to any of these questions, the members of Tacocat are not your friends, but you might end up liking them anyway. Though they've been around since 2007, the Seattle quartet are relatively new to a wider audience. Over the past few months, they've been expanding upon their longtime underground reputation as a gutsy bubblegum surf-rock outfit bolstered by an <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1269&amp;bih=495&amp;q=tacocat+meme&amp;oq=tacocat+meme&amp;gs_l=img.3...1680.3159.0.3574.12.12.0.0.0.0.101.620.7j1.8.0....0...1ac.1.35.img..4.8.619.s1aQ0uUL20k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">adorable meme</a>, some goofy Y2K nostalgia, and—above all—an unparalleled feminist wit that's hard to hate, even if you're the target.</p>
<p>It's born of practice: Tacocat's Hardly Art debut, the ironically sunshiny <i>NVM</i>, is hardly their first foray into the satire game. Back in 2012, vocalist Emily Nokes and bassist Bree McKenna were the pair of masterminds behind <a href=""http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/men-who-rock/Content?oid=14913816"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Men Who Rock,"" the now-legendary cover feature</a><i> </i>of local Seattle weekly <i>The Stranger </i>that brilliantly skewered the music media's objectification of female musicians. Two years later, <i>NVM</i>—an abbreviation for ""nevermind"" coined by the post-Nirvana AOL generation—has become an extension of that tradition, turning just the right cheerful screws on haters from all corners of their hegemonic hellscape.</p>
<p>Whether it's the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze#The_.22male_gaze.22_in_feminist_theory"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">male gaze</a> (""Hey Girl"") or menstruation (""Crimson Wave""), seasonal affective disorder (""Bridge to Hawaii"") or becoming a woman (""Psychedelic Quinceañera""), or even just hometowns that have a collective aneurysm every time it snows (""Snow Day"")—no vexation is safe from the sprightly melodies of Tacocat. ""In my experience, making jokes about that kind of stupid stuff has made people check themselves more than when people yell at them about it,"" Nokes <a href=""http://rookiemag.com/2014/01/crimson-wave-tacocat/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said in a recent interview</a>. So instead of a blistering indictment, she and her friends made an album that throws a double-handful of confetti in the face of topics that might otherwise induce rage blackouts, a light-hearted reminder that sometimes the best way to defeat an enemy is to make them sheepishly laugh. </p>
<p>Like many of their compatriots, Tacocat draw as heavily on 60s surf rock and girl-group radio hits as they do on 90s and 00s MTV alt-rock rotation (""Quinceañera"" is bolstered by horns worthy only of Cake), but where peers have settled for simple, fest-ready party rock, Tacocat use those influences to complement a musical comedy that's effortless and immediately justifies its existence: I didn't realize I needed a song about hating my bus line with an all-consuming passion, yet ""FU #8"" delivers like a <i>Sky Mall </i>patent direct from heaven. Almost every track, save the disappointing-only-by-comparison ""Alien Girl"" and opener ""You Never Came Back"", serves a highly specific, completely unromantic purpose, especially in the lives of women: they're simple theme songs, #realtalk jingles to tuck away in the personal artillery that gets you through a particularly dumb day.</p>
<p>And though it seems downright insane when paired with the actual sounds contained on the album, most of <i>NVM</i>, despite its humor, is still sincerely concerned with the bullshit inherent in power structures, as much as a Bikini Kill or a Sleater-Kinney or even a White Lung. It<i> </i>lacks the sonic weight that so easily matches those feminist frustrations, but it would be foolish to want such things of a band like Tacocat, because there are so few places in which to find sentiments like these in such a refreshingly sunny musical context. The only anchor the album really needs is the certainty that one day your world will treat you like utter garbage, and only the sarcastic irreverence of Tacocat can lift you out of your vortex of suckitude. Cheeky but not bratty, <i>NVM </i>leaves a statement behind without preaching or scolding (save perhaps on ""This Is Anarchy,"" a satirical, natural mate to millennial eye-rollers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18347-bent-shapes-feels-weird/"">Bent Shapes</a>' ""Brat Poison""). It's simple and approachable, but its wit gives it longevity—at least, until a song about ""<a href=""http://www.allowe.com/laughs/book/Euphemisms%20for%20That%20Time%20of%20the%20Month.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">communists in the summer house</a>"" is passé.</p></div>"|19049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19049-tacocat-nvm/|7.4|Devon Maloney

Its songs sprout with their own strange, squiggly lifeforms and are governed by unfamiliar laws of gravity. Check out the first one, ""Rattlesnake"", a song that's bare, Kraftwerky, and full of imagery that is somehow both Edenic and post-apocalyptic. Clark glances around: ""Am I the only one in the only world?"" She spots the title creature, gasps, and then comes this song's idea of a chorus, like melodic gagging, or distress expressed in an 8-bit video game: ""AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH AHH AHH/ AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH AHH AHH."" You often get the sense in a St. Vincent song that Clark has touched down on a desolate, previously unexplored planet without an air supply and is showing off the fact that—for the moment at least—she can still breathe.</p>
<p>Given the fangs she bares on <i>St. Vincent</i>, it seems like Clark could take that snake, easily. Over the course of four albums, many early-career guest spots, and a 2012 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17026-love-this-giant/"">collaboration</a> with David Byrne, Clark has been focusing her vision and sharpening her music's edges; were it not for Google image search, it would be easy to convince yourself that you merely dreamed those days when she <a href=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2j1e1QvmG1rtmi5eo1_500.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wore butterfly wings with Sufjan Stevens</a> and <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/img/music/annieps.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blithely flowing robes with the Polyphonic Spree</a>. With each release, Clark sounds less like anybody but herself, and more forcefully embraces a darkness that was quietly stirring in even her earliest songs. ""You don't mean that, say you're sorry,"" she chimed in a creepy, <i>Bride of Chucky</i> voice on her still-magnificent debut single, ""Now, Now"". But the smirking overlord that stares out from the cover of <i>St. Vincent</i> does not apologize, not for any of the unpleasantries she utters through gritted teeth, nor the much nastier things she blurts out her fingers.</p>
<p><i>St. Vincent</i> continues Clark's run as one of the past decade's most distinct and innovative guitarists, though she's never one to showboat. Her harmonic-filled style bears the influence of jazz (she picked up a lot of her signature tricks from her uncle, the jazz guitarist Tuck Andress) and prog rock, two genres known to embrace sprawl. But Clark's freak-outs are tidy, modular and architecturally compact—like King Crimson rewritten by Le Corbusier. Even at its most spazzy, there's always something efficient about <i>St. Vincent</i>. The stark, spring-wound single ""Birth in Reverse"" doesn't waste a second on superfluous sounds, and the same goes for the corrosive crunch of ""Regret"", which sounds like a classic rock song pared down to its most essential elements. All the negative space in that last one makes Clark's riffs hit that much harder, especially when—in one of the most thrilling moments on the album—a solo strikes down out of nowhere like a cartoon lightning bolt.</p>
<p>Critics of St. Vincent call her pretentious. Fair enough—these are the sorts of songs that dare take themselves seriously and tack on easy suffixes like ""in America"" when they want to let you know they are Making a Statement. But there's an under-appreciated playfulness about Clark's music that balances this out. I can't think of much contemporary guitar-based music that has this much fun with texture—the rubbery whiplash percussion on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16615-prince-johnny/"" target=""_blank"">""Prince Johnny""</a>, the stretched-taffy vocals on ""Bring Me Your Loves"", the gleefully synthetic-on-purpose sheen of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16470-st-vincent-digital-witness/"" target=""_blank"">""Digital Witness""</a>. At best, <i>St. Vincent </i>has a mischievous curiosity about texture (and explosions) that feels almost childlike. Recently my 8 year-old cousin asked me, with a wicked twinkle in his eye, if I'd ever microwaved a banana. I'm terrified to try, but I'm sure whatever happens—splattering, abrupt, radioactive—sounds exactly like an Annie Clark guitar solo.</p>
<p>""What's the point in even sleeping/ If I can't show, if you can't see me?"" Clark asks on the single ""Digital Witness"", a rather on-the-nose critique of our hyper-transparent, Instagram-your-every-meal culture. It's tempting to label <i>St. Vincent</i> Clark's anti-internet album, but that wouldn't be quite right—it knows too well what a life mediated through screens feels and sounds like to be sending it up entirely. (In fact, digital life may have influenced her concise, anti-jam style: ""I have some restless ears, and I now have a fractured attention span because I'm like living in the modern world,"" she said in <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2014/02/16/st_vincent_i_have_this_sound_in_my_head_how_do_i_get_it_here_in_my_fingers/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview</a>. ""So I'm like, how do I make this sound interesting to myself?"") ""Huey Newton"" is maybe one of the best songs ever written about falling down a late-night, vaguely depressive internet k-hole (""Pleasure dot loathing dot Huey dot Newton/ Oh, it was a lonely, lonely winter""); seemingly stream-of-conscious references to Black Panthers, Byzantine architecture, and the Heaven's Gate cult flicker by like puzzlingly connected Wikipedia pages. The common threads emerge if you look closely. From the self-coronated Prince Johnny to the ""near-future cult leader"" Clark has fashioned herself on the album cover, there's a fascination with power, faith, and mind-control running through these songs—learning how to sell yourself your own lines well enough to sell them back to other people, too.</p>
<p>""I was reading Miles Davis' biography,"" Clark says of her Beyoncé-like decision to self-title a record this late in her career, ""and he says that the hardest thing for a musician to do is sound like yourself."" In that sense, it's a perfect title. <i>St. Vincent</i> is the Platonic ideal of a St. Vincent record, executing with perfect poise everything we already know she can do. But this also is why it falls just short of being her best. That honor still goes to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15813-strange-mercy/""><i>Strange Mercy</i></a>, which had a capacity to surprise and defy expectations in a way that this record does not. <i>Strange Mercy</i> was easier to connect to emotionally (""If I ever meet the dirty police man who roughed you up,"" she cooed on the title track, a line that was as jarring for its tenderness as it was for its violence) and gave Clark a little more room to stretch her legs in the grooves. The pixelated shredding on ""Huey Newton"" and ""Regret"" are great, but nothing here feels as unhinged as the borealis chaos of at the end of ""Northern Lights"" or the razor-sharp coda of ""Surgeon"". The Bowie-esque metamorphosis suggested by the cover image doesn’t mean she’s reinvented her sound. Of course it's not the worst problem for an artist to have, but Clark's become <i>so</i> good at being St. Vincent that, on future releases, she risks boxing herself in. You hope the next album finds her coloring outside the lines she's so meticulously drawn for herself.</p>
<p>Still, it’s hard to ask too much more from an album that boasts melodies as lovely as  ""Prince Johnny"" and ""Severed Crossed Fingers"". That last one is the best closing song on a St. Vincent album yet—a self-deprecating, slow-motion parade of a ballad that sounds like if Lorrie Moore had written the non-existent lyrics to “Here Come the Warm Jets”. (This song and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16428-birth-in-reverse/"" target=""_blank"">“Birth in Reverse”</a> both take their wry titles from Moore’s great short story collection <i>Birds of America</i>.) It’s a moment of vulnerability and bleak hope rounding out Clark’s hardest, tightest, and most confident record to date—a vaguely ominous promise of better days ahead. ""We’ll be heroes on every bar stool,"" she vows, sounding so sure of herself that you’re liable to follow her to whatever planet she’s headed.</p></div>"|19020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19020-st-vincent-st-vincent/|8.6|Lindsay Zoladz

It’s become painfully obvious that her status as a one-hit wonder has far less to do with her talents than how far she was ahead of her time.</p>
<p>Cherry’s early work has aged well. In 2012, she returned from a hiatus initiated after the back to back flops of the alt-rock-leaning follow-ups to her 1989 debut <i>Raw Like Sushi</i> (1996’s <i>Man</i> didn’t even get a U.S. release) with an album-length collaboration with the Scandinavian experimental jazz outfit the Thing that leaned heavy on dissonant avant-funk and turned the cliche of the club diva’s late-career “jazzy” phase on its ear. A companion collection of remixes, including one by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1548-kieran-hebden/"" target=""_blank"">Kieran Hebden</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>, followed. That crossing of paths has now led to Cherry album produced by Hebden that finally finds her returning to the basic—and hard to improve upon—combination of vocals and beats.</p>
<p><i>Blank Project</i> isn’t a roaring, triumphant return to form. Instead it’s understated to the extreme, a master class in the ways in which simple pleasures can become fascinatingly deep. The opening track, “Across the Water”, is simply Cherry singing over a bracingly austere drum arrangement, with zero in the way of melodic accompaniment. Between her rich, unembellished voice and emotional performance it’s somehow more overwhelming than most songs that have full orchestral backing.</p>
<p>From that point, things pick up a little, although only by degrees. The rest of the songs have basslines, but only about half go further to add lightly sketched synth parts on top. Some of the tracks push at the upper boundary of what’s normally considered mid-tempo, but most fit comfortably within that range. There are no grand stylistic gestures or unnecessary moving parts or anything that qualifies as fussy.</p>
<p>And yet within those parameters, Cherry and Hebden find a wealth of moods and modes to play with. The title track takes the ricocheting rhythms of drum’n’bass and floods its normally icy aura with warmth and organic dirt that Cherry half-sings, half-raps over; her delivery is forceful despite the fact that she barely raises her voice above a conversational level. “Spit Three Times” conjures up a woozy, paranoid atmosphere and a slow-grinding trip-hop beat out of what seems like mostly negative space. “Out of the Black”, featuring a vocal assist by Cherry acolyte <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a>, feels like an ecstatic club-pop anthem played with the subdued confidence of someone well beyond the point of caring whether anyone else gets turned up over it or not.</p>
<p>Minimalism is all the rage in the more hip-hop-aligned parts of the pop world, making <i>Blank Project</i> feel modern and stylish without exactly sounding fashionable. The album, and the woman steering it, are not only comfortable with their eccentricities but strengthened by them, and the effect is enthralling—not to mention a thorough schooling for the performers working in Cherry’s wake on how exactly to do the dead-cool, stripped-down thing. As such, it’s not hard at all to pick up some of her old “Buffalo Stance” cockiness in it. It’s a rare pleasure to see a musician who was under-appreciated during her heyday have a delayed influence a later generation of artists while she’s still in good working condition. It’s even rarer, and even more pleasurable, to see her staying a few lengthy strides ahead of the game.</p></div>"|19017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19017-neneh-cherry-blank-project/|7.7|Miles Raymer

The record delivered on the promise of the previous year's debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12840-watersports/"" target=""_blank""><i>Watersports</i></a>, suggesting that Mi Ami's sound was rapidly crystallizing. Then they splintered from the inside. Bassist Jacob Long left the band, and remaining members Damon Palermo and Daniel Martin-McCormick soldiered on with 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15219-dolphins/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dolphins</i></a>, a surprising left-turn that laid Martin-McCormick's panicked, flailing vocals over thick, clubby production.</p>
<p>Mi Ami's turn towards the dancefloor was surprising, but if you knew where to look, Palermo and Martin-McCormick's side projects left clues. Martin-McCormick's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29535-ital/"" target=""_blank"">Ital</a> took a noisy, chaotic approach to house, with two full-lengths on Planet Mu and a smattering of releases on other labels that ran the gamut from abusive, noisy body music to purple, psychedelic swarm; meanwhile, Palermo took a less circuitous path to club music as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30926-magic-touch/"" target=""_blank"">Magic Touch</a>.</p>
<p>His sole release from 2013, the solid <i>Nothing More</i> EP, carried a pristine sheen that sounded as if someone had taken a vacuum to the fuzzy detritus that surrounded his previous constructions for 100% Silk. Palermo's debut LP for the label, <i>Palermo House Gang</i>, still has plenty of dusty grit—one of the most endearing qualities of 100% Silk's output is how their releases sound as if you're hearing the music pumping out of speakers through thin walls in an adjacent room—but in its best moments, the melodies are sharp and bright, inching toward high-definition house.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, 100% Silk has overcome skepticism that their roster was mostly indie kids in dance music dress-up, and the imprint is now one of the most consistently interesting underground dance labels in North America. Even when considering the increased reliability of the label's catalog, though, <i>Palermo House Gang</i> is impressively robust, reverently embracing disco's sparkle and classic house music's sassy thump. The swaying saxophone of ""It's Love"" and ""Calabria""'s tropical humidity are not unlike something Frankie Knuckles would throw into one of his sets, while the synth bleats that open album highlight ""You"" provide a tricky nod to Alice Deejay's trance classic ""Better Off Alone"" before unfolding into the type of skipping, chopped-vocal body-mover evocative of New Jersey garage legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23832-todd-edwards/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Edwards</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to referencing house music, the title <i>Palermo House Gang</i> suggests that, keeping with Not Not Fun and 100% Silk's communal origins, this is a group effort. And the album is in fact heavy on collaboration. Notably, Brooklyn’s Octo Octa has his hand  in <i>Palermo House Gang</i>'s two most notable highlights: ""You"", which also features contributions from Body High-affiliated duo Newbody, and the 13-minute ""House of Intuition"", which accentuates dense drone and hypnotic hand-drum patterns with a cyclical, sharp synth line that opens up beautifully in the track's final minutes.</p>
<p>At its best, <i>Palermo House Gang</i> is pure dance music candy, smacking of familiar sounds done properly and with a little bit of roughness around the edges. Accordingly, the record's minor structural hiccups—an unnecessary second mix of ""It's Love"", the thin vocals laid atop opener ""I Need the Magic"", a general lack of cohesion—suggest Palermo's best work is yet to come. His most well-known project has been marked by its perpetual change, but Palermo seems to have found sonic stability on his own.</p></div>"|19033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19033-magic-touch-palermo-house-gang/|7.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Norway's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3194-erlend-ye/"" target=""_blank"">Erlend Øye</a>, one half of indie-folk duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2302-kings-of-convenience/"" target=""_blank"">Kings of Convenience</a>, has built much of his career aesthetic on this paradox. Recall the video for the 2004 single ""I'd Rather Dance With You"", which finds Øye in a red and white tracksuit, navigating a throng of giggling girls in a ballet class and letting his limbs fly and droop in a series of choreographed moves. He's a master of leaning calmly into his gawkiness rather than attempting to mask it, and he exudes an unassuming sort of confidence as a result. So it was no surprise to see him pop up alongside a young Bulgarian woman named DENA last summer in a video for a knowingly goofy but genuinely infectious rap single called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4CDc9yCAqE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools""</a>. There they were, two peas in a pod: gangly, welcoming, unpretentious, deeply European. ""If you're listening to this in a hot country/ Please come rescue me,"" DENA raps in her thick Bulgarian accent in an assortment of clashing outfits, ""If you got a swimming pool, then we can be hanging.”</p>
<p>Part M.I.A.-informed party rap, part YouTube novelty, part small-town Eastern European documentary, “Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools” had all the hallmarks of a meme-y, flash-in-the-pan internet rap hit. (DENA’s YouTube account name is ""denafromtheblock"".) But the kitsch of her style translates nicely across her debut album <i>Flash</i>, a small and inviting record that is unfazed—delighted, even—by its own rough edges and occasionally bumbling sensibilities. It’s an album that lifts from an almost comically basic hip-hop and social-media glossary to talk about young adult love and frustration and ambition in an endearing way: “Haters gonna hate/ Lovers gonna love/ If you mess with me/ You get a total ignore,” DENA raps bluntly on “Total Ignore”. “You can’t believe that my beats so banging/ Yeah, I made it all while you were hanging,” she boasts. The production, which DENA handled herself, is a studied blend of clatter, simple keyboard melodies, and quiet boom-bap.</p>
<p>Which isn’t to say that Flash is cartoon music. DENA strikes a delicate balance between sounding naive enough to pray to the altar of American rap flash and excess and savvy enough to recognize her own distance from it. “I haven’t been taking any planes today/ You’re the one who whisks away and I’m the one who stays,” she laments on “Jet Lag”. “I think I’m having jet lag without even having fun.” The record is more nuanced and knowing than simple white-girl gag rap; DENA’s charm buffers her from some of the pitfalls of her outsider-rap status. Flash carves her out a new space in a crowded sphere: She's a refreshing foil to the jaded slickness of an artist like Lorde, the brutal tone-deafness of someone like the white Swedish rapper Yung Lean, or the overbearing cutesiness of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30518-kitty-pryde/"" target=""_blank"">Kitty Pryde</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a sense that DENA earned her sly stripes because she's a true music nerd, and that she uses music as a means of escaping small-town claustrophobia. It’s evident on a song like “Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools”, where she sings that she’s “hanging here and wishing to be there, ending up with not really being anywhere.” Some of her best work came in the form of a SoundCloud mix called “High on Hi Hats”, which blended together an unexpected list of contemporary remix obscurities with forgotten classics like Guru and Kelis’ “Supa Love”. Like the best kind of nerd, she’s done her research. Now she just wants to participate and share, and doesn't mind showing off her imperfections in the process. </p></div>"|18985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18985-dena-flash/|6.7|Carrie Battan

They changed their name shortly afterward, because ""<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brooklynvegan.com%2Farchives%2F2012%2F01%2Freading_rainbow.html&amp;ei=n28GU4reFYujhgfY4oGwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9MA1-pKLGEMt8B1FBJqfPo-zA2Q&amp;bvm=bv.61725948,d.ZG4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">we didn't want to get a cease and desist order from PBS</a>,"" and because ""we like the name Bleeding Rainbow better."" Making the hobbled-ankle leap from one dubious, cutesy moniker to another in full view of your audience is, to put it bluntly, not a great way to ensure your future as a band.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>They didn't break up, however, and over a few records, they've slowly sorted out who they are. Their new album, <i>Interrupt</i>, is a zippy, Superchunk-y set of buttoned-tight pop-rock songs that bounce nimbly on their heels for three or so minutes and then briskly exit. The album captures the band at a senior-year-in-high-school moment in their development: The fuckups and ill-fitting poses are all pretty fresh in the minds of everyone around them, but they've located the beginnings of adult poise and their future looks brighter than their past.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For one, Sarah Everton has found a powerful mid-register voice that she can belt with, one she leans into enthusiastically on the real-deal big choruses of of ""Out of Line"" and ""Cut Up"". Robi Gonzalez, the drummer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5424-a-place-to-bury-strangers/"" target=""_blank"">A Place to Bury Strangers</a>, recorded the album with them and was promptly replaced by another drummer (Ashley Arnwine), and his work is a stiff shot of adrenaline. The rhythm section is pulled as tight as hotel bedsheets, Everton and Rob Garcia's vocals mesh neatly, and the tempo stays brisk. Everything on the album is busily competent and in cheerful working order, like a middle manager on their third cup of coffee making the late-morning rounds. The album is short and formulaic and bracing and, while it's playing, pretty great.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The band still doesn't have a distinct stamp, though; on ""Monochrome,"" they remain enraptured by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, dripping distorted glimmers and pitch-bends all over song's edges. Being many things at once isn't a sin, of course, but Bleeding Rainbow aren't great at enough of those things to justify using up our time trying them out. The strained, shouty ""Images"" recalls Foo Fighter's ""Monkey Wrench,"" and while ""Monkey Wrench"" is an excellent power-pop tune, the shouting does not flatter Garcia at all.""I fall all the time,"" goes the chorus to ""Cut Up,"" one of their punchiest and best songs. These guys may not be the most graceful outfit out there, but they are surprisingly scrappy, and they've picked themselves up from a couple of minor faceplants with aplomb. </div></div>"|19018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19018-bleeding-rainbow-interrupt/|6.4|Jayson Greene

It can mean ""the power you command,"" or it can be a pun on ""your arse an' all,"" but it's also a joke about an <a href=""http://www.arsenal.com/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">association football club</a> as subcultural identity. That suggests a song that might be a key to the record—a song that's not actually on it, but one that Morrissey had used to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA6q_bJpEsc&amp;t=4m26s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">end his 1990 videotape <i>Hulmerist</i></a> and would use as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VJZdiyZD64"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">entrance music</a> some years later.</p>
<p>The specter of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", the king of all <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCJ5uBA3DU4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">football-fan </a><span style=""color: #ef4135;"">sing-alongs</span> thanks to its association with Liverpool (and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GjXdizFs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a>), hovers over the whole album: the chopped-up football-kop voices in the middle of ""We'll Let You Know"", the chord progression and <a href=""http://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/i-know-its-gonna-happen-someday/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sentiment</a> of ""I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday"", and most of all the relatively uncharacteristic first-person plural Morrissey uses and implies throughout <i>Your Arsenal</i>. Viewed in that light, beginning the album with a song called ""You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side"" seems formally appropriate.</p>
<p>By 1992, that's exactly what Morrissey needed; he had apparently realized that, as Oscar Wilde might have put it, the only thing worse than being in a rock band was not being in a rock band. <i>Your Arsenal</i>, unlike the previous year's <i>Kill Uncle</i>, sounded like the work of a real group—as indeed it was. He'd assembled guitarists Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer, bassist Gary Day, and drummer Spencer Cobrin for the extensive <i>Kill Uncle</i> tour, and kept them around to record. (Boorer is still playing with Morrissey today, and Whyte stayed with him until 2004.) Boorer had previously played with rockabilly revivalists the Polecats, who'd had minor British hits with covers of David Bowie's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GirgbG9GxoQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""John, I'm Only Dancing""</a> and T. Rex's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSHLw8TjrgI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jeepster""</a>. And Morrissey roped in one of the former song's architects to produce <i>Your Arsenal</i>: Mick Ronson, who'd been Bowie's guitarist and principal creative foil in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Morrissey has never been shy about paying homage to his favorite records, but <i>Your Arsenal</i> comes off at first like an out-and-out glam rock pastiche—""glam rock"" defined, for these purposes, as ""Bowie plus T. Rex minus the strings"". <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80sbKxPXzKw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Glamorous Glue""</a> stomps like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGQo6zpVzt8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Jean Genie""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cvr3focVF0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Certain People I Know""</a> cops its guitar licks from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDAh19tms4U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ride a White Swan""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLOu3blVmhU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday""</a> winks so hard at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jg4ekLG9Zo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide""</a> that Bowie winked back, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnKvpOYbOJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covering it</a> a year later on <i>Black Tie White Noise</i>.</p>
<p>The homage that eventually emerges from <i>Your Arsenal</i>, though, is closer to home: it often sounds like Morrissey and Whyte (who co-wrote eight of its 10 songs) doing their best approximation of the Smiths. It's odd to intimate that someone would be imitating his own band, but really: there could have have been endless ways to arrange <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv1zy-7-PgE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Seasick, Yet Still Docked""</a> that didn't sound quite so much like the Smiths' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIyXJxPFVz4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""</a>, for instance. On <i>Viva Hate</i> and <i>Kill Uncle</i>, Morrissey had been demonstrating what his voice and his oddball sense of tune could do with collaborators who distinctly weren't Johnny Marr; this time, his band does their damnedest to recapture the old vibe.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that someone would be disgruntled with whatever Morrissey decided to do, and his habit of amplifying anything that annoys anyone means he's more <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMW_ROS94Kk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Morrisseyesque</a> than ever before here. That was great news for his singing—his tics are his glories—but it often blindsides his lyrics. Morrissey's commitment to ironizing everything including his own irony ends up undercutting any position he might be staking out. Hence <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFDzQD-LR80"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You're the One for Me, Fatty""</a>, whose hook's cleverness leaves him flailing for other utterances to follow it up with. Hence also the (more or less) trumped-up furor over ""The National Front Disco"": Morrissey is clearly declaring ""England for the English"" in great big quotation marks, especially considering that at the end of the previous track he's announced that ""we are the last truly British people you'll ever know""—nationalism pumped up until it disintegrates into meaninglessness—but all the kisses he's blown to creeps and thugs make it harder to swallow.</p>
<p>Morrissey can't resist ironizing his own team spirit, either, which leads straight to the album's best song and his solo career's best joke, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6g0gDrCUi8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful""</a>. (Egotists are always funnier when they can mock their own egotism.) Its ""we"" is a delicious bit of rhetoric—it presumes the listener's agreement—and so is the whiplash sequence of perspective shifts at the end: ""You see, it should've been me... Everybody says so."" And what is it that makes Morrissey's work <a href=""http://sisii2011.blogspot.com/2011/06/richard-hamilton-just-what-is-it-that.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">so different, so appealing</a>? He spells it out: ""Loads of songs/ So many songs... Verse/ Chorus/ Middle eight/ Break, fade."" Nobody else is doing <i>that</i>!</p>
<p>Naturally, Morrissey has now doubled down on the annoyance factor of his last few reissues by tinkering with the track listing of <i>Your Arsenal </i>a bit—""Tomorrow"" has been replaced by its American single mix. In lieu of a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uxP8h0SZRw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tacky badge</a>, this edition comes with a slightly muddy but passable live DVD filmed at California's Shoreline Amphitheatre in October, 1991, four months or so after the concert that became the <i>Live in Dallas</i> video. The only song it's got in common with the album is ""We Hate It..."", which was then still six months away from its appearance as <i>Your Arsenal</i>'s first single. The new band is solid, and they even work up a bit of rockabilly heat here and there, but nobody's threatening Morrissey's position as the captain of the team, so he's not particularly fighting for it.</p></div>"|18999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18999-morrissey-your-arsenal/|7.3|Douglas Wolk

And, not coincidentally, it’s also the most tired and clichéd mode of performance, one forever associated with egregiously earnest, coffeehouse-scented singer-songwriter hokum. As products of the post-millennial West Coast acid-folk insurgence, Ben Chasny and Donovan Quinn have spent a great deal of the past decade reinstating the acoustic guitar as an agent of experimentalism rather than sentimentalism: Under his nom de psych, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"">Six Organs of Admittance</a>, Chasny has amassed a formidable catalogue of string-and-mind-bending ragas, while Quinn has used his unplugged instrument as a springboard into more fantastical realms with the Skygreen Leopards. But now that they’re cracking open their guitar cases side-by-side as New Bums, the two present themselves with their most formidable challenge yet: to make something familiar—i.e., a low-key, classic-rock-inspired record—uniquely their own.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.sixorgans.com/?p=275"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">According to Chasny’s blog</a>, New Bums’ debut album has been in the works on-and-off for roughly five years, but <i>Voices in a Rented Room</i> sounds like it was written and recorded in about five hours, with one set of eyes on a watch and the other on the wallet. But that’s as much a comment on the album’s purity of vision and effortless execution as its scrappy, off-the-cuff vibe. Melodically, these 12 songs would fit more comfortably in Quinn’s canon than Chasny’s, though the latter’s experience <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntup6GzHZtw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covering old Gary Higgins obscurities</a> prepares him well for the sweet serenading required here. Rather than contrast their voices and personalities, <i>Voices in a Rented Room</i> presents its participants as a united front and, luckily, their harmonizing sounds a lot like a double-tracked Marc Bolan vocal. (The opening “Black Bough” will immediately endear itself to anyone whose favorite T. Rex song is “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCUIuCuzdII&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ballrooms of Mars</a>.”)</p>
<p>True to its title, <i>Voices in a Rented Room</i> is modestly scaled and simply structured; the tone and form established in a song’s first verse don’t change by the time we reach the third. But even within these confines, New Bums rarely retrace their steps: the beautifully dazed “Sometimes You Crash” sounds like something a strung-out Alex Chilton would have strummed out during a late-night session for Big Star’s <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>, whereas the busker boogie of “Your Bullshit” imagines an alternate 1990s where Royal Trux sold enough records for Virgin to get their own <i>MTV Unplugged</i> episode. But what makes this album special—and a highlight amid both principals’ sprawling discographies—is the way Chasny and Quinn offset their idyllic, campfire-ready accessibility with mellow-harshing irreverence. New Bums are ultimately a harmony duo that thrives on mischief and discord: pretty songs laden with cuss words, absurdist expressions of modern-bromance (“Your Girlfriend Might Be a Cop”), oblique references to those poor heshers who <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/17/arts/2-families-sue-heavy-metal-band-as-having-driven-sons-to-suicide.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shot themselves in the head</a> after listening to Judas Priest. On <i>Voices in a Rented Room</i>, Chasny and Quinn resemble not so much folk singers as punk pranksters who couldn’t afford to pay their electricity bill. Just call ’em Simon &amp; Garfuckoff. </p></div>"|19008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19008-new-bums-voices-in-a-rented-room/|7.6|Stuart Berman

<p>After R.E.M. dissolved in 2011, guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11611-peter-buck/"">Peter Buck</a> was quick out of the gate with his first solo album, which returned to those early influences to find fresh inspiration. He covered old bluesmen and wrote songs that sounded like they could have been pounded out in somebody’s garage ca. 1966. Rather than derivative, that album sounded loose and nervy, as thought he’d finally broken free of the best-band-in-the-world expectations that quashed so many of R.E.M.’s eccentricities in the 2000s. That he returns to this general sound for his follow-up, the immodestly titled <i>I Am Back to Blow Your Mind Once Again</i>, is no surprise at all. Nor is it unwelcome: Songs like the jittery rave-up “Monkey Mask” and the gangly jangle “My Slobbering Decline” bristle with the excitement of a kid staying up late to watch black-and-white monster movies on cable.</p>
<p>As a solo artist Buck has repeatedly signaled his willingness to indulge some of his weirder impulses, both musical and commercial. As with his debut, <i>I Am Back</i> will be released exclusively on vinyl, via Portland indie Mississippi Records. Again, he enlisted a small core of friends as his backing band: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14505-adam-selzer/"">Adam Selzer</a>, Scott McCaughey, and Bill Rieflin. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=corin+tucker&amp;min_year=1999&amp;max_year=2014"">Corin Tucker</a> returns for the murky country-goth ballad “Drown with Me”, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1183-drive-by-truckers/"">Drive-By Trucker</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2015-patterson-hood/"">Patterson Hood</a> narrates “Southerner” as Buck unleashes squalls of <i>Monster</i>-era feedback behind him. Both the solemnity of the piece and its  reliance on real-world details contrast the fantastical nature of much of Buck’s songwriting, with its nods to apes and aliens and parties, yet Hood’s sense of personal reminiscence reinforces the nostalgia that clearly motivates Buck’s solo material.</p>
<p><i>I Am Back</i> not only picks up where <i>Peter Buck</i> left off, but sounds like an extension of that album’s sessions and sensibility. Except that it’s better: more focused and funnier, although not so much better that it sounds polished or loses its DIY grit. Still wooly and weird, <i>I Am Back</i> shows a slightly stronger sense of the sideman’s strengths and weaknesses as a frontman. Buck does, in fact, seem like a creditable bandleader, almost like a newly zombified <a href=""http://youtu.be/xwNP9HOFvwQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sam the Sham</a>. Rather than write a bridge for “Monkey Mask”, he simply yells, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"">Sun Ra</a>!” and lets his band burst into some slapstick noise-rock. On the outro, he calls out Mighty Joe Young as “nothing but a fat man in an antiquated monkey suit. I’ll kick his ass.” In addition to making better use of the grit and grime in his bizarre voice, which is the definition of “acquired taste,” Buck enlarges his musical palette, not just writing lowdown blues-pop numbers that sound like covers but also driving the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">Ramones</a> to the beach on “Gotta Get Outta the House” and chasing two-headed dogs with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1356-roky-erickson/"">Roky Erickson</a> on “West of Sunset”.</p>
<p>Buck’s return to these early sounds as the template for future experiments is something of a—forgive the pun—perfect circle. <i>I Am Back </i>gives the impression of a man approaching everything with the enthusiasm of an adolescent, as though he had just heard <i>Ramones </i>and the Nightcrawlers’ “<a href=""http://youtu.be/0W0ywTb9GCU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Little Black Egg</a>” (which is all but quoteed in ""Fall on My Own Sword"") for the very first time. The album itself is far too loose, too modest, too personal, too fans-only to live up to its grandiose title, but perhaps it’s not Buck’s intention. Perhaps that’s only the music talking: old songs cropping up to blow Buck’s mind once again.</p></div>"|19059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19059-peter-buck-i-am-back-to-blow-your-mind-once-again/|7.1|Stephen M.
