    Lucky Dragons drop 'n' click a laptop collage that finds fleshiness through
    the layering of electro-acoustic sounds. <em>Widows</em>, a collection of 16 literal
    ""pieces,"" is at its best when approximating an Apple Store jamboree:
    guitar, fiddle, cello, percussion, and brass compliment the digital domain;
    some guy in the back tries to play a mouse like a singing saw; a kid turns an
    external hard drive into a washboard.</p><p>
    The Lucky Dragons moniker is plural, but besides guests and extra hands
    (there's tons of clapping), the ""band"" consists solely of Luke
    Fischbeck, an LA-based musician who attended Brown University's electronic
    music program. He's apparently been at this thing for years and sounds like he
    set to work after absorbing a steady diet of Electric Birds, Tape, Partch, and
    Jackie-O Motherfucker. You might snag a bit of the Books, but I'd rather
    liken what he does here to Tower Recordings, or something from that
    family tree; these particular 1s and 0s feel folk. At times his spirit/energy reminds me of some ghosts of Portland past like Bugskull or even Irving Klaw Trio.</p><p>
    But then, you could also pluck Animal Collective feathers here and there,
    like on the seven-minute ""The Sound Of Waves"". It could be heard, too,
    as a more tuneful take on the post-munchkin-core of Avey Tare &amp; Kria Brekkan. The
    helium sucking can be sweet in small doses, but carried across various tracks,
    Lucky Dragons' Quasimoto impression starts to fade, largely because what he's
    saying is incomprehensible...bring on <em>The Unseen</em>'s fatty rhymes, and
    we're engaged in a different narrative. Is it a self-help M83 fairytale? At one
    point a sped-up/kid voice says ""I can't do it"" and someone responds,
    ""Yes you can, it's easy."" Guess that could be read R.
    Kelly-style.
    </p>
<p>
    Though language is never entirely transcribed, certain recurrent tropes
    emerge, like mini-Greek Choruses: those aforementioned handclaps as a
    fancy-free joyousness (also barking and yipping), divergent song title couplets
    (""Summer Swans"" and ""Dark Falcon""), Yars Revenge swarms.
    The loveliest ellipses occur when cuts increase the duration of what came
    before, or fuck with what you've come to expect: A gurgle replaced by a pretty
    string swell; instead of porn, you download a real-life dulcimer and recorder
    duo; the little monster voices and toddler free jazz of ""V Pattern"" skips over to the melancholic ""Death Friends"". There are a
    number of facets to this. Fischbeck does have a lot going on-- it never feels
    like background or soundtrack music. 
    </p>
<p>
    That said, though Fischbeck keeps tapping at the ecstatic-- he somehow makes
    drums sound like pop rocks!-- he doesn't just let it flow. To be honest it's
    difficult to know if the entire record's supposed to be read as one sprawl. I'd
    like to think so. If not, most songs are shameless ADD nuggets: one track is 14
    seconds, four are under a minute, and each subdivides continually. Instead of
    diagramming each jump-cut, it's best to close your eyes and take it like a fan.
    As mentioned above, tracks are obviously meant to play off and with one another
    (i.e. the magisterial ""Peasantries"" and spazoid follow-up
    ""Pleasantries"") and I'm sure connections go even deeper. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, the record is not entirely satisfying. It can even be annoying. You
    want dude to hiccup Henry Flynt, or listen to Burning Stare Core... or something.
    His live shows receive high praise-- some sort of interactive Please Touch
    museum with audience participation and collaboration. To me, that seems like just the
    sort of endlessness <em>Widows</em> needs: songs moving from hand to hand,
    spiraling as long as the audience keeps the tools afloat. Even if Fischbeck
    doesn't nail that here, love that laptop music's currently offering the
    possibility.

    Floridian Ben Cooper is the one-man-band recording as Radical Face. He's
    also half of the Morr duo Electric President, a project
    focused on muted indie pop in the Postal Service vein that has come to define the
    label. But where Electric President continually reminds you of digital nature
    of the production, with its glitchy beats and cut-up instruments, Radical Face
    is where Cooper indulges his more trad songwriting ambitions. Though it is
    sequenced and computer-tweaked, this is folk-flavored indie rock for the Sufjan
    set, with banjo, accordion, and organ augmenting the central acoustic guitar.</p><p>
    Despite being a solo project with acoustic leanings, Radical Face is a much
    ""bigger"" album than the more electronic Electric President's 2006
    debut. Home studios being what they are these days, Cooper generally gets an
    impressively layered sound out of his array of instruments, and he structures
    his songs to show his production prowess in the most flattering light. When the
    forceful strums and clattering background percussion of ""Welcome
    Home""-- the melody reminds me a bit of Simon &amp; Garfunkel with less
    than half the vocal range-- turns around into the soaring wordless chorus, all
    available space is filled and the pang of longing feels real. During its even
    grander climax, the longer ""Glory"" squeezes in whistling, a
    multi-tracked Cooper doing three-part harmony, loads of acoustic and electric
    guitars, and bashing drums. When the overdriven guitar fades out after the
    final chord, it segues seamlessly into a vibraphone loop mixed with crackling
    vinyl (a recurring motif) and the light piano that opens ""Strangest
    Things"". The transitions and sequencing here seem carefully considered,
    with bits of field recordings and sampled voices carrying the mood from one
    song to the next.</p><p>
    Two problems present themselves. First, though the production is initially
    arresting, it begins to feel a bit flat and lifeless over the record's length.
    It's a setback similar to the one I encountered listening to Psapps <em>The Only
    Thing I Ever Wanted</em>, and may just be a personal aversion to a certain kind
    of forward leaning, TV-show-montage-ready mode of digital recording. While
    surface noise is non-existent, the dynamic range seems oddly pinched and the
    musical field indistinct. <em>Ghost</em>, in a purely sonic sense,<em> </em>is
    simply tiring to listen to.  
    </p>
<p>
    The second issue is more subjective still, and it has to do with Cooper's
    voice. He does what he can with his flat and nasal instrument, which is at
    times reminiscent of Dean Wareham with a head cold. He restricts his melodies
    to notes he can hit, and you can make compelling and even classic songs with
    such limitations (see Leonard Cohen's discography). But Cooper has the added
    handicap of a bland vocal personality. He certainly sounds sincere and
    occasionally even sweet, but mostly his singing is disconcertingly generic.
    Which is the sort of thing that will bother some and others, perhaps feeling
    empathy with the underdog, will be drawn to. From where I sit, his voice brings
    down what otherwise seems to be a promising album of reasonably catchy songs.

It's like they've been around a while,     even though their debut EP only came out last September. You might think of     Arab Strap's Aiden Moffett when hearing singer James Graham because he's got a     feel for concrete imagery and does nothing to hide his thick Scottish accent. Shoegaze     comes to mind because guitarist Andy MacFarlane favors billowy curtains of     white noise that dominate the sound field. And, as Pitchfork writer Marc Hogan     has already pointed out, the Twilight Sad     sometimes bring to mind U2, with their shared fondness for huge choruses that     occasionally verge on histrionic.</p>
<p>All that said, the Twilight Sad are pushing these     familiar elements in some unexpected and exciting directions. Graham may sound     a bit like Moffett but he doesn't sing about getting wrecked in the pub while     trying to forget. His focus is primarily the concerns of adolescence, and he     even narrows it down to a specific age. In the first line of the key track     ""That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy"", Graham sings     ""...14, and you know..."" and you want to stop him right there. (Fourteen. Yes, we know how awful it can be.) But what follows is a portrait of a miserable kid that's both touching and     cathartic. Graham sounds angry, with sarcastic barbs about a ""loving mother""     and a ""lovely home,"" but ""That Summer..."" is anything but a tantrum.     He's got about four different levels to his voice in the song, from a calm     articulation to a throat-shredding wail, but he's never so clouded by rage that     he forgets the details.</p>
<p>And the details are what make the track, and the album, so compelling. The song     titles suggest a writer trying to find the profound in the mundane, and in that     way they remind me a bit of the Clientele, even though the tone couldn't be     more different. There's lots of weather, elements like earth and fire. There     are train rides and long walks to nowhere that offer plenty of time to think.     ""Last Year's Rain Didn't Fall Quite So Hard"" reads one, and the structure, a canon of     Graham's multi-tracked voice swirling around a single piano chord that sounds     like the opening of the Velvet Underground's ""I'm Waiting for My     Man"", reflects the sadness streaked with hope. In ""Walking for Two     Hours"", Graham sings about being ""so far from home"" as bass     drum, crash cymbal, and guitar strums merge into a tightly coiled implosion     that drives the loneliness home.</p>
<p>The shifts in volume, though not exactly surprising, are crucial. Peter Katis and the band produced, and the sonic arc they construct tracks the lyrics beautifully. There's a ""big moment"" on most songs where the music gets ridiculously loud and the guitar distortion     crowds almost everything out. There is, of course, no trick in this sort of surge;     a couple clicks on a floor pedal is all it takes. But the Twilight Sad know how to use dynamic range to advance the plot.</p>
<p>With songs so direct and the     band's hearts on their sleeves, the music's debt to shoegaze only goes so far. Instead of     tying the overdriven fuzz to a blissed-out sense of surrender to noise, the Twilight Sad uses the guitar as another kind of yell.     The     instrumental title track closing the record touches on My Bloody     Valentine's ""glide"" guitar drone, but the almost martial drumming,     with the snare seemingly vibrated by the guitar amp, keeps the track intimate     and grounded. And when the band gets ethereal, it's in a loose, folky way, as with the braid     of ringing guitar sounding during the coda of ""Talking With Fireworks/ Here, It     Never Snowed."" Regular use of accordion, also played by     MacFarlane, imparts an appropriately street-level earthiness to the sound.</p>
<p>As exhilarating as <i>Fourteen Autumns </i>is at its most anthemic, the vividness of the lyrical themes ultimately carries the record over. If one were to consider only the widescreen sound while scanning the     titles, you might think the Twilight Sad were overwrought and sappy, another     example of a band overly concerned with childhood, too young to know how good     they really had it. But that's not the way these songs come across at all. The     Twilight Sad approach the darker side of growing up with consideration and dignity, and manage to     maintain a proper perspective. ""As my bones grew, they did hurt/ They hurt     really bad,"" an angst-filled songwriter from another generation once sang; the Twilight Sad do a tremendous job of remembering that ache.</p></div>"|10111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10111-fourteen-autumns-and-fifteen-winters/|8.6|Mark Richardson

    When Shearwater released <em>Palo Santo</em> in 2006, it wasn't simply a strong
    collection of moody folk songs. It was a stark, seductive, and mysterious
    crooked path through genres already tapped and exhausted in recent years,
    played as precious but still malleable in the hands of Okkervil River sideman
    Jonathan Meiburg and his band. It was a big leap for Shearwater, but more than that, it was
    a record that tapped into something intangible-- in this case a kind of backwoods atmosphere
    that's subtly creepy without any strain for authenticity. With the
    hiss of radio static, instruments whispering from deep within the mix,
    Meiburg's falsetto so gentle and lilting it was nearly inaudible at times, it
    felt more like a fog than an album in its gentler moments, yet had melodies so resilient
    they were startling in toothier tracks like ""White Waves"" or
    ""Red Sea, Black Sea"".</p><p>
    So they decided to fuck with it. Leaving the nest of Misra for the wide open
    skies made available by Matador, <em>Palo
    Santo</em> is re-released this year not only with bonus material, but fully
    re-recorded versions of five songs and a brand-new cover that's like a Maurice
    Sendak drawing of a vampire marshmallow Peep. From the beginning of this
    expanded edition, things have changed: Meiburg's falsetto is clear as a bell on
    opener ""La Dame et la Licorne"", intermittent chords on piano suddenly
    sparkle, and his wail of ""<em>Bring back
    my boy!""</em> is a sudden, stunning eyebrow-raiser rather than a strain to
    be heard. For better or for worse-- mostly better-- <em>Palo Santo</em> mk 2 is what these songs would sound like in a live
    setting: clearer compositions with sometimes subtle, occasionally suffocating arrangements.</p><p>
    And while it's got a little
    less of that lo-fi romance, it's hardly compromising Meiburg's vision. For all its quiet mystery,
    I no longer have to put my head next to the speaker to hear all of ""La Dame et
    la Licorne"", mixed far too quietly before. There are moments one might
    miss from the original, notably the ominous throb of keyboard under the banjo
    pluck of ""Red Sea, Black Sea"" now
    erased, which previously made the song for me. It now moves from calm to
    cacophonous in its final moments, rather than a sustaining tension throughout. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Red Sea"" is
    probably the most glaring change, whereas in the recut piano-driven tracks
    ""Seventy-Four, Seventy-Five"" and ""Johnny Viola"", they're
    simply clearer and crisper, have more audible bass and trumpet, a little more
    crunch from the guitars, or-- in the case of ""Seventy""-- more discernible dynamics during its
    Talk Talk-esque spells. What we're left with is being face-to-face with the song itself,
    not its atmosphere. ""Hail, Mary"" alone maybe tips its hand too much, with
    a new full-band heave that doesn't need the full stops to underline its
    slippery pre-chorus, though the following crescendo is a little more cathartic
    now without the Casio blurts from the original. 
    </p>
<p>
    The appendix EP offers a tantalizing look at what's to come in the cool, airy
    pluck of ""My Only Boy"", but barring a few ambient diversions, it's
    mostly what you'd expect-- folkier, mustier demos of the quieter moments of <em>Palo Santo</em>, songs that offer little
    revelation aside from the fact that a strong song sounds just as good when
    unplugged (or further unplugged). As a standalone EP it wouldn't work, but it's
    a thoughtful addendum, even if this new edition would be worth picking up even
    without it. The original Misra version remains worth seeking out if you haven't,
    but what made the record a huge step forward, changing Shearwater from side
    project to a ""real band,"" remains intact: an effortless plurality of
    mood that stands in stark contrast with their earlier records, less predictable
    instrumentation in songs like ""Red Sea, Black Sea"" or
    ""Failed Queen"", and the strength of Meiburg's voice. Most bands don't
    have this sort of chance, nor take it-- I imagine many would be afraid of
    jinxing what's an already successful record. But there's only so much you can
    do to foul up a song that works, and fixing what may or may not have been
    broken doesn't hurt <em>Palo Santo</em>. A
    great record simply got a notch or two greater.

    Around the time of his 1998 album <em>Rise Up! </em>Bobby Conn discussed his
    musical goals with the print zine <em>Puncture</em>. Paul McCartney's ""Live and Let
    Die"" inspired him, especially how each section was it's own thing-- first
    it's a piano ballad, then there's a little reggae section in the bridge. He
    hoped that one day his own catalog might serve as a complete history of Western
    pop in miniature, with every possible subgenre covered in at least part of one
    track.</p><p>
    You have to take everything a trickster like Conn says to an interviewer
    with a grain of salt, of course, but three full-lengths, a live album, and some
    EPs later, he's certainly covered a tremendous amount of ground. Conn's albums
    tend to orbit around a single theme lyrically-- wealth and success on <em>Golden
    Age</em>, the politics of fear in <em>The Homeland</em>-- but musically they
    usually jump from glam rock sleaze to show music pomp to pseudo-confessional
    singer/songwriter tenderness to classic rock boogie to soulful r&amp;b croon,
    often within a single song.</p><p>
    If Conn's bombastic turns and stylistic ping-ponging sounded daring and
    unusual in the late 1990s, when prog was lying dormant and Jim Steinman's name
    was still spoken through clenched teeth, it now seems perfectly normal. In this
    post-Fiery Furnaces age we expect our quirky and ambitious indie pop artists to
    play around with genre. So Conn's newest, <em>King for a Day</em>,
    is as restless as you'd expect, which makes it easier to enjoy as
    an album. Setting aside the element of surprise, we're left with a dozen widely
    varying songs about celebrity, ego, and the distorting effects of show
    business. 
    </p>
<p>
    While he approaches his subject with a typically smug edge befitting his
    over-the-top ""showman"" persona, Conn also cuts that quality with
    impressive wit and a ceaseless dedication to musical craft. This is a very big
    sounding record, sharply arranged for Conn's band the Glass Gypsies and
    assorted guests. The eight-minute opener ""Vanitas"" begins with a
    clear acoustic guitar pattern and vaguely Middle Eastern violin from Monica
    Boubou, but after some chanting the electric guitars kick in and all of a
    sudden everything is all rock'n'roll animal. The crunch continues as a phalanx
    of layered voices conjure images of <em>King Arthur on Ice</em>-levels of
    excess-- did I mention that the lyrics are in Latin? The first English we hear
    form Conn is the words ""I feel old-fashioned when we fuck in the
    dark"" on ""When the Money's Gone"", which follows the glorious
    opener without a pause. So we know he's still got a dirty mind and, with the
    song's bouncy melody and bumping little guitar riff, that he's still writing
    some catchy songs. 
    </p>
<p>
    Having spent his entire career thinking in concept album terms, Conn is by
    now a master of structure and pacing, as he weaves conventional songs that run
    the gamut with instrumentals (the marching and proggy ""A Glimpse of
    Paradise"") and spoken-word goofs (""Punch the Sky"", which seems
    to riff on Scientology). The falsetto-voiced ""Twenty One"" alludes to
    Philly-soul's proto-disco, while ""Love Let Me Down"" is jaunty,
    swinging baroque pop-- my wife walked in on the chorus and thought it might be
    Belle &amp; Sebastian. 
    </p>
<em>King
    for a Day </em>ranks with <em>Rise Up! </em>as Conn's best. Still, as
    good as the record sounds and as capably as he immerses himself in assorted
    flavors pop, there remains an odd sense of distance to Conn on record. Between
    his persona, his themes, the piles of instruments, and the thick arrangements,
    Conn's music is deliberately structured without a discernible center. There's
    nothing easy to grab onto. Which, viewed another way, is a strength. There
    seems little chance that Conn's music will ossify; his perpetual reinvention
    and undeniable talent suggest that he'll continue to make compelling records as
    long as the format still interests him. But for all their charms, his records
    are made for either quick infatuation or distant admiration; <em>King for a Day </em>is
    classic Conn, because it's hard to fall in love with.</div>"|10081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10081-king-for-a-day/|6.5|Mark Richardson

    ""This is Sarah Nixey talking,"" goes the opening line of
    Sarah Nixey's first solo album. It's not the most promising beginning, bringing
    to mind Bart Simspon's Al Gore doll that says, ""You are hearing me talk."" She
    goes on to talk about the record you're about to hear over a soundtrack that
    could just as well welcome you to Epcot as her debut solo album. Mercifully, most of the
    rest of the record is solid dance-pop rather than a running narration.</p><p>
    Nixey is best known as the voice of Black Box Recorder, a
    vessel for the morbid satirical musings of former Auteur Luke Haines and a
    strangely sensual foil for John Moore's minimal, plasticine musical
    environments. Haines' old Auteurs mate James Banbury is Nixey's primary partner
    in crime here, co-writing most of the album with her and providing the slinky
    Euro sound that permeates it. On her own, Nixey seems more concerned with
    making a genuine pop record than needling English society, though some of the
    archness of her band does rub off, especially in ""Beautiful Oblivion"", where
    she sets lines like, ""I see the good in everyone/ Believe in fate,"" against
    lines like, ""I lock the doors, stay at home all night long/ Keeping safe,""
    over an Annie-ish neo-disco groove.</p><p>
    One of the things I've always loved about Nixey's voice-- and
    one of the reasons she's perfect for Black Box Recorder-- is her utter
    Englishness. The thick accent, the deadpan delivery, the fortitude in the
    face of senselessness; it's all there whenever she opens her mouth to sing, and
    that poise works in her favor on the most upbeat material here. She sounds so
    in control over these pulsing beats it's almost unsettling, like she should
    maybe be losing her breath here. Nixey takes one of her best lyrical turns on
    ""The Collector"", which at first sounds like pretty standard trapped-in-a-web-of-love fare. But it slowly reveals itself to be a lyrical re-telling of the John Knowles book (later a Terence Stamp film) of the same name, about a man who catches butterflies,
    locking away their beauty behind glass, then decides to do the same with a woman. 
    </p>
<p>
    Where the album usually slips is when it strays too far from sinewy, shiny dance-pop. ""Hotel Room"" tries to get a little
    heavy with the formula, bringing in pentatonic riffs that only hobble the song
    and relying on a chorus that collapses under its would-be anthemic weight. ""Endless
    Circles"" is a ham-handed attempt to create an affirmation for re-starting your
    life that bogs down in a sung-spoke pre-chorus and doesn't get its chorus far
    enough off the ground for it to go anywhere. The album's slower back end is
    generally less electrifying than the early going, though the cover of the Human
    League's ""The Black Hit of Space"" that closes the record is enjoyable.

    Nixey proves she's a capable songwriter on her debut, even
    if it is an up-and-down affair. Her voice is as magnetic as ever on these
    songs, but when the music takes a step back, she doesn't make a big impact
    without Haines' biting wit behind her. I suspect most of her fans will find
    plenty to enjoy here, but Black Box Recorder is still the first place to hear
    her.

There's no sugarcoating it, <em>Luxury</em> fawned over the lo-fi pop genius of E6 artists, most notably Olivia Tremor Control, whose sound was mimicked here right down to the theremin. Of course, anyone aping E6 bands is actually aping the myriad touchstones that inspired them, and realizing this, Golden Ball aim higher on psych-pop's pecking order with <em>The Antique Barking Swirls of Dawn</em>, an album that cuts out the middle man and taps psych at its purest roots.</p><p>
    However, just because the band's now feeding off material that's higher on the musical food chain doesn't make them anything more than the likable parasites they were on their debut. The only difference here is that they switch up their styles at a much quicker pace than on <em>Luxury</em>, infusing the standard sun-splashed pop with shades of stoner rock and shoegaze. In an even more striking change, frontman David Chadwick no longer hides behind the Olivia Tremor Control-inspired vocal fuzz, instead featuring his voice very prominently in the foreground--and in high fidelity. If <em>Luxury</em>, which Chadwick recorded in the secluded woods of Pennsylvania, advertised hippie values at their most Emersonian, <em>Swirls of Dawn</em>, by comparison, sounds like a shaggy-haired band ready for their big-time ""Ed Sullivan"" closeup.</p><p>
    First single ""Signature Abstract"" flaunts previously unseen muscle and élan from the band, rocking out on a J<em>esus Christ Superstar</em> riff before delivering a chorus mantra (""dance for what on Earth we came for"") that would've sent any apostle shimmying. The newfound guitar bravado's no fluke, either. Opener ""Oxen Free"" kicks off the album with a spiky staccato lead guitar that's loaded with a dexterity and narrative force fit for the court of the crimson king. These prog tendencies come full circle on Baroque ballad ""Everlasting Abandon"", a brooding closer that tramples any flowery sentiments the rest of the album had built up with a stormy brew of tremulous strings, keyboards, and haunting vocal harmonies.
    </p><p>
    While stylistically Golden Ball take some risks and venture into uncharted territory, Chadwick's vocals lag behind, hardly up to the task. For one thing, his lyrics are impenetrable and often just stupid. ""Mermaids in Marmalade,"" by no means a standout track, stumbles over an extremely awkward opening verse: ""Remind calliope to find some other kinds of measures/ to qualify in majesty these kodachromatic azures/ Of this aldeberranean mermaid in marmalade."" Elsewhere, Chadwick sounds totally zonked out, languidly missing pitches or slipping completely into spoken word at inopportune times. <em>Luxury</em> hid these limitations with a lot of lo-fi psych tropes, but against the rawer, more candid backdrop of <em>Swirls</em>, Chadwick's stripped-down vocals blot out potential standout moments. As a songwriter, Chadwick's having a blast cutting and pasting his pet albums into unpretentious, variegated retro, but even an inherently sedated, drugged up genre like psych needs its share of killer hooks and showstopping moments. For now, Golden Ball's just honoring what they love by rote emulation, and that hand-me-down filtering keeps these songs from becoming more than a mere tip of the hat to psychedelic pop.

    In an interview last autumn, Jeremy Greenspan recalled how the Junior Boys were originally built to appeal to the particular tastes of a good friend. The band's initial jumpstart, he said, came from the simple notion to note the co-ordinates of that friend's favorite sounds and then try to make music that felt like it was somehow at the center of them all.  As band manifestos go, it's as reasonable as any other; it's more interesting to be adored by one than liked by many.</p><p>
    Informed in equal breaths by Japan, Scritti Politti, Depeche Mode, and Frank Sinatra, their second record-- last year's striking <em>So This Is Goodbye</em>-- had similarly refined co-ordinates. But beyond its melodies and sounds, something extra in its craft hinted at the makers' own studious ears; reflected in those 10 songs were the countless nights the duo spent discovering, shaping and re-assessing their own personal aesthetics.</p><p>
<em>Dead Horse</em> is <em>So This Is Goodbye</em>'s remix EP, and it lends further weight to the notion that Junior Boys are one of those rare bands that are in continuous conversation with the musical world around them. In contrast to most remix EPs, which are typically slapdash paste jobs highlighted by the gratuitous presence of a) Previously unknown labelmates, b) Significant others, or c) Serial remix whores (you know who you are), <em>Dead Horse</em> feels well thought -out, or even, depending on how generous you feel, lovingly arranged.
    </p>
<p>
    Five tracks feature here, and span across a nicely disparate group of remixers. Saddled with headline status, Hot Chip elect to slap a pair of oversized neon sunglasses on ""In The Morning"" by obscuring it in a scattershot barrage of toy sounds and woozy synth leads. Surprisingly, their goofiness offsets the song's icy timbres nicely-- maybe it's a point-counterpoint thing. Dancefloor translations from Tensnake and Carl Craig follow; an epic and fantastically dark recut of ""Like A Child"", Craig's remix has already generated loads of blog love, but it's Tensnake's ""FM"" that really stands out. Not as much as a remix as a dance-ready refit of the previously beatless closer ""FM"", it's a marvelously realized port of the Junior Boys' lullaby into Booka Shade/DJ T territory. Elsewhere, longtime friend Kode9 reps for the dubstep contingent with a virtually unrecognizable take on album opener ""Double Shadow"" (on which only the closest scrutiny uncovers traces of the source material), and the massively underrated ambient/noise artist Marsen Jules rounds things out by reclaiming ""FM"" for five minutes of echo chamber black magic.
    </p>
<p>
    Really, there's not much here to dislike. If the Junior Boys' relative lack of singles and <em>Dead Horse</em>'s self-effacing title is anything to go on, they've probably got some reservations about all the additional material that artists are expected to supplement and promote a record with.  Fortunately, <em>Dead Horse</em> hardly constitutes a hit to their quality control; if anything, it reminds us that sometimes greatness involves knowing when to lie back and listen. Most artists would do well to have these ears.<br/>

    The 23rd hexagram of the <em>I Ching</em> is commonly known as ""Splitting Apart"", the point in a cycle where upheaval and disintegration enters in. The number 23, heralded by many an occultist and rag-tag philosopher is often considered a magical number associated with change, the point in a series where new energy comes in to transform the pre-existing condition and change the trajectory. A pop example of these esoteric notions, sadly, may be beloved New York indie rockers Blonde Redhead's seventh full-length, <em>23</em>.</p><p>
    Ironically, this career-facelift will most likely be the album that catapults this band to the red carpet-- more record sales, more exposure, higher profile tours. But serious Redhead heads familiar with the band's past forward-thinking oeuvre of magical melancholy will most likely catch a wince-able whiff of disintegration. Somewhere underneath all the high-gloss, ornamental swirlies and lacquered doilies are haphazardly camouflaged well-written songs.</p><p>
    Essentially, <em>23</em> consists of simply tunes much in the vein of the international trio's high water mark, 2000's <em>Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons</em>, which found the once angularly screeching Sonic Youth/Unwound-worshiping post-no-wavers breathing deep and relaxing. The songs are similar to 2004's almost as good <em>Misery Is a Butterfly</em>, which took said gems of art-pop blueness, but draped them in heavy orchestration and flirted with an almost too-lush production. Consider <em>Butterfly</em> the unsubtle foreshadowing: Allegedly, somewhere during the course of the making of the self-produced <em>23</em>, Blonde Redhead got lost; unsure if their early mixes were going in the right direction the band brought in famed alterna-rock producer Alan Moulder (U2, Depeche Mode, My Bloody Valentine, Smashing Pumpkins) for a tune-up.
    </p>
<p>
    Whether the Pace twins-- Amedeo (voice-guitars) and Simone (drums)-- and foxy frontwoman Kazu Makino (voice-guitars) were already drifting toward overblown production before Moulder's involvement is unclear, but the producer's paws are everywhere. Take, for example, the title track ""23"" where seriously My Bloody Valentine–jonesing guitars and hypno whatzits whirl around Kazu's eyes-wide-shut ethereal unintelligible words, sounding like the coolest new shoegaze band on the block, but not the quirky subtle architects of wistfullness we've come to know and love. Another mistep would be ""The Dress"", where traceable stains of previous BR dance-y hanky panky (such as <em>Lemon</em>'s ""This Is Not"") gets mired in electro keyboard chirps and droning draft-in-the-brain synths. You can't blame a band for trying new things: ""Silently"" sounds like a beach-walking Blondie track with girl-group harmonies; ""Publisher"" takes a Police-like drum attack and the trio's trademark minor-chord guitar lines but pads them with odd electronica effluvium; and ""Top Ranking"" smooshes J-pop cutesiness against Tropicalia breeziness. And then there's ""Heroine"", with its honey-I-shrunk-Kazu-into-a-Buggles-song samba. Innovative? Sure, but when all the day-glo splatters, candy-coated swooshes, and chocolate waterfalls obscure the individualized songs underneath, what's the point? <em>23</em> coulda/shoulda been the album where Blonde Redhead added on that much needed new wing to their mansion of moody cool craftsmanship. But instead, constructed right in front, blocking the entire view of the ornate and majestic building they took over 13 years to build, is a garish warbly and weird Frank Gehry-esque monstrosity.

ADULT., being giant weirdos, are one of those bands who've done the opposite, getting progressively more strange and insular. The music on <em>Why Bother?</em> may not be leagues away from the shrieky, gothic electro-punk that's become their signature, but it <em>is</em> different, and it's definitely stranger: Suddenly ADULT. are coming to you from somewhere inside what would seem to be a giant tank of very cold water. These are the same blurting drum machines and scratchy bass lines, but they've gone a bit distant and woozy, with hazy reverb and detuned synths wobbling all around.</p><p>
    Well: Getting more accessible was always a long shot for an act this single-mindedly concerned with themes of discomfort, anxiety, and annoyance. That stuff isn't going anywhere, as a glance at the tracklist will confirm. The lead single is ""I Feel Worse When I'm with You"", a classically ADULT. barnstormer whose video depicts a day in the Adam Lee Miller/Nicola Kuperus household as a string of attempts to kill either themselves or one another; it's surrounded by tracks like ""You Don't Worry Enough"", ""Inclined to Vomit"", and ""Plagued by Fear."" Kuperus's imagination still focuses on nausea, weapons, panic attacks, poison, CPR, taxidermy, and those murder-mystery photographs of people who may be unconscious but are probably dead-- you know, typical Michigan stuff. Rest assured that they have some sense of humor/irony about these things, if not always as much as you'd like.</p><p>
    And this record backs off on the punk charge (and the goth affectations) to let that good-times creepshow just sit and simmer. ""Red Herring"" has Kuperus actually singing, melodically-- for the first time in a while-- as an eerie, clanging synth backing runs in place like a giant machine; same goes for the terrific ""Good Deeds"", whose tempo is actually so high that the whole thing winds up feeling ominously static. Elsewhere, ""Harvest"" is all industrial ambience, while two parts of something called ""The Importance of Being Folk"" serve as soundtrack music to a short film involving needlepoint, a rusty axe, and a hexagram. None of this, however, stops the band from delivering some of the deliciously grating, high-energy stuff fans expect: ""Inclined to Vomit"" is pure pound and screech, and ""You Don't Worry Enough"" unleashes some hesher-friendly fuzz bass for what feels like the closest ADULT. will ever get to cock rock.</p><p>
    Stranger and stranger, then, and yet we all still know what kind of world we're being invited into with each new ADULT. release: Slow or fast, clean or dirty, underwater or above ground, fans of nerves, paranoia, and the inability to speak will always get what's coming to them. It's a little disappointing that none of the band's stylistic shifts have let them bloom into much more, but as furrows for ploughing go, this one's still pretty fascinating, and still all theirs.</p></div>"|10077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10077-why-bother/|6.9|Nitsuh Abebe

    When Biggie once declared himself ""heartthrob never, black and ugly as ever,"" I thought for years he was saying ""fat"" instead of ""black."" The actual lyric is more pointed, bringing race and class into the mix of Big's offhand interrogation of the American ideal of ""sexy,"" but my mishearing makes the same basic point: This mountainous figure with a lazy eye and a bulldog's grimace was one of the most unlikely sex symbols of the 1990s, a ""fat motherfucker"" who could step to a chiseled god like Tupac Shakur. As anyone with crooked teeth or a paunch knows, self-possession, wit, and swagger count for a lot when you're looking for love.</p><p>
    And in the history of unlikely rapping sex symbols-- a few internet maniacs like John Darnielle aside-- Biggie is perhaps only rivaled by Winston Foster, a Jamaican dancehall deejay cursed with a name he flipped into a money-minting blessing. For Foster, born an albino in a country where that particular biological quirk drops you to the bottom of the social rung, any sort of stardom as a professional musician was going to come from a knowing novelty appeal and a dogged, talented persistence. Recording a string of early, pre-digital dancehall hits with a producer named Henry ""Junjo"" Lawes and his house band, the Roots Radics, Yellowman was the Biggie of his era: a gun-toting cocksman in a wide-brimmed hat who fit none of the usual images of a swaggering pop phenomenon. This gave him instant novelty appeal, but it was his immense natural skill that actually put him over the top. Being a fat dude in a body conscious society is one thing; Foster's audiences were first downright shocked and outraged-- and then delighted-- to hear a supposedly sexually-undesirable ""outcast"" rapping about wrecking pum pums and toting heat, leaning through Kingston in a big ol' Caddie.</p><p>
<em>Most Wanted</em> is a new Yellowman greatest hits collection from Greensleeves, and since the man never made a <em>Ready to Die</em>, it's an excellent point of entry to his mackadocious island aesthetic. But go in expecting Biggie's jump-up machine gun funk and you'll be surprised; these wobbly tracks-- 16 variations of drum, bass, and Yellowman's brags and boasts repeated with the metronomic surety of ""This Is Why I'm Hot""-- have the waist-winding sway of the best old school reggae. For dance tunes, Yellowman records sure are slow. Modern dancehall and soca bounces off the walls to a diet of, as one recent riddim put it, ""Red Bull and Guinness"". These are spliff-calmed, afternoon-nap-in-the-hammock grooves. (The inclusion of several six- or seven-minute 12"" mixes only accentuates the repetition, complete with occasionally patience-testing head-nodder instrumental outros.) And the Roots Radics craft rhythms like they're expert set designers commissioned by a theater company with enough money for two props and one spotlight. Yellowman's the star, and the music mostly stays out of his way on stage, save for some dub special effects or keyboard lighting tricks.
    </p>
<p>
    What made Yellowman that kind of star is his larger-than-life, chest-puffing, can-you-top-this, I-will-steal-your-woman-and-she'll-love-it shit-talking, ever more outlandish because he knew no one took him seriously to begin with. And so this is exceptionally dirty music sometimes. When he sings ""gimme the morning ride"" that ""slips and slides,"" he's not singing about a lazy country drive or a horseback ride across the beach. Not an enlightened or even classy dude-- but like Biggie's gangsta moll fidelity fantasies on ""Me and My Bitch"", though thankfully without the offer of paternal fellatio-- Yellow does dream about a ghetto domestic partnership where ""me cook the chicken and you cook the rice"" on ""Yellowman Getting Married"", even if his vision of martial bliss is less about hiding his guns from the cops and closer to that of his sly sex chat descendent Vybz Kartel. You know, picturing him and his lady in a tree, f-u-c-k-i-n-g.
    </p>
<p>
    But of all the words you could use to describe Yellowman's flow, ""nimble"" and ""inventive"" would be among the last; like most deejays of his early-80s era, he chats almost exclusively in a flat, mid-tempo monotone, heavy on the catch phrase, which stylistically makes him less like Biggie and more like the dapper snapper rappers of the dirty south. Like a Dem Franchize or D4L album, if exponentially wittier, <em>Most Wanted</em>'s minimalism gets a little exhausting by the end. And also like snap music, Yellowman's best tune is also his biggest hit, ""Zungguzungguzungguzeng"", and if you want to know if <em>Most Wanted</em> is for you, try chanting that alliterative run-on in your own best monotone for as long as you can stand it. It's the best because that hypnotic hook is the <em>most</em> hypnotic, and the beat is the deadliest, adding some fierce flashes of phased guitar without compromising the basic groove established at the record's opening. Everyone could use some of Yellow's rub-a-dub style in their life, but an hour or more might have you zungguzenging all the way to the loony bin. <em>Most Wanted</em> is the kind of album for which the phrase ""zoning out"" was invented.

Despite a self-appointed induction into ""The New Wave of Finnish Heavy Metal,"" Circle have actually dabbled in a wide range of sounds, including post-rock, prog, jazz, dub, and more. So holding the Finnish group to a single stylistic standard would be both unfair and pointless.</p>
<p>Still, it's hard not to be perplexed by the band's recent direction. They seem to have plucked out the sparser, mellower, and cheesier moments in their repertoire and strung them together, discarding the intriguing time-changes, rock-riff twists, and inverted metal clichés of previous efforts. On last year's double CD <i>Miljard </i>this skyward drift worked pretty well, since the group's dreamy ambience was grounded by a strong dose of open-ended improvisation.</p>
<p>Not so with <i>Tower</i>, a six-song instrumental album made in collaboration with Finnish electronic musician Mika Rintala, aka Verde. Here Circle takes their New Age tendencies to an extreme, and the results are uneventful and sometimes just boring. Sounding like too-stoned-to-stand 60s jammers, the band doles out repetitive, twinkling cycles of Fusion-ish jazz-rock. Each track starts with a lax loop and rarely budges or builds, resulting in predictable tunes that end where they started. At best, some moments evoke the Kraut hypnosis of Can or Amon Duul. But more often Circle come off as a weak approximation of the Doors playing Fusion.</p>
<p>The album's highlights occur on its first two tracks, ""Gerde"" and ""Gåttø"".  Both are more active than the rest; the latter particularly nudges forward due to rattling, propulsive percussion reminiscent of the No-Neck Blues Band's tribal explorations. Notice, though, how both titles start with ""G""-- so does every other track on <i>Tower</i>. That may be meant as a clever trope, but it's also an indicator of how little variety the album holds. Each tune uses the same narrow sonic palette (most noticeably an overly cool Manzarek-style organ tone), making it exceedingly hard to remember which track is which.</p>
<p>Maybe <i>Tower </i>works as background music, if such a thing can be said to ""work."" At least the album's mediocrity isn't particularly offensive or annoying. But when you're talking about a band with such a varied and stellar track record, that's depressingly faint praise.</p></div>"|10080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10080-tower-featuring-verde/|4.3|Marc Masters

Every member played second banana to their album's real star: the production. All the jagged guitars and nervous rhythms, even the astonishing reach and depth of singer Tunde Adebimpe's voice, were pulled back to make way for Dave Sitek's monolithic sound. To argue against <em>Return to Cookie Mountain</em> is to argue against the wind, the sea, a ten-pound hamburger; there's just no place to begin attacking it.</p><p>
    Now, in a curious but nonetheless welcome bit of co-branding, we have <em>Live at Amoeba Music</em> from the famed West Coast record store, featuring four songs from <em>Cookie Mountain</em> recorded during an in-store performance. I can't say that any of these songs better their studio versions, but, obvious as the point may be, these songs reveal a striking amount about TVOTR when stripped of their thick production and original context-- how they are indeed a capital-r Rock band, and what a weird one they are. Here, you can hear the band as a sum of its parts, without quite becoming more than that.</p><p>
    Seamless it's not: You can hear (even more) how indebted they are to David Bowie's experimental 70s work in the low, theatrical vocals, swinging, staccato guitars, and blurting horns of ""Blues From Down Here"", and in the more pronounced tribal rhythms in the final moments of ""Wash the Day Away"". It's an added bonus for those who think ""Wolf Like Me"" is the band's only rock performance, because this EP proves otherwise-- it's far from phoned in, with performances too spirited and too practiced and arranged to be dismissed as ""off-the-cuff."" That said, ""Wolf"" is the EP's most jagged track, its tempo sliding as Adebimpe strangles his lyrics like a dog with a shoe in its teeth. The track's half-speed bridge sounds even weirder with its placid keyboards and fluttering recorders. These elements seem a lot more incongruous on this recording, sure, but they demand that much more attention without the layers of their album counterparts.
    </p><p>
    While they're not so jarring they sink the momentum, nothing comes together quite like ""Province"" does. (It also features the single greatest dedication I've ever heard on disc, going out to ""Pucky and Wheezy and Potato...and Tiny Huck."") As the band begins, its members are suddenly distinct and discernible, between the unexpectedly melodic metronome pluck of Kyp Malone versus the distorted, Sitek's atmospheric touches (not to mention the wind chimes dangling from his guitar's headstock), plus its unpredictable bass drops and continued Bowie emulation in its vocals (which makes more sense here). But when its B-section hits, a more vicious and gothic grind comes from the guitars, pushing to the front while not overbearing the most discernible lyrical moment of the disc. 
    </p>
<p>
    And this is plenty. It's ridiculous to expect transcendence from an in-store performance, and the band acknowledge this with banter after ""Blues from Down Here"", as Adebimpe thanks the crowd and apologizes for distracting them from ""the many fine purchases you could be making."" With its severely limited run, this release couldn't tarnish their catalog even if it did disappoint. As is, these are fine performances that peel back the layers of the band's newest songs, intended for the very devoted and very curious.

    Being the best band on the planet at any point in a group's existence
    has its downsides; chiefly, unless you release nonstop masterpieces,
    you're bound to disappoint a few fans with heady memories of the old
    records. However, like most great bands, Boredoms/V∞redoms don't let expectations get in the way of their vision. Eight years after
    the last <em>Super Roots</em> EP, Eye (CDJ, turntable), Yoshimi (drums), ATR (drums) and Yojiro (yep, drums) deliver <em>SR9</em>,
    diving headfirst into an ocean of drums, voices, and cycles upon cycles
    of subtle rhythmic variation. There are few places to catch your breath during the 40-minute race
    through Eye's human turntable symphony, but since Rhys Chatham and minimalist
    composer <strong><a href=""http://www.jongibson.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jon Gibson</a></strong>
    get thanked upfront in the 40-page CD booklet, you can't say the
    band didn't forewarn of walls of repetition and tidal noise.</p><p>
    ""LIVWE!!"" is the lone track on <em>SR9</em>, and consists of music
    that should sound familiar to anyone who's seen recent V∞redoms shows,
    as the piece (or some variation thereupon) is a staple of the band's
    repertoire. Essentially, it consists of lengthy blocks of rhythmic
    patterns played by the drummers (similar to <em>Vision Creation Newsun</em>),
    but rather than radically change textures or beats in each section, Eye
    ties the entire piece together via vocal samples from his turntable,
    modulating them up or down to create ad hoc melodies. On <em>SR9</em> (taken from a 2004 live Christmas Eve performance), the samples have been arranged for a 24-piece choir-- the booklet contains the entire notated score-- and the effect of hearing them ride over the pound of three drummers can sometimes be angelic.</p><p>
    However, it can also be a bit monotonous. Over 40 minutes, despite
    generally clear transitions from pattern to pattern, the sonic range of
    choral parts is relatively small, and the actual harmonies being sung
    can be distractingly same-y-- which makes sense when you consider they
    were borne out of a single chord that was merely pitched up or down.
    Still, the drum-less (except for jingle bells) opening, with those magical
    major chords from the choir is heavenly, and the moment that the drums
    enter (after an obviously enthused audience reaction to the
    introduction) is one of those times I wish I could jump into the CD and
    see what all those people saw.
    </p>
<p>
    In truth, <strong><a href=""mailto:boretronix@earth.ocn.ne.jp"">V∞redoms</a></strong>' music is so relentlessly <em>positive</em>,
    so unafraid of galloping into the cosmic ether that it's hard not to
    like the record. About 12 minutes in, Eye leads a call-and-response
    just before the choir drops out and the drummers settle into a great,
    quasi Afro-Cuban pattern; it's the kind of thing that would send
    party-goers over the edge two minutes before midnight on New Year's
    Eve, because they know when everything gets quiet like that, something
    huge is just around the corner. <em>Super Roots 9</em> sounds like music for endlessly celebrating: It's a long ride, so prepare accordingly.

The Oakland band's tunes rarely last longer than two minutes, so opening with the relatively epic ""Center Where Sight"" could be seen as a kind of ""we're serious now"" statement. And <em>Wars</em> does turn out to be the most serious XBXRX record so far. Intricate structures, jazzy stop-starts, and dramatic crescendos all suggest a new level of craft from this caffeinated post-hardcore outfit.</p><p>
    This is still XBXRX though-- <em>Wars</em> is, after all, only 27 minutes long-- and the band's raging momentum and endless energy persist. No extended solos or instrumental wankoffs here; this is resolutely a slamming punk record, just a little less Black Flag and a little more Minutemen than before. Hurtling forward with no interest in subtlety or restraint, XBXRX's music is as exhausting to listen to as it must be to play. But <em>Wars</em> is a step forward for a band who crashed out of the gate as teenagers and shows no signs of burnout a decade later.</p><p>
    The best songs here push the group's frantic chops ahead without losing the essential noise-wall. The crushing pound of ""Freezing Water"" finds a mid-point between Lightning Bolt's robotic fury and the Jesus Lizard's dark drool.  ""Here to Ruin the Party"" sounds like an outtake from the Minutemen's <em>What Makes a Man Start Fires?</em>, as rubbery bass, slashing guitar, and cryptic slogans fly by at hardcore speed. The album's peak comes on ""Minds"", a proggy sprint filled with knife-sharp rhythms.</p><p>
    Despite the new twists and turns, XBXRX still have just a single gear, and the band's permanent fast-forward mode sometimes flattens what could be distinct peaks and valleys into a one-dimensional wash. Sonically, XBXRX's palette is similarly limited. The fiery vocals and jolting guitar rarely vary in tone, even when the songs seem to blatantly beg for it.  The result is an album that, at under a half-hour, still feels too long.</p><p>
    One exception to the band's loud-fast rules is closer ""Ear Ever Hear"", a more spacious piece whose disconnected riffs and sliced rhythms make the group sound like a baby Deerhoof.  That intriguing move bodes well for XBXRX's next step-- a purported ""experimental improvisation-based album""-- but there are enough new ideas throughout <em>Wars</em> to make the band worth watching, regardless of future plans.<br/></p></div>"|10074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10074-wars/|6.8|Marc Masters

Either mired in the true-school aesthetic of its
    Stateside progenitor or cowed into submission by the delinquent grit
    of grime, it's just never been a particularly interesting
    proposition. Fortunately, though, a few notable exceptions disprove the
    rule-- chief among them Infinite Livez. Where
    Britrap's stuffiest practitioners concern themselves
    with following a tradition of mildewed Transatlantic authenticity and
    the sound of London pirate radio reflects home-grown street life with
    rough-hewn aplomb but rarely looks any further than its own ends,
    this one-man lyrical sideshow has found a unique niche by keeping it
    surreal.</p><p>
    Trained at Chelsea College of Art &amp; Design and frequently appearing on
    stage with a glove-puppet alter ego named Barry Convex, Vinnie
    Tiefilz (as he likes to call himself in person) whiles away his time
    making improvised noise CDs, drawing, and sewing. Pretty obvious that
    he's not your average rapper-- and that's before
    even thinking about the bizarre imaginary worlds weaved in his choppy
    Cockney rhymes. Take, for instance, the stand-out moments from <em>Bush
    Meat</em>, his 2004 debut album. ""The Adventures of the
    Lactating Man"" tells the tale of an everyday Joe who suddenly
    finds himself the proud owner of a fully functioning set of breasts,
    while ""Pononee Girl"" offers a first-person account of a
    one-night stand with a My Little Pony toy. All told, it was quite the
    calling card-- a brilliantly realized, yet utterly demented
    collage of scatological wit and perverse fantasy.</p><p>
    Now Livez has found rhythms strange enough to match his rhymes, joining
    Swiss electronic improv duo Stade on <em>Art Brut Fe De Yoot</em>.
    Recorded on the fly, then subjected to as little subsequent editing
    as possible, it's an album as immediate as it is confounding.</p><p>
    Mixing occasionally soul
    crooning-- some great, some wildly and deliberately out-of-tune-- with abstract, spoken word raps, the vocals are run through
    sequences of effects or simply left to sprawl over Pierre Audétat and
    Christophe Calpini's dissonant, de-funked instrumentals. For
    the most part, it's a perfect fit, especially the scattershot,
    disjointed ""Unbiased Reductionism in 21<sup>st</sup> Century
    Music Practices"" and the beautifully titled ""Artyfartypartynazi"".
    However, the marriage is occasionally uneasy and directionless, as if
    the words need some semblance of normality to keep at least a toehold
    on the real world. Still, the points where it does fall apart (""The Taste of Jazz to Cum"") remain a small price to pay for a record as
    deliriously daft and unashamedly experimental as this.</p><p>
    That's what it's all about-- balance. As difficult and twisted as
    it may get, there's always a laugh to pull <em>Art Brut</em> back
    together. Packed with references to man-eating monsters, evil
    geniuses ""stroking pussies,"" talking kitchen appliances,
    and-- most gloriously-- the impact of diaper fetishism on a devotee's
    wife and family, it may be weird and crass, but there's a wry,
    streetwise quality to all the deviance, a mischievous joy in
    storytelling and a keen appreciation of the absurd. It's this
    that makes Livez so obviously English, many of his songs like
    sounding like overheard pub conversations from some parallel,
    Pythonesque universe. Endearingly eccentric, he's enough to
    make you think that all UK hip-hop should be made up of equal parts
    Kool Keith and Benny Hill.</p></div>"|10076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10076-art-brut-fe-de-yoot/|6.8|Dave Stelfox

    By this point in Dr. Dog's career, one can only assume that 1960s pop is so deeply embedded in the neural connectors of their collective brain that it's unwittingly marred the band's seven-year career. The group's latest record, <em>We All Belong</em>, is another collection of impressionistic déjà-vus-- easy guitar melodies and predictable rhythms thrust at us with no discernible amount of self-awareness.</p><p>
    Dr. Dog are due applause for putting on a good live show, where they
    showcase their throwback sound with flair, but that energy and charm doesn't frequently translate to their recorded content. The title track goes so far as to sound like a discarded Beatles track,
    complete with George Harrison's crackly, jarring guitar, Ringo Starr's dramatic,
    ear-boxing drums, distant ooh-wah vocal harmonies, and a Paul McCartney
    whine of a chorus. Except would the Beatles ever bring us a lyric as
    odious as ""We all belong""? (With ""All You Need Is Love"" they came close.)</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""My Old Ways"", fun track that it is, flits between the trebly vocals of the Shout Out Louds to the simple piano dalliances of Menomena's first album, but without either's more addictive qualities. Playful harmonies in the song's final minutes are subtly jarring and a departure from the strong, leaden, and pretty polyphonies of the Fab Four. ""The Way the Lazy Do"" affords us more of the messy, buzzing electric guitars popular in contemporary indie rock: the climbing, sadly triumphant chorus tricks us into thinking the melody will resolve, but the screeching keyboards keep it languorous and jarring until the close.</p><p>
    The tiny, joyous blues throwback ""Die, Die, Die"" captures our attention with a hyperbolic narrative about smoking, and here the vocals take on the humanistic, nakedly emotional delivery of a singer like Man Man's Honus Honus. ""Alaska"" is another more successful turn, as twinkling yet robust guitars mimic howling, porous, unintelligible vocals. If the influences are too glaring and the melodies too circuitous, Dr. Dog at least manages to sandwich heartfelt messages between their fleeting moments of originality, like the neat chaos of whistles and percussion in the dying minutes of ""Weekend"" and the surprisingly powerful rhythmic switch at the end of ""Ain't It Strange"".  Hold it by its edges and the experience of this album suffers–– the rocky center is where we find personal truths writ well.<br/>

    At 27, Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst already has enough career behind him to establish a trajectory. His rise has been uncannily similar to writer Dave Eggers': Both came under public scrutiny for self-conscious, ego-driven Artistic Statements-- Eggers with his meta-memoir <em>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</em>; Oberst with his meta-album <em>Fevers and Mirrors</em>. Soon after, both creators shifted focus to more worldly concerns, and have struggled ever since to imbue their work with the empathy and nuance that its often-political leanings demand. Both have heartfelt ambitions that frequently result in Holden Caulfield-like jabs at consumer culture, religion, and U.S. militarism. And both were generally more fun when they were hermetic.</p><p>
    As Oberst's lyrical themes broaden, his music is following suit. <em>Cassadaga, </em>taking its name from a spiritualist camp in Florida where
    Oberst spent some time, is a logical continuation of his evolution from haunted lo-fi auteur to country-folk traditionalist, and with it comes the slickest production of any Bright Eyes album to date. Oberst, while retaining the feverish quaver that's become his calling card, finds more mannered ways to express emotion here than sliding in and out of key. The arrangements are unapologetically grand, laden with strings, blaring guitar, and mournful pedal steel. Even the record's packaging seems to declare it an event-- the ""spectral decoder"" included with the disc translates the artwork's squiggly gray lines into all sorts of pictures and text.</p><p>
    The ambitious arrangements strike just the right balance on some songs: The orchestral work on old-fashioned ballad ""Make a Plan to Love Me"" never overburdens the song's pliant lilt, while the marching strings in the last verse of ""Hot Knives"", and the organs that eventually sweep in on the barren ""No One Would Riot for Less"", provide an acute sense of drama. They also allow Oberst to venture beyond his comfy trad-folk niche: Organic hand percussion, electric piano, and vibraphone bring a Middle Eastern influence to ""Coat Check Dream Song"" without crossing into caricature-- although the droning Arabic chant at the end comes uncomfortably close to the kind of world music-pillaging we've come to dread from our aging rock stars.
    </p>
<p>
<span class=""postbody"">Elsewhere, Oberst's arrangements overreach</span><span class=""postbody""></span><em></em>: ""Four Winds"", with its squealing guitars and fiddles, sounds like a honky-tonk version of ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"", and the otherwise affecting ""If the Brakeman Turns My Way"" is held back by its overwrought roots-rock chorus. And the smugness latent in some of the arrangements becomes overt in the problematic lyrics, which cast a shadow over even the best-sounding songs. If only that spectral decoder could reveal hidden depth in lines like, ""Heard loud and long the river's Om/ Time marching on to a madman's drum.""
    </p>
<p>
<span class=""postbody"">This balancing act between obscurity and directness is an attribute Bright Eyes fans are used to: </span>""Don't forget what you've learned, all you give is returned/ And if life seems absurd what you need is some laughter,"" which at least is an attribute Bright Eyes fans have become accustomed to. But the unbearable condescension masquerading as empathy in ""Soul Singer in a Session Band"" crosses a line: Does having ""a lengthy discussion on <em>The Power of Myth</em> with a postmodern author who didn't exist"" <em>really</em> make Oberst ""just like"" the soul singer in a session band? 
    </p>
<p>
    The political lyrics are the most troublesome. In his earlier efforts, Oberst was always hard on himself-- the problem is that he's adjusted his scope without adjusting his tone, and now he's just as hard on everyone else. In fact, he hardly appears in these songs, and the self-immolating advice he used to dispense (""Don't degrade yourself the way I do"") has given way to self-excluding left-wing boilerplate, all sound and no thunder. ""Clairaudients (Kill or Be Killed)"", one of several apocalyptically minded songs, gives us ""Get your revolution at a lower price""; elsewhere we get banner-wavers like ""Little soldier, little insect"" and ""the madness of the government"" that seem to be little more than applause signs. The anti-religion rocker ""Four Winds"" is particularly egregious, with its cursory references to great Satans, whores of Babylon, and slouching towards Bethlehem. 
    </p>
<p>
    Political art is necessary given the current world climate, but empty rhetoric and moral superiority aren't going to do the trick. The simplistic, self-righteous thinking that's at the root of today's political impasses is exactly the sort of thinking Oberst engages in here. This is a shame, because on the songs in which Oberst actually casts himself-- the subtle, lovely ""Lime Tree"", for instance, which is about loneliness and longing and everything he truly understands-- his musical gifts and emotional intelligence come to the fore. If he would address the political through this personal lens, exploring his own complicity in the military-industrial complex he currently lambastes from a false outside perspective, he might arrive at commentary that's more about insight and confrontation than moral flattery.

    On the surface, Brother Ali is a bruiser. His voice is blunt, his manner curt, and his point of reference planted in a gritty, urban life. But listen closer and you'll notice that he's a tortured soul, with a life that is meticulously and laboriously examined.  On ""Here"", the Minneapolis emcee confides, ""We dine here on a balanced diet/ Ego when it's loud/ Self-hatred when it's quiet."" And on much of <em>The Undisputed Truth</em>, things are very, very quiet.</p><p>
    Ali's focus on his inner landscape is the rapper's greatest asset and his biggest liability. There are times when his tales of personal disillusionment, righteous political anger, and emotional calamity are scarily realistic, but as often as not this obsession with his own emotions is incredibly megalomaniacal and incalculably boring. It isn't that his troubles are minor or tedious, it's that we don't entirely know his troubles-- only that he's troubled.</p><p>
    Ali does, however, deliver a hell of an opening punch with ""Whatcha' Got"". Churning power chords crash against a giant bass and restless snares, and Ant's beat bears more than a passing resemblance to Just Blaze's beat for Fat Joe's ""Safe to Say"". What the song lacks in originality it makes up for in sweaty bombast, and Ali is in loud/ego mode as he declares that the ""champion is back"" and spends three verse attacking rival rap crews. The bluster works, making this song among the strongest on the album.
    </p>
<p>
    But later the focus turns inward. ""The Puzzle"" finds him playing the part of a victim, musing that the constant struggles define him. It's the sort of idea best delivered by greasy gurus at self-improvement seminars, and everything here is mawkish self-definition or cliché. One minute he claims that he's ""tormented and tortured, and got nothing but gray hairs to show for it.""  The next he tells fans to keep their heads up and demands respect. He does let slip in the song's final verse that he's a single father and that he recently lost his mother to cancer – both reasonably interesting subjects-- but the details are limited.
    </p>
<p>
    And it isn't as if Ali doesn't know how to paint a picture or tell a story. The songs that concern themselves with specific incidents and have concrete settings are the set's strongest.  ""Lookin' At Me Sideways"" begins by taking aim at e-thugs-- the wanna-be gangstas who issue threats behind the anonymity of a screen name-- but that's a mere launching point for an amusing bout of self-definition. Here, Ali is ""a thugged out nerd,"" the sort of guy who eats ""organic vegetables mixed with fast food"" and claims he's somewhere between Howard Zinn and Howard Stern.
    </p>
<p>
    Ali honors the former on ""Letter from the Government"" when he takes aim at Bush's foreign policy misadventures. Over a slow, spare beat (the entire album is produced by the slick but derivative Atmosphere member Ant) Ali recounts opening a letter from the Army Reserves calling him to go to Iraq. His ""knuckles turn white/ Eyes begin bulging,"" and he sulks, remembering the ""blue sirens"" and abusive cops. ""What kind a sucker would I have to be after these years of you harassing and attacking me to go join the calvary?"" he asks. ""In the name of freedom, I'm supposed to one in his head?""
    </p>
<p>
    But what lies at the heart of Ali's malaise is his recent divorce, which he deals with head on in ""Walking Away"". The song is an open letter of sorts, with Ali directly addressing his ex. ""You're about to lose the company your misery loves,"" he says. Later he'll claim she tried to kill him, and that he never loved her and only stayed as long as he did for the kid. Ant's slow and slinky beat, with a whistle as its centerpiece, provides an effective juxtaposition and makes Ali's vile go down a little easier. It's a great track: honest, heartfelt, and (perhaps most importantly) very descriptive.

    shows, most of those happily barreling past the two-hour mark. They've released
    a half-dozen handmade EPs, too. Maddeningly creative and enthusiastically
    prolific, Akron/Family loves being a band.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Familyman Seth Olinsky made <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout</span><span>-- a 3xCD set recorded between fall 2004 and winter 2005-- with his first M-Box, a personal copy of ProTools, and a relaxed job
    at a new Brooklyn coffee shop. A/F was waiting for their first record to be
    released and for their first national tour. Almost three years ago, these 42
    songs let Olinsky occupy the interim. Then, on the eve of tour, he hurriedly
    pressed 25 CD-R copies. Two years later, two friends convinced him to let them
    remix the tapes-- 163 minutes of music, or a drop in the Akron bucket-- and package
    them as </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout</span><span>.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Indeed, it's important to remember that <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Sparrow </span><span>was never intended for release, let alone to serve as
    a solo statement from one of the brightest lights in American music.
    Instead, it's a humble set of songs, a very intimate collection from a Penn's
    Woods boy living life and making music in the big city, dealing with his
    relationship troubles and his acceptance of a finite role in an infinite cosmos
    through song. Olinsky builds a universe of ideas, undeveloped though they may
    be, and ensconces himself in the middle. Some of the guitar solos are misses,
    some of the lyrics are cutely obtuse, and some of the lo-fi production demands a
    second opinion. But, here, Olinsky is not worried with landing a single hook as
    much as he is experimenting with influences and inspirations: Elementary
    anecdotes and declarations (""You are the saddest turtle in the world,"" goes one
    gem) become Zen-shaped reflections on existence. Simple folk songs for acoustic
    guitar reach for the atmosphere, colored by the long-tone kaleidoscopic ideas
    of Terry Riley and the free improvisation influences of Derek Bailey and
    William Parker. Plaintive, image-rich confessionals come peppered with sketches
    (an early version of Akron anthem ""Blessing Force"" shows promise, if not
    development) for the harmonies that have become a Familial definition.</span>

    Prayer</span><span>, as both a wide-open musical
    experiment and a pragmatic coping mechanism. Love songs are met by damaged break-up
    blues, and those are surrounded by a Zen-like acquiescence to a broader
    reality. A five-track stretch on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Sparrow</span><span>, the third disc, encompasses all three modes: There's a song of
    despair, one of adoration and three of ecumenical considerations, including a
    reference to Shambala founder Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and the naturally
    damaging effects of a crowded world. On one track, Olinsky leads with three
    minutes of unresolved improvisation for guitar, percussion, organ and flute.
    They fade as he sings, ""I'm going to come to terms with what's going on"" 10
    times. As if to himself in a waking moment, he finally sings, ""And enjoy it."" <span> </span>Life isn't perfect, and-- as if by

    himself to sing <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">out</span><span> here. And if you've

    Whitman's ""Song of Myself."" On </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Sparrow Trout Heart Sprout</span><span>, he's riding instinct and trying to feel good about
    himself and his ideas. In a universe so big, buying in is always completely

    It's hard not to notice the Chalets' elaborately conceived packaging. The
    Dublin boy/girl quintet's leading ladies, singer/keyboardists Caiomhe
    ""Pony"" Derwin and Paula ""Pee Pee"" Cullen, make their own
    playful costumes. Their album artwork is airplane-themed, down to a pair of
    aviator sunglasses dangling from the pilot's shirt pocket that doubles as lyric
    sheet holder. Most rock's post-<em>Nevermind </em>austerity notwithstanding,
    stage presentations and album covers have long made up a meaningful part of pop
    fanhood.</p><p>
    The songs should still come first. The Chalets remember this guideline only
    infrequently on their debut album, <em>Check In</em>, which finally arrives on
    these shores nearly two years after receiving generally glowing notices abroad.
    The band's chunky guitar pop and shrill electro-punk does leave a short-lived
    sugar buzz now and then, but it often relies on heavy-handed writing about a
    stereotyped battle of the sexes. Yeah, kinda like that new sitcom on CBS.</p><p>
    Or, more frequently, <em>Grease</em>. Several tracks on <em>Check In </em>vie
    unsuccessfully to displace 1998's ""Grease Megamix"" as the most
    popular boy/girl karaoke song no boy ever picks. ""You're making us wanna
    unbuckle our trousers,"" the Chalets guys hoot over muted power chords on
    silly opener ""Theme from Chalets"", as the gals retort in cutesy B-52s
    harmony, ""You're making us wanna tighten our skirts."" The song's hook
    bears an uncanny resemblance to the one from Smash Mouth's ""Walkin' on the
    Sun"". On ""Love Punch"", the sexes fight it out with rape jokes
    and Presets-like synths, while ""Two Chord Song"" sees the lads joining
    a band with the ladies-- they quickly become vapid one-hit video stars. Not
    that easy, is it?
    </p>
<p>
<em>Check In </em>shows the most promise when the Chalets' male and female
    members all sing together, rather than apart. Simple new wave tune ""No
    Style"" achieves a California glow that helps more Mars v. Venus lyrics
    about ""staring at her ass"" pass as witty. To be sure, only a thin
    line separates this track or oddball hookup thriller ""Nightrocker""
    from more mediocre singles like the chugging ""Sexy Mistake"". Thing
    is, for all the focus on concept, the songs here frequently wind up sounding
    commercial-jingley rather than catchy, with lyrics more unremarkable than
    universal (""Everybody wants to feel the machine/ Everybody, yeah, you know
    what I mean""). Fans will obsess over packaging, but most of us have to
    fall in love with the music first.

    The All Music Guide says, cheerily, that Rosie Thomas ""wouldn't sound
    out of place spilling from the ceiling of an extremely popular coffee house
    chain."" Indeed, her fourth album, co-produced and with vocal and instrumental assistance from Sufjan Stevens, is full of the kind of basic
    strum-alongs and diaristic musings that yield showers of Starbucks praise. Such
    sleepy, easy folk albums as <em>These Friends of Mine</em> seem to be the
    incantation of some big retirement: from a job, from zest for life, from love,
    from creativity and insight, from nesting in any neighborhood coffee shop other
    than the obvious.</p><p>
    A song like ""Paper Doll"", a lazy, plucky,
    empty-room duet with the dull title metaphor at its center is not just
    background music, it's background thought, a self-indulgent bit of fluff.
    ""Kite Song"", similarly, is like a foolish, breezy blog entry. Instead
    of showcasing or exaggerating Thomas' vocal talent with heavy reverbing, the
    production only exposes the intentional cracks, assumedly meant to represent an
    emotion we should sympathize with or truly feel.</p><p>
    Thomas is a zealous close-talker who ironically discusses
    the private contents of her romantic life with utmost simplicity and either
    storybook metaphors or candid platitudes. Take the ridiculous cliché that
    somehow rises to the heights of emotional climax in ""Much Farther to
    Go"": ""I have much farther to go/ Everything is so predictable/ I
    should just click my heels together/ And go home/ But I'm not sure where that
    is anymore."" The setting of this song is a subway train to Brooklyn
    Heights, and the subject family, crying, Jesus, ""something about paper dolls,""
    and ""something about the cross."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Playing fan's advocate, one could say we are supposed
    to relate to this song's stream-of-consciousness tale of displacement and Oz, when
    really there could be nothing more dissatisfying than predictable, entry-level
    chord progressions following around shallow, first-draft thoughts. For such an
    experienced singer-songwriter to record and release such simplistic melodies,
    needless and jarring vocal effects, and déja-vu insights is surprising and
    negligible.
    </p>
    ""Songbird""
    is a perfect example of Thomas' ability to straddle two pop-folk musical
    philosophies and probably gain some sort of following for it: she wavers
    between the atmospheric swirls and croons of a singer like Sarah McLachlan and
    the utterly traditional, unfussy, but refreshingly virtuosic work of Lavender
    Diamond's Becky Stark. Thomas makes a case for both DIY acoustic work and odd
    vocal add-ons; the difference is that the two elements remain starkly at odds
    and that the material she writes recalls the above contemporaries only in
    style, not level of originality. The title track, a fun, lo-fi chorus round at
    the end of the album, is the only moment of enjoyment here: it's a quiet, sunny
    blues artifact that, while still superficial, still retains an element of
    novelty.</div>"|10049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10049-these-friends-of-mine/|3.8|Liz Colville

    circus, has been an unlikely paragon of routine. Not routine music, per se, but music made as part of a routine. Check in to the office, check out of
    the office. Repeat. Don't wait for your muse to come to you. Go to her first
    and demand she appear. Contrary to his reputation as a bit of a wild man, by
    his own account Cave's spent the past several years a man of
    discipline, with rules right down to what rules need be discarded, and when.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Grinderman, then, is Cave's considered decision to set aside
    those rules and make a sideways move into the realm of stripped down-- but far
    from mellow-- rock. Inspired by the creation of the most recent Bad Seeds
    release, <em>Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus</em>, Cave took his cohorts Warren
    Ellis, Martyn Casey, and Jim Sclavunos into the studio to slash and burn their
    way through new ideas until they'd amassed enough for an album. Unlike <em>Abattoir/Lyre</em> however, Cave kept the remaining Bad Seeds
    on the sidelines and, rather than flesh out the results, left them raw and
    stinging, setting aside his piano in favor of guitar.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    By doing so Cave has predictably invited comparisons to his first
    claim to fame, the Birthday Party-- and not without reason. Grinderman reveals
    Cave has rediscovered (or at least reembraced) the possibilities of
    the theatrical punk dirge, with arrangements that threaten to
    fly right off the rails.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But the Cave of the Birthday Party and the Cave of
    Grinderman are totally different beasts, and for that we can thank Cave's (yes)
    discipline-- as a writer, singer and as a bandleader. Grinderman are an indulgent
    study in excess, sure, but the twist is that at every turn Cave keeps the chaos
    carefully in check, emphasizing messiness when need be but also showcasing the
    deceptively precise playing of his band as well as his loose and at times
    gloriously silly lyrics.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The savage and snarling Birthday Party were as stark and
    nihilistic as the Bad Seeds are bombastic and apocalyptic, but Cave has never
    fully played the role of Prince of Darkness. As a songwriter he can be scary,
    moving, and intense, but thankfully Cave's rarely humorless. In fact, Cave's
    mirthfulness is one of his enduring gifts. He's the kind of guy who'll rhyme
    ""Orpheus"" with ""orifice"" not just because it's clever, but also because his
    inner Beavis &amp; Butthead finds it funny.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Grinderman may be intended as a somewhat goofy reassertion
    of punk vigor and virility, but the disc is no laughing matter. ""Get It On""
    starts the album in tease-mode, all build-up and no pay-off that nonetheless
    introduces the arsenal at hand: fuzzed out guitar, insistent rhythms, warts and
    all takes, oozing with animalistic sex and sleaze.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The many pleasures of ""No Pussy Blues"" have been praised for
    months, and rightly so: The song's hilarious, with Cave's pleas for sex grower
    stronger and stronger until he practically creams himself with indignation when
    his increasingly desperate romantic overtures go roundly rebuffed. It flirts with camp, especially
    with its typewriter intro, but who can complain when Cave and crew are clearly
    having so much fun?
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Songs like this show why Grinderman probably wouldn't
    have worked as a full-fledged Bad Seeds project. It's just too concertedly
    unhinged, and despite the modest ranks of the reduced band there's hardly any
    room for anything else. The title track is a thick slab of Gothic VU blues, as
    perverse and insidious as any of Cave's other character pieces, its tortured
    guitar coda like twisting metal. ""Go Tell the Women"" proudly takes the piss as it
    revels in its own primitive stupidity-- it's self-parody and salacious blues
    tribute all in one. ""Honey Bee (Let's Fly to Mars)"" is Cave and crew's stab at
    a woozy, wobbly garage stomper, like many of the other Grinderman songs both a
    call to arms and a come-on. ""Won't somebody touch me?"" Cave demands as the
    world falls apart around him.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The exceptions serve as little breathers, breaks from the
    onslaught.<span> </span>""Electric Alice"" is
    unlucky enough to follow ""No Pussy Blues"", so it would probably sound like a
    throw-away experiment in psychedelic loops and textures even it weren't a
    throw-away experiment in psychedelic loops and textures. The measured soul of
    ""(I Don't Need You to) Set Me Free"" and the familiar melodrama of ""Man in the
    Moon"" and ""When My Love Comes Down"" are prime Cave, but each marks a
    slight deviation from the Grinderman aesthetic. They're just a little too
    classy, too neat, despite the roaring undercurrent of musical violence in the
    last, which picks up right before the song cuts off. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    That leaves the somewhat anticlimactic ""Love Bomb"", nonetheless
    a much better approximation of the death of the 60s <em>fin de siecle</em> vibe than
    anything on the embarrassing Stooges reunion disc. Yes, the lyrics split the
    difference between 21<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px"">st</span> century Doors portent and Iggy's own current
    pop-culture citing missteps. The difference is that Cave's winking delivery
    implies he recognizes that dumb is just a state of mind, and he's more than
    willing to subsume his smarts for the sake of the music. By taking one for the team
    and donning a Stooge-worthy dunce cap, Cave in turn gives us so much more, and
    frees up is Id to wreak glorious havoc.

    The Rosebuds' 2003 debut, <em>The Rosebuds Make Out</em>, emerged within the small-but-noisy couplecore movement, situating the duo amongst Mates of State, Quasi, the White Stripes, and later, Matt &amp; Kim.  The thematic, and possibly autobiographical, trajectory of Ivan Howard and Kelly Crisp's records since, however, have set them a shade apart from their contemporaries.  Their two subsequent records-- including their latest and best release, <em>Night of the Furies</em>-- have collectively traced the path of a boy/girl relationship with rich detail and no shortage of passion.</p><p>
<em>Make Out</em>'s version of lust was colored with the silly joy of youthful infatuation; chipper and hooky, its organ-laden songs extolled the virtues of playgrounds, hanging out with friends, and kissing.  2005's <em>Birds Make Good Neighbors</em> followed its predecessor's frolicking with songs about adult responsibilities and building a life together.  The most appealing (and overlooked) aspect of <em>Neighbors</em>, however, was the melodramatic urgency the duo employed to elevate a set of songs about domesticity to the realm of a housebound <em>West Side Story</em>.  Songs like ""Outnumbered"", ""The Lovers' Rights"", and irresistable opener ""Hold Hands and Fight"" peppered their version of Paul and Linda's <em>McCartney</em> with pep-rally cheers and handclaps, all delivered with the playful fervency of a campfire singalong.  Settling down seldom sounds as much fun.</p><p>
    For its part, <em>Night of the Furies</em> retains the urgency and emotional mobilization of <em>Neighbors</em>, but with a darker edge.  The record chronicles the melodramatic relationship stage when misunderstandings and differences are fended off with an impassioned hope for a mutual future.  <em>Neighbors</em>' chants are back, but with a different, less playful tone.
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps the most significant weapon in Ivan and Kelly's arsenal this time around is their pallette.  The songs themselves are similar to, if not more emotionally and musically complex than, those on <em>Neighbors</em>, but they're presented with a stylistic left turn that in itself is an act of bravery.  The genre classification ""new romantic"" certainly wasn't coined to refer to musicians who themselves were experiencing a fresh relationship, but <em>Furies</em>' omnipresent (and indeed surprising) use of synthesizers, echoed vocals, and drum machines lend it a gravity and immediacy that it wears very well.  Different listeners will no doubt disagree on which synth-pop predecessor, or combination thereof, is the most fitting point of comparison-- there is definitely plenty of Pet Shop Boys, Roxy Music's <em>Avalon</em>, Duran Duran, New Order, Spandau Ballet, and Simple Minds on this record for days of deliberation-- but like Lansing-Dreiden's <em>The Dividing Island</em>, <em>Furies</em> is no retro-fetishistic pastiche.  The darkly drawn glamour of early 80s synth-pop is the perfect fit for this cinematically inclined collection of songs.</p><p>
<em>Furies</em> is well-sequenced, and bookended with its two finest songs.  On album-opener ""My Punishment for Fighting"" (the chorus of which is a sax-refrain away from ""Careless Whisper"", and this is not a bad thing), Howard alternates a dinner-club baritone on the verse with his more recognizable high-register croon on the chorus, as a percolating synth bubbles underneath, and lonely piano plinks mirror the lyrical regret of a man who has seemingly thrown in the towel:  ""I could never be all you need me to, my punishment is living without you.""  The title track that closes the record is its finest moment, however; a stark, poetic, tuxedoed lament masquerading as mythology.  A skittering, funky hi-hat and snare patter pecks at Howard's impeccably smooth tenor, which consistently echoes and interupts itself.  The idleness of a stable life have triggered uncomfortable recollections for him, and he intones: ""There's calm in these banquet years, so I tend to obsess about youth, before the guilt appeared.  But I need to forget.""</p><p>
    In between these two high points, Howard and Crisp navigate the choppy waters of romance with introspection, sentimentality, and barely restrained flamboyance, using Crisp's placid, hollow vocals to spooky effect. ""Cemetery Lawns"" is a great example of <em>Furies</em>' dark theatre, a raved-up battle emerging from a wedding gone wrong.  Crisp plays the role of the bloodied bride there, before turning paranoid on ""I Better Run"" and ""When the Lights Went Dim"" after realizing, respectively, that an expected inheritance from a relative might hold more trouble than it's worth, and that a lover may not have survived a mysterious calamity. </p><p>
    With <em>Night of the Furies</em>, the Rosebuds have cemented their knack for interpretation and their continued willingness to imaginatively explore all facets of romantic relationships.  Their two prior LPs progressed in the exaggerated manner of a dramatic serial, with each record increasing the emotional and creative stakes, and <em>Furies </em>feels like the culmination of an extended narrative.

    in part because they're said to derive from nature. No reference to Eulberg as
    a DJ/producer goes without mention of his also having worked as a park ranger,
    and what could be more novel than a German techno artist who talks about birds
    and trees when he's not busy being post-human?</p><p>
    It
    turns out that Eulberg's organic fancies are something of a <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">vorläufige
    Emissionsprospekte </span>(read:
    a ""red herring,"" at least as per Babel Fish). Those fancies have proven
    significant in the past, most notably on his fabled DJ mix <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Kreucht
    &amp; Fleucht</span>, which evoked a sense of growing, evolving, photosynthesizing, and so on. But
    nature's calls rarely figure into what Eulberg's own work actually
    communicates, even when they're supposed to.</p><p>
    It's
    not for lack of trying. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Heimische Gefilde</span>, a collection of 12-inches strung
    together as Eulberg's second artist album, features a host of spoken-word
    passages in which the producer meditates on nature like a figure from a
    scholastic filmstrip. (The album title translates as ""native habitat."") In one
    such passage, he talks about the <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">uhu </span>and mouths owl sounds to serve his subject. The
    owls are not what they seem, though, as per timeless wisdom gleaned from <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Twin
    Peaks.</span> Even
    when his muse is ostensibly a bird, Eulberg's method draws on a decidedly
    mechanical mix of clattering noises and whooshing trance effects writ large and
    small. It's what makes him simultaneously minimal and maximal-- and not the
    least bit natural in terms of style or sound. <span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: 18.6667px; font-style: italic""> </span>
</span>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span>
</p><p>
    The
    spoken-word bits prove nagging to an ear unschooled in German, but the music
    that separates them rubs a lot of different receptors elsewhere in the head.
    Indeed, Eulberg's is a uniquely <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">heady</span> kind of trance, in which stirring drama arises
    out of details made hectic down below. Tracks like ""Adler"" and ""Rote
    Waldameise"" run the kind of atmospheric smears and sirens you might hear in a
    super-club over rustling, fidgety rhythms mindful of a basement techno dive. In
    ""Die Alpenstrandläufer von Spiekeroog"" (that's ""the Alpine sandpipers of
    Spiekeroog""), Eulberg crafts a taut beat out of the wheezing sounds of industry
    more than anything winged. 
    </p>
<p>
    Eulberg
    is at his best when he's at his busiest-- as in ""Björn Borkenkäfer"" and ""Die
    Rotbauchunken vom Tegernsee"", tracks that cycle through a <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">musique concr</span><em>è</em><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">te</span> composer's bank of
    sounds in a manic rush. The beats shift to take in flurries of new percussive
    timbres, and Eulberg's trancey hand proves most deft when laying on
    swirling synths after the bulk of his work is already done. It's a
    technique that plays out in ""Harzer Roller"", a mesmerizing track that evokes
    the momentous glide of an airplane more than the flitting canary in its title.

    Ambition runs high on Ari Picker's first record as Lost in
    the Trees, a brief but intensely lush collection of seven songs that last just
    26 minutes yet still feels like a full-length album. Picker's projects all seem to
    have something big about them-- he's also in a band called the Never, who last

    illustrated by bandmate Noah Smith. On this one, the big things are the orchestrations.
    Though he's only working with a small group of musicians, including a string
    quartet, the final product sounds a lot larger, mostly thanks to studio
    trickery.</p><p>
    Opener ""Lost in the Snow"" begins with fractured
    programming soon joined by sweeping strings and a choral countermelody that's likely sampled or sequenced. It's a huge,
    ear-grabbing intro for a song that, once the vocals come in, is itself almost
    impossibly tiny-- just Picker's gentle tenor dueting with Jessica Smith's jazzy
    bass trombone. The vocal section almost feels like an interlude for the
    symphonic grandeur that surrounds it, and the coda returns the strings back before pulling away for a piano that embodies the winter theme of the lyrics.</p><p>
    The album isn't mixed continuously, but it has the feel of a
    suite because of the way Picker builds his songs from contrasting sections and
    keeps the sound consistent across the record. Consistency can work against an
    album, of course, but Picker gets around this by introducing alien textures
    into the sound at strategic points that immediately stand out for their
    otherness. For instance, ""Tall Trees"" kicks in with woodwinds riding a brisk,
    clipped beat, and then pulls the strings in around it, with a funky cello part
    underlying a very Vivaldi composition for the other strings. The woodwind
    texture flows into the next song, ""I've Always Loved the Fall"", which in turn
    splits open the center of the album (and its own pastoral atmosphere) with a
    decidedly ungodly church organ passage. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are a lot of influences at play here. ""If You're
    Afraid of the Dark"" is basically an ornate folk tune, replete with beautiful
    male/female harmonies, while ""For Elizabeth &amp; John"" could've wandered from
    a Carter Burwell or Mark Mothersbaugh score. Looking at the cover art, it seems
    pretty clear <em>Kid A</em>'s had at least a
    few spins in Picker's house, and you can hear the influence here and there in
    the electro-acoustic mix. 
    </p>
<p>
    Picker's ambition mostly pays off on <em>Time Taunts Me</em>, a very promising debut that seems stuffed with
    ideas. Picker has the talent, clearly-- his biggest shortcoming at this point is
    that his arrangements are often more memorable than the vocal meat of his
    songs. Even so, that's as much a reflection on how sharp those arrangements are
    as anything else, and this is ultimately a solid collection of orchestral indie
    pop from a guy with the potential to be very good indeed.

    In his breathless liner note blurb for Antipop Consortium's
    self-mythologizing, gallery-rap precursing 2000 debut <em>Tragic Epilogue</em>,
    Greg Tate referred to High Priest as having his ""aorta on his
    sleeve,"" quoting the lyric ""I'll play the part of the heart-torn
    rapper trying to reveal his feelings but lacking devices."" Priest's
    soul-searching tendencies were more often than not subsumed to the good of the
    Anti-Pop whole, though; in space, remember, no one can hear you scream. On his
    first solo record <em>Born Identity</em>, however, Priest makes sure the blood is
    flowing vigorously and unavoidably.</p><p>
<em>Identity</em>'s rhythmic backdrop doesn't sound too different from the
    Anti-Pop records. Producer Earl Blaize is back, and his ominous piano plinks,
    synth blasts and skittering drum machines come with him, surrounding Priest's
    uniquely shapeshifting timbre-- alternately resembling MF Doom's suspended
    placidity and Ghostface Killah's avant-soul croon-- as well as they ever have.
    The beats are still fun, but Priest's overstretched, occasionally
    cringe-inducing lyricism is the record's breaking point.</p><p>
    True to its title, Priest is set to establish himself as a socially
    conscious rapper on <em>Identity</em>; he's making neo-soul heavy on the
    ""neo"" and without traditional soul signifiers. This leads to
    introspective track titles like ""They Will Never See"" and
    ""Elevation"", the latter containing the phrase ""Can't say I never
    repped the hood,"" as if this record allowed him to check that off his list
    of career to-dos. ""Holla Atta General"" features a recurring
    omniscient voice intoning ""He knows just what's going down/ Expanding his
    consciousness to one more level,"" and ""Book of Keys"" features
    the eyebrow-raising boast ""I'm sorta like a young Ali, that means I'm
    sorta like a young Chuck D."" Ahem.
    </p>
<p>
    That Priest is confident of his skill and place in rap's pantheon shouldn't
    be surprising, but it's hard not to be taken aback by <em>Identity</em>'s
    constant tinfoil hat doomsday-raps, also known as unironic conspiracy
    theorizing. ""Pitfalls"", about returning war veterans, and
    ""Through the Fire"", about the government's response to Hurricane
    Katrina, come straight from the heart, but are pushed aside by, for instance,
    L.I.F.E. Long's verse on ""Karma Movements"", which imagines a
    post-apocalyptic America seemingly from the perspective of a crazy street
    corner doomsayer (yes, he does mention <em>12 Monkeys</em>). On ""American
    Prayer"", Priest vainly tries to remember a newspaper article; you know,
    the one about the government injecting mind-control fluid into unsuspecting
    citizens. Then he wastes ""Afro Horn""s skronky jungle sax by
    irresponsibly conflating police-related and gang/music industry-affiliated
    killings: ""They shot Amadou, they shot Amaru, let's not forget they shot
    the son of Mrs. Wallace, too.""
    </p>
<p>
    Priest began his career on Dan the Automator's space-rap vanity label 75
    Ark, responsible for the imaginatively dystopic conceptual visions of <em>Dr.
    Octagonycologist</em> and <em>Deltron 3030</em>. <em>Born Identity</em> is most
    certainly cut from the same sliver lamé cloth, but suffers under the weight of
    Priest's ultra-serious polemics, replacing his predecessors' darkly creative
    humor. It feels like a missed opportunity, not least because of the wasted,
    nearly anonymous TV on the Radio cameo on the album-closing instrumental
    non-entity ""Keep Time"". If Priest is to push forward with the
    well-intentioned post-art school pastiche he's begun with <em>Identity</em>--
    what Tate's blurb referred to as ""downtown avant-pop""-- he'd most
    definitely do well to take more than a passing glance at TVOTR's comparatively
    brilliant and seamless fusion.

    Music's impetus is much more complicated within a commercial framework than a traditional folk one, but one of its original functions-- to convey a heritage across time-- remains intact. The best evidence for this is how consistently the emergence of new tools for manipulating sound has been accompanied by a rush to standardize their use. John Cage noted that as soon as the theremin was invented, people started trying to replicate chamber music with it. A minority of guitarists explore the instrument's range of possibility; more crowd into the narrow province of rock. Software that has the potential to expand sound palettes is more often used in the service of conformity, rendering the mistake all but obsolete.</p><p>
    Those who choose to intone outside the lines are free to do so; but it's natural for the majority to work within genre restraints and it's interesting to see how the collective negotiation toward a standard unfolds, especially with the remix, which is still new enough for us to watch it happen in real time. The remix isn't determined by technology to any greater degree than other genres, but its tendencies sure can make it seem that way. When you think ""remix,"" despite the endless possibilities for rearranging sound, don't you immediately think ""dance?""</p><p>
    As such, the remix disc that comprises half of this encomium to Xiu Xiu's theatrical electro-pop is about what you'd expect: Mostly Xiu Xiu songs with more intricate drum patterns, glitchier melodies, and rushing synths. Not that the results can't be nice: Kid 606's thin-sliced version of ""Bishop, CA"" is masterfully dynamic. Gold Chains fashions ""Hello from Eau Claire"" into an itchy electro banger in the vein of Vitalic, recasting Caralee McElroy as an anomic club diva. This Song Is a Mess But So Am I does the exact same thing with ""Buzz Saw"". Son's ""Over Over"" opens with squalls that promise a harsh noise overhaul, but nope-- red herring; more gleaming beats. Xiu Xiu themselves gussy up ""Ceremony"" into a new wave jet crash, and To Live and Shave in L.A. trawl through the entirety of <em>The Air Force</em> to craft a dizzying IDM collage. 
    </p>
<p>
    If these efforts feel familiar, it's easy to understand why-- the beat-oriented remix is a proven formula for delivering thrills and chills, and the artists here who venture outside of it do so with mixed results. Warbucks' ""Suha"" is a tense piano ballad that actually pulls more resonance from Jamie Stewart's voice than the original's sputtering electro. Grouper stretches ""Tonite &amp; Today"" into the long, wispy drones they favor; one wonders if it would've been a better fit for the covers disc. The only outright dud is Cherry Point's ""Ale"", which simply pickles the song into a brine of distortion that's neither monstrous enough to be of interest on its own nor subtle enough to strike a compelling contrast to the source material. 
    </p>
<p>
    So the remix disc is pretty much just a shine job, but the superior covers disc is packed with surprises and interesting mutations; it has a stylistic broadness that's understandably absent from its companion. Part of its success stems from prudent artist choices-- Xiu Xiu collaborators like Larsen and Oxbow understand his idiom well enough to make it their own. The former plays ""Mousey Toy"" as bright, majestic post-rock with computer-generated vocals; the latter absorbs ""Saturn"" into his haunting, harrowing outsider-folk style. But beyond being enjoyable, the covers disc actually reveals something true about Xiu Xiu-- they aren't really, despite all the screaming and strident noises and ranting set pieces, experimental musicians. They aren't doing anything to music that scans as unnatural to Western listening habits. They're more like very, very idiosyncratic pop musicians, setting about the codification of their own superficially anarchic sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    If Xiu Xiu songs weren't rooted in pop, it wouldn't have been possible for Marisa Nadler to so seamlessly transform ""Clowne Towne"" into a folky hymn while retaining such a strong sense of the original, or for Sunset Rubdown to faithfully reproduce ""Apistat Commander"" in their own cosmic arena rock style. (Granted, it probably still would have been possible for Devendra Banhart to make ""Support Our Troops"" into a sort of mystical doo-wop, but that's just what he does.) Not all the covers hit the bullseye: The flimsiness of Her Space Holiday's piano-pop version of ""I Luv the Valley OH!"" is emphasized by the original's brawn, and Why?'s digital post-country doesn't do ""The Wig Master"" any favors. But they do draw out the immaculate melodic structures that lurk in the howling depths of most Xiu Xiu songs, coloring our perception of them like colored gels, while the remix disc is mostly strobe lights and smoke machines.

    rattling by Nathan Followill's crisp percussion, broken by passages
    of wall-like fuzz, you still have a minute left, and your doubts

    The post-<em>Is This It</em>
    homogenization of much UK
    guitar pop leaves recovering Britpop fans with a bit of a dilemma: Libertines-like barstool-rock or foppish post-punk moping? Surely not a choice you'd wish on even a critic. To our great relief, the debut albums from the Futureheads and Maxïmo
    Park stood out for their idea-crammed
    songs and sharp, catchy melodies, and Arctic Monkeys distinguish themselves through
    Alex Turner's vivid vernacular. South
    London's Good Shoes venture into this crowded market with a more streamlined
    pop take on new wave herky-jerky-- an earnest young Buzzcocks to their rivals'
    the Clash, the Jam, or XTC.</p><p>
    Good Shoes sweeten their spiky guitars, attack/release choruses, and hiccupping vocals with some
    straightforward songwriting about boys in bands (and the girls who love them). If
    the Arctic Monkeys' success established a new template for UK teen idoldom--
    realistic diaries of underage drinking and nervous romantic conquests, easy
    on the synths plz-- then Good Shoes paint between the same lines with broader
    brushstrokes. Extra polish on debut full-length <em>Think Before You Speak</em> helps this group of barely twentysomethings
    realize the promise shown in about two years' worth of 7""s, EPs, and
    demos.</p><p>
    Still fundamentally a singles band, Good Shoes give us plenty
    of potential iPod-commercial fodder here. Rickety pop-punker ""The Photos on My
    Wall"" laments a stupid mouth before breaking into a stylish, Orange Juice-hued
    midsection. ""My ears are ringing from the night before,"" singer/guitarist Rhys Jones notes, a detail his intended audience can no doubt appreciate. Jones remains an
    apologetic heartbreaker on ""Never Meant to Hurt You"", perhaps the best
    (only?) song ever to name-check fluffy J-Lo fable <em>Maid in Manhattan</em>. ""Small
    Town Girl"", a 2005 single re-recorded
    for the album, tries to comfort another Hollywood
    actress with catchy shouts and simple lead guitar. The bickering couple of
    ""We Are Not the Same"" is another easy entry point, though the title
    comes across as wishful thinking. 
    </p>
<p>
    Pleasant surprise: Several album tracks sound like
    potential singles, too. Likely live favorite ""Sophia"" (""all the
    pretty girls are screaming, 'Take off your pants!'"") again evokes the
    Arctics with its mention of our underage narrator being tossed from a bar,
    while ""Everybody's Talking"" enthusiastically tries out the
    Futureheads' call-and-response guitar intricacies. ""Does it really matter?"" Jones calls
    at the track's glowing conclusion. As welcome as new sounds would be,
    Good Shoes at least clean up the old ones for potentially new ears. Whatever, somewhere
    Art Brut are probably sticking out their tongues at the whole scene.

On tracks like Beanie Sigel's ""One Shot Deal"" and Ghostface's ""Greedy Bitches"", he blasts in like a hurricane, throwing punchlines haphazardly in all directions and cutting through all the hard exteriors around him with his id-driven insanity. It's the role he's played for more than 15 years, ever since he first came to prominence as a member of EPMD's Hit Squad. During New York hip-hop's late-90s jiggy era, he could deflate the self-seriousness of the rappers around him with a single uproarious non <span class=""postbody"">sequitur;</span> I'll always fondly remember the episode of ""MTV Cribs"" where he showed off his bombed-out crash-pad in all its disgusting glory.</p><p>
    Red's released six solo albums since 1992. Every one of them is inconsistent and overlong, but all of them boast more than enough moments of delirious anarchy to redeem any excesses. Even <em>Malpractice</em>, his justly maligned 2001 album, had the sublimely dumb ""Smash Sumthin'"" working for it. <em>Red Gone Wild</em>, his first new album since <em>Malpractice</em>, is only now seeing the light of day after years of delays. So it's hard not to greet it with a mixture of relief and dread. As great as it is to see Red releasing new material, the album feels like it's been sitting in a vault somewhere since 1998, and there's something profoundly depressing about that.</p><p>
    On one hand, Red's consistency is admirable. He's still working with the same gang of knuckleheads, even if the commercial rap world has long passed them by. Longtime producer Rockwilder turns in a few tracks, as does mentor Erick Sermon. ""Walk in Gutta"" reunites Red with his Def Squad crew, even making sure to include part-time member Biz Markie, and Method Man shows up on ""Blow Treez"". Characters from past albums' skits return. Also still evident: Red's endless, cartoonish appetite for weed, nasty sex, and borderline-nonsensical jokes: ""For that paper, I'm offending neighbors/ Running my label out of old Winnebago.""</p><p>
    But honestly, <em>Red Gone Wild</em> wouldn't have worked even in 1998. The album doesn't have any of the euphorically propulsive standout tracks that held Redman's older albums together. The first single, the propulsive Timbaland-produced club-track ""Put It Down"", comes closest, but none of Red's lines quite find their mark. Throughout the record, Red continues to manically spill nutty, energetic nonsense over clunky, dated keyboard-driven tracks, and it almost feels as though Red's afraid to push himself outside his comfort zone and try anything else. Even his pop-culture references are dated: Joe Piscopo, Teena Marie, Rodney Dangerfield's <em>Back to School</em>, ""getting head on my couch from a chick that resemble Rosie Perez in the mouth."" It's as if weed has kept him from remembering anything he's seen on TV since 1989. </p><p>
    Redman also wastes prodigious album-time on his thoroughly undistinguished Gilla House crew, all of whom either unsuccessfully ape Red's blown-out comedy or offer up the sort of oppressively boring straight-faced thug boilerplate that Red always avoided himself. Even without those Gilla House appearances, though, <em>Red Gone Wild</em> only comes alive in quick, tantalizing bursts, never cohering into a whole or even convincingly evoking past glories. And that's a shame; Redman is way too lively a rapper to put his name on a product as anemic as this. If there's any justice in the world, Def Jam won't force him to wait six years before he gets another shot.</p></div>"|10060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10060-red-gone-wild/|5.5|Tom Breihan

    eerie outer-space touch (as invoked by someone like Daniel Lanois) than it is a
    predictable alt-country accoutrement.</p><p>
    It's not Americana that Last Town Chorus call up, though.
    It's singers and writers like Tanya Donnelly who have in the past used
    atmosphere to play up what they believe to be their attributes. In Hickey's
    case it's an excuse to keep her voice opiate-mellow and the songs almost
    skeletal in their simplicity. The weirder touches that liven up ""Caroline"",
    ""Wintering in Brooklyn"", and ""It's Not Over"" are subtle-- like the latter two's
    twisted circular guitar solos-- and<span>
</span>mostly underscore the band's decision to stay safely within its comfort
    zone.</p><p>
    And yet these songs show Hickey to be a strong writer, albeit one hampered by her adherence
    to a dead-end aesthetic. The nostalgia-trip ""Huntsville, 1989"" turns Hickey's
    perpetual wistfulness to her advantage as she recalls lost loves, listening to
    the Smiths at bedtime, and trying to fit in on the outside. ""Alabama, '89/ I
    found the kids with boots like mine,"" she sings, sounding far less precious than she could have. It's a beautiful highlight of
    the disc if only because very little else (aside from the Bowie) truly sticks
    out.</p><p>
    Part of it may be strategic. If you make your music sleepy
    on purpose, that cushions complaints from listeners that it puts them to sleep.
    Indeed, <em>Wire Waltz</em> works wonderfully as a late-night salve,<span> </span>not so much soothing as it is negating.
    It's music to put on when you want to forget the world around you for a while.
    Unfortunately, for all its class and mystery, <em>Wire Waltz</em> erases itself in the
    process, leaving behind more a sense of mood than anything worth remembering.
    It's all awfully pretty, but sometimes prettiness is more potent when there's a
    little bit of ugly in there, too.</p></div>"|10057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10057-wire-waltz/|6.2|Joshua Klein

So you may be surprised to learn that <em>Score</em> is just that, a collection of music Herbert penned for a series of independent films from 1997 to 2007. Come to it expecting the man's usual mix of <em>musique concrète</em>-style sampling, torch songs, and leftist politicking, and you might walk away disappointed. On the other hand, I thought the photo of a collapsed house on the back cover was just Herbert punning on this album's lack of beats, until I noticed in the credits that it's taken from post-July War Lebanon in 2006. No matter the venue, Herbert can't resist a little social commentary, even subtly.</p><p>
<em>Score</em> is more in line with <em>Goodbye Swingtime</em>, Herbert's somewhat unfairly maligned big band jazz album from 2003, albeit minus the guest singers that were there to liven up what was otherwise a very faithful, if somewhat arch, homage to the swing era. Since the music on <em>Score</em> both pre- and post-dates <em>Goodbye Swingtime</em>, it's clear that jazz has long been an abiding interest for Herbert. (Of course, that was also more than evident from his house singles.) His métier here is post-war Rat Pack vehicles and Cold War thrillers, their scores a mix of then-current cocky American jazz cool and a continental European black market intrigue and lovelorn post-Luftwaffe ennui. ""Café de Flore (Trio Reprise)"" is an accordion-led sketch of a Parisian cobblestone square, and ""Rivoli Shuffle"", a nimble dance for piano and brass, is the spitting musical image of a two-bit, card-shuffling hustler in a cheap sharkskin suit. Herbert's musical research into the era means his orchestral jazz is certainly competent, but often the album is at its best on tracks like the analogue Aphex Twin wistfulness of ""End"" and album opener ""Funereal,"" a mournful miniature for strings that does a fine job of evoking a rain soaked graveyard--just right for opening or ending your film noir.</p><p>
    At 10:29, ""Rendezvous"" is both the album's most ambitious and most idiosyncratic piece of music. A barely audible ambient burbling of a beat lurks in the background throughout, topped with full-on choral writing for a male and female ensemble that shifts unexpectedly into tense moments of constricted techno, like a high Catholic mass suddenly breaking into a Clear Records 12-inch. The album's low point is a 2001 take on ""Singin' in the Rain"", fine as a muted instrumental jazz reading of the cinematic chestnut but made silly by the buzzes, hums, and glitch-y CD skips and stutters that Herbert adds as window-dressing. It's like a Hollywood agent's idea of ""futuristic jazz."" On the other hand, the guitar of ""Blood and Hair"", likewise poked and prodded with his computer, is flush with enough Galouises smoke and digital unease to suggest it might be a good choice for a modern remake of <em>The Third Man</em>. (Note to Hollywood: Please don't remake <em>The Third Man</em>. You'd probably cast Vince Vaughn as Harry Lime or something.)</p><p>
    Like 1996's <em>100 Lbs.</em>, reissued last year, <em>Score</em> will be something of a curio to anyone who hasn't already swallowed the Herbert kool-aid or who isn't a already a ravenous consumer of soundtracks and scores. Unlike the bump-and-flicker of Herbert's earliest deep house singles collected on <em>100 Lbs.</em>, however, <em>Score</em> won't even satisfy the beat heads, though if you were an enterprising, Ableton-owning mp3jay, you could edit the two together and probably get something close to the man's more recent albums, where the slickly realized jazz pastiches and Nelson Riddle-on-a-Tescos-budget strings are deployed as part of Herbert's lush dance grooves. But though we may yet learn that these seemingly straightforward set-pieces and pretty musical backdrops are actually made not from actual strings but from Herbert sampling a duck's quacks or the shouts of an anti-war demonstration, <em>Score</em> is perhaps the least conceptual, most functional thing the man has ever put his name to. Maybe rent the flicks first.</p></div>"|10071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10071-score/|6.7|Jess Harvell

    But instead of being spit out by a populace growing bored with gung-ho rhythms and the
    word ""angular,"" the Newcastle
    quintet more than held their own with 2005's <em>A Certain Trigger</em>, a burst of
    treble-rock so taut it made Franz Ferdinand sound Funkadelic. Now, with their competition slumping slightly, there's
    an opportunity for Maxïmo Park to start setting trends themselves. Did they take advantage? Well...no. Much like
    their cohorts, the group strives for grander statements with their sophomore album by enlisting a mainstream producer and offering-up more midtempo fare. In comparison, it makes their debut LP come off like a youthful demo. And-- much
    like their cohorts-- some of the band's winsome scrappiness is lost in
    transition.</p><p>
    Compressed into a rumbling guitar-rock fastball, <em>A Certain Trigger</em>
    was marked by Epworth's zoomed-in production. Along with its hairpin
    songwriting, that record captured a one-take candidness-- you could hear
    bug-eyed lead singer Paul Smith deliberately inhale before rattling off a manic
    melody at the top of ""Now I'm All Over the Shop"". <em>Our Earthly Pleasures</em>' sound is
    more calculating and broad-- and it clashes with the band's spitfire inclinations.</p><p>
    A catalyst behind this change is producer Gil Norton, who worked the boards on the Pixies' 1989 classic <em>Doolittle</em> and, more
    recently, eponymous albums from Ben Kweller and Morningwood. Although Smith
    claims, ""The gaps between words are the things that really intrigue me/
    It's the gasps and the sighs that say more about what's inside you,"" on
    opener ""Girls Who Play Guitars,"" such incidental sonic perks are
    largely excised in favor of a more commercial, gap-less sheen. Whereas lesser tracks on <em>A Certain Trigger</em> were rendered passable partially thanks to Epworth's condensed
    attack, <em>Our Earth Pleasures</em> duds like ""Your Urge"" (which introduces
    itself with Billy Joel-style piano flourishes) and normalized modern rocker
    ""Sandblasted and Set Free"" are done-in by the record's spic-and-span
    treatment. Even when the new style seems to work, as on the Devo-meets-Nirvana
    first single ""<strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWwBkA0GqaY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Our Velocity</a></strong>"", recent live versions of the song-- including <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TeBPSpwiCg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one on ""Top of the Pops""</a></strong>-- blow
    away the recorded take. Questionable studio decisions aside, Maxïmo Park have at least one distinct advantage
    over their Brit brethren: the desperate intensity of howler Paul Smith.
    </p><p>
    His guileless Geordie accent intact, Smith may be the most
    likeable frontman among his immediate contemporaries (sorry, Kele). He's
    traded-in the signature comb-over for a sharp bowler hat, but the spastic
    singer is still neurotically consumed by unfulfilling relationships. On early
    single ""Apply More Pressure"", he sang, ""I hope that I will live
    to see you undress,"" to a potential partner. But now that he's seen her
    naked, it seems, she's gone away. 
    </p>
<p>
    From the ominous unpacking tale ""Books From Boxes""
    (""You have to leave, I appreciate that/ But I hate when conversation slips
    out of our grasp"") to the anxious aftermath of ""By the Monument""
    (""Posterity has hold of us now/ Am I just waiting for the next
    chapter?"") to the <em>Before Sunset</em> nostalgia of ""Parisian Skies""
    (""I don't think she knew how much I loved her""), Smith chronicles a
    particularly harsh long-distance split in a style that's part Stipe-ian oblique
    and part emo confessional. He's prone to the occasional distracting Word of the Day
    (""I wonder how we tessellate/ It would have been much wiser to allow these
    feelings to abate,"" he enunciates on ""Your Urge"") and his flashes of
    Cocker-style wit come too few and far between, but the singer finds an affecting comfort zone somewhere between sentimental and nonsensical. And while the optimistic stand-out ""A Fortnight's Time"" veers from
    <em>Pleasures</em>' sad script, the hook is a winning example of Smith's quirky expertise:
    ""Would you like to go on a date with me?/ And I know it's old-fashioned to
    say so/ Five time five equals twenty-five/ Don't you know your times tables by
    now?"" (He may or may not be hitting on a third grader.)
    </p>
<p>
    One of the greatest legacies of the original post-punk-meets-new-wave bands were their stylistic diversity; groups like XTC, Talking Heads, and Devo were
    not only distinct from each other, but they thrived on pushing their respective
    sounds into unpredictable territory. So the fact that the era's apparent
    ancestors are largely repeating themselves or evolving in the same
    traditionally commercial, ""serious"" direction is slightly
    disheartening. Maxïmo Park's first album featured a hazy, spoken-word
    anomaly called ""Acrobat"" that sounded like nothing else on the LP. The song was ballsy and
    beautiful, and it hinted at an untapped adventurousness. There's nothing like
    ""Acrobat"" on <em>Our Earthly Pleasures</em>. With their new album, Maxïmo Park avoid both utter disaster and absolute success by
    playing it safe. Nice and safe.

    Their name means ""Empty Places"" in their native Tamashek language,
    the tongue of a people known to most of the outside world as the Tuareg. The
    Tuareg, who refer to themselves as the Kel Tamashek (""those who speak
    Tamashek"") are traditionally nomadic, occupying a vast swath of the
    Western Sahara that today is split between five different countries. Tinariwen
    formed in a refugee camp in Libya in the early 1980s; most of the members were
    living in exile from their homes in Mali, banished in the wake of a civil war
    and a wave of government repression.</p><p>
    You could say the group, whose membership is indefinite, but generally
    contains about six guitarists and a few female singer/percussionists, plays a
    kind of desert blues, not entirely removed from the transcendent work of Ali
    Farka Touré. But it's not blues in the typical Westerner sense. For starters,
    one chord is almost always enough in this music, but more than that, the blues
    is present as a sense of intense longing and defiance in the face of despair
    that hums in sympathetic vibration with its trans-Atlantic cousin.</p><p>
<em>Aman Iman</em> is Tinariwen's third internationally released album, and
    it's the most powerful statement they've issued so far. It begins with guitars
    that conjure so much: the vast emptiness of the Sahel, the endlessness of a
    desert sky, the gradual shift of sands and the sudden violence of a sandstorm.
    ""Cler Achel"" (""I Spent the Day"") is a song for the
    displaced, ending with the couplet (sung in Tamashek), ""It's a time that
    separates the beloved from those they love/ And when you think of them, painful
    obsessive thoughts are all that come."" Principle vocalist Ibrahim Ag
    Alhabib is echoed by a chanting choir as the guitars swirl around him in
    hypnotic waves, oddly spectral and earthly at the same time. 
    </p>
<p>
    Tinariwen more fully embraces rock texture and volume on this album, opening
    ""Assouf"" (roughly, ""Longing"") with a ferocious electric
    guitar solo edged with wah-wah pedal and distortion. ""Matadjem
    Yinmixan"" (""Why All This Hate Between You?"") just rocks,
    clomping along on a buoyant beat that sends the guitars fluttering off on flights
    that John Coltrane might have admired during his post-modal phase. There's
    tension and release in these songs, but the crescendo and diminuendo of the
    music never feels calculated, flowing with an open-ended spontaneity that
    producer Justin Adams captures brilliantly simply by refusing to manipulate or
    impede it. 
    </p>
<p>
    The music of Tinariwen is at once exotic and familiar-- the scales and
    arrangements are as strange to our ears as the language they sing in, but
    there's a force operating on a more subliminal level that unites it to something
    rattling around inside anyone who was brought up on blues or rock &amp; roll.
    It's music of longing and rebellion, weary wisdom and restless energy, and it
    sounds so, so good. Don't let it pass you by.

    Before we get to what Young Galaxy are, we should talk about what they aren't. While the Canadian duo records for the Arts &amp; Crafts label, they aren't really comparable to Broken Social Scene, the flagship band that all other A&amp;C bands are weighed against. At first blush, Young Galaxy resembles BSS in some superficial ways: namely, their limpid production and cosmic melodies. But BSS's definitive qualities-- ramshackle energy and genre-bending curveballs-- do not factor into Young Galaxy's orderly dream-pop.</p><p>
    Neither is the duo, comprised of Stephen Ramsay and Catherine McCandless, the Stars side project they've often been touted to be. Ramsay was Stars' touring guitarist (a position he's vacated to focus on Young Galaxy), not a permanent fixture or songwriter in the band. If you come to Young Galaxy expecting a Stars record, you will be disappointed-- they work in muted pastels, not blinding neon; they're deliberate where Stars are immediate. Their most obvious influences are the deep-space arrangements of Slowdive and the watery melodies of Luna, although their penchant for poppy hooks renders them more similar to Long Island's Joy Zipper than either of these.</p><p>
    If all this parsing of influences seems a little tedious, this is apt-- Young Galaxy's polite style is itself a little tedious. Their record is as hard to get worked up about as it is easy to like. This mild tedium is most apparent on the more rock-oriented tracks, which don't play to Young Galaxy's talent for atmosphere-building and make the vocals sound generic. So despite its supernova guitars and some memorable lyrics (""You won't get out of this world alive,"" Ramsay sings with benevolent certainty), ""No Matter How Hard You Try"" doesn't make a big impression. The rockers aren't bad, but they make Young Galaxy sound interchangeable with about a million other totally fine but unexceptional indie rock bands.
    </p>
<p>
    Ramsay and McCandless fare much better when they hew closer to classic shoegaze, with tidally lapping organs and blissful harmonies. On their best songs, they slowly build towering armatures around uplifting vocal refrains. ""Swing Your Heartache"" is excellent: Coasting in on a watery hum, it gains amplitude at a leisurely pace, soaring in a way that feels hard-earned by the end. ""The Sun's Coming Up and My Plane's Going Down"" has the same sense of expansive drift; it's spacious and billowing, orbiting its central melody rather than slamming it home with guitars. Appropriately, orbiting seems to be key for Young Galaxy-- they sound fine when they're direct, but they sound great when they're oblique, letting their melodic themes gradually unfurl via a procession of oceanic keys, saccharine harmonies, and the judicious flash of heat-lightning guitar.

    You'd have to be pretty heartless to hate a purdy
    little folk album like <em>Human Like a House</em>. For one thing, the San
    Franciscan duo the Finches stick to a bare-boned style that's loyal to the genre's
    oldest roots-- we're talking troubadour music here. They even break into
    ""Auld Lang Syne"" midway through one track. On their entire innocuous
    debut, there's not a single musical curveball-- not even one syncopated note--
    that'd catch a listener off guard, mainly because jolting the listener would
    rudely distract him or her from one of singer Carolyn Pennypacker Riggs's
    heartwarming lyrical tales. However, like mom and pop stores or VHS cassettes,
    the Finches have trouble competing with 21st century innovations and trends,
    and <em>Human</em>'s backward thinking, front-porch-rocking-chair charisma pales
    in comparison to more progressive folk contemporaries.</p><p>
    Riggs and childhood chum/guitarist Aaron Morgan rely
    exclusively on a two-guitar formula that seldom strays from a beginner's chord
    book, making them pretty anachronistic at a time when most ""folk""
    exposure comes via Animal Collective or Joanna Newsom. Even the most wholesome,
    grassroots indie acts would only record one or two songs like these per album,
    mainly as novelty. As admirable as the Finches' dedication to simplicity may
    be, the three-chord limitation bleeds most of the songs together, or, even
    worse, renders them indistinguishable from lullabies or nursery rhymes. <em>Human</em>
    does have its bright spots, and, no surprise, they occur on the most nuanced
    tracks. ""Last Favor"" tumbles over one of the album's few basslines,
    and Morgan's backup vocals help amplify some of Riggs's sharpest hooks.
    Likewise, Riggs's haunting coos on ""The House Under the Hill"" manage
    to capture the otherwise painfully absent sense of mysticism and wonder that
    should be a gimme for folk.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, these highlights fail to offset the
    album's supposed centerpieces. ""Nightswimming, AR"" has all the
    trappings of a show-stopping ballad, replete with nostalgic kiss-and-tell
    lyrics and Riggs' intimate half-sung, half-whispered melody. However, the track
    fails musically to make the sultry story compelling as the guitars move through
    one predictable chord after another. Likewise, the sentimental ""Leviathans
    Home!"" closes an album that already has eleven other wistful closers
    willing to bid the listener a tender adieu. This emotional flatline best
    underscores <em>House</em>'s laundry list of shortcomings as an album not
    entirely guilty of simplicity or folk fundamentalism, but rather the Finches'
    ennui in delivering it. Sadly, the title falsely advertises, suggesting
    a record that captures the human condition. Instead, we get an album as
    mechanical and soulless as a computer-generated simulation.

    Niblock and, especially, LaMonte Young is what happens when a fixation on held
    tones reaches a tipping point. Timbre is reduced to either a single clear
    instrument or a sine wave, silence disappears completely, and the base-level
    interaction between small clusters of ""pure"" tone becomes the music's
    content. This kind of work takes what typically helps us to distinguish ""music""
    from ""sound,"" discards nearly all of it, and then starts over again
    from scratch.</p><p>
    Drone legends Stars of the Lid find their music
    drifting toward this rarefied place on their first album after an almost
    six-year absence. On first listen, <em>And Their Refinement of the Decline </em>seems
    a continuation of its beloved precursor, 2001's <em>The Tired Sounds of...</em> It
    is again a double CD with about two hours of music; it uses a similar palette
    of violin, cello, and Stuart Dempster-inspired horns to augment the
    electronically generated drones. Song titles again refer to brain chemistry
    (""Dopamine Clouds Over Craven Cottage""), altered states
    (""Another Ballad for Heavy Lids""), and the nuts and bolts of the
    music's creation (Apreludes (in C sharp major)""). And yet, upon putting on
    <em>Tired Sounds of...</em> again for comparison, I see Adam Wiltzie and Brian
    McBride have actually come some distance in the last half-decade. And the place
    they're moving to is starker, quieter, somehow even more subtle, where the
    tiniest amount of sound information is put upon to do the greatest amount of
    work. Where <em>Tired Sounds of...</em> sounded genteel and stately next to the raw
    four-track feedback fests they'd started with (""Tape Hiss Makes Me
    Happy"" summed up their debut nicely), it now sounds about halfway between
    their genesis and this album; ""refinement"" turns out to be the
    perfect word.</p><p>
    The first thing that becomes apparent is that there's
    less discernible guitar here. The acoustic instruments once served as foils to
    the channeled electricity, but now they've taken center stage, and the horns
    and strings are often used in a curious way. Rather than being stretched out to
    push against silence with drone music proper, on tracks like ""Dungtitled
    (in A Major)"" and ""The Evil that Never Arrived"", flugelhorn,
    cello, and violin are used in short, slowly decaying bursts, keeping skeletal
    tunes aloft by bumping them with a chord every few seconds. The added space
    between the notes makes the pieces seem less forward and pervasive, like they might vanish into the air at any moment. It also cuts the drama and leaves the
    music more open to interpretation.
    </p><p>
    While SOTL will always be tagged as
    ""cinematic,"" the music here rarely leads. You get the sense that this
    it could be used to color a wide array of images. The brief ""Hiberner
    Toujours"" on the second disc is a three-note phrase played on a cello with
    an intense vibrato and heavy reverb, first alone, then doubled, with muted
    electronic treatments lurking just behind. I could just as easily see it
    soundtracking a morning-after newsreel of a WWII firebombing or a stop-motion
    blooming of a flower. And then ""Humectez La Mouture"" extends an idea
    developed by the sorely missed Labradford and perfected by the Books: A
    deceptively simple and spacious bit of music with a neutral emotional cast is presented
    without additional cues and allowed to live or die on its own. Here SOTL take a
    couple of piano chords lightly kissed with electronics and let the progression
    play with small bits of shading, including what sounds like manipulated pedal
    steel and the dialog track from a French film. It doesn't ""go""
    anywhere, really, and it's hard to say what it projects; the music could be
    crushingly sad, lightly melancholic, or even uplifting, depending on the state
    of mind of the hearer. It becomes a sound divorced from intention and its
    ambiguity is its strength.
    </p>
<p>
    This stripping down and moving away from easily
    definable mood makes <em>And Their Refinement of the Decline </em>a bit harder to
    grasp initially than any previous SOTL record. The less pronounced changes and
    more sparing use of dynamic range means that the music can easily slip into the
    background when something else requires attention. That's par for the course
    with ambient music, of course, but I get the sense this music is shortchanged
    by being functional. There's too much focus on the careful layering of sounds,
    and too many small but still important tweaks happening from moment to moment
    to let everything slide by in an undifferentiated blob of sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's the rare moment when SOTL tip their hand and let
    more expressionistic feelings seep into the music that you understand how well
    the album works as a whole. The brilliant ""Even if You're Never Awake
    (Deuxième)"" is one such place, as its surges of strings are gradually cut
    with curled shavings of backward guitar, and some almost sub-sonic bass halfway
    through its 9 minutes announces an even wearier turn into the lament's final
    section. It ""develops"" in the conventional sense, as does ""December Hunting for Vegetarian Fuckface"", the album's
    final track. 
    </p>
<p>
    After almost two hours we arrive at perhaps the most
    playful title ever from a band known for playful titles, and also what could be
    SOTL's defining statement. ""December Hunting"" is like the band's
    entire history playing out in a single piece, all the tensions in their music--
    acoustic vs. electric, cryptic vs. obvious, joyous vs. sorrowful-- are
    articulated and probed in 17 heavenly minutes of drone without a tedious
    moment. It's the final and greatest example of that special thing that happens,
    with all due respect to their fine solo material, only when these two get
    together.

    Nick Cave
    turns 50 this year, and with his receding hairline and even gaunter appearance
    of late, he could easily settle into his rock twilight years, wherein the
    edginess of his career-making early work is smoothed over for a mature AOR radio-friendly
    sound. In fact, his decision to employ a gospel choir on his 2004 double album,
    <em>Abbatoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus</em>,
    might have been a step toward adult contemporary schmaltz,
    were it not for the album's psychotic meditations on artistic inspiration and
    good-versus-evil. The one-time shitkicking Birthday Party singer and
    rabble-rousing Bad Seeds frontman may have refined his attack, but even as his
    musical range has expanded, his subject matter remains visceral
    without being gratuitous and intelligent without being academic. Balancing
    vulgarity with suavity (the man looks good in a suit), he's turning
    expectations of middle age inside out, making a mockery of all the
    gone-soft musicians who have fortressed themselves against obsolescence with
    standards albums and reunion tours.</p><p>
    So, every time you play Cave's new double-live 2xCD/2xDVD
    set, a little part of Sting dies. That alone should be enough to keep it in
    constant rotation, but <em>The Abbatoir Blues
    Tour</em> is actually a solid entry in Cave's canon, one of too few live
    releases from the brooding bard, perhaps even besting the so-so<em> Live Seeds</em> from 1993, which has several
    tracks in common. <em>Abbatoir/Orpheus</em> was
    a particularly strong album, one that made good use of its double-disc sprawl
    and filled every song with intriguing musical and thematic ideas. If at times
    this even bigger set seems a little redundant of its studio predecessor, it's
    fascinating to see how Cave and his coterie have adapted these ideas to the
    stage and how new songs sit alongside earlier material like ""The Weeping Song"",
    ""Deanna"", and ""Stagger Lee"", which noisily disembowels the American blues
    legend. Between this set, the upcoming badassathon of his side project
    Grinderman, and his screenplay for last year's Aussie epic <em>The Proposition</em>, Cave still has fire in his belly.</p><p>
    Shot to suggest the dynamic of a barfight, the two DVDs-- recorded
    at London's Brixton
    Academy and Hammersmith Apollo-- emphasize
    the physicality of the Bad Seeds' performance, specifically the concentration
    with which each member contributes to the larger sound. Halfway through each
    lead track, they're already soaked in sweat-- all except Cave, despite his
    jet-black suit and manic Elvis swagger. I suppose the lights of a London
    stage can't compare with the intensity of the fires of hell. As on the studio
    albums, the backing singers mock, taunt, curse, and defy Cave, his characters,
    and even the audience, adding slick retorts to ""Stagger Lee"" and genuinely
    gorgeous uplift to ""O Children"". On the other hand, the music seems all the
    more potent for having a live audience present during its creation. That
    shouldn't be surprising, considering that Cave has always played the part of a
    preacher and invested his songs with a sort of rapturous conviction. In this
    case, singing along to ""Red Right Hand"", apparently a crowd favorite, would
    seem to be the equivalent of speaking in tongues.
    </p>
<p>
    Like <em>Abbatoir/Orpheus,</em>
    these two DVDs showcase two sides of the band: the Brixton disc features
    harder, harsher <em>Abbatoir</em> songs like ""Get Ready for Love"" and ""There She Goes,
    My Beautiful World"", while the much shorter, somewhat anticlimactic Hammersmith
    set echoes the softer, more balladlike <em>Orpheus</em>,
    with songs like ""Nobody's Baby Now"" and ""Wonderful Life"" (albeit not a single
    song from either <em>Abbatoir</em> or <em>Orpheus</em>). 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, there are no tidy categorizations: the Birthday
    Party-era ""Wild World"" begins quietly, with Cave at his piano, but erupts into a
    show-closing din. Warren Ellis' flute set begins ""Nature Boy"" softly, even
    sweetly, but quickly becomes dissonant racket, and ""Red Right Hand"" veers
    wildly between a lovely guitar/piano duet and abrupt bursts of abrasive noise.
    The backing singers goad the skronk of ""Stagger Lee"", lending it the staginess
    of a showtune, which makes the imagery all the more visceral. The infernal
    dread of ""Red Right Hand"", the vulgar theatrics of ""Stagger Lee"", and the hoary
    pastoral of ""Breathless"" don't merely cohabitate here, but feed off one another
    to create a beautiful grotesquerie and reveal the breadth of the band's
    endeavors.

    Since upper Norway in early February remains dark both at night and during most of the day, it is impossible for a visitor with
    only three days in the country to assess time with any accuracy. Add alcohol,
    plus sleep deprivation to the already extant sensory deprivation, and the task
    becomes laughable. The vague occasion was the after-party to what had
    previously seemed the after-party, on the day after the last night of
    Trondheim's by:Larm festival, and thus it could have been nearly any time in the
    early or even late morning that we emerged out of cluster of warehouses and,
    ducking the wind off the snow and the nearby fjord, ascended the steps up into
    the third or fifth venue of the evening.</p><p>
    Though we had been told otherwise, we did not expect
    the ""biker bar"" to which we had been referred to contain
    American-style bikers, to boast mounted Death Valley cow skulls and
    wall-to-wall worn-out leather jackets. And we did not expect the Moving Oos,
    which we knew as a side-project to the New Violators and were our last stop
    before the airport, to have much to do with ""classic rock""--
    somewhere, somebody sketchily said, between the Faces and MC5. We expected them
    to sound like the New Violators: gauzy not bluesy, early 1980s not early 70s,
    good clothes and a dignified affect, not blue jeans and jean jackets.</p><p>
    OK, that's not quite right. We knew their singer had
    worked as a truck driver and knew that Per Borten, the gifted music mimic,
    singer, and songwriter behind New Violators, wrote the Moving Oos' songs too. And
    we knew that the New Violators' occasional backup singer/siren was one of the
    two ""oos"" in that band's three-person vocal front (the two bands also
    share a drummer and keyboardist). Two of us had even seen the Oos the night
    before. But who could believe the same people carrying off such a brilliant
    American/English 80s pop resurrection could be doing the same thing later that
    evening  for a completely different decade, the 1970s??
    </p>
<p>
    Anybody who's heard Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones or
    the Black Crowes or AC/DC-- everybody-- will know what's coming in this music
    minutes before it actually happens, making <em>Peace and Love</em> a brain-teaser
    of a good record. How can we still enjoy this stuff: the bluesy lick, guitar or
    keys; the tambourine hits on the eights; the gesture skyward cued by women
    saying ""ooh""; the multi-tracked, song-title-based chorus? The
    motorcycle revs on ""Natural Man"", the ""Shine On You Crazy
    Diamond"" interpolation on ""Turn Back Time"", the ""Rock and
    Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" intro on not one but two songs,
    ""Prisoner"" and ""Promised Land""?
    </p>
<p>
    One answer is that <em>Peace and Love</em> is less homage
    than pretty close to the real thing, right place/wrong time, maybe, but right
    songs. What makes <em>Peace and Love</em> more than a joke or side-project or
    late night drunken escapism is something perhaps old fashioned or unfashionable, but it has
    to do with everyone in the band knowing how to sing, how to play their
    instruments, everyone knowing the exact moment on ""Romancer"" to get
    out of the way and let the two women deliver the second chorus by themselves, a
    shivery and sharp moment of clarity that says, just maybe, these guys know what
    they're about.
    </p>
    It's
    easy to be taken by bands you see this way-- foreign place, foreign time,
    perfect for the exact moment they're stepping out into-- but the Moving Oos
    have no trouble pulling that space up by themselves, without help. Skeptics
    beware.</div>"|10037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10037-peace-and-love/|7.9|Zach Baron

It's almost as if the mere act of thinking through one's music enough to create a cohesive album-length concept, be it as simple as a thematic focus or as complex as a narrative structure, is a crime of pretension severe enough to cut one's punk membership card in half. This line of thinking ignores the fact that punk was essentially built upon fictional premises, the idea of band-as-outlaw perpetuated by the Clash or the Ramones, not to mention the more obvious conceptual themes groups like the Misfits or the Descendents used to drive their respective aesthetics.</p><p>
    Fortunately, a few modern bands are similarly dismissive of this inaccuracy, from the straightforward, sci-fi editorializing approach of the Thermals to the farther-out-there concepts that Liars use to organize their experiments. <em>Soft Skeletons</em> indicates that Call Me Lightning are another band unafraid of thematic consistency, as it features several songs dealing with, well, skeletons. But bony ghouls are just the album's most persistent symbol; in a larger sense, <em>Soft Skeletons</em> is an album about death and dying, a morose focus at odds with the band's raucous garage-punk. It's not an entirely discordant clash of sound and message; with their cartoonish seizure guitars and video-game basslines, the band sounds like they're playing endless punk-rock variations on the <em>Tales From the Crypt</em> theme or the Danny Elfman score for a Tim Burton movie. Appropriate then to be talking about shattered tombs (""Billion Eyes"") or describing post-death biological processes from the point of view of the corpse (""Beaming Streaks""), as if Call Me Lightning were crafting a rock'n'roll tribute to EC Comics.</p><p>
    However, for such an approach, a certain level of acting chops are required from the singer, as it's easier to swallow songs about zombies and hauntings when delivered with the B-movie affectations of a Glenn Danzig or Nick Cave. Call Me Lightning's Nathan Lilley chooses instead to go the vocal-cord ripping route, yelling and screeching over the din of his band and sacrificing any kind of creepy subtlety in the process. His limitations show on tracks both fast (the Advantage-like ""Nobody Dies"") and slow (the brooding ""Filthy Information""), while the vocal melodies (and the shoutalong backings) frequently lose out to the playful and tuneful runs of the guitar/bass interplay.  Call Me Lightning aspire to be a Milwaukee spin on the snide throwback Pixies-punk of Mclusky, but whether due to lack of Welsh accent or a less sharp sense of humor, <em>Soft Skeletons</em> never quite gets there. Sure, songs like ""Bottles and Bottles"" or ""Shadow Twin"", at least instrumentally, generate a novel spin on the familiar moves of spastic post-punk Frenchkiss acts. But too many stumbles and failures of execution keep the record from being much more than a noble attempt at reconciling punk with its conceptual roots, leaving an attempt at horror-punk that doesn't succeed at being even marginally scary or particularly memorable.</p></div>"|10063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10063-soft-skeletons/|5.2|Rob Mitchum

He's neither as clever as Bun B nor as witty as Biggie, and he doesn't begin to approach the charisma of a T.I. or the talent of Lil' Wayne. Buck's shtick, quite simply, is that he's sounds like a very real dude. Sure, authenticity is a slippery notion, but it is integral to the appeal of <em>Buck the World</em> and is at least, in part, explainable. Much of it has to with Buck's voice-- a gruff, damaged baritone that is both punishing and straining-- but it's also because his rhymes are three dimensional. Listen to the first verse on ""Look at Me Now"", from his debut, where Buck lights ""cancer sticks"" beneath streetlights, wondering how to get his mother out of ""bricks"" that have neither lights nor water.  That desire is undercut by reality, and soon Buck quips that ""Er'body got a grave, we just waitin' to go to it."" Or listen to ""Slow Your Roll"", from the occasionally satisfying yet largely disappointing sophomore album, <em>Buck the World</em>, where he tenderly recounts friends, lovers and neighbors who died too early.</p><p>
    Of course, it also doesn't hurt his cred that Buck (aka David Darnell Brown) stabbed a man in front of cameras at the 2004 Vibe Awards, and later, amazingly, walked out of court with only a three-year probationary period. That darker, violent side is also apparent on <em>Buck the World</em>, and tracks such as the title track, ""Push 'Em Back"" and ""Buss Yo' Head"" are pure bluster. His haters, in particular, have it hard. They're ""broke bitches"" who ""won't say it to my face"" and meet a variety of ends, all unpleasant. Buck will creep out from under their beds and bust their ""motherfucking head."" He'll kidnap their children (who conveniently attend the same school as Buck's kids) and he brings an AK to the club. You know the drill.</p><p>
    These raps pander to Buck's devotees, but they alienate Buck from pop audiences and undermine his credibility. Though these tracks largely avoid the wealth porn evident on his guest spot on Lil' Scrappy's single ""Money in the Bank"", they are are still fantastical and hyper-stylized, and they grow old quickly, especially when the beats are as dull as they are here. Sure, ""4 Kings""-- featuring T.I., Young Jeezy, and Pimp C-- and ""Get Buck"" are hot, but these sort of tracks worked better on Buck's debut. The hooks were bigger and more memorable, and regardless of how you feel about them personally, G-Unit members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks and expat the Game are great studio gangstas.
    </p><p>
    Which brings us to one of the biggest differences between <em>World</em> and his previous album, <em>Straight Outta Cashville</em>. Despite his purported allegiance on the meddling ""Clean Up Man"", Buck (or his handlers) are hedging their bets as far as G-Unit is concerned. On <em>Cashville</em>, released at the height of Fiddy's notoriety, members of G-unit popped up on six of the albums 15 tracks. Buck the World only features one G-Unit collaboration, 50 Cent's ""Hold On"". Dre is still around, but he's still in the same lame musak phase as he was on Jay-Z's <em>Kingdom Come</em>. On ""U Ain't Going Nowhere"", he reaches for jazzy nuance, but instead creates something sounds like the music for a cruise commercial. Elsewhere, the red hot Polow Da Don (who produced Rich Boy's smash ""Throw Some D's"") delivers another banger with the trombone laced ""Get Buck"", while ""Haters"", produced by upcoming Seattle beatsmith Vitamin D, is ravaging skeletal soul.
    </p>
<p>
    The problem with <em>Buck the World</em> is that it's largely inconsistent. There are 15 producers over 17 tracks. Sometimes it clicks, but other times it feels forced. Considering Buck's promises, I 'd hoped for an album along the lines of Scarface's classic <em>My Diary</em>. But in the end, <em>World</em> is too generic and uneven.

    When it comes down to the big three producer-MCs who have defined club-friendly rap over the past decade-- Diddy, Pharrell and Timbaland-- Tim's the one who's been best able to rein in his self-indulgent tendencies. He hasn't spent more time being a pop icon than a musician, hasn't suffered from any major dry spells of creative entropy and, most importantly, has known enough to let his beats do most of the heavy lifting. This might be one of the reasons he's considered by most trainspotter pop fiends to be more of a genius than those other two; even when Tim runs his mouth, it's typically been innocuously catchy-- even complementary-- enough to keep the production's strengths at the forefront. The other main factor in his genius, as anyone who's had a radio on at any point in the last decade knows, is his ability to integrate unexpected niche-genre sonics most hip hop and R&amp;B producers wouldn't steer towards-- bhangra, jungle, trance-- and use them for a kind of universal club futurism that, since it fits well in damn near every place people dance, makes for an easy route to chart and cultural dominance.</p><p>
    When Tim's shit goes wrong, though, it's harder to get to the root of the problem. His recent bodybuilding obsession, his divisive, grandstanding mini-sets during the Justin Timberlake tour, and his forehead-smack of a beef with Scott Storch (?)(!) have made for great blog-snark gossip fodder, but they don't necessarily signal any kind of creative decline, especially after the juggernaut year he had in '06. But while solo Timbaland's always been a mixed bag, <em>Timbaland Presents Shock Value</em> is more mediocre than it has any right to be, filled with overreaching pretense and phoned-in vacancy-- either trying too hard, or not hard enough.</p><p>
    Almost everything potentially great and really wrong about <em>Shock Value</em> is exhibited in leadoff track ""Oh Timbaland"". The beat's built on the same piano hook (from Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman"") that Kanye West pillaged for Talib Kweli's ""Get By""-- he's just made it more manic, releasing some Dirty South tension with Shaq-hand-sized claps and Catfish Collins chicken-scratch guitar. It's a hell of a way to start things off, even assuming you don't care that a song about a man futilely trying to escape his transgressions is being appropriated so Tim can issue death threats and brag about his private planes. Simone's reconstructed voice is a sinister hook (""Oh Timbaland, where you gonna run to?""), and Tim's answer to this haunting, retribution-of-God threat (a quickly tossed-off ""nowhere""), is a sign of the hubris to follow.</p><p>
    Not that Tim half-asses anything on the production end. The first two-thirds of the album are front-loaded with the kind of futuristic club beats his rep rests on, and some of them-- the berserk Bootsy-meets-Thomas Dolby-by-way-of-Basement Jaxx house-funk of ""Release"" and the ""The Way I Are"", which sounds like ""Push It"" gone trance-- are straight-up jaw-droppers. But the record's also plagued with some of the most empty, dead-eyed, joyless lyrics to hit the clubs in a while. Tim's on-record persona has soured drastically in the last few years, trading in the relaxed party-rocker's swagger of <em>Tim's Bio</em> and <em>Indecent Proposal</em> for a tensed-up, violent defensiveness. Where he used to be all about shaking off haters and basking contentedly in his wealth, he seems a lot more obsessed now with maintaining a shaky thug cred and using his status as a bludgeon.</p><p>
    ""I know shit ain't sweet, so the shit get deep/ I'm rich, I can pay to have you six feet deep,"" he mutters lifelessly on ""Come and Get Me"", while the petulant hostility of ""Kill Yourself"" culminates in a chorus (""Go on, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself/ If I was you I wouldn't feel myself"") that feels like the Dew-fueled frothing of a 14-year-old caught up in an anime message board flamewar. Even his turn on the hilarious failure of a strip-club jam ""Bounce"" (as in ""...like your ass has the hiccups"") is riddled with death threats and gun talk; at least guest rapper Dr. Dre-- who, admittedly, resorts to terrible Chinese-name double-entendres (""Sum Yung Ho"") and rhyming ""ain't this money handsome"" with ""ain't this a panty anthem""-- remembers it's a track about fucking.</p><p>
    In this context, rife with fuck-you-haters self-consciousness and obnoxious posturing, even the guest roster on this album feels like it's caught up in a lazy arrogance. Justin Timberlake shows up on three tracks, first offering more of the usual Prince-baiting on lead single ""Give It to Me"", and then some ecstatic harmonies on ""Release"", which are great when you can hear them
    under Tim's atonal half-sung bellowing. (This same atonal half-sung
    bellowing overextends its welcome on almost every non-rap track, by the
    way.) Unfortunately, his dopey ""you on me and me on you and you on <em>her</em>"" traffic control on ""Bounce"" marks one of the album's most slack-jaw stupid moments. Aside from a freaky-as-hell Missy, pretty much every guest rapper-- from 50 and Tony Yayo to Attitude and D.O.E.-- rhyme like they didn't have to pay half a mil to get their spot on the track. (Jay-Z and Kanye were supposed to be on the album, but missed the deadline-- aw, don't be sad, there's a Magoo appearance!)</p><p>
    Then there's the much-touted rock collaborations, which either fail to play to the bands' strengths (the Hives' Howlin' Pelle Almqvist-- backup singer?) or prove why Timbaland is still a hell of a lot more interesting than most modern rock in the first place. The only thing more cringeworthy than the first time Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump screams a simpering ""wipe that smi-hul off your fucking fayyyyce"" in ""One &amp; Only"" is the eighth time-- though the line ""Be my unholy, my one and my lonely"" is a pretty strong contender. And the last track, ""2 Man Show"", features Tim admonishing Elton John for coming in too early with the piano, then spends the rest of the track talking about how great the song actually is rather than just proving it. Like almost every other lyric on the album, it's all a conceited bluff.
    </p>
<p>
    So Timbaland spends an hour on the wrong side of the ""ft."", fans wind up cringing for a while, and then we suddenly remember he's doing the Björk album and we get geeked again. As bad as this album is, it's not offensive enough to worry about for too long; if its contents were split up into 17 singles and B-sides and one-shots and scattered across the charts for 15 months, it'd hardly be worth worrying about. It's just that it's  disconcerting sometimes to be confronted with an entire album's worth of evidence that geniuses can fuck up, just like everyone else.

    bands who can keep selling records after the music industry's struggles with technology are all over, I hope Cloud Cult will be one. The
    Minnesota-based art-rockers make their recordings using geothermal energy and
    recycled materials, donate proceeds to environmentally friendly
    charities, and play concerts with an onstage painter. Their grand, unkempt
    indie rock is at once jam band, emo, and avant-garde. Their songs, born out of
    personal tragedy, are otherworldly lessons in being human.</p><p>
    On Cloud Cult's sixth album in seven years, <em>The Meaning of 8</em>,
    founding singer-songwriter Craig Minowa remains both tormented and inspired by
    the 2002 death of his infant son, Kaidin. Excess has always been part of
    Minowa's unique brilliance, and this album is still overstuffed with enough concepts,
    instrumentation, and emotional climaxes for cathartic collectives like the
    Arcade Fire or Danielson. At the same time, <em>The Meaning of 8</em> underscores
    that what made previous Cloud Cult releases so powerfully affecting was not
    just Minowa's grief, but also his eccentricities.</p><p>
    Where 2004's <em>Aurora Borealis</em> sought to reach Minowa's son through
    light, and 2005's <em>Advice for the Happy Hippopotamus</em> by transcending
    flesh, <em>The Meaning of 8</em> resorts to chemicals. Songwriting can be
    like medicine, Minowa has said, a way to deal with pain. Fittingly, free
    download ""Take Your Medicine"" showcases the band's strengths,
    dissolving jagged bass, violin, faraway piano, music-box lullabies, and choral
    chants into a bittersweet, eclectic whole. The source of Minowa's pain (and one
    ""meaning"" of the album's title) becomes apparent amid storming
    electric guitars on ""Your 8th Birthday"", as he repeatedly cries his
    departed son's name.
    </p>
<p>
    In usual form, Cloud Cult vent their sadness through songs that combine
    emotional release with heterogeneous arrangements, and often, head-nodding
    beats. The most successful tracks-- such as the soaring elegy ""Dance for the
    Dead"", with its stomping percussion and room-filling harmonies-- exhibit some
    of the unpretentious abandon that made earlier records so exhilarating. ""A
    Good God"" envisions Jesus as He-Man before skidding into an extended,
    distorted breakdown, while ""Alien Christ"" is a more cynical look at
    the supernatural. Upbeat rocker ""Please Remain Calm"" even shares one of
    <em>Hippopotamus</em>'s themes, imagining a boy ""with the helmet of an
    astronaut.""
    </p>
<p>
    Sometimes, though, the songs here are glossier and more tepid than Cloud
    Cult's finest work. The band supposedly turned down major-label offers to go it
    alone for <em>The Meaning of 8</em>, and first YouTube video selection
    ""Chemicals Collide"" does have clean acoustic fingerpicking,
    tame power chords, and weepy strings that would signify affect on a
    Braffish TV drama. Then there's the uncharacteristic triteness of ""Pretty
    Voice"", an acoustic strummer about... missing a pretty voice. Scrubbed, as
    well, are Minowa's least broadly palatable eccentricities: <em>Princess Bride</em>
    sample pastiches, live audience-participation numbers, famous Neil Young
    quotes, cut-and-paste screeds equating President Bush with Hitler, or rhymes
    involving ""hippopotamus."" You know, the <em>fun</em> stuff.
    </p>
<p>
    I've long maintained Cloud Cult have a lot in common with the Arcade Fire.
    Sure, <em>The Meaning of 8</em> finds Minowa &amp; Co. again adapting the
    Montreal band's ardent crests and church-sized arrangements with futuristic
    fairy tales, hippie freakouts, and electronics. Still, <em>Funeral </em>didn't
    just blow our minds; as ""Intervention"" reminds us, it also codified
    standards for Serious, Important rock-- ones that don't necessarily capture
    what makes <em>Funeral</em> serious and important. Frivolity, in this context, is
    frowned upon.
    </p>
<p>
    Without Minowa's childlike weirdness, <em>The Meaning of 8 </em>has little to
    lighten its deathly gravity except ""The Deaf Girl's Song"", a sugary
    solo acoustic ballad about a deaf girl who writes a silent song. The last track
    on <em>The Meaning of 8</em> is a minute-plus; no sound. How Earth-friendly is
    that?

Back in the 1960s, head Crayola Mayo Thompson had been a psychedelic garage-rock guy with a lot of weird ideas; in the 70s, he fell in with the London concept-art crew Art &amp; Language, then found himself in the post-punk scene, producing records and talent-scouting for Rough Trade. And somewhere in there, he and Pere Ubu developed a mutual infatuation.</p><p>
    The Red Crayola, by 1979, were basically a two-man operation, with Thompson's tremulous warble and spasms of thin, ear-piercing guitar held together by Jesse Chamberlain's clattering drums; some of <em>Soldier-Talk</em> is just the duo building up friction-heat. Still, all of the then-current lineup of Pere Ubu shows up on most of the album, too (along with Lora Logic, whose inimitable out-of-tune sax can be heard here and there). It's difficult to tell if David Thomas, squeaking out a parody of military chants in the background of ""Soldier-Talk"" and sarcastically parroting Thompson on ""Discipline"", is chafing at being somebody else's sideman or getting into it. Later that year, guitarist Tom Herman left Ubu and Thompson replaced him, which effectively makes <em>Soldier-Talk</em> the misshapen missing link between Ubu's <em>New Picnic Time</em> and <em>The Art of Walking</em>.</p><p>
    But this isn't a Pere Ubu record, it's a Red Crayola record, and in 1979, that meant as much pain as they could get away with inflicting. Thompson's a charismatic vocalist, but he's possibly the least naturally gifted <em>singer</em> to have attempted to perform vocal melodies for anywhere near this long (I mean, Mark E. Smith can at least sing sort of on pitch sometimes), or at any rate the most invested in displaying his voice's cracks and fumbles. His guitar is set for maximal nails-on-chalkboard trebliness-- ""On the Brink"" has a great little one-finger riff, but it's hard to listen to it without wincing-- and, in accordance with the album's martial theme, Chamberlain limits most of his drum parts to modified military tattoos and snare-snaps.</p><p>
    Then there's the matter of Thompson's lyrics, which are doggedly mock-academic: ""The problem of discourse is problematic/ I insist in this respect on being most emphatic."" It's a consistently <em>interesting</em> album-- there's something trying to get your attention at every moment, but in the manner of a beloved little sibling who won't stop poking you. (When a band calls a song ""Uh, Knowledge Dance"", it's clear that ""dance"" will be the least important of those three words.) Thompson was pretty obviously fascinated with the possibilities of abrasion and intellectual content in rock songs that punk and post-punk opened up, and the next time he convened the Red Crayola, for 1981's excellent <em>Kangaroo?</em> album and ""Born in Flames"" single, he'd figured out how pleasure in listening could be a part of the equation too. This one, though, is for people who find Gang of Four's <em>Entertainment!</em> excessively silky and bourgeois.</p></div>"|9938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9938-soldier-talk/|5.3|Douglas Wolk

From this sound, the song could     emerge as anything and the band could sound like anyone. The next thing you     hear, however, is Juanita Stein's voice, which is thoroughly unexpected,     confidently strange, and immediately commanding. She delivers a lilting tune     for the first verse, breaking her syllables into melodic filigrees that sound     simultaneously angelic and demonic. Then ""The Bell Hit"" takes another     turn when the band reaches the chorus and the song becomes a country     sing-along. The Howling Bells have some surprises, for sure.</p>
<p>All of the sounds on ""The Bell Hit"" and the     dozen songs that follow become familiar: the dark rumble of ""Low     Happening"" and ""Broken Bones"" recalls Lush and Mazzy Star, the     sweeping melody of ""In the Woods"" is full-on <i>Fuzzy</i>-era Grant     Lee Buffalo, and Stein's vocals bring to mind anyone from the Sundays' Harriet     Wheeler to Cocteau Twins' Liz Frazer to Patsy Cline. And yet, the Howling Bells     touch on these fairly obvious influences without sounding dated, revivalist, or     imitative. In fact, until a last-minute lull, the album sounds vital and even     occasionally thrilling, powered by the band's muscular sound and the lively     production by Ken Nelson, whose work with Coldplay and Gomez never hinted at     his facility for a dirtier, more ominous atmosphere.</p>
<p>Because they have a clear affection for old country     music and rural instrumentation, the Howling Bells have been referred to as     country-goth, but they're actually no more goth than any hard-living, hard-drinking     country act from the last 50 years (and certainly nowhere near as goth as     fellow Aussie Nick Cave). Slower songs like ""The Bell Hit"" and     ""I'm Not Afraid"" kick around country-road guitar licks and shuffle     along on Glenn Moule's brushed snare. Stein sings so convincingly about     world-weary pub pathos-- that inexhaustible country subject-- on ""Broken     Bones"" and ""The Night Is Young"" that she must have first-hand     experience. ""You drink from the heart and you pour from the soul,""     she sings on ""Low Happening"" as the guitars snarl. ""You listen     to trash but it's my rock 'n' roll!"" Gloom and doom reign on this album,     and not just because death looms around the corner-- which it certainly does--     but because Stein doesn't see enough life going on around her to make death     meaningful.</p>
<p>Currently, the Bells' debut is available in America     only as a pricey import, although it's been widely heralded in England and     Australia. As of this writing, the band has not signed an American distribution     deal, but one is surely forthcoming, right? When they do reach these shores, who     knows how they'll be greeted? Perhaps their impact will be as limited as that     of the bands mentioned above: a few songs popular enough to be loudly requested     at live shows by loyal fans, probably a song on a television montage, maybe     even a best-of comp and a mention as an influence for some future band. These songs make clear that the Howling Bells know there are worse things.     As Stein sings on ""The Bell Hit"", ""This life is a fate unknown,     I never dreamt of it.""</p></div>"|10043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10043-the-howling-bells/|7.8|Stephen M. Deusner

    The Anticon label is usually home to unorthodox hip-hop and electronic
    music, but they've made an exception for Why? cohort SJ Esau's first
    label-distributed solo album. Though Sam Wisternoff began his music career
    rapping in his hometown of Bristol, England (at age eight, no less), under the
    SJ Esau tag he focuses on atmospheric indie rock that borrows from the Scottish post-rock scene and Hood.</p><p>
    A few moments stand out-- usually
    by impressing with a unique or unexpected texture-- but for the most part, it seems
    Wisternoff could stand to tighten the c-clamp on his head, as pictured on the album's cover.
    Focused melodies simply don't live here, which makes it hard to keep coming
    back to even the better arrangements.
    Wisternoff's reedy voice isn't bad, but he gives himself little to work with on
    songs like ""Wears the Control"" and ""The Wrong Order"", which
    seem far more concerned with creating a sound rather than doing something with
    that sound. The latter of the two takes textural experimentation too far,
    including a loop of some sort of scraping noise that drives me up the wall.</p><p>
    Promise peeks out of first song ""Cat Track (He Has No Balls)"", which begins inauspiciously with Wisternoff playing the exact same melody
    he's singing on his acoustic guitar, but briefly breaks into a careening
    midsection led by a dagger-sharp violin phrase that sounds like it could have
    come off a mid-1970s King Crimson record. It veers back to an acoustic
    arrangement before a thrashing coda, manipulating pop form in an interesting
    way while wielding sharp dynamic shifts, but it's ultimately not terribly memorable. 
    </p>
<p>
    Wisternoff's tendency to double his vocals with keyboard, guitar or violin
    is one of the things that holds the album back. It's partly because the tunes
    are too basic and static, but it's also the fact that there's usually only one
    thing going on at a time, and one thing isn't enough with this kind of music.
    ""Geography (Donkey Dancing in the Bath)"" only gets interesting when
    he hands the vocal melody off to a solo trumpet and ramps up the arrangement
    with bashing drums. 
    </p>
<p>
    The best song on the album is the one that doesn't feel like it belongs
    here: ""Halfway up the Pathway"" is a solo acoustic number recorded in
    the most rudimentary fashion, but it has a fantastic vocal with a Syd Barrett
    feel and Wisternoff's strumming is spry and lively. It's just about perfect,
    but Wisternoff doesn't seem to agree, uselessly appending a coda that consists
    of the rest of the song annoyingly chopped to bits and mixed up. 
    </p>
<p>
    Though it has its moments, they're not enough to save <em>Wrong-Faced Cat Feed
    Collapse</em> from mediocrity. Wisternoff certainly knows how to handle timbre and
    tone, but without marrying them to song, he's created an overly uniform record
    that doesn't stick.

    Between them, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Ray Price have been recording and touring for more than
    150 years: Nelson made his name as a DJ and songwriter in the 1950s,
    when Ray was establishing his own career as a smooth crooner and Haggard
    was getting ready to parlay his prison experience into one of the most
    successful country careers of the 60s and 70s. During that time they've
    collaborated repeatedly, most notably on Nelson and Haggard's <em>Pancho &amp; Lefty</em> in 1980 and Nelson
    and Price's <em>San Antonio Rose</em> in 1990
    and <em>Run That By Me One More Time</em> in
    2003. They're so woven into the
    fabric of country music and popular culture that the title <em>Last of the Breed</em> doesn't come off as a self-aggrandizing boast.</p><p>
    In fact, that title might as well apply to the 22 tracks on
    this 2xCD set instead of the artists singing them. Besides the two new-ish compositions
    by Nelson and Haggard, these songs are calculable in age by decades, credited to
    the swinging pens of Cindy Walker, Lefty Frizzell, Floyd Tillman, Jesse
    Ashlock, and Harlan Howard, among others. In such company, Kris Kristofferson,
    represented here by ""Why Me"", counts as a young buck. These are simple, direct songs with easy melodies, witty lyrics, and true-to-life
    sentiments-- generally perceived to be the kind spurned by mainstream country
    musicians.  Nashville still has its
    share of talented songwriters, but the myth of the good ol' days is
    nice and reassuring, allowing listeners to disregard contemporary country
    wholesale.</p><p>
    On <em>Last of the Breed,</em>
    which accompanies a well-received joint tour with Asleep at the Wheel as
    their backing band, these three grizzled vets sound supremely comfortable, trading verses and songs with easy camaraderie. Even at 81, Price
    still sounds robust, especially on ""My Life's Been a Pleasure"", and the
    grizzled texture just adds seen-it-all authority to Merle's voice, especially
    on his new composition ""Sweet Jesus"". Willie's infamous against-the-meter phrasing
    has always sounded extemporaneous, as if even he doesn't know what his voice
    will do next; even when he slurs his lines on ""My Mary"" and ""Mom and Dad's
    Waltz"", he still shows an intuitively loose control that hasn't diminished with
    age. Their distinct voices combine gracefully on ""Sweet Memories"" and ""I
    Love You Because"", but they sound best on Kristofferson's ""Why Me"". That song
    has always seemed like a solitary prayer (especially on Johnny Cash's
    lonely American Recordings version), but sung by a veteran trio, it almost
    sounds like a career retrospective, as if they're humbled by their large
    audience, long legacies, and close friendship. 
    </p>
<p>
    Producer Fred Foster, returning after Nelson's 2006 Cindy
    Walker tribute, shows a light touch on these songs, creating a light, loping
    backdrop that lacks the snap of his previous work. Despite the presence of a
    crack backing band that includes pedal steel master Buddy Emmons and backing
    vocals by the Jordanaires, <em>Last of the
    Breed</em> never seems as good as it should be: there are fine versions of
    strong songs, but not a single definitive take. ""Lost Highway"" comes close, as
    do ""Heartaches by the Number"" and ""Goin' Away Party"", but most of these songs
    sound like the trio are trying to re-create a style long past rather anchor
    these songs in the here and now. That retrospective orientation is strange because
    none of these artists could be accused of being stuck in the past; in fact,
    their willingness to adapt to new styles without compromising their standards
    is partly what makes them the last of their breed. So it's a shame <em>Last of the Breed</em> isn't better-- not
    only do they have a lot to say about these old songs, they also have a lot to
    say through them.

    Along with the Incredible String Band and Fairport Convention, Pentangle was one of the major pioneering forces to first put British folk-rock on the map in the 1960s, and their distinctive hybrid of folk, blues, and jazz has-- for better and sometimes worse-- subsequently inspired countless musicians to follow their progressive trail. Despite their legion of disciples, however, their true influence has always been tempered by the fact that few groups could hope to duplicate Pentangle's unique chemistry or sheer instrumental prowess, attributes which are in lavish display on the mammoth 4xCD retrospective <em>The Time Has Come: 1967-73</em>.</p><p>
    Pentangle's music has been frequently anthologized over the years, including-- confusingly enough-- on two separate compilations entitled <em>Light Flight</em>. And while it can't be said to be entirely comprehensive, <em>The Time Has Come</em> does provide a balanced portrait of the freewheeling group's six-year career. Extensively illustrated and annotated, the collection features excerpts from each of their studio albums, re-mastered singles and B-sides, as well as the requisite passel of previously unreleased live tracks and rarities. Containing nearly five hours of music and packed with a variety of astonishing curios, the set ultimately manages to feel rather definitive, and does well to capture Pentangle in all their brilliance, self-indulgent excess, and period splendor.</p><p>
    By the time Pentangle formed in 1967, guitarists Bert Jansch and John Renbourn were already well-established talents on the English folk scene. The two had previously issued an album together as a duo, utilizing what became known as a ""folk baroque"" fingerpicking style that drew heavily upon the influence of innovative British folk guitarist Davy Graham. Joining them to round out Pentangle was vocalist Jacqui McShee, who was also an experienced performer on the folk circuit, and the veteran jazz rhythm section of double bass player Danny Thompson and drummer Terry Cox. 
    </p>
<p>
    Once so assembled, Pentangle's core quintet were capable of an extraordinary versatility, and quickly proved themselves equally adept at covering 17<sup>th</sup> century English folk ballads, Charles Mingus' ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"", or the Jaynetts girl-group classic ""Sally Go Round the Roses"". Moreover, Pentangle's ability to transverse musical boundaries soon became so seamless and organic as to be almost invisible, as when Renbourn delicately weaves an exotic sitar line through the group's version of the traditional English ballad ""Cruel Sister"". And though many of their bold stylistic moves have since been rendered into coffeehouse cliché by lesser talents, there are still many moments of dazzling invention and surprise to be discovered all across <em>The Time Has Come</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    The collection's first two discs are assembled chronologically, interspersing album tracks with various outtakes, BBC sessions, and non-album rarities. This arrangement surely caused the set's curators to make some tough calls and quirky decisions, such as leaving off the studio versions of many of Pentangle's better known songs (""Let No Man Steal Your Thyme"", ""Sally Free and Easy"") and drastically editing down their 1970 side-long epic ""Jack Orion."" Nevertheless these two discs do an admirable job illustrating the gradual evolution of Pentangle's remarkable chemistry. On early tracks ""Waltz"" and ""Travelling Song""-- both recorded at the time of Pentangle's 1968 debut album-- the group sound tentative, feeling its way around incorporating its diverse sonic elements. 
    </p>
<p>
    By the time of such 1969's <em>Basket of Light </em>and 1970's<em> Cruel Sister</em>, however, Pentangle were operating as an incomparable whole, with McShee's frequently sublime vocals perfectly complemented by Jansch and Renbourn's atmospheric guitar work. The group's easy compatibility is particularly evident on the set's live material, such as on a version of <em>Basket of Light</em>'s ""Hunting Song"" which was recorded at BBC for John Peel's <em>Top Gear</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    Longtime Pentangle fans will likely have something of a mixed reaction to <em>The Time Has Come</em>'s third disc, which consists of a live concert recorded at Royal Festival Hall in June, 1968. Twelve of the concert's songs were originally released on 1968's <em>Sweet Child</em> double album, and seven others were included on a 2001 re-master of the album. Here the tracks have been re-sequenced and cleaned up, with much of the between-song banter and applause removed. Though this remains a solid performance, this set might feel a tad redundant to anyone already familiar with <em>Sweet Child</em>, and more impatient listeners might find themselves wishing the producers had also seen fit to edit out a bass solo or two. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Time Has Come</em> reserves its real treasure trove for last, as the final disc is entirely filled with previously unreleased material, most of which is of an uncommonly high caliber. Several of these unearthed tracks were recorded live for various TV broadcasts between 1970-72, and find the group at their most dynamic and expansive. In fact, on some of these performances, Pentangle begin to almost resemble an British response to the Grateful Dead, an impression that is further amplified by their live version of the longtime Dead staple ""Cold Rain and Snow"". This comparison is likely most valid on the live, 19-minute interpretation of the group's signature ""Pentangling"", whose electric figures and wayfaring improvisations can sound much more in line with the Avalon Ballroom than the English countryside. 
    </p>
<p>
    Most curious of all is the set's inclusion of not one but two title works from film soundtracks, ""Tam Lin"" and ""Christian the Lion"", that were digitally pieced together from individual verses used as in the films as a narrative device. Needless to say, the practice of using ethereal folk songs as a cinematic framing device is one that has sadly gone out of fashion, and the presence of these offbeat tracks reinforces the impression of Pentangle as a group who were wholly and intrinsically of their time. And though echoes of the group's artistic legacy still resonate in Jansch's current solo work, and in the music of such younger artists as Espers, Devendra Banhart, and Vetiver, <em>The Time Has Come</em> should stand as further evidence that we'll not soon see Pentangle's like again.

Remember suicidal depression in November, a whole summer spent watching VH1's ""I Love the 90s"", and the swift and vicious post-2 Many DJs backlash against ""eclectic"" DJ mixes? Well three years later, I'm still loving this tendency in 21st century mixology to just play whatever <em>sounds</em> good, regardless of genre or year of release. Besides, backlash comes and goes. The deserved acclaim thrown at the feet of Scottish duo Optimo is proof that even grouchy grousers have grown more comfortable with a generation of DJs out to keep on unearthing cool old music. All they're trying to do is <em>share</em>, you know.</p><p>
    Optimo's JD Twitch lent a hand with the recording for Justine D's <em>Mx5</em>, the latest mix CD from New York's Rvng boutique, following top shelf limited edition discs from Crazy Rhythms (the duo of Dan Selzer and Mike Simonetti) and DFA duder Tim Sweeney. Unlike Optimo's mixes-- potentially deadly acts of multi-track chainsaw juggling pulled off with the blithe, dizzying panache of assured showmen-- Justine D blends and bleeds across eras with just your traditional DJ fades and chops, while still casting a wide net for cool records. A jury of cranky dance music fans might look at the tracklist for <em>Mx5</em> and simply conclude ""eclectic,"" but I'm fairly comfortable saying it's the first mix CD to ever feature Chic, Crass, <em>and</em> the Cars.</p><p>
    But like kohl around the eye, Justine D traces a small, dark spot on the dancefloor where flamboyant goth-pop, haughty electro(clash), hypnotic techno, rigid EBM, concrete block German new wave, skeletal punk, and glam-era Bowie all intersect. (She takes a short side trip at the start for a little shoegaze'n'sitars psychedelic baggy.) It's a mid-tempo nighttime stroll through various districts of black-clad clubland, dour disco for dancing in place. Not for nothing does she choose the strings from the most zombie-zonked of Chic tracks, the ravenous but exhausted plea of ""I Want Your Love"". The smashed neon and burnt chrome of <em>Mx5</em>'s proto-techno and bleak disco could be the soundtrack to <em>Blade Runner</em>'s wayward replicant Priss, lost on 2014's Hollywood Boulevard Babylon.
    </p><p>
    Despite contemporary DJs and mp3 blog culture making formerly forbidden found sounds like Mick Fleetwood afro-disco tracks and Alan Parsons Project album cuts cool for old punkers and nu-ravers alike, many are still wary of anything tagged in iTunes as ""goth"" or ""industrial."" My primary introduction to dance music came from an older girlfriend who had grown up and through the succession of 80s electronic beat music, from synthpop to industrial, hitting New York after college just as house music did. Listening to <em>Mx5</em> brought back some pretty uncanny memories from the years we dated-- learning about Nitzer Ebb and the Orb at the same time, getting into arguments about Ministry on the subway, slowly shedding my prejudices via rock- and foot-friendly bands like Christian Death that all goth had be a) Slow, and b) Terrible. (All of my fellow My Chemical Romance fans are urged to check out <em>Only Theatre of Pain</em>.)
    </p>
<p>
    All of those artists are on <em>Mx5</em>, snug in the DJ box next to more expected fare such as Hot Chip, Delia and Gavin, and Italian synth-soundtrack maestros Goblin-- whose nightmarish combo of distant drums, music box chimes, gargling vocals, and death-folk guitar is the creepiest thing on the disc, and that's <em>before</em> it turns into a funk rock record produced by Giorgio Moroder in Grandpa Munster drag. Surprise, surprise-- it <em>all</em> sounds great. I'm not convinced enough to go trawling through the Wax Trax stax just yet, but isn't that why we keep DJs around, to find these shiny lumps of coal? ""Beware the savage lure of 1984,"" Mr. Bowie seems to be warbling on the song of the same name, but that's very poor advice on the evidence of <em>Mx5</em>.

Instead, it belongs to the Atlanta producer Polow Da Don. Polow produced or co-produced more than half of the album's songs, and he's releasing the album on Zone 4 Inc., his vanity label.  Polow already has a few pop hits on his résumé (the Pussycat Dolls' ""Buttons"", Fergie's ""London Bridge"", Ciara's ""Promise""), but this album is really his coming-out party, the moment where his style hits its groove and becomes a singular aesthetic; even the album tracks that Polow didn't produce seem to exist in the universe he's created here.</p><p>
    Polow's style exists somewhere between the epically futuristic space-pop opuses of Timbaland and the more humid, organic sounds of melodic mid-1990s Southern rap producers like Organized Noize and Pimp C. Polow starts ""Throw Some D's"", the hit first single, with a light, ethereal electric piano that dissolves into swollen strings and thudding drums. Later, playful synth-beeps find their way into the mix, floating above the guttural soul. While most rap producers let tracks resolve themselves by the first chorus, Polow tends to keep piling on new elements throughout until the song turns into a claustrophobic mini-symphony. His hard and aggressive tracks are usually light and pretty. His light and pretty tracks are usually hard and aggressive. And he has a way of coaxing every little piece of the track out so that it complements every other part.</p><p>
    As for Rich Boy, more often than not he's just another piece in Polow's puzzles. By any standard, Rich Boy isn't a particularly remarkable rapper, something that becomes painfully apparent every time a great rapper like Pastor Troy or Big Boi shows up to make a cameo. Rich Boy rarely breaks out of standard rapper tropes about cars and sex and money (""Do the G-thing in ya G-string/ I won't even pay attention to the wedding ring""), and even when he indulges his conscience, the results are pretty dismal. ""Lost Girls"", for instance, is an innocence-gone-astray lament like Ludacris' ""Runaway Love"" except dumber, if you can even imagine that. But he's got a huge, swampy Mobile drawl, the sort of accent that might sound exotically Southern even if you weren't born north of the Mason-Dixon line. Most of the time, he's just another ingredient in Polow's cluttered mixes, and his heavy, stretched-out croak does a good job bridging the expanses in those tracks, which is all he really needs to do. When he shows promise, as on the heated, anguished rant ""Let's Get This Paper"", it's a bonus. But he mostly just lets the beats do their job, a smart decision on his part.</p><p>
    The album's stunning, high-impact production fits it into the recent tradition of epic, monolithic Southern-rap albums like Young Buck's <em>Straight Outta Ca$hville</em> and Young Jeezy's <em>Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101</em>, but more than those albums, it's the work of one idiosyncratic creative mind. Polow da Don is just now finding his voice, and he's got a great career ahead of him. If Rich Boy is lucky, he'll stay along for the ride.</p></div>"|9996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9996-rich-boy/|7.5|Tom Breihan

You've almost got to love how unpitchable the Dead Science are, as anyone trying to encapsulate them ends up sounding like an arse: Mutant showtunes for an anarchic codeine cabaret! Murder ballads for a no-wave speakeasy! Prom jams for masochistically patient goths! Grownup, tortured slow-burn music about teenage longing, like a less poppy Twilight Singers or Arab Strap, except taking dissonant turns (via chords that might be considered mistakes by one's old strip-mall guitar tutor) into neighborhoods patrolled by Dominique Leone! Oh yeah, with a vocalist who sounds like PJ Harvey's corpse somehow revived in a nitrous oxide tank, or an emphesemic Hedwig trying to fearfinger a Jimmy Scott fleshlight, or, er, Prince bound and gagged singing through a Miss Piggy costume... So: if the Junior Boys went analog and were sicker fucks?</p><p>
<em>Crepuscule</em> contains two loping songs from the <em>Frost Giant</em> sessions that would have brought that record's fever down, one of which is a funereal rendition of a composition by the ever-depressed John Dowland-- yes, the lutenist from four hundred years ago whom Sting just revisited for an album. Of the newer material, ""Displacer Beast"" comes closest to being a manifesto for this trio's ambitions, homaging the classic belligerent, perception-bending hybrid monster from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and wishing for even more disorienting power: to be ""something else forever.""</p><p>
    The remaining tracks pivot on sweet shocks, an organ squall here and a sustained howl there, best listened to instead of typed about, lest one be forced to trot out pairs of opposites such as ""fluid and impenetrable"" or ""desiccated and elegant"" to describe them. Sam Mickens' lyrics are buried in his of-a-hellish-piece-with-the-music delivery; he may as well distribute burning valentines or print obituaries in inscrutable fonts. Sarah Meadows' three photographs for the packaging are just as slithery: Are the gender-indeterminate people that they depict dead in the woods, or just lying down? Interestingly removed, <em>Crepuscule</em> is by no means a leap back for the Dead Science; it's a sidestep into a shadowy alcove.</p></div>"|10046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10046-crepuscule-with-the-dead-science-ep/|6.8|William Bowers

    This Party""-- an amusing rendezvous
    between dancehall's Kopa riddim and samples of C+C Music Factory's ""Gonna
    Make You Sweat"", and by far last
    year's most perverse French house track-- revealed just how meaningless the
    separations between French house's underground and overground are. You won't
    hear anything like the Sinclair track on <em>Ed Rec 2</em>, Ed
    Banger's second label compilation, although it's not for lack of trying. The
    stumbling block is in their heads, perhaps: Whereas Ed Banger are stymied by
    the erroneous assumption that interesting ideas can only be realized at the
    expense of unambiguously seizing the pop jugular, Sinclar just went out and did
    both.</p><p>
<em>Ed Rec 2</em> reveals clearly enough the flaws in the label's
    aesthetic vision: resident rapper Uffie, already a dubious proposition, sounds
    positively execrable on her ode to haters, ""Dismissed"", but if this is by far
    the worst inclusion here, it's not (just) because Uffie can't rap. Blame the
    creative bankruptcy of the label's intermittent fascination with sneeringly
    amateurish, stuttery send-ups of old skool electro, which also ruins the Yoko
    Ono electro of DJ Mehdi's ""Lucky Girl"". These artists should, one and all, give
    up on trying to tell jokes. Luckily, most of <em>Ed Rec 2</em> witnesses the label roster in consolidation mode,
    staging a strategic retreat to the messy, rock-influenced take on French house
    which Daft Punk codified on <em>Human After All</em>. While the move invites accusations of redundancy,
    I'm inclined to look upon Ed Banger's reduced expectations with some sympathy. One needs to accept
    from the outset that Ed Banger are unlikely to produce something as
    all-conquering as ""Rock &amp; Roll"" or as marvelously confounding as
    ""Aerodynamic"" in order to fully enjoy the enthusiasm with which they go about
    colonizing the space between these two poles, from the ridiculous Genesis synth
    runs of Mr. Flash's ""Disco Dynamite"" to the rusted-on percussion presets of
    Feadz's lurching ""Edwrecker"".</p><p>
    And perhaps some of the
    elder statesmen's production nous has rubbed off as well. Justice's ""Phantom"" fuses hyper-plasticity with noise for noisiness'
    sake in characteristic fashion. While it's hardly surprising, it's perhaps the duo's best
    executed effort to date, the descent from disco sparkle into a mid-range black
    hole and back out again carried off with agility, even grace. Busy P's ""Rainbow
    Man"" may simply reiterate the same grinding, slow, mechanical house blueprint
    that Daft Punk established with ""Steam Machine"" and that SebastiAn has since
    made his own, but why should we expect more than good craftmanship? Why can't
    there be an entire genre of these menacingly sexy dominatrix backing tracks? By
    comparison, SebastiAn's own ""Greel"" is disappointingly
    lacking in character, its mechanic gewalt expressing brute force but nothing
    to give that power meaning.
    </p><p>
    Indeed, it's usually when Ed
    Banger's artists get dark-- rather than merely loud-- that they are most
    compelling. Far and away the best track on this compilation, Krazy Baldhead's
    ""Strings of Death"" performs the unlikely feat of summarizing the label's entire
    aesthetic while sounding like nothing else in its back catalogue, boasting the
    type of muscular rock groove that the label should have been cornering all
    along. Instead of settling for a straightahead churn or stomp, it slinks its
    way around overblown, bluesy guitar riffs while paranoid synths and snapping
    electro beats add a slight industrial inflection, somewhere between Ministry at
    their most lithe and Depeche Mode at their most heavy. It's actually thrilling,
    and I'd wager part of the thrill derives from the unexpectedness of the
    equation, as if industrial glam-rock is the unintended and explosive result of
    a naïve French House alchemy experiment. If Ed Banger can only stumble upon
    greatness by accident, let's hope the artists never work out exactly what it is
    they're doing on tracks like these.

Lyrically, ""Just Because"" isn't far from Eminem's deranged wife-murder fantasy ""Kim""; Devin raps to an ex-lover about all the various ways he wants to humiliate, torture, or kill her. Musically, though, it couldn't be further from Eminem's ominous crashes. Instead, it's a weird parody of dentists'-office adult-contempo, with sterile Kenny G sax-runs and glistening Richard Marx pianos. Devin raps all his graphic revenge scenarios in a sort of stoned mumble, something akin to the sensitive-thug coo LL Cool J used on ""I Need Love"": ""Get a hotel suite 20 stories above/ And chuck you out the window, watch you fly like a dove."" It's a hate song disguised as a love song, and that thin joke doesn't make it any more defensible.</p><p>
    And yet I still want to give Devin the benefit of the doubt. Over his three uniformly great previous albums, Devin has crafted one of the most likeable personas in rap, an unremittingly decent and dependably funny everyloser, rapping about his broken-down vintage Cadillac and his struggles to pay his bills with a soothingly melodic drawl and a wicked instinct for self-deprecation. Devin croons his crass pickup lines over fluttery beds of warm, organic tracks that balance their heavy, shuddering 808s with pianos and flutes and acoustic guitars. The euphorically laid-back funk has a way of dissipating into the air, allowing Devin's sly jokes and forthright introspection to sneak up on you. Devin's no stranger to nasty sex-raps, but more often than not he's the butt of his own jokes or the hapless victim of his drawn-out story-songs. And even at his most reprehensible, he's been shockingly free of venom. He draws more from ribald storyteller comedians like Richard Pryor and Rudy Ray Moore than from any rapper, and it's hard to stay offended when he plainly refuses to take himself seriously.</p><p>
    But on <em>Waitin' to Inhale</em>, the punchlines come a lot less frequently, and so do his comeuppances. On older records, he might've let loose with a line like this one, from album opener ""She Want That Money"": ""Bitch, you crazy; go wipe that cum out your nose/ Cuz you nothing but a money-hungry crumb-snatching ho""-- but he would've ended the song lying in a puddle of his own blood after the girl's brother paid him a visit. Now the other shoe never quite drops, and sometimes it should: On ""Cutcha Up"", he raps about wanting to fuck an underage girl. ""Hope I Don't Get Sick-A-This"" is a rough-sex memoir, something that would sound a whole lot natural coming from Lil Wayne or 8Ball or Redman. Those guys all have tough, commanding vocal presences; Devin delivers his lyrics in a calm, reasonable tone that somehow makes all his talk that much more disturbing.</p><p>
    On the evidence of a few later tracks, <em>Waitin' to Inhale</em> could be Devin's breakup album. ""No Longer Needed Here"" is a just-got-dumped lament, bitter but nuanced: ""Go  find that fountain of youth, that fantasy life/ Where you don't have to work on it to make it right."" On ""Don't Wanna Be Alone"", Devin eschews rapping for singing, crooning needy girl-don't-leave-me stuff. Right next to each other, those two songs would add up to a powerful picture of romantic desperation, but ""Just Because"" comes right in between them and seriously compromises the effects of both. So maybe Devin is turning his personal anguish into angry music; he certainly wouldn't be the first. I'd prefer to think that his songs are more <em>about</em> misogyny than reflections of it. Devin's an avowed fan of 70s soft-rock, particularly James Taylor, and that guy certainly didn't blanch at portraying himself as an enormous asshole. Maybe <em>Waitin' to Inhale</em> finds John Updike's influence finally trickling down to Houston rap via Taylor, a development almost as potentially interesting as Lil Wayne's current sentimental-absurdist Kurt Vonnegut phase. But maybe I'm squirming around for excuses for Devin because I like him so much, so consider my recommendation to be a vote of confidence, but be prepared to get potentially grossed out if you delve into this album.</p><p>
    The number at the top of this page reflects a couple of other things, too: For one, this album is as musically pretty as anything Devin's ever done. The album unfolds as a beautiful whole, its miasmic funk relaxing into itself, never pushing too hard but never fading into the background completely either. And Devin still shows occasional evidence of the self-mocking spark he's always had; ""She Useta Be"" is a light, mellow track about a chance encounter with a girl who rejected him in high school: ""A hundred and fifty pounds and ten years later/ Seen her at the grocery store; she tried to holler at a playa.""</p><p>
    But the record's delirious peaks come when Devin leaves his own sexual frustration behind completely. ""What a Job"" is a warm and trenchant look at the absurdities in the career of a rapper, and it boasts the best Andre 3000 verse in years. And ""Lil' Girl Gone"" is a melodramatic lost-innocence number way prettier and more powerful than Ludacris's similarly themed ""Runaway Love"". Its weeping strings, cascading pianos and on-fire guest-verses by Lil Wayne and Bun B give the track a widescreen grandeur that the rest of the album coolly avoids, and its simple decency goes a long way toward making up for Devin's sins on the rest of the album. Why can't Devin be this good all the time?</p></div>"|10034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10034-waitin-to-inhale/|7.8|Tom Breihan

    Vieux Farka Touré's debut album is a transitional work, representing
    the passing of a standard from a father to a son. Some
    of Malian guitar legend Ali Farka Touré's final recordings are here on his son's debut, which takes the signature desert guitar style of Ali
    and subtly builds on it. It's difficult for a young musician to step out from the
    shadow a parent so revered in the same field, but to his credit Vieux is
    content to move slowly and find his own approach to the style.</p><p>
    Vieux and Ali play together on two tracks, and their interaction-- the son
    plays rhythm guitar and gives his father's unmistakable leads free reign, with
    interjections from ngoni player Bassekou Kouyaté-- is not surprisingly marked
    by deference and respect. ""Tabara"" is a slow and meditative
    instrumental spotlighted by a mellifluous lead from Ali, into which Vieux
    perfectly slips his minimal backing rhythm. The other collaboration,
    ""Diallo"", is a conversation between Vieux's wizened, parched vocals
    and Ali's electric guitar, which carries his distinctive pinched tone. The
    rhythm is propelled by hand percussion, which is this case means sound actually
    created by the hands, without drums or blocks.</p><p>
    As if to draw a line in the Saharan sand between father and son,
    ""Tabara"" is immediately followed on the record by ""Ana"", a
    song that unites Mali and Jamaica, bringing desert guitar to the funky upstroke
    of reggae. At first, it feels like a minor excursion, but then the horns and
    bassline hit and drive the groove home all the way for a stunningly effective
    synthesis of the humid and the arid. ""Courage"" features an even more
    thrilling fusion, beginning in a sort of desert modal jazz fashion, with an
    acoustic guitar part that recalls the bassline of Miles Davis' ""So
    What"", but jumping into a straight-ahead rock groove a minute and a half
    in. Guest vocalist Issa Sory Bamba lets loose a crazed melismatic wail worthy
    of the most full-throated muezzin, and later harmonizes with album co-producer
    Eric Herman while Hassey Sarré's violin-like njarka lets loose fluttering
    phrases that sound a bit like backwards guitars. 
    </p>
<p>
    At the other end of the spectrum lie Touré's two instrumental duets with
    another elder statesman of Malian music, kora virtuoso Toumani Diabaté.
    ""Touré de Niafunké"" and ""Diabaté"", both tributes to the
    respective families of the men, display a deeply subliminal connection between
    the musicians. Diabaté's kora playing is delicate and precise, his glissandos
    traversing Touré's rich guitar lines as if held to them by gravity. The two
    close the album with nine minutes of slowly churning mind-meld that shivers
    with intensity. 
    </p>
<p>
    Touré dedicates the whole album to the memory of his father, who clearly is
    the single greatest influence present here. Listening, though, it's obvious
    that the younger Touré is itching to move on, experiment, and build something
    new of his own. He's not far from something truly progressive on his debut, and
    there are moments where he blows down barriers with frightening ease. His
    father's legacy may loom large, but Vieux Farka Touré stands well on his own.

    and sloppy, perfectly capturing the excitement of picking up an
    instrument and making music on it.<span> </span>Some 25 years
    later, Kilgour seems to be growing older with the same enthusiasm and charm: His latest,<span> </span><em>The Far

    single buzzing drone.<span> </span>This is not music
    designed for instant gratification; it evolves slowly, and repeats
    frequently.<span> </span>Still, Kilgour knows to quit
    when he's ahead; ""Sun of God"", like the majority of tracks on <em>The Far Now</em>, clocks in at under three
    minutes.<span> </span>Many of these songs explore a
    single musical figure or idea with grace and restraint, fading out with minimal
    fanfare before they become dull or grating.</p><p>
    The relaxed tone of <em>The

    moments.<span> </span>A potentially schmaltzy string
    arrangement on ""On Your Own"" is tempered by the effortlessness of Kilgour's
    voice.<span> </span>Kilgour expertly tows line
    between artful familiarity and cliché, especially during the album's strong
    second half.<span> </span>""I'm Gonna Get Better
    Lately"" seamlessly merges twang and atmosphere.<span>
</span>""I Cut My Heart Out Once"" evokes the spare, impressionistic folk of
    Robyn Hitchcock.<span> </span>Instrumental album
    closer ""Out of the Moment"" brings to mind the dusty ambiance of Dirty Three,
    and packs enough subtle builds and dips to maintain its momentum over seven
    minutes.
    </p>
<p>
    Interestingly, <em>The Far
    Now</em> is quite possibly the most dated-sounding thing Kilgour has ever
    released.<span> </span>The album's instrumental
    textures and lyrical concerns (see, especially, ""Wave of Love"") are miles away
    from most contemporary music, let alone ""cool"" contemporary music. But more often than not, Kilgour crafts these anachronisms
    into artifacts of wistful nostalgia. <span> </span>With
    so many indie bands shooting for far-reaching and ""ambitious"" sounds, it's easy
    for something as unassuming as <em>The Far
    Now </em>to fall through the cracks.<span> </span>This
    is not revelatory music, nor does it seek to be.<span> </span>Instead, <em>The
    Far Now </em>evokes a kind of humble ease seldom heard these days, and rarely
    executed this well.

    Since severing their romantic (and creative) partnership in 2001, Royal
    Trux's Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema seem to have swapped artistic
    trajectories. On Trux classics like 1992's self-titled skull-and-bones album
    and 1993's <em>Cats and Dogs</em>, it was Hagerty who played the straight-man
    role, offsetting Herrema's abrasive elocution and leavening the band's
    sometimes-inscrutable avant-blues bricolage with soul-baring acoustic serenades
    (""Junkie Nurse"") and meaty FM-radio-ready riffs. But where Hagerty's
    recent Howling Hex releases find him reverting to the lo-fi,
    found-sound-fuckery of Royal Trux's earliest releases, Herrema's new band RTX
    picks up where latter-day Trux tracks like ""Waterpark"" left off--
    i.e., sandwiched between Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe on a 1981 Monsters of Rock
    bill.</p><p>
    Coming from an artist who'd spent over a decade revitalizing classic rock
    clichés in alien contexts, the straight-up denim-and-leather posturing of RTX's
    2004 debut <em>Transmaniacon</em> felt like an all too predictable progression
    (or rather regression), and the fact that it featured some rewrites of old Trux
    songs (""Shockwave Rider"" became ""Joint Chief"", ""Fear
    Strikes Out"" begat ""PB+J"") carried the implication that Herrema
    was struggling for inspiration in the absence of her long-time foil. However,
    with its opening title track, <em>Western Xterminator</em> suggests a promising
    return to the Trux tradition of album-to-album aesthetic 180s-- instead of the
    expected high-voltage guitar squeals we get an immersing, opium-den torch song
    guided along slowly by bongos and flute flourishes, Herrema investing its
    French-folk-song melody with a fading diva's empty-ashtray regret.</p><p>
    But if this introduction presents a retreat from the heavy metal parking
    lot, the rest of <em>Western Xterminator</em> returns to the usual spot and sets
    up a permanent trailer-home in it, with the 70s-Stones sleaze of Herrema's
    former band all but vanquished for a full-on 80s headbanger's ball pitched
    halfway between Sunset Strip flash and New Wave of British Heavy Metal thrash.
    Good thing, then, that Herrema not only has the hair for the job, but the voice
    too-- stripped of the Trux's heroin haze, she can pretty much pass for Stephen
    Pearcy from Ratt (which could be why she rewrote ""Round and Round""
    and called it ""Last Ride""). Guitarist Jaimo Welch is her de facto
    Hagerty, though his playing is less informed by Ornette Coleman's theory of
    harmolodics than the Eddie Van Halen theory of widdly-widdly-widdly. He'd
    rather impress the burnouts sitting in the back rows of the L.A. Forum than the
    editors of The Wire, and more power to him: In the foot-stomp crunch of
    ""Balls to Pass"" you'll find all the good riffs missing from the last
    Darkness album, and with ""Wo-Wo Din"" he makes a convincing argument
    that Sabbath's greatest moment wasn't ""Sweat Leaf"", but ""Symptom
    of the Universe.""
    </p>
<p>
    RTX are well-positioned to court an indie-rock populace that's become ever
    more comfortable embracing its inner hesher, but <em>Western Xterminator</em>'s
    production is just obtuse enough-- less arena rock than a transistor-radioed memory of arena rock-- to keep
    the band at a distance from the unironic mulletheads who'd probably dig their
    music the most. After all, you don't write a song like ""Restoration
    Sleep""-- with its ""Pour Some Sugar on Me""-styled brass-rail
    boogie and engagingly stoopid ""feels good!"" chorus-- unless you're
    aiming squarely for the Camaro crowd. RTX's brand of populist fist-pump metal
    benefits from this sort of direct delivery, but more often than not, Herrema
    lets her voice recede into the effects-pedaled riffs, rendering what should be
    the songs' focal point into a background sonic detail. ""Knightmare and
    Mane"", in particular, feels like a missed opportunity for a killer power
    ballad, as Herrema's phased-out vocals are too incomprehensible to elicit the
    raised lighters that its melancholic, grungy grind seems to warrant.
    </p>
<p>
    Herrema hasn't always needed special effects to give her voice presence--
    check the more heartfelt performances on the Trux's 1995 album <em>Thank You</em>,
    like ""(Have You Met) Horror James?""-- but her reliance on superfluous
    studio trickery all but guarantees that <em>Western Xterminator</em>'s airplay
    will be confined to college-radio when, with a more refined presentation, it
    could be blasting from the Z-Rock 101s of the nation. The latter scenario, of
    course, is contingent on Drag City blowing all its Joanna Newsom profits on a
    radio promoter, but it'd be nice if RTX could give us a chance to dream.

    At this point, it's no secret that Fountains of Wayne are
    not the world's best lyricists.<span> </span>I could
    fill this review with forced, awkward, and downright embarrassing lines from <em>Traffic and Weather</em>, but few people are looking
    to this band for lyrical wit and insight.<span> </span>Eleven years after releasing their excellent self-titled debut, Fountains of Wayne have found success doing one thing and
    one thing alone: serving bite-size and easy-to-swallow nuggets of cultural
    nostalgia.<span> </span>And they have the
    résumé to prove it; along with the shamelessly Cars-aping mega-hit ""Stacy's
    Mom"", primary songwriter Adam Schlesinger famously penned the songs for the Tom Hanks-directed 1996 film <em>That Thing You Do!</em> as well as providing songs for the recent Hugh
    Grant/Drew Barrymore vehicle <em>Music and
    Lyrics</em>.</p><p>
    Somewhere along the line, the band gave up on the slightly
    ramshackle charm that made their debut so exciting.<span> </span>With the addition of a professional backing
    band on 1999's <em>Utopia Parkway</em>,
    Schlesinger and co-songwriter Chris Collingwood no longer needed to strip each
    song down to its essential hook and mood.<span>
</span>Rather than evoking a playful sense of whimsy, the band was free to
    actually <em>recreate</em> the sound of rock
    music pasts, giving their subtler songs more muscle but also opening the door
    to some truly awful genre pastiche.</p><p>
    My biggest gripe with ""Stacy's Mom"" wasn't its obvious nod
    to ""Just What I Needed"" or its even more obvious lyrical flaws, but rather that
    the song's verses seemed like tossed-off filler to kill time before the big
    chorus.<span> </span>Apparently, they've taken the
    song's success to heart; at its best, <em>Traffic
    and Weather</em> sounds like a collection of big-hook choruses strung together
    with half-hearted chugging build-ups.<span> </span>At
    its worst... well, it's far and away the most forgettable thing
    the band has ever released. 
    </p>
<p>
    Opener and leadoff single ""Somebody to Love"" sets the tale
    of two lonely young urbanites to crunchy guitars and a big, disco-thumping
    chorus.<span> </span>It's chock full of cultural
    references (Coldplay, ""The King of Queens""),
    and succeeds in creating a generic sense of drama between verse and
    chorus.<span> </span>But, like most of <em>Traffic and Weather</em>, it ultimately comes
    down to a progression of easy and unmemorable musical choices.<span> </span>Yes, it ""works,"" but only in the way that a crummy sitcom
    or a slick Hollywood date movie works.
    </p>
<p>
    That said, ""Somebody to Love"" is one of the
    album's high points. <span> </span>""92 Subaru"", for instance, sounds
    like a remake of Adam Sandler's ""Piece of Shit Car"" minus the novelty.<span> </span>Elsewhere, the band seems to be veering increasingly
    towards stories and ""themes"" in their songs, and the results can be pretty
    nightmarish-- it's all forced structure and no payoff, like a joke stripped of its humor. And d<span></span>on't even get me started on ""Planet
    of Weed"".
    </p>
<p>
    We should expect much, much more from pop music than this kind of bullshit.<span></span> ""Yeah, but it's fun,"" or ""it works for what
    it is"" are merely excuses for mediocrity, which this album has in abundance-- none of these songs hit
    with the irresistible hook overload of their earliest work, or even of ""Stacy's Mom"". <span> </span>Fountains of Wayne have proven themselves capable
    songwriters, both as scrappy underdogs and as pop superstars, but <em>Traffic and Weather</em> finds them treading
    water in the worst possible way.

It's not typical pop song fodder, but Winehouse isn't a     typical pop singer. If she winds up as popular in the U.S. as she is at home in the UK, it'll be despite her     reluctance to embrace the monotonous realities of promotional mechanics. Oh, she'll talk, but there's no guarantee what she'll say. (Our favorite is her heckling of Bono at last year's Q Awards: ""Shut up, I don't give a fuck!"") She'll be scheduled to     perform, but there's no guarantee what she'll do, or even if she'll make it through the show. And she'll sing about her problems, but she won't give a shit what you think of them.</p>
<p>If this makes Winehouse read a little like Lily Allen,     that's not far off the mark. Both are larger-than-life singers who've found perfect vehicles for their outsized personalities. In Allen's case, it's a cocktail of pop, reggae, and     hip-hop, with a cigarette in hand; for Winehouse, it's soul,     jazz, and blues with a bottle of booze. Both pay tribute to their     influences, with Winehouse's lyrics featuring     shout-outs to Ray Charles, Donny Hathaway, and Slick Rick, and the two even share a     producer: Mark Ronson, who's also worked with everyone from Sean Paul and Macy Gray to Ghostface and Rhymefest.</p>
<p>But Winehouse is anything but a     Lily Allen doppelgänger. After all, soul and jazz music are typically considered the province of grownups, and while Winehouse could be accused of slipping on these styles like costumes, she imbues her music with a surprisingly genuine soulfulness.</p>
<p>Ronson's sneaky production provides most of     the album's wit: The old school backdrop to ""Me &amp; Mr. Jones"" is especially winking against couplets like ""What kind of fuckery is this? You made me     miss the Slick Rick gig."" But Winehouse's zingers (in that same song she     tells her subject ""'side from Sammy you're my best black Jew"") and profane     interjections (the title track begins ""He left no time to regret/ Kept his dick     wet"") are only an occasional thing as she travels a well-worn lyrical path to both clinical and romantic rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Songs like ""Love Is a Losing Game"" are full of     regret, even if Winehouse refuses to wallow entirely in self-pity. However, as one might expect following the declaration of ""Rehab"", Winehouse does spend     much of <i>Back to Black</i> on the defensive, trying to explain why     she's stayed with the same guy who's done her wrong, or, in the case of ""Wake     Up Alone"", why her ex gives her the night sweats (""I drip for him tonight,""     Winehouse less delicately puts it).</p>
<p>It's one of the eternal themes of soul music,     here spiced up with post-modern production where less forceful personalities     might have gone with strictly retro emulation. The references to girl groups,     northern soul, and ska are there, but no one would confuse these approximations (split evenly between Ronson and Salaam Remi, who produced Winehouse's     since-disowned debut) with the real thing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Winehouse has been blessed by a brassy voice that can transform even mundane sentiments into powerful statements.     She may be heartbroken, but she uses that ache, twisting the emotional scars to suit her songs-- and if she often seems like the masochistic recipient     of each knife twist, so be it.<span> </span>It's not until the album's final track, ""He Can Only Hold Her"", that     Winehouse finally switches from first person to third, the ""I""s and ""me""s     giving way to ""he""s and ""she""s, suggesting that she's finally become an objective observer, able to see her personal issues for what they are. ""He tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside never dies,""     she sings, and we can only assume from this new vantage that Winehouse has moved     on.</p></div>"|10032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10032-back-to-black/|6.4|Joshua Klein

    They don't make many bands like Pretty Girls Make
    Graves anymore. The Seattle quintet probably stopped being cool in a trendy
    sense around the time I got turned onto them, a bit after 2003's <em>The New Romance</em>. As great as that record
    was, it showed a band mellowing and growing up in a way that made their frantic
    2002 debut, <em>Good Health</em>, sound even
    better. Third album <em>Elan Vital</em> was even more mature, and now, this June, one of indie rock's best-named groups is set
    to break up. <em>And</em> I think I'm starting to go bald. Pretty fucking depressing.</p><p>
    But still not as depressing as all the limp indie pop copyists filling
    the Pitchfork mailbox. Good thing there's Montreal
    trio Land
    of Talk to keep rocking out in PGMG's harried post-hardcore idiom. Frontwoman
    Elizabeth Powell's smoldering, harmonically complex fretwork and assured vocals
    help distinguish Land
    of Talk from the
    multi-layered massiveness of their city's best-known indie collectives. Instead, think
    Toronto's
    Tokyo Police Club with less treble and no handclaps, the Strokes, or sci-fi. Originally released in Canada last year, Land
    of Talk's blogger-beloved debut mini-album
    should finally hit U.S.
    stores like an unseasonably hot North wind.</p><p>
    While the <em>Applause
    Cheer Boo Hiss EP</em> is a muscular record with gut-level riffs and fist-pumping
    choruses, it gets there anything but directly; you know you like it long before
    you know why. See, it's tough to know what Powell's <em>saying</em> half the time, and her guitar-playing overloads on melody so
    that it ends up communicating mostly mood-- in a year without Marnie Stern and Charlotte
    Hatherley, her chops might've been the story. The rest of the band stands out most
    clearly when the songs downshift from urgent release to tense restraint: drummer
    Bucky Wheaton's portentous cymbal falls and bassist Chris McCarron's undulating
    groove on finale ""Street Wheels"", for example.
    </p>
<p>
    More often, Land
    of Talk storm ahead with
    the night at their heels, escaping lethargic beginnings on ""Sea Foam""
    and getting buffeted by wind sound effects on ""Breaxxbaxx"". Somehow
    Powell finds a way to balance early Cat Power fragility and PJ Harvey
    volatility; whether mumbling indecipherably or singing about ""fuckin'
    around,"" girls who ""still piss their pants,"" or the dangers of
    drinking when already tired, she's always in command. Hard to believe she used to sing
    in a whispery pop group called Ele_K*. Then again, if Alanis Morissette taught us
    anything, it's that Canada
    is a land of reinvention. As PGMG's Andrea Zollo once observed, ""When I
    turn it up loud/ Yeah, nothing else matters.""

But apparently the band saw it as a beginning, reforming shortly after and releasing <em>Blood Run</em> in 2005. Taut and competent, the album didn't stain the Unsane legacy, but it didn't add anything either. And it certainly didn't disprove the theory that <em>Lambhouse</em> worked best as a tombstone.</p><p>
    The same goes for <em>Visqueen</em>, Unsane's first album for Mike Patton's Ipecac label. The trio's patented sound-- tightly wound punk-metal featuring slashing guitars, muscle-bound rhythms, and the throat-stripping screams of Chris Spencer-- remains intact, albeit in slicker form. The problem is that this style holds no surprises 18 years after Unsane first coined it. And the band seems uninterested in pushing its songwriting forward, sticking to familiar patterns that are well executed but wholly predictable.</p><p>
    This doesn't mean the dense guitar bombs of ""Last Man Standing"", the stair-climbing throb of ""This Stops at the River"", or the strident roar of ""Only Pain"" aren't entertaining. When not struggling too hard to compensate for mediocre tunes, Spencer's howls are compelling, and his slicing guitar cuts through nicely. Even <em>Visqueen</em>'s goofier moments, like the straining ""Windshield"" (whose guitar line is oddly reminiscent of the Cars' ""Moving in Stereo""), work in isolated doses.</p><p>
    But as a whole <em>Visqueen</em> collapses under the weight of its own immobility. A few tracks in, everything blends into a vague blur: Spencer's cadences repeat, Vinny Signorelli's drumbeats get cloned, and Dave Curran's bass fuzz bleeds across songs. Maybe it's just album-length fatigue that makes later cuts like the lethargic ""Line on the Wall"" and the middling-tempo ""Disdain"" sound so exhausted, but it's difficult to imagine any context in which they would exhilarate.</p><p>
    Unsane throws its first curve on the final track, ""East Broadway"", an eight-minute grinder that strips things down to a vocal-less, minimalist pulse.  But even that track outlasts its own inspiration, looping out into a bored, empty denouement. For the Unsane fanatic uninterested in variations on the band's well-worn theme, the album won't disappoint, and there's no shame in wanting more of the same. But there are enough interesting updates and original takes on this kind of sound out there that <em>Visqueen</em> can be recommended only to diehards, if at all.</p></div>"|10030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10030-visqueen/|5.0|Marc Masters

    Despite the fact that the name Tarnation hasn't graced a CD
    spine in more than a decade, this isn't really a reunion. For one thing,
    Tarnation were primarily a vehicle for Georgia-born, San Francisco-based Paula
    Frazer, who migrated to art-country after the dissolution of her Bay Area punk
    outfit Frightwig disbanded in 1992. Furthermore, besides Frazer, no one from any
    of Tarnation's previous albums plays on <em>Now
    It's Time</em>. In fact, several of these performers backed her on her last solo
    album, <em>Leave the Sad Things Behind</em>-- particularly
    multi-instrumentalist Patrick Main, Frazier's primary collaborator.</p><p>
    It's more than just semantic, though. <em>Now It's Time</em> doesn't sound like a Tarnation reunion for the simple
    reason that this band doesn't sound like Tarnation. On <em>Gentle Creatures</em> in 1995 and <em>Mirador</em>
    in 1997, Frazer and her coterie of alternating Tarnaters made an unholy racket
    in the reverently quiet halls of alt-country, drenching spaghetti western guitars
    and high-lonesome vocals in canyon reverb-- more Morricone than Parsons or
    Cash. So <em>Now It's Time</em> is just
    another Frazer solo album. Nothing wrong with that, except that it makes the
    album's double billing seem particularly redundant.</p><p>
    Over the course of a decade and two solo albums, the old
    weirdness streaking through the 90s Tarnation albums-- which essentially made
    eerie atmosphere a punk pursuit-- has gradually ossified into a gentler, less
    remarkable listening experience: The punk element has all but disappeared,
    leaving only easy atmosphere. The music on <em>Now
    It's Time</em> is minimal and restrained, occasionally striking but mostly
    polite and tasteful. The songs have their distinguishing musical characteristics--
    piano on ""Bitter Rose"", dulcimer on ""Shadows""-- but they all strike the same
    vaguely mournful note and so tend to blur together. Things finally come
    together on the title track, which is drenched in welcome reverb and shows
    Frazer testing the limits of her voice, pushing its range so that it strains on
    the high notes. That's the only time when the lyrics and melody truly challenge
    the singer, but that's the second-to-last track on the album, so she cannot
    build on the moment.
    </p>
<p>
    For many, Frazer's voice is the main draw to any of her
    albums, whether they bear her own name or Tarnation's. Her puncturing twang has
    softened over the year, but she remains as nimble as ever. Like the bird
    pictured on the album cover, she flutters in her upper register, light and
    lonesome, especially on ""First Sign"" and ""Another Day"". When she sings low, her
    voice becomes sharp and testy-- an interested contrast that she never pursues
    satisfactorily. With no strong songs to give it shape and no compelling music
    to give it purpose, Frazer's vocals sound lovely but a little distant, which is
    the curse of the album itself. <em>Now It's

    James Dewitt Yancey probably toasted the arrival of 2003 with a champagne bottle in one hand and a middle finger aimed over his shoulder on the other. 2002 was the year he abandoned his previous recording moniker-- Jay Dee-- so Jermaine ""J.D."" Dupri wouldn't get his phone calls by mistake, as well as the year the newly-rechristened J Dilla left his longtime group Slum Village and set his sights on getting some of that major label exposure.  Unfortunately, MCA Records wound up permanently shelving his two major projects (a still-unreleased solo album and a record he produced for fellow Detroiters Frank-N-Dank, the oft-bootlegged <em>48 Hours</em>), while the most prominent album he had a hand in-- Common's <em>Electric Circus</em>, which featured his co-production on several tracks-- was widely ridiculed by critics and fans as a pretentious mess.</p><p>
    Maybe he took it all in stride, but the first album of new material that Dilla released in 03 didn't entirely show it. There was a noticeable sense of sub-surface tension in his <em>Ruff Draft</em> EP: Dilla's spoken intro crackles with a certain reactionary intensity when he states that the record is ""real live shit...sounds like it's straight from the motherfuckin' cassette,"" and the increasingly raw, psychedelic-soul tone that his beats set feels like a subtle but deliberate shift in perspective. Even the name hints at a plan to redraw his schematics and push away from what might have been the onset of an industry-bullshit-driven creative rut. The fact that <em>Ruff Draft</em> was pressed only on vinyl and distributed in limited numbers meant that this shift wouldn't manifest itself to a wider extent until his Madlib collaboration <em>Champion Sound</em>. By the time that album was released later in 03, the rawness had fully set in to his warm, soul-clap funk, so <em>Ruff Draft </em>eventually wound up one of independent hip-hop's great lost transitional-phase documents. It's been over a year since Dilla's passing, and since his legend continues to spur a demand for underheard, rare, or repurposed material, Stones Throw's reissue of <em>Ruff Draft</em> comes at an ideal time.</p><p>
    Considering where Dilla was at during this record's creation, honing and refining a more underground-hardcore edge to his craft, it's not a huge stylistic leap back from his most recent output. But if this EP stands up as more than just a filled-in blank, it's probably because what few songs there are at the core-- only eight full-length tracks, with all but two under 2:45-- tend to pack a lot of heat into a little space. Anyone who picked up last year's Stones Throw comp <em>Chrome Children</em> has already heard the highlight of this set, a dope-haze banger called ""Nothing Like This"". The track rides on a backwards acid-rock guitar loop, Dilla's haltingly sung-shouted, methodically rhythmic lovestruck testifying (""you-showed-me, the, light, uh-huh/got-to-have, you, right, a-way"") and a massive beat that trades his tendency for billowy-soft percussive dampening for a bassbin-destroying Goliath stride. For something that only lasts two and a half minutes and feels about a minute shorter, it's instantly captivating. </p><p>
    And there's a handful of other tracks that could easily justify a purchase for any Dilla fiend: ""Reckless Driving"" features the producer/MC quoting Biggie's ""Hypnotize"" and spitting windows-down whip-appeal verses; the production relies heavily on a droning space-goth synth, which gives the track a retro feel-- but retro when, exactly, feels elusive. East Coast hardcore tribute ""Make'em NV""-- which samples verses from M.O.P.'s ""Ante Up (Robbing-Hoodz Theory)""-- captures the early 90s NYC production grime that turned soul-jazz and fusion into some of the most sinister, cinematic hip-hop ever made, but does it with a vibe/xylophone sound that strongly resembles the incidental music from ""The Flinstones"". And ""Wild"" is a ridiculous gimmick turned moment of brilliance: a raspy little kid belts Slade's ""Cum on Feel the Noize"" over a stitched-together drum break that sounds sick in both senses of the word, but once the borderline-subliminal murmur of the electric piano and snap-clap rhythm come in, everything falls into place-- it's as though the toddler-sung ""Guns of Brixton"" interlude from the Clash's <em>Sandinista!</em> suddenly transformed into a lo-fi circa-99 Neptunes demo. 
    </p>
<p>
    But even with a few other quality club/sitting-around-in-your-basement-getting-high tracks (especially ""Crushin' (Yeeeeaah!)"", which turns his Ummah-era smoothness into slick let's-fuck rowdiness), <em>Ruff Draft</em> still feels like a limited-edition collectors-only curiosity. Even with some previously unreleased bonus tracks and an extra disc featuring instrumental versions of all the songs, it's a bit slight on content. (Not to mention that using two CDs for under an hour's worth of music seems like the definition of pointless-- but at least it costs the same as a single disc.) And even though Dilla's ability on the mic fits comfortably enough into the tone of his productions-- iced-out club rap buried under a layer of static and noise that makes it feel like a bootleg 4th-generation version (""straight from the motherfuckin' cassette"" is right)-- it sometimes comes across as a bit half-formed, especially in light of his subsequent, somewhat more polished performances on <em>Champion Sound</em>.</p><p>
    Still, there's something about eBay-bait and elusive micropressings that practically demand to be listened to once they reach the mass market. And whether or not Dilla would've eventually reissued this if he hadn't passed away, having another, scarcely-heard handful of his tracks readily available to a wider audience isn't something that can be easily dismissed, no matter how sparse the offerings are. Now all we need to do is get someone to call up MCA's people and get them to crack open their vaults.<br/>

When it comes to consumer technology, you just have to throw up your hands at some point. My discman finally died its death a month or so back, and I was forced to buy an iPod I couldn't really afford. If I'm honest, I caved mostly because the idea of buying a new discman in 2007 was too ridiculous to contemplate. I would have been laughed out of Best Buy. Aesthetics are a little bit different. I continue to wear Chuck Taylors and Vans because I'm as turned off now by extraneous bells-and-whistles as when I was when griping like a 14-year-old Andy Rooney about all the lights and pumps and gels. So I guess sneakers were my inchoate introduction to refusenik simplicity. And if you still want to be cheesily ostentatious, a pair of snakeskin Chucks or slip-ons with stupid flames airbrushed on them are a lot more honest than a goddamn Identi-Kit basketball shoe with a bunch of pointless and ""modern"" plastic gewgaws.</p><p>
    Like the late 20th century output of your neighborhood Foot Locker, my recent distaste for electronic music stems from a sterile slickness imposed by the march of technology colliding with an aesthetic asceticism-- an over-articulation of an extremely limited language. Too much ""minimal"" sounds both conceptually thin and sonically fussy. Listening to the new 2xCD <em>Book of Dogma</em>, a collection of rare EPs by famed but obscure proto-IDM act the Black Dog, I was struck on the first few listens by a joyous simplicity that manages never to sit still. Take ""Seer and Sages"", which, over a beat that never deviates from its two loud thwacks, shifts from boogaloo house pianos to techno synthesizers recast as ""Baby Elephant Walk"" baseball stadium muzak to an agitated rave spasm of pure noise to an outro as delicate as anything off a Kompakt <em>Pop Ambient</em> LP.</p><p>
    If, as with the crude, cut-up New York house and sparkling Detroit techno they were inspired by, time has somewhat dulled the shine of the Black Dog's sonics, it's also made the music sound more direct and engaging than ever by cultural contrast. To flip another non-musical metaphor, minimal can feel like the suspended animation slog of non-narrative avant-garde filmmaking in THX/IMAX fidelity, but these early Black Dog tracks are like a spelunking spaceman bounding happily through the corny, color-saturated landscape of a no-budget 1980s sci-fi flick with a cranked-up soundtrack of post-Kraftwerk synths, sampled self-help gurus, cosmic divas, distant dog howls, and chirping wind-up birds. Though <em>Book of Dogma</em> comes wrapped in the chilly graphics of a Depeche Mode album, this at times gaudy music, with its barreling melodies and shouting rappers, isn't afraid to get loud in your face; it sounds like an oddball party crasher in glassy, reserved 2007.
    </p><p>
    This out-of-step quality isn't terribly surprising; as the first decade of the 2000s winds to a close, the electronic music of the early 90s, be it of the smarty pants or party hard variety, feels as distant as ""Models Inc."" or Homer Simpson's beloved clear cola. In the light of everything from the rainbow-hued syncopation of 2-step garage to Perlon's thousand dry timbres of percussion, the Dog's very first EP <em>Virtual</em>-- the first three tracks on disc one of <em>Dogma</em>-- sounds stark, like staring into the tie-dye-cum-Rorschach pattern on the original's vinyl label as it spins on your turntable: revolving breakbeat patterns overlaid with creaky synths. But its bold if basic boom-bap is totally appealing, even on the more hi-fi second disc when the trio begins to swing their beats into crunching triplets as on the broken beat foreshadowing ""Vanttool"" or whatever the hell the stop-start lurching astro-samba of ""Erb"" is. ""The Age of Slack"", from the 1989 EP of the same name, is zonked electronic funk with shuffling beats straight off a Rob Base record and bursts of sampled rap; its woozy atmosphere-- that faded soul singer makes the whole thing sound like a stoned take on <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</em>-- slows you down, creating a very different kind of ""slacker"" vibe than contemporaneous Superchunk. I mean, what better way to describe the Dog's music than their own pointed, self-penned epigram ""Ambience with Teeth""?
    </p>
<p>
    Not everything on <em>Book of Dogma</em> sounds bound to some unrepeatable golden era for nostalgic ravers. ""Glassolalia"" is spare and dark enough to still be easily slotted into a DJ set, and listen to the intro to ""Techno Playtime"" and tell me that Mouse on Mars weren't listening hard. You might say it's silly to pit music from two very different decades against each other, especially considering I can be as much of a sucker for a well-done piece of shiny modern minimalism as anyone. But call me a crank or a grouch or hopelessly out of touch or more interested in aesthetic appeal than the march of technology-- I still can't shake my feeling that too much modern techno has been molded into a slick, aerodynamic Nike-sweatshop anonymity that's more fun to read about than listen to. Maybe it's less about being a luddite than about comfort and enjoyment. For folks too young or indifferent to be into 90s ""electronic listening music"" at the time, <em>Book of Dogma</em> may feel like a pair of ratty old sneakers, but try them on and I bet you they get worn a helluva lot more this year than the pair that's eye-catching in the catalog and hell on the feet.

Though the band's resonating torch had been carried forward by groups such as Sleep and Sunn0))), to diehards only Dylan Carlson held the master key to the eternal metal chord.</p><p>
    The anticipation was rewarded: Following a few releases hinting at new directions, 2005's <em>Hex, or Printing in the Infernal Method</em> was a true rebirth. Filled with lonesome tunes built around Carlson's clean, twangy guitar, the album painted pictures of windy ghost towns and moon-lit deserts, and owed as much to post-rock and country as metal and drone. Many songs evoked the cinematic instrumentals of Slint or Mogwai, but with Carlson's gift for Zen-like patience. No crescendos, flourishes, or denouements: Just simple guitar marching towards an infinite horizon.</p><p>
<em>Hibernaculum</em> is Earth's first release since then, but it's not a follow-up as much as a history lesson told through the prism of <em>Hex.</em> It includes a four-track CD with three old Earth tunes redone in the <em>Hex</em> style, and a DVD documenting the band's post-<em>Hex</em> European tour. Musically, it might not quite match its predecessor, but as an updated retelling of the Earth tale, <em>Hibernaculum</em> is fascinating.</p><p>
    The first two cuts on the CD are the most interesting. ""Ouroboros Is Broken"" began life as an 18-minute track on Earth's 1991 debut <em>Extra-Capsular Extraction</em>, a post-Sabbath growler full of fuzzy chords and machine-like drumbeats. Hibernaculum's eight-minute version is slower and dreamier, with Carlson's ""canyon bends"" shadowed nicely by the shuddering bass of Don McGreevy and quaking Korg of Sunn0)))'s Greg Anderson.  </p><p>
    Track two takes on ""Coda Maestoso in F (Flat) Minor"", a catchy rocker from Earth's 1996 ""pop"" album <em>Pentastar: In the Style of Demons</em>. Slowed to a glacial pace, the song becomes a desert mirage, turning each corner a few steps later than expected. Temporal illusion has long been a Carlson specialty, and here his frozen guitar web seems to hang in the air, eventually shining with the dewy gleam of Steve Moore's ringing piano. Throughout, Earth refuses to build to a climax or speed to a rush, wisely trusting that patience will be its own reward.</p><p>
    A similar minimalism marks Seldon Hunt's <em>Within the Drone</em>, a tour documentary shot last spring. Mixing Carlson's subdued musings with hypnotic live footage, the film never hurries or jumps, allowing Earth's music to speak for itself. Particularly clever is Hunt's choice to cut to different performances of the same song, making the tour feel like one long composition. Carlson's bites offer a few nice revelations-- an obsession with LaMonte Young, an abandoned follow-up to <em>Pentastar</em> that would've included horn and string sections-- but his best lines are as simple as his best songs. ""If you're gonna do slow and simple,"" he says in his wizened stoner drawl. ""It doesn't get much slower and simpler than the drone.""</p></div>"|10031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10031-hibernaculum/|7.8|Marc Masters

    The Fucking Champs' Tim Green, who has produced records for the Melvins, Six Organs of Admittance, and Comets on Fire, is clearly a guy who understands the finer points of heavy, retrofitted psych-rock. And this professional expertise comes in particularly handy on <em>Ekranoplan</em>, the second album from Bay Area trio the Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound. Following their self-released 2005 debut, which was limited to 500 copies, the group here gives all the familiar old Blue Cheer/Floyd/Elevators touchstones another thunderous and sympathetic throttle. Under Green's watchful care, the Assemble Head reach an appropriate balance between the spontaneous intensity of a live gig and a well-curated studio session, performing their passionate, formalist rock maneuvers with an accompanying waft of patchouli and beer-soaked denim.</p><p>
<em>Ekranoplan</em> takes its name from an enormous, low-flying Soviet transport used to shuttle troops beneath enemy radar during the Cold War. And though you'd likely have to live on the Caspian Sea to know for certain, one might reasonably assume that these monsters were able to generate a truly hellacious roar. If so, the Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound have tagged their work accurately, as this album achieves a deafening lift-off right from its opening chords and sustains its noisy trajectory throughout the duration of these nine tracks.<em> </em></p><p>
    As with such groups as Comets on Fire or Dead Meadow, the individual elements of the Assemble Head's onslaught are less important than the music's overall cumulative wallop. Despite the frequent addition of Ray Castro's vintage keyboards and the occasional Technicolor flourish of acoustic guitar or theremin, the bulk of the album rests on the core trio of Jefferson Marshall, M.I.K.E. Lardas, and Charlie Saufley. These songs all put a hefty premium on sky-blasted guitar solos and distant, echo-laden vocals that can give the album the impression of having been recorded at the same type of wide-open, abandoned locations where Roger Corman and Herschell Gordon Lewis used to shoot biker movies. 
    </p>
<p>
    In such an environment, of course, the strength of each recurrent riff becomes vitally significant. Fortunately, the Assemble Head appear to have the necessary goods at ready supply, equipping the melodic ""Mosquito Lantern"" with a clever inversion of Floyd's ""Lucifer Sam"" riff, and plotting out the prog-inclined ""Occult Roots"" with a procession of dark, swirling arpeggios. Occasionally, as on the title track or the ferocious ""D Brown"", the group do put their cavernous solos before their songcraft, leaving the listener with the afterimage of a vague, generalized din rather than a specific chorus or melody. 
    </p>
<p>
    More impressive, however, are such predominantly instrumental tracks as the majestic ""A Bourbon For Rudy"" or the acoustic-based ""The Morning Maiden"" (which has been listed elsewhere as ""The Chocolate Maiden""). On these tracks the Assemble Head take a considerably more thoughtful approach to song structure, raising their roofbeams gradually before giving way to their more florid, hippified outbursts. From the vantage of these peaks it is easy to imagine the Assemble Head eventually moving their sound outward into a more progressive direction, one where they are perhaps a little less inclined to settle for their affectionate browsing through the stoner rock archives.

    Ron Lewis, aka Ghost Stories, is a folk-rock hybrid content to try every pleasure-seeking trick in the indie reference book.  And it comes as no surprise to learn that the former member of the Fruit Bats and the Joggers' RIYL trip through 1990s indie rock was partially conceived seven years ago, making for several nostalgic, easygoing pieces content to sit on an era gone by.  Lewis perfected the older tunes, wrote a few 00s trend-teasers, and recorded it all in the comfort of his home.  Keeping acoustics at the helm, he uses feather-light production techniques and barely there vocals that will likely swaddle half his listeners in comatose joy and bore the rest.  <br/></p><p>
    The airy falsetto and soft harmonies that Lewis curls around blogger favorite ""The Upper Ten/The Lower Five"" would fit in with the easy melodic beauty of Aimee Mann's vaguely mystical rockouts on <em>Bachelor No. 2</em>. This song's melodically predictable and limply performed intro is a prelude to a dithering, withering structure of lilting verse vs. messy chorus that lacks innovation and punch-- even for all its ambitious rhythmic alterations.  There's something to be said for an imagination that can pull the acoustic guitar out of its apparent rut, but in the end it's the more modern sonic nods-- synths and other voracious electronics-- that will slightly exalt this album out of indie limbo.<br/></p><p>
    ""You Wear It Like a Stained Glass Window"" rips electric guitars through
    a noisy, melody-free intro, creating a better contrast than the
    previous track with a grating, static-drenched chorus and fumbling,
    quiet, and unplugged verses. Those dichotomous halves stay together
    because they're equally crushing, full of popular modern indie motifs such as cute keyboards, nonsensically cute vocals, obedient
    bass, and the occasional violence from the electric guitar. And it's often the
    instrumentation that impresses on this debut. The slow, rolling guitar
    strums that open ""The Motions"" and its heartbeat rhythm of drum and
    bass move the song beyond its simplistic, mostly word-free vocal
    smatterings. As the ditties get prettier-- bird-chirping ""Secret Life
    of the Union, Part I"" stands out-- the Elliott Smith vocal blandishes
    can be forgiven, even enjoyed (at the very least, ignored). But often the influences are too blatant and the songs too
    underdeveloped. <em>De rigueur</em>
    pop ballad ""Secret Life I"" is a strange departure, but a coloring
    that the album needs to just outweigh the derivative with the
    explorative.<br/>

    After centuries of music consumption, we're still obsessed with the crescendo. From all that classical music we learned in school to modern soundtrack fodder to the banal quiet/loud/quiet dynamics of groups like Explosions in the Sky, people still seek the thrill that comes when music reaches its stirring Big Moment. Blame remote controls or the death of vinyl, but 30-odd years after Brian Eno invented ambient music, most people are wary about ""turning off"" to any music that doesn't actively seek to engage them. Deep listening remains mostly theoretical in the age of mp3s.</p><p>
    Minimal techno isn't exactly built for the iPod age, so what's a post-disco producer to do when he wants the restraint but also the explosion? If most 21st century pop music could be whittled down to a ringtone without losing any of its effect, a dance producer who actually manages to hook the ear for six or seven minutes after that opening jolt-- while still rejecting, you know, narrative or harmonic development-- is doing something special.</p><p>
    Axel Willner, founder and sole member of the Field, is hardly the first to split the difference, but his formally simple yet functionally overwhelming music captures not only those big ecstatic peaks but also the initial ringtone-esque bursts like the two sides of the same coin they are, and basically just repeats them until he decides to stop tape. Willner's records under his Field alias (his other guises include Cordouan, Lars Blek, and Porte) do away with the build-up almost entirely while still milking the climax like a chemist running real-time tests to see just how long he's got until the drug's effect wears off.
    </p>
<p>
    That kind of pared-down sound-sculpting is everywhere in continental European electronic music these days, but rarely is it as instantly enveloping or as comforting as the Field's debut, <em>From Here We Go Sublime</em>. The album recalls Kaito, another artist on the German label with one great idea, likewise pushing wistfulness and simplicity to the brink. Favoring a dreamy minimalism of just a few sounds waltzing around each other, Willner smears, chops, and processes slivers of musical information-- the tips of a vocal, a note and a half of an instrumental-- in a delicate computer-assisted retrieval process. But unlike other maestros of hiccup and twang, Willner favors uncomplicated, revolving compositions rather than a loom-like mesh. It's a bare bones compositional gambit that could wind up utterly irritating, but with the ears of a hip-hop cratedigger and the hands of a surgeon is bliss. Gliding like zero-gravity skaters, opener ""Over the Ice"" spins, twirls, and pivots on just a shivering vocalized ""e""-- split across two octaves-- and an undulating ""i.""
    </p>
<p>
    But if <em>Sublime</em> initially sounds set for the dancefloor and not the couch, it's strictly down to Willner favoring quick tempos and rhythms, like the concussive ""uh!"" and the bumping acid bassline on ""The Little Heart Beats So Fast"". Despite its nods to house and techno, <em>Sublime</em> is really an extension of the best ambient electronics of the last decade or so, especially Gas, a project of Wolfgang Voigt, who as co-owner of Kompakt Records is now releasing the Field's music. (Not for nothing did Willner's sublime ""Kappsta"" appear on Kompakt's <em>Pop Ambient 2007</em> even as it could easily fit here.) Folks may also call the Field trance, because there's an often anthemic bigness to Willner's little sounds, a certain shameless bombastic quality to the way he deploys his loops and builds his arpeggios. And like both bog-standard dancefloor trance and ethereal Gas records such as <em>Pop</em>, Field tracks sound loud, even when played soft.
    </p>
<p>
    People may also call it trance because of Willner's elementary drum tracks, often just a deflated machine thump flecked with hi-hat hiss. Compared to peers like Perlon, Kompakt may not be particularly known for its adventurous drum programming but Willner's purposefully entry-level beats shift much of the percussive burden onto his melodies. And while Willner may be building his arpeggios out of baby love sighs snatched from the mouths of the Temptations (on ""Things Keep Falling Down"", sadly not included here) or strummed guitar loops nicked from nuggets of yacht rock instead of preset synth pads or Ableton plug-ins, his spirit animals are the likes of Sasha, Digweed, and Tiesto, guiding him on how to put his sounds together for maximum spine-tingly impact. There's a reason those guys sold so many records to a whole generation of folks looking for, well, the sublime. And like all those 2xCD 1990s trance mixes, an hour of Willner's vibrations may have you drooling for an off-beat or a key change or, hell, a build-up to crescendo.
    </p>
<p>
    But forget pop musical concerns for a second-- Willner's triumph on <em>Sublime</em> remains how he manages to isolate and repeat his little moments, transmuting them through the basic dance music building blocks of juxtaposition and repetition into something bigger, wringing pleasure out of the always potentially dull aforementioned ""sound sculpting"": The metallic schlurp of the drums and background hum of robot cicadas on ""Mobilia""; the fingertip flutters of the textural stuttering all over <em>Sublime</em>; the hot and heavy pressurized soaking of ""Sun and Ice""; the disembodied zombie doowop filched from the Flamingos' ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" that echoes through the title track like Kraftwerk daydreaming they're a soul duo, before the voices finally unspool into a timestretched blur as the record fades out-- one of the most shiver-inducing moments you'll hear all year. Often the best part of Willner's tracks are those final few seconds, as on ""A Paw in My Face"", the guitar sample finally escapes its loop with a joyous twang of freedom (only to reveal its source as Lionel Richie's bloodless lite-FM staple ""Hello""). If Willner doesn't hit at least some of your pleasure centers, well, forget your ears-- your nerve endings might actually be dead. Even three months in, it's a safe bet that <em>From Here We Go Sublime</em> will wind up 2007's most luxuriant record.

This is basically also what Brett Anderson tells me with the release of his first solo record. Granted, in the pantheon of Britpop-era sex gods (<em>there's</em> a scary visual), Anderson seemed the most impotent of the bunch; witness his now-famous quip about being a bisexual who'd never had a homosexual experience. Nonetheless, there was a time where Anderson's sexuality was his main currency, and it was powerful enough-- even in its messiness-- to provide the charge for two, maybe even three, great albums.</p><p>
    That ember's charcoal now, and has been for a while. Suede ended its run about three years too late, in 2002, with an absolute cannonball of a record. Optimistically titled <em>A New Morning</em>, it was the sound of them morphing into their own, second-rate cover band. In addition to providing just enough warmed-over guitar shapes and dutifully regurgitated SuedeWords™ with which to fill their own grave, it also cast further doubts on Anderson's waning vocal ability. Some speculated that he needed time out of Suede to get back to form; others held out for a far more unlikely scenario-- a reunion with his estranged creative partner, guitarist (and half-Gelfling) Bernard Butler.</p><p>
    Flash forward five years later, and both have come to pass. Unfortunately, the Anderson of old appears to have been definitively replaced by the Anderson of Old, the one whose creakier voice we forgive as the least of his crimes. Issued on the heels of Anderson and Butler's underwhelming reunion album as the Tears, this eponymous record marks the singer's first solo release, and demonstrates handily why its taken him this long to do something on his own. </p><p>
    Like the Tears record, this is being couched as an off-the-cuff release, less a definitive statement than a modest collection of songs. That low-stakes strategy is savvy, because on his lonesome Anderson is oppressively unimaginative. From his songwriting (verse-chorus-autopilot) to his sounds (a couple of which-- I'm looking at you, ""Scorpio Rising"" and ""Colour of the Night""-- are demo song cheesy) to his lyrics (phoned in as ever), Anderson remains completely eluded by the alien vision that mark his own favorite records. What's worse is that the sexual vigor that used to spark those early Suede songs has been swapped out with straight lethargy; the playful guitar wriggles and flailing energy a thing of the distant past. These days, Anderson is more likely to sing haughtily and preciously about his deceased father, or about the evils of consumerism, or indeed, about nothing much at all.</p><p>
    Aside from a lot of filler and a few genuinely horrendous/hilarious missteps (the aforementioned anti-capitalist morality play ""The More We Possess the Less We Own Ourselves"" makes Anne Geddes look like a master of nuance), a few things here are worth sampling. Despite a characteristically silly lyric, ""The Infinite Kiss"" does a reasonable job recalling the epic, lovelorn thing that used to be Suede's stock in trade; ""One Lazy Morning"" is a sweet enough Sunday-morning ballad; and opening track and lead single ""Love Is Dead"" constitutes a nice little comeback moment. ""Nothing ever flows in my life,"" sighs Anderson, ""Love is dead."" Sadly, it's the only metaphor here that works-- who knows if it was even intentional?</p></div>"|10039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10039-brett-anderson/|2.9|Mark Pytlik

    Since forming Axolotl in 2004, Karl Bauer has continually proven he can do anything with a drone. On nearly 20 records made mostly alone, he has explored texture, ambience, aggression, and rhythm, without ever sounding generic or indistinct. <em>Memory Theatre</em> compiles three of his hardest-to-find releases-- 2006's ""Chemical Theatre"" 12-inch and 2005's <em>Oranur </em>and <em>Object Phantom</em> CD-Rs-- which sound even better together than they did apart.</p><p>
    That's because the more you listen to Axolotl, the more recurring ideas and patterns you discover. Bauer's approach is simple: thick drones made with violin, electronics, and voice, sometimes accompanied by primitive percussion. The key to his hypnotic music isn't volume or density, but the way he mixes sounds and builds momentum. As with Fennesz or Tim Hecker, his pieces have a song-like logic, but they're more like paintings than tunes, with independent layers blended into picturesque wholes.</p><p>
<em>Memory Theatre</em> opens with ""Chemical Theatre"", an eight-minute stretch of oscillating tones that rub together like sheets of sandpaper. Rough and textured, it launches <em>Memory Theatre</em> into a stretch of heavy, tactile pieces. On ""Oranur"", groaning violins and a clacking beat (from William Sabiston, who provides percussion on five tracks) evoke Tony Conrad jamming with A Handful of Dust.  Bauer's violin remains a primal weapon; here it sounds like a jagged saw, but elsewhere it evokes a violent storm, a choral hymn, and even a howling voice.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Lake Garden"" follows with bells and chimes mixed into an insistent storm, and that urgent vibe crests on ""Kingdom of Ends"", whose tribal rumbling slowly melts into elongated moans. These first four tracks together feel like a spooky outdoor séance, with each sound doing double duty as music and atmosphere. 
    </p>
<p>
    Bauer shifts his tone with the middle track, ""Anomalon"".  As glitchy, bubbling sounds replace previous tension with calm, the album launches into outer space with no intention of returning. The whirring wind of ""Natura Naturans"" recalls the ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"" passage of Stanley Kubrick's <em>2001</em>, while ""Bions"" uses morse-code-like beeps to suggest what Stars of the Lid might sound like to a Martian picking up transmissions across the galaxy.
    </p>
<p>
    Clearly, it's easy to go overboard with the ideas and images that Bauer's work inspires, but that's a testament to his wide sonic range. <em>Memory Theatre</em> may not be Axolotl's best album (last year's <em>Way Blank</em> is a bit sharper), but as a representation of all the pictures Bauer can paint, it's hard to imagine a more complete portfolio.</p></div>"|10015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10015-memory-theatre/|7.9|Marc Masters

    Thanks to cultural parodies like <em>Crocodile Dundee</em> and Outback Steakhouse, Americans might be forgiven for having a rather one-sided view of Australians, one that's eerily similar to the rest of the world's opinion of us: They're loud, boorish, and crass; they have ridiculous accents; their slang sounds infantile at best and outright scatological at worst.</p><p>
    Before I get deluged with indecipherable hate mail from the other side of the world, note that these stereotypes are acknowledged as such, and since most Americans I know aren't morbidly obese warmongers who wear nothing but garish nylon wind-suits and kitschy embroidered sweaters, my intuition tells me that there must be many Australians who don't get drunk at noon and wallop each other with boomerangs for sport.</p><p>
    The Australian electronic composer Victor Bermon is proof positive. Judging from the jazzy strains of Bermon's Hefty Records debut, he seems like an agreeable fellow-- bookish and contemplative, with an interest in the sublime, if not the rapturous. <em>Arriving at Night</em> contains some of the easiest-listening electronic music this side of the Album Leaf. It proceeds by an inflexible logic where pleasing tones flow by with frictionless grace: nothing more, nothing less. 
    </p>
<p>
    In the vein of Prefuse 73 and Four Tet, Bermon straddles the divide between ambient electronic music and glitchy instrumental hip-hop. But unlike his more adventurous peers, he has exactly one mode: serene. A mood of tranquility dominates every track, including the ones that make room for the boom and the bap amid their prismatic digital minutiae, liquid arpeggios, and humming strings. 
    </p>
<p>
    The glassy shuffle ""Farewell Lunch for Laura"" has more contrast than anything else on the record: Liquid strokes of guitar, staticky gurgles, soft horns, flecked pianos, ballooning bass, and surges of insistent percussion comprise, for Bermon, an unusually varied sound range with three distinct phases of emphasis. But his progressions are so orderly, his shifts so crisp and telegraphed, that even the album's dynamic peaks (see also ""Famous Discussion"" and ""Theatre of Signs"") tend to recede comfortably into the middle distance. ""Photographs Are Not Memories"", which cycles between a canter and a trot as guitars tangle in a haze of beatific timbre, is velvety-smooth even when a gnarled tone starts scratching through the background for texture. 
    </p>
<p>
    While the comparable Album Leaf seems to often get by on pretty alone, Bermon's compositions are more heady and sly. One intuits in him a keen eye for natural patterns and symmetries-- concentric ripples on a pond; the delicate vein structures of leaves-- that he's simply unwilling to disrupt when translating them into sound. Even his glitches, like the staccato lunges of ""View of the Islands"", betray a love of order-- Bermon's glitches slot neatly into one another to produce somnolent, buttoned-down cadences, and the tones sliding away from the mix seem locked into invisible curves. From the shivering waves of ""We Face Each Other"" to the sun-struck slush of ""Unprepared"" to the chime-laden haze of ""Stacked Notebooks"", you always know just what to expect from Victor Bermon-- some permutation of clatter, hitch, shuffle and glide, drenched in gentle reverb and melodious samples, repeated ad infinitum. That <em>Arriving at Night</em> still merits repeated listening speaks to the care that went into crafting these tracks, which demand very little from listeners in return for their pleasure.

    Georgia
    cultivates a particularly introverted breed of indie singer-songwriter,
    especially if the artist in question is female and plays an acoustic guitar, if
    she whispers shyly and coyly into the mic, and if she writes self-deprecating
    lyrics that reveal her insecurities. Listening to Madeline's new mini-album <em>The Slow Bang</em>, which follows her 2003
    debut <em>Kissing and Dancing,</em> it's
    impossible not to hear Atlanta-born Chan Marshall or Rome's Liz Durrett, who both
    share her home state as well as her penchant 
    for hushed vocals and minimal arrangements. Madeline is more playful,
    certainly, and less shy than either, acting like she might actually enjoy the attention
    that performing and recording bring. So songs like the disarming opener
    ""Sleeping Dogs"", the nearly anthemic ""Good Houses"", and delicate closer ""Simple
    Words"" sound lively even when they're barely there and mordantly witty when
    they're most sincere. She probably even addresses the audience when she plays
    them live.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Madeline often treats precocity as an end in
    itself. Again and again on <em>The Slow Bang</em>,
    she falls for the showy line or the look-at-me phrasing. On ""Fish in the Sea"", which
    features a choir of Georgia crickets supporting one of her beguiling melodies, she
    actually sings, ""I've been huntin' and bitches be frontin'/when they limp like
    some wounded beast."" That the song is comforting a lovelorn friend only makes
    it sound more ironic and therefore more problematic. Her quirky poise falls
    away, and Madeline sounds like another sorority girl with a fruity-drink buzz
    flashing gang signs and peppering her slurred speech with <em>dawg</em>. That moment-- a gouge in the canvas-- nearly ruins the entire
    album.</p><p>
    However, it does show that Madeline is <em>in</em> the world, not apart from it. Rather than shutting herself in
    her bedroom to write and record-- which is the impression many of her peers,
    Georgian or not, give-- Madeline draws gregariously from her indie
    contemporaries, which gives her a surprisingly large musical vocabulary. <em>The Slow Bang</em> is, after all, released by
    Orange Twin, which is run by Elf Power, and features significant contributions
    from Matthew Houck of Athens-based Phosphorescent. ""Uncle's Sweetheart Pt. 2"" begins
    with Madeline playing acoustic and singing plaintively (i.e., no different than
    most other songs here), but then curveballs into a roots-rock, gospel-derived
    chorus that wouldn't be out of place on a Mary Chapin Carpenter song. That's no
    dig-- it's the largest, warmest moment on the album. On the other hand, that
    same worldliness motivates her to attempt a song like ""The Demise of Madame
    Butterfly"", whose clunky theatricality not only annoys listeners, but distances
    them from the artist. Madeline ought to let the Decemberists be the
    Decemberists. She has enough personality to make a whole album just by being
    herself.

    At first blush, this record is not
    nearly as captivating as Andrew Bird's previous three albums, but in his inimitable and subtle way, the Chicago singer-songwriter has here made yet another
    intricately detailed collection of songs. While <em>Weather Systems</em> and <em>The
    Mysterious Production of Eggs</em> found him discovering and exploring new
    territory, this is the album where he's built his house and now settles in and gets
    comfortable.</p><p>
    In a subgenre stuffed full with mediocrity, Bird has developed a singular style that frees him to add or subtract anything he likes from it-- no matter what he
    does at this point, chances are you're never going to mistake his music for anyone else's. On Bird's latest album, <em>Armchair Apocrypha</em>, guitar is far more prominent than it once was-- something Bird has been working toward in concert for a couple of years now. This addition deepens the texture created by his core instruments-- pedal-controlled loops
    of pizzicato violin, drums, and glockenspiel. With the addition of overdubs-- waves of
    multi-tracked violin, eerie whistling, and dizzying violin
    cadenzas-- and heavy layering, it all becomes nearly symphonic in scope.</p><p>
    The only thing that tosses and turns more than the music is
    Bird-- his lyrics are drawn from the kinds of thoughts that keep one up at night: ""Do you wonder where the self resides/ Is it in your head or
    between your sides?/ Who will be the one who decides/ Its true location?"" he
    sings on ""Darkmatter"", pondering the unknowable without resorting to
    pedestrian uses of the words ""soul"" and ""God.""  His wordplay is in top form and serves as a perfect foil for the tension and release of
    arrangements like that on ""Armchairs"", where a piano pushes around chunks of listless
    violin.
    </p>
<p>
    Oddly, Bird revisits a song from 2003's <em>Weather Systems</em>, his first album without former band the Bowl of Fire: ""Imitosis"" is built around a much faster version of the
    violin parts and vocal hook of <em>Weather Systems'</em> ""I"", but apart from those ingredients it's completely different-- and much better. The song takes a spiraling dive into Bird's interest in science and psychology and his distrust of the ways in
    which we use them in our world, spinning into an examination of the nature vs. nurture debate.
    </p>
<p>
    These trips through a conflicted superego may not work quite
    as well without Bird's sonic stamp, or his voice. His singing can leap from a
    low deadpan to a flying falsetto in a heartbeat, and he varies his verses and
    choruses to throw you slightly off balance before serving his precisely
    delivered hooks. Bird never takes a melody where you
    expect it to go, as on the chorus of ""Plasticities"", which is practically power pop with its snappy
    guitar hook and massive vocal melody, but the way it's recorded and arranged it
    gets under your skin more than it gets
    into your head.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Scythian Empires"" is one of the most subtle and elegant songs
    about the futility of battle and conquest written during the current Iraq War, linking brief mentions of Halliburton attaché
    cases and talk of ""exiting empires"" to an ancient, extinct civilization.
    The Scythians controlled vast swaths of modern-day Russia, Ukraine, and
    Kazakhstan for around eight centuries but now are all
    but forgotten-- Bird's indirect connection of them to the imagery of the last
    four years shows the sweep of history that speedily ushers most of our
    endeavors to the dustbin, and he does it without beating us over the
    head. 
    </p>
<p>
    If there's a disappointing moment on the record, it's when
    ""Heretics"" pulls back from the drama of its swirling intro and slips into a
    mixture of spoken and sung lines instead of just going hell-for-leather to a
    big chorus. Otherwise, the biggest criticism you could level at it is that it's
    not better than the three albums that came before it-- but that scarcely matters
    when you're actually listening to it, because <em>Armchair
    Apocrypha</em> is ultimately another object of strange and unique beauty from this inventive
    songwriter and performer.

My real name is Rain: a man with no fear, a man who do everything he desire without any law.""</em></p><p>
    So reads the introduction to <em>The Upsetter Selection</em>. So far, so Lee Perry, then... All the same, it's just as well to admit that we'd be lost without the cosmic-travelling, lunatic-savant schtick. By now most of the stories surrounding this man-- burning his own Black Ark Studios to the ground, talking to palm trees, walking backwards through Kingston hitting the ground with a hammer, claiming to run the International Monetary Fund-- are as well loved as they are known. They're part of his appeal, as key to his legendary status as the music he makes.</p><p>
    Keep an eye out for smoke and mirrors, though. View it from another angle and you can see that he's playing to the crowd-- fucking with us because we like it-- and you may even notice that that a kernel of truth lies nested at the heart of many of his eccentrically expressed statements, too. If nothing else, Perry's right about his bravery and disregard for convention; he's spent the past four decades almost single-handedly writing, rewriting, and occasionally shredding reggae's rulebook. Be it his collaborations with Clement ""Coxsone"" Dodd at Studio One, his stint with Joe Gibbs, his chart-topping songs with the Upsetters, his work with vocal artists including Bob Marley, U-Roy, and Junior Byles, or the alternate realities conjured by his dubs, it's safe to say that even the most casual music fan will have encountered his work at some point in their lives.
    </p><p>
    Claiming an irrefutable place among Jamaica's foremost musical innovators, Perry has already been the subject of countless anthologies, box sets, primers, and cash-ins. Here, however, as part of Trojan Records' ongoing series of celebrity curated anniversary compilations, he gets to select himself. It's a riveting 2xCD journey, documenting most every stage of the producer's career. Especially notable are initial experiments such as dropping jagged squalls of baby screams into ""People Funny Boy"" and reversing the vocal of Burt Walters' ""Honey Love"", then releasing it as a whole new Upsetters' record, entitled ""Evol Yenoh"". Straightforward, a bit bonkers, and crying out to be done, these tricks went on to become trademarks that are now immediately recognized around the world-- the things that made his name.
    </p>
<p>
    But why stay rooted on the earthly plane? Fast forward and you'll find Perry crediting himself as the man who helped Bob Marley vanquish the dark spirits that were at the time preventing his success. Listening to the languid defiance in the singer's voice on 1970's ""Duppy Conqueror"", it's an easy claim to believe. Regardless of the metaphysical or supernatural, Perry's relationship with the Wailers continued for many years, the collaboration's finest few minutes represented by ""Small Axe"", a song Marley never bettered.
    </p>
<p>
    Disc Two, meanwhile, ups the interest right from the start, kicking off with a triptych of ""skank"" tunes-- Charlie Ace &amp; Lee Perry's ""Cow Thief Skank"" and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry &amp; the Upsetters' ""Bathroom Skank"" and ""Kentucky Skank"". Almost confrontationally experimental for their time, these cuts remain mind-blowing. Packed with torrential collages of effects, they're perfect examples of the studio-as-instrument approach to production. Perry wrenches everything he can out of the mixing desk, then throws yet more at it, creating cavernous percussion rolls and splattering them with the greasy crackles of frying chicken or bursts of lascivious bump and grind. The result is disorienting, weird and extraordinarily seductive. Reach just far enough and ""Cow Thief""'s bricolage of several different songs, recorded in 1973, can even be seen as a precursor to electronic music's sampling and hip-hop's re-contextualization of the breakbeat. Still, all highfalutin ideas fly out of the window when you learn that the record's sole point was to take the piss out of fellow sound man Niney the Observer's shoes.
    </p>
<p>
    While capable of extreme oddness (both personal and sonic), Perry has always had a natural gift for working with singers. His skill is unmistakable on Jah Lion's ""The Lama (aka The Spiritual Whip)"", Prince Jazzbo's ""Penny Reel"", and Max Romeo's ""Fire Fe the Vatican"", but nowhere is it better displayed than on Susan Cadogan's ""Hurt So Good"", still one of the sexiest pieces of music ever committed to wax. Moving on through 1983's ""I Am a Madman"" to the title track of 2003's Grammy-winning reggae album <em>Jamaican E.T.</em>, it becomes evident that we'll probably never know the real Lee Perry, how sane he is, whether he really believes the things he says. It's not important, either, because, as great a creation as his persona may be, his music is infinitely better.

So call this oversight correction, because I fucking love TNV. <em>Dig Yourself</em> was, famously, the first new release on Siltbreeze in a bazillion years, after Lax had mothballed the label that had brought us such head-rearranging 90s noise-rock totems as the Dead C's <em>Harsh 70s Reality</em>, Harry Pussy's <em>Ride a Dove</em>, and dozens more. Times New Viking, three pain teens from Ohio punning on fonts, are another remaindered irregular tweed suit off the label's rack.</p><p>
    If the group's thrashing pop flair and shouty boy-girl vocal tradeoffs initially feel a little, well, hooky to stand alongside such cap-peeling titans as Mssrs. Russell, Morley, and Yeats, do not forget that Siltbreeze also released singles by the likes of Guided By Voices and was deeply steeped in the scratchy kiwi pop aesthetic. And the opening drums on ""Imagine Dead John Lennon"" (now <em>that's</em> a song title)-- the lead track from <em>Present the Paisley Reich</em>, TNV's second album-- sound like hammered aluminum, and the rest of the song, all 1:36 of it, seems as if it was recorded with one tin can in Ohio, the other tin can in Dunedin, and the twine dredged across the silty bottom of the Pacific. I wouldn't blink if you told me that the pressing plant actually used dryer lint or dead leaves to conserve petroleum; the album's sparkling multi-hued murk and wet paper flatness will have you cranking the volume in iTunes.</p><p>
<em>Paisley Reich</em> recalls everything from the Swell Maps' bedroom odes to Gerry Anderson to Huggy Bear's claustrophobically recorded teenpocalypse rave-ups, and from the snotrocket twee of the Vaselines to the musky, druid's glen fog that hung over the production of the Fall's <em>Slates</em>. And the songs are pop-punk gnashing and snarling and droning with all the sexual frustration-- ""Teenagelust!"" goes one title, and note the exclamation point-- and delicious ennui that's been surgically removed from the radio version. Times New Viking write the kind of terse, bitingly smart lyrics too smart to be buried in 10 million pounds of sludge from New York and New Jersey, but hopefully you'll just listen harder.</p><p>
    So they caterwaul, ""I don't want to die in the city alone"" and reject a lonely death with frantic cymbals and keyboards like needles in a camel's eye. 30 seconds before the end of ""Ladders"" the whole song shifts, jump-cuts, or changes channels, from distant noise to, like, louder noise. They bring out a <em>Nuggets</em>/""96 Tears"" organ that they play like a cloddish Terry Riley on ""Hiding in Machines"". And forget this era of emo concept double albums and epic <em>Neon Bible</em>-style chest-beating; <em>Paisley Reich</em> is finished and done in 28 minutes.

    In the middle of <em>Goliath, I'm On Your Side </em>comes a moment that colors
    the entire record-- except it's not so much one moment as a handful of them
    that stretch over 18 minutes. ""Hummingbird/Indian Dog"" consists of
    soft guitar, loops, and drones that shimmer and rise to the sky, a
    mostly-wordless dreamspace made of the gentlest psychedelia.</p><p>
    Once you hear it, it stays with you every time you play the record-- in the
    sturdier alt-country of ""The Devil Knows My Handle"", or the fragile
    ballads like ""Suddenly, It's You &amp; Me"" where every instrument and
    every timbre in Syd Alexis' voice reveal cracks. This is one of <em>those </em>indie
    albums, a late-at-night, ostensibly vulnerable singer-songwriter thing where
    the auteur's friends step in to flesh out those simple arrangements with all
    the right touches-- a Mellotron here, pedal steel there. The rhythm section of
    Kimberlee Torres and Gregg Porter, Nathan Groth on guitar and vibes, and guests
    like Say Zuzu's Jon Nolan provide a fragile backdrop-- like the melody of
    ""Silver Waves Crash Through the Canyons"" that takes off on
    paper-maché wings, or opener ""Sad, Sad Army"", where Alexis' vocals
    open in a night-shift croak.
    But
    this isn't an album that coasts on its vibe. The dreaminess sometimes takes its
    toll: for some this will be a soft listen, maybe softer than the songs call
    for. The mellifluous synths of ""I Will Arrange For You To Fall II""
    cradle you maternally, and a lullaby tone creeps in repeatedly. But the sublime
    state they achieve makes up for it. Two shorter instrumentals-- the brief
    ""Thicket"" and ""Oh, The Loneliness""-- feed the ambiance of
    ""Hummingbird/Indian Dog"", and together they give Alexis and gang a
    chance to set on tape the space rock field trips of their live shows. The songs
    are strong on their own, but these excursions give Hotel Alexis a chance to
    disappear into a dream for a while, and find out where it leads.</p></div>"|10007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10007-goliath-im-on-your-side/|7.5|Chris Dahlen

    David Terry, piercing pop crooner and lead singer of Aqueduct, has
    transformed his sound on his third album, second for Barsuk. Leaving the
    peddling energy of the drum machine for dirtier synths and guitars, Terry
    retains the piano, capturing the brightest, most nostalgically 1990s elements
    of his earlier work. <em>Or Give Me Death</em> begins with ""Lying In the Bed
    I've Made"", a monumental and aching fanfare that wouldn't sound out of
    place on Menomena's impressive <em>Friend or Foe</em>. The dizzying elegance of
    the piano line as it jumps deftly around a minor scale is coaxed into a
    predictable atmosphere by Terry's voice, a powerful Grohl-aping whine. A change to major key for a thumping, radio-ready chorus only hammers this home, and this opener quickly becomes a drab premonition of the rest of the album.</p><p>
    ""Living A Lie"" is a strong second track, again hinging its power on a
    darting, synthesized melody and, as a counterpoint, a surprising wash of
    guitars. But this transitory piece drifts into emo territory for the chorus, where guitars and vocals spit out angry dissonances and static noise with little reserve. On previous releases, where Terry was working as a solo artist, the
    use of synthesizer and drum machine led to playful, half-cooked,
    half-rehearsed, and ultimately danceable cuts. Even his more serious tracks,
    like piano montage ""The Suggestion Box"" from 2005's <em>I Sold Gold</em>,
    succeeded in driving home the earnest feelings of their narrator without
    pushing it. But push it these new messages do, with more dramatic, yet simpler
    tales and a more fervent adherence to a pop piano aesthetic owned by the likes
    of Billy Joel. The lilting keyboard syncopation on ""Keep It Together""
    and wistful strings on ""Just the Way I Are"" borrow Joel's thick,
    happy chords and troubled romantic's vocal addresses, making these songs a joy
    only for being slightly refreshing facsimiles.</p><p>
    Aqueduct's most relaxed numbers are the strongest, where guitar, piano, and synth fuse in rare harmony. The
    doomsday upright bass and spacebound synth on the strongest track,
    ""Unavailable"", harness the newfound power of the band. In the slow
    jam ""Zero the Controls"" Terry has made a lo-fi and sexy jam
    reminiscent of 2003's <em>Power Ballads</em>, as he combines digitized
    percussion, a twittering flute sample, thick drums, backup saxophones, and a
    lazy, bitcrushed vocal melody. In the
    adagio range Terry creates the best work on the album. He's still
    serenading a love subject, but losing some the man-and-piano clichés
    with points and counterpoints that are colorful and melodically
    surprising. Here, in a handful of instances, he blends the strengths
    of his favorite instruments instead of holding simplistic competitions
    between them.

    Inside the booklet included with Panda Bear's third solo album, <em>Person Pitch, </em>is
    a list of artists. The first four named are microhouse artists Basic Channel, Luomo, Dettinger,
    and Wolfgang Voigt. Maybe Noah Lennox, the man behind the Panda Bear, began
    this influence-naming exercise in a minimal techno state of mind. On the other hand, the inclusion of these four at the top could be
    significant. We always knew that the guys from his main band, Animal
    Collective, had an ear out for electronic music, but with Panda Bear, the
    impact of the DJ seems to run deeper. The music on <em>Person Pitch</em> sounds<em>
</em>nothing like proper dance music, but the basic structure-- the use of
    dynamics, and above all, the sense of repetition-- draws heavily from that context. Which is particularly interesting considering what else is going on.</p><p>
    The Beach Boys always come up when talking about Panda Bear, and not just because he shares their fondness for certain melodic turns: When he allows the reverb to blanch his voice, Lennox can
    sound uncannily like Brian Wilson. This tunefulness
    gives <em>Person Pitch </em>an appeal that extends beyond just Animal Collective
    fans, but the way the songs are put together also gives them an unusual twist.
    Producers in Brian Wilson's era never worked like this, sampling old songs and
    instruments and spinning them in wheels of sound that seem like they
    could go forever. Most of this record consists of intricately constructed,
    heavily layered, and highly repetitive loops on top of which Lennox sings oddly
    familiar and touching melodies. But despite its grounding in guitar pop, <em>Person Pitch</em> isn't likely to be mistaken for the work of a band. It
    sounds like what it is: one guy alone in his bedroom trolling through music
    history, picking and choosing bits to make something deeply personal and all
    his own.</p><p>
    The repetition of the music here, though probably engendered by computer, has a strange analog quality. You can almost see the
    turntables rotating on the opening ""Comfy in Nautica"", which loops
    Lennox's sung ""ah""'s and handclaps to evoke ritual campfire music, while the deep reverb on his voice puts us in the same liturgical
    headspace found on his very different acoustic record <em>Young Prayer </em>from
    2004. ""Take Pills"" repeats a tambourine and twangy guitar during its slower opening section while industrial
    samples that sound like car parts being followed down an assembly line fill
    in the vast spaces. The field recordings take an aquatic turn on the track's
    second half, as Lennox picks up his acoustic guitar and moves the party
    to the beach, singing ""I don't want for us to take pills anymore"" to
    the kind of effortlessly melodic line that once expressed thoughts like ""da doo ron ron.""   
    </p>
<p>
    Given the presence of such tremendously catchy pop moments on <em>Person Pitch</em>,
    the record's indulgences feel completely earned. The flurry of tabla
    that opens the extended ""Good Girl/Carrots"" sticks out at first but
    makes sense once Lennox gets the hectic dub chaos out of his system and settles
    into the second section's hypnotic tune. When the song edges become wispy and
    shapeless on ""I'm Not"", which blends Lennox's voice with an
    indistinct droning synth, the mood and thrust of the album gives the
    track the appropriate context. ""Search for Delicious"", reminiscent of
    the glowing ambient drift of Lennox's side project Jane, won't leave the drone
    alone, repeatedly knocking Lennox's singing off track like a clumsy but
    well-meaning drunk. Music of such warped processing would be a specialist's
    item, but as a breather here, before the simple and childlike music-box closer
    ""Ponytail"", it feels right.
    </p>
<p>
    I still haven't talked about the 12-and-a-half-minute ""Bros"", the
    astonishing track that serves as the album's centerpiece. It's here that <em>Person
    Pitch</em>'s repetition and DJ's sense of timing are most apparent, while
    Lennox's songwriting hits a melodic peak. The first few bars turn to
    the golden age of 60s and 70s radio, with some rattling
    percussion chipped from Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and a chiming acoustic guitar that could be
    pulled from the Beach Boys' ""Girl Don't Tell Me"". But as the loops pass on
    ""Bros"", the song begins to seem like a glorious travelogue, a journey
    along a path where all the music's influences are visible along the roadside:
    the Wilson Brothers in their pinstripe shirts, or the queasy
    phasing and random sound effects-- a subway, people on a roller coaster, a baby
    crying-- of Lee ""Scratch"" Perry. When Panda
    begins to chant halfway through, we hear an echo of his main band, and when the neo-Latin piano comes in during the latter portion, transforming the track
    from internally-focused meditation to outwardly-beaming celebration, we get an
    image of Derrick May's classic techno anthem ""Strings of Life"" busting into a DJ set to
    make everyone go crazy. 
    </p>
<em>Person
    Pitch</em> as a whole-- and ""Bros"" in particular--<em> </em>evokes
    the sunshine of Lennox's adopted Lisbon, Portugal home. But it's the kind of
    light best experienced with eyes closed-- with the rays filtered through
    eyelids, turning the world into various shades of red and orange. You can feel
    the warmth pouring out of the music and see abstractions of its inspirations--
    that whole long list and more-- as they cycle around again and again and again.
    Five of these seven songs have been released in various forms on singles and
    12""s previously, so the exceptionally high quality of this music isn't a
    surprise to those who have been following Panda Bear closely. Still, hearing it
    all together in one place and listening to it all at one time is both
    overwhelming and inspirational.</div>"|10025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10025-person-pitch/|9.4|Mark Richardson

Even 40 years later, it's hard not to immediately crush out, especially staring into those kittenish saucer eyes. Does she want to cuddle you, crush you, or drink a pop? Weiss looks exactly how a mod, mid-60s girl-group frontchick, the leader of the charm school dropouts in the Shangri-La's, <em>should</em> look, an earth angel hiding cigarettes under princess beds and giving dad indigestion, stuffing all the roiling teenage sexual tension of the era into print dresses and pleated dress slacks.</p><p>
    A few weeks back, Weiss performed on ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" in what had to be her first television appearance in decades, long sidelined by music industry nonsense. Backed live on the air, as on the new <em>Dangerous Game</em>, by Greg Cartwright's Reigning Sound, Weiss' time in civilian life was evident. While her voice was mostly in fine shape, she unsurprisingly appeared a little hesitant; the band was likewise hesitant, perhaps to give their idol a wide berth. Yet compare Weiss' slight awkwardness to the brassy showbiz bullshit of Diana Ross' recent appearance on ""American Idol"". Don't call it ""ordinariness""; instead, call it ""realness.""</p><p>
    Realness is an odd word to invoke when discussing 60s girl groups, a very melodramatic world where everything was exaggerated for impact, and you especially shouldn't invoke it when Cartwright's writing for <em>Dangerous Game</em> pledges fidelity to the long-abandoned sound of the era. The music on <em>Dangerous Game</em> is gloriously authentic fakery, drawing more on Cartwright's deeply held classicism-- be it for blues, early rock 'n' roll, gospel, r&amp;b, girl groups-- than the punk snarl of Reigning Sound records like <em>Too Much Guitar</em>. With just an organ in place of the massed strings, ""Break It One More Time"" has a Spectorian grandeur; it doesn't quite match the wall of sound, but it comes as close as a bar band can.
    </p><p>
    So perhaps instead of realness, which really means nothing, Weiss is just being her old plain-spoken self. Cartwright's reproductions will thrill anyone with a slight interest in 60s rock; it's Weiss' unadorned and adult ruminations on love and loss, shoved through the pubescent syntax of the girl-groups, that give <em>Dangerous Game</em> its power. Even in the 60s, her bandmates sported bouffants like football helmets. Weiss wore her blonde hair down, the kind of sartorial choice that in pop music, where simple gestures mean just about everything, can communicate lofty stuff like a suspicion of artifice, a struggle with romanticism. The ""dangerous game"" we learn is love itself, of course, and from the first track, ""My Heart Is Beating"", Weiss is singing about someone who did her wrong, someone who cheated and lied. And yet she still wants them back, if they can just stick to the simple promise to straighten up and fly right. Even non-English speakers can probably surmise, just from Weiss' forlorn vocal, what exactly it was that got busted up on ""Break It One More Time"". The music may be time bound but the theme of <em>Dangerous Game</em> timeless: the struggle of a wounded heart that still wants to let its guard down enough to be loved. Its language isn't ""simple""-- even purposefully so, as you might think given how the music hearkens back to the simplicity of pre-<em>Sgt. Pepper's</em> rock; it's universal.
    </p>
<p>
    The only time the album shows its limitations is on ""Cry About the Radio"", a hokey, albeit mercifully short, lament for the music Weiss grew up with. ""Kids don't know shit,"" she sings, more like a cranky old man than the tough-but-guarded lady she's been up until now. ""They just want a hit/ I don't write hits."" Except she <em>did</em> write hits at one point, and so of course, ""you may wonder where the real songs have gone,"" the kind of fogeyism we shouldn't accept from anyone, no matter how much of a legend they are.
    </p>
<p>
    But still, from Cartwright's reverent licks to Weiss' surprisingly sturdy vocals, <em>Dangerous Game</em> is a small, self-contained triumph, an understated comeback that never tries to announce itself as an event. ""When I was a young girl/ You were my whole world,"" Weiss sings on the lovely ""Stitch in Time"", but she's not a young girl anymore, and the tension between her hard-earned knowingness and the sunny throwback simplicity of the music is what makes <em>Dangerous Game</em> great. Not making an album for decades may have been the best thing to happen to Weiss. There are no 80s comeback albums with gated Steve Lillywhite drums marring the discography; no trip-hop excursions in the mid-90s. She jumped straight from her classic material into a buoyant and yet mature second act. The Shangri-La's and other girl groups may have influenced legions of willfully infantile twee bands and hermetically sealed revivalists like the Pipettes, but here Weiss proves that the past shouldn't be a refuge. The power of those girl groups came from the steel reserve and starting sensitivity they had when facing the trials and tribulations of the present.

    Brooklyn's Palomar makes indie-pop sound like it wandered through a cloud of
    gamma radiation and wound up with superpowers: lurid muscles, torn jeans, the
    whole nine. Rachel Warren's singing is simple and tonally pure, with the same
    mix of velvety sweetness and skyscraping grandeur that makes boys swoon for
    Jenny Lewis and Tracyanne Campbell, and her lyrics tend toward the ambiguously
    lovelorn: There are songs about depleted relationships, like ""The Air
    Between Us""; songs about missed chances, like ""Bridge of Sighs"";
    and songs that don't seem to be about much of anything, like ""He Came to
    Stay"". Like Au Revoir Simone, the quartet knows how to ratchet up the
    euphoria of glossy harmonies with abrupt register shifts. Like Tilly and the
    Wall, they're fond of clattering, makeshift percussion: The cheery death wish
    ""Bury Me Closer"" features drummer Dale Miller banging on a bucket,
    for instance.</p><p>
    But <em>All Things, Forests</em> has one quality that distinguishes Palomar
    from their precious peers-- the urge to <em>rock the fuck out</em>. Twee-leaning
    indie-pop tends to find a natural sonic parallel in gauzy and jangling tones,
    which are not absent from this album. Opener ""Bury Me Closer"" is
    relatively staid, with its watery organs and efflorescing vocal harmonies,
    although its spring-wound percussion and rangy bass render it taut.
    ""Surprise Us"" gently massages a two-note guitar twinkle and an
    acoustic strum toward an emphatic yet dreamy climax that's uncommon, but not
    entirely foreign, to this sort of indie-pop. You get a sense that Palomar had
    to actively restrain these songs from exploding into hooky rockers, as they
    seem so fond of the technique elsewhere.</p><p>
    Most of the album displays a surprisingly delicate balance between
    adorability and raw power reminiscent of alt-rock revivalists Sybris. Palomar
    tempers their softer side with muscular percussion, hard-charging bass lines,
    and some of the starriest guitar pyrotechnics this side of Broken Social Scene.
    On ""Our Haunt"", a slinky minor-key guitar figure, ominous low-end,
    and squalls of feedback build tension for its sturdy main riff and chorus of
    crashing fuzz-chords, and Warren injects a dash of low-key gloom into her
    naturally sunny voice. This tension between the melodious and the strident
    recurs throughout the album: ""The Air Between Us"" goes out in a
    white-hot guitar blaze; ""Beats Beat Nothing"" slips limpid guitar
    tones into its churning rock drive; meandering rattlefest ""He Came to
    Stay"" squeals and transforms into an outsized stomper. Suddenly, the
    phrase ""twee as fuck"" sounds a little less ironic than it did before.

    Humor before wisdom, <em>s'il vous plait</em>. On the Zincs' 2005 album <em>Dimmer</em>,
    Chicago-via-Albion singer/songwriter Jim Elkington brought a bleak touch of
    funny to the folk-tinged indie rock he'd honed since his days in dour 90s UK
    bands Sophia and Elevate. Just a touch, though, which-- when it comes to love,
    anyway-- was all the music-factory workers of Clivilles &amp; Cole really needed. Hey, it was in <em>Sister Act</em>!.</p><p>
    The Zincs' third album, <em>Black Pompadour</em>, engenders more awkward
    chuckles than outright guffaws. The brooding mid-mid-tempo pacing and smoky
    classic-rock guitar grandeur set a table for some serious moping. Elkington's
    uneasy baritone conjures up the type of blokes who aren't exactly quick with,
    um, jokes: Jim ""Spanky"" Morrison, David ""the Knife"" Bowie,
    fellow sad Brit popster Richard ""Oates"" Hawley, ol'
    what's-his-haircut from Editors, etc. John McEntire's clear, detail-rich mix
    lets the moody bass lines, toms, and keyboards settle behind the, like, just
    good songs, duders.</p><p>
    Well, there's the typical rub, right? Chicago guitar guy Nathaniel
    Braddock's perambulating watch-this-riff riffs deserve better than phrases like
    ""self-mesmeric drones,"" but Elkington's lyrics don't stop at
    accidental self-criticisms. Somebody's got a case of staggering bombast:
    ""Would that I were as young as those musk-agers,"" he intones
    ponderously on ""Burdensome Son"". Gentleman tops himself on word-crazy
    ""Hamstrung and Juvenile"", groaning, ""Once those copulations
    fail/ You're only half that creature with two spines."" It's as if the
    terrorists behind the Bible's New International Version went to work ruining <em>Othello</em>.
    Those <em>fucksticks</em>! 
    </p>
<p>
    Horns smolder, handclaps bring temporary joy, sundry solos stab back and
    forth longer than you'd expect, but mostly Elkington keeps overreaching.
    ""They scheme with Caesarean smiles,"" he observes of ""The Mogul's
    Wives"". <em>She was like a bearded rainbow.</em> Elsewhere, he notices
    ""the wretchedness of the reptiles' rush."" <em>Eyes in their nipples.</em>
    Awkward chuckles don't really hit till boudoir duet ""Lost Solid
    Colours"", when Jimbo <em>suave</em>'s all, ""I'm so good-looking/ Gonna
    tell you what you're all about/ Just a thin towel/ Keeps moving your mess around.""
    <em>Here is the dome, back with the-- </em>wait, ""mess""?

<em>Fulton Lights</em> is a dark, intensely
    serious and brooding record, one seemingly composed alone in the back of a taxi
    as it coursed through Brooklyn side streets after a long, long night.
    Throughout, Andrew Spencer Goldman projects his frustrations-- from the
    perceived inadequacies of American capitalism and media industries to personal
    feelings of self-doubt over missed opportunities-- onto the expansive canvas of
    the cityscape, the record's inspiration and focus. The inner-cover album art
    explains nicely the tone of the record, along with its clearly-stated
    conceptual ambition: A silhouetted man walks alone on a streetlamp-lit urban
    street, the main swatch of color an American flag tacked to a chain link fence.</p><p>
    A multi-instrumentalist himself, Goldman recruited a broad cast of contributors
    for <em>Lights</em>; the liner notes list violin, viola, cello, trombone, upright
    bass, Rhodes organ, vibraphone, and turntables among the instrumentation. But
    the most fitting term in the credits is the most open-ended one: ""programming.""
    Though only listed on a few songs, this general descriptor seems to be the M.O.
    of <em>Lights</em> on the whole. The record apparently took over three years to
    complete, and every detail feels appropriately slaved over, from the placement
    of plaintive, echo-laden piano notes to the slowly rising and falling
    background guitar washes. For a collection of songs seemingly designed to be
    soulful and evocative, a vibe of careful calculation pervades the record, which
    never moves past the pace of a slow, pensive 3am stroll.</p><p>
    Goldman's lyrics and vocal delivery are, to a fault, the record's most
    carefully plotted component. On the unfortunately-titled opener ""Thank God
    for the Evening News"", he seems determined to leave nothing to the
    listener's imagination, relying on heavy-handed sarcastic sloganeering that,
    perhaps accidentally, echoes the city's plentiful angst-ridden coffee shop
    poetry. Over a dated trip-hop beat courtesy of Dälek's Oktopus, Goldman rails
    against the media machine: ""But you can't believe everything you hear/ And
    you can't believe everything you see/ Like White House press conferences/ About
    freedom and democracy"". He ends with ""And thank God for Wall
    Street,"" a fitting broadside to conclude a song that attempts to tackle so
    much. Goldman's high-register folky weep of a voice-- a slightly darker Sufjan
    Stevens-- reflects well the emotional tenor of ""Evening News"" and <em>Fulton
    Lights</em> on the whole: impassioned, sentimental balladry with no shortage of
    symbolism.
    </p>
<p>
    While Goldman's clunky polemicizing proves, to his credit, to be a false omen
    for the remainder of <em>Lights</em>, his passion holds true throughout and
    continually threatens to lapse into full-on schmaltz. Thematically, <em>Lights</em>
    progresses through a song cycle that begins with urban alienation and paranoia
    (""1,000 Little Eyes"", ""The Sound of the City""), the
    unceasing passage of time (lyrics include ""Time is the monkey on our
    backs"" and ""Here's to bad memories/ May they fade""), and finally
    to a quietly hopeful epilogue (""Breathe In, Breathe Out"") that finds
    comfort in metropolitan surroundings by adhering to the titular recommendation.
    It's only a slight respite, however, from the often overwhelming, stilted sense of
    despair and longing that pervades <em>Fulton Lights</em>. The record is
    an extended therapy session that succeeds mainly by creating an intense longing
    for the warm morning light.

Nadja somehow churns out ""doom metal"" for the post-rock and noise sets. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Touched</span><span> is as strident as it is meticulous, its Swans sense     of purpose and volume attached to an almost symphonic use of motion. Even when     things are still, there's an intense undercurrent just below the surface.     That's as true in classical music as it is in some of the best noise, and     on the explosive </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Touched</span><span>, Nadja     bridges its taste for both.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Take note of the opening, roaring up from a metal-flake     drone that recalls Tony Conrad's most serrated edges. That tumbles into a     lock-and-stomp dirge, rhythmic thunder collapsing onto everything it can find     for the first 12 minutes. With gravity at work, mammoth layers topple over one     another only to seek high ground later. The static that introduces     ""Incubation/Metamorphosis"" is equaled by Baker's multi-tracked vocals and later     swallowed completely by the feedback and saturated drums of closer ""Flowers of     Flesh"". But when the album ends, that static is one of the few sounds that     makes it out alive. It's tempting to call these 13- and 18-minute pieces smears,     but that's too impressionistic or obtuse. These are selective     stretches, and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Touched</span><span> is about arcs and waves: Nadja can be as heavy as the     best industrial or doom band you've ever heard. Then again, sometimes they     sound like they've taped a contact mic to some great abyss and let the tape     roll with the soft murmurs of souls. That liminal space is perfect and     magnetic. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Indeed, Central to <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Touched</span><span>'s success is Nadja's mastery of dynamics through suspense, release, and     relief: The first 43 minutes often roar and squall, but-- even at their     loudest-- there's the distinct feeling that the sound is peaking just below the     climax. The idea plays out in distended fade-aways and transitions: ""Stays     Demons"" marches along a high plateau, commanding drums and overdriven slabs of     bass overrunning Baker's effects-smothered vocals. But during ""Flowers of     Flesh"", Nadja finally lets things go. The drums are colossal and the     noise-- aggregated synthesizers, processors, and guitar tracks, stacked into a     perfect beast-- ruins the long-sustained build in the best sense. Things explode     onto more menacing planes, a remarkable climax borne of self-imposed     restraint. Baker's vocals are sinister now, like Xasthur's Malefic back inside     the </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Black One </span><span>coffin, attached to     a strange cocktail of morphine and caffeine concentrate. ""Flowers of Flesh"" is     meant to wreck you, and it probably will. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is release <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">and</span><span> relief, though. For everything that ""Flowers of Flesh"" razes, the short     untitled fifth track offers to rebuild. Quiet and consonant, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Touched</span><span> ultimately suggests the whole thing may have been a     nightmare. Or maybe this is just the eye of the storm. Either way, the path to solace     is full on both high drama and deliverance.</span></p></div>"|9997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9997-touched/|7.9|Grayson Currin

In fact, it's been nearly a decade since Everything But the Girl's 1999 <i>Temperamental</i>, after which the duo went on extended hiatus     and, perhaps more accurately, singer Thorn went on extended maternity leave.     Sure, there was an EBTG best-of, and Thorn (with her longtime partner Ben Watt)     curated a <i>Back to Mine</i> comp. But no one had heard a freshly recorded peep     from Thorn until she resurfaced singing with Tiefschwarz on their 2006     Fabric mix.     Still, that's nothing compared to the wait to hear from     Tracey Thorn, solo artist. No one's heard from Tracey Thorn, solo artist, since     her barely-there 1982 debut <i>A Distant Shore</i>, after which she teamed with Watt     to form Everything But the Girl and moved on to bigger, better, and altogether more fleshed-out things. But     with Watt off gallivanting around the globe as an in-demand DJ and the kids apparently okay to go, Thorn has finally returned to the studio for another stab at flying     solo.</p>
<p>Needless to say, much has changed since 1982, both in     Thorn's life as well as in Thorn's music, with the biggest difference between     then and now probably Everything But the Girl's unlikely flirtation and     ultimate intersection with house music. The merger transformed the group from     sophisti-pop cult act to clubland favorites, not only earning the duo its     biggest success to date but ensuring its perennial spot on countless dance     comps.</p>
<p>No surprise, then, that many of those dance elements have     returned along with Thorn on <i>Out of the Woods</i>. But this is no     club record; instead it nicely encapsulates Thorn's best quality-- the unlikely diva and     cosmo chanteuse, wrapped up in one-- while doing its darndest to prove as unchallenging as possible. It's a     disc better suited to a relaxing afternoon shopping for jeans than a sweaty     night out.</p>
<p>In a sense Thorn was fortunate that few outside the rabidly     faithful were clamoring for a comeback, as the greatest advantage of making an     album no one expected is that you're able to make an album free from     expectations. That's a benefit most veterans would kill for, and at least     initially Thorn takes advantage of the clean slate. The opener ""Here It Comes     Again"" is a gorgeously pastoral piece of chamber folk that does justice to     Thorn's evocative lyrics. ""The sun coming through the rain is more precious     than God,"" she sings, and if you close your eyes and sit still for a bit, that     image comes across perfectly clear through the mix of English countryside     melancholy and heavenly beauty.</p>
<p>Sticking to such a subdued internalized mood would have     taken some courage, especially for a comeback record, so maybe it's not as     surprising as it is a little disappointing that Thorn chooses to play it safe,     taking much of the rest of the record indoors for a series of mostly     standard-issue dance tracks that range from good to fine to perfunctory but     never quite achieve the tacit goal of most club music: euphoria.</p>
<p>The downtempo schoolyard taunt chronicle ""A-Z"" starts things     out on a strong note, the pointed lyrics of ""small town hell"" compensating for Ewan Pearson's 1980s-meets-90s production (it's like Bronski     Beat's ""Smalltown Boy"" at half speed). The actually pretty excellent ""It's All     True"" continues on the decidedly retro track, with self-consciously dated     squiggling synth squiggles and percussion flourishes as timeless as they are     anonymous. With ""Get Around to It"" the album gets a bit of second hand     inspiration from Arthur Russell, whose track gets remade as a funky disco     rave-up that features the Rapture's saxophonist Gabe Andruzzi squonking away.</p>
<p>But after that early (musical) peak, ""Hands Up to the     Ceiling"" brings it back down again, or at last back inward, and Thorn's     suddenly warm glimmer of heart and directly personal sentiment fulfills the     promise of ""Here It Comes Again"", the mellow trip down memory lane name     checking ""Siouxsie Sioux and Edwyn, too,"" while incorporating the requisite     references to rain coming down ""on a cold grey town."" It's like a UK indie ""In     My Room"" (Beach Boys or Weezer, take your pick).</p>
<p>""Easy"" marks the shift back to downtempo dance, all space     swooshes and low squelches, but it's hard to imagine this is the music the (we     assume) teenage Thorn of ""Hands Up to the Ceiling"" turns to when it's time to     escape. It's solidly constructed, but at the same time the song's almost oppressively     generic. The same could be said for ""Falling Off a Log"", whose spooky Omnichord     chimes are all that sets it apart from what could be a slick, safe, boutique     friendly remix. The throbbing ""Grand Canyon"" makes Thorn sound like a guest on     her own album.</p>
<p>Thus the pretty ""By Piccadilly Station I Sat Down and Wept""     again interrupts to underscore what the rest of the album has already evinced.     Here Thorn's at her best, and her barest, both musically and emotionally,     allowing her voice to take precedent over the beats rather than serve as a mere     supporting player. Were the rest of the album this consistently mellow, the     concluding ""Raise the Roof"" might have had a greater effect, a glimmer of     optimism that washes away the gloom. Instead it's just another upswing of the     album's back-and-forth cover the bases pace.</p>
<p>The difference is that on this final track, you can     practically hear Thorn smiling as she allows herself to cautiously warm up,     leaving behind the restrictions of chill out music for something a little more     fun and loose. In context it sounds like nothing so much as the kind of     soundtrack fodder that plays as the credits roll. A chick flick, no less, after     the personal touches of the screenplay have been market tested and twisted     through numerous permutations until what's left is perfectly serviceable and     never less than pleasant, but still suspiciously closer to product than what     the writer might have originally intended. At this point in her career, Thorn     shouldn't be courting the middle, and considering the best moments on <i>Out of the     Woods</i>, she didn't have to, either.</p></div>"|10012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10012-out-of-the-woods/|5.6|Joshua Klein

    Ted Leo, one of rock's last great intellectual populists,  likes to throw you. Now on his fifth album, <em>Living With the Living</em>, the thirtysomething rocker still prefers the same music he's probably loved since his teens: the smarty-pants punk and new wave of turn-of-the-1970s UK labels like Stiff; the amped-up rhythm'n'soul of 60s mod and ska; the rangy heavy rock of Thin Lizzy; the hard-strumming folksiness of 80s indie; and the idealism impressed on him by American hardcore. The Pharmacists' oeuvre is all of a two-toned piece, but each record stands on its own, just different enough from its predecessor. So while I haven't lived with <em>Living</em> for very long, it's steadily grown on me, making me want to rave louder about it than it may deserve.</p><p>
    Call me a booster rather than a critic, but I love Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and seriously want this band be, like, fucking huge. But at the same time, and call me old-fashioned, it's honorable the way Leo has opted to grow his audience and his songwriting talent organically-- and watch both increase exponentially, on his own terms. I like that he's got ethics and ideals that go beyond lifestyle choices. I like that he sees writing the most compassionate song possible about eating disorders as a political act, because it is. And with its airtight rhythm section and the crackling energy of its bug-eyed frontman in his Conflict
    T-shirt, no rock band currently touring
    puts on a better live show than the Pharmacists.</p><p>
    On stage is where the looser songs of <em>Living With the Living</em> will ultimately live or die. More expansive-- for better or worse-- and prettier than anything Leo's done yet, the record is most closely related to 2001's <em>The Tyranny</em> <em>of Distance</em>, which was the sound of R.E.M.-style jangle stretched tight until it turned to punk. Like most punk lifers, Leo's music expresses a big-hearted emotional openness, but sonically, punk has also made him a solid editor, suspicious of bullshit ornamentation.
    </p>
<p>
    ""The Sons of Cain"" is one of the better examples of his skill here: Its driving cowpunk finds flashes of Chuck Berry in Leo's licks, handclaps, and a sharp piano run tucked neatly in the mix, plus some ecstatic, throat-shredding whooping at the climax. As usual, Leo knows how to start strong, too, opening <em>Living</em> with three sure shots in a row-- especially ""Army Bound"", with its wicked solo. Leo's always had a bit of guitar hero in him, usually confining it to the one- or two-note rave-ups that smart punk bands hold to the fade-out. But where he once shaved his songs to their communicative essentials, here he's getting loose, mostly because when bands get suppler, more responsive, and more technically accomplished they're apparently entitled to stretch out. Like, you know, the Clash.
    </p>
<p>
    It's an old rock band move that fails as much as it succeeds. For example, after four minutes of actual song, the outro to ""The Lost Brigade"" is three-and-a-half minutes of one note-- and not a particularly engaging note, either. You can skip the reggae trifle ""The Unwanted Things"", a momentum-killer on an album with an already wobbly sense of pacing. You can also pass over the awful political jeremiad ""Bomb. Repeat. Bomb."", which my Leo-loving drinking buddy disparagingly described as Blink 182 trying to be Crass (though I wouldn't be that rude to either Crass or Blink 182). Strangely, for such a sharp political eye and such an obvious humanist as Leo, the lyrics seem to be attacking the young bomber pilots, not the political quagmire that put those bombers in the air. And though Leo's fingerpicking is lovely and the melody's memorable, the tin whistle break in ""A Bottle of Buckie"" verges on Celtic kitsch.
    </p>
<p>
    When playing to his strengths, though, Leo's songwriting is as strong as ever. Joe Strummer would appreciate the riffs on ""Who Do You Love?"", which climaxes in a stirring outro straight out of ""Safe European Home"" and indulges Leo's own mannerisms to great effect. (See also the short, sharp ""The World Stops Turning"".) ""The Toro and the Toreador"" should have been the album's closer; it's the climatic, rousing yelp of <em>Tyranny</em>'s ""You Could Die (Or This Might End)"" with years of experience behind it, stretched out into a six-minute slow burn that milks the peaks of big melodramatic ballads for all they're worth. And ""La Costa Brava"" may be the best thing the Pharmacists have recorded yet, Leo's version of an epic, radio-ready, quiet/loud/quiet modern rock song.
    </p>
<p>
    So despite a pretty high hit/miss ratio, as a big-step-forward record, <em>Living</em> ain't exactly <em>Armed Forces</em>. Maybe that's because, instead of being in thrall to fastidious (for which you can read ""British"") writers of single-length punk songs, <em>Living</em> often sounds like Leo's most <em>American</em> record to date, its unabashed big-ness more like Jersey boy Leo is still living under the towering shadow of the dude who made <em>Born to Run</em>. And like Bruce, to whom he's frequently been compared and whom he's covered live, even when Leo's attempts at big statements and big songs flop on <em>Living</em>, that same big-hearted openness makes you want to, rightly or wrongly, forgive his excesses. Even at his most impassioned and over the top, you never catch glimpses of Leo molting at some point into Bono. But I continue to slot Leo in the ""hero"" column, and despite <em>Living</em>'s indulgences and occasionally soggy bottom half, I also continue to wish him well in his quest to win the world over, one kid at a time.

While many major label giants produce albums forged over several back-breaking months, a lot of indie's greatest opuses, from <em>Slanted and Enchanted</em> to <em>The Moon and Antarctica</em>, sound like the one-off recordings of a band that just happened to stumble into a studio. Mother Mother's debut is by no means such a watershed effort, but <em>Touch Up</em> comes packed with acute, snappy pop songs with no discernible signs of the elbow grease it took to craft them. However, the Vancouver five-piece lives and dies by their lax nature, which, while intriguing initially, lacks consistency over an entire album.</p><p>
    The band's quirky songwriting, combined with its affinity for acoustic-only arrangements, sounds like a throwback to goofy staples such as the Violent Femmes or the Meat Puppets. The vocal carousel of Debra-Jean Creelman and Ryan and Jean Guldemond keeps the punk-folk nuanced enough to avoid mere imitation, bending their acoustic pop from the Breeders to Devendra Banhart. Opener ""Dirty Town"" showcases the vocal triumvirate's singing and charisma at full force as they take turns fantasizing about buying a farm. The bumpkin lyrics and delivery work surprisingly well, thanks mostly to the band's mercilessly schizo shifts from one song section to the next.</p><p>
    At its best, the band doesn't even need to rely on novelty. ""Oh Ana"" is pretty straightforward acoustic pop, rallying around jittery supernatural lyrics and a lush sound crafted by Tegan and Sara producer Howard Redekopp. The plodding title track, with its lugubrious intro guitar riff and stop-start verse, shows that the band's capable of more than just ironic hick ditties. Even the standout song's lyrics wise up, with all three singers commenting on unhealthy body image (""I need a touch up!"") over the album's most dramatic builds.
    </p><p>
    On the flip side, when Mother Mother overstep their eccentric bounds and get downright kitschy, the results are pretty disastrous. The acoustic arpeggios of ""Verbatim"" sound like a loose cover of-- get ready-- TLC's ""No Scrubs"", and Ryan Guldemond's crooning about wearing women's underwear smacks of dorky-white-guy-imitating-black-guy comedy. ""Love and Truth"", while not as egregious, veers uncomfortably close to tackier female artists like Jewel or Sarah McLachlan, relying more on whimsy than artistry. These missteps aside though, the free-spirited <em>Touch Up</em> feels refreshing as an album isolated from a lot of today's worn-out trends and aesthetic mimicry. That two of the album's strongest songs (""Touch Up"" and ""Polynesia"") are relatively earnest is probably coincidental, though Mother Mother's laid-back vibe could use some prodding here or there, at least until their songwriting matures.

The band has no shortage of dramatic ambition on its debut album-- originally released to little notice in 2005-- and leaves no section of the unconscious unmined as its multiple narrators struggle to understand the fallibility of memory and the complicated pathways of personal history.  The first line of ""Julius"" encapsulates the album's central narrative struggle: ""From the start, I've lacked narration.""</p><p>
    Singer Marcus Stoesz's strangled cry-- which variously resembles (when it emerges from the oft-muddy mix) the strident inelegance of Okkervil River's Will Sheff and the winsome, wide-eyed humanism of the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne-- is the litmus test for tolerance of <em>Boyhood</em>.  On album opener ""Fences"", Stoesz emo-wails ""sometimes the world could use more self-control"" over a miniature military march, which both explains the album cover's boy-soldier drawing and renders the <em>Welcome to the Black Parade</em> and <em>Funeral</em> comparisons appropriate. A dramatic mid-song switch into a frenzy of strings and cymbal washes dissolves back into the song proper, demonstrating a tendency toward proggish, constantly shifting structures that distinguishes <em>Boyhood</em> from its peers.</p><p>
    Self-control is the last issue on Paper Airplanes' agenda, and expressionistic excess is the driving force behind the record.  Sepia-toned pastoralism continually gives way to moments of feverish emotion as the record's characters strive to make connections between the past and present, burdened by wanderlust and regret.  On ""Appalachia"", which moves from a basic acoustic pluck to a wash of strings, a man seeks validation for his disobedient memory, and proper explanation for his inexplicable attraction to a place he may only have visited in a dream.  Likewise, the record ends with the plinking electronics of ""Suburban Sprawl"", which recounts a disorienting feeling of stagnation after a move to a new home, questioning ""precisely why I sink deep with images of traveling.""  The last minute of the song, and album, is a tranquil bit of domestic escapism-- the kind of music that would score a 1950s home appliance commercial-- and feels slightly sinister in relation to what's come before it.</p><p>
    True to its title, <em>Boyhood</em> relies on moments from adulthood to trigger unconscious memories of the innocent formative years of life, like an emo version of John Lennon's woozy reverie ""She Said, She Said"".  For their part, however, Paper Airplanes rely on dense, occasionally impenetrable wordplay that, on the page, reads like a stream-of-consciousness diary entry.  ""True Men Like You Men"" remembers an ultra-specific childhood moment: ""I love a hot cup of joe/ No sam you're not old enough/ What a darling, ha ha ha,"" and ""Curious Phantasm"" longs for the impulsiveness of youth from an adult position of forced conformity, through the lyric ""Oh, I wish we had known not to grow up so soon... We're so typical, I'm not permitted to change my ways, they'll lead to my death.""  </p><p>
    The innocence, impulsiveness, and occasional torment of youth have provided inspiration for songs and albums since the earliest moments of the rock era, from Brian Wilson's ""In My Room"" through <em>The Wall</em> and Nirvana's ""Sliver"" and ""Been a Son"". <em> Boyhood</em> is Paper Airplanes' attempt to situate themselves in this canon, and it both succeeds and fails on the strength of its attempted scope.  It's a busy, often confusing record made by a young band intent on proving its maturity, which in the end, feels very appropriate.</p></div>"|9998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9998-boyhood/|6.5|Eric Harvey

    James Murphy started releasing dance music some time between ""B.O.B.""  and ""Get Ur Freak On"". It was a golden age
    for modern pop, a period during which a lot of personal aesthetics
    crumbled. Indie wasn't a dirty word, but it was a meaningless one. Pop, though, wasn't just <em>more</em> meaningless,
    it was more everything. And for the first time in a long while, pop also had its
    evangelicals; people who could argue convincingly in its favor, and who knew how to contextualize it interestingly. That turnover period was an exciting time;  the ideological tension, the feeling that
    something was at stake, the exuberance of redrawing your bounds. The habitual
    mixtape maker in your life probably remembers it well.</p><p>
    Despite eventually remixing Britney Spears and N.E.R.D., Murphy never had a hands-on
    relationship with pop. Nonetheless, his transition out of punk and into dance
    music ran concurrent with this modest revolution, and it's pretty
    much impossible to separate his epiphanies from ours. That early LCD tracks
    like ""Losing My Edge"" used to feature in playlists
    alongside,  say, ""Work It"" or ""...Baby One More Time"" only reinforces the link. So it's fitting that the finest work of Murphy's career is an album that sits squarely at
    the intersection of all those careening ideologies. <em>Sound of Silver</em>, his second as LCD Soundsystem, is as close to a
    perfect hybrid of dance and rock music's values as you're likely to ever hear.</p><p>
    These days, there isn't as much to talk about. It feels like less is up for grabs, as if music fans are gripped by a general fatigue. I'm not sure if you rapidly skim the same articles as I do, but
    apparently 72% of the internet is now made up of free mp3s, while another 14%
    is accompanying blurbs. Sometimes, I don't know how you guys do it. We're besieged and stupefied enough by downloads and mixes
    and remixes and mashups and collections of songs masquerading as albums that an
    album that <em>feels</em> like an album strikes me as positively ideal right now. Thankfully, Murphy-- a self-confessed 1970s rock nerd who grew up in the heyday of art-rock and albums as Statements-- unapologetically
    sets out to make dance records that breathe like proper albums.
    </p>
<p>
    In that respect, <em>Sound of Silver</em> isn't far removed from LCD Soundsystem's
    eponymous 2005 debut, which ultimately tried to do the same thing but fell slightly
    short. While <em>Sound of Silver</em> makes no bones about Murphy's well-known appreciation
    of Brian Eno's pop vocal affectations (""Get Innocuous"", ""Sound of Silver""), the
    Velvet Underground (""New York I Love You""),  or new-wave (""Watch the Tapes""), it never
    feels like a paste job, but rather just the well-considered work of someone
    connecting the dots between the past and the present.
    </p>
<p>
    There's not a single weak track here, and many more already feel classic. ""Sound of Silver"" is a seven-minute suite that morphs from a rumbling,
    ice-cold, no-wave groove into a liquefied jumble of kalimbas, pianos, and fizzy
    synths. ""All My Friends"" begins with a piano riff that sounds not unlike a
    speeding train (or, at least, Steve Reich's approximation of one) and rolls
    downhill into fireworks. And then there's the song that precedes it, and with
    which it combines to form the record's center. A sleek, delicate, and
    effortlessly melodic sliver of electro, ""Someone Great"" is my favorite song of
    the year so far, and constitutes new ground for Murphy both in terms of prettiness and
    poignancy. It's about loss, but the lyric remains tantalizingly
    ambiguous. As with most great songs, its best lines buzz around the edges of
    the story: ""The worst is all the lovely weather/ I'm stunned it's not raining/
    The coffee isn't even bitter/ Because, what's the difference.""
    </p>
<p>
    Murphy used to court spontaneity by refusing to pre-write
    any of his lyrics before going into the vocal booth, claiming in interviews
    that they were all ad-libbed. It's a strategy he's evidently abandoned on <em>Sound
    of Silver</em>,
    and the record is much better for it. On ""All My Friends"", for
    instance, he tackles a favorite subject
    (getting older) from the wrong end of an all-nighter: ""You spend the
    first five
    years trying to get with the plan/ And the next five years trying to be
    with
    your friends again."" On ""North American Scum"", he tackles continental
    divide with straight deadpan: ""Well I don't know, I don't know where to
    begin/ we are North American/ And for those of you who still think
    we're from England / we're like... 'No.'""
    </p>
<p>
    When it's all said and done, Murphy's
    real legacy to dance music will be his production sense. He's an analog
    obsessive with a general aversion to software, and <em>Sound of Silver</em> reflects
    that. Far removed from the compressed, trebly, and overmastered paradigm that's gripped
    electronic music in the last decade, <em>Sound of Silver</em> sounds deep, spacious, and
    full-blooded. (Like, um, an old rock record.) It's an absolute joy to listen
    to, for every possible reason, not the least of which is because, these days,  those epiphanies feel like they're coming
    fewer and farther between.

    The Stooges' first three albums were a perfect triptych. Each record had its own peculiar atmosphere of dread, but when played back-to-back-to-back they form a complementary arc: black-cloud threat (1969's <em>The Stooges</em>) gives way to fiery holocaust (1970's <em>Funhouse</em>) and a post-apocalyptic zombie dance party (1973's <em>Raw Power</em>). Collectively, these records helped spawn every guitar-based subgenre you'll find in a reputable record store: glam, metal, punk, goth, hardcore, indie rock, shoegazer, stoner-rock and noise, and-- through sideman Steve Mackay's fearsome <em>Funhouse</em> sax work-- they even served as many rock fans' gateway to free jazz. There's really nothing more a rock band can or need do in its lifetime. Given that track record, the concept of a fourth Stooges album at this juncture is pretty much doomed from the start.</p><p>
    Sequestered in their home base of Ann Arbor, Michigan, the original Stooges operated in geographical isolation, equally reviled by the pop establishment and the prevailing hippie counterculture, and-- in sharp contrast to their MC5 soul brothers-- almost determinedly oblivious to the turbulent political climate of the time. What made the Stooges such an intimidating prospect was not their aggression so much as their willful indifference to the world around them.</p><p>
    When Iggy changed his surname from Stooge to Pop for <em>Raw Power</em>, there was no small amount of cheek involved in suggesting this self-mutilating drug sponge had aspirations to be a pop idol. But by this point, Iggy <em>is</em> pop: You've seen him in iMac and Motorola ads, on ""Deep Space Nine"" and in <em>Snow Day</em>, and singing with Sum 41. So by default, the strategy is now to subvert from within; if the old Stooges didn't give a shit about Vietnam, the reformed Stooges-- Iggy plus Ron and Scott Asheton, with Mike Watt replacing the late Dave Alexander on bass-- are at least paying attention to Iraq. But it's this very attempt to infuse the Stooges with some ripped-from-the-headlines currency that ultimately downgrades <em>The Weirdness</em> from being a passable aging-rocker reunion album into an atrocious one.
    </p>
<p>
    A big reason why the Stooges' discography has aged so much better than, say, Jefferson Airplane's, is that they avoided topicality and period detail, instead favoring a simple, provocative language-- little dolls with cigarettes and pretty faces going to hell-- that still simmers with deviant suggestion. <em>The Weirdness</em>, on the other hand, is practically begging to be dated, with Iggy dropping sore-thumb references to Dr. Phil, intifada ('cause it rhymes with ""Madonna""), the Christian right, ""a war with no reason,"" and <em>The New York Times</em>' Sunday Styles section, while celebrating his return (""rock critics won't like this at all""; ""you can't tell me this is not a suave thing to do""; ""the leaders of rock don't rock/ This bothers me quite a lot"").
    </p>
<p>
    No one expects Iggy to act like the chest-slashing miscreant of old, but from a vocal-performance standpoint, there's little difference between this and, say, <em>Naughty Little Doggie</em>. Songs like ""The End of Christianity"", ""She Took My Money"", and ""Trollin'"" revert to the old ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" trick of repeating the title until it becomes a chorus, but there's no underlying tension or menace to make them stick. He's never been the most subtle songwriter, but even <em>Raw Power</em>'s ""Penetration"" sounds poetic next to ""my dick is turning into a tree"" (from ""Trollin'""). And when Iggy sings ""My idea of fun/ Is killing everyone,"" he sounds not like a 60-year old punk, but something way less flattering: a 16-year-old one.
    </p>
<p>
    As he recently explained to <em>The New York Times</em>, Iggy instructed Mike Watt to simplify his playing and find his ""inner stupidity,"" so any hope that punk's most dexterous bassist would inspire a further exploration into <em>Funhouse</em>'s funk/jazz extremities goes unfulfilled. Instead, the songs hew more closely to the straight-ahead slash 'n' bash of <em>Raw Power</em> (ironic, since Ron didn't even play guitar on that one) but with the restraint of older, wiser gentlemen who don't quite hate the world and themselves like they used to. 
    </p>
<p>
    Though still capable of producing some sinister riffs (""My Idea of Fun"", ""Mexican Guy""), Ron's wah-wah workouts have lost some of their raygun charge, his fills sounding more typically blues-rocky. Even the return of Mackay fails to provide a corrupting influence, as he dutifully follows the band's lead (see: the Stonesy bar-band jam on ""She Took My Money"") where he once disrupted it. The only one who sounds like he's been waiting 34 years for this opportunity is drummer Scott-- thanks to Steve Albini's off-the-floor recording, his playing sounds more muscular and limber than the claustrophobic production and caveman beats on the early Stooges records would suggest.
    </p>
<p>
    But really, he's just trying his damnedest to kick some life into an album that hideously disgraces the band's original work. When the Stooges opened their South by Southwest set last weekend with a military-strike-precise string of five classics from <em>The Stooges</em> and <em>Funhouse</em>, the ensuing torrent of stage dives and flying beer cans offered convincing evidence they could still give us danger. But that the Stooges can ably relive past glories onstage only reinforces the sobering realization that one of rock'n'roll's most infallible discographies has now been saddled with an unwanted stepchild.

Most of the time, though, the future in music is a trick of perspective. Like the hidden shape in a magic eye picture, it emerges suddenly under the right conditions, made of the same material as the music had been before, but somehow expressing a different topography. And then, just as suddenly, you can't see it anymore.</p><p>
    Could Brazil's funk carioca express the same message, and would we (know how to) listen for it if it did? I don't speak Portuguese and you probably don't either, but something about the unambiguously lustful tone of its MCs suggests that temporal dislocation is the last thing on their minds. But what makes funk carioca in 2007-- once we've moved on from the genre-hopping thrill of simply knowing what it sounds like, once we've adjusted to the sad realization that its biggest impact on Western pop was probably in providing the ballast for Gwen Stefani's ""Wind It Up""-- such an urgent proposition is precisely this strangely disconcerting quality: Listening to <em>Rio Baile Funk: More Favela Booty Beats</em>, you can hear snatches of a potential future emerging from the sedimented pop-culture muck of the past.</p><p>
    The first of Essay Recordings' Rio Baile Funk compilations portrayed funk as uncomplicated, pop-focused party music, similar to dancehall and soca at their most friendly. Simple electro beats gave way to brief flares of sampled Afro-Brazilian percussion, MCs chanted earworm vocal hooks, and melodies were ripped shamelessly from the annals of popular music. Two years on, the music's fundamental ingredients are unchanged, but this brilliant sequel feels like an entirely different proposition. With few memorable songs or choruses, <em>More Favela Booty Beats</em> is undoubtedly less of a pop phenomenon than its predecessor, but it's much better dance music: the grooves are tighter, denser, and more heavily invested in exploiting the mind-bending qualities of syncopation inherent in the collision between Afro-Brazilian percussion and digital production. Less content than before to be mistaken for a simple composite of old school electro and Brazilian MCs, it's not so much that funk has gotten more subtle or sophisticated (if anything the sound is even baser) but rather that it's now clearly and resolutely its own beast, drawing from a host of influences but in thrall to none of them.
    </p><p>
    Most radically, funk is returning the art of sampling to urban dance music. Whereas previously pop tunes were stolen and recreated almost in their entirety, now producers are enamored with cutting up and mutilating their sample sources into near-unrecognizable jitter riffs of melodic intensity. The sample sources range from the high-pitched guitar from Guns &amp; Roses' ""Sweet Child of Mine"" to the amorous robot in Benny Benassi's ""Satisfaction"", but in all cases their role is limited to being just one more guilty pleasure in an endless parade of sounds and effects.  The MCs have also been subject to the same decentralization: Rather than one MC providing a full-blown rap, many tracks feature a host of different voices all offering a sampled line or two, each contribution dueling to be the best sounding, the little vocal hook that drive the crowd wild-- much in the same way that early jungle or big beat pillaged rap for discrete hooks to give their music some punch.
    </p>
<p>
    Sometimes the vocals literally become the music: on DJ Disconhecido's ""Dedinho Pro Alto"", a sampled MC's shouts are looped into a percussive rhythm, before leaping vertiginously into a trebly computerized stutter, its seasick interaction with the loping bongo percussion so eerily reminiscent of early 90s breakbeat rave techno that I'm half-tempted to call it homage. But the key to this music's success is that it is precisely not homage: If funk is among the most cheerfully ignorant of all current pop music forms, it uses this ignorance to work through the impasse of intricate studio assembly that faces the spectrum of accomplished Western pop sounds. While we lurch perpetually and dogmatically between mild advances in production techniques and revivalist retro maneuvers, funk's short-circuit between pop formula and sonic chaos suggests a way out. Rough and ready, its crudely psychedelic collision of percussion, hooks and pure energy might take us back to a future we thought had been forgotten.

    Jesse Sykes knows what you want: ""Tell me what you need to
    see,"" she sings elegantly on ""Eisenhower Moon"", the first track on her
    third album. The answer: ""half sadness, half fury."" That <em>Like Love Lust and the Open Halls of the Soul</em> will veer more toward
    fury than sadness doesn't become apparent until the second song, ""LLL"" (one of
    two de facto title tracks), which builds to a forceful conclusion that would
    have been unthinkable on either of the band's previous albums. Where those
    records trafficked a lustrous yet monlithic folk rock that matched Sykes' voluminous voice, <em>Like
    Love Lust and the Open Halls of the Soul</em>, on the other hand, is just as
    adventurous as that lengthy title promises, changing up moods and music and
    taking Sykes and the band outside their comfort zone: from the skipping
    indignation of ""You Might Walk Away"" and the outright outrage of ""I Like the
    Sound"" to the psychedelic wonder of ""Spectral Beings"" to the gentle gospel
    drift of ""The Air Is Thin"". The band incorporates an impressive array of styles
    and sounds-- SoCal pop, desert rock, country, and folk-- into these songs to
    create its own ""cosmic American music,"" to borrow Gram Parsons' phrase.
    Certainly they want to expound upon the past, not to replicate it, which makes <em>Like Love Lust</em> their most adventurous
    album to date, and in some ways their most calculated and self-conscious.</p><p>
    Sykes' voice, which sounds like Marianne Faithfull's if she'd
    hailed from the American Southwest, is the perfect instrument for communicating
    this concoction of emotions, but in finding new ways to use her voice, her
    reach occasionally exceeds her grasp. She never sounds entirely comfortable
    among the handclaps on the upbeat ""You Might Walk Away"" or the Fifth Dimension
    bum-bumbumbum-ba's on the jarring ""I Like the Sound"" or the loungey horns on ""Aftermath"".
    On the other hand, she's right at home singing the la la la's of ""Station Grey""
    and sighing the airy backdrop of ""Spectral Beings"", as grainy and atmospheric
    as a Jarmusch film. Sykes creates a choir of herselves on ""How Will We Know?"",
    which builds to a lovely desert coda-- one of the album's many potential
    showclosers. By contrast, Sykes's songwriting voice is never as coolly
    confident on <em>Like Love Lust</em> as her
    physical voice. Over three albums, however, she has developed a flair for elliptical
    imagery, giving the impression that she writes as a means to search for some
    larger truth. If Sykes' quest leads her to vague sentiments about raindrops on
    broken glass and the soul's open corridors, more often than not it makes the
    songs sound even more earthily enigmatic.</p><p>
    Even though Sykes gets first billing, her three albums are
    as much about the Sweet Hereafter as they are about her. The rhythm
    section of Bill Herzog and Eric Eagle rumble dependably, and Anne Marie
    Ruljancich's violin hovers curiously throughout the album. In ex-Whiskeytowner
    Phil Wandscher especially, she's found an ideal musical partner, the Emmylou to
    her Gram Parsons. Wandscher's playing sounds looser and even more central to
    the songs than on previous efforts. ""LLL"" builds to a close on his whitewater
    solo, and ""Hard Not to Believe"" rumbles sensuously with his descending chords. Especially
    at the end of ""How Will We Know?"" and ""Station Grey"", his guitar and Sykes's
    voice intertwine naturally and closely, striking the perfect equilibrium on an
    album that often feels out of balance.

He is a pretty boy.  His band, Pagoda, in which he plays guitar and sings, had their record released in February by Thurston Moore, who first met Pitt when they both worked on Larry Clark's <em>Bully</em>.  Ryan Donowho, an ""O.C."" bit player and aspiring actor-- also plucked from the street, at which time he was playing drums as a street-musician-- played drums on the record before leaving the band for a nascent acting career.</p><p>
    But it's not the youthful musical theater indiscretions, or the hipster bio, or the famous friends, or even the perception that he's an actor slumming acting like a musician that will make Pitt's record occasional tough going, but the fact that he once played Kurt Cobain in a movie and now sings like him on his debut CD.</p><p>
    To my mind, there are worse crimes (say, ripping off Pearl Jam, and propagating that Eddie Vedder-howl all the way into the new century).  And though some critics think that American pop-rock can have a second act only when filtered through a foreign country, accent, and wardrobe, I'd say uncomplicated ambition and admiration don't automatically make you a con man or a shill or a rip-off artist, but just a band that likes other bands and wants to become a band, too.  Which is more or less how I hear Pagoda.  Think, for instance, about the upcoming YACHT/Lucky Dragons Nirvana remix 12"", and why no one will have a problem with it.</p><p>
    Lead single ""Lesson Learned"" does indeed sound like ""Rape Me"", including as referents an ascending refrain and muted power chords.  Other Nirvanaisms are ""Amego""'s hyper-inarticulate ""Damn la la la la My Friend la la la la"" segue into ""blah blah blah blah,"" the one-to-two-word 1990s song titling, and ""Fetus"", which seems like it must be a <em>Nevermind</em> joke, right down to the junk cameo.  It's also clearly a song about Michael Pitt's girlfriend/wife/lover getting an abortion.  One interpretation here is that Pagoda are satirical geniuses-- ""Amego"" also interpolates snips of samples of serious sounding things such as <em>weapon of mass destruction</em> and <em>war on terrorism</em> while rhyming ""amego"" with ""loco"" and ""Mexico.""</p><p>
    Other critical hotspots include ""Voices"", which has more than a little ""Bad to the Bone"" to it, Pitt doing a deadpan reading from what appears to be his journal in the final 10-minute opus ""I Do"", and the female orgasm noises that appear earlier in that song.  Plus the junk, dope, and dope-sick talk, which is either totally appropriate or totally inappropriate for a record this heavily influenced by Nirvana.</p><p>
    If all this makes you want to throw on some Nirvana and not some Pagoda, go ahead, but listening to this record, it occurs: what was the last band that really did sound like Nirvana? Their aspirations are so familiar as to be laughable until you realize why they're familiar.  Pitt, a year older than me, has my generational preoccupations, unreconstructed.  If he's moved on less than the rest of us, who could hate him for forming the band we once all wanted to be in?<br/></p></div>"|10003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10003-pagoda/|5.5|Zach Baron

    For all of the pandemonium over the indie rock gold-record mainstream-radio-play explosion, few of the bands who breached Clear Channel's glass ceiling were actually longtime members of the small-label fraternity. The Shins and the Arcade Fire, to pick two of the bigger success stories, had relatively short histories before raising their profile beyond college campuses, while more seasoned groups with major-label money-sacks like Built to Spill and Mercury Rev never cracked the <em>Billboard</em> top 50.  I could get all crotchety and bemoan this trend as the Johnny-Come-Latelies pulling the rug out from underneath the old vets, but it's more likely just a matter of younger bands sounding more enthusiastic on their second or third record and working with a fresher formula.</p><p>
    Of course, Modest Mouse are the exception to this generalization, having scored in the hit-song jackpot 10 years and four full-length albums into their career.  Perennially relegated to the second tier of the 90s indie-rock league (I still remember mis-learning of them as a BtS spinoff), modern rock chart-topper ""Float On"" allowed Isaac Brock to have the last laugh on his former indie label brethren, as he enjoyed the kind of crossover hit that's eluded so many major-label recruits since the heady days of grunge.  What was even more astounding was the fact that Modest Mouse-- mob cries of ""sellout!"" notwithstanding-- didn't really compromise their sound for mass consumption: Brock's weird yelp-shout retained its volatile quaver, the band's punched-up rhythm section still sounded sharp and vital, and the hunt for cosmic guitar pedal settings still sounded like their driving passion.</p><p>
    The album that gave birth to ""Float On"", <em>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</em>, was similarly unmitigated down to its mouthful title, but indicated that Brock wasn't treading water either, tweaking his sound to incorporate a touch of programming and the Tom Waits worship of his Ugly Casanova side project.  <em>We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</em> continues that measured consistency, preserving the core Modest Mouse sound despite the recruitment of historic guitar figure Johnny Marr while gently nudging toward new directions.  
    </p>
<p>
    Ironically, the most successful track on <em>We Were Dead</em> is the one that pushes hardest against the group's established formula: the almost gaudy single ""Dashboard"".  With Modest Mouse's trademark itchy guitars all but drowned out by brass fanfares and slurring strings, ""Dashboard"" is the Vegas version of ""Float On"", and it works as an experiment to see just how far they can push the dissonance of Brock's multi-tracked barking against slick, commercially ambitious surroundings. 
    </p>
<p>
    Had the rest of the record gone further down this path of orchestration indulgence, it would've been either a classic or a disaster (just ask Trail of Dead, who've spent their time since <em>Source Tags and Codes</em> trying and utterly failing to create a similar kind of symphonic indie hard-rock). But instead of that dice-roll, <em>We Were Dead</em> continues to refine Brock's aesthetic, producing another solid (if not necessarily great) record. The development is clear in the way ""Parting of the Sensory"" smoothly evolves from foul-mouthed acoustic lament to boxcar-hobo hoedown, or on tracks like ""Fly Trapped in a Jar"", which takes an abrupt left turn halfway through from a dark, bristly screamer that echoes their earlier work to a jagged but dancey post-punk groove.  Those latter moments are likely where Marr's much-anticipated influence is most obvious, but even then it's subtle; rather than impossibly sounding like the Smiths all of a sudden, the band has fun pilfering the rhythmic sheets of mid-period Talking Heads on songs like ""Education"" or ""Invisible"".
    </p>
<p>
    So yes, despite the hefty presence of Marr, it's still undeniably Brock's band, and his development as a frontman is most apparent in his impressive inventory of vocal characters: There's ornery/shouty Brock, Waitsian-growl Brock, spoken-word proselytizer Brock, wounded/reflective Brock, and countless permutations of all of these.  Many of those personae appear in the same song or even the same line, singing backup to each other on opener ""March Into the Sea"" or allowing the singer to play call-and-response with himself on ""Parting of the Sensory"". And when Brock can't modulate his throat quite as sweetly as he'd like, he calls in the Shins' James Mercer, whose counterpoint on ""Florida"" and the excellent ""We've Got Everything"" help put a couple of strong follow-up singles in the can.

    Unless my radio barometer is totally out of whack, 2007 should be another banner year for the disorienting experience of hearing Modest Mouse sandwiched between Fergie and Fall Out Boy, not to mention <strong><u><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAXzu4PX6e0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered on ""American Idol""</a></u></strong>.  There's no reason this development should be met with scorn; if anything, Modest Mouse should be championed for exposing a larger audience to a sound in line with classic indie rock, rather than aiming for more traditional rock sounds like many of their more accessible indie contemporaries.<em> </em>That a window has briefly opened in the greater cultural consciousness to make room for Modest Mouse on the airwaves would have been unthinkable at the start of the decade; that they've remained so true to their core aesthetic in light of the temptation that success undoubtedly brings is rarer still.<br/></p></div>"|10010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10010-we-were-dead-before-the-ship-even-sank/|7.8|Rob Mitchum

    Even if the work it's rendered hasn't always been
    remarkable, Kieran Hebden's path over the past three years warrants respect. In
    late 2004, Hebden-- as Four Tet-- finished his fourth LP, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Everything Ecstatic</span><span>,</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span><span>and
    released it the next year to wide acclaim. He'd become one of the few
    home-listening electronic musicians to find substantial popularity within the indie mainstream,
    but he didn't rest on his laurels. Instead, he got to work, producing
    an album by New England improvisers Sunburned Hand of the Man (out later this
    year) and devoting his talents to work with 63-year-old jazz/soul/rock drummer
    Steve Reid. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Reid and Hebden went into the studio in March 2005, four
    days after first playing together, and emerged with two albums, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Exchange
    Session Vol. 1</span><span> and </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">2</span><span>. Those sessions were all free, long-form
    improvisation, and-- as fascinating as Hebden and Reid could be sonically-- they
    certainly had their foibles as a nebulous duo. Hebden was playfully
    temperamental, his impatience causing him to jump the gun and storm the tape
    with sounds that didn't need to be there. It felt as though the then
    25-year-old Hebden was still trying to learn to listen and respond. But Reid wasn't in a rush: Over the past four
    decades, he's played with James Brown, Fela Kuti, and Miles Davis, and </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The
    Exchange Sessions </span><span>still found him fond of
    big, shifty grooves led with his sticky, trademark kick drum. The duo was
    strides better on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Spirit Walk</span><span>,
    recorded with a nonet for Soul Jazz in 2005. Hebden was improvising </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">around</span><span> people, hiding under a saxophone and reappearing
    alongside Reid's beat. Reid was a confident, ambitious bandleader. It worked.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But Hebden and Reid return to duo work for <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Tongues</span><span>, their pop album: In conversation, Hebden mentions
    that, in exploring his relationship with Reid, he became fascinated with Reid's
    interests, abilities and experiences in pop and rock. Reid, after all, played
    on Martha and the Vandella's 1964 hit ""Dancing in the Streets"". For </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Tongues</span><span>, the duo puts temporal and thematic limits on its
    improvisations. Hebden introduced a pre-arranged melodic idea, and he and Reid
    improvised for approximately five minutes around each theme. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Unfortunately, these restrictions cut the duo no favors. The
    very fundamental differences that marred <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Exchange Sessions</span><span> are more apparent for the </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Tongues</span><span> concentrate: Reid is still older and wiser, and he
    acts like they have all of the time in the world here. His variations over
    Hebden's scrambled baritone sax samples for ""People Be Happy"" essentially
    involve adding cymbals to a tom-and-kick beat. He's equally metronomic on
    opener and single ""The Sun Never Sets"", refusing to step aside from his groove
    at all. Hebden, much the same hasty improviser as he was during </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The
    Exchange Sessions</span><span>, tries to compensate.
    During the last minute of ""The Sun Never Sets,"" he smothers the melody with
    spirals of noise, forcing Reid out of the pocket and into an unnatural finish.
    He's directing the workflow, even when it doesn't need any help, forcing things
    into early exits through cacophonous finishes. Hebden goes wild to end most
    tracks, mistaking noisy washes for climaxes and cleansing. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But that's only a symptom: The underlying problem here seems
    to be that Hebden still isn't comfortable in his own skin while improvising,
    with Reid or otherwise. Reid has called Hebden his musical soulmate, and that
    sounds like it could be true. But their relationship is still <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">just</span><span> young and promising. That's audible in the missteps
    on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Tongues</span><span>. Hebden issues
    retractions several times, as on the danceable ""Brain"". Otherwise one of the
    best tracks here, Hebden teases Reid's rhythm with flat electronic hums two
    minutes in, but-- after two tries-- he can't get it right. He throws the idea to
    the wind, eclipsing the rest of the track with a five-second sustain of the
    same tone, eventually breaking it and the track apart. Reid follows perfectly,
    but he shouldn't have to so early into the take. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Sure, improvising doesn't require finding a course and
    sticking to it, but-- given a time limit for working around finite
    themes-- admissions of error sound like inexperience, immaturity, and a lack of
    confidence converging. Hebden's trying, and that's venerable enough. But,
    eventually, he's going to have to have to treat his improvisational
    undertakings like it's more than something he's doing to buck his own trends.

    A complete history of Swedish popular music would strain even the most long-winded reviewer. The Scandinavian nation responsible for
    the coolly melodic pop of the Concretes, El Perro del Mar, Jens Lekman, Love Is
    All, and Peter Bjorn &amp; John also brings us the unguarded cuteness of Hello
    Saferide and I'm From Barcelona, the danceable insecurities of Robyn and Sally
    Shapiro, the visceral psych-rock of Dungen, and the Knife's 2006-defining haunted
    house. Blame Sweden,
    too, for Soundtrack of Our Lives and Yngwie fucking Malmsteen. Good thing
    they're peace-loving, right?</p><p>
    Stockholm's Labrador Records
    has helped define the ""Swedish pop"" sound now heard in club nights
    from London to Berlin. Cheekily titled <em>Labrador 100: A Complete History of Popular Music</em> celebrates the influential indie label's 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary with one song from each
    of its first 100 releases (including a new track from dream-poppers the Radio
    Dept.). At more than five hours, the four-disc set contains more than enough
    overlooked gems for indie-pop fans to obsess over, argue about, and fall in
    love with. Labrador specializes in sweetly chiming pop in the old Sarah
    Records mold; its sound has broadened considerably over the years, but don't
    expect any of the macho garage-rock that put Sweden on the <em>NME</em>'s pub-crawl map in the early 00s.</p><p>
    Girlish whispers and Morrissey-esque
    enunciations are the norm. Early <em>Labrador</em><em> 100</em>
    tracks by bands like Starlet or Airliner display echoes of the Field Mice's
    bedsit lo-fi, while Pelle Carlberg and his band Edson apply self-conscious wit
    to Belle &amp; Sebastian's initial hushed tones. The compilation also makes
    room for Laurel Music's country-inflected yearning, Douglas Heart's shoegaze
    twilights, Irene's bubblegum soul, the Legends' noise-swathed Northern soul, the
    homemade electro-pop of Club 8 or Waltz for Debbie, the Pulp archness of
    Corduroy Utd. and Loveninjas, and the shimmering new wave of newcomers the Mary
    Onettes. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Out of such gentle nostalgia, <em>Labrador</em><em> 100</em> presents song after song of
    would-be Perfect Pop Songs-- and plenty of them are pretty near perfect indeed. Suburban
    Kids With Biblical Names set forth a manifesto on their devastatingly catchy ""Rent a Wreck"": ""I want to turn all their dance floors into a burning
    inferno of ba-ba-ba."" Their labelmates have similar designs. Jangly Labrador standouts Acid
    House Kings ba-da-da on the gorgeous ""Say Yes if You Love Me"", breezy
    synth-poppers Mondial na-na-na on ""Undeserved Potential"", and New
    Order-echoing dance-pop duo Tribeca ooh-ooh-ooh on defiantly adolescent breakup
    tune ""Teenage"".  Hell, [ingenting]
    sing in Swedish, but language clearly isn't the issue here. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    For all their world-conquering melodies, <em>Labrador</em><em> 100</em>'s best songs have an uneasy
    relationship with mass appeal. They're shy. ""It's my favorite song,
    but I don't like the crowd,"" Sambassadeur explain on one of <em>my</em> favorite songs here, the Velvet
    Underground-via-C86 ""Between the Lines"". This is pop, but it's also
    personal: I might not see the appeal of Wan Light's glassy-voiced space-pop or
    Hurray's nose-plugged twee, but surely someone will. In Jude Rogers'
    exhaustive liner notes, Acid House Kings' Niklas Angergard describes Labrador's
    essence as ""quality pop music which sometimes no one likes, but hey, it
    doesn't matter that much as long as you like it yourself."" No wonder Sweden
    doesn't have wars.

But for Seattle foursome Welcome, the hook is less a metaphorical construct than a literal one-- a sharp, pointy thing that lures you in by breaking skin and drawing blood.</p><p>
    Their Fat Cat debut, <em>Sirs</em>, pulls off the neat trick of feeling more accessible and immediate than it really is. For indie rock fans who came of age during the mid-90s, the album will make you wistful for an era when Sub Pop was banking on the Grifters and Spoon were just a quaint little Pixies rip-off.  Opener ""All Set"" provides an instant microcosm of Welcome's slop-pop ethos,  an exercise in mod madness that's knocked askew by wobbly Keith Moon tom-tom rolls and out-of-tune guitar shards that fortuitously converge into a roiling riff, the end result sounding not unlike the Creation's ""Making Time"" with every second note removed.</p><p>
    There's an unabated momentum to these songs, which twitch and shout their way to the finish line in just over 28 minutes. But the brevity is more a product of restlessness than focus, and less a matter of distilling a song to its essence than not being able to figure out what that essence is and losing interest. Welcome are in such a hurry to get to the next chord/change/anything, that their songs feel unfinished-- a quality that lends them an unresolved tension, but also keeps Welcome at an emotional distance, and prevents <em>Sirs</em> from projecting anything more than a spirited randomness. Frontman Pete Brand's voice has a pleasingly gruff familiarity-- pledging to the same Beatles-by-way-of-Budweiser school as Bob Pollard-- but that's the most we ever feel for him; likewise, bassist Jo Claxton's complementary Georgia Hubley coos neither encourage nor diminish the chaos around her.</p><p>
    If nothing else, Welcome are an interesting case study of a band with a clear affection for 60s psychedelic pop, but whose fear of giving in to easy nostalgia drives them to deliberate acts of self-sabotage-- on the title track, Brand spends the first two minutes fighting against creepy, squealing atmospherics with some churning riffage and would-be-anthemic verses, only to get rerouted into a ponderous bass dirge with minimal dramatic purpose. And yet there are moments where common sense prevails: ""First"" climbs a mountain of sound on a majestic, repeated power chord that melts blissfully in the sun; and the catchy bass-riff propulsion of ""Actual Glad"" suggests an alternative universe where Kurt Cobain actually signed to K Records instead of just getting the logo tattooed on his arm. When they let a good idea develop for longer than 30 seconds, Welcome show themselves capable of inspired work-- even if they make it sound accidental.</p></div>"|9994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9994-sirs/|5.9|Stuart Berman

    grim dirge. ""Thirsty"", the third song on her full-length debut, is
    the record's quintessential track, the guitar and banjo sounding like they're
    walking uphill on a dirt road and collapsing every other step from exhaustion.
    And Milena's deep voice, reminiscent of Jessie Sykes' nicotine-stained croon
    but with more quivering vibrato, staggers a couple steps ahead, bound for
    someplace dark and probably a little scary.</p><p>
    The bedroom production on <em>Seven Sisters </em>is full, the electronics and
    samples combining with acoustic instruments and odd synths in that way that
    artists on Monika and Tomlab always seem adept, but the real draw is Milena's
    voice. She often doubles or triples it, almost as often adds a bit of
    processing to make it sound a hair less human, but these tweaks and layers
    exist mostly reinforce that she sounds very alone. This is a hermetic record,
    very much one person carefully making tracks alone in her apartment, even when
    guests chip in. Tord Lövik from the Riverendings duets on the gorgeous
    ""Love Feel You Do"", and with the slightly out-of-tune acoustic guitar
    zeroing in on a couple notes and the rolled-off high end it almost sounds like Jandek
    and Nancy covering some Townes Van Sant tune. It's romantic longing at its
    saddest and most fatalistic.</p><p>
    While its solitary nature certainly works to <em>Seven Sisters'</em>
    advantage, sometimes it feels a bit too claustrophobic, hemmed-in to the point
    of queasiness. There's an odd cast to the production here, certain woozy
    samples of strings that seem about 4-bits deep and that stretch and contract at
    irregular intervals. Somewhere lurking inside ""Figs Tree"" is a
    straightforward murder ballad but the production is impossible to get a fix on,
    like a melodramatic film sound track recovered from a degraded print left to
    rot in the studio's basement. ""How Ode"" is even more warped, its
    backward music box and wildly distorted vocals that seem to waft out of one of some
    postmodern deconstruction of a Kurt Weill operetta.
    </p><p>
    Milena has succeeded at constructing an odd and original gothic mood piece,
    but the headspace of <em>Seven Sisters </em>is the sort I'd only want to visit
    occasionally. ""Lily Wyatt"", a catchy acoustic pop song that stands
    out here like a starlight mint in a bowl full of razor blades, is the track
    here I keep returning to. That it works so well in a style outside the rest of
    the record suggests that Milena is an artist in control of her talent, ready to
    take it in different directions when so inclined.

While it's inspired by the stuff of error-- the scratched record; the errant scrap of rhythm; the corrupted file-- the genre produces some of the most anally precise music available today. In film, the glitch tends to be used pragmatically-- the montage, for example, serves narrative compression. But in music, its use tends toward the obsessive-- it's a way to reclaim the mistake in the name of order, and is often accompanied by a magpie's proclivity for hoarding. The glitch has been employed in conjunction with a broad variety of tones, from Autechre's surgical rigor to Dntel's igneous fluidity. It's an ideal technique for control freaks: Anything that goes wrong in the process of composition has the potential to be cut, pasted and looped until it goes right.</p>
<p>Secret Mommy mastermind Andy Dixon's lively take on glitch-based music tends to conflate process with theme. His <i>Hawaii 5.0</i> EP used samples that Dixon collected on vacation in Hawaii, while the <i>Wisdom EP</i> used sounds from his wisdom tooth removal operation, not unlike Matmos's surgery-sampling <i>A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure</i>. But if Dixon's methods are familiar, he uses them to produce a glitch-pop prosody that's unique to him. It's conceptual, but it's also hooky, luscious, and startlingly alive. Overclocked percussion that helixes and strobes is <i>de rigueur</i>; ditto lush acoustic melodies that stutter and glide. Lush aural pinwheels blossom and burst at such an astonishing clip that there's hardly time to register one before the next is upon you.</p>
<p><i>Plays</i> operates according to a single restriction: No electronic instruments were used in its creation. Dixon and a revolving cast of supplementary musicians recorded improvised performances on guitar, woodwinds, horns, and strings, then Dixon cut and pasted these recordings into his usual neon scrimshaw. ""String Lake"" harnesses sprightly acoustic guitar loops, chirpy strings, and moistly sputtering percussion into a hyperactive bounce, while on ""Grand About the Mouth"", a threnody of falsetto harmonies, mellow woodwinds, and epiphanic whistles wends euphorically around sharp flecks of guitar. Cheery horns cut clean figures through the brambly stammers of ""Diciduism"". This template extends to encompass the album-- minutely sculpted rhythm tracks flicker frantically as bright, breezy melodies are sketched out broadly.</p>
<p>While this technique produces invariably engaging results, <i>Plays</i> tends to be most interesting during its genre exercises. ""Kool Aid River"" is Secret Mommy's take on emo: Guest vocalist Gregory Adams' voice peals out with readymade conviction amid the track's rubbery squeaks, sometimes breaking hard and clear above the mix, sometimes blurring choppily into it. And the fluttery ""I Can't Get Down"" sounds like an homage to Madlib-style indie-rap, with its helium-sucking vocals and its pitch-shifting beats. With its assiduous eye for bold contrasts, elegant symmetries, and intricately stylized lines, <i>Plays</i> is like a really slick silk-screened flyer, translating visual impact into sonic. You could argue that certain ideas on the album are boring, but there's literally never a dull moment in its high velocity flurry of color and shape.</p></div>"|9989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9989-plays/|7.3|Brian Howe

It was tense and paranoid, and El-P seemed to be peering over his shoulder at the gathering storm. The album's production, blending waves of cacophony over broken rhythms, was similarly bleak. And while <em>Fan Dam</em> didn't anticipate everything-- who, aside from perhaps Donald Rumsfeld, could've foreseen the sanctification of torture as a tool of ""freedom""-- it did give form to our own feelings of dread and helplessness.</p><p>
    Though <em>I'll Sleep When You're Dead</em> is (slightly) more textured and melodic than its predecessor, El-P's production is still amongst the most jarring in hip-hop, and his themes and shading remain pitched to black, haunted by the prospect of a dystopian near-future: Cigarettes are extinguished on wet palms, prisoners are raped before execution, and El-P-- our crazed, sometimes indecipherable narrator-- sticks his head out of a hoopde, screaming ""freedom is mine."" In this world, as in ours, we're coasting in the fast lane ""with doom and disease."" Like El-Producto says, ""The whole design got my mind crying.""</p><p>
    ""Tasmanian Pain Coaster"", the album's first track, kicks off with a sample from <em>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</em>. ""Do you think that if you were falling in space that you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?"" the first voice (Moira Kelley's Donna Hayward) asks. ""Faster and faster,"" heroine Laura Palmer replies. ""For a long time, you wouldn't feel anything. And you'd burst into fire, forever."" <br/>
</p><p>
    El-P spends 13 tracks exploring the freefalling fatalism of that quote. America is ablaze and El-P is fucked up from the floor up: ""Why should I be sober when God is so clearly dusted out his mind?"" the rapper asks on ""Smithereens"". The reply never comes, and he stumbles along like Rory Cochrane, too dazed to be angry or to put all the pieces together. On ""Drive"", he talks of a kid who ""fuel injected a speed ball,"" before later admitting with a wink ""my triple-A card has one too many initials."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The album works best at these moments, when it's sneering into the abyss and spitting out gallows humor. ""I stood up for the God's of ore mining/ In a military humvee with no bullet-proof siding,"" El-P raps on ""Drive"". Afterwards, a distant voice chimes in, ""sorry about that, guys"" as robotic backing vocals emerge from a miasma of corrosive, clunky rhythms to provide a mocking refrain of sorts. Elsewhere, lead-single ""Smithereens"" begins with a snippet of what could be a sunny, Bob Dorough track, before a voice interjects, ""Bring me the dramatic intro machine,"" and squishy horror synths introduce one of El-P's most caustic songs to date.
    </p>
<p>
    But perhaps the most explicit instance of the album's dark humor comes at the end of ""Habeas Corpses"", which imagines El-P and guest rapper Cage as workers aboard a futuristic prison ship. Their task is to ""facilitate the end"" for the incarcerated. (From the gunshots sprinkled throughout, it's easy to imagine what that would entail.) ""It's almost romantic,"" Cage comments, but El-P doesn't share the enthusiasm. He's fallen in love with prisoner #247681Z, and his job is suddenly full of contradiction and nuance. He tries to escape, but of course escape is illusionary and temporary.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Habeas Corpus"" is similar in spirit to <em>Fantastic Damage</em>'s ""Stepfather Factory"", and provides a makeshift metaphor for our own country's desire for vindication and liberation. But, as the song fades, El-P is unwilling to cop to his own seriousness, and the track fades with him and Cage laughing off the drama they've just conjured.</p><p>
    The jaded pose is a good look for El, and when the album tries to emote, such as on ""The Overly Dramatic Truth"", it falls flat on its face. The song is full of cringe-worthy lines such as ""you deserve the ignorance and bliss that I wish I still had,"" and is too emo for its own good. But when El-P sticks to what he knows-- chronicling the grime -<em>I'll Sleep When You're Dead</em> is every bit as good as its predecessor. It's a scary, difficult album, but one well suited for our times.

    John Cale's association with minimalist composer La Monte Young-- struck the
    mainline for a new style of pop, similarly connected to raga's enveloping drone. Uh, maybe
    you've heard of Can, Brian Eno, Sonic Youth, or My Bloody Valentine?</p><p>
    When listening to A Sunny Day in Glasgow, it's perhaps best to put yourself in the frame of mind you might assume for those bands, too. Sure, this
    brother-sister trio aren't in the same league, but they're one of several
    exciting young acts keeping up ambient-pop's ethereal flame (a few years after M83 and others put their electronic spin on <em>Loveless</em> swoon). Where Atlanta's Deerhunter
    echo the psych-rock meditations of Spacemen 3, these Philadelphia tweegazers lose themselves in
    the trebly haze of early Creation Records, pop melodies barely shining
    through all the layers of noise. Then they kill you with ramshackle C86 adorableness.</p><p>
    On <em>Scribble Mural
    Comic Journal</em>, A Sunny Day in Glasgow<em>
</em>sculpt fluffy electronic textures, overdubbed funhouse-mirror guitars, and Kate-Bush-down-a-well vocals into a debut album that warps (and greatly
    improves upon) last year's self-released <em>The Sunniest Day Ever EP</em>. The
    project's founder, Ben Daniels of local ""supergroup"" King Kong Ding
    Dong, twists the sweetness in identical twins Lauren
    and Robin's voices into eerie new forms, whether off-kilter dial tones to open the thick--
    and, hey, <em>ringing--</em> ""A Mundane
    Phonecall to Jack Parsons"", echoing raindrops on ""Our Change Into
    Rain Is No Change at All (Talkin' 'bout Us)"", or stereo-panning schoolgirl chants amid alien
    guitars on ""C'Mon"" . The sisters' soft breathiness is most, well, breathtaking on cosmopolitan teenage lament ""The Horn Song"",
    or with gliding guitar, pebbly beats, and a moonstruck melody on album highlight ""5:15
    Train"".</p><p>
    Within A Sunny Day in Glasgow's
    aesthetic, their singing is less the point than the sonic environment they help create (for those gorgeous, submerged tunes!). So deceptively
    casual opener ""Wake Up Pretty"" dreams up the surreal-life dance
    party that is the ensuing ""No. 6 Van Karman Street"", and ""Ghost
    in the Graveyard"" begins with the pounding drums and background dissonance
    of an impassioned anthem by actual Glaswegians the Twilight Sad, then never develops into one. Meanwhile, ""Panic Attacks Are What Make
    Me 'Me'"" swells into a jingling alarum, shifting the details gradually enough to encourage what Eno called ""perceptual drift,"" and then suddenly changing direction. Dizzy? No, dazzled. 
    </p>
<p>
    As with Deerhunter's <em>Cryptograms</em>,
    A Sunny Day in Glasgow's debut becomes
    clearer as it nears an end. Album closer ""The Best Summer Ever"" at
    last distills the band's meteorological whorls into a psych-pop sunburst
    befitting its title. One of the band's older songs (it opened <em>The Sunniest Day Ever EP</em>) this track
    illustrates a notable divergence: While Deerhunter have moved toward tightly focused
    songs, the most recent recordings on <em>Scribble Mural Comic Journal</em> venture further into nuanced
    atmospherics. From a certain point of view, their journey is the same.

    My Latest Novel came together in a soggy Glasgow suburb where, yes, they
    read. In fact, during an interview, they named Jack Kerouac and Aldous Huxley
    as influences, the sources of their outlaw intelligence. Their musical
    pedigree-- tying them to the precious, anxious silver age of Scottish
    indie-pop-- meshes well with this literary pedigree. All of this translates on
    the band's debut <em>Wolves</em> into a fiercely split personality,
    symphony-to-God harmonies, and poetic, double-edged oratory.</p><p>
    ""The Hope Edition"" captures that bittersweet spirit. But My Latest
    Novel adds something new to the blueprint drawn by the Jeepster and Chemikal
    Underground labels: space. Marrying their region's already offbeat pop
    sensibility to the patient, anti-pop wanderlust championed by Montreal's
    Constellation Records, the songs on <em>Wolves</em> claim room to inflate and
    deflate, to meander, to shake loose that dammed-up anomie.</p><p>
    But they are more than a 2+2=5 union of Mogwai and Belle and Sebastian,
    their fellow Glaswegians. Against the stillness of the Scottish rustbelt, they
    rebel in their own way, roving perpetually from quiet to loud and singing to
    talking, light to dark, slow to fast, their restlessness an antidote to sagging
    spirits. ""Ghosts"" begins with the flicker of guitars, as if a
    spaghetti-western duel was brewing in the distance, before violins and a spasm
    of primal drumming break the silence. Narcissism provides the target here. In
    the raucous, martial ""When We Were Wolves"" it's the supremely
    American fear of faceless threats: ""And we run, and we hide, and we hid,
    and we ran/ And we hide in lightless rooms/ And we banged on our pianos.""
    Away from society, we take refuge in art. Catharsis keeps us sane.
    </p>
<p>
    Like the Decemberists, this band knows how to balance sweet arrangements and
    grim themes. ""Learning by Lego"" begins harmlessly enough, with
    harmonies flashing against gentle strums. Suddenly everything roars toward children's-choir
    anarchy à la <em>The Wall</em>, the jabs at fascism replaced by ominous, shouted
    nonsense like ""Pulling out my hair/ Crushed by plastic lego men."" 
    </p>
<p>
    No less disordered, the two halves of ""Wrongfully, I Rested"" yield
    the same mysterious dark-pretty tension. The first movement witnesses a boy
    pining for an unattainable dreamgirl, the second follows him home, only to
    stumble into a different nightmare: ""Hear him bang, hear him scream in the
    hallway/ Pray to God, he won't come my way."" The lead single ""Sister
    Sneaker, Sister Soul"" also riffs sinisterly on unrequited love. This
    tender orchestral number capsizes under one strange line: ""Hiding from the
    light that she brings with her/ Policies of the worst."" For this band,
    nothing is ever what it seems. An epic restatement of this suspicion, ""The
    Reputation of Ross Francis"" details a Ken Lay figure's stab at
    smooth-talking his way into heaven.
    </p>
<p>
    For all the love here, <em>Wolves</em> is about our generation's emotions du
    jour, doubt and fear, not only of color-coded national alerts, but of the
    smaller things: a father's angry yell, the intimidating beauty of a classmate,
    or the outside chance that change isn't just around the corner.

    a lot of ground in his multi-decade career as Momus.<span> </span>But whatever aesthetic predilection he's
    pursuing, one thing has always remained clear: Momus likes words.<span> </span>At times, Currie's musical creations have seemed
    like little more than backdrops for his clever and extensive verbiage.<span> </span>It's helped him forge a distinctive identity
    for himself, as both a musician and a writer, but it's also pigeonholed him as
    something of a novelty act.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""Nervous Heartbeat"", the debut single from Currie's 19th album as Momus, is notable not only for being the best song on <em>Ocky Milk</em>, but also for being one of the
    most minimal and restrained tracks ever to grace a Momus record.<span> </span>During each gradually ascending verse, Currie's
    vocals are electronically modulated in and out of tune. <span> </span>Here, he uses the digital to enact a <em>lack</em> of control; an interesting reversal
    upon close consideration, but a striking and strangely moving sound regardless.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Elsewhere, <em>Ocky Milk</em>
    ranges from solid to thoroughly unspectacular.<span>
</span>Currie no longer seems to be shooting for the relentless cheeky charm of
    his earlier releases, making <em>Ocky Milk</em>
    an uncertain understatement. <span> </span>Acoustic and electronic elements sit
    comfortably side by side, occasionally falling into interesting textural formations.<span> </span>The songs are a mixed bag; some are some
    goofy and old-timey, some are straightforwardly danceable, and a good many are
    aimless and meandering.<span> </span><em>Ocky Milk</em> is full of clever asides and
    cultural references, but more so than with most any other Momus reference,
    these often seem beside the point.
    </p><p>
    Which is probably a good thing; Currie has never had trouble
    making music that is well-put and cerebral. <span> </span>Even when he's singing about sex, there's not
    a lot of <em>body</em> in his work.<span> </span>Which is, perhaps, why I've always preferred
    his live shows to his recorded output; something about seeing this tall, lanky,
    eye patch-wearing Scotsman grasping a microphone and bleating out songs in the bondi
    blue glow of an iBook is instantly compelling.<span> </span>""Nervous Heartbeat"" is the first time I've heard a
    similar combination of digital sheen and human frailty actually make its way
    onto a Momus record, and it's exciting to hear some of Currie's
    high-concept concerns expressed so gracefully and musically.<span> </span>Currie has proven himself a talented writer
    and cultural commentator, and this album is expectedly clever and self-aware. <span> </span>But <em>Ocky
    Milk </em>suggests that Currie is still capable of surprising us with good,
    understated music.

    sounds as years and trends pass. Low couldn't have been more unlikely
    candidates for a lengthy career when they appeared in 1993,  but several years of their single-minded adherence to patience and grace was a welcome reaction to
    the louder, heavier music dominating the early 90s rock charts and airwaves. It's understandable if that sound defines the group for its dedicated fans; aside from personal attachment, it recalls a time when mediocre
    rock radio was all we had to rebel against.</p><p>
    But for Low, in 2007, there's so much more at stake. The title itself
    sounds like a call to arms, but the band has skirted the idea that <em>Drums and Guns</em> is a political record; most of its key lyrics are ambiguous
    enough to stand in for personal torment as well as social unrest.
    It's a little easier to assign the former to <em>Drums and Guns</em>, knowing that since <em>The Great Destroyer</em>
    (a critically divisive and uncharacteristic record for the band in its
    own right), Low lost their longtime bassist Zak Sally, and their
    frontman, Alan Sparhawk, has had a nervous breakdown, recorded a
    vocal-less solo record that's wildly experimental compared to Low, and
    spent a goodly chunk of time fronting the far more rock-oriented
    Retribution Gospel Choir (sometimes partnered with Red House Painters'
    Mark Kozelek).</p><p>
    Considering the mixed
    reception to the rocking <em>The </em><em>Great Destroyer</em>, you'd think the band would return to their signature sound. You'd be wrong.
    Hardcore fans have heard more than
    half of <em>Drums and Guns</em>' songs played in Retribution Gospel Choir's guitar-driven context (as well as the understated ""Dragonfly"" in the band's recent live sets, and ""Murderer"" from a rare 10"" single), and would assume these songs lean further in the
    direction of that side project and <em>Great Destroyer</em>; they'd be wrong as well.  <em>Drums and Guns</em>
    tears at these already road-tested
    songs, leaving them as nothing but spine and sinew, with only the barest traces of what
    made them Low in the first place-- namely, the fragile and beautiful
    two-part harmonies. A promo sticker came with this record, saying, ""I'm sick to  death of LOW."" It's easy to picture those words coming
    directly from Sparhawk.
    </p><p>
    But there's more career summation here than you'd think, from the nihilism and legacy-toying of <em>Great Destroyer</em>, to the brave production on their 
    <em>Songs for a Dead Pilot</em>  EP, to even weirder corners of the catalog: ""Belarus"" sounds like something from Low's oft-ignored remix record,
    with a lovely harmony that highlights Mimi Parker's vocals while simple bells,
    chimes and sampled strings burrow in the background-- enchanting, but about as far from Low as you can imagine. <em>Drums and Guns</em>  even bears influence from Sparhawk's recent 
    <em>Solo Guitar</em> record: ""Pretty
    People"" buzzes ominously, as Sparhawk wails some fairly
    obvious warnings before ending abruptly once a drum hits and a guitar
    chord sounds. ""Dragonfly"" has barely any instrumentation, just a
    clanging
    feedback loop; with its slow-burning swooning vocals about pills
    and shortened life cycles, it'd be a difficult song to tarnish in
    any cast. The track brings the same brutal chills of the highlights
    from <em>Trust</em>, but gets there only on the
    drama from Sparhawk's sour vocal turn and Parker's gentle
    accompaniment, and without the band's trademark perpetual reverb.
    </p>
<p>
    Mostly, the record is marked by a
    preponderance of basic, almost flimsy  drum loops. Oh my, are there
    loops on this record. Songs like ""Breaker"" build from a basic beat to nothing more than handclaps and a one-finger organ drones, with a
    pinched multi-tracked harmony from Sparhawk who laments ""our bodies
    break/ And the blood just spills and spills,"" and ""there's gotta be an
    end to that."" It's one of the most glaring examples on <em>Drums and Guns</em>
    of hard-panned vocals located almost entirely in the right
    channel, but after hearing the track enough times, it ceases to be a
    distraction, and it ends up one of the most striking examples of their
    stripped-down approach.
    </p>
<p>
    I doubt Low fans who've held on this long will
    rebel against these new textures, more the way they're employed-- the
    band has added an almost disconcerting levity, and subtracted the
    gentleness.
    The
    less said about the jaunty funk bass and busier loops of ""Always Fade""
    and ""Hatchet"" the better; the latter is at least a mid-record
    palette-cleanser. It's this mode of Low that's the hardest to get used
    to; they sounding less sparse and more glib and underdeveloped, lost in
    uncharted territory. Parker, thankfully more present here
    than on recent records, gets ""Dust on the Window"" to herself, and its
    dusky balladry is a high point in a difficult middle section. Sequencing does threaten to kill this record, though there's ropes
    to old fans and frustrated listeners later in the album. ""Take Your
    Time"" is a dip into the pathos of previous Low records, even using
    church bells to further dampen the dirge. Should this not be enough for alienated fans,
    try to take comfort in the <em>seven other albums that came before</em>. There's a point at which a consistent sound is no longer a
    virtue. ""Your Poison"" shows us what Low would sound like as Guided By
    Voices; we don't need it. Once you're approaching double digits in
    album output, your records should actually do something to change
    status quo and justify their release, or at the very least spark some
    shred of interest in new listeners with the band's back catalog.
    </p>
<p>
    Should those listeners make it to the re-recorded ""Murderer"", then <em>Drums and Guns</em>
    will have accomplished both. The original EP from which ""Murderer"" was
    taken was Low at their most stark and dramatic; this version stands up ably to the first (as opposed to the
    unfortunate recut of ""Silver Rider"" from <em>Great Destroyer</em>),
    adding an insistent 4/4 bass pulse as well as a subtle guitar loop that works as
    an effective earworm, and a martial drumbeat that underlines the lyrics
    and serves the album's theme. The same goosebumps arise as the
    lyrics move from creepy insinuation to a protagonist's sneering
    confrontation with his maker (""Don't act so innocent/ I've seen you
    pound your fist into the Earth/ And I've read your books""), though this
    time with a new, understated urgency instead of just straining
    melodrama.
    </p>
<p>
    Drums and Guns ends on ""Violent Past"", beginning with another
    particularly ambiguous lyric: ""All I can do is fight, even if I know
    you're right."" It could be a call to arms or a mantra for struggling
    with personal demons-- either way, it sounds almost futile among the
    organs that bleed distortion and clamoring percussion, with the lyrics
    pondering how we've come this far before deciding with a shrug, ""maybe
    it's your violent past."" You could call the whole of the album
    resigned, but it still sounds determinedly so, the voice of one band
    against the world-- not too far off from where Low started.

Even better news: It sounds even less like his early work. In one fell swoop, Pole-- Berlin studio mastermind and ~scape label proprietor Stefan Betke-- has slipped the yoke of early classics and mid-career questing alike, resulting in an album that brims with ideas and vitality but is utterly unique.<em></em></p><p>
    A quick recap. <em>Pole</em>-- Betke's fourth album, and his sole longplayer for Mute, after a long run with Germany's Kiff, which licensed his material to Matador in the U.S.-- marked a concerted effort by Stefan Betke to escape the omnipresent signature of <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, and <em>3</em>, the classic trilogy in which he proposed and perfected an idea of gurgling, crackling dub reductionism built of little more than sigh and suggestion. Flirting with hip-hop and a newly aerated sound, <em>Pole</em> succeeding in escaping what Mark Richardson, writing in Pitchfork, described as the ""cul de sac"" of the artist's calcifying style, but only at the expense of the kind of coherence and cohesion that had marked his efforts until that point. He had to try something, of course. The first three records were brilliant, dredging the sedimented floor of third-hand ideas of dub passed from sources like Seefeel's ""isolationist"" ambient music and Chain Reaction's shimmering ""heroin house""-- and running the sludge through a rickety pipeline of busted filters and loose wires. But no matter how much mica (and who knows, gold) flecked his gloriously gunky stuff, there were only so many ways he could take it: even the most astonishing builders of sand castles are, ultimately, constrained by their materials.</p><p>
<em>Steingarten</em> is still based upon dub reggae, from its loping rhythms to its revolving-door chord changes to traditional reggae staples like melodica and waxy analog delay. There's still plenty of fizz in the margins, too, though it no longer defines the shape of the songs. You can kinda sorta hear a glimmer of hip-hop in the opening cut, though thankfully there's no vocalist this time out, and two of the tracks here-- the back-to-back ""Düsseldorf"" and ""Jungs""-- absorb the ubiquitous tick-tocking of Berlin minimal techno. But despite a continuity of influence, the sound of Pole's production-- its very heft-- is completely and refreshingly new.
    </p><p>
    This time out, Pole has reconfigured his relationship with gravity. Where before the music felt held together (and sometimes held down) by the weight of history-- both the music's and the musician's-- and the massing sound itself, here the individual parts hang together easily, as if brought together by chance and left bobbing in each other's orbits. The music is full of empty space, though it's not the insistent absence of minimalism-- more like the languid silence between two lovers who know when speech is moot. You can hear it in the opening track, ""Warum"", where every instrument-- from the aerosol shaker to the handclaps that crack like coals burning low-- stakes out its space in the mix, ceding the middle ground to... well, to nothing at all, really. There's just a wide swathe of ground, inviting you to stand there, stretch out and touch the sounds around you. It's certainly one of the most welcoming approaches to mixing and mastering I've heard.
    </p>
<p>
    The other big update this time out is the addition of noise-- not the blasted scree of Merzbow but an agreeable skronk sourced from muted guitar feedback and weeping tremolo. From the tube-amp uprising caught on ""Winkelstreben"" to the way he hammers at the guitar strings pulled taut below the bridge, it sounds like Betke was listening to Sonic Youth's <em>Evol</em> while recording <em>Steingarten</em>. It would be appropriate if it were true, given that this album represents the most important evolution in Pole's career.
    </p>
<p>
    More than anything, <em>Steingarten</em> is a remarkably easy-going album. Like all great recordings, it opens up over time, yielding fresh discoveries with repeat listens, but it hardly guards its secrets. You can hear the simplest kind of joy in the way (in ""Düsseldorf"") a high-pitched, pinging note run through delay begins gradually to throb out of time with the rhythm track. The opposing shapes and textures in ""Winkelstreben"" create totally unexpected convergences-- improbable harmonies on a par with those found in the best abstract painting or Japanese fashion. Full of resonant, glistening, almost tangible sounds, <em>Steingarten</em> is a synaesthetic's dream; I find myself continually running up against the limits of my own descriptive powers in trying to tackle its pear-shaped bass drops, its corrugated ambient underpinnings, its frog-throated choruses.
    </p>
<p>
    By contemporary standards, this is a short album: nine songs, 45 minutes. It takes guts to hold oneself to such meager numbers after a four-year hiatus, but Betke got it absolutely right: there's not a note out of place on this thing, not a single thread of delay that overstays its welcome. <em>Steingarten</em> is a nearly perfect album. Putting the melancholic ""Pferd"" last is just another of the record's successes; it makes the whole thing feel like a kind of meditation on the very nature of limits and limitations. Given the history of his Pole project, that's likely something Betke has mulled over plenty. Here, with inscrutable agility-- like the mechanics of meditating upon a Zen koan-- he moots the whole issue and achieves something very much like a state of grace.

    The Indianapolis trio Odawas have never quite been configured like a typical rock band, and as a result it seems it may have taken them some extra time to determine an appropriate course of action. Their ambitious 2005 Jagjaguwar debut <em>The Aether Eater</em> found the group set rather adrift in a vast galaxy of possibilities, patching their frizzled control module with a jerry-rigged combination of campfire folk, interstellar art-rock, and loopy conceptual narratives. Eventful though the journey was, there was little to indicate what Odawas' ultimate destination might be, and certainly nothing to suggest the group to be capable of creating an album as focused and captivating as <em>Raven and the White Night</em>.</p><p>
    As befits a group who also credit their drummer Brad Cash with ""engineering and technique,"" <em>Raven and the White Night</em> is a stunning, balanced work of studio craft and orchestration. The Odawas' sound still travels primarily between the dual poles of singer-guitarist Michael Tapscott and the vintage keyboards and electronics of Isaac Edwards, but here the group's personalities are unified with an uncommon degree of poise and cultivation. The album's warmth and sleepy grace-- which can frequently invoke Grizzly Bear's recent <em>Yellow House</em>, as well as the requisite Neil Young echoes-- also benefit from Tapscott's decision to eliminate (or at least minimize) some of the more excessive lyrical contrivances that often proved so distracting on <em>The Aether Eater</em>.</p><p>
    Which is not to say that the group has entirely lost its taste for extravagant pomp and circumstance. ""The Maddening of Raven"" opens the album with a portentous flourish of piano, creepshow organ, and tympani that seems conceived somewhere between an Angelo Badalamenti soundtrack and Verdi's <em>Requiem</em>. This indulgent bit of grandeur out of the way, Odawas are then free to immerse themselves into <em>Raven and the White Night's</em> beckoning narcotic currents. On such tracks as ""Circus Song"" and the majestic ""Getting to Another Plane"" Tapscott's vocals and guitar are sculpted in reverb and echo, while Edwards displays surprising restraint on the keyboards, his stately contributions casting the songs with a faint but unmistakable air of sorrow and faded opulence. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album reaches its melodic and emotive apex on the gorgeous single ""Alleluia"", a cautious hymn whose somber strains of piano and funereal drums serve to escort Tapscott's muted, wordless chorus as it whistles past the graveyard. Despite this brief, hesitant respite, however, the album's prevailing mood is grim and paranoid, borne out in such foreboding tracks as ""When God Was a Wicked Kid"" or the self-explanatory ""Beware"", which matches Edwards' swirling, ambient drones and the backing vocals of Liz Janes to its fervent cautions of a faceless dread.

<p>
    Over the course of <em>Raven and the White Night</em> this hermetic, claustrophobic atmosphere becomes so pervasive that each of Odawas' more alien instrumental departures can seem like a crucial burst of fresh oxygen, such as on the extended electric guitar meltdown of ""Barnacles and Rustic Debris"" or within the strange marimba tones and field recordings on ""Love Is (The Only Weapon With Which I Got to Fight)"". On <em>The Aether Eater</em> these unexpected discursions might have seemed just another instance of Odawas trying to establish a distinctive sound through sheer force of will. Here, however, they appear to be simply expressive accents, the natural spoils of a group who is suddenly operating at newfound levels of confidence, cohesion, and off-handed brilliance.

    Faceless Norwegian composer Erik K. Skodvin, aka Svarte Greiner, stuffs circuit boards with ghosts. Fittingly, promo photos find him (or someone or something) in fluttering, disembodied blond Slash mode. His debut full-length, <em>Knive</em>, hums with a romantic, bleak, and morose melancholia-- something both emotionally <em>and</em> sonically heavy. <br/></p><p>
    Skodvin, who also records as one half of Deaf Center, here makes more enigmatic tracks, the work of a lone musician at his peek-a-boo best. You can locate the album in the electronic section, but the <em>feel </em>is more organic, reminiscent of, say, <em>Gleipnirs Smeder</em> by Gorgoroth-affiliated duo Jotunspor, only emptied of its rock flesh and slowed to a frigid, levitating death rattle.</p><p>
    There's never any screaming or howling-- the sinister part is what doesn't happen. <em>Knive</em> comes alive largely because of its spaciousness, but also the fact that the knob turning's mixed with field recordings (a crow caw, a rouge kettle, door or boat creaking), baying male vocal whooshes/a frosty operatic female singer, cello, pipe organ, arid sounding bass, guitar, and singing saw. It accrues momentum and gains force through interlocking puzzle chunks. Music's referred to as ""shadowy"" far too often; this sounds like shades and shadows making a mute racket. 
    </p>
<p>
    Each track's on a slow-repeat loop. The pieces then extend this sort of motion, an ebb and flow that works its way into song titles like ""Ocean Out of Wood"" and ""The Boat Was My Friend"". The pattern shuffles through subtle additions: Freddy Krueger blades clinking together in ""Easy on the Bones"", the more defined organ-""driven"" ""The Black Dress"" (along with crinkling papers and shuffling and other incidentals), heartier, almost rock drums in ""The Dining Table"". Otherwise, there are no obvious or dance-ready beats-- you get the constant feel of a presence; a heart moving faintly... end-times biorhythms. <em>Knive</em> escapes easy crescendos-- the record just moves continuously to a non-finale.</p><p>
    Mr. Skodvin's wild ride came out a few months ago. It made my 2006 year-end list, but somehow I never wrote about it except in passing. I'm glad for the delay-- months later, after dozens of listens, it's still a mystery. The musician's biography's known, but to me, his physical presence isn't. Some time ago, a person wrote with his info and wanted us to get in contact. I ignored the invitation, not out of malice, but because <em>Knive</em> exists so much more powerfully with nothing tangible attached to it. For now, it could very well have been written by the void. Feels best to keep it that way.

    Múm were the right band at the right time when their Icelandic debut <em>Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK </em>found its way to
    the States in early 2001. Both Boards of Canada and the Aphex Twin were on
    extended holiday, but the melodic machine music they'd brought to the 1990s was everywhere; while IDM had already begun to spill over into indie
    pop, the particulars of the merger were still taking shape. Meanwhile, Sigur
    Rós had recently sent notice that there was more to Icelandic music than Björk,
    so people were looking for the island's next band. No surprise, then, that a
    pop-leaning collective from Reykjavík that married cut-up beats to warm synths
    and trad instruments like accordion and trumpet sounded appealing. And it didn't
    hurt that two of their members were attractive women-- twins-- who had already
    appeared on the cover of Belle &amp; Sebastian's <em>Fold Your Hands Child, You
    Walk Like a Peasant</em>.</p><p>
    None of which is to minimize the impact of their first
    record, which I still sounds great. It's the highlight of
    their catalog because it's mostly instrumental; the soft, high-pitched coo of
    the Kristín Valtýsdóttir would soon become the group's defining feature, to the
    band's detriment. Her vocal style certainly has its fans-- see the many guest
    spots and collaborations she's been involved with since-- but I find her
    treacly girl-child persona tolerable only in small doses. Which is what this
    brief <em>Peel Session</em> EP delivers: recorded in 2002, three of the four tracks
    are drawn from the debut.</p><p>
    Radio sessions from bands reliant on sequencers can be
    a dodgy proposition. Autechre managed a couple of interesting EPs by building
    and re-building tracks from scratch; Boards of Canada, on the other hand,
    typically re-created their studio records down to the letter. There are
    noticeable tweaks to the originals, but it's questionable how much they
    add to the work. The opening track does an interesting job melding a hopped-up
    version of the debut's ""Slow Bicycle"" (re-titled ""Broken
    Bicycle"") and combining it with ""Smell Memory"". The latter
    suffers little for the absence of its usual build-up, jumping immediately to
    the memorable synth line that clatters like a copper music box with 120 volts
    running through it. The primary backing track on the cuddly video game-inspired
    ""Awake on a Train"" appears to be just a playback of the original, but
    the guitar work is obviously live and put in the foreground to positive effect.
    The doomy ""Now There Is that Fear Again"" is enhanced by a thicker
    accordion sound, and the live hand percussion blends well with a sequenced
    glitch that serves as a metronome. Closing ""The Ballad of the Broken
    String"" uses almost no electronics and is the thick accordion drone is
    satisfying. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, nice as it sounds, and essential as it may be
    for fans, it's unclear exactly what the point of <em>Peel Sessions </em>is. The
    songs are shorter, the live sound can be a bit thicker, and we get an idea of
    how Múm worked live. It's a decent sampler of Múm drawn from their most interesting
    time, but ultimately there's little reason to reach for this over their debut.
    These songs benefit from the more drawn-out approach of the studio record; when
    I hear <em>Yesterday's </em>""I'm 9 Today"", I'm ready for another hour
    from this band.

Their sophomore effort seems too indebted and stifled in retrospect, while their debut feels more like guiltless, gleeful re-appropriation and unrepentant bright-lights aspiration, and has since become the band's albatross to try and improve upon. That hasn't changed with the band's third effort (and first for Matador), <em>Turn the Lights Out</em>, but some other things have: It appears that when second guitarist Ian Adams left the band after their second album, the cleaner, post-punk Britishisms went with him. <em>Turn the Lights Out</em> is also the band's first record with fellow Chicagoan Brian Case, formerly of 90 Day Men, and while it may be more consistent than <em>Laced with Romance</em>, it's admittedly maybe half as fun. It doesn't quite have the delightfully snide semi-reverence of the debut, but it's a step closer to it, and possibly a step closer to the Ponys finding an identity of their own.</p><p>
    Not that there's isn't the shadow of influence here. Case is a good fit for the band and a subtle accompanist most of the time, but he's the key ingredient to covering <em>Turn the Lights Out</em> with familiar haze, making the guitars all sound like Sonic Youth Lite-- all cool guitar tone, none of the unpredictable noise jams. There's an audience out there who'd love to hear a Sonic Youth record without all of that (maybe some of them even bought <em>Rather Ripped</em>), one who might tune into <em>Turn the Lights Out</em>. It helps that the Ponys stay consistent with it, incorporating that mighty echo throughout most tracks, with just a few exceptions: The embarrassing, organ-baked title track or the slick jangle of ""1209 Seminary"".</p><p>
    What they can still do is write an opening track that overshadows the rest of the album. Just as it was with ""Let's Kill Ourselves"" or ""Glass Conversation"" before it, nothing on <em>Turn the Lights Out</em> quite reaches the heights of ""Double Vision"". It's a seemingly simple song that's nonetheless hard to pin down, shifting subtly as soon you want to label it. It builds like a jam-session skeleton, with a sleepy drumbeat and a modest strut of a bassline while singer Jered Gummere coos like Thurston Moore over more wavering guitar echo than notes. Big, staccato chords and insistent bellowing follows, then paint-peeling fretwork and that damned bassline again. Hard to complain about frontloading with a track that plays hard-to-get so well, but luckily there's reason to keep going: ""Small Talk"" is a bubbling lament that floats by with a tender vocal and the barest touches of guitar, letting the busy rhythm section carry the aching melody. ""Shine"" starts as a sluggish two-chord lighter-lifting anthem, but soon becomes three different sluggish, yet effective, anthems over the course of its four minutes. ""Kingdom of Hearts"" is the candy-cigarette exhale of satisfaction from the record's strong first side, a sweetly melodic slow burn of narcotic strumming and a shuffling beat where Gummere's detached vocals suit the track perfectly.
    </p><p>
    ""Poser Psychotic"" apes SY the hardest but manages to imitate the slow, inexorable builds of <em>Dirty</em> as well as its guitar tone, and its momentum carries through to the final moments of the album. They've written a fine batch of songs that serve the new sound well; I just wish it were the other way around for once. The Ponys make good records, and <em>Turn the Lights Out</em> is no exception, but I'm still waiting on the great one I've always felt they'd had in them-- one that delivers on the promise of their debut, and reminds you why you pulled out their record ahead of all those whose shoulders they've stood on.

<em>Songs For the Young at Heart</em>, compiled by Tindersticks'
    Stuart Staples and David Boulter, is the third attempt in the last couple of
    years to imagine a new kind of children's record. First out of the traps were
    St. Etienne, who released the <em>Up the Wooden Hills</em> as a bonus EP with 2005's <em>Tales
    From Turnpike House</em>. Then last year, Mick Cooke and Richard Colburn from Belle and Sebastian
    curated the fundraising compilation<em> Colours Are Brighter</em>, featuring Franz
    Ferdinand, Snow Patrol, and Flaming Lips.</p><p>
    All three offer distant echoes of UK indie
    pop's mid-80s revolt into innocence-- a generation of musicians who grew up
    with anoraks, fanzines, and flexi-discs wondering what kind of music to play to
    the kids of their own. As such, the differences between the records' peculiar
    romances of childhood are intriguing. St. Etienne imagined a psychedelic
    dayglo bubblefunk answer to Sesame Street's counting songs and alphabets. Belle
    and Sebastian and friends conjured up a peculiar Saturday morning jamboree-- equal parts Roald Dahl, A.A. Milne, and Craig McCracken.</p><p>
    But Staples and Boulter's record may be the most appealing-- to
    grown-ups at any rate. It certainly has the most heartfelt, singular vision, and
    it's the most profoundly, unashamedly nostalgic. It draws
    almost exclusively upon what Brits of a certain age know as the golden age of
    kids telly, from the mid-60s until the mid-80s, when the goggle box was no
    longer an alien presence in the UK living room, and not quite a ruthless
    marketing machine. ""The Magic Roundabout"", ""Mary, Mungo and Midge"", ""Robinson
    Crusoe""... to some of us the titles alone are enough to have us careering aboard a
    Proustian rush back to 1973. In fact, the inescapable charm of the material has
    long been the stuff of tired observational comedy. And listening to covers of
    these old themes, rather than the versions polished smooth by familiarity and
    the fondness of memory, is not always a happy experience.
    </p>
<p>
    Former Catatonia singer Cerys Matthews makes
    a game attempt at ""Jacky""'s ""White Horses"", but the original is such a
    delicately limpid dream of a song it really shouldn't have been messed with,
    and the synthesized brass only breaks the spell. And even Staples' sweetly
    crooned version of ""Hushabye Mountain"" is inevitably overshadowed by Bobbie
    Gentry-- or even Dick Van Dyke. The record is on surer ground with some avuncular cameos:
    Jarvis Cocker deadpans through Stanley Holloway's tale of ""The Lion and Albert"",
    Kurt Wagner is perfectly cast on ""Inch Worm"", Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy croaks
    through ""Puff the Magic Dragon"", while the Go-Betweens' Robert Forster is convincingly creepy on
    ""Uncle Sigmund's Clockwork Storybook"": ""Did you know that smiling in your sleep/ Means there's secrets that you keep/ Locked in boxes in your head / Wise
    men find them when you're dead"".
    </p>
<p>
    So many of these songs have a dark undertow, epitomized by
    Stuart Murdoch on ""Florence's Sad Song"", from ""The Magic Roundabout"", forlornly
    wondering ""Shall we ever feel the sun again? Will the games we play end here?""
    As a record for children you can only imagine it must be a colossal downer (my
    own research, incidentally, suggests that Fisher-Price Aphex Twin dementia of
    the UK/Norwegian duo Toy is a more surefire hit with the under-fives). But once
    you realize that it's actually intended for terminally melancholic adults,
    things become clearer: Its natural home is the saloon rather than the
    nursery. It's
    a fine line between boozy sentimentality and the excruciating apprehension of
    your own loss of innocence, but the record really hits the mark on the one
    original song here, the closing ""Hey, Don't You Cry"", sighed by Staples over a
    simple acoustic guitar, building with glockenspiel and strings. ""Everywhere you
    go, there are lines to follow"" he mutters. ""You know it's no race, some people
    shine for such a short time and then spend their days dreaming of that time.""
    He's singing a lullaby, but it's to stop himself from crying.

    Cry for help? Come-on? Exactly how much heavy breathing does Portland,
    Oregon have in it? My favorite record of the last year, the Blow's <em>Paper
    Television</em>, was all sexed-up frustration, or frustration sexed-up:
    performance art by way of crippling, demented, and public sexual insecurities.
    Portland has probably the best DIY scene in the country, talented and clever
    musicians, the labels to collaborate, and they're <em>all in bands by themselves</em>.
    On a stage, they are alone; in the studio, pairs at the most. Do they even
    realize the guy next door is making the exact same sweaty complaint into the
    exact same laptop-- that theirs are problems that could be solved together?</p><p>
    Enter Panther, né Charlie Salas-Humara: lousy video breakdancer (catch him
    in the video for The Thermals ""Pillar of Salt"" and in clips for his
    own songs), Justin Timberlake/Prince worshipper, and sex-jam crooner. <em>Secret
    Lawns</em>, his debut album, is his scene's basic synthesis: Bobby Birdman's
    lounge-act croon, YACHT's rap-radio obsession, E*Rock's basement boombox beats,
    White Rainbow's laptop freak-out, the Blow's autoerotic romance, reduced to
    something as spare and sharp as the snap music ""How Does it Feel?"" rips
    off.</p><p>
    I mean, the video for ""You Don't Want Your Nails Done"" is Panther
    dancing, tearing around a tiny cardboard room: cardboard cell phone, cardboard
    iPod, cardboard electrical outlet. Is there a better metaphor for
    Salas-Humara's grind, or Portland's collective grind, than the re-creation of
    the familiar in miniature, rebuilt to look similar but work totally differently,
    or not at all?</p><p>
    Hapless redundancy as expressive art: his opener is called ""Use Your Mouth to Breathe"" and it's Casio-thump by way of a falsetto ""ooooh"" and
    a plea-- ""You've got to misunderstaaand."" Closer ""Tiger's
    Touch"" is a similar scheme, built twice as complex. The heaviness is real,
    with a theremin-synth laser show and a fuzzy string-swell coda, but the
    sentiment doesn't move far at all past the intro: ""Don't touch me baby/
    You know I've got issues/ I've never been touched/ Never before/ Sit on the
    couch/ But not next to me."" Sex is everywhere but where he wants it.</p><p>
    Take soul jams like the Michael Jackson-channeling ""Telephone Wire"",
    where he abandons his budget-priced retro r&amp;b to use voice as instrument,
    and slow-crooner ""Talk for Tuesday"", which forgets itself halfway
    through like a broken merry-go-round, and add them to the unconfident-confident
    Timberlake dance tracks, and you get the cardboard version of <em>FutureSex/LoveSounds</em>,
    minus Timbaland and the talent. No knock there. </p><p>
    Those hung up on whether or not Charlie is serious about the whole thing
    probably should catch the next flight to Portland, where people don't have to
    answer that question because no one around asks it. If the whole album was
    ""Tigers Touch"", no one would outside the city either. But Panther's
    DIY cuts both ways: <em>Secret Lawns</em> is probably about 60% finished. It's
    anchored at the beginning, end, and middle, and floating free and indistinct
    throughout.  Which makes it more
    suitable in small, frustration-charged doses than as a whole meal. Which, by
    the way, Oregonians out there, is still possible-- you can eat the cake and
    make music about eating the cake, not just about wanting to eat cake all the
    time. Gotta be a musician out there for everybody, right?

    It's all here-- the full spectrum of dumbstruck teenage
    L-U-V. Tough love. Unrequited love. Romantic love. Misguided love. Religious
    love. Selfish love. The love that doesn't come for free but is priceless-- all
    of it. When Buffalo natives Bobby Nunn and Eugene Coplin recorded <em>If This
    World Were Mine...</em> in the late 1960s and early 70s, the duo fashioned
    themselves as suave sophisticates with their insides exposed-- boys to men
    by-way-of Marvin Gaye and the Five Stairsteps. No doubt they incited more than
    a few swoons and sighs at local gigs. But then Nunn's father William couldn't
    sustain his fledgling label, Mo Do, and Bob &amp; Gene's album was set aside in
    a crawl space or an attic or wherever else all these ""lost"" soul
    records marinate. You can guess the rest: Collector-historian finds an old
    B&amp;G 45, makes a few calls, dusts off a few canisters and the thing finally
    sees fine record stores courtesy of hip Brooklyn nostalgists Daptone 36 years
    after recording wrapped. And make no mistake, this album is a time capsule;
    eternal sentiments caught in a refreshing-- but not necessarily fresh--
    package.</p><p>
    What sets <em>World</em> apart from other golden soul
    relics is its unexpected album-ness and its amateurish naiveté. Though the LP
    could be taken as a no-budget mirror of Motown's more tender sides, its hissy
    imperfections build a uniquely convincing narrative of conflicting hormones and
    emotions as they prep for maturity. As Buffalo outsiders, B&amp;G didn't have
    to compete with artists vying for showtime and the lax approach to shows-- for
    better and worse. Even after going through the digital wringer, <em>World</em>
    still sounds like it was just recorded in Bobby's house after school. There are
    a few vocal flubs that wouldn't survive cursory <em>American Idol</em> judgment,
    some perilously loose instrumentation, and varying degrees of sound quality
    throughout. But turn a blind eye to the blemishes, and the album settles into a
    wafting drama of young love that floats above generation gaps, remastering
    technologies, and stylistic innovations.</p><p>
<em>If This World Were Mine...</em> follows a storyline countless teen movies
    have exploited in the years since its recording: Boy dreams about getting
    fantasy girl back, boy changes his demeanor for fantasy girl, boy turns to the
    Lord to help him get fantasy girl back, boy finally gets fantasy girl, boy gets
    bored with fantasy girl, boy brushes off fantasy girl, boy finally comes to
    terms with love's fickle touch with the help of a Marvin Gaye &amp; Tammi
    Terrell classic. (OK, maybe not <em>countless</em> teen movies, but a
    couple-- probably.) Along the way, the pair shade their typical ""I want you
    back"" sentiments with more intriguing, detailed relationship struggles.
    While ""I Can Be Cool"" is marred by a couple glaring vocal gaffes, its
    tale of ""but I can change!"" desperation is tragic and affecting.
    ""I know you dig the kind of dude that... spends more time doing you wrong
    than keeping your love true and strong/ But if that's what it takes to get you
    baby, I can be cool,"" it goes, and the sensitive duo's complete
    unbelievability as a pair of tough playboys only adds to its heart-tugging doom.
    And the decision at the center of ""Which Love"" isn't between two
    lovely ladies; skillfully ambiguous lines like ""I don't want to hurt
    you baby, I don't want to put you down/ The answer to my prayers I haven't yet
    found"" show the boys are trying to choose between God and a girl-- always
    a tough call. 
    </p>
<p>
    Unsurprisingly, the legendary Gaye &amp; Terrell title
    track-- the only song on the disc not penned by B&amp;G-- is also the album's
    unequivocal apex. But B&amp;G don't just copy Marvin outright, they add their
    own spin to ""If This World Were Mine..."" while incorporating a wispy
    extended instrumental intro. Taken out of its original male-female context, the
    song becomes dreamier with the duo singing their fairy-tale lullaby to a
    creature that may or may not exist. Like all of <em>World</em>, it's blindly,
    almost stupidly hopeful in its love-conquers-all thrust. Without the wear and
    cynicism of adulthood-- or most of the last four decades-- bogging them down,
    B&amp;G's insular world of skipped heartbeats and wide-eyed sincerity resonates

    With their Adelaide address, bong-rattling basslines,
    occasionally mystical lyrical tendencies, and, of course, lupine-derived
    moniker, Wolf and Cub will draw comparisons to fellow Aussie metalheads
    Wolfmother. And while the band's first full-length <em>Vessels</em> certainly
    betrays a shared unironic affinity for the stoner-metal triumvirate of Blue
    Cheer, Black Sabbath and Vanilla Fudge, Wolf and Cub more often than not
    engage in a different sort of role-play.</p><p>
    The nearly seven-minute title track that opens <em>Vessels</em>
    effectively sets the stage for the remainder of the record. Swirling guitar
    feedback and bass that rumbles like an underground explosion hover around
    primevally pounded drums, tambourine, and the vocals of Joel Byrne, who sounds
    like a pained Marc Bolan struggling to make sense of his surroundings. If this
    description conjures Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, it should. Like their San
    Francisco-based brothers in arms, Wolf and Cub are indebted to an imagined
    version of 1960s West Coast hippie mysticism. More specifically, the group
    seems to have walked through the looking glass of a 1968 Bill Graham Fillmore
    West concert poster and have yet to re-emerge.</p><p>
<em>Vessels</em> is loaded with revved-up, thunderous yowls that would make a
    fine soundtrack for any number of D&amp;D-inspired video games; sweat-soaked
    instrumental ""Rozalia Bizarre"" echoes the Amboy Dukes' 1968 B-movie
    rumble ""Journey to the Center of Your Mind"", while ""March of
    Clouds"", ""This Mess"", and ""Seeds of Doubt"" nail down
    the band's mind-numbing pattern of power drill psych-metal. That the songs are
    essentially interchangeable 8-cylinder rawk is one thing; that they begin to
    clearly resemble the long-forgotten, acid-coated Eastern-revivalists Kula
    Shaker is something more distressing altogether. A generic lavender haze coats
    much of <em>Vessels</em>, and the band seems fine to reside in the same exotic
    sky castle as the Brit Pop casualty.</p><p>
    A brief hint of better things to come for the band lies late in the record, as
    shape-shifting instrumental ""Conundrum"" suggests the band has a fuzzy
    idea of something more interesting to do with psychedelic atmospherics. A
    sinuous, dark piano line writhes its way through the howling feedback,
    suggesting a jazzy, mysterious undercurrent not too dissimilar from Traffic's
    ""The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys"". That song's title and
    preternatural level of mellowness invokes a spirit of fashionable-yet-casual
    rebelliousness that is perhaps impossible to realize, yet one that Wolf and Cub
    might do well to strive toward.

    There are few lonelier sounds than a Neil Young solo performance.  Most pictures from his solitary jaunts show him surrounded by an army of guitars or hunched over a piano, trapped in the middle of a stark spotlight.  Singing in a hushed and fragile voice, it almost sounds like he's locked in a bedroom rather than on a theater stage, and as such it's jarring to hear the rapt-silent crowd explode into applause between songs.  Even the material speaks to solitude, as Young dusts off the corner of his songbook concerned with aging and the search for companionship, topics better suited for early-morning insomniac worry, not public performance.</p><p>
<em>Live at Massey Hall</em>, the second live release in Neil Young's long-awaited and now briskly-paced Archives series, shows that this aspect of Young's persona had already matured in 1971, when the singer was only 26.  Coming on the heels of last year's <em>Live at Fillmore East</em>, a disc of barnstorming distortion-pedal epics with his preferred partners Crazy Horse, this birthplace performance is representative of the abrupt downshifts that have marked Young's career.  In the two years prior, he had released his loudest record to date, <em>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</em>, and participated in mega-ultra-supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, so of course the next step according to Neil Logic was to put the amps in storage and road-test an acoustic one-man show.</p><p>
    The January 1971 tour fell between Young's <em>After the Gold Rush</em> album, where his folk origins had started to seep back in amidst the overdrive of songs like ""Southern Man"", and 1972's <em>Harvest</em>, the warm country-rock crossover that won him his greatest commercial success.  Many of the <em>Harvest</em> songs show up in this set still dripping from their compositional birth, and, stripped of their eventual Nashville pageantry, they're surprisingly morose.  Without its plucky banjo and Linda Ronstadt/James Taylor backing vocals, ""Old Man"" shows itself to be more about the horror of growing old alone than country comfort, and the eventual mega-hit ""Heart of Gold"" is tossed off as the bridge to a stripped-bare version of ""A Man Needs a Maid"", one of Young's most painfully misanthropic songs.
    </p>
<p>
    Other new songs are no less glum, but make a case for Young as an underappreciated piano player.  ""Love in Mind"", a minor-key lament from the criminally out-of-print <em>Time Fades Away</em>, is a hangover valentine that's teasingly short, while ""See the Sky About to Rain"", stripped down from its Rhodes-heavy <em>On the Beach</em> version, reveals itself as a neglected gem, featuring surprisingly complex key-tickling.  Two songs that never made it to record show up as well, the mournful country tune ""Bad Fog of Loneliness"" (see what I mean?) and the silly throwaway ""Dance, Dance, Dance"", which appears to serve largely as a cheer-up send-off for Young's Toronto audience.  
    </p>
<p>
    One of the strengths of Young's acoustic sets is that they carry a distinct identity from his electric work; they're not merely ""unplugged"" versions of his high-volume catalog, but a completely different mood designed to emphasize his wounded nasal voice and delicate finger-picking.  Even so, the highlights of this particular set come from reinterpretations of electric hits, such as the reprises of <em>Fillmore East</em> showstoppers ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down By the River"" recast as chilling murder ballads.  The most effective makeover is given to the sometimes-maligned ""Ohio"", which in solo form (without the histrionics of CSNY's version) is less an angry screed than a perfect and still-relevant encapsulation of political helplessness, all half-finished thoughts and pervasive sadness.
    </p>
<p>
    All this gloom and doom was only going to build for Neil Young over the years following this tour; his new ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" foreshadowed the ensuing half-decade of addiction and death that would inspire some of his finest records.  <em>Live at Massey Hall</em> catches Young divining that bleak future from the darkness of the crowd, caught alone at the microphone, a chilling example of why he was, in this particular guise, the 70s' best architect of lonesomeness.

    It's telling that Stax Records was located in an old theatre.
    The music made at 926 E. McLemore Avenue
    in Memphis, Tennessee,
    emphasized soulful performance above pop poise, with the sweaty spontaneity of
    the moment always underscoring the intensity of romantic, social, sexual, or
    musical needs. On the new, 2xCD <em>Stax 50th
    Anniversary Celebration</em>, you can hear this unscripted quality in Isaac
    Hayes punctuating a verse of Bacharach and David's ""Walk on By"" with ""you
    socked it to me, mama!"" or for Mavis Staples singing along with the guitar solo
    on ""If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)"". It's impossible to imagine Rufus Thomas
    writing down any lyrics to ""Walking the Dog"" and ""Do the Funky Chicken"", two of
    his best novelty dance songs. Linda Lyndell even made up the verses to ""What a
    Man"" on the spot, improvising lyrics almost as she sang them.</p><p>
    Nearly all of the label's early songs were recorded live in that converted theatre studio, a practice
    born out of necessity rather than aesthetic principle but which nevertheless
    emphasized the latter. In fact, the label, which was founded in 1957 by former
    country musician Jim Stewart (ST) and his sister Estelle Axton (AX), kept
    things in-house, so Stax refers not just to the label and its snapping-fingers
    logo, but also the studio itself and the musicians who congregated there.
    Booker T. &amp; the MG's, the house band, typically played on most early tracks,
    occasionally with Isaac Hayes on organ or piano and the Mar-Keys providing
    those readily identifiable Memphis
    horns (the group's key players would later become known as the Memphis Horns).
    Hayes, from nearby Covington, Tennesse, and Memphian David Porter teamed up to
    write many of the label's best-known songs, like Sam &amp; Dave's ""Soul Man""
    and ""When Something Is Wrong with My Baby"" (the latter criminally omitted from
    this set). Together, all the musicians kept the songs preternaturally tight and
    targeted, with no fills or showboating, just pure, chugging r&amp;b momentum
    that is almost businesslike in its precision. As the label developed its sound
    and its studio, bringing in professional composers and arrangers during the
    early 1970s, this dynamic all but disappeared, but songs like Jean Knight's
    ""Mr. Big Stuff"", Mel &amp; Tim's ""Starting All Over Again"", and Hayes'
    decade-defining ""Theme from <em>Shaft</em>""
    prove that the label's musical standard remained high.</p><p>
    The practice of recording live in the studio, often with all
    the musicians gathered around only one mic, captured the performers' group
    dynamic along with wrong notes, missed cues, and other enlivening mistakes that
    reveal the studio's technical primitiveness. This might explain the absence
    from <em>Stax 50th</em> of Otis Redding's
    iconic ""Try a Little Tenderness"", whose big finale falls away as the horns fail
    to complete their crescendo-- surely a production error. Also missing is Albert
    King's ""Crosscut Saw"", a rumbling blues number with vocals buried low in the
    mix. However, these imperfections make those songs sound even more raw and
    urgent forty years later, the creations of real musicians in a real studio.
    Furthermore, the four-minute single version of Isaac Hayes' stellar ""Walk on
    By"" included here is a mere trophy compared to the towering monument of the
    twelve-minute version, and anyone familiar with Hayes' breakthrough 1969 album <em>Hot Buttered Soul </em>will be able to pick
    out the splices. The list of noticeable omissions is long: Hayes' ""Do Your
    Thing"", Sam &amp; Dave's ""Wrap It Up"" or ""I Thank You"", Redding's ""Hard to
    Handle"", and on and on and on.
    </p>
<p>
    Happily,<em> Stax 50th</em>
    gets more things right than wrong. The tracklist is commendable, with choice
    cuts from Sam &amp; Dave, the Mar-Keys, Eddie Floyd, the Staple Singers, Soul
    Children, and Jean Knight, showcasing the label's range as well as its musical
    and technological development over the years. Johnnie Taylor's ""Jody's Got Your
    Girl and Gone"", with its inverted call-and-response chorus, may be channeling
    Curtis Mayfield, but that doesn't dilute its double indictment of men who don't
    take care of their women and men who take others' women. Likewise, the Staple
    Singers' ""If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)"" may be a rewrite of their hit
    ""I'll Take You There"", but that doesn't make it any less transcendent. Too bad
    it's followed by Taylor's ""Cheaper
    to Keep Her"", a gimmick track that sounds the comp's only sour note. But bad
    transitions are a consequence of chronological sequencing; ultimately, this set
    contains one incredible song after another: the Bar-Kays' effervescent
    ""Soulfinger"", Albert King's doom-boogie ""Born Under a Bad Sign"", Booker T.
    &amp; the MG's percolating ""Time Is Tight"", Soul Children's heartbreakingly
    resigned ""I'll Be the Other Woman"", and forty-six more. 
    </p>
<p>
    Overextended even considering its string of hits, Stax
    closed in 1976 under the weight of accumulating debt, and the historic building
    on McLemore Avenue was eventually demolished, an act long considered indicative
    of the city's misplaced cultural priorities. Despite this tragic end, <em>Stax 50th</em> sounds utterly triumphant-- and
    why shouldn't it? A few years after the founding of the Stax Museum of American
    Soul Music on the studio's original site, the label has been revived in
    conjunction with the Concord Music Group, and has already signed Angie Stone,
    Soulive, and, best of all, Isaac Hayes. They'll have a large legacy to live up
    to: The 50 tracks on <em>Stax 50th</em> are
    merely a fraction of the label's amazing output, making this a fine
    introduction and hopefully a gateway for many listeners into its massive
    catalog.

    Like a crocus peeking through late-February snow, Catherine
    Howe's voice emerges tentatively from beneath the lavish orchestration of <em>What a Beautiful Place,</em> her long-lost
    debut album. For nearly 40 minutes and 10 songs, she must contend with an
    armory of strings, horns, woodwinds, timpani, bells, whistles, and piano that move with fluttery energy, suggesting an album bursting with ideas
    and fearing stillness. Occasionally, the woman at its center sounds
    overwhelmed, but Howe strikes me as too precocious and self-confident to let
    herself be upstaged. So it's possible that this dynamic between singer and
    arrangements is intended as metaphorical, evoking a young adult awed by the
    beauty and bustle of the world.</p><p>
    That would make sense: Howe was 20 years old in 1971, the year <em>What a Beautiful Place</em> was released, yet she comes across not as older or younger, but surprisingly
    ageless, as if she could be singing these songs at any time in her life.
    Nevertheless, this work is most certainly a product of its time, which gives
    the Numero Group's typically top-notch reissue the feeling of a time capsule. On
    songs like ""On a Misty Morning"" and ""My Child"", the florid production, courtesy
    of nomadic musician Bobby Scott (who collaborated with a range of artists, from
    the Hollies to Louis Prima) and featuring the London Symphony orchestra, stems
    from the hippie folk of the previous decade.</p><p>
    The album's strong sense of artistic purpose, evident in the
    spoken-word passages that now sound like yesterday's pretensions, grows from
    the same creative soil that cultivated Donovan's flights of nearly unbearable
    fancy and Vashti Bunyan's <em>Just Another Diamond
    Day</em>. Howe doesn't have Bunyan's sense of graceful melody or playful lyrical
    voice, but the two albums sound similarly earthy. ""Up North"", which starts the
    album after a brief prologue, paints a bleary but evocative picture of Howe's
    native Halifax, ""where the people smile their grimy smiles."" The songs that
    follow trail her to England, where she wrote most of the album. That sense of
    place, all the more beautiful compared to urban Canada,
    instills the music with a strong meditative quality at odds with Scott's
    arrangements.
    </p>
<p>
    When the orchestra falls away, however, and leaves only a
    live band behind, as on the percussive title track and the barroom-bluesy ""The
    Innocence of a Child"", <em>What a Beautiful
    Place</em> points ahead to the more austere singer/songwriter folk-rock era of
    the 70s. Howe's precise phrasing and her sense of formal orderliness recall
    Carole King, whose landmark <em>Tapestry</em>
    was released the same year. ""Nothing More than Strangers"", with its soft bed of
    strings and Scott's burbling piano, is a starkly confessional break-up ballad,
    and stand-out ""Words Through a Locked Door"" recounts the sad tale of a girl
    institutionalized for heartbreak; the song is whimsical, sure, but Howe's
    carefully expressive performance and lyrical detail lend it unexpected gravity.
    </p>
<p>
    As the reissue liners recount, <em>What a Beautiful Place</em> sunk the independent label Reflection
    Records, which was barely able to release the record. Howe would record four
    more albums during the 1970s and another in the 2000s, each of which remains in
    print, if only as an import. So this reissue is a career lynchpin restored, a
    portrait of the artist as a young woman still finding her own beautiful place.

    During his brief career moonlighting as an unofficial talent scout, Devendra Banhart has revealed a weakness for a certain stripe of ethereal, folk-inclined female vocalist. His enthusiasm was instrumental in reviving the careers of long-lost 60s-era performers Vashti Bunyan and Ruthann Friedman, and he has also offered similar support to such younger acts as Natasha Khan's Bat for Lashes and Dallas singer Jana Hunter, whose marvelous 2005 debut album <em>Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom</em> was the first release on Gnomonsong, the label Banhart operates with Vetiver's Andy Cabic. So it shouldn't generate much shock to learn that Gnomonsong's latest discovery, Rio en Medio, the solo project of vocalist/instrumentalist Danielle Stech-Homsy, shares several traits in common with each of these other Banhart favorites.</p><p>
    Co-produced by the Pernice Brothers' Thom Monahan, Rio en Medio's debut <em>The Bride of Dynamite</em> features cameo appearances from Cabic, CocoRosie's Sierra Casady, and David Coulter. Despite this amassed talent, however, the project belongs entirely to Stech-Homsy, and is centered almost exclusively on her delicate, Vashti-like vocals, a few drifting samples, and her baritone ukulele-- an instrument that sounds considerably less exotic in action than it first might appear.</p><p>
    Yet when listening to <em>The Bride of Dynamite</em>, one has to wonder if perhaps Banhart and Gnomonsong might not be getting somewhat ahead of themselves. Stech-Homsy recorded the bulk of this material on her own, with no original intention to release it, and not surprisingly much of it sounds like what used to be quaintly known as a demo tape. With its spare arrangements and extensive use of empty spaces, the album's construction does little to camouflage the fact that Stech-Homsy has yet to fully get her legs beneath her as a songwriter, and as a result too many of these intimate, elliptical pieces feel more like private exercises than vibrant, fleshed-out songs. 
    </p>
<p>
    Adding to <em>The Bride of Dynamite's</em> diffuse impact is Stech-Homsy's decision to cull many of its lyrics from a variety of pre-existing texts. Album opener ""You Can Stand"" takes its lyrics from a 19<sup>th</sup> century poem by Ellen Gates, while ""Europe a Prophecy"" cribs William Blake. Other tracks borrow from poets John Ashbery and Paul Eluard, as well as a vintage Baghdad travelogue by author Freya Stark. And though these texts do provide the album with a valuable multiplicity of voice and perspective, they often do so at the expensive of any kind of authorial continuity and cohesion. 
    </p>
<p>
    Then again, Stech-Homsy fares little better on such self-penned tracks as the cloying ""Tiger's Ear"" or the mawkish lullaby ""Everyone Is Someone's"". ""Everyone is someone's sweet little baby... we were meant for love,"" she coos contentedly on the latter over a thin gauze of ukulele, handclaps, and flitting samples of children's voices-- the ghostly sounds of their disembodied laughter inadvertently lending the tune a vaguely creepy, unsettling overtone. Considerably more successful are group-oriented works such as the sturdy, cello-driven ""Girls on the Run"" or the lightly percolating ""Joe Was on the Plane"" which is bolstered by Tim Fite's electronics and Coulter's evocative work on singing saw. These pieces suggest Stech-Homsy to be well-suited to writing for a larger ensemble, and reports of her further collaborations with Fite sound promising, particularly when contrasted with the halting, hesitant baby steps publicly displayed on <em>The Bride of Dynamite</em>.

    It was never a secret that Willy Mason is a seeker. ""Gotta
    keep movin', gotta keep movin', gotta keep moving with a troubled mind
    a-followin'."" Those were the first words of his 2005 debut, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Where the Humans
    Eat</span><span>. As auditions from singer-songwriters
    go, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Humans</span><span> was all over the map,
    comfortable both in its stylistic diversions and idiosyncratic touches. Wistful
    longings, blues fevers, didactic flurries-- it was all there. When Mason sang
    about traveling, individuality, and solidarity, he was an imperfect guy moving
    with a worn guitar. Compelling even if sometimes a bit naïve, Mason made for a
    believable seeker.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    For <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">If the Ocean Gets Rough</span><span>, Mason's second LP and his debut for Astralwerks, he moves</span><span> like the wanderer he's always
    been. He self-identifies among the hobos on closer ""When the Leaves Have
    Fallen"" and equates the water in his soul to a brisk river rushing toward the
    ocean for ""Riptide"". During ""When the River Moves On""-- textually, the smartest
    song here-- Mason casts his peregrinations in three different contexts: First, as
    a brother trying to absolve a jealous dispute over a shared lover; second, as a
    mother's son who needs to leave the comforts of home to find himself; and
    third, as a Christian who needs to leave his religion's shelter to find
    fairness. But the itinerant wanderer on the major label runs the risk of
    sounding like a citizen on a hill. He's so free because he's simply </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">done</span><span> with the rest of us, you know? That's the
    albatross-- and the catch-- that cripples </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">If the Ocean Gets Rough</span><span>.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ocean</span><span> is in need of a
    hill, or something;</span><span> completely conventional, it finds space for nearly
    every singer-songwriter platitude of the past 40 years beneath one square,
    11-song bill. It's plenty catchy and big, but it's also wildly uncreative and
    predictable. The zest that Mason once brought comes swallowed by a production
    approach that blends the most stock breeds of alt-country and 1970s
    singer-songwriters.
    Even John Mayer (""3x5"") and Dave Matthews (""When the World Ends"") have put more
    adventurous spins on redemption-in-hiding songs. Just feel the mandolin rain
    wetting the dusty, open road of opener ""Gotta Keep Walking"", or hear the gospel
    choir of ""When the River Moves On"" lending the singer the strength he needs to
    sever his ties. Maybe the stock strings-- dark and brittle on the gloomy ""Simple
    Town""; ascending and redemptive on ""Riptide""-- restore Mason's
    fire? Nope: If Mason's purpose in traveling is to find something different, he
    wandered into the wrong studio for </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ocean</span><span>.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    What's more, Mason's lyrics have lost their character-via-quirk.
    Hackneyed production comes met by images of drop-out dreams, broken levees, and
    saving oneself. If <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ocean </span><span>does anything,
    it proves that Mason is just another songwriter with a straightforward voice and
    a limited scope of what coming-of-age songs can be. He's heard Bob Dylan's
    ""Restless Farewell"" and equated its exhausting loneliness with Jackson Browne's
    studio-waxed sadness on ""These Days"". He's emerged with a completely sterile,

    Whether its quickly canonized status as one of the 1990s greatest albums is deserved or not, the one thing about <em>Odelay </em>that seems the most innovative in retrospect is the avalanche of remixes that followed in its wake. No less than four of the album's songs-- ""Devil's Haircut"", ""Where It's At"", ""The New Pollution"", and ""Jack-Ass""-- were released as extended CD or 12"" singles and reworked extensively; ""Devil's Haircut"" alone has somewhere around a half-dozen variations, including Aphex Twin's hyperactive drill-n-bass machete job and a hardcore punk homage/parody titled, amusingly enough, ""American Wasteland"".</p><p>
    While there was a certain hip-hop methodology to the album's sample-heavy construction and production, it still seemed a bit weird and exciting to hear all these reinterpretations; few artists who fell under the rubric of rock (alt- or otherwise) had left their supposedly finished work so open to other artists' alterations. And with so many layers of postmodernism and context-warping already extant in the original music, each additional remix simply blurred whatever sense of meaning the songs-- opaque lyrics and all-- were supposed to have in the first place. Critics called it irony, but it felt more like reverse engineering.</p><p>
    Ten years later, Beck's notion of malleable pop had grown to encompass two introspective psych-folk albums in <em>Mutations</em> and <em>Sea Change</em>, a <em>Dirty Mind</em>-cum-<em>Emotional Resc</em>ue disco-funk monstrosity in <em>Midnite Vultures</em> (which accidentally kickstarted electroclash-- ""Get Real Paid"" has a lot to answer for), and <em>Guero</em>, a disoriented attempt to try and return to a centered idea of what the Beck ""sound"" actually consisted of. The (wrong) answer: a collage of a collage. 
    </p>
<p>
    By the time the mediocrity-stuffed remix album <em>Guerolito </em>came out in early 2006, the idea of easily reconfigurable modular music felt less intriguing than the idea of actually good music, and the summer hype push behind <em>The Information</em>-- make-your-own-design sticker covers, crazy low-budget streaming internet videos, a bunch of blah-de-blah about the user-created-content future of music-- felt less like the excited tinkering of a Fluxus-reared conceptual artist and more like a collar-tugging attempt to grab an audience increasingly disinterested in anything you couldn't put on an iPod. The CD came, the CD went, the press disappointedly mulled over it for a week, and then they moved on to whatever it was Danger Mouse was doing.</p><p>
    Thing is, <em>The Information</em>'s a pretty decent album, and time's been fair to it: After half a year's worth of exposure, the moments that sounded like blatant sore-thumb references on first listen-- the ""Chameleon""-ic fusion funk of ""Cellphone's Dead"", the piano in ""Strange Apparition"" that evokes circa-Altamont Rolling Stones, the synth-bass murmur and crystalline inflections that make ""Dark Star"" sound like a somnambulist take on Stevie Wonder's ""Have a Talk With God""-- feel a bit more integrated into a greater sonic whole, while the album's less-immediate experimental tracks (the micro-Beck ""Motorcade"" and the Eno-lite ""Movie Theme"", in particular) have worked their way from dull, instant skip-overs into tolerable diversions. And Beck's lyrics are some of his most immediate, having developed into a coherent and unobstructed examination of modern-age anxiety without losing their beat-poet opacity. Calling it Beck's best since <em>Odelay </em>is sort of faint praise, but while it doesn't have the feel of a revelatory Event Record, the album does cohere into something evolutionary, using Beck's older work as a starting point instead of a salvage yard. </p><p>
    The irony, of course, is that Beck's attempted user-content toolkit of an album is singular enough to avoid benefiting from a bunch of extraneous, context-altering additional material-- especially in a package as unwieldy as the ""Deluxe Edition"" (has any other album packaging in major-label history made pulling a CD out of a paper sleeve this damn difficult?). Most of the diehard Beck fans who haven't heard the bonus tracks on the first disc probably just haven't figured out the finer points of filesharing, though his attempts at DFA-esque dance-punk (""Inside Out"") and giggling, <em>Clear Spot</em>-style Beefheart funk (the Minutemen/Commodores/Sonic Youth/Jodeci-namedropping ""This Girl That I Know"") are worth hearing at least once. 
    </p>
<p>
    Like the earlier pressings of the October release, the Deluxe Edition also has all those cheapie videos he made with producer Nigel Godrich, though if you're skeeved out by public access-quality cinematography and inane wigs you're probably better off just skipping to the noir-absurdist Michel Gondry clip for ""Cellphone's Dead"". And if you screwed up the sticker design on the cover of your old copy, this one comes with the full four-page set, so you can start it over and then put all the extra ones on your ""Guitar Hero"" guitar or something.</p><p>
    If there's a significant pull to buy <em>this</em> version of the album instead of the slightly cheaper original, it's the full disc of remixes, which are limited in the scope of their source material (three songs, six remixes) but still manage to steer clear of stylistic redundancy. Ellen Allien's propulsive minimal house transformation of ""Cellphone's Dead"" is the most essential track, downplaying the squelchy bassline of the original in favor of the delicate piano that underpinned it and relying on a ghostly-reverbed fragment of the chorus-- ""eye of the sun""-- as the main vocal hook. David Andrew Sitek of TV on the Radio takes a similar route instrumentally on his mix of ""Dark Star"", scaling back everything but the rhythm and Beck's voice for the first couple minutes, then gradually letting a wave of electronics and an Ornette-style free-jazz sax solo bleed their way through. 
    </p>
<p>
    The others are take-or-leave matters: Both attempts at re-envisioning ""Nausea""-- the Bumblebeez's apathetic-sounding indie-disco slog and the Chap's amorphous orchestral electro-- feel less energetic than the original, while Ricardo Villalobos' 14-and-a-half-minute tech-house extension of ""Cellphone's Dead"" comes across like a pre-existing instrumental with the vocals stapled to it; here, Beck sounds like he's leaning against a wall in a state of bewilderment watching other people dance and muttering house-rap verses to himself to stave off his nerves.</p><p>
    So, this is a cash-in. Not like it's a bad time for it, since a relatively sparse stretch of the year like this-- Arcade Fire notwithstanding-- feels like a good occasion to revisit a moderately slept-on album that, if anything, at least transcends its gimmickry. Just be aware that once all the stickers are peeled away and the videos fall into YouTube limbo, most of the enjoyment you'll find on it is in the core of the album as it existed six months ago. It is what it is, and it doesn't need to be anything else.<br/>

    Mark E. Smith has helmed the Fall for a full 30 years. It's pretty mind-blowing to think of them as the institution they've
    become-- this band has always been so strange, prolific, and unpredictable, and
    Smith has built his oddball ranting into a sort of brand by sheer force of
    will. Because of the group's constantly shifting lineups, they've just as capable of releasing several masterpieces in a row as they'd be following them up with two puzzling disasters.</p><p>
    Since signing to Narnack in 2003, the Fall had been on one of their good runs:
    2004's <em>Real New Fall LP</em> was their
    best album in ages, Smith had assembled players with nearly as much punch and muscle
    as the Burns/Hanley/Rogers/Scanlon/Brix crew that made the band's greatest
    stretch of classic in the early to mid-80s, and 2005's <em>Fall Heads Roll</em> was a solid second act in Smith's mini-renaissance.
    The Fall were storming across America
    with all cylinders firing in 2006 when something strange happened: Smith and
    his keyboardist/wife Eleni Poulou woke up in Phoenix
    to find the rest of the band gone, back to the UK unannounced. Only the band
    members know what happened to make them leave-- and Smith does have a history of
    cantankerous relations with his musicians-- but at any rate, Smith and Poulou
    were stuck in the U.S.
    in the middle of a tour with no rhythm section.</p><p>
    So they kept touring, naturally. The first thing to realize
    is that the Fall aren't really a band in the usual sense. It's MES &amp;
    Musicians Currently in His Favour, so he and Poulou simply scraped together
    some guitarists and a drummer and kept going. They wound up going right into a long-scheduled
    studio session in L.A.
    as well, where they cut <em>Reformation Post
    TLC</em>. Remember a few sentences ago when I said the Fall isn't really a band
    in the usual sense? Well, on this record they don't sound like one, either.
    With only a few exceptions, the album is a mess, and not a very memorable one
    at that. 
    </p>
<p>
    I think Smith is referencing the United States of America's ""Coming
    Down"" on opener ""Over! Over!"" when he sings ""I think it's over now I think it's...ending,"" but you'd be hard-pressed to call it a tribute, at least in the same
    way his covers of ""Victoria"", ""Mr. Pharmacist"", and ""I Can Hear the Grass Grow""
    have been in the past. Much more troubling, though, is Smith's tendency to fall
    back on using slurred speech and growls whenever he runs out
    of things to say. He does the wookie thing on ""Over! Over!"" and a few other
    songs, and it's just annoying, the kind of thing he may wind up getting away
    with because, you know, he's Mark E. Smith. But
    I'm not buying it in part because even when he is saying something, he's not
    saying much. He sounds tired and unfocused on most of the record, and when he
    cedes the vocals to Poulou on ""The Wright Stuff"", she basically imitates him, rambling
    over the backing track. 
    </p>
<p>
    More damaging than Smith's unusually incoherent performance,
    though, is the production. The only thing that's uniform about it is that it's
    lousy. The sound on the album is all over the place, and ranges from muffled to
    unevenly mixed-- the mastering level on certain tracks even sounds different from
    the level on others. There are things about the new band, even in the inchoate
    state it was captured in here, that sound promising, so it's a shame the
    texture is so scattered. The aptly named ""Fall Sound"" features a vintage Fall
    groove, with the whole band locked in tightly, guitars nagging at the edges of
    a thick bass line, but Smith doesn't do much with it, gargling on the intro and
    wandering in and out of his usual sneering deadpan. You almost wonder if he's
    just telling the truth when he shouts, ""It's a scream for help that's desperate.""
    </p>
<p>
    ""White Line Fever""'s country aesthetic is somewhat interesting but it needed more time in the
    oven-- if they develop this angle, it could be a good new direction. Going into
    much more detail than that doesn't serve the record well, but suffice to say
    that ""Das Bootuboat"" is the worst Fall track this decade; it trudges
    through a sludge bath of bass, wobbly sound effects, jokey chanting, and other sonic
    muck. It sounds like an incidental track when it stops around two minutes in,
    but then it comes back for another eight minutes to go nowhere slowly all over
    again. 
    </p>
<p>
    More than anything, it seems as though this version of
    Fall is ill-served by the first album it made. There are moments of clarity
    when the band sounds fantastic, but they're not enough to save the record from
    landing in the band's forget pile. The rhythm section can play its guts out,
    but if Mark E. Smith isn't leading the charge and dripping acid, it won't come
    to much good. <em>Reformation Post TLC</em> is
    ultimately a record that was made out of stubbornness, and one that almost
    certainly could have been better if they'd taken more time to write and
    rehearse it before recording it.

While they've been more known for EPs and seven-inches until now, <em>Hidden World</em> is the work of a band that sounds much older and more assured than it should.</p><p>
    But even as I type out punk, it doesn't quite fit: You could call it hardcore, as singer Pink Eyes chokes out every syllable like Negative Approach's John Brannon. You could call it experimental because the songs are longer and they have violins; you could still call it punk, as even with all of that, it doesn't stray too far from home base, from four or five blissfully overdriven guitar chords. It steps outside just enough to show you how daring it can be, before reminding you one more time how its gonna fuck you up. <em>Hidden World</em> finds a sort of perfect balance between musical ambition and staying true to the formula, dishing out scads of overdriven three-chord punk pleasers while adding the barest traces of a band with more omniverous ears: Some violins close out ""Carried Out to the Sea"", a little spoken word adds some healthy pretension to opener ""Crusades"", and a fantastical element elsewhere to ""David Comes to Live"". These might sound like shoehorning or attention-grabbing on paper-- truth be told, they're bookends to these songs at best-- but these small touches only serve to make these ambitious songs sound even more enormous.</p><p>
    In ""Crusades"", a single guitar chord sustains for eons over a twinkling new-age chorus, before their two-note bludgeoning and rabid-dog vocals begin and they maul the familiar formula, leaving those clichés beaten within an inch of their lives. They then run off to dig on some fantastic and impenetrable story about an impatient young boy named David who's ""gonna get to heaven tonight,"" but with an altogether different plan than your Meatloaf-inspired, dashboard-light-style pursuit. All that somehow clocks in at under three minutes; even at their most concise, FU songs like ""David"" and ""Carried Out to the Sea"" feel epic because of their extra flourishes.
    </p><p>
    Yet even at its most straightforward, the record still thrills, nowhere better evidenced than the gloriously confrontational ""Baiting the Public"", one of FU's best singles: Six minutes of an indomitable guitar and double-bass-drum attack where Pink Eyes berates anyone within earshot, punching in his vocal from either speaker like a Devil on one shoulder and an undead fire-swallower who makes Satan look like a pussy on the other. Calmer and almost classical details follow, however, with a dollop of creepy whispering that introduces the bouncing guitar line of ""Blaze of Glory"", featuring the album's catchiest hook that praises ""small town hucksters, and big city freaks"" with maximum fist-pump praise, as well one of the many appearances of Owen Pallett (Final Fantasy, Arcade Fire), handling all the album's violin parts. 
    </p>
<p>
    All this would fall flat on its face if FU didn't do the traditional punk thing so perfectly; as is, their aspirations are just the icing on the cake-- a cake with a file in it, with a grenade on the end of the file. The final chords of ""Fate of Fates"" grind off each other, echoing back and forth through their own purgatory, only to serve as a dramatic introduction to the spitting venom of ""Two Snakes"", a groove that never tires over its many permutations, including a muted violin-string pluck and Reich-like build-up in its last few seconds. Pink Eyes, meanwhile, never relents from his foaming, strangulated delivery throughout <em>Hidden World</em>, but not so hoarsely that you can't make out his lyrical concerns, ranging from the Book of Enoch and saving our eternal souls to fucking your wife. No concept or approach is too lofty or too stupid; in fact, <em>Hidden World</em> is an incredible testament to the great art then happens when the two meet. Middlebrow hardcore rules OK?

    Don't mistake WinterKids for this year's <em>NME</em>-approved worst band
    ever. Big-budget boy bangs and popped collars aside, the Surrey five-piece
    aren't another ""guitars are cool again"" hero-worship exercise like
    Razorlight or the Vines. Nor do they bank on pseudo-intellectual histrionics
    like Panic! at the Disco. With a less stiflingly stodgy approach to pop than
    the garage rock revivalists and a better memory for mall-punk's catchiness than
    those emo brats, WinterKids write hooks, not haircuts. Not <em>only</em>
    haircuts, anyway.</p><p>
    WinterKids' full-length debut, <em>Memoirs</em>, recalls teenage heartbreak
    with good cheer and a measure of wit. It never betters the easy pop gestalt of
    breakout single ""Tape It"", which gets at awkward adolescent
    butterflies without overreaching or self-congratulation. There's just one verse
    repeated twice, a yearning bridge, and plenty of stupidly great choruses,
    organized around Bradley Osborne's exclamatory guitar fills and singer James
    Snider's youthful enthusiasm. I'm still not entirely sure what this song is
    about-- videotaping your favorite show because the girl you used to watch it
    with just sent you a ""Dear John"" text, presumably-- but its
    basic-as-being-dumped melody feels beyond reproach.</p><p>
    If ""Tape It"" sets the WinterKids template, the rest of <em>Memoirs</em>
    generally does its damnedest to match up. Songs like ""Hear Me Out"",
    ""All the Money"", and ""Use Your Feet"" put more big choruses
    (and the occasional handclaps) to another set of succinct guitar lines, Bloc
    Party-ing bass grooves, analog synths, Pipettes-like female backing vocals, and
    a whole lotta unrequited longing. Yet for all their energy, these tracks'
    predictable songwriting keeps them from equaling the sum of their parts.
    ""Didn't take too long/ to write another song,"" Snider admits on
    ""Adore"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Other tracks betray the outsize ambitions ""Tape It"" goofily
    realizes. But merely <em>sounding</em> ambitious doesn't sound nearly as good.
    For proof, there's drippy ballad ""Somebody Else's Clothes"", where
    banjos, fake strings, and a cappella harmonies don't help answer Snider's
    questions about ""knowing what's right."" Swollen piano waltz
    ""Playing Cards With Gingerbread"" takes a similar misstep, capping the
    album with a pompous reflection on touring life that builds into <em>Neon Bible</em>-reading
    sound and fury. <em>Memoirs</em> works best when producer Fraser Smith (who
    turned lesser compositions to gold for the likes of Rachel Stevens and Jamelia)
    can set aside his philosopher's stone and just, well, tape it.

Kinetic cadences are this young Berkeley band's biggest asset, and a youthfully hyperactive energy powers their self-released EP, <i>The Get Down</i>. What's interesting about the record is that there's nothing particularly interesting about it-- no nested mythology, no broadcasted back-story, no musicological innovation, no David Bowie hanging out at their shows. It's fresh-- as in ""enthusiastic""-- but it's certainly not new, and at a time when blognoise and self-promotion tend to resonate longer and louder than the music they tangentially relate to, it's refreshing to hear a young band playing vigorous songs without too much hullabaloo about why and how they're doing it.</p>
<p>If I were Tempo No Tempo's publicist, I would have to say that they're blending their influences into something uniquely their own. But since I'm not, I can level with you-- Tempo No Tempo are blending their influences into something uniquely collective. This is only a crime if you subscribe to the view that there's such a thing as original art, although even the most cursory survey of human creation reveals a fertile history of borrowing, re-imagining, and outright theft. I prize innovation, but not to the detriment of the well-crafted artifact. The internet's endlessly expanding cultural record has ample room for both.</p>
<p>The <i>Get Down</i>'s simple pleasures are a fine entry in the latter category, evoking Bloc Party and Q and Not U with its poppy dancepunk flavor. It's a jagged, melodious blast from start to finish, and it's marked by a sort of good-natured urgency. If it has rough edges and a certain ingenuous quality, these are mostly endearing, and it's a respectable first effort. ""A Different Weapon"" cranks up with a halting disco rhythm and a jumpy guitar melody; cheerful keyboard accents flesh it out and singer Tyler McCauley's throaty yelp sounds fit for mean karaoke renditions of Joy Division. ""Plus the Wolf"" evokes Thunderbirds are Now! with its jittery guitar whorls and synth sound effects, taking a more slantwise approach to the band's breakneck momentum than the defiantly linear ""A Different Weapon"". The sumptuous synth peals on ""Static"" are reminiscent of Maritime's, but Tempo No Tempo favors pummeling overdrive above that band's glittery updraft, although a touch of that emo-cum-new-wave sensibility manifests in the whirling siren-lights of ""State of Emergency"". In a world of broken molds, it's easy to forget about the pleasures of enthusiastic formalism; Tempo No Tempo are here to remind us.</p></div>"|9969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9969-the-get-down-ep/|6.0|Brian Howe

    Few things are more dangerous to good pop than a perfectly talented artist who thinks his music isn't smart enough. It's the sort of attitude that combines the most perilous ideas a musician can have-- the urge to ignore or downplay the strengths of his past work; an underestimation of what that supposedly inadequate music actually means to fans; a presumptuous, elitist idea of what ""advancement"" involves-- and then pins an uncomfortable impetus on the longtime listener: If you're not ready to grow and expand with this new style, maybe you'd be better off bobbing your heads to that old slapdash bullshit with the rest of the safety-craving bandwagoneers.</p><p>
    There was an understandably furious internet reaction to a quote from a mid-2004 allhiphop.com interview with Rjd2, where the then-in-demand indie rap producer claimed that he considered much of his hip-hop production to be ""moron music."" It was a tossed-off dismissal that implicated everything from his well-aging 2002 debut <em>Deadringer</em> (which boasted ""The Horror"", without question one of the most amped-up hell-yeah hip-hop instrumentals of the decade) to his rock-solid work with Soul Position to the sharp Pete Rock-caliber ""Saliva"", the best beat on Viktor Vaughn (MF Doom)'s<em> Vaudeville Villain</em>. And while his attempts to straighten up the quote's context were fervent-- helpfully clarifying that he didn't think all hip-hop production was dumb, he just felt mentally stunted making his own sometimes-- it's still difficult to avoid feeling as though you've been played like a sucker for investing a lot more time and interest into that music than its creator apparently did.</p><p>
    It all seemed to come to a head near the release of <em>Since We Last Spoke</em>, released around the time of that infamous interview: As an expansion of Rjd2's post-Shadow blueprint, it was a successful effort at making a mostly-instrumental, retro-minded but current-sounding funk/rock album using hip-hop production techniques. But successive interviews and articles revealed that it also caused enough engineering headaches to lead Rj to believe that sample-hunting was a dead end, that ProTools was the enemy, and that he was really just meant to be a pop songwriter like Elliott Smith or Britt Daniel.</p><p>
<em>The Third Hand</em> is Rjd2's Big Important Musical Statement, meant to announce his transformation from lumpenprole beat flogger to true pop (read: rock) artist: Aside from the drums, everything on the album originates from a Real Live Instrument played by Rj, which he then pieces together and warps into shape like some sort of Todd Rundgren homunculus. It sadly turns out to be an unsettling piece of evidence that he's lost without someone else's pre-existing sounds to extrapolate from and transform. He still draws from other artists' ideas<em>-- The Third Hand</em> is rife with flashes of indie pop touchstones like Stereolab, Syd Barrett-era Floyd, and the Zombies-- but the album resembles an overambitious Money Mark record, bloated keyboards crowding his grooves until they sound cramped and irritable. Between the quivering harps, weepy mellotrons, and delicate, pixie-dust electronics that litter the album, Rj must think  all you need to do to transmogrify into a pop genius is to imagine what the soundtrack to a Zach Braff remake of <em>Wild Style</em> would sound like.</p><p>
    What still remains of his hip-hop backbone-- the powerful, charging drum breaks that were his stock in trade dating back to his Mhz days-- feels grossly out of place. The beats feel bullish and overbearing amidst all the lightness, giving turbocharged propulsion to songs that feel like they're better off ambling, and forcing uprock rhythms to rudely stuff paisley ascots into their Adidas track tops. ""Rules for Normal Living"" is a particularly weird attempt at a dance track, sticking the album's only semblance of an electro-style beat in the middle of the track-- almost as a punchline-- and bookending it with a wheezing plod that sounds like the fat, arthritic version of Kraftwerk's ""Tour de France"". ""Sweet Piece"" is even more baffling: The Gap Band's ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me"" funklessly gussied up, a neutered caricature of a groove that loses all its promise once you figure out that its idea of a melodic instrumental hook is a noodle-armed shrug of a synth riff that evaporates almost immediately. ""Just When"" ganks the opening beat to ""Billie Jean"" (or an incredible simulation of it) and turns its sleek, minimalist 4/4 into a cluttered, halting traffic jam. 
    </p>
<p>
    Much of the disappointment of <em>The Third Hand</em> is that of expectation, and elements that initially register as nauseating treacle can sometimes sneak up on you. The two best instrumental tracks on the record, ""Get It"" and ""The Bad Penny"", lack the bravado and heaviness of his earlier work but still feel alive and well-crafted, even as they strain for a baroque psychedelia they can't quite reach. But another reason they stand out is that Rj doesn't sing on them. Prior to this record, <em>Since We Last Spoke</em>'s closing track, ""Through the Walls"", was his only other significant attempt at writing pop lyrics, and with his flat, non-committal voice hesitantly muttering words that sounded like power-pop fridge magnet poetry, it practically demanded that someone with a bit more presence take over on lead vocal. (Fortunately, someone hollered for Ric Ocasek to do the remix.) The other vocal number on that record-- the wispy, syrupy Labi Siffre cover ""Making Days Longer""-- is the unfortunate precedent for Rj's turn toward vocal melody, and the same halfhearted falsetto runs rampant over <em>The Third Hand</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    Typically overdubbed into semi-coherent oblivion and grinding gears between deadpan and over-dramatic, his voice is a grating mess, creaking out non-sequitur high notes and juggling both fake-Brit (Bille Joe Armstrong sounds like Ray Davies in comparison) and fake-soul (ibid. Jamie Lidell and Teddy Pendergrass) affectations. Not that any voice could save the lyrics: Between the poorly-scanning turns of phrase (""She can get plump off of beer and meatloaf,"" from ""You Never Had It So Good""), the pointless similes (""Little princess/ With her little ways gone bad/ You should ask her/ About the dates she had/ Mr. Legend, Dr. Civic and Mr. Lexus,"" from ""Sweet Piece"") and the out-of-touch stabs at populist subject matter (""Have Mercy"" makes working a job downtown sound as harrowing as the woes in a Lightnin' Hopkins song), Pharrell can rest easy knowing that ""Her ass is a spaceship/ I want to ride"" has plummeted in ""rap producer-turned-singer writes something laughable"" standings.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <em>The Third Hand</em> is aptly-titled: It feels like a step below second-hand. Would it have felt any less ridiculous if it were an out-of-nowhere debut from someone we'd never heard of instead of an attempted breakthrough by one of underground hip-hop's best producers? Marginally, if that. And maybe if Rj works out the flaws and figures out his limitations, chances are he'll do what a few other writers have predicted and produce a pretty good Gorillaz record in a few years. But after reading him say that he's more interested in making records people would want to sample than sampling other peoples' records, one can only hope he's right and that some future producer can salvage something from this debacle.

    Four decades after its release, Nico's first solo album<em> Chelsea Girls</em> remains her most famous. Its bittersweet folk-pop has continually grown in stature, even hitting a pop culture peak a few years ago when ""These Days"" showed up repeatedly in commercials and films. Less well-known is how much Nico despised the album. The lithe melodies (written by ex-boyfriends Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, and Lou Reed, among others) and ornate string arrangements struck an irresistible contrast to her chilly vocals.  But to Nico they were the antithesis of her own artistic core.</p><p>
    Her next two albums, 1969's <em>The Marble Index</em> and 1970's <em>Desertshore</em>, are more accurate representations of her dark, dramatic vision. They may not have achieved the renown of <em>Chelsea Girls</em>, but they've held up just as well, if not better, artistically. <em>The Frozen Borderline: 1968-1970</em> is a UK-only deluxe combination of both albums, appending 18 alternate versions to the pair's original 16 songs.</p><p>
    After <em>Chelsea Girls</em>, apparently on the suggestion of Leonard Cohen, Nico took up the harmonium, an accordion sibling that's usually foot-operated. But Nico played a portable, hand-operated Indian version, and the instrument's droning tone was an apt counterpart to her obliquely tragic songs.  Spending four days in an Elektra studio in L.A., she recorded 12 pieces with John Cale, who wrapped a rich pastiche of viola, piano, guitar, and more around Nico's harmonium and vocals.
    </p>
<p>
    The result is a strange, moving album that Lester Bangs called in a 1978 review ""the greatest piece of 'avant-garde classical' 'serious' music of the last half of the 20th century so far.""  He also said it scared the shit out of him.  There is certainly an underlying bleakness that can make <em>The Marble Index</em> a strenuous listen. But Nico's melodies are so hypnotic, and Cale's sonics are so fertile and unpredictable, that it's hard not to be entranced by these songs.
    </p>
<p>
    Sure, Nico's cryptic lyrics about ""the end of time,"" ""the heaving sea,"" and ""frozen warnings"" sound grim, but her Teutonic croon could've made commercial jingles seem foreboding. For every sad line or aching refrain, there's the touching beauty of ""Ari's Song"", the rising viola of the pristine ""Frozen Warnings"", the pulsating piano of ""Facing The Wind"".<em> The Marble Index</em> may seem to strike only one note, but inside it Nico and Cale found a universe of possibilities.
    </p>
<p>
    The original release of <em>The Marble Index</em> included eight of the 12 songs Nico recorded for it. <em>The Frozen Borderline</em> adds the other four, plus alternate versions of every track save the opening instrumental ""Prelude"". Some of these alternates are different mixes of Cale's contributions, but the most interesting present Nico alone with just her harmonium. The sparser setting gives the songs a sunnier feel, transforming the stirring ""No One Is There"" and the reflective ""Julius Caesar (Memento Hodie)"" from maudlin to bittersweet.
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Marble Index</em>'s lackluster sales led Elektra to drop Nico, but in 1970 Reprise picked her up, and she and Cale teamed again to make<em> Deserstshore</em>, included here on disc two. Many prefer it to <em>The Marble Index</em> for its sonic variety and wider range of moods, and it definitely sounds more open and less claustrophobic than its predecessor.  But the album has too many soft and even saccharine moments to be perfect. The sappy melody of ""Afraid"" and the tinkly ice-dancer piano of ""The Falconer"" aren't crimes in and of themselves, but they keep <em>Desertshore</em> from matching the intense purity of <em>The Marble Index</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, there are a lot of great songs here, and Nico's voice remains unerring, perhaps even stronger than before. On opener ""Janitor of Lunacy"" a slight strain in her voice adds urgency, while the German lyrics of ""Abscheid"" slice through Cale's viola like an icicle puncturing a snowdrift. And nothing quite compares to the creepy ""Le Petit Chevalier"", a nursery rhyme sung by Nico's eight-year-old son Ari.
    </p>
<p>
    The extra tracks on this disc are mostly harmonium-and-voice versions of the album's originals, and in many cases they sound better. ""Afraid"" becomes the haunting ""You Are Beautiful (Afraid)"", more like an elegy than the original's soft ballad, and the droning ""The Falconer"" is stranger and darker than its more ornate counterpart. It's perhaps sacrilege to prefer these sparser versions, and the <em>Desertshore</em> originals certainly offer more sonically. But Nico's solo takes are welcome breaths of fresh, uncomplicated air.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>The Frozen Borderline </em>ends with a hidden version of ""Frozen Warnings"", Nico's signature song from this period. Here, the arrangement is pared down to just Nico's voice and Cale's viola. Its stoic beauty is a perfect synopsis of this great period and just might represent the peak of both of these artists' stellar careers.  Either way, <em>The Frozen Borderline</em> is an essential document of a high watermark in avant-rock history.

    Cheeseburger have got nothing up their sleeves, which makes the sting of
    their sucker punch all the more glorious. Don't try to look for it, there's no
    wink here to assure you this classic rock posturing is the least bit
    tongue-in-cheek. That said, judging this Brooklyn trio's debut by your first
    visceral impression may be the best way to enjoy them-- as long as you don't
    have a weak stomach. Everything about the band is pretty much
    what-you-see/what-you-get to the extreme: They're called Cheeseburger, they
    play greasy, sloppy, unapologetically American cock rock that goes well with
    beer (or a handle of Jack). They write a cry-for-help rocker called
    ""Tiger"", they make a video for it featuring singer Joe Bradley
    wearing a tiger suit. They're a rock band, so they craft an album completely
    obsessed with being in a rock band, sans the calculated commentary of similarly
    self-aware groups like Art Brut or Brakes.</p><p>
    In fact, it's hard to imagine anything is calculated here. These schlubs
    simply pluck classic rock motifs from their subconscious and get 'em drunk. For
    example, you could accuse ""Money For the Heart"" of ripping the Who's
    ""Can't Explain"" riff, but guitarist Christy Karacas butchers it,
    essentially co-opting the guitar hook by mutilation. Bradley is hardly any more
    coherent, seemingly blacking out as he garbles inebriated battle cries
    (""Hey, hey, the gang's all here/ What a bunch of fucking queers!"")
    and continuously preaching the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.</p><p>
    The band has nabbed their fair share of Stooges comparisons, thanks in large
    part to Bradley's self-destructive Iggy Pop affectations. However, excepting
    shorter, unstable numbers like ""Pirate"" or ""Rats"", these
    songs roar with a rock 'n' roll majesty that's a little too unseemly for garage
    punk. Sure, it's just vocals, one guitar, and drums, but the back-to-back
    onslaught of ""Easy Street"" and ""Hot Streets"" could rock any
    arena with its meaty chord progressions and dramatic loud-soft dynamics. By
    ""Do You Remember?"", the band's punk ethics become irrevocably
    blurred, but the song's makeshift AOR hooks render the issue a moot point.
    </p>
<p>
    As the decadent rock bacchanalia continues, though, the band's intensity
    falters, leaving you wishing they'd stretch their limits rather than thrashing
    through the same three-chord blitz. ""Cocaine"" feels like an
    uninspired, obligatory drug anthem, with Bradley not-so-cleverly feminizing the
    drug over a lagging guitar riff. Likewise, ""Gang's All Here"" retreads
    the album's bright spots, reeking of redundancy and diffusing any excitement
    the song's titular chorus tries to generate. In many ways, Cheeseburger is exactly
    what critics of innocuous, limp-wristed indie rock have been asking for, it's
    just that the band overcompensated a bit. For every soft-spoken indie group cooing
    about trees over keyboards, this debut tries to match it with ham-handed
    guitar heroics and a couple shouts of ""motherfucker,"" and there's
    something honorable in their impossible struggle to do so, however garish the
    result.

    When you're at the end of your rope, they say, either commit suicide or travel. Thankfully Hrishikesh Hirway  traveled, cross-country and even to India, embarking late on one of those somber searching-for-yourself <em>Wanderjahre</em>s. From this Ivy Leaguer you might expect a strain of clever self-flagellation falling, in his own words, ""somewhere between bedroom electronica and singer/songwriter."" But Hirway's music, performed with violinist Jane Yakowitz under the name The One AM Radio, isn't so cut-and-dry. Like Múm on a smaller scale, or a lightly medicated, loose-lipped Four Tet, his introspective songs sway hazily from image to metaphor, between yesterday's folk and tomorrow's digitalism.</p><p>
    Where 2004's <em>A Name Writ in Water</em> flirted with confession, his third full-length <em>This Too Will Pass</em> verges on pure autobiography, a micro-saga of vagabonding and unraveling romance. For a diary in sound, this leans heavily on that old shortcut to immediacy: the second-person. But despite all the you-this and you-that, Hirway never sounds bitter; he's not pointing fingers. ""You still felt the same, you said,"" he sings on ""In the Time We've Got"", strangely impassive. ""But a longing crept into the eyes I'd known."" Shepherding us like a tour guide through his own memory, he recites without regret, reports without passing judgment.</p><p>
    Of course, the ubiquitous ""you"" is a past lover. Echoes of faraway percussion evoke their growing emotional distance, in ""Lest I Forget"", as recent grief starts chipping away at their relationship. ""You lost too much too fast,"" he consoles her. As the next verse concludes, the line changes to ""You changed so much so fast."" Hirway handles these classic, easily fumbled themes with rare grace. It could have been a mawkish wreck-- ""the words <em>I don't love you anymore</em>,"" the drowning-saving trope, the oversold tragedy-- but ""Cast Away"" elegantly recreates the dullness of iced-over love, of being somewhere only physically, lost in either a sleepless funk or dreams ""of the same underwater scene/ Where you nearly made your peace.""
    </p>
<p>
    Hirway mines dreams and nature to telegraph a range of complicated feelings. On ""In the Time We've Got"" he turns a few scenes, with changing-seasons symbolism, into a collage about foreseeing The Split. ""You had the city in you,"" Hirway sighs on the chorus, draping the whole affair with star-crossed resignation. The ache of recent events has-- at least for this moment-- undone him, reversing what seemed on <em>Writ</em> like a fork-in-the-road decision to embrace his Tamborello-lite, electronic side. He also scales back the flowery emo lyricism that marred that effort. This album is folk to the bone, raw and self-emptying in the vein of Elliott Smith's <em>Roman Candle</em>. But in merely reciting and reporting, Hirway assumes not Smith's wounded whisper, all radiance and suffering, but a sleepy detachment, as if the trauma numbed him or time healed him. Accents of hope streak this anthology on loneliness: The golden days may pass, as the title reminds us, but so will the hard times.

    I'm generally reluctant to participate in 6th-grade English teacher
    crusades against the words ""pretty"" and ""nice""; it's a war sold on
    completely bogus intelligence. Sorry, Mrs. D: Sometimes these adjectives <em>do</em> aptly
    modify their subjects. In fact, Brooklyn singer-songwriter Chris Garneau's debut, <em>Music for Tourists</em>,
    could almost have been a bold assault <em>on behalf of</em> pretty niceness. Instead, it's a reminder that most of us self-proclaimed nice guys
    eventually turn into drunken a-holes.</p><p>
    To put it as gently as I know how, <em>Music for Tourists</em> makes
    early Damien Rice sound musically adventurous. Garneau
    reduces Elliott Smith's archetypal misery to the level of cliché, with
    Prozac-commercial poetry and a high, fluttery whisper that sounds like Elmo
    tickling Sufjan Stevens on suicide watch. People cry and people die-- sometimes
    in the same couplet-- as piano and strings lend dreary
    accompaniment, sheathed in sterile production work from has-been MOR folk-pop darling (and now budding Broadway
    composer!) Duncan Sheik.</p><p>
    Over meandering piano chords on ""We Don't Try"",
    Garneau sings, ""It's easy if you cry, because you feel bad for
    yourself."" And that's pretty much <em>Music for Tourists</em>. The album
    rarely misses an opportunity for tell-not-show bleakness. After a pizzicato
    cello opening, waltz-time ""Castle-Time"" reminisces about an
    elementary-school teacher's death, forever ago. ""Let's cry about it,""
    Garneau urges in grim multi-track harmony. Maybe if he did a little more
    convincing.
    </p>
<p>
    Sometimes Garneau waxes philosophical, too. ""Our lives, they won't keep
    us alive,"" he laments on wobbly solo number ""Blue Suede
    Shoes""-- unfortunately not a cover. But hidden track ""Between the
    Bars"" <em>is</em>, and cries out for a metronome as the singer takes a
    melodramatic shit on the aforementioned Smith's fucked-up memory. Garneau also cops a Jeff Buckley vibrato on ""Black &amp; Blue"", moaning,
    ""I wanna catch my death of cold/ 'Cause I'm scared I'm growing old."" That's just terrible. 
    </p>
<p>
    At least Garneau shares my taste in diction. On mopey blogger fave ""Not
    Nice"", he squeaks, ""When you're not being nice/ You're not nice/
    You're not nice/ You're not nice,"" brushing against a Chris Martin
    falsetto. The plodding indie-gypsy of ""First Place!!!"" adds bent
    acoustic guitar notes and a pack of backing singers, as Garneau describes a
    house with ""nice things inside."" But melismatic ""Hymn"", with
    electric organ replacing piano, proves more telling than any other track here: ""Try and think of
    nice things to say,"" Garneau pleads. Hmm. Maybe I'd better not say anything at all.

But the world's not a     fair place, as our parents constantly remind us. In the interval between the     album's original street date in 2003 and its deluxe reissue in 2007-- a     relatively short span for a reissue-- Sun Kil Moon's former label, Jetset Records, let the album     fall into limbo. During that same interval, however, frontman Mark Kozelek     started his own boutique label, Caldo Verde, which has already produced a     handful of releases, including Sun Kil Moon's notorious Modest Mouse covers     album and Kozelek's <i>Little Drummer Boy     Live</i>. Considering these factors, this reissue seems almost inevitable, an     act of survival instead of a mere moneymaker or legacygrabber.</p>
<p><i>Ghosts</i> continues--     even fine-tunes-- the work Kozelek did with his former band, the Red House     Painters. These songs are virtuously stoic Americana--     all shimmery guitars, measured tempos, malevolent moods, and wandering melodies.     His voice, then as now, sounds like Neil Young's, especially in the     effortlessness with which he hits the high notes then returns to a lower,     earthier texture. But Kozelek possesses a steady imperturbability that Young,     with his soul-music background, eschewed. As the title suggests, <i>Ghosts</i> is a travelogue of sorts,     speeding through the Midwest and the West; in this sense,     it's the male equivalent to Lucinda Williams' <i>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</i>, especially in the imperfect mirroring     of physical terrain and emotional geography. Bruised masculinity is the album's     central theme, however, evident in odes to boxers, matadors, serial killers,     and musicians, all of whom inhabit the same lonely stretch of road.</p>
<p>The album opens with ""Glenn Tipton"", a nod to the     Judas Priest guitarist. That the song is finally revealed to be delivered from     the point of view of a serial killer is a quiet shock: Kozelek's carefully     detailed songwriting makes the narrator not just familiar, but sympathetic. The     revelation takes the song away from the confessional and into the raconteurish,     where the album remains for nine more uniformly strong tracks. Tying everything     together is a trilogy about dead boxers, beginning with ""Salvador Sanchez"" and     ending with ""Pancho Villa"". In the middle is the 14-minute ""Duk Koo Kim"", which     sprawls furtively for several rounds, its guitars bobbing and weaving     gracefully and noisily (the song's subject necessarily conjures Warren Zevon's     ""Boom Boom Mancini"", about the boxer who killed Kim in the ring). Kozelek     approaches these pugilists-- and all his characters-- like he's Raymond Carver,     parsing the details until he finds the one that makes them real.</p>
<p>Typically, it's the musical details that do just that. The     band Kozelek assembled for <i>Ghosts</i>-- Anthony     Koutsos (Red House Painters), Tim Mooney (American Music Club), and Geoff     Stanfield (Black Lab), along with a few guests-- ably but subtly bolster his     lyrics and vocals, generating a steady clip that never flags. Tempos rarely vary between or even within songs, and the guitars     find a spectral riff and settle down with it, repeating it with gentle relentlessness     that needles the characters and refracts the melodies. The result is an album     as hypnotic as highway divider lines whizzing past.</p>
<p>Neglecting demos or earlier works, the six-track bonus EP is     notable mostly for showing how easily Kozelek translated these songs from     electric to acoustic settings. These alternate or radio readings of ""Carry Me     Ohio"", ""Salvador Sanchez"", and ""Gentle Moon"" aren't too far removed from their     originals, despite having only Kozelek's voice in common. This testifies to the     flexibility of his songwriting and the adaptability of his performances, and     yet it all adds up to a pretty lackluster EP, offering no specific insight into     the songs' development before or after the album. The remaining bonus tracks     consist of an unreleased instrumental similar to ""Sí, Paloma"" and two versions     of the same Leonard Bernstein cover. Fortunately, Kozelek has better luck with     ""Somewhere"" than with any of Isaac Brock's tunes, transforming it from a staged     number into a despairing ballad... twice. They're the twin highlights of a     skippable EP, but that mild disappointment is considerably assuaged by the fact     that <i>Ghosts</i> is back in print.</p></div>"|9958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9958-ghosts-of-the-great-highway/|8.0|Stephen M.

    Patrick Wolf is growing up. The classically trained, left-of-center indie star's colorful adolescence and early twenties were unusually productive, resulting in two charming albums (2003's <em>Lycanthropy</em> and 2005's <em>Wind in the Wires</em>) that found delicate string-and-piano pop pieces laced with guttural electronics. Both were charismatic but maudlin efforts, full of bittersweet montages, percussion-heavy compositions, and pissy, spit-out vocals that documented search after fruitless search for enlightenment or joy-- but if it all seemed a bit self-absorbed, there was no denying Wolf had a way with a melody.</p><p>
    With <em>The Magic Position</em>, though, Wolf shakes off much of the brooding insularity that clouded his previous records, refining his melodic strengths and overcoming his tendency toward sullen introspection. Album opener ""Overture"" has an energetic, marching pulse, its ascending violin line providing a lilting and confident backbone as Wolf announces his newly discovered positivity. He's ""found the major key,"" as he states in the title cut, and it's in that key that Wolf affirms his growth not just as a songwriter, but as an entertainer. Where <em>Wind in the Wires</em>' musical potency was sometimes overshadowed by Wolf's penchant for melodrama, <em>The Magic Position </em>takes cues from Kate Bush, Antony, and Current 93 (and, okay, sometimes just a <em>little</em> Adam Ant) to turn his natural theatricality into an asset: Here, it's used to lend a sense of ethereal drama, to set scenes, tell stories, and imbue the record with a sort of campy, reverent mysticism.</p><p>
    But what still stands out most is the songs themselves: These tracks-- especially the upbeat springtime romp ""Get Lost"", the danceable, triumphant ""Accident and Emergency"", and the celebratory title track-- show an entirely new side of Wolf: one that finally puts impeccable pop songcraft ahead of lachrymose keening. The title track, in particular, is a stunner, riding a cantering violin riff to a soaring, staccato pop anthem. The keyboard's playful, ascending scale acts as a cheerful motif as the song twists off in unexpected directions with sudden melodic breaks and interludes, and juxtaposes Wolf's lyrical darkness with sonic brightness. 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, it's worth noting that, for all the frolicking glee, Wolf's melancholy hasn't entirely vanished-- it's just that it's no longer
    quite so cheerless. Granted, for Wolf to have discovered optimism may seem like an ominous transformation to fans content to be swaddled in cryptic early gems like ""The Libertine"", but the distinctive, ornate qualities of his first two records remain. And what's taken the place of all that narcissistic grief-- a crucial sense of self-awareness and the resolution of some very elementary identity issues-- has allowed him an artistic and lyrical progression that results in refined and concentrated updates like ""The Stars"", which insightfully links family and nature, or the virtuosic ballad ""Augustine"", while retaining a spirited, anthemic quality that puts them confidently at home in the same body of work.

Even way-out exploratory underground rap albums like Cannibal Ox's <em>The Cold Vein</em> tend to foreground voices and drums in the mix; in Dälek's music, there's no foreground at all. The voice of MC/producer Dälek (this is one of those confusing groups where the name of the duo is also the name of a dude in the duo) burbles up half-obscured from the thick, heady mix, ghostly in the way it suddenly appears and vanishes while shifting, heaving masses of drums, strings, guitars, and synths scream and flare and buckle around it. And so the actual rapping is only one element in the group's dense compositions, which layer scores of tiny components into woozy, disorienting symphonies of noise. So it's not a huge surprise that most of the group's support comes from the noise and metal undergrounds; they're more likely to tour with Isis or the Melvins than with, say, Aesop Rock. On playlists, they sound better next to Current 93 or Scott Walker than Sean Price or Rich Boy. It's not that rap doesn't have room for maverick explorers like these guys; it's that the group's explorations have led them to actively repudiate nearly all of rap's defining characteristics. They've opted out of the race and into something else.</p><p>
    The duo's last album, 2005's <em>Absence</em>, was an hour of ugly, discordant squalls, and it was still somehow the most accessible thing they'd ever made. On <em>Abandoned Language</em>, though, Dälek's impulses tend more toward the contemplative than the assaultive, but they're still as queasy and indistinct as ever. The opening title track is an ambitious, 10-minute sprawl that piles layer upon layer of synth and string on top of an anemic drum-track and a disconsolately muttered vocal. The duo allows Dälek's voice to push closer to the top of the mix than usual, but it remains incomprehensible as often as not. And really, that's fine, since Dälek's lyrics are mostly free-associative backpacker gobbledygook that only occasionally cohere into nice little snatches of language. The point of this stuff, after all, is the seismic drift of the composition; with three minutes left to go, the vocals drop out altogether, and a buzzing swarm of multitracked violins take their place. For a minute, chaos overwhelms the track, but then it coasts back into a pretty but uneasy swamp of warm Rhodes tones and sad, slow drums.</p><p>
    The rest of the album follows that opening track's blueprint, pitting glowing warmth against scraping noise and usually letting warmth win. On ""Paragraphs Relentless"", a constant bass-creak and an insistent sonar blip from guest DJ Rob Swift ooze gorgeously. Near the end of ""Content to Play Villain"", the synths and drums suddenly vanish and give way to a pretty jazz-horn collage. The scratched-in strings and moaning organs of ""Tarnished"" imply melody without ever quite letting it take shape. And occasionally seasick noise wins out, as on the beatless, shrieking instrumental ""Lynch,"" but even then the end result is more ambient and organic than it's been on the group's older records.</p><p>
    If Dälek didn't have all this discordant float working for them, they'd be one of the most irritating rap groups in history. Their drum tracks never venture beyond simplistic, skeletal thuds. Dälek's delivery is a half-asleep mumble, and his lyrics tend toward joyless Dead Prez agitation and stodgy old-man battle-rap full of complaints about how kids today don't understand what rap really is. But the duo is smart enough not to let that text-heavy frustration overwhelm everything else. Instead, they've drowned it in oceans of sound, and for the first time, that sound has moved toward something approaching beauty. On <em>Abandoned Language</em>, Dälek have done something with rap similar to what their old collaborator Justin Broadrick has been doing with metal in Jesu; they've melted it into an infinity of reverb and revealed an abyss of sadness. It's too easy to say that Dälek make rap for people who hate rap; it's more that they make rap for people who hate everything.</p></div>"|9968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9968-abandoned-language/|7.7|Tom Breihan

    Despite the recent surge of indie-friendly bands aiming for grandiosity, upgrading to a Big Sound is no simple matter.  Sure, many artists have lately begun to emulate the stadium-size approaches of luminaries like U2 and Bruce Springsteen, or even more recent large-venue successes like Coldplay or Pearl Jam, but few have successfully pulled off the transition.  The fact that many of these bands have yet to achieve any sort of mainstream crossover makes the pursuit even more difficult; it's hard to make arena rock when you're still playing the clubs.</p><p>
    The Frames have a bit of an edge in this regard, being massively popular in their home Ireland, a big fish/small pond status best portrayed by the cultish crowd singalongs on their live album <em>Set List</em>.  But since the group has emigrated to American label Anti-, the Frames have sought to translate their outsized stage presence into a larger album sound, first on 2004's <em>Burn the Maps</em> and now on <em>The Cost</em>.  But while seeing a band cramming XXL songs into an intimate space can be a thrilling experience (it's was one of the Arcade Fire's secret weapons on the way up), in the sterile environment of a record, shooting for majestic can just as easily result in sounding middling and generic.</p><p>
<em>The Cost</em> draws deep from The Book on Writing Epics, utilizing all the most popular strategies toward the goal of writing large-canvas anthems.  There's the song with the slow build (""People Get Ready""), the song with the really simple metaphor (""Falling Slowly""), powerful one-word song titles (""Rise"", ""True""), and many, many songs with the triumphant violin solo.  Pretty much the entire album sticks to the same contemplative tempo, and singer Glen Hansard unfurls his (considerably dampened) brogue-laced falsetto in all the right places, underscoring the real, real <em>emotional</em> parts.
    </p>
<p>
    If that whole process seems underwhelmingly by-the-numbers, you'd be right...there's very little to <em>The Cost</em> that attempts to surprise.  And while there's nothing wrong with a predictable approach when deployed with expertise, it's disappointing from a band like the Frames, whose brash energy is best depicted by the raw, immediate <em>Set List</em>.  Behaving themselves enough to conform to Big Sound ideals means sanding away their sense of humor and raucousness; only the meta-aware ""Sad Songs"" (with its tongue-in-cheek ""Born to Run"" reference) and the relatively boisterous intro to ""Falling Slowly"" let the band indulge its playful side.
    </p>
<p>
    All these compromises do yield a few strong moments of proper grandeur.  ""When Your Mind's Made Up"" executes the quiet-to-loud ramp-up to perfection, starting with some nicely entwined guitar and piano and reaching a caterwauling, electric-fiddle peak.  ""The Side You Never Get To See"" integrates orchestration without sounding forced, showing it doesn't hurt to have a full-time string-player in the band when you're going the symphonic route.
    </p>
<p>
    Yet too often, Colm Mac Con Iomaire's violin is the only element preventing the Frames from sinking to the status of just another post-Radiohead purveyor of mass-audience melancholic anthem ballads.  That's an injustice to the Frames, but one of their own making, as <em>The Cost</em> reflects the all-too-common misstep of abandoning too much of a band's unique identity in the pursuit of the Big Sound.  The enlargement process doesn't have to entail diluting a band's character in order to hit all the epic-song signifiers, as bands like the Twilight Sad and the Hold Steady have recently shown.  Unfortunately, that's the path the Frames have chosen to take, and they've paid the cost without reaching the reward.

But <em>Please Heat This Eventually</em>-- the second in an ongoing series of solo albums-- actually feels less like an indulgence to feed his pretensions than a concession to the passive Mars Volta fan (if such an animal exists) who could do without the convoluted conceptual storylines and schizoid time-signature shifts and with more straight-forward grooving and shredding.</p><p>
    Of course, in Mars Volta vernacular, ""straight-forward"" is a relative concept: <em>Please Heat This Eventually</em> is a single 25-minute jam, split over two sides of vinyl, and divided somewhat arbitrarily into six parts (denoted, as per prog tradition, with Roman numerals). And the album's guest vocalist-- Damo Suzuki-- is not one known for concision and clarity. As frontman for krautrock kings Can in the early 1970s and, more recently, with his open-door Damo Suzuki Network (<font face=""Verdana, Helvetica, Arial""><span style=""font-size: 12px""></span><font color=""#666668""><span style=""font-size: 11px"">essentially a hastily assembled band of musicians from whatever town the singer happens to be playing in</span></font><span style=""font-size: 12px""></span></font>), Suzuki has dealt not so much in lyrics as incantations that drift in and out of decipherability as the rhythm coheres and crashes.</p><p>
    And yet, <em>Please Heat This Eventually</em> is surprisingly beholden to a linear structure: After a brief 90-second prologue of synth squiggles (courtesy of Money Mark Nishita) and foreshadowing vocal fragments, the piece locks into a boisterous blaxploitation-funk rhythm track and sustains it for most of the album's duration. Though Rodriguez and Suzuki get the marquee billing, you gotta give the drummer Marcel Rodriguez-Lopez some, and even more to bassist Juan Alderete, whose steady 10-note pulse mostly keeps the piece's subway locomotion from going off the rails.</p><p>
    The opening stretch finds Suzuki-- sounding far more Cookie Monster-gruff than his more mystical Can performances-- playing call and response with Rodriguez's frenetic guitar fills, which, compared to his Mars Volta work, are more Zappa than Zeppelin. As expected, Suzuki's words are indecipherable and of indeterminate language, though they are grouped in discernible verses and choruses, the latter of which are underscored with some overdriven guitar squall. But the collaboration really starts living up to its heady promise around the eight-minute mark, when Rodriguez's playing dissolves into more droning and textural shapes, Suzuki breaks from form and enters crazy-homeless-guy rant mode, and saxophonist Adrian Terrazas-Gonazales starts squawking away, pushing <em>PHTE</em> into the same ominous environs as Miles Davis' <em>On the Corner</em> and The Stooges' <em>Fun House</em>.
    </p><p>
    This creeping tension carries over to the opening minutes of side two, after which, the rhythmic backbone finally breaks under the pressure and the whole enterprise goes down in a hail of pained guitar squeals and spasmodic sax bleats. This would seem like a logical place to end the track, but instead, Rodriguez and crew take a sharp left turn into a four-minute flute-folk pastorale. Now any monster jam like this needs to ebb and flow, but this breakdown feels particularly forced, as if the players weren't sure where to take the piece and decided to take an aesthetic coffee break instead. Throughout this lull, snippets of Suzuki's voice intrude into the mix, as if he's trying to wake everyone up. But it takes a woozy Nishita synth solo to gradually work the band up back to full strength for the piece's final minute, which summons Suzuki for one last bark through the chorus and brings the piece to a full-circle conclusion-- a tidy payoff, but one that's not quite worth trudging through <em>PHTE</em>'s drawn out second act to get there.

    Air like to let you know what kind of album you're in
    for with the first couple of bars of their opening tracks. <em>Moon Safari </em>faded
    up with bongos on ""La Femme D'Argent"", setting the stage for a loose
    and hep journey into space-age atmospherics. The ""do-do-thWACK"" S&amp;M
    whip of the drum machine opening to ""Electronic Performers"", on the
    other hand, thrust us into the stiffer, shinier, more adventurous world of <em>10,000
    Hz Legend</em>, wherein Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel sounded as if
    they'd been inhaling some of Dean and Gene Ween's Scotchgard. <em>Talkie Walkie </em>broke
    the percussion-only trend by pairing its opening beat with a strummed acoustic
    guitar and a stately piano refrain, introducing their warmest, brightest, and
    most song-oriented album. And on <em>Pocket Symphony</em>, the opening message is equally clear:<em> </em>The fluttering percussion on ""Space
    Maker"", hovering all alone, sounds like it's bouncing off hard, cold
    surfaces. Which would seem to suggest that this will be Air's quietest and most
    austere offering.</p><p>
    And so it is. There's a remarkable confidence on display
    here, that Air would choose to have their first album in three years be so
    spacious and moody, and so much less pop. They must know that they'll lose a
    few come-lately fans with music this relaxed and, well, sleepy. But the more you
    listen to <em>Pocket Symphony</em>,<em> </em>the more it becomes clear that it's
    remote by design. As they demonstrated throughout <em>Talkie Walkie</em> and on a
    few tracks per record on the previous two, Air can very capably write
    terrifically catchy songs when so inclined; here, they'd rather create
    finely-wrought furniture music. And they're good at it. Working again with
    Nigel Godrich, they've crafted what might be one of the year's best-<em>sounding</em> records, every lone piano note hanging improbably long in space and aloud
    to decay in what must be some unimaginably beautiful room.</p><p>
    My first instinct was that <em>Pocket Symphony </em>was
    the return to <em>Moon Safari </em>territory fans wanted so desperately when <em>10,000
    Hz Legend </em>first hit the shelves, but upon returning to their debut for the
    first time in a good while, that seems off. Yes, there's a quality to Godin's
    heavenly basslines that occasionally puts this record in a similar groovy
    headspace, but Air are light years from the earlier work's cheeky retro-futurisms.
    In the formal world of <em>Pocket Symphony</em>,<em> </em>a squelchy Moog would be
    considered vulgar, the unpredictability of its aged circuits no substitute for the
    absolute control of a grand piano, a finely brushed acoustic guitar, or the
    Japanese koto. Air are ready to unplug here at a moment's notice, and the space
    in which these acoustic instruments was recorded counts as an instrument in itself. 
    </p>
<p>
    Four of these dozen tracks are purely instrumental, but
    the ratio feels higher-- many of the poppier songs seem to be about arrangement
    and shading first. Jarvis Cocker chips in on ""One Hell of a Party"", his
    husky, downcast voice suiting the song's metaphor (relationship as hedonistic
    soiree to be reckoned with the morning after), and yet the frame of the song is
    so skeletal that the sentiment never gathers weight. This
    might seem to mirror the bombed-out nature of the lyric, but that's an
    intellectualization; it's ultimately just an OK, verging-on-dull song. Neil
    Hannon of the Divine Comedy sings lead on ""Somewhere Between Walking and
    Sleeping"" and the result-- muted, vaguely bland-- is again just
    serviceable. 
    </p>
<p>
    The pop songs that Dunckel sings are better suited to
    the album's frame of mind, serving more as sketches, the sort of half-written
    catchphrases that exist, in the ""Kelly Watch the Stars"" sense,
    mostly to build a chord structure around. The creamy layers of voice during the
    ""without you"" chorus in ""Left Bank"", along with the upbeat
    ""Mer du Japon""-- one of the best songs they've written and the
    album's best track-- are as close as Air get to <em>Talkie Walkie­</em>-level
    hooks. Elsewhere, it's more subtle hints and raised eyebrows than fleshed-out
    songs, whether the prickly synth and robotic swing of ""Napalm Love""
    with its three-note melody or the crisp, lightly echoed spaciousness of
    ""Photograph"", which clicks along like patent leather boots down a
    dark marble hallway. 
    </p>
    On
    every pass through the record, it seems clearer that the sound of <em>Pocket
    Symphony</em> is the album's real content. And that sound, no question, is
    exquisite. But it's also hard to hold in your head after the record stops
    playing, so <em>Pocket Symphony</em> winds up feeling strangely transient,
    accomplished and genuinely likeable but also forgettable.</div>"|9975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9975-pocket-symphony/|6.6|Mark Richardson

    At first, Marissa Nadler's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs III: Bird on the Water</span><span> doesn't seem especially notable. It's a 12-track breakup album
    detailing Nadler's pervasive loneliness, her gentle finger-style
    guitar augmented with cello, percussion, mandolin, synthesizers, and electric
    guitars. Her voice is remarkable from the outset-- a sad, husky air that climbs to
    perfect grace notes with ease-- but by the time Nadler sings, ""Oh my lonely
    diamond heart/ It misses you so well,"" 100 seconds into opener ""Diamond Heart"",
    you're pretty sure you've heard this one before.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Not so fast: As Nadler and her gorgeous,
    incredibly isolated <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs III</span><span> would have
    it, there's plenty worth waiting for. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""></span><span>Nadler doesn't want empathy for the hurt that caused her to
    write ""Diamond Heart"" in a hotel room bathtub in New Jersey or ""Bird on Your
    Grave"" for a friend who died mysteriously; she's just trying to ease some of
    that monumental pain into the next space. And-- though its micro-payoffs may come in the form of a solitary
    harmony here, a hushed mandolin chord there, or the eerie bells lending a richer atmosphere to the beautiful ""Dying Breed""-- such a feeling makes </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs
    III</span><span> one of the most focused and
    engaging singer-songwriter releases so far this year.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Of course, that can be a tough sell for folks accustomed to
    concentrated emotional whomp. Aside from its presiding atmosphere
    of pain, little about <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs III </span><span>feels direct. It peels free in slow, steady layers, Nadler's sorrow ensconced
    in impressionistic phrases and careful musicianship. As a songwriter, she's
    still painting relationship trauma in grayscale sadness, occasionally calling
    on stunning images-- ""eyes as deep as brandy wine,"" ""red-painted lips and a
    jezebel crown,"" ""breaking on the daylight""-- to better realize sullen torment.
    But that latter layer makes </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs III</span><span> much more effective than Nadler's 2005 debut, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Saga of
    Mayflower May</span><span>. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span>Nadler's a bandleader now: With
    acoustic wonderment still in place, she brings most of Philadelphia's Espers to
    bear here. They augment without distracting, building on her gravitas with
    quietly breathtaking nuance: A cymbal-scrape pallor from Otto Hauser, or </span><span>Jesse Sparhawk's </span><span>weeping mandolin; like Helena Espvall's doubled cello
    parts smeared over Nadler's ""rose-colored dreams"" on ""Thinking of You"", these
    sounds highlight the words. Even the album's loudest moment, Greg Weeks'
    piercing electric lead on ""Bird on Your Grave"", won't wow you from afar, but it</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">
    will</span><span> pull you close enough to identify with Nadler's pain. </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    As a vocalist, Nadler stretches this environment towards
    infinity: By doubling and tripling her vocals and lacing several distinct
    interpretations of one melody, she implies that her despair is now as it was
    then as it always will be. During a splendid, organ-and-guitar take on Leonard
    Cohen's ""Famous Blue Raincoat"", for instance, the narrator's desolation comes
    doubled in verses, tripled in the chorus, and chased consistently by the organ.
    Doom follows her like a rain cloud, it seems, soaking her feelings but
    powering this, her best set of songs yet. Sure, that's a mundane thing to say
    about an artist, but on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Songs III</span><span>, it's
    notable after all.</span>

No, don't raise them if
    you merely like Luna, or if you think fondly of Luna. Only raise them if you
    really, really, truly miss Luna since the group went gently into the good
    night. No? No one? Okay, a couple of hands.</p><p>
    That's not to say there's nothing to miss. At their best Luna were absolutely lovely, with Dean Wareham's sleepy songs, sinewy guitar playing
    and ""you can do this, too!"" nasal singing voice a justification for
    abandoning Galaxie 500 at the peak of their powers. But if Galaxie 500 were a
    (somewhat dysfunctional) group, Luna always appeared to be Wareham first and
    foremost, with various friends and allies grouped around him. Lest you forget,
    the first Luna album originally went out credited as a Wareham solo project
    before a proper moniker was chosen and Luna was promoted as a group.</p><p>
    Dean &amp; Britta, as the billing obviously imparts, is
    neither a group nor a solo project. Rather, it's a duo comprising Dean Wareham
    and former Luna bassist Britta Phillips, who married during the recording of <em>Back Numbers</em>, their second full-length album. In the past Wareham has cited
    the distracting romantic relationship between Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang as
    a reason for leaving Galaxie 500, so who knows? Maybe Wareham's relationship with Phillips portended the end of Luna as well.
    Over the course of <em>Back Numbers</em> the pair is abetted by a
    handful of guests (including buddy and peer Sonic Boom) plus the able hands of
    producer Tony Visconti, who produced the couple's 2003 offering <em>L'Avventura</em>.
    That disc seemed a little like a side project, not just because Luna still hung
    over Wareham's head, but due to the relatively laid back and informal nature of
    the disc.
    </p><p>
<em>Back Numbers</em>, in fact, hones rigidly close to the template
    of all previous Dean &amp; Britta releases-- a handful of originals and
    more than a handful of choice covers. But the disc also marks the sound of
    Wareham confidently moving forward, with Phillips at his side. And she is at
    his side, too: This is less Wareham +1 than it is the sound of true
    collaboration, and as such it sounds like more than just Luna minus the name. 
    </p>
<p>
    It also sounds, like those previous releases, pretty casual-- or, less charitably, pretty insubstantial. Track by track, the disc's a sweet
    thing, but as a whole it's about as light and wispy. Part of the problem is that the emphasis is mostly on the
    cover songs. Here the choice selections include ""Teen Angel"", a Donovan B-side,
    and ""White Horses"", allegedly the theme to an obscure children's TV show, each
    given an equally mellow reading. Even wild things the Troggs (as redoubtable a
    source for cover material as any) are given the comfy pillow treatment with
    Dean &amp; Britta's version of their ""Our Love Will Still Be There"". No
    surprise, then, that Lee Hazlewood's ""You Turned My Head Around"" (originally
    sung by that legendary set of pipes Ann Margret) is an early standout, if only
    because it's a song that finally nudges Britta out of her box, where she's
    allowed to belt instead of coo.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite all the standout covers, four of the album's strongest tracks are
    Dean &amp; Britta originals, albeit originals of a distinctly second-hand
    nature. ""Words You Used to Say"" (from last year's EP of the same name) is like
    Luna gone totally weightless. ""Wait for Me"" is a sleepy (naturally) waltz recycled from the soundtrack to Olivier Assayas's <em>Clean</em>, now
    featuring a resplendent turn by Britta doing her best Neko Case impression.
    ""The Sun is Still Sunny"" is a duet that grew from Wareham's <em>The Squid and the
    Whale</em> score. ""Crystal Blue R.I.P."", with Wareham on lead and a true, new
    original, is as gorgeous a track as he has ever been connected to; Wareham claims it's a eulogy for a friend's dead bunny. 
    </p>
    Yet those nice additions to the Wareham/Phillips oeuvre are
    such that one wishes the two spent a little more time working on their own
    songs than they did working on the songs of other people. Not that they sound
    like they worked that hard on them, mind you.<span>
</span>Dean &amp; Britta's good taste pushes them to cool material that does
    all the heavy lifting for them, essentially allowing them to sleepwalk through
    their own respective duties. Maybe they had a train to catch. Maybe they were
    off to their honeymoon. But given that <em>Back Numbers</em> is Wareham and Phillips'
    symbolic post-Luna debut, it sounds paradoxically rushed and slapped together
    for an otherwise dreamy affair.</div>"|9953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9953-back-numbers/|6.7|Joshua Klein

    The current, post-Libertines vogue of observational British barstool-punk is starting to feel a lot like the indie rock equivalent of reality-television, with the novelty of examining the mundane minutiae of the common bloke becoming ever more diminished by an over-saturation of low-budget bards who think they have something to say about nothing.</p><p>
    Barely out of high school, Scottish wunderkinds the View already seem late to the game, though the overly familiar nature of <em>Hats Off to the Buskers</em> probably also accounts for its recent ascent to the No. 1 position on the UK charts. The scenes here are as typical as wood paneling in a local, from the sloppy but spirited skiffle-punk clipped riffs to the thick regional accents to the live-forever anthems that valorize the working-class heroes (""Superstar Tradesman"") and weekend warriors (""Wasted Little DJs"", which in contrast to Jet's ""Rollover DJ"", actually praises the titular spinners for playing ""the same record 16 times""). But the flipside to youthful exuberance is limited life experience, and for every keen characterization (""You have a house in the Ferry/ And a new guitar/ That's never been played before/ And it never will""), there's a chorus that hinges on a throwaway line like ""Look at the streetlight/ What a pretty sight.""</p><p>
    The copious UK press comparisons to a younger, hungry Oasis are reinforced by the presence of that band's one-time producer Owen Morris, but there's a crucial difference between the two bands' debuts: Where Oasis aspired to-- and, through sheer bravado,  achieved-- a classic rags-to-riches triumph, the View seem content with just the rags. A noble stance, sure, but it doesn't make for the most compelling, inspiring rock 'n' roll. Their response to the uncertainties of the modern world is to be as proudly ordinary as possible, as illustrated by ""Same Jeans"", an agreeable folk-rock mission statement that seems destined to join James' ""Laid"" as a perennial bar-jukebox pint raiser. ""Everybody's dressing up/ I'm dressing down,"" frontman Kyle Falconer sings, and as if there was any doubting his purism, he actually punctuates the sentiment by blowing on a harmonica.
    </p>
<p>
    Like so many debuts, <em>Hats Off to the Buskers</em> is ultimately a document of a band searching for their own voice in those of others. Falconer can do Liam (""Don't Tell Me""), he can do Pete Doherty (""The Don"") and even Steve Marriott (the incongruous, sub-Stooges thrasher ""Comin' Down""). But I'd like to hear the band do more berserker punk rave-ups like ""Skag Trendy"", which is sung by bassist Kieren Webster in a voice that playfully slips and slides up and down his register as the song's tempo accelerates and lags in random fits. It's one of the few moments here that doesn't seem so beholden to a specific Britpop tradition-- and suggests the View have it in them to drop their blinkers.<br/>

""Modern"" being the operative word: They may be warmly relaxing in chthonic, sludgy sounds but what wrestles in the plastic grooves of their fourth full-length, <em>Voices of Omens</em>, is nothing less than ingenious, forward-thinking metal.</p><p>
    It'd be lazy to call them doom; that they are, but their nimble-fingered heaviness reveals something far from one-dimensional-- definitely not your typical ""tune down to B, drone 'til you're free"" doom conformists. The attack is three-pronged: One part south of the Mason-Dixon sludge à la bands like EyeHateGod and Crowbar; one part bleak and epic soundscaping in line with mid-period Neurosis and Mastodon's arching fretboard calisthenics; and one part classic funereal doom in homage to the mighty Sabbath-revisionists Trouble and the underground snail crawl brutality of Grief. To assist the ominousness of the adroit dual guitars, haunting keyboards, and slow drums, two full-on screamers-- one a bearded pudgy dude, and one a dreaded wafer-thin often barefooted dudette-- plead with the Ancient Ones via interweaving distorted howls and screeches. And sometimes, just mega-effected creepy vocal washes.</p><p>
    True stoner/doom heads will dig the sprawling track times, most around seven minutes, three over nine (!), but those who like their jams apocalyptic (especially Neurosis freaks) will have come home. The album opens with the evocatively Southern, slightly Zeppelin-y acoustic ""Intro""-- sounding like a mandolin to these ears. The prettiness stops quickly when a shriek introduces the cosmic spiral stair guitar climbs and cloaked, head-down, candle-and-moonlight processions found throughout. A surprising trick to their craft-- one akin to shouting ""Boo!""-- is an abrupt tempo change attack, usually in the form of complex and note-y Mastodon-like fractals. Frequent sprinklings of  deep-fried-and-battered Iommi solos only help matters. Besides these tempo variances one colorful dynamic is the frequent appearance of clean guitars, which either patiently build into earth-shaking stomps or nestle in the middle and in the end, like subtle red and orange fade-ins countering all of the black and gray despair.</p></div>"|9951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9951-voices-of-omens/|8.0|D.

    All those Bob Dylan comparisons that greeted Bright Eyes' previous albums
    may have prompted courteous denials from Conor Oberst, but he understood what prompted that praise. He knows we need an artist who can record
    the troubles of the times and spark activism in an indifferent populace, and
    bless him, he's trying to rise to the occasion. On the<em> Four Winds</em> EP he sets
    aside the angst-rock of <em>Lifted</em>,
    Desaparecidos, and the beatscapes of <em>Digital
    Ash in a Digital Urn</em> in favor of Neil Young-at-heart folk-rock that
    sounds like his idea of populism. He's trying to appeal to as wide an audience
    as possible. If this bid for accessibility worked well enough on <em>I'm Wide Awake It's Morning, </em>which
    debuted in the <em>Billboard</em> Top 10, it  seems to work even better on ""Four Winds"",
    thanks to Anton Patzner's fierce violin work and Bright Eyes' now permanent
    line-up.</p><p>
    Not many other singers today-- <em>maybe</em> Win Butler-- could get away with so many mentions of both the Whore of Babylon and the Great
    Satan in one song. Despite Oberst's assertion that ""the Bible's blind, the
    Torah's deaf, the Koran is mute/ If you burned them all together, you'd get close
    to the truth,"" his apocalypse is squarely Judeo-Christian in nature. But his
    lyrical imagery, obsessed as it is with the end of the world, slips easily
    between the local and the universal, the earthly and the spiritual-- drawing
    together cosmic collapse, American genocide, and squatters in an abandoned
    building creating a graffiti mural ""with 15 cans of spraypaint in a
    chemical swirl."" ""Four Winds"" is the rare protest song that actually tries to
    present an epic vision of America
    and succeeds.</p><p>
    The remaining five non-album tracks on <em>Four Winds</em> expound on the folk-rock sound of the opener, pulling it
    in different directions, but nothing else hits the mark so squarely-- or really
    at all. ""Reinvent the Wheel"" is Oberst's ""Needle and the Damage Done"", but without
    a needle, or really any damage. It's another ode to a friend, but following the
    title track, it sounds almost tediously fatuous. ""Smoke Without Fire"" has
    more gravity-- and M. Ward to boot. As Oberst draws a questionable comparison between
    inner fears with ""painted whores who won't stay the night,"" the song builds
    slowly into a Morricone epic, then ends abruptly, as if the band saw the
    nowhere it was headed.
    </p>
<p>
    As<em> Four Winds</em>
    progresses, the songs' large scope becomes shaky and Oberst's songwriting
    shakier. With its classic-rock riffs and tentative jams, ""Stray Dog Freedom""
    naively equates poverty with independence: ""We tried to name him, but he ran
    away/ Once he knew his freedom was at stake."" ""Cartoon Blues"" fares better, as
    Oberst's electronic-age ire propels the band's pounding performance. But
    he sings ""the blues"" like he's only read about them, and his story about
    sparring with a poet is unconvincing and self-aggrandizing.
    </p>
<p>
    Oberst's greatest
    asset might be his own self-loathing: Even as he lashes out about the state of
    the world, he's at his best and most compelling when he implicates himself in
    all his anger and scorn, aware that there's no other choice than to be part of
    the world but sick of himself just the same. On ""Tourist Trap"", the EP's sober
    closer, he muses that his own activism-- in the form of recording and touring
    behind angry songs like ""Four Winds""-- has left him alone and unable to enjoy the
    world: ""The road finally gave me back, but I don't think I'll unpack/ 'Cause I'm
    not sure if I live here anymore."" Times like this, everybody must get stoned.

    This is the information age, so of course it's harder than ever to find out the stuff that's really worth knowing. Dozens of blogs posted recently about the new Au Revoir Simone album, and what was my favorite discovery? A goddamn B-side. As remixed by profane London/Paris dance-poppers the Teenagers, the Brooklyn trio's ""Fallen Snow"" brings out the hidden creepiness in its wispy vocals, but you won't find its future-haunted beats on <em>The Bird of Music</em>-- though these three women do come (HOMG!) David Lynch-approved.</p><p>
    Au Revoir Simone's sophomore effort opts for the fluttering, Casio-tinted synth-pop of debut <em>Verses of Comfort, Assurance &amp; Salvation</em>, but getting past its sleepy analog atmospheres still takes some persistence. Anyway, lo-fi casualness is kinda the point; Pitchfork's Brian Howe has even called the group's music ""the anti-synth-pop to the Moldy Peaches' anti-folk"". On <em>The Bird of Music</em>, Au Revoir Simone have little trouble keeping up their offhand aesthetic. The album transcends this stylized nonchalance only when the compositions show some extra care.</p><p>
    Intrepid listeners can find the album's brightest moments on its second
    half, after the low-tempo thrum of ""I Couldn't Sleep"" (don't believe
    it) and the ""Be My Baby""-beating organ swirl of ""A Violent Yet
    Flammable World"" (future Sufjan project?). Bright, no-apologies
    dance-pop songs like ""Dark Halls"" and ""Night Majestic"" at last find
    some tunes that stick, along with some less threadbare lyrical
    concerns-- like horse races! On ""Lark"", glistening keyboards finally
    eschew the emotional detachment of the record's earlier slow songs,
    beneath an even-toned admission: ""Sometimes I want to be enough for
    you."" 
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Bird of Music</em>'s first half is a milky slog, drawing on the sparse electronics of Pipas or Young Marble Giants without the eccentricities that made those acts worthwhile. Despite a great video and sunny organ sound, the original ""Fallen Snow"" is a disappointingly tepid tale of romantic frustrations, even as it tosses off a decent line about ""women who are middle-aged with naked fingers."" Loneliness usually feels more personal. Undeterred, ""Sad Song"" perks up for Postal Service cubicle-weeping about sad songs and wanting to cry. After opener ""The Lucky One"" gets wind chimes and somber electric piano about right, it builds up to choir-like nonsense that'd make the Polyphonic Spree lose faith: ""Let the sunshine, let it come/ To show us that tomorrow is eventual."" Well, it's only a day away.

One wouldn't, for instance, have pegged Big Business as introspective types-- try reading an interview with them sometime, or with bassist-vocalist Jared Warren's old band, Karp.  The lyrics to ""Shields"" are hard to make out anyway. Some sort of advice: ""What could go wrong?"" asks Warren-- ""I can't count the number of ways.""  The third line of the song warns, ""You could still drown in knee-deep waters,"" and it's this line that stands out, since those who remember Karp remember that their old drummer, Scott Jernigan, died in a senseless boating accident in 2003.  But probably better not to make a big deal out of it, right?</p><p>
    Karp were noise-rock jokers, Am Rep gone punk-rock, the Beastie Boys by way of the Melvins and Black Sabbath rather than Led Zeppelin and Schoolly D.  Big Business, on their second album now, are instead deadpan, metal-rock cool guys, with bigger bass riffs per song than Lightning Bolt and lyrics so apocalyptic they're practically biblical: songs almost entirely about disasters or the unnerving-- stampedes, lightning, ghosts, the coming freeze.  ""He's not prepared for this, she's not prepared for this, I'm not prepared for this, we're prepared for this,"" sings Warren on ""Hands Up"".</p><p>
    So <em>Here Come the Waterworks</em> is a kind of maudlin joke, in terms of titles-- fear of the pending deluge mixed up with a joke about how we're going to have to react.  They <em>do</em> make it easy to ignore all this stuff though: Try spending any time focusing on the lyrics while simultaneously absorbing their avalanche of mountain-sized, devastating riffs.  Warren plays his instrument like a guitar, which makes sense: Karp tuned their guitars way down, so they sounded like bass anyway, plus his voice is deep and hollow, the better to match.  Stuttering phaser phrases; technicolor runs up the neck; churning low-frequency baths; you name it, it comes off Warren's bass, which twins the drums (played by Coady Willis, formerly of the Murder City Devils) in that seamless way only two-person bands ever really manage.</p><p>
    The two members of Big Business are actually <em>in</em> the Melvins now, and recorded <em>(A) Senile Animal</em> with them last year.  With that monkey off their back-- that endless aspiration to that thick, chaotic sound-- the band, on <em>Waterworks</em>, went a different production route and signed up, of all people, Phil Ek, indie-rock super-producer.  <em>Waterworks</em>, as a result, sounds gigantic, vast, and also sparklingly clean.</p><p>
    Loss, fear, and paranoia:  Opener ""Just as the Day was Dawning"", which crushed the <em>Invaders</em> comp last year, asks ""How can you sleep when you can't close the tears from your eyes,"" before merging into ""Hands Up"", which begins with one epic word: ""STAMPEDE!""  ""Hands Up"" is a sorta denim-boogie that eats up its three minutes in what feels like one or two; Warren and Willis charge forward, stutter for a chorus or two, then keep moving.  Elsewhere, like on ""Grounds for Divorce"", and especially on ""I'll Give You Something to Cry About"", their epic doom track, the band sits on a narrow point, like Floor or their successor, Torche: a couple chords, pounded into oblivion.  ""I'll Give You Something to Cry About"" taunts: ""Take your time old man/ The mountains are happy to wait,"" and then later, ""These vultures are happy to wait.""  In the background, falsetto <em>oh oh oh</em>s; let no one say this band has no sense of humor.</p><p>
    Or doubt their sincerity.  Indie rock emotional-exhibitionism is what Karp were pranking in the nineties, and with emo and its ilk making such a splash in this decade, Big Business-style reticence and obliqueness carries that much more affecting weight.  Better not to make a big deal out of a song like ""Shields"", because they don't. Just be thankful that it's there.<br/></p></div>"|9954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9954-here-come-the-waterworks/|7.9|Zach Baron

It's by no means a great record, but its best songs are uniquely hypnotic, like slo-mo takes on the eerie bedroom folk of Roky Erikson and Skip Spence. Ashley has a knack for creating spine-tingling moments out of drowsy melodies and haunting singing. After crafting two solid psych-rock records with his Bay Area band the Gris Gris, he returns to the solo realm with <em>Painted Garden</em>, an album that widens and sharpens the sound of <em>Medicine Fuck Dream</em>, but doesn't completely perfect it.</p><p>
    That's not for lack of trying. The 10 songs here are more ambitious than those on Ashley's debut, applying his reverb-drenched vocals and sleepy timing to a range of musical styles. When this works, Ashley's mix of recognizable influences and uniquely-skewed sonics is compelling. Opener ""Song From Limestone County"" is the strongest gambit: Starting with outdoor ambience, muffled samples, and strange acoustic plucks, it morphs into an aching ditty made more beautiful by Ashley's refusal to rush. As he marches stoically through the song's frozen steps, the track somehow gains intensity from tantalizing restraint.</p><p>
<em>Painted Garden</em>'s next two songs are similarly striking. ""Won't Be Long"" gathers acoustic slide and twangy plucks into a mess of catchy folk. An un-credited female singer steps in on ""Sailing With Bobby"", injecting a dreamy innocence into Ashley's baroque, bell-ringing tune. Her irresistible vocals recall Heather Lewis from Beat Happening, if she were recorded through a rainbow-lit waterfall.</p><p>
    From there, the album sags, as Ashley's songs become more generic and predictable. The loungey, piano-tinkling ""Fisher King"" and the swaying 1950s waltz ""Pretty Belladonna"" both swing nicely, but they lack the odd personality of the previous tracks, with fewer weird touches and off-road turns. In addition, Ashley's vague, disjointed lyrics, a subtle strength when buried inside better songs, seem overexposed when grafted to less-inspired melodies.</p><p>
    Ashley's idiosyncratic take on psych-folk reemerges on the album's final two tracks (not counting the tacked-on, kazoo-driven ender ""Corporation Station Agent"", oddly lifted from a Gris Gris 7""). The echo-soaked séance of ""Caroline and the Orange Tree"" is undeniably mesmerizing, and the heartbreaking ballad  ""Medication #5"" concludes with a wistful keyboard line that evokes immediate spine-chills. The album doesn't have enough of those moments to make it a consistent winner, but Ashley will hit a home run someday, and for now <em>Painted Garden</em> is a solid step toward that imminent triumph.</p></div>"|9948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9948-painted-garden/|6.5|Marc Masters

    It's hard not to root for this dude. Master carpenter
    Mark Ramos-Nishita, better known as Money Mark, rolls with the changes. At the
    dawn of the 1990s, he goes to do some work on the Beastie Boys' studio and, after hanging out, it becomes clear he knows more about playing
    music than all of them put together. So for a few years there, he's in the
    band. He's got some demos lying around that imagine what would have happened
    if Sebadoh had been into Jimmy Smith and the Sun Ra singles instead of Nick
    Drake and Joni Mitchell. Next thing you know, Grand Royal and Mo' Wax are
    putting out <em>Mark's Keyboard Repair</em> in funky multiple editions. And hey, Money Mark can sing and write catchy pop songs, too, so the
    next album, <em>Push the Button</em>, is all vocal. More instrumentals-- these
    more varied and heavily produced-- followed on 2001's <em>Change Is Coming </em>for
    the Emperor Norton label. Lately he's been jamming with a couple of the Mars
    Volta guys and some nutter named Damo Suzuki. None of this is making him rich,
    obviously; but one imagines that if the calls stop coming someday he'll be
    happy enough tinkering around with his vintage keys and dusting off the
    4-track.</p><p>
    But the calls will probably keep coming. <em>Brand New
    By Tomorrow</em>,<em> </em>like the bulk of Money Mark's output,<em> </em>succeeds
    on its own terms. It's not designed to re-arrange your idea of what music can
    be; it's meant to be listened to and enjoyed, maybe while doing something else
    you also like doing, like kicking it with friends or driving to the beach or
    organizing your records. It's another vocal album, but the
    production-- by longtime friend Mario Caldato, Jr.-- is more low-key than <em>Push
    the Button</em>. These guys aren't trying to get on the radio; most of the
    record sounds like a very well recorded demo. Reverb is almost nonexistent. A
    few different elements, most of which are played by Money Mark, are shuffled
    around and presented in various permutations: a nice slow drum groove; muted
    bass with a little stutter-step; a clean guitar working chords in tandem with
    some beautiful keyboard instruments-- Fender Rhodes, clavinet, Wurlitzer. Little
    touches here and there provide small amounts of color. Kindred spirit G. Love
    kicks in harmonica on ""Nice to Me"", a couple other tracks contain
    bits of French Horn and strings; I believe that's Brushfire label boss Jack
    Johnson doing uncredited background vocals on ""Pick Up the Pieces"", which he co-wrote.
    Add
    on top of this Money Mark's laidback singing and tuneful melodies and you get a
    loose, warm, and human-scale record that sounds pretty nice right out of the gate.
    Yes, it's easy at first to forget about when it's not around, but after a couple
    more listens a few tunes worm their way into your head and start playing back
    now and then even when the record is off, like something you heard a long time
    ago but can't quite recall. Its lack of ambition becomes, somehow, a selling
    point; you can imagine Money Mark gesturing toward his huge collection of great
    records and saying, ""Hey, it'd be pretty cool to make some stuff that
    sounds like this."" And once in a while, he gets there.<em> Brand New by
    Tomorrow</em>, probably Money Mark's best record,<em> </em>sounds out of place in
    an appealing way, reminding of a time when something this simple and direct
    could reach a large number of people. And maybe it'll still happen, who knows.
    Seems at least possible that a bunch of Jack Johnson fans will trust his
    curatorial abilities. Their faith will be rewarded.</p></div>"|9952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9952-brand-new-by-tomorrow/|6.2|Mark Richardson

Angry, embittered,      and paranoid, but often generously empathetic in their points of view, they target the government, the church, the military, the entertainment      industry, and even the basest instincts of the common man.</p>
<p>While the group's     us-against-the-world stance occasionally comes off as slightly self-righteous      or reactionary, their scathingly critical perspective gives weight      and direction to their nervy earnestness: If <i>Funeral</i> captured      the enormity of personal pain, <i>Neon Bible</i> sounds large      enough to take on the whole world. This is evident on the album's incantatory      opener, ""Black Mirror"", whose title derives from a centuries-old      device that supposedly foretold      future events and allowed viewers supernatural insight the hearts of      men. Here, the band holds that mirror up to the world and captures a      malevolent reflection.</p>
<p>Fitting <i>Neon Bible</i>'s more      worldly concerns, the Arcade Fire have streamlined the raw, large sound      of <i>Funeral</i> into something that achieves the same magnitudinous      scale through more economical means. Propelled by inventive guitar work      and Jeremy Gara's steady drums, the group pares back anything that might      curb the controlled forward thrust of songs like ""Black Mirror"",      ""Keep the Car Running"", or ""The Well and the Lighthouse"".      These songs don't erupt, but gradually crescendo and intensify. Unlike      the cathartic <i>Funeral</i>, <i>Neon Bible</i> operates on spring-loaded      tension and measured release. As such, it could strike some listeners      as a disappointing follow-up, but the record's mix of newfound      discipline and passion will likely imbue it with a long shelf-life.</p>
<p>On most songs, the Arcade Fire      achieve a headlong forward motion, bolstered by immense      church organs and Calexico horns that underscore the angst of Butler's      bitter, accusatory lyrics. Perhaps the most noticeable (and promising)      development in the band's sound is the more prominent role of Régine      Chassagne. If she once sounded studied or mannered, here her angelic      soprano projects a tentative hopefulness, making her a capable foil      for Win Butler's tense performance. Her contributions to ""(Antichrist Television      Blues)"" and ""Black Wave"" sound like the vocal equivalent      of her soaring string arrangements, co-written with Owen Pallet of Final      Fantasy.</p>
<p>These changes aren't drastic,      but they are significant, especially as they reveal new and interesting      touchstones for the band's aesthetic. The influences most commonly associated      with <i>Funeral</i> were Davids Byrne and Bowie, but on <i>Neon Bible</i>,      it's Bruce Springsteen who appears not only in the wordy songs      and aggressive shuffle, but in the compression      of so many styles and sounds into one messy, exciting burst. ""Ocean of Noise"" shuffles furtively on a      shoreline samba, due largely to Tim Kingsbury's bassline, while ""Bad      Vibrations"", sung by Chassagne, blends girl-group and new wave      performances into a darkly enticing whole. The band never compartmentalizes      these styles or consigns them to separate songs, but allows them to      blend freely.</p>
<p>Although they've expanded their sound, the Arcade Fire's transition      into extroversion isn't always smooth or graceful. <i>Neon Bible</i> is full of clunky lyrics, revealing Butler's tendency to overstate and      sensationalize. His rhyme schemes are sometimes too deliberate and set--      and <i>no one</i> should be allowed to use the sort of faux-antiquated sentence construction      that pops up in lines like ""I fell into the water black."" ""Black Mirror"" features one of the record's worst offenders: ""Mirror      mirror on the wall/ Show me where them bombs will fall."" Butler's      words, however, have always carried less meaning than the way he sings      them and the sound in which his band envelops them, so whenever a line      falls flat on <i>Neon Bible</i>, the music, always hurtling forward,      picks it up and carries it along.</p>
<p>Like many indie artists, the Arcade      Fire work best in the album format, and <i>Neon Bible</i> runs on a      different-- and in some ways more finely tuned-- mechanical system than      its predecessor. It's a shapely work, gracefully building to fall away      to build again, as the band sustains a mood that's both ominous and exhilarating. Even ""No Cars Go"", which originally      appeared on their self-titled debut EP, sounds more powerful here than it did in its previous incarnation. As stand-alone tracks,      these songs don't make as much sense, which partly explains why those      early leaks were so uninspiring. The danger here is inaccessibility: There's      only one natural entry point to <i>Neon Bible</i>, and it's ""Black Mirror"". Everything afterwards flows      seamlessly from that song's low rumble and startling imagery-- until the final track.</p>
<p>Venturing into the lyrical realm of Trent      Reznor, album closer ""My Body Is a Cage"" seems too eager to wallow in the      sort of pained melodrama that fuels the band's detractors. The real disappointment      is that <i>Neon Bible</i> doesn't end with ""No Cars Go"", which      easily achieves the release they artfully promise but playfully deny      throughout the record's first nine tracks. Not only would it have ended      the album on a more generous note, it would have made perfect thematic      sense as a final invitation to escape.</p>
<p>But despite their conflictedness , the Arcade Fire remain firmly rooted in the here and      now. And even as press coverage and fan obsession suggest that the world      is making a place for them, the band is still looking for a way to understand      that world, and to see it for what it really is-- or at least as it appears      in the distorted mirror they hold to it.</p></div>"|9946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9946-neon-bible/|8.4|Stephen M.

What he does have on his resumé-- the scores to stealth-kill video game <em>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em>, a surrealist, morbid Hungarian film about taxidermy, and a car commercial in which a group of presumably nude silhouettes contort their way into the shape of an SUV-- hints at why. Since Tobin makes no distinctions between background and foreground music and tends to wring as much distortion, dissonance, and rhythmic unease as he can from his jazz and orchestral-skewing sample sources, his music tends to evoke a  malevolent presence that, whether skulking or charging, easily overwhelms all but the most immersive and eye-catching visual accompaniment.</p><p>
    The irony in Tobin's <em>The Foley Room</em> is that his cinematic ear has spurred him toward different motion picture-derived source material. Paring down his repertoire of bop debris and Ennio Morricone/Jerry Goldsmith evocations, Tobin's assembled his newest album as if he's decided he's exhausted the possibilities of musical instruments themselves and gone outside with a microphone to find out what sort of ambient sounds would make good beats. It makes sense in that the only thing that separates the manipulated sound of a household appliance or the drone of machinery from an electronically generated percussive effect is the element of familiarity; given the way Tobin's samples tend to transmutate traditional orchestration into concussed unrecognizability, manipulating a non-musical effect into a similar state is an inevitable step, one that he initially took in 1998 with <em>Permutation </em>and has been creeping towards ever since.</p><p>
    But while other musique concrète specialists such as Matmos aim to bring specific messages to mind with their thematic choices of sound manipulation, Tobin's approach seems to aim strictly for the aesthetic-- like two slabs of raw steak smacked together to simulate a punch to the head in some 1930s radio serial, the meaning of the medium's less important than how the end result sounds. Some of the effects' usage is a bit self-aware of their non-musical origins: ""Kitchen Sink"" is just that, a booming series of splashes that sound like elastic liquid dripping into a stainless steel basin and ricocheting its way down the drain; the fuzztone in the metallic drill-n-bass of ""Esther's"" is boosted by the rumble of a motorcycle engine, ""Leader of the Pack"" style (a rumble augmented by, and this required looking up, the sound of restless wasps); the title track introduces a few clamorous mess-making tumbles and crashes, shaped into something that sounds like the collapse of a kitchen shelf set to an Art Blakey drum solo.</p><p>
    But not everything is as blatantly laid out: The Robitussin whir that ""The Killer's Vanilla"" breathes through could be anything from a slowed-down pipe organ to a creaking set of gears passed through a filter or three, not to mention the way ""Keep Your Distance"" blurs the lines between woodblock-and-cowbell percussion and what seems to be the clamor of a recycling bin tipping over. Since Tobin still uses his share of musical instrumentation (including a memorable Slavic-esque string melody contributed by the Kronos Quartet on ""Bloodstone""), figuring where the musician ends and nature or the machinery or the junkpile begins is intriguingly confusing. Supposedly there are recordings of ants eating grass and building acoustics somewhere on this record, but damned if they're easy to pinpoint amidst the beats.</p><p>
    Once the novelty of the record's field recording collage-job settles down, <em>The Foley Room</em> proves to be rhythmically consistent with Tobin's glitchy, post-jungle M.O., if somewhat exploratory; a couple moments flirt with dubstep but get too twitchy and restless to segue all that comfortably into your typical Burial track, and the broken-down carnival dance-rock of ""Always"" is just close enough to a genuine crowd-pleasing dancefloor number that it's a bit startling when the inevitable diamond-crushing load of distorted bass comes in. In the end, what makes <em>The Foley Room</em> Tobin's best album in seven years is the way his bent for organized chaos manifests as a deft control of every sound that surrounds him: Anything's a beat, everything's a break, and the difference between sound and music is entirely contextual.</p></div>"|9945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9945-the-foley-room/|8.1|Nate Patrin

The band was going to record its next album in New York, while she had plans to sequester herself in the studio to work on her own album in the UK, the follow-up to her rather Ash-y debut, 2004's <em>Grey Will Fade</em>.  That album was far from a cookie cutter effort, though-- even if insanely catchy songs like ""Summer"" and ""Bastardo"" could probably find a happy home on an Ash album, their quirks and charms would definitely make them stand out amidst the usual plug-and-chug anthems Tim Wheeler's crew is best known for.  According to all reports, the split was an amicable one, and given how fantastic <em>The Deep Blue</em> sounds, Hatherley's split with Ash was definitely for the better.</p><p>
    This album's not one to grab you by the collar and slap you silly-- that's what her first album did, kicking off things with ""Kim Wilde"", a multi-chord rumba that shares more than a few angles with XTC. On her second offering, she takes a different approach, introducing the album with ""Cousteau"", a wordless two-minute swoon, with Hatherley's dream-like cooing floating atop a sparking bed of guitars.  From there, anything's game.  There's plenty of the spunky guitar-pop she's best known for-- particularly the breathless ""I Want You To Know"" with its rolling, crashing drums and whipsmart guitar wrangling.  But then there's ""Again"", a droopy ballad bolstered by an orchestral backing ripped from a Jon Barry Bond theme; there's the tropical breeze blowing through the round-robin harmonies of ""Wounded Sky""; and there's also the shimmering, chiming ""It Isn't Over"", with Hatherley singing a sad and pretty tune-- ""Pull on your cigarette/ And you pull hard on me""-- atop flutes and sleigh bells. Album closer ""Siberia"" is a decidedly rockier song, featuring Hatherley affecting a cool detached snarl.  If you're looking for a place where these great tastes can get together, skip over to ""Roll Over (Let It Go)""-- the first half features a spot-on impersonation of the Sundays' Harriet Wheeler (no relation to Ash's Tim), while the second brings in the bright yellow guitars (courtesy of Throwing Muses)  and the rock bravado.</p><p>
    Yes, <em>The Deep Blue</em> is a trainspotter's nirvana, and Hatherley proudly wears her influences on her sleeve.  You might notice (as I did) that the bassline in ""Be Thankful"" sounds an awful lot like the bassline from the Beatles' ""Come Together"", or you might think (as someone suggested to me) that the guitar work in the album's first single, ""Behave"", sounds like what Blur's Graham Coxon did before he heard Sonic Youth.  It's a credit to Hatherley's songwriting that these little moments, vocally and musically, come off as nods and respectful homages instead of outright thefts.  She's covering a wide swath of ground on this album, from the brutish stomp of ""Love's Young Dream"", to her collaboration with XTC's Andy Partridge, the dreamy ""Dawn Treader"".  Still, the songs, um, come together quite nicely.  It's also to Hatherley's credit that she plays a mean guitar, but doesn't come off as an obnoxious guitar hero-- check out her chops on ""Very Young"", and you'll see why Wheeler drafted her into his band when she was only 18.  Charlotte Hatherley's come a long way in the nine years since then, and if <em>The Deep Blue</em> is any indication, she's only getting warmed up.</p></div>"|9909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9909-the-deep-blue/|7.8|David Raposa

    It would be wrong to call Damero's music ""womanish,"" as a couple of bloggers have seen fit, but it's accurate to call it intelligent nap music, a designation that puts this artist in line with Mira Calix, disco darling Sally Shapiro, and Damero's label dame, Ellen Allien, to name only a few female contemporaries-- and women do dominate this genre.  The reflective lyrics, soothing vocals and cushy beats of so-called INM are not exclusively dancefloor material, if at all.  The material rather coaxes fans who may enjoy dancing <em>off</em> the floor and into their own personal thought bubbles-- on a lonely velour couch in some club; in a cocoon of a bedroom or dorm; on a sweaty, breezy cigarette break.  Wherever physically, the listener is thrown out of the heightened reality of the DJ's world and enveloped in bemusement, deep breaths, level-headed reason, maybe a few tears and smiles.</p><p>
    The existence of such music annoys many for its deviation from the dancefloor to the posh, candlelit lavatory.   In the latter region is where many a sensitive music fan seizes a tangible-- nay, a furry-- form of the nightclub experience.   For those who appreciate the staples of house and techno, the music of artists like Martina Topley-Bird, Ellen Allien with her Apparat, Junior Boys, and Damero is either written off as ""easy listening,"" or, to fans, is the after-after-party, the comedown, the hair of the dog.  And no club experience is actually necessary.   Damero's debut is a perfect example of how the traits of heavyweight dance genres have been appropriated in a way that isn't invasively social, fast-paced, or requiring vertical movement.   It requires for the most part only slow, sleepy neural work.</p><p>
    This is the debut for Damero, aka Marit Posch, the sometime promotion clerk at Bpitch Control, and it shows, if only in the numerous labelmate collaborations that make up the album.  When young, up-and-coming workhorses like headkit, Zander VT and Nevis Peak appear, Posch's homespun, diaristic bedroom music is whipped through the tech house car wash-- often to delightful effect.   But the contrast to Damero's solo cuts is sharp.   On collaborations, tempos beef up, melodic layers increase in number, assonances are more pronounced, and beats oscillate in dank, strobing late-night corners.   Even the subdued ""Passage to Silence,"" Apparat’s contribution, is branded with the DJ's familiar pulsations and cute, echoed hints of longing.   The vicissitudes of industrialized drums, warm, nostalgic vocal whines, and a sad, space-age organ countermelody are the usual endearing, mournful cues-- Apparat's house call-and-responses last heard on <em>Orchestra of Bubbles, </em>his duet with Allien.</p><p>
    Damero still stands out as an individual, however, on some of her collaborations. ""Capricorn Saltlick,"" featuring labelmates Zander VT, is fully discernible from Zander's solo work: in conjunction the three artists create a sinister narrative (""I don't know your name/ I don't know your face/ But I'm waiting for you"") with slow, dripping, dark beats, a growling bass line, and a surprising, sparkling synth lead that comes in early and disappears too soon.   This full-bodied atmospheric retreat is the nexus of IDM and house and stands apart on the album, but it's one of many examples of Damero's fluidity of vision.  
    </p>
<p>
    In total, there are five such examples, and cumulatively, they tarnish the solo work, produced by fellow Berliner Henri Hagenow.  The gloss of newness and creativity is covered in too many distinct fingerprints.   The addictive ""Things Gone,"" featuring headkit, has a slapping, ornery, club-ready intro that falls away to a twinkling, static-filled minute of reflection that is all Damero's own.   Like any of the collaborations, it's a welcome addition to the album for its energetic pace, variegated effects, and general danceability, but it's a far cry from the solemnity and cloudy coziness that is Damero's solo work-- most notably, the gorgeous final track, ""I Made A Home,"" driven by a lulling classical guitar.   Showing off Damero’s exploratory zeal, her album's guests nonetheless detract from her solo numbers.   Their contributions appear to bolster Posch's own laidback aims with a broader accessibility, by way of house-bound rhythms, traditional, attentive melodies and an all-around catchiness.   The result is a hodgepodge, a colorful but disparate introductory foray from an artist whose individual evolution nonetheless deserves the public ear.<br/>

    There's a long history of talk-rock in indie, but few pursue the fusion of
    music and undirected spoken word with the zeal of L.A.'s Brendan Fowler. He
    records as Barr, and this is his second record for 5 Rue Christine. He's a
    performance artist, so he knows the art of the monologue. Between his two albums he's
    delivered many thousands of words with little regard for rhythm, meter, melody,
    narrative arc, or rhyme. He's rappin' at ya, amigo, letting you know what's
    going on in his head and commenting on his songs in real time as they unfold.
    ""I'll talk about every inch of this thing, this record/ Every square
    fucking inch/ I'll fully talk this thing into the ground..."" he promises at
    the end of the title track. The man is true to his word. He knew that line
    would wind up in a record review somewhere, and he was right. And while this
    sounds like a recipe for an unbelievably annoying record, somehow, against all
    odds, it's not. It's only a little annoying. And it's often kind of interesting,
    too.</p><p>
    The music here is far more realized than on the last Barr record, which
    helps immensely by giving Fowler's rants an emotional context. ""Rant""
    isn't the correct word, actually, and neither is ""story""; certainly
    not ""lyrics"" or ""poetry."" Part of what's interesting about <em>Summary
    </em>is puzzling over the nature of his words, trying to figure out not just
    what he's getting at, but why he bothers. Everything seems made up on the
    spot-- all the ""likes"" and ""kindas"" are intact. He stops to
    clarify, reverses himself, gets in little arguments. He tips his hat to the
    Pavement song that Barr sometimes sounds like (""In short form the conduit
    is cracked but at least it's for sale/ I'm sorry, Steve, I had to say it""),
    and then he moves on.</p><p>
    It's fun to decode, trying to figure out where Fowler is going, what sort of
    line he's following. Sometimes he becomes indie's answer to Bob Newhart,
    delivering one side of a conversation and letting the content of the exchange
    emerge slowly. Other times he can't stop talking about what is going on right
    here and now. ""You make a record at nite/ Cause everyone knows that rock
    and roll is the language of the nite/ But this got made in the day/ It was
    bright: the drums are fully shaky but the bass is more tight."" Behind him
    are simple little bits of piano, bass, drum, and guitar that provide dramatic
    underpinning. These instrumental flourishes are especially important when
    Fowler incorporates other characters into his pieces, like the messed-up person
    addressed in ""Untitled"", with whom he pleads via text exchange about
    not wanting him or her to die. It sounds overwrought, but his looseness keeps
    the melodrama in check, and the delicate piano bit is totally key to the song's
    appeal. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, as interesting as Fowler's approach on <em>Summary </em>can be, I'm not
    convinced that the record album format is the way to deliver his art. Listening
    to <em>Summary </em>sometimes feels like watching a videotape of a stage
    performance; his extemporaneous spew of words loses a lot when frozen in time
    on a CD, to be heard exactly the same way over and over. It feels like these
    stories should change a little each time you hear them, depending on his mood
    or what it looks like out the window. As is, it seems like a few times through
    is all anyone will ever need.

If you've ever attended a performance by !!! or Offer's former band, Out Hud, then you're familiar with his repertoire: the Christ-like wingspan, overhead clapping, shimmying hips, gangly duck-walking, dervish spins, scissor kicks, and humpy pelvic thrusts. It's like the mutant spawn of step aerobics,  <em>Flashdance</em>, and <em>Electric</em> <em>Boogaloo</em> in an arena-ready package: ridiculous, extravagant, and completely awesome. Offer's stage presence isn't just deeply entertaining; it's an ice-breaker that gives us permission, by example, to forget ourselves and celebrate with abandon. You can tell he's having a hell of a time, and his enthusiasm is infectious.</p><p>
    This wanton enthusiasm permeates <em>Myth Takes</em>, !!!'s most consistent album to date. They've always been polyrhythmic pop experimenters in the vein of Talking Heads or Arthur Russell, leavening guitar-and-horn driven disco-punk with adventurous dashes of trance, funk, soul, krautrock, and points beyond. Given this aesthetic dilettantism-- plus !!!'s supple rhythm section and knack for explosive hooks-- the band, on paper, seems to have developed a template that should turn out smart bangers every time. But in practice, !!!'s songwriting has sometimes struggled to keep up with their prodigious ideas. For every pitch-perfect dancefloor meltdown like ""Me and Giuliani Down By the School Yard (A True Story)"" or their take on the Magnetic Fields' ""Take Ecstasy with Me"", the band's previous albums often squandered their momentum with boggy, static grooves and bizarre tangents. I'm not one to chastise bands for ambition, even when it leads them astray, but there's something to be said for zeroing in on what you do best. What !!! does best are the incendiary disco-punk raveups that, happily, take up most of the space on <em>Myth Takes. </em></p><p>
<em></em>
</p><p>
    Any tentative or half-baked delivery is all but absent from <em>Myth Takes</em>, which rampages through the annals of kinetic music without letting genre tropes override or diffuse the songs' impact. The cerebral always takes a backseat to the visceral, and the album, while varied, is united by relentless propulsion. The title track's elastic bass and spaghetti-western guitar licks are a tense backdrop for Offer's smarmy scatting-- not to mention an effective foil to the ominous funk-laden following track, ""All My Heroes Are Weirdoes"". Mobile bass and telegraphic synths dominate the sex-jam ""Must Be the Moon"", a sort of pimp-strutting nursery rhyme for the 21+ set (""One drink, two drinks, three drinks, four!""). ""A New Name"" holds two contrasting modes in balance: earthy funk verses and a spacey soul-noir chorus that sloughs off tiny ice-chip tones, testifying to the importance of bassist and sound engineer Justin Vandervolgen's subtle tweaks. No longer experimenting for experimentation's sake, every beat-breaking decision on <em>Myth Takes</em> serves to reinforce the monumental rhythms.

    When<em> </em>the album is at its less-than-best, it's because the band is playing against its strengths. From a technical standpoint, Offer's not an amazing singer. He's terrific at sultry murmurs, yelps, and chants, and luckily, he stays in these modes for most of the album. He doesn't fare as well when he just sings, as we discover on ""Sweet Life"". For one thing, he sounds hesitant, and his outsized party-starter persona slips a bit. For another, his lyrics tend toward the absurd, and you can only get away with lines like ""sleeping underneath the blanket of dread"" if you deliver them with serious bluster. But middling memories of ""Sweet Life"" are quickly obliterated by the impossibly funky squelch of ""Yadnus"", which is also a turning point-- the album's final third sinks into relative abstraction. The last three tracks' murky digressions bring the album<em> </em>to a brainy close that's satisfying after the brawny pageantry of its front end. By sequestering the cerebral stuff that erratically peppered their prior albums to a closing come-down<em>, Myth Takes</em>, presents !!! as a band that's figured out exactly what it's good at. If they stay the course, continuing to streamline and focus, we can expect many fine albums to come.

Like their peers, the band was enamored of American black music, but made their mark by doing something different with their inspiration.  Songwriters Rod Argent and Chris White, and singer Colin Blunstone extracted the sense of mystery and loss that undergirded blues and r&amp;b, and paired it with the hushed, cool romanticism of George Gershwin's ""Summertime"" to create an alluring minor-key, noir-pop hybrid.  The initial success of ""She's Not There"" and ""Tell Her No"" didn't translate to superstardom, however, and their next chart appearance would come posthumously four years later with ""Time of the Season"", cobbled together to round out their opus <em>Odessey and Oracle</em>.  The band had been broken up for nearly two years when the song hit No. 1 in the U.S.; although it signaled a success at incorporating psychedelia into their sound, the band failed to survive the winter after the Summer of Love.</p><p>
    The nearly 40 years since their split have been very kind to the Zombies, though, with the 30th anniversary re-release of <em>Odessey</em> capping a revisionist historiography that situates the record in both the psychedelic and progressive pop canons.  Their three hits mark the beginning of the British Invasion and the end of the first wave of psychedelia, and their brief catalog is completely contained within the 1960s, only adding to the sense of nostalgia and aura.  And while the band is considered a longshot to make the white middle-class boomer canon (The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), an indie pop generation that worships the soundtracks to Wes Anderson's precious filmic dioramas has the band on its Mount Rushmore.</p><p>
    The Zombies' current incarnation is put to the test on Rhino's 2xCD <em>Live at the Bloomsbury Theatre</em>, featuring Argent and Blunstone performing on stage for the first time in three decades. Recorded in London in 2005, the set sees the pair run through 25 songs, while expanding the group's known inventory significantly.  The setlist covers hits and rarities, as well as solo efforts from Blunstone and Argent, covers, and four songs from the duo's two recent records, 2002's <em>Out of the Shadows</em>, and <em>As Far as I Can See</em>, from 2004.  Questionable song selection (especially the new material) occasionally drags down the set, but otherwise <em>Bloomsbury</em> is a highly enjoyable live record.  The band smartly sticks to the original arrangements, and more often than not proves that Argent and Blunstone not only retain their respective chops, but that their best work most definitely deserves another curtain call.  </p><p>
    The most pleasant surprise is the remarkable preservation of Blunstone's <em>sui generis</em> tenor.  He was the Zombies' Art Garfunkel, more or less, and without his voice, the concert would lack its most fundamental component.  But instead of fading away with time, it's aged incredibly well.  The initial test comes on ""This Will Be Our Year"", <em>Odessey</em>'s most poignant and hopeful song, and Blunstone recaptures the strained, boyish naïveté that made the song unforgettable in the first place.  ""A Rose for Emily"", the Zombies' own ""Eleanor Rigby"", sounds even more affecting and tender with maturity, and ""Care of Cell 44"", while definitely more earthbound than the original, still retains much of its original punch.</p><p>
<em>Odessey</em> and the early singles are well-represented, but the set is filled out with more obscure curios.  This is a welcome inclusion, if not a necessity for a band whose legacy is as much defined by its balance of classic and cult statuses.  The 1966 single ""Indication"" is offered, but without its defining middle section, a Byrdsian raga-rumble, replaced here by Argent's keyboards to limited effect.  ""Just Out of Reach"", their contribution to the Otto Preminger 1965 beat-mystery <em>Bunny Lake Is Missing</em> (in which they made a cameo) is also present, but it's overshadowed by being positioned near the end of the set.  Argent and Blunstone's love for American soul is represented with a fine cover of ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"", but ""Old and Wise"", which Blunstone sang on Alan Parsons' <em>Eye in the Sky</em>, feels out of place, if not thematically appropriate.</p><p>
    While neither are especially essential, Blunstone's solo efforts have aged much better than Argent's, and both are highlighted.  Blunstone's definitive interpretation of Tim Hardin's ""Misty Roses"" is given a six-minute, string-aided spotlight, followed by ""I Don't Believe in Angels"", from <em>Ennismore</em>.  For Argent, however, ""Hold Your Head Up"" and the Russ Ballard-penned ""God Gave Rock and Roll To You""-- despite being younger than the Zombies material-- sound dated and quaint.  ""Rock and Roll"", known more for its covers by KISS and Christian rock band Petra, is awkwardly positioned at the end of the set, following ""Tell Her No"" and ""She's Not There"", and preceding ""Summertime"".  While Blunstone and Argent might lump the song into the Zombies' family tree, its colossal level of evangelism and lunky fist-pumping chorus certainly suggest otherwise. </p><p>
    For a band that always seemed a bit out of step with their surroundings, the Zombies are taking big strides toward redefining their dimly understood catalog, aided more by a newfound appreciation by a young audience than their inclusion in the boomer canon.  And although those looking for an initial inroad into the band's discography would no doubt be better suited to check out either of Big Beat's collections-- the singles compilation or the 4xCD box set-- <em>Live at the Bloomsbury Theatre</em> is a good example of the group's enduring relevance.<br/></p></div>"|9944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9944-live-at-the-bloomsbury-theatre-london/|6.7|Eric Harvey

    but the Eternals are a band that beg for hyphens, blending any strain of underground
    genres they can crowd onto the same playground
    and make them behave. The man with
    the whistle, corralling this game of genre dodgeball is Damon Locks, former
    vocal beacon of the similarly border-blurring
    Trenchmouth, his discordant pleading over every track like a mix of Fela Kuti and Vincent Price. <em>Heavy International</em> is, more than any of their former records, a seamless blending of dub, funk, and punk, but throwing in B-movie monster-mash keyboards and stun-gun effects to create a dense, immersive listen. Their last album (2004's <em>Rawar Style</em>) offered more anthems, as any good punk/reggae band should, but there's no one with ""High Anxiety"" or anyone getting ""Shot Down (in the Middle of Division Street)"" here-- <em>Heavy International</em> is far too self-contained a universe to offer any sort of hook out of its hermetically weird world, let alone a map.</p><p>
    How odd is it? Creepy high-pitched cooing about staging a coup, sounding like a robot nursery chorus?  Check, on ""Feed the Youth (Stage a Coup)"". Herb Alpert horns underneath Locks' paranoid soapboxing about gamma rays? Check, on ""The Mix Is So Bizarre"". A cursory listen should tell you whether you'll love it or hate it, but you don't dabble with something this serious. It's not that <em>Heavy International</em> lacks melody, but it does eschew any breath of fresh air or relief. When it's on, however, the mix isn't just ""so bizarre,"" it's a righteous nerd explosion-- that song, in particular, is a storm of deep bass prods, horn stabs, and cowbell pokes. Locks has always wavered just above and below being in key, but he sounds downright uncorked here. ""Astra 3B"" is weird minimal factory-funk, mired with bongos, melancholy droids, and echoes of faraway bombs, as Locks uses his frayed falsetto to explore more personal themes. More eerie, processed vocals begin ""Patch of Blue"" over typewriter-tap percussion, before its indiscernible but memorable hook that could be guitar or keyboard, but sounds like tires skidding on ice. Aside from its finger-popping bass groove, the track is more incidental squeaks than a tune, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Even in their most indulgent moments, the rhythms are always tight and controlled.</p><p>
    Still, the thrill wears off somewhat as the tempos slow. ""Crime"" is a rolling, repetitive, slippery groove that runs far too many cycles, and there's some great moments of slimy distorto-funk like ""The Origin of the Heat Ray""; but there's also lot of sound collage and one example of meandering political musing,
    ""Too Many People (Do the Wrong Thing)"", before you get to the final
    duet ""M.O.A.B"", which isn't much of a payoff. The album is perhaps too crammed-- and if it were the length of the
    more concise <em>Rawar Style</em>, it'd be a much more potent record. Still, barring a few of their older highlights, <em>Heavy International</em> contains all your essential Eternals. It's a leap into cold water if you've never heard them, but it's the band's finest and freakiest effort to date.</p></div>"|9925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9925-heavy-international/|7.9|Jason Crock

    Musical chameleons are a common species these days, and the Florence-by-way-of-Virginia collective Tanakh should be counted proudly among their number. Ostensibly led by singer-songwriter Jesse Poe, the wayfaring group's previous four albums have (predictably enough) run an idiosyncratic gamut, ranging from dreamy renaissance folk and refracted Americana to wide-scale improvised drones. What makes their latest album <em>Saunders Hollow</em> more remarkable is that it was recorded at the same time as 2006's <em>Ardent Fevers</em>-- using the same studio, engineer and musicians-- and yet once again sounds like the work of an entirely new band.</p><p>
    The basis of Tanakh's evolution on <em>Saunders Hollow</em> is Poe's unselfish willingness to accept a supporting role, allowing erstwhile back-up singer Michele Poulos to take over as lead vocalist and chief songwriter. And though the rest of the cast from <em>Ardent Fevers</em> remains in place, this one move understandably triggers a substantial shift in the group's overall dynamic and sensibility. Backed by a returning group of collaborators that includes avant-percussionist Alex Neilson, vocalist Isobel Campbell, and multi-instrumentalist Phil Murphy, Poulos seizes the opportunity to direct Tanakh into quieter, more introspective waters. And though the album does little to further identify what could ultimately be called Tanakh's signature sound, here Poe and Poulos do strike a rare blow in favor of a genuinely democratic collaboration.</p><p>
    Any quarrels about Tanakh's stubborn lack of continuity should evaporate upon first hearing of the luminous opener ""Ladybird"". Lush with strings, vibraphone, and Campbell's ethereal backing vocals, this gorgeous track kicks off the Poulos era with a prolonged, ecstatic sigh, the full group carried along by the song's supple currents for seven time-collapsed minutes. True to form, Tanakh immediately disrupts this pastoral reverie with the following ""Marcel Proust"", whose twangy gales of guitar, fiddle and sax frame the album's closest kin to the Calexico textures of <em>Ardent Fevers</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    A brief intro of tabla ushers in <em>Saunders Hollow's </em>exotic<em> </em>instrumental title track, whose recurrent, near-flamenco guitar figures are about all that remains here of the pan-ethnic excursions from Tanakh's early work. Instead, on such tracks as the harpsichord-based folk ballad ""Longer Than Sorrow"" or the tempered juke-blues of ""Kept"", Poulos enables the group to further expand upon their reclaimed American lexicon. Agile though these cross-genre maneuvers are, however, the album's momentum buckles through its middle passages, as Poulos' voice and elusive lyrics can get submerged beneath the company's studiously eclectic instrumentation. 
    </p>
<p>
    Tanakh save their most jarring segue for last, introducing the album-closing ""Illusions of Separation"" with a three-minute breach of electronic noise and feedback that wouldn't sound too out of place on a Double Leopards album. It does sound considerably out of place here, however, but it serves to instantly draw the listener out of whatever idyllic stupor the rest of <em>Saunders Hollow</em> might have induced. Palate suitably cleansed, Poulos and Tanakh from there allow their communal music to float away on a magic carpet of violin and singing saw, their sound's natural identity more diffuse and indeterminate than ever.

    Just by tallying up his freelance work with Olivia Tremor Control and Need
    New Body, along with former band Bablicon's connections with Neutral Milk Hotel
    and Icy Demons, you can assume David McDonnell (aka the Diminisher) has
    probably accumulated his fair share of psych-pop residue. That's not to
    discredit McDonnell's talents, just to emphasize that <em>Imaginary Volcano</em>,
    McDonnell's first album as the Diminisher, is hardly a green debut from some
    guy off the street.</p><p>
    Fact is, the Diminsher, who received his nickname from his Bablicon
    bandmates, slaved away three years on <em>Imaginary Volcano</em> while between
    tours and side projects. As a result, <em>Volcano</em> may not be the most
    cohesive album, but it makes up for it in meticulousness. While the E6
    propinquity shines through on a lot of tracks, McDonnell proves hard to pin
    down stylistically. Like Of Montreal's newer material, there's a psychedelic
    baseline, but genres are constantly compounded as McDonnell piles on additional
    electronic parts. Likewise, McDonnell knows when to hedge the sonic mêlée and
    let his crafty melodies take center stage. As a vocalist, however, McDonnell's
    no Kevin Barnes, harkening back instead to the even-keeled British croons of
    Paul McCartney or Ray Davies.</p><p>
    For all the press kit depictions of McDonnell as a mad scientist conducting
    psychedelic experiments in some lab, his songwriting feels very deliberate, and
    the hooks very blatantly grab the ear. ""Brooklyn's Sinking"" and
    ""Snail Song"" sound like moody Beatles songs, bouncing across
    arpeggiating keyboard lines and charming melodies. ""A Subtle Sign""'s
    obsessive piano hook resembles trippier Rolling Stones albums like <em>Between
    the Buttons</em> and <em>Flowers</em>. Occasionally McDonnell ventures out of this
    1960s sound, such as on more finely produced tracks like
    ""Trainstation"" and the title track. Even with their playful mod
    leanings though, the songs maintain McDonnell's steady clip of hooks.
    </p>
<p>
    Rounding out <em>Volcano </em>are McDonnell's more cerebral tracks, which
    transmogrify the album's catchy NyQuil trip into a full-fledged LSD romp.
    ""Timshael"", which nearly shares a name with <em>East of Eden</em>'s
    life-affirming mantra, skitters over a winding harpsichord pattern that almost
    sounds backwards while McDonnell's impressionistic vocals wander in and out of
    the mix. The journey grows weirder by album's end, finishing with the one-two
    punch of the Radiohead-influenced ""Dreaming in Asheville"" and
    cinematic strings-only closer ""A Building Named Lucille"". Although
    McDonnell flexes some ambient muscle here, these far-out snippets only scratch
    the majestic surface of what this album could become. For all its nifty
    songwriting, <em>Volcano</em>'s still just a bedroom album staring out its window
    at more magical lands, though it attests to McDonnell's potential for a much
    more transcendental album down the road-- should the guy ever find the time.

The band's debut album,  <em>Employment</em>, and its proletarian bent sounded like a recipe for the broadest appeal possible: The Chiefs occasionally shared Jam-isms with the Futureheads, and could wank out a power ballad like Bloc Party, but their appeal was geared toward a larger audience than their art-school counterparts.   The rhythms were just as foregrounded, but drawn more from pub-rock and Britpop than Josef K and Joy Division, with banged-out piano runs and ramped-up choruses replacing chippy guitars and watertight drumming.  And it worked-- the album sold more than 1.75 million copies in the UK alone.</p><p>
    With a bit of distance, <em>Employment</em> certainly sounds like a debut record from a band rushed into the spotlight.  They had the energy and enthusiasm of a group of soldiers on a weekend furlough, with Ricky Wilson leading a series of sing-alongs and sappy-but-heartfelt ballads.  It was far from great album, but the simmering violence of ""I Predict a Riot"" and infectiousness of ""Na Na Na Na Naa"", ""Everyday I Love You Less and Less"", and ""Oh My God"" got the Chiefs bracketed with British ancestors such as Small Faces, Madness, and Blur.</p><p>
    Well, if <em>Yours Truly, Angry Mob</em> is any indication, the party's over.  It's perhaps not surprising that the band is unable to keep their <em>Employment</em> energy level intact, but <em>Mob</em>'s level of cynicism seems a bit of an overcompensation, as if the second record is an extended dreary hangover from the drunken escapade of the first.</p><p>
    First single ""Ruby"" starts the album on an upbeat note, though it fails to pack much of a punch.  Essentially a repackaged summation of <em>Employment</em>'s dynamism, ""Ruby"" pauses ever so slightly before hitting its simple, repeated refrain, ostensibly to increase its potency on impact.  But despite their best effort, there's only a small pop instead of an explosion.  ""The Angry Mob"" raises the stakes a bit, alternating clenched-teeth dares with limber capitulations, resulting in the album's most enjoyable song.  Wilson attempts to force a barroom competitor into independent thought: ""You're winding yourself up until you're turning blue, repeating everything that you've read,"" before giving up: ""It's only 'cause you came here with your brothers, too; if you came here on your own you'd be dead.""</p><p>
    If ""Mob"" ended with that bit of resignation, it would be fine, but the coda brings the groans, explaining the titular mass not as rowdy bar patrons or concert attendees, but <em>society itself</em>:  ""We are the angry mob, we read the papers everyday/ We like who we like, we hate who we hate, but we're oh so easily swayed.""  Wilson was fine as a casual observer on <em>Employment</em>, and <em>Mob</em>'s occasional, vague forays into social comment certainly illustrate that he'd do well to avoid too much editorializing.  The Buzzcocks-referencing ""Everything Is Average Nowadays"" mines similar territory (""everyone is sitting on the fence""), yet the band didn't get the message that they weren't supposed to prove their claim by illustrating how blandness sounds.</p><p>
    Wilson's preoccupation with failed (and failing) romantic relationships continues with ""Love Is Not a Competition (But I'm Winning)"" as the logical followup to <em>Employment</em>'s ""Everyday I Love You Less and Less"", the sentiment from which was properly identified on this Web site in Joe Tangari's <em>Employment</em> review as barely concealed pining.  ""I Can Do Without You"" is a half-hearted attempt at self-encouragement, and Wilson's not too sure he'll succeed, following the refrain with ""but it won't be very good.""  The self-hatred is capped on ""My Kind of Guy"", where Wilson abandons the ladies and finds a partner in despair, one who ""sounds as horrible"" as he does.  </p><p>
    The central flaw of <em>Mob</em>-- and it's a profound one-- is that its attempt to refine <em>Employment</em>'s boundless levels of boyish vigor with introspection and intellect comes across as tired and bored.  If he cared a whit about subtlety or nuance, Wilson could wrench deeper meaning from his pithy observations.  Of course, he doesn't, which was fine when the band was content to wallop the listener over the head.  But On <em>Mob</em>, he's clearly trying for something more, yet seemingly unaware that he's caught in a rut.  He accidentally explains it best in ""Thank You Very Much"" (itself a pale retread of ""I Predict a Riot""'s rhythm bed): ""This should be a thrill, but it feels like a drill.""<br/></p></div>"|9949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9949-yours-truly-angry-mob/|5.0|Eric Harvey

If you couldn't tell from LCD Soundsystem's liberal treatment of the conceit on their <em>45:33</em>, it's made plain from the first 15 minutes of <em>All Day</em>, Aesop Rock's contribution to the series and the third overall. There's an apt warmup built from watery keyboards, gently-prodding fingersnaps, and a sparse, thudding downbeat-- the kind of preternatural mid-tempo magic that could sync with every meeting of sneaker sole and pavement. Aesop Rock only gently reminds us he's there while we're distracted by incidental Bomb Squad-esque squeaks and tin-can funk guitar patterns, but by the 13-minute mark, we're already cooling down, and voice, guitar, and drums grow sluggish like a Walkman on its last bit of battery power. This is intended either for a very untrained, very stoned exerciser, or it's less for a workout and more for Aes Rock's driving commute.</p><p>
    Again, not that this matters, or at least it doesn't have to-- James Murphy attacked it like an artistic challenge, a box he had to work his way out of, and it pushed him to unexpected heights. <em>All Day</em> doesn't fare so well, possibly because Aes is better at the sprint than at pacing himself. He claims to have made the track hoping that ""the sound was constantly fresh and attractive, as if the runner were moving through a set of differing cities or landscapes."" The ""different city"" thing would have been a great idea if executed differently; before hearing it, I imagined hearing hints of different regional flavors (Southern, West coast, Bay Area, choose your own incongruous adventure and insert here) that would push Aes' unique voice and style into new contexts. Of course, that's not what we get, and he probably meant he just wanted something that would hold the ""runner's"" attention. We don't even get that. This extended track  ends up rather homogeneous, stretching Aes' anemic brand of gritty NYC funk dangerously thin over the course of 45 minutes.</p><p>
    The drums often feel canned; the busier, tougher beats are diluted by keyboard parts that are awkward and unimaginitive; and the omnipresent guitar parts are more inventive but often sound out-of-place. Aesop himself continues to slow down and make his syllables count rather than cramming them like he was getting paid per word, as he did on the <em>Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives</em> EP, where he bridged the gap between the denser, stranger production of <em>Bazooka Tooth</em> and the classical-sampling coffeehouse leanings of <em>Float</em> and <em>Labor Days</em>. He even produced some pretty good beats on his own from the <em>Fast Cars</em> EP, too, making <em>All Day</em> even more of a head-scratcher. But when he does rap here, which isn't often, he's half party-rocking MC, half personal trainer, just repeating a few key phrases that dart in and out between the beats like a runner's mantra. Whether the lyrics are apt for exercising isn't the point; it's the rhythm of his words that push the track forward when the energy lags (at any rate, lines about paper-bag disguises are better than hearing ""shame on you"" over and over again). His laconic, unhurried approach is one of the few things that work on <em>All Day</em>, leaving me anxious to hear his next project, so long as he doesn't produce the entire thing himself.</p></div>"|9933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9933-all-day/|5.9|Jason Crock

    Here's a shocking fact: 2007 marks the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the compact disc. Considering how record companies love to sell you the same album multiple times, that's a bizarrely long tenure for the newest music industry-approved technology.  Because the CD refuses to yield the throne to any other physical formats (DVDs? Minidiscs?), labels have long been forced to find other ways to repeatedly plunder their catalogs, most notably by releasing remastered and expanded versions of any album that was reasonably successful.  In some cases, the cleaned-up sound and snazzier packaging of these records corrects lazy, negligent editions released in the CD's early days, but more often it's just a case of shaking loose change out of the couch cushions.</p><p>
    That's not the case with Electric Light Orchestra, subjects of a lengthy restoration project that has reached <em>Out of the Blue</em> in time for its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary.  ELO may not immediately seem like an essential part of music history, but there's no denying they're a band well served by the fancy frills that accompany a reissue.  For starters, ELO records hearken back to an era where album art meant Awesome Fucking Spaceships, and <em>Out of the Blue</em> has an especially fine one that resembles a cross between a jukebox and the old Simon games.  It's a disservice to shrink such a cover down to CD-size packaging, but the reissue compensates by including a build-it-yourself punch-out space needle thingy and pictures of the band's ridiculous spaceship stage-set.</p><p>
    More importantly, ELO records respond well to remastered sound, due to the band's entire aesthetic being based upon Jeff Lynne using approximately 250 tracks of instruments and vocals in every song.  <em>Out of the Blue</em> is often thought to be the band's high water mark because, in many ways, it was the culmination of Lynne's ambitious original mission to blend rock'n'roll with orchestral flourishes, his presumptuous effort to ""pick up where the Beatles left off.""  By this, his seventh album, Lynne had developed the idea far beyond the cheesy primordial mashups like his ""Roll Over Beethoven"" cover (excepting the silly throwback ""Birmingham Blues""), and had even reached past the increasingly restrictive borders of 70s rock to embrace treble-heavy elements of the rising disco sound like liberal uses of falsetto, arcade synths, and melodramatic strings.  
    </p>
<p>
    Prophetic anticipation or dumb luck, <em>Out of the Blue</em> hit the zeitgeist jackpot in 1977, coming out within a month of <em>Saturday Night Fever</em> and reflecting, if not true disco, a perfect crossover gateway-drug to piggyback on the explosion of their fellow rock defectors, the Bee Gees.  Though ELO's finest singles may have appeared on the two prior albums (can you argue with ""Evil Woman"" or ""Livin' Thing""?), <em>Out of the Blue</em> has its share of greatest hits regulars sprinkled across its four vinyl sides: ""Turn to Stone"", ""Sweet Talkin' Woman"", ""Wild West Hero"".  The side C four-song suite ""Concerto for a Rainy Day"" (god bless the 70s) even includes the triumphant ""Mr. Blue Sky"", deservedly exhumed in the past few years by the hipster cognoscenti as a perfectly weird slice of gaudy, over-the-top FM-dial pop.
    </p>
<p>
    The deep cuts on <em>Out of the Blue</em> also hold their own alongside the hits, enough so to justify the double-album expanse (though its 70 minutes are routine by today's CD-enabled standards).  ""Across the Border"" finds a way to cram mariachi horns into Lynne's already packed palette, and most of ""Concerto for a Rainy Day"" is an argument for art-rock excess, from the Boston-esque organ arpeggios of ""Standin' in the Rain"" to the army-of-Lynne choir that marks the balladic ""Summer and Lightning"".  Lynne's symphonic addiction may be the kind of bloat punk was meant to eradicate, but it's hard not to appreciate his compositional skill, the ability to arrange string parts that do much more than merely play the song's chord progression, instead offering rich melodic counterpoints.
    </p>
<p>
    This sharp learning curve makes it difficult for too many indie artists to draw lessons from ELO's successes; even if a songwriter possesses Lynne's orchestral skills, it's a pretty cost-prohibitive embellishment for most small-time acts.  But other elements of the ELO sound are ripe for harvest, as shown by the Lynne-esque overdub-crazy vocal methods used on recent records from Of Montreal and Scissor Sisters.  Maybe the best lesson from ELO's career is a more general advisory to let your ambition run wild, a topical piece of advice when everyone from My Chemical Romance to the Arcade Fire are currently aiming for stadium-size grandiosity with their own records.  Calling in the string section and commissioning the spaceship cover-art may be a big gamble, but <em>Out of the Blue</em> is proof of how good it can sound when the grand approach works-- and gets the loving audio quality makeover it deserves.

    Hailing from Kentucky, Mittens on Strings are a funny band, but they're not a jokey band. The laughs on their debut, <em>It Is Becomes Disaffect Toward the Present World, Look Up the Sky!!,</em> catch in your throat as they detail the frustrations of corrupt politicians, extraterrestrials, and indie rock musicians. ""The Most Complete Skeleton Ever Found"", for example, is a standout track sung from the point of view of a tiny dinosaur tormented by larger, fiercer lizards. He lists the bullies with the surly attitude of a dweeby freshman: ""brontosaurus... stegosaurus... dimetrodon... you know they're all just jerks,"" human Alex Preston sings. ""The brontosaurus is only going to fuel a Ford Taurus."" Longing for the consolation of a museum afterlife, he repeats the line ""all the kids will love me"" as the band pounds out prehistoric brood-rock with a dejected lumber, revealing greater depths than the concept might suggest.</p><p>
    Mittens on Strings volleys between two seemingly opposite musical poles, neither of which lends itself to much levity. The snare-led ""G.I. Dirt Races"", the pity-party starter ""Badge's Folly"", and the mournful, meandering closer ""Last Shot"" churn up college-rock melancholia, with Preston's deep tenor wrenching the songs for maximum mope. ""Enter Mothership"" and ""Confrontation"", on the other hand, saunter by with a low-key country-rock shamble that incorporates mandolin and pedal steel. One gets the sense the band gravitates to these styles because they're easy to play. That's certainly not a criticism: As their name suggests, Mittens on Strings downplays technical proficiency in favor of a rascally DIY amateurishness that prevents these songs from straying too far into goofy or grave territory.</p><p>
    As a result, <em>Look Up the Sky!!</em> manages to create and sustain a brand of irony that somehow implies connection and investment rather than detachment and distance. Mittens on Strings' characters are outsiders who remain sympathetic even as their desperation lends itself to dark humor. On ""G.I. Dirt Races"", a runner sprints so fast that no one can see him cross the finish line. The narrator of ""Confrontation"" dreams of shooting straight maple syrup into his veins to stop his heart. On ""<hr/>"" (that's the real title), a rejected lover burns the remnants of a relationship, then pees out the fire. Addiction-- or ""chess with drugs,"" as Preston calls it on ""Badge's Folly""-- is a recurring theme, one that sounds realer than fiction. That the band takes these characters and situations seriously lends these songs a considerable gravity, which makes this tongue-twister-titled album familiar yet inventive, smart-ass yet endearing.

    Indie rock blogs and message boards are arenas where cynical witticisms
    carry more weight than well-reasoned ideas. At a time when most indie bands
    seem to choose their names as neat-sounding promotional tools and not as
    artistic choices that have a direct relationship with their music, it's more
    important than ever to choose a name that can't be easily turned against you.
    If the trio of Australians in Love of Diagrams doesn't care about this stuff,
    then they've got good heads on their shoulders. If they do, they've chosen an
    unfortunate moniker, wide open to readymade jibes. Their self-titled Matador EP
    can be fairly assessed as a diagram of the UK post-punk epitomized by Gang of
    Four and PiL, with a dash of Siouxsie in Antonia Sellbach's terse bark.</p><p>
    I'd be as happy never to write the words ""Gang of Four"" again as
    you'd probably be not to read them, but to discuss Love of Diagrams without
    mentioning them leaves an awfully large elephant lurking tacitly in the room.
    This EP has more acute angles than a trig exam: Off-kilter bass rumbles,
    guitars stab and echo with a metallic sheen, drums pound and skitter, anxious
    voices call and respond, and dub allusions proliferate. It's a full-bodied
    solution that enjoys the bottom-layer density (courtesy of a muscular rhythm
    section) and top-layer effervescence (represented by fizzy bursts of guitar) of
    a well-poured glass of beer, and its physical effects are just as reliable.</p><p>
    The first two tracks were recorded by Bob Weston, who did a great job of
    capturing the power of Love of Diagrams' rigid foundations and malleable
    melodies. The gruff sloganeering of ""The Pace or the Patience"" cycles
    seamlessly between a jerky swagger and a fluid sprint, only relenting for the
    mandatory dubby section with droning chants and skittering drums. Sellbach
    explores a more colorful melodic range on the sinuous ""The Pyramid"",
    where chaotic yet lyrical guitar workouts border spacious verses. ""Cool
    (Live)"" is a cover of a twenty-odd-year-old song by Athens, Georgia's Pylon, with
    sharp-edged guitars and sturdy drum rolls that fit snugly amid the original
    material.
    </p>
<p>
    ""No Way Out"" is an older unreleased song, one implying that the
    band is moving away from twitchy toward something more stately-- which means
    that despite the familiarity of their sound, they aren't stagnant. There are
    musical sins much graver than derivativeness, and Love of Diagrams have met
    what seems to be their goal: to resurrect the still-awesome power of classic UK
    post-punk for the umpteenth time. But the EP's visceral thrills are accompanied
    by the nagging frustration that, out of the countless ways you can combine guitars
    and drums, so many bands are choosing this exact one.

    Johnny Cash's late-career rebirth has few parallels in modern pop history. But it's remarkable nonetheless that in 2006, three years after his death, Cash's five million records sold in the U.S. made him the year's second-most successful artist, right behind Rascal Flatts (but, satisfyingly, well ahead of Nickelback).</p><p>
    That's a pretty big number-- twice Justin Timberlake's tally-- but somewhat explainable. 2005's <em>Walk the Line</em> helped solidify Cash's status as a great American icon, just as a steady stream of Rick Rubin-helmed comeback discs demonstrated his powers had barely been diminished by age and illness. Cash was one of the few acts that everybody-- young and old, cool and conservative, country or pop-- could embrace.</p><p>
    Those numbers being what they are, though, don't expect the Cash releases to slow down anytime soon. In the past few years alone, Cash has inspired new career-spanning boxed sets, best-ofs, expanded live albums, June Carter Cash duets, and <em>Personal File</em>, a collection of unreleased demos. Following 2006's at the time allegedly ""final"" <em>American V: A Hundred Highways</em>, Rubin has even announced a sixth volume of the series.</p><p>
    Now comes <em>Ultimate Gospel</em>, a collection of Cash's spiritual work. Cash had been recording gospel material from the start but particularly throughout his later years. Most recently he completed the moving <em>My Mother's Hymn Book</em> as part of the <em>Unearthed</em> boxed set (it was subsequently re-released as a stand-alone set), songs his mother once sang that Cash took with him (both literally and figuratively) everywhere he went. Even when his longtime label Columbia occasionally lost faith in the marketability of gospel, Cash kept cranking out the discs at semi-regular intervals, jumping ship to smaller labels when need be to get the music out.</p><p>
    Lately, gospel-- not to mention fundamentalist Christianity-- has been experiencing something of a renaissance, so it's no shock that the same label that sometimes frowned upon Cash's religious recordings is eager to revisit them today. But times are different. Big music names from Bono to Mary J. Blige to Arcade Fire are believers of the highest order, but they generally get a free pass from all but the most staunchly secularist followers of Richard Dawkins. Besides, Cash's own born-again story is perfectly in line with the singer's other mythic American, larger than life tales: In 1967, hopped up on speed, Cash crawled into Nickajack Cave and prepared to die, until he felt the hand of God point him to salvation. He married June Carter the following year and lead a life of devout Christianity until his demise.</p><p>
    Yet Cash's relationship to God was complex (as non-Christian friends like Rubin would later attest). He believed, but he didn't always believe what other believers believed. For Cash, religion was strictly personal, and recording gospel was part of his own ongoing rehabilitation, a way to reconnect with his roots and keep him spiritually focused rather than simply a means to draw converts. That's one reason Cash was never branded a Christian artist per se, even though <em>Ultimate Gospel </em>includes explicitly Christian music, a little more than half of it traditional, which he'd been recording since the 50s.</p><p>
    Starting with a live 1970 Grand Ole Opry take on Johnny Bond and Tex Ritter's ""Here Was a Man"" may be conceptually sound, but it drags on at under three minutes and paints Cash as something he wasn't: a bore. Likewise, the next track, 1971's ""The Preacher Said, 'Jesus Said'"", a partly spoken-word collaboration with Rev. Billy Graham, comes off kitschy despite its clear convictions.</p><p>
    That's the thin line <em>Ultimate Gospel</em> walks for most of its duration. It's music for the devout, sure, but it can also be corny. Not coincidentally, Cash's <em>Ultimate Gospel</em> is being marketed alongside an Elvis Presley <em>Ultimate Gospel</em> collection, underscoring the seldom-spoken connection between the two former peers. Both remained icons throughout the 70s, but musically they were each pretty moribund.</p><p>
    Needless to say, the best tracks on <em>Ultimate Gospel</em> are those that show Cash at his (first) peak, either recording in the 50s with the Tennessee Two or the 60s with the Carter Family (though 1968's ""Daddy Sang Bass"" is a questionable gospel standard). By the 70s, even as country grew more fashionable, Johnny Cash grew less so, and the songs from that decade included here-- like ""Far Side Banks of Jordan"" or a lite-fare version of the generally redoubtable ""Amazing Grace""-- are notable only for their ordinariness.</p><p>
    It took another couple of decades for Cash to get his mojo back, with albums more gripping, creative, and spiritually stirring than a lot of what's repackaged here. Fittingly, as Cash grew older and sicklier, his religious songs packed more weight than many included on this comp. ""Spiritual"", from 1996's <em>Unchained</em>, marks one of Cash's greatest vocal performances, and ""When the Man Comes Around"" and ""God's Gonna Cut You Down"" (from volumes four and five of the <em>American</em> series, respectively) are as fervently, feverishly apocalyptic as anything Cash ever recorded.</p><p>
    Besides, the struggle between his better nature and his demons was the dramatic conflict that often made Cash so compelling-- ""The Beast in Me"", former son-in-law Nick Lowe's contribution to the <em>American Recordings</em> disc summed it up pretty well-- and listening to a set composed strictly of spiritual songs sacrifices much of that drama for the sake of (ironically) marketing. But what's God without the Devil? What's to be gained from listening to the devout preach to the converted without getting the other side-- damnation, the cost of giving in to temptation? Listening to Cash embrace his innate goodness isn't a bad trip by any stretch, but that innate goodness is only a small part of what made Cash great.<br/>

    If there is one common characteristic in the archetypal Kompakt sound, it's the practice of making dance tracks sound as if they're moving at several different speeds at once. This is the reason why Kompakt ambassador Michael Mayer is associated as much with heavy-lidded deep-hour sway as he is with peak anthems. The sleight-of-speed phenomenon has been easy to identify in the years since the Kompakt sound grew big and momentous, but it goes all the way back to the beginning, in 1998, when ""minimalism"" meant not only distilling sounds down to their essence but also reevaluating the prescribed effects of those sounds as they were employed. If a formative Kompakt track trafficked in nothing more than clicks and taps, that didn't mean it was necessarily rhythmic in nature; by contrast, if another track was all beatless hums and smears, that didn't mean it didn't move.</p><p>
    Gui Boratto is a sleight-of-speed master, another name to add to the list topped by Superpitcher, Matias Aguayo, and anybody who ever made a schaffel track that transcended its novelty roots in glam-rock. It's tempting to attribute Boratto's touch to the fact that he's Brazilian-- what is Brazilian music, after all, if not dispersive and diaphanous even in its most antic modes? But Boratto's South American roots don't grow out like those of Chlieans Ricardo Villalobos or Luciano; he doesn't play with hand-drum runs or toy with wooden timbres. Boratto is more like Aguayo in the way he calls on big, trancey sounds and sets up enough space between them to let elision create arrangements on their own terms.</p><p>
    Boratto's inversion of speed and momentum played out in the track that made his name in the techno world: The <em>Total 7 </em>highlight ""Arquipélago"", which traffics in fleet hi-hat syncopation and a languorous synth line that trails far behind the action. The tug-of-war makes for a brooding kind of tension, and it's most noticeable when the war itself is over: About 3/4 the way through, the synth line falls out and the rhythmic patterns at work are literally catapulted forward in its absence.</p><p>
    That kind of ploy is at play all over <em>Chromophobia</em>, one of the three or four best artist-albums to bear the Kompakt stamp. ""Scene"" starts with a series of ambient trance ruffles, but from there it's all about concision and textures that creep into the folds and crevices, sounds you have to crane to notice otherwise. ""Terminal"" and ""Gate 7"" roll over tripped-up mid-tempo beats that measure as anything but mid-tempo, thanks to staccato synth riffs that yank them forward, while glacially patient backgrounds push them from behind. You can follow the highs for a glimmery rush, settle into the lows for a moody lull, or get lost somewhere in the middle to luxuriate in Boratto's sweet-spot.</p><p>
    It's a testament to the allure of Boratto's control that a song as whooshy and anthemic as ""Beautiful Life"" plays as a strange sort of liability in context. It's the lone song on <em>Chromophobia</em> with vocals-- dreamy female vocals about living life and seeing the sun that could cap an epic Felix Da Housecat album-- and it sounds out of place among a few mesmerizing but ill-suited epilogues tacked on near the end. Would that more missteps stepped so correctly, but <em>Chromophobia</em> is more about the subtle declarations of tension and release in a track like ""The Blessing"". It's an articulate mess of snare fills over a hi-hat that sounds simply happy to be there, and a slow, moody bass-line that won't be swayed to smile by any carnival happening off in the distance. It moves at several different speeds while sloughing off the impulse to pick just one.

    No matter how much my tastes change or how many different types of music I
    discover, I always make room for a good rock record. The feeling inspired by a
    sharp riff and a big, grabbing melody is always welcome. There's a ton of that
    on <em>Modern Currencies</em>, Uncut's second album and a worthy follow-up to 2004's
    outstanding debut <em>Those Who Were Hung Hang Here</em> (don't believe All Music
    Guide-- two of the four albums they list are by completely different bands
    named Uncut). Around that time, they were pegged as the Toronto chapter of the
    post-punk revival or, more lazily, a Canadian Interpol.</p><p>
    The latter label wasn't really fair or accurate, though the two bands do
    share a knack for propulsive tunefulness. It's even less accurate now, as the
    quartet's sound has grown measurably since the debut. They're sharper and less
    reliant on sheer volume to make an impact, though the band's self-production
    still keeps the needle in the red most of the time. They've also added a
    songwriter from within, as bassist Derek Tokar has taken up the pen alongside
    guitarists Ian Worang and Sam Goldberg. And they managed to rope in
    ex-Hole/Smashing Pumpkins bassist Melissa Auf der Maur for some backing vocals.</p><p>
    The record opens with a massive guitar hook that plays against Worang's
    sing-speak vocal. It's odd-- he doesn't even sing the chorus to
    ""Darkhorse"", instead delivering the line ""Let's just kill all
    the living/ They're not all made to live"" in an oddly memorable chant. The
    band's three writers have distinct, complementary styles, a la Sloan, Fugazi,
    or the Beatles (comparing methods here, not music). Worang tends to write his
    biggest hooks into the guitar parts, delivering lyrics in a reserved tone that
    borders on speech while the rhythm carries him. Goldberg's approach is just the
    opposite; he's the purest singer in the band, and there's a satisfying tension
    between his soft delivery and the thunderously loud music around him. Tokar
    falls somewhere in the middle, with a tendency to set things spiraling at an
    extremely high tempo and thread his gentle vocals through it all. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's hard to pick a standout from this batch of songs-- it's an album where
    it depends on which song you're listening to at the time-- but Goldberg's
    ""Kiss Me"" is as good a candidate as any, with its chiming guitar
    melody and counterintuitively hushed vocals. Goldberg and Auf der Maur sound so
    natural together that it's difficult to even notice at first that they're both
    singing on ""Never Say Never""-- it almost sounds like double tracking.
    The band saves the three quickest tempos for the record's last third, unleashing
    them in a row before splashing down into ""Prison Waltz"", which
    features a guest vocal from Ndidi Onukwulu and ends the album with the guitars
    groping skyward. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's tough to find much to fault on <em>Modern Currencies</em>, but while it's very
    consistent in quality, it can also be over-consistent in tone and overall sonic
    character; all those soaring, searching guitars can bleed from one song to the
    next. As weaknesses go, though, a band could certainly do worse, and this is an
    album I can certainly see myself finding time for in the future.

This new album nearly summarizes the band's career thus far, shining light on unmined and forgotten (sometimes for good reason) sounds and genres from the not-too-distant past but forgoing most of their less-advisable indulgences. There's still moments that one could flag as cheesy, but those spots aren't executed with the same tongue-in-cheek humor as on their recent work. It's more like an alternate-universe 1980s, with more technical flair, studied patience, and a modicum of better taste.</p><p>
    You may have heard the rubbery bass notes and ridiculous reverb of ""First Words"" before, but not with this track's motorik patience, finding some odd middle ground between Kraftwerk and Mannheim Steamroller, with strange vocal manipulations added to the outro. Similarly strange conflations occur in ""Obscene Strategies"", with ""Low Rider"" percussion, wet electro-bass, violin presets and stiff-funk guitars contrast with an rude, jagged guitar riff and a spaced-out breakdown. Even the churning guitar chords and the hyperactive drumming of ""Conspiracy of the Gods"" are balanced out by deep programmed bass hits and Doppler-aping synth squiggles-- and that's before the bongos. There's no such thing as a bad idea on a Trans Am record, but on <em>Sex Change</em>, they're all delivered here in a startling deadpan.</p><p>
    If you're not into that, however, the latter half of the disc brings the throwbacks and the smirks, along with the guitars. This includes the going-nowhere-on-all-cylinders vicious chug of ""Shining Path"" and the hilarious punch-in on the beginning of ""Triangular Pyramid"", going from acoustic meandering to  a sludge-metal lullaby replete with vocoded crooning. It's an interesting middle ground the band reach here, touching upon many previous bases while not favoring entirely the guitar tomfoolery or the smirking electro-rock. If you were a fan of one extreme, <em>Sex Change</em> may not satisfy you, but if you've tuned out on their recent material-- or as Pitchfork contributor Mark Richardson put it, you ""liked them more when you were missing the point""--  this record is a welcoming shift.</p></div>"|9950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9950-sex-change/|7.0|Jason Crock

    vengeful circuits; New Zealand's Birchville Cat Motel-- Campbell Kneale-- has created two decades worth of post-Black Sabbath sludge. But, while both artists have distinctive sounds, they've often challenged themselves
    and expectations with prolificacy, range, and collaboration. This two-track
    album-- recorded on stage and in a New Zealand studio after a Swans tour
    organized by Kneale-- finds these two artists trading in their senses of dynamics for demonstrations of brute force.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The bands' goal seems to be to impress with how much sound can be made
    by three people. It was easy to expect that Yellow Swans and Birchville Cat
    Motel, when together, would launch an offensive. But this uniform, full-frontal assault is all force and no
    finesse. Opener ""Terminal Saints""'s grating
    electronic sustains smother everything that tries to take shape beneath.
    When it begins to settle 14 minutes in, it's too little, too late.<span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Problem is there seems to be little communication in the execution. Take, for instance, the stream of
    white noise that covers most of ""Terminal Carcass"", the album's second track. It's a
    colossal sound, but-- held largely constant for most of the track-- it makes
    for a miserable foundation. Everything pushing beneath and against it--
    cavity-splitting analogue screeches, a lumbering bass line, industrial metal
    flotsam-- has little to no effect. It's as though Kneale, Swanson, and Salomon's guiding principles for these improvisations was simply: get loud quickly,
    stay that way, and see what interesting stuff happens next. While that's a
    fine plan for a session between such juggernauts, it precludes success if every
    move directed toward step three-- see what interesting stuff happens next-- seems like an afterthought. Here, that happens twice, and the result is two largely uninteresting stalemates.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    This is powerful, at least: The album's gambit is to unleash a cascade of sound that pins the audience against a
    wall. That works. Kneale has been doing the same
    thing for decades in Birchville, but he's always had a way of bringing things
    back to rest, of offering a chair to the exhausted
    listener. And Yellow Swans have always mustered a
    confounding appreciation for detail, no matter the maximal wail or non-event
    creep of the sessions. For last year's Mudsuckers album with Robert Horton and
    Tom Carter, the Swans launched into a full-scale, multipart fury. They led,
    however, with a sense of their sound as a whole. This
    collaboration benefits from neither of the above. Instead, it's two behemoths, gritting
    their teeth and flexing at one another, missing an opportunity to do more.

Interestingly enough, the same moral for Lang's     futuristic city applies to the Early Years' debut album, an artistic piece with     a futuristic bent in its own right. Although press kits and cursory listens     cast a very cerebral impression of the London trio, their debut wrestles with     reconciling its stoic experimentation with surprisingly candid histrionics.     While the band's lofty list of touchstones may overwhelm, deep down this album     doesn't want to blow your mind any more than it wants to hold your hand.</p>
<p>Most of this misconception stems from first single ""All     Ones &amp; Zeros"", a pedal-to-the-metal red herring with an edge the rest     of the album lacks. This is a band proudly conceived by two guys who liked     fucking with guitar pedals enough to recruit a drummer, and ""Ones &amp;     Zeros"" showcases this sonic mêlée with enough force to land a spot in a     Nike commercial last summer. The song seamlessly shifts from uptight motorik to     space-rock explosion and back again, with frontman David Malkinson's yelps     digitally spliced and reverberated for your intergalactic pleasure.</p>
<p>Oblique nods to krautrock such as this are greatly     overshadowed by the album's stargazing, albeit direct, ballads. On ""Song     For Elizabeth"", for example, the band effectively crossbreeds the Velvet     Underground's brain-dead pop drone with the high-tech, cinematic elements of     Spiritualized. ""Brown Hearts"" follows a similar formula, though     Malkinson emotes much more strongly, hanging on to tearjerking phrases that     dramatically collide with reverb-drenched guitar riffs. Occasionally the band     strays from this, offering a smattering of Madchester one-offs (""Musik Der     Fruhen Jahre"") or an aftershock of the fist-pumping ""So Far Gone"".</p>
<p>By album's end, however, <i>Early Years</i> makes sure     to leave a wistful taste in your mouth. They pull out all stops on ""High     Times and Low Lives"", a nearly seven-minute build rallying around     Malkinson's confessional ""I'm thinking more than I ever should/ About     it."" The cosmic debris settles during the brief ""Harmonic     Interlude"" before leading into heart-on-sleeve closer ""This Ain't     Happiness"", a song that sounds like Coldplay on muscle relaxers. The sentiment's     not cheap, just disappointing considering the Can and Neu! references many will     encounter as an entry level to the band. On the U.S. release's bonus disc,     there are high-minded flashes of things to come, such as the lengthy soundscape     ""A Little More Drones"". The penchant for drama, however, too     often sets interesting ideas in a predictable groove, and it'd be nice from     time to time if the band's collective brain would tell its heart to stop its     whining.</p></div>"|9913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9913-the-early-years/|6.4|Adam Moerder

    The first record by another band on the Beastie Boys'
    Grand Royal label was a nifty EP called <em>In Search of Manny</em> by
    their East Village pals Luscious Jackson. If you're still able to enjoy funky boho <em>Mellow
    Gold­</em> Gen-Xisms, <em>In Search of Manny </em>is an overlooked gem, and
    Luscious Jackson never lived up to its promise. They sounded cool and even a
    little dark back then on dense tracks like ""Daughters of the Kaos""
    (""Insane and unknown is my only creed/ Enjoy, destroy, then set you
    free""). Word was the band's drummer used to be in the abysmal
    hardcore version of the Beastie Boys before they found hip-hop, so the ""Beastie Girls"" tag stuck with
    Luscious Jackson for a time, which was forgivable
    given the history and some other parallels. They were middle class, they knew
    their NBA references, they rapped, and, most important, they had an inside track on hip
    New York culture from the 1970s and 80s, which in those days was hard
    to come by.</p><p>
    By the time they released their full-length debut <em>Natural
    Ingredients </em>in 1994, it was clear that Luscious Jackson were on their own
    trip. The grooves found on the first five tracks of their EP-- created by Jill
    Cuniff and Gabby Glaser alone-- were built from samples and mirrored the
    blunted Bomb Squad-by-way-of-Muggs style so prevalent at the time. But <em>Natural Ingredients</em> was clean and bright pop-rock with only the barest hint of wise-ass sass,
    and it pointed the way for the rest of their career. Like so many alt-pop
    groups in the 1990s, Luscious Jackson focused on positivity, writing songs
    about respect, inner strength, and ""the state of the world"" (which,
    in retrospect, was pretty great). They weren't preachy, exactly; more the cool
    older sisters who had their shit together and were always around to remind you
    to keep your eye on the ball.</p><p>
    Two more albums followed, and Luscious Jackson's profile
    bumped a notch higher. Some time after 1999's bland <em>Electric Honey </em>they
    called it quits to pursue other projects, and now comes their first career overview. I'd like to say it collects the highlights, but that's not quite
    accurate-- those first few songs on <em>In Search of Manny </em>are their
    peak, and only one of these, ""Let Yourself Get Down,"" is represented
    here. Still, the best of the rest are present, even if some tracks sound pretty weak
    today. The clean and dinky roller-rink pop tune ""Here"" hinted at
    disco but didn't have the courage of its convictions, possibly because the old
    school downtown club sound was far from mainstream in 1994. And the limp
    affirmation ""Strongman"" can in no way be considered a highlight
    (""It takes a strongman/ To stand by a strong woman/ Yes, it does""). 
    </p>
<p>
    Even so, Luscious Jackson managed a few good singles.
    ""Naked Eye"" successfully integrated rap for the first time since the
    debut, and the chorus hook rules. ""Deep Shag"" was one of the few
    times the soul-loving Jill Cuniff was able to inhabit a song in an earthy way, and
    I wasn't surprised to find it on one of the zeitgeist-defining mixtapes
    mentioned in Rob Sheffield's book <em>Love is a Mixtape</em>. And
    ""Ladyfingers"", though it sounds a million miles from where they
    started, delivers the uplift they always promised (love to hear Pink cover it).
    A few OK remixes by the likes of Thievery Corporation and Kut Masta Kurt round
    out the set. 
    </p>
    Taken
    as a whole, this <em>Greatest Hits </em>set works more to stoke memories than as
    a musical artifact in its own right. It's very hard to imagine a 20-something
    hearing these songs for the first time and wondering where this band has been all their lives.
    Luscious Jackson, for their handful of good songs, seems to represent one of the
    90s musical dead ends, when a band with a few qualities in tune with the
    times-- a good record collection, blandly sunny politics, a willingness to
    embrace the concept of an alternative nation-- could for a moment seem edgy and
    attain some modicum of popularity. Still, though, <em>In Search of Manny</em>...</div>"|9931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9931-greatest-hits/|5.8|Mark Richardson

On such albums as <i>You Walk Alone</i> and <i>On the Way</i>, the music skirted so closely to recognizable blues-rock     forms that Corwood connoisseurs have long speculated that another unknown     guitarist joined Jandek. And though Brussels-based artist Bram Devens is far     too young and Belgian to be seriously considered as a candidate, with his     ongoing solo project Ignatz he has proven to be veritably Jandekian in his     ability to retreat into his own private, transfixing musical universe.</p>
<p>The original Ignatz, of course, appeared in George     Herriman's classic comic strip <i>Krazy Kat</i>. Krazy Kat loves Ignatz Mouse,     who enjoys throwing bricks at Krazy. Meanwhile, Offisa Pup is himself in love     with Krazy, and spends his time trying to prevent the inevitable brick-beaning.     And so it continued in Herriman's daily strip, in limitless variation, for more     than 30 years. Using only a deliberately lo-fi arsenal of guitar, FX pedals and     samplers, Devens is able to approximate something of <i>Krazy Kat's</i> captivating simplicity, repetition and symmetry. His improvised work draws     heavily on Appalachian folk and bluegrass-- as well as on the hypnotic     electric-blues of performers like Mississippi John Hurt-- but invariably     continues his travels out into the alien wilderness.</p>
<p>True to its title, <i>Ignatz II</i> is a genuine     sequel, following Devens' debut by a matter of months. (Deven's numbering     system apparently doesn't take into account last year's CD-R release <i>I Will Soothe My Eye     To Feast It With A Sight Of Beauty</i>). For this album, Devens     moves his sound in a marginally more song-oriented direction, even delivering     one acoustic track free from any disorienting effects. More typical, however,     are such songs as the opening ""He Deals With Love &amp; Her Eyes     Glaze"", which buries Ignatz's blue notes beneath a moving carpet of     spectral echoes and figures that dart like unearthly fireflies through the     darkness.</p>
<p>At its essence, folk music concerns itself with memory.     Its techniques, themes, and narratives are passed down hand-to-hand, so that     the ghosts of the past might be granted admittance to the present. On <i>Ignatz     II</i>, Devens translates this remembrance into his own uniquely scrambled     vocabulary. The delicate Ben Chasny-like picking of ""I Was Not There""     gives way to the turbulent space-blues of ""The Dreams"", whose central     riff eventually crumbles into an acrid cloud of amp distortion. The garbled     repetitions of ""Silver Moon... Shine Sun! Sun! Sun!"" call to mind the     hypnotic modal blues drones of Junior Kimbrough, while the ethereal     ""Hurling Incense"" shimmers in blank space like a single, perfectly     sustained harp note.</p>
<p>Devens sings and/or speaks on several of these tracks,     but he chooses not to duplicate the strangely high-pitched vocals that graced his     debut. On ""She Will Freeze"" and the set-closing blues shuffle     ""All Your Love"", his voice could almost be that of a standard folk     troubadour, chanting his impassioned mantras of faith and devotion from behind     the crackled veil of a prewar blues 78. But as <i>Ignatz II</i> again     demonstrates, Devens has proven regularly able to re-interpret these borrowed     texts in his own singular fashion, his handmade bricks again gloriously shaped,     baked, and thrown.</p></div>"|9918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9918-ii/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

    No doubt about it, M. Ward had a pretty good 2006. But
    if the wunder-folkie had any epiphanies following last year's breakthrough <em>Post-War</em>,
    they were probably of a practical nature. As in, Hey, I can actually make a
    living doing this! Like, a real living! One that pays the bills and everything!
    Not that <em>Post-War</em> was in any way a sell-out move (whatever that even
    means anymore). His songs have long been perfect crossover material. They've
    just been waiting for their <em>Garden State</em> to drag them out of the indie
    ghetto.</p><p>
    Who knows? It's possible that Norah Jones may yet be
    his <em>Garden State</em>. Ward sings on the sleepy chanteuse's latest album, and
    he's been tapped to open up for her on her spring tour. It's probably safe to
    assume that only a fraction of Jones' vast audience intersects with Ward's, no
    matter how much NPR love he gets, so the potential to expose his music to a
    huge new audience looms large.</p><p>
    That's partly what makes this new CD-single such a
    curious missed opportunity. With the world within his grasp, Ward's released a
    standard-issue stopgap-- and a brief, belated one at that. Merge is touting
    ""To Go Home"" as the first single from <em>Post-War</em>, even though <em>Post-War</em>
    was released last August, has already garnered rave reviews, found itself on
    numerous year-end lists, <span><span>and inspired near-capacity shows on both a full-band tour and a solo tour as well.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
    So, why wait so long to release what feels like a first
    step in the promotional chain? Well, at the very least it offers another chance
    to catch Ward's impressive take on Daniel Johnston's ""To Go Home"".
    Ward's raspy voice and keen pop instincts provide him the gift of
    interpretation, which he's put to good use in the past (it's what allowed his
    morose cover of David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"" to escape the novelty
    tag). Johnston's original lo-fi ""To Go Home"" was the perfect
    candidate for a makeover, and Ward's version was one of the highlights of <em>Post-War</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    Ward's new cover of Jimmie Dale Gilmore's ""Headed
    for a Fall"", on the other hand, is a little more complicated. It's a great
    song, too, similar in tempo and temperament to ""To Go Home"", but it's
    also first and foremost a great Jimmie Dale Gilmore song. The Texas singer's
    inimitable voice is what conveys the song's heartbreak and salvation. But it's
    one of the more standard rock tracks from Gilmore's majestic and mysterious
    1996 album <em>Braver Newer World</em>-- a disc full of worthy, more adventurous
    songs to cover-- and it leads Ward to play it safe.
    </p>
<p>
    All Ward does is lay his less distinctive voice over a
    backing track that's faithful all the way down to the droning wall of horns and the
    guitar solo outro, here courtesy Nels Cline. While there's really nothing wrong
    with the rendition, it lacks the transcendence that Gilmore brought to it. A
    line like ""I'll be waiting here when you hit bottom"" sounds oddly
    hopeful coming from Gilmore. From Ward, with Neko Case and Jim James on distant
    backing vocals, it sounds colder and a hint more menacing, missing Gilmore's
    cosmic Zen master ambivalence.
    </p>
<p>
    In between the covers are the kinds of outtakes these
    sorts of releases are designed for. First up is the rollicking
    ""Cosmopolitan Pap"", a fun nod to honky tonk that runs just under two
    minutes long. It's the kind of inconsequential ditty that hardcore types holler
    out as live requests to prove their dedication. The other new song, ""Human
    Punching Bag"", is like its dreamy roadhouse corollary, a ghostly
    reverb-drenched piano number that sounds like the type of thing the house band
    would play at the end of the night, while the bartender rinses the glasses and
    the owner sweeps the broken glass off the floor.
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe it's the context, but both songs do indeed sound
    like B-sides, and taken as a whole, the <em>To Go Home</em> single comes off less
    like a solid release than it does a commonplace sop that would have worked
    better as, say, a limited double A-side tour 7-inch. But considering the single
    arrives so long after <em>Post-War</em>, Ward fans deserved more than a pleasant
    ex post facto tease. Daniel Johnston? Jimmie Dale Gilmore? Bowie, Townshend,
    Joanna Newsom? The guy's got an ear for good material, and he's not afraid to
    share it, so why not go whole hog with a covers EP? Maybe next time.

    Somewhere in the 1930s, guitarist Les Paul began taking a 4x4 plank of wood
    with stings and a pickup to his club performances to get the volume he desired.
    When he attached the wings of another guitar to each side of ""the
    log,"" as he called it, he solved his feedback problem and the funny looks
    from the audience dissipated. In 1957, Sam Cooke made the difficult decision to
    move away from gospel and record a secular song, ""You Send Me"", under
    his own name. In 1964, Eric Burdon took the oft-covered standard ""House of
    the Rising Sun""-- cut by Bob Dylan just two years earlier-- and recorded a
    more dramatic version with his own band, the Animals, resulting in what was
    arguably the first folk-rock hit. Sometimes, there's a watershed
    ""Eureka!"" moment in an artists' career where they find their ideal
    context, as if it had been waiting for them all along. For the Black Lips, the
    live <em>Los Valientes del Mundo Nuevo</em> is it: they should always be recorded
    by John Reis (Hot Snakes, Drive Like Jehu), always be drunk, and always be in
    Tijuana.</p><p>
    ""This is gonna be the best live record of all time!"" assures
    singer Cole Alexander, like a hopeful dad taking his family on a shithole
    vacation. And then the band launches into a particularly flame-footed version
    of ""Not A Problem"" in front of a roomful of noisy and likely
    inebriated Tijuana visitors. From the very first track, ""M.I.A."", the
    songs here are sped up to their breaking point, with woozy, haphazard
    guitar-string bends that flail desperately to catch up with the rhythm
    section's pace. The jagged, vaguely Eastern riff on ""Hippy Hippy Hurrah""
    is particularly singeing, as the song flips between mumbled French and
    Alexander's wails. This and the anxious drum fills and windmill chords of
    ""Boone"" are some of the finest garage-bred surf-punk the band has to
    offer.</p><p>
    John Reis' recording of the show doesn't sacrifice an ounce of their energy
    or tone, nor does he clean up any warts, retaining the awkward banter,
    out-of-tune vocals, and frazzled connections. <em>Los Valientes</em> always
    sounds on the verge of breaking down-- not surprising to those who have seen
    the band's shambolic early shows-- but it never does. Fans will recognize eight
    of the twelve tracks from <em>Let it Bloom</em>, and the low fidelity and raucous
    nature of that record makes this rough recording sound familiar. But <em>Bloom</em>
    doesn't have a roomful of maniacs egging the band on, nor full-band sing-alongs
    on every possible note; these touches underline both the punk spirit of Black
    Lips and their unpolished performance style. Whether it's creative editing or
    just catching the band on a lucky night, it's only on the closing
    ""Juvenile"" that the band goes completely off the rails, as they ditch
    the song's manic two-chord riff for a finale of piercing, rhythmless noise.
    </p>
<p>
    I don't buy into it, but for some the romance of decadence and the
    fascination of the Behind-the-Music lifestyle makes this kind of music more
    authentic. Black Lips, or at least whoever is writing their press, sure as hell
    see things that way. They believe that you bleed and sweat and abuse yourself
    for rock and roll, and the most fucked-up band wins the prize. It's not
    important whether or not they actually live the myth offstage, just that they
    channel the spirit into their music with an intensity few bands could try for,
    much less attain. This quality is what makes <em>Los Valientes del Mundo Nuevo</em>
    that rare live album that's not just different enough from the studio records
    to justify its release, but possibly all that beginners and dilettantes need
    from the band. The Black Lips nearly destroy their songs here, but out of an
    earnest, palpable love for the material.

    With their divisive 1993 debut <em>Pablo Honey</em>, Radiohead didn't so much ride the coattails of grunge to
    mass success as stumble over them, and they've been apologizing for it
    ever since. In fact, they seem to have something of a complex about it, some deep-seated concern that they first became famous for all the wrong reasons, even if their subsequent output has more than made up for
    early missteps and misplaced earnestness.</p><p>
    Read any of Alex Ross' definitive Radiohead profiles in <em>The
    New Yorker</em>, or Nick Kent's epic interviews in <em>Mojo</em>, and you'll witness a band
    all but desperate to show off its good taste and book smarts, dropping musical
    theory and art history knowledge in the same breaths they use to praise pop
    pioneers both past and present. And look no further than Thom Yorke, so quick to
    credit predecessors such as R.E.M. and Pixies for his band's DNA, or Jonny
    Greenwood, who no sooner became a new generation's guitar hero than he started
    namedropping (and covering) 20th century composers Penderecki, Ligeti, and Messiaen, and setting aside
    his axe to experiment with proto-synthesizer the Ondes Martenot.</p><p>
    Though the group's music has established enough
    bona fides to get the band past any crisis of confidence, Radiohead's somewhat
    abashed cool-but-coy routine continues to this day. The group carefully sifts
    through the best of indiedom for appropriate opening acts. Last year Yorke
    released his solo debut <em>The Eraser</em>, which he stressed-- as if ashamed by the
    very cliché of it-- was absolutely <em>not </em>a solo debut. And most recently the singer
    big-upped the likes of Liars, Spank Rock, Modeselektor, and Stephen Malkmus on
    an iTunes ""celebrity playlist"".
    </p>
<p>
    Now comes Greenwood with his own
    mix, <em>Jonny Greenwood Is the Controller</em>, a troll through Trojan Records' vast vaults
    for some of the guitarist's favorite reggae and dub
    tracks. The compilation marks the rare opportunity for Greenwood to show off a
    part of Radiohead's creative compass, sure, but it's also yet another excuse for Trojan to repackage and rebrand its back catalog-- this time recontextualized by the endorsement of
    one of rock's most trusted tastemakers. Modest to
    the core, Greenwood didn't exactly dig up the most obscure singles and mixes he
    could find-- that might be a little too hip. In the liner notes, a humble
    Greenwood admits to a six-month reggae crash course to prepare for the project,
    which he preemptively deems just ""the surface,"" writing that he's ""still discovering
    Jamaican artists, new to me, that really should have been included here."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Oh well. But neither does
    Greenwood stick exclusively to the tried and true or obvious-- <em>that</em> would be a
    little too square. Instead, he carefully hones to the credibility-enhancing
    middle, with an emphasis on 70s tracks and a slight focus on mad scientist Lee
    ""Scratch"" Perry (represented here as either an artist, producer, or collaborator
    with four of the 17 tracks). But the 70s being the 70s, and reggae being
    reggae, how could Greenwood ignore Scratch's impact? Whether on his own with
    the out-there ""Bionic Rats"", or sprinkling his studio dust over Junior Byles'
    menacing take on ""Fever"", Perry ruled.
    </p>
<p>
    Greenwood makes sure to include
    tracks by other big behind-the-boards names, too. There's Linval Thompson's
    ""Dread Are the Controller"", which opens the disc and inspired its title, and
    Joe Gibbs, represented via Marcia Aitken's version of Alton Ellis' timeless and
    oft-covered ""I'm Still in Love"". Sly and Robbie prop up Johnny Clarke &amp; the
    Aggrovators' ""A Ruffer Version"" as well as the aforementioned ""Dread"", and
    Greenwood's quick to note there are hundreds more of their sessions where those
    came from.
    </p>
<p>
    From Jamaica's earlier wave there
    are tracks from names like Delroy Wilson, Desmond Dekker, and the Heptones, each
    still going strong as the golden age of rocksteady gave way to reggae. Being a
    Brit-rock icon, Greenwood dusts off ""Right Road to Dubland"" by the Jahlights,
    the dub version of their own ""Right Road to Zion"", which represented Britain's
    burgeoning Jamaican music scene in the late 70s-- the same scene that helped
    fuel and inspire punk and, you might say, helped lay the groundwork for
    subsequent bands like Radiohead.
    </p>
<p>
    OK, so that's a stretch. But
    other than that, there's very little here directly or indirectly related to
    Radiohead or the music it makes. So, why Greenwood, then? Why was he tapped to
    put this thing together? It's hard to imagine Greenwood lighting up and finding
    God to this stuff, and Oxford isn't known for its frats. It's a lot easier to
    imagine that he, like countless reggae fans before him, was simply attracted to
    the spacey productions and impeccable songcraft, the kind of music (as he also
    alludes to in the liner notes) that you can spend a lifetime digesting and
    enjoying. ""All musical life is here,"" he declares, and it's hard to argue, at
    least while the disc is playing.
    </p>
<p>
    But what does Greenwood bring to
    the mix that no one else could have brought? To be honest, nothing. Any number
    of Trojan comps could serve the same purpose as this one, as would
    similarly irresistible selections
    by Soul Jazz, Blood &amp; Fire, and other key Jamaican reissue labels. No, the
    exchange here is primarily one way, with the comp drawing Greenwood a little
    additional cachet nonetheless disproportionate to the relatively rote history
    he dispenses. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not that there's anything wrong
    with that. One could do much worse than spend an hour with these tracks,
    whether you've heard them once or a thousand times. The music remains vital, so there's no faulting Greenwood for sharing his newfound passion. Fellow
    newbs, though, would be wise to heed his advice: This is only the beginning,
    the surface. Keep searching and you'll keep finding.

    Since
    the mid-1990s, Toronto's Do Make Say Think have been funneling the rhythmic and
    improvisational sensibility of jazz into pastoral post-rock.
    Unlike their early work, with its abrasive tangents, their fifth album is
    fairly seamless-- it gives more and demands less from the listener, and marks
    DMST as a band more invested in confidently honing and perfecting their idiom than in pushing their own boundaries.</p><p>
    Unlike Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the group's most obvious
    analogue, DMST prefers continually shifting emphases to nail-biting crescendos. They record in barns and cabins, capitalizing upon
    these sites' natural sonic spaciousness and nostalgic atmosphere. It's doubtful that they could even make this kind of music in a professional
    studio, based as it appears to be on spontaneity and casual camaraderie; you
    can tell that being somewhere rustic and remote is crucial to their process.</p><p>
    But DMST aren't content with handing you
    a decaying artifact; they also want to impress a sense of the hands that made
    it, and <em>You, You're a History in Rust</em> is packed with evidence: Tape
    hiss, accidental guitar notes, casual laughter, and digressive
    interludes repeatedly pull us out of the music's concrete fantasy and into an
    awareness of its provisional nature.
    </p>
<p>
    It's probably a mistake to discuss <em>Rust</em> in the context of individual
    tracks, since DMST make albums first and foremost. But in certain tracks, you can hear musical decisions that do nothing to enhance the
    song at hand, yet remain essential to maintaining <em>Rust</em>'s
    delicate suspension. Take ""A With Living"": Flickering guitar trails
    and textural strums gradually evolve into a fairly straightforward
    indie rock drifter with bleary vocal harmonies that-- as is sometimes the case with DMST's like-minded contemporaries Thee
    Silver Mt. Zion-- don't detract from the
    music. A lot of bands would've stopped after the elegiac finale, but DMST
    like to expand and connect, and they extend the song for several more seemingly inconsequential minutes. Just <em>seemingly</em>, though: When
    the opening chords of ""The Universe!"" blare out, it becomes clear
    that this gauzy conclusion serves to accentuate the oncoming riptide.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite all the haunting vibes, woodwinds, and honeyed strings, rock
    music's guitar/bass/drums dynamic is dominant on <em>Rust</em>; it hovers between
    the rambunctious clatter of Broken Social Scene (which shares two members with
    DMST) and the elegant contortions of Jaga Jazzist. The individual tracks divide
    neatly between two overarching moods: pensive and emphatic. And naturally, the most
    memorable tracks fall into the latter category. ""The Universe!"" isn't
    kidding about its exclamation mark; it's a flag-waving post-rock anthem that
    lays waste for its entire five-minute run. Big-bang guitars crash and echo
    stridently over dynamited drums as a massive bassline stretches out and snaps
    back like an elastic band. ""Executioner Blues"" is nearly as stately,
    with giant reverbed chords rounding off into feedback and creeping guitars
    squalling out over plinking pianos; the guitars here emote more convincingly
    than the vocals on other tracks.
    </p>
<p>
    At their best, the album's more pensive movements don't meander. Instead,
    they lightly prod at a central theme, then cautiously retreat.
    ""A Tender History in Rust"" is one example, with its chattering
    accumulation of ambient effects, sped-up vocal loops, and flocks of tones that
    bend and slide away, but opener ""Bound to Be That Way"" really
    epitomizes this tentative approach. Skimming percussion blurs into
    hesitant pianos before fading off into the left channel and opening a space for
    gentle woodwinds and plodding guitars, creating a surface of faint ripples and
    swells. Eventually a bright acoustic figure and crisp drum rolls push through,
    and finally, a laddering guitar melody snaps in like the final piece of a
    jigsaw puzzle. It's these
    moments of sharp coherence that justify the expanses of uncertainty on <em>Rust</em>.

    In the run-up to the group's European tour with the Decemberists and the pending spring release of their Matador debut, <em>Imagine Our Love</em>, Lavender Diamond's 2005 EP has been re-released.  This four-track, 16-minute folk collection is the culmination of several years of singer Becky Stark's collaborations with guitarist Jeff Rosenberg (also of the Young People), pianist Steve Gregoropoulos (W.A.C.O.), and drummer Ron Rege, formerly of the Swirlies.   For Stark, who launched her performing career as the star of the touring punk operetta Bird Songs of the Bauharoque, Lavender Diamond provides an arena for the songwriter's post-operetta solo directions.<br/></p><p>
<em>The Cavalry of Light</em> showcases Stark's impressive range as both a composer and a vocalist.   While never straying from a 1960s foundation of guitar, piano, tambourine, and punchy drums, Stark's vocals convey a range of force-- at times an airy, cloyingly sweet modern twist of yesterfolk nostalgia (as on balladic love song ""Please"") and at others a unharnessed mystical interpretation of oft-recycled folk themes.</p><p>
    ""In Heaven There Is No Heat"" is this EP's most adventurous moment. Although its structure seems ready-made-- with a kickdrum and 2/2 guitar ditty that give rise to a loud, bright, friendly chorus-- Stark's vocals provide a surprising, coolly lit counterpoint. Her high soprano works playful yet achy magic around her winding lyrical path: ""In heaven there is no heat/ In sorrow there is no rhyme.""   The chorus provides the rumbling, focused security: ""Dream the kind of a life that you will find/ The kind of love that lasts forever.""   There are no transitions or bridges between these two moods, and by way of this contrast, the song succeeds and sticks.</p><p>
    Even better is the epic ""You Broke My Heart"", a solid march within the EP's close-to-the-hearth recording environment.   Here, Stark's vocals resound with the strength of a singer quite apart-- though not stylistically-- from the one who appears elsewhere on the EP.  Operatic and mesmerizing, Stark retains her seamless and clear soprano.   But the heavy instrumental accompaniment and song's subject provide fuel for boundless one-upmanship.   As a standalone track, ""You Broke My Heart"" announces Stark's virtuosity, but the three tracks following it are a positive reinforcement of the singer's welcome, novel addition to a crowded scene.

    As home recording technology advances, the illusion of
    music as unmediated communication is becoming more and more seductive. Whereas
    homemade recordings used to bear the aesthetic limitations of
    ""lo-fi,"" artists can now deliver multitracked digital epics that
    seemingly spring fully formed from their brains into your iTunes-- no band,
    studio, engineer, or producer necessary. This freedom can yield amazing
    results, but it doesn't come without its pitfalls: In many cases, the absence
    of constraints and collaborators can result in a disorganized and unwieldy
    record. <em>White Flight</em>, the debut release from former Anniversary
    guitarist Justin Roelofs, illustrates this point.</p><p>
    Recorded in a neighbor's basement, <em>White Flight</em>
    is an overstuffed assortment of hip-hop beats, hippie poetry, and indie pop
    instrumentation. It's a record that could be described as
    ""unclassifiable"" or ""genre-bending,"" but leaves you
    wondering why these descriptions are generally deployed as compliments. The
    most ""classifiable"" and ""genre-stable"" moments of <em>White
    Flight</em> are generally the most rewarding, if only because the record so
    rarely comes into focus at all.</p><p>
    With its warm drum machine beats and jubilant horns,
    album opener ""Now"" immediately brings to mind the excellent bedroom
    pop of Matthew Adam Hart's Russian Futurists. However, Roelofs does nothing to
    cultivate or develop the sense of musical intimacy hinted at on
    ""Now"". Hart always wraps his compositions around a central memorable
    melody, but there is little overarching musical logic to <em>White Flight</em>.
    By the middle of the overlong ""Pastora Divine"", Roelofs'
    Devendra-esque warble, which never really seems to commit to a melodic or
    rhythmic style, has already worn out its welcome. 
    </p>
<p>
    And it's a shame, too, because Roelofs does find his
    way to some genuinely interesting moments. While nothing approaches the overall
    success of ""Now"", there are a handful of impressive sonic and melodic
    fragments scattered throughout the album. For the most part, these are isolated
    instances of sharp production-- particular drum or keyboard parts that seem
    almost uncannily well suited to the way they're recorded. This convergence of
    material and treatment helps many of the record's weaker sections slide by
    unnoticed, and lends an air of cohesiveness to a woefully disjointed record. 
    </p>
<p>
    In a sense, the blog buzz <em>White Flight</em> has been
    receiving is perfectly apt-- the album is loaded with the kind of ""Whoa,
    that sounds cool!"" moments that can grab your attention even while you're
    absorbed in online multitasking. But this record is not flattered by scrutiny.
    Stripped of its bells and whistles, there isn't much substance to <em>White
    Flight</em>, and even its abundant sonic embellishments can come off as mere
    annoyances when given too much attention.

It was a telling moment, a weird backhanded compliment: For some reason, folks still don't expect a woman to shred. Well, dudes, Marnie Stern does-- <em>and how</em>.</p><p>
    She does just about everything here, handling guitars, vocals, synths, songwriting, and production. But no one's an island: Hella's Zach Hill plays drums, an addition that brings more muster to Stern's debut. Hill also chips in a pair of keys, bass, and production. Extra bass and even more organ/key duties go to John-Reed Thompson, who engineered and mixed much of <em>In Advance</em>. But despite the extra hands, it's Stern's fingerprints that matter.</p><p>
    Beyond pure technical skill-- almost more impressively, really-- Stern sounds like nobody else. She told <em>The New Yorker</em> that she ostensibly didn't listen to ""good music"" (as she calls it) until she was 23. At that time, Sleater-Kinney were her watershed; she eventually found Hella, Boredoms, Melt-Banana. Don Caballero reportedly inspired her finger-tap technique (as well, perhaps, as her lengthy song titles). You'll hear bits of those bands across the 13 tracks-- that S-K guitar interplay and lilt revved with caffeine and turned into a 60-string molotov. The biggest unspoken presence for my buck, though, is Mick Barr, who wields a similar I-am-a-rock feel in Orthrelm, Ocrilim, Octis, other ""O""'s, and his <em>Shred Earthship</em> collaboration with Hill. Beyond the ubiquitous Hella drummer, Barr and Stern also share a propulsive buoyancy, affixing emotion to flat-out, jaw-dropping chops.
    </p><p>
    Unlike Barr, Stern's seeking pop concision. I caught him rattling out a long solo guitar piece at the Whitney at Altria a month or two ago-- if it'd been Stern, she would've subdivided the real-time loop 10 times and added a vocal chirp. That's another thing: Her voice is a major component to her practice, layered as many times as her guitar. She can sound a bit like Deerhoof's Satomi-- the way she rides atop the guitars, a stone skipping across water. But the chants are more next-room distant, gauzy. Structurally, she sets up her own call-and-response (musically and lyrically), her sing-talk style cutting across the strings like a rogue auctioneer or cheerleader.
    </p>
<p>
    But talk about front-loading: <em>In Advance</em> roars out of the gate with ""Vibrational Match"", ""Grapefruit"", and ""Every Single Line Means Something"", each showing Stern at her best. At those moments, her playing and dynamics are complimented wonderfully by Hill's horse-racing drums, as she strums over her own amplification and tripped ""adjust your perceptions"" lyrics (in one spot, someone crawls to a gutter with broken knees). In that sense, if ""Every Single Line Means Something"" is taken as a commentary on every vocal bit and modulating Van Halen guitar line, Stern's work becomes a true-blue head fuck. 
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, <em>In Advance</em> isn't an EP, and things falter a bit past the halfway mark. Let's use another song title as an instruction: ""Put All Your Eggs in One Basket and Then Watch That Basket!!!"" Yeah, perhaps the palette <em>could</em> be a tad more various; the addition of some breaks or other dynamics would help. As is, by the end of the record, the insouciance has faded a bit, the shredding lost some of its stream. For example, take a look at ""This American Life""-- ingredients that sounded brilliant elsewhere, dodder a bit and yearn for variation. Oddly, as the song titles get more intriguing-- ""Letters From Rimbaud"", ""Plato's Fucked-Up Cave""-- the songs themselves are less interesting.
    </p>
<p>
    An album needs pacing. For instance,<em> Grindstone,</em> the recent Shining outing scatters weirdness into various baskets, creating a super slow, imploded central shift and ultimately, well, a diamond. Here Stern keeps stabbing, and so the steam lessens. Strange then that Barr can do something like <em>OV</em>, looping endlessly, without it getting a snore. So, maybe she needs to extend some of the riffs? Perhaps there's <em>too much</em> going on-- the glass is empty, the glass is half full...<br/>
</p>
<p>
    There's a stand-out section where Stern nails this sorta next-big-thing. Check the link/transition between ""Logical Volume"", a feedbacking chant that stands in place a bit before moving into an almost elegiac realm, and the up-tempo  ""Absorb Those Numbers"". Hear how it soars?  It's a delicate balance, and she pulls it off remarkably well. On the latter she intones, ""As your breath catches up from where you began"": The present catching up to its past and circling back to a shared beginning.  Here, too, she showcases different textures of her voice, turning the guitar into an almost jazz sax behind her catchy, modulated hooks. At these moments, regardless of the late-period bomb, you know for fucking sure Stern has it-- a charisma and technique that already distinguishes her as pure Technicolor in a glutted, black-and-white scene.

    Recorded at a 2006 show in London, <em>The Confessions Tour</em> is Madonna's
    second concert CD+DVD set in eight months. The first, <em>I'm Going to Tell You
    a Secret,</em> supported her <em>American Life</em> album and had the distinction
    of being both the first live album of her quarter-century career and her greatest
    musical fiasco. While similar in staging, this new set supports a much better
    album, 2005's stronger <em>Confessions on a Dance Floor</em>, and that alone makes it
    the better of the two. Viewed together-- their quick succession makes it
    impossible to assess them separately-- this pair of releases signals the
    beginning of a new stage in Madonna's career, one in which director Jonas
    Åkerlund has become more crucial than musical producer Stuart Price, and music
    has become secondary to the dizzying, dazzling, slightly nauseating spectacle
    of her live show.</p><p>
    That spectacle has eclipsed music in the Madonnaverse is readily apparent on
    the <em>Confessions</em> tracklists. The DVD contains a full concert, with 21
    tracks running more than two long hours. The CD has a mere 13, including two
    versions of ""Sorry"" and several of Stuart Price's instrumental
    interludes, which demand visuals to explain what the hell is going on. Instead
    of ""Live to Tell"", the CD contains songs like
    ""Confessions"", during which Madge's dancers describe life-changing
    experiences. One tells of an abusive father, another of her belief in angels,
    the third of his ""decision to gangbang."" Without the performers'
    hyperactive and not unimpressive moves, the song sounds aimless and exploitive,
    group therapy set to music.</p><p>
    Instead of presenting herself as the art-school activist of <em>Secret</em>
    (which was recorded during an election year, after all), on <em>Confessions</em>
    Madonna plays the part of a self-help guru-- Tony Robbins with a Farrah 'do and
    an ugly leotard. The recurring theme is self-empowerment, which she means to be
    universal, but which ultimately is specific to Madonna. On the lively
    ""Jump"" she extols the virtues of self-motivation and sisterhood. She
    confidently masters the simplest guitar riffs on ""I Love New York""
    and ""Drowned World"" and doesn't care what you think of her clumsy
    dances moves. 
    </p>
<p>
    Granted, empowerment is easy when you've got thousands of fans applauding
    your at every turn. And why shouldn't they? Madonna has the power to put on a
    ludicrous, obscenely expensive stage show-cum-counseling session year after
    year, as well as the brand name to make <em>Confessions</em> one of the
    top-grossing tours of 2006. She has the body of her much younger self, so she
    can still rock a leotard or a feathered collar, no matter how ill-advised such
    wardrobe choices may be. And her voice has aged surprisingly well. She can't
    sell the girlish giggle of ""Lucky Star"" or ""Like a Virgin"", but she's got a deeper, heartier range that works best on
    ballads like ""Drowned World/Substitute for Love"" and ""Paradise
    (Not for Me)"". We are left, however, to imagine how commanding Madonna
    would sound on a <em>good</em> ballad, like ""Oh Father"" or
    ""Something to Remember"". ""Live to Tell"" might have fit the
    bill here, but she delivers it perched uncomfortably on a mirror-covered cross,
    which limits her breathing and phrasing as well as our ability to take her
    seriously. 
    </p>
<p>
    Let's talk about that disco crucifixion. Nothing says ""I've got a
    messiah complex"" like performing on a cross, and this notorious routine,
    which begins as a comment on the travails of fame, sure enough turns into a
    plea to end AIDS in Africa. That's a serious issue, and it deserves better than
    this confused, self-aggrandizing pitch. Nevertheless, this segment will likely
    be a selling point for many fans and bystanders alike: It was cut from the
    original NBC broadcast of the show following the expected avalanche of Catholic
    uproar and outraged punditry. 
    </p>
<p>
    But it's a polite curtsy compared to what happens when Madonna's politics go
    global. During ""Forbidden Love"" two male dancers appear with symbols
    of Islam and Judaism painted on their abdomens, locking arms stoically in a
    choreography that makes them look like two children fighting in the backseat.
    But that's just silly, not insulting. The show's nadir comes during
    ""Isaac"". Centerstage stands a giant cage in which a burqa-clad dancer
    twirls and gyrates. When the gate lifts, her cage dance becomes a striptease.
    From one oppression to another... 
    </p>
<p>
    As always, Madonna is at her best when the stakes are low and the music
    frivolous, an approach that seems natural for the frothy disco of <em>Confessions
    on a Dance Floor</em>. The live show's best-- and consequently most meaningful--
    moments come during the closing disco-kitsch set, which begins with a mash-up
    of her underrated single ""Music"" and the Trammps' ""Disco
    Inferno"" and closes with a medley of ""Lucky Star"" and ""Hung
    Up"". Despite the tacky travel-agency brochure vibe of ""La Isla Bonita"",
    these songs achieve the sort of gaudy pop transcendence that justifies the
    month's-pay ticket price.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, it's too little too late to salvage <em>Confessions</em>, which, with <em>Secret</em>,
    feels like a failure of imagination. Åkerlund gives you everything you don't
    want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give you no sense of
    space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals that give you no sense of
    performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement.
    But Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of
    amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of
    traveling circus. So why not try to break down the wall between performance and
    audience and hold a gigantic rave? Or, better yet, launch a small-club tour and
    share the spotlight with some musical collaborators. Work with Timbaland or
    even Xiu Xiu. Let other people write songs for you. Reinvent yourself for real
    this time. Until Madonna comes up with something completely new and makes her
    shows as exciting to watch as they are to perform, her spectacle will never be
    as fun or as world-changing as her music.

    Among producers working with sampled wax, no one has gotten more mileage out of less surface area than Brinkmann-- he's explored every nook and cranny of the vinyl record's grooved surface. His earliest productions were more like conceptualist interventions, as he played back records by Mike Ink and Richie Hawtin on a custom-made, two-tonearmed turntable that transformed their desiccated thumps into woozy, chopped-and-screwed dub techno. The process shared as much in common with Milan Knizak or Christian Marclay's Fluxus pranks as it did contemporary remixology. Subsequent releases found Brinkmann further reducing his subject matter, literally carving his beats by scratching vinyl with an X-acto knife and using the resulting clicks and pops in place of kicks and hi-hats.</p><p>
    Brinkmann's more recent output-- the single ""Lovesong""/""Hatesong"", the album <em>Lucky Hands</em>-- has employed a fuller range of sources, relying on fat, gloopy samples and synthesizer sounds to turn out a carnivalesque take on techno, but <em>Klick Revolution</em>, following up on 2000's <em>Klick</em>, finds Brinkmann stripping down as minimally as ever. There are a few ""musical"" elements here-- hazy washes of strings run backwards, lone piano notes as delicate as Morton Feldman's-- but for the most part, Brinkmann's structures are thickets of skittering white noise. </p><p>
    These are the kind of aleatory rhythms that could arise only from the collision of stylus, dust mote, and battered vinyl, and they're immediately recognizable as such. As a gimmick, it's a concept that's long worn out its welcome; what makes it work here, perhaps better than ever before in Brinkmann's career, is the hypnotic precision with which the frizzy loops hang together. Brinkmann's sense of rhythm is as nuanced as Ricardo Villalobos', and it's not hard to find a profound sense of funk in Brinkmann's skipping, popping polyrhythms, as a rollicking techno chug gives way to an almost schaffel-like three-against-two pattern. Mixing and filtering much as a DJ would, Brinkmann builds up layer upon layer of loops; moving through them feels like riding a train through a landscape of shifting moiré patterns.</p><p>
    Ultimately, <em>Klick Revolution</em> is all about the concept of collision. What happens when funk, aka ""black music,"" collides with the brushed percussion and dissonant arrangements of the European avant-garde? (It might not be a coincidence that the cover art for <em>Klick Revolution</em>, like that of its predecessor, is black and white—although this time out, everything seems to be fading to gray.) What happens when playback devices become performers, and when machines play music with the kind of timing once only expected from human expression? According to its press release, <em>Klick Revolution</em> is allegedly ""a tribute to the pinball machine… the locked box with the inclined plane,"" which has led some reviewers to hear in the album the clack and whir of bumpers and flippers. (According to Brinkmann, they're missing the point: No arcade games were harmed in the making of this recording.) I'm inclined to see the pinball concept as a red herring, just another feint from this  infamously tricksterish artist-- a ball of fluff designed to knock the needle off course, as it were. But whatever your take on its theoretical underpinnings, this short, gripping record is a masterpiece of minimalist intensity and meticulous execution. <br/></p></div>"|9904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9904-klick-revolution/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

    Marco Benevento plays keyboards. Joe Russo plays drums. The two shared an
    eighth-grade teacher a decade before sharing a weekly residency at the Knitting
    Factory in New York. Things clicked for them during that 2002 stint, and they
    named the accidental project Benevento/Russo Duo. They quickly became favorites
    on the jam band circuit and recorded two albums. The second, <em>Play Pause Stop</em>,
    sounds like an instrumental Arcade Fire-- more organ, less guitar, similar
    arena-sized airs and aims. They hired an indie rock publicist and then joined a
    post-Phish quartet with Mike Gordon and Trey Anastasio. They tried to swing
    both sets at Bonnaroo. Benevento and Russo are spectacular musicians; they must
    be professional masochists, too.</p><p>
    Indie rock bands are playing jam festivals because the pay is good. But
    indie kids don't typically go to jammy shows, and indie rock is defined less by
    qualities and sounds than qualifiers and scenes. We're at a point when
    everything-- from robed cults in choirs and polyrhythmic harpists in animal
    skins to cantankerous bands bleating about child stars and splintery trios
    playing math rock-- is deemed ""indie rock."" And, even if they're
    avoiding the mantle while gigging with Anastasio, the Benevento/Russo Duo is
    bold indie rock for right now.</p><p>
<em>Play Pause Stop</em> goes straight for the gut: The titular opener is a
    cathedral-sized, eight-minute anthem, Russo's drums laying down colossal booms
    above and beneath Benevento's fuzz-toned Hammond runs. Two minutes in, they
    launch a lyric-less chorus for six voices-- ""Whoa-oh-oh-oh."" It turns
    to repeat, casting plotlines for the release and resolve the Duo builds with
    almost every track. The pair erects a spire-shaped theme only to bury it in a
    noisy midsection, a tone akin to that of Christian Fennesz' signal manipulation
    morphing melody into dynamic static. Three minutes later, they resurrect it and
    let it burn. It's bolder, heavier and prouder now, but still serving its tune
    well. Similarly, ""Something for Rockets"" rides a stepladder organ
    riff to the top like energy escaping an atmosphere. The ascension comes with
    the slow dazzle of infinity instead of climax. From up here, you can see the
    universal vistas of M83 and the heights of Bowie's <em>Hunky Dory</em>. It feels
    great.
    </p>
<p>
    Indeed, Benevento and Russo sound like they're having the time of their
    lives, and it's hard to blame them: For their debut, <em>Best Reason to Buy the
    Sun</em>, they zealously sacrificed the songs to manifest chops and
    imaginations. On <em>Play Pause Stop</em>, they play the songs big and let them
    shout for themselves. The dexterity and innovation manifest naturally. A
    progression this complete and successful-- no matter if it's linear-- should
    call for a victory screed, and this is it. It's easy, for instance, to picture
    them beaming during the final minute of ""Soba"", having weathered a
    half-dozen tempered and ponderous movements during the first four minutes. Time
    running out, they explode: Russo dances across the song with a frantic beat,
    and Benevento's two hands cut through it with acid-washed organ.
    </p>
<p>
    But neither the loaded emotion of the songs on <em>Play Pause Stop</em> nor
    the band's melodic devotion should suggest they're neglecting their
    theory-heavy past or adulterating their skills. To the contrary, there are no
    guests here, so the Duo is forced to play on another level. The two-man ideal
    pushes Benevento and Russo to seek new instruments and textures, incorporating
    guitar, Mellotron, Wurlitzer, and bass where there was none before. They focus
    their writing and playing around that expanded palette. The musical frills that
    are here-- that pause run on the title track, the humid guitar-and-bells motif
    of the closing ""Memphis"", the reverse guitars of ""Powder""
    that eventually fall to a fiery organ restatement-- augment moods without
    diluting potency. It makes for a strong, agile, and ultimately believable
    record. Several more credible indie rockers could stand a little more of all
    three right now.

    Lucky Pierre
    is the solo identity of Aidan Moffat, who until last year was the vocal half of
    Arab Strap. Malcolm Middleton handled most of the music in that outfit, but
    Moffat had plenty of the stuff in his own head, and since 2002 has kept a
    release schedule on the side even more prolific than his primary band's. This
    is his third Pierre
    record, though it's the first since he shortened the ""Lucky"" bit to just plain
    ""L.""</p><p>
    The name originally comes from the title of an early 1960s
    sexploitation flick called <em>the Adventures
    of Lucky Pierre</em>,
    which is something you might expect if you've listened to much Arab Strap. But
    while Moffat spent his time in that band deadpanning his way through the pain
    of romantic loss until the beer ran out, there's none of that here. Moffat's
    instrumental side is sounding pretty darn grand these days, even angelic in
    places. Whether it's a good look for him is debatable, though you have to
    admire his willingness to step out right after his very
    well-liked band just broke up and throw a curveball like this-- let's just say
    it's unlikely Pierre
    could get lucky with this as a soundtrack. He might get murdered though.</p><p>
    The album's biggest problem is that it's terribly
    unbalanced, opening with three droning, very similar tracks, one of which lasts 12 minutes with only the introduction of a plinky drum machine halfway
    through for variation. Human voice sounds, seemingly sampled into a
    synthesizer, lie very, very still while trumpets meander on top of them,
    creating the sort of sound that might play when the pearly gates appear in a
    movie, except that it lasts a really long time and never goes anywhere. It's a
    long way from the thump and dread of the first Lucky Pierre album.
    </p>
<p>
    It's the second half of the record where things get more
    interesting. ""Ache"" and ""Hike"" are both composed mostly for strings, but
    they're wildly different from each other and everything that surrounds
    them. You could guess what ""Ache"" sounds like from the title. It's a mournful
    two-chord piano skeleton wrapped in self-doubting string section flesh, very
    much like a lost Dakota Suite track. For the first two minutes the rhythm of
    the piano chords keeps slowing down, and as the piece loses forward energy, the
    strings come apart, regrouping as the rhythm stabilizes in the middle. ""Hike"",
    on the other hand feeds off of forward momentum the whole way, with a string
    section that builds off a quick baroque cello figure and gallops along with a
    drum machine that sounds like bacon sizzling and banjo that should sound out of
    place but doesn't. If you've ever wanted to hear a banjo play something that
    sounds like Bach (and I mean that as an unqualified compliment to the music),
    here's your chance. 
    </p>
<p>
    And then it's back to the drones, which are all very pretty
    but ultimately not too exciting. They frequently sound like backgrounds begging
    for a foreground. I love the way the piano part rolls in and out like a wave on
    the shore on ""Drift"", but I'd like the tide to grow more or less turbulent
    along the way-- to vary in some respect. The synths that waft on top don't lead
    anywhere. There are building blocks for something fantastic in most of these
    pieces, but only in two of them have they been used to make more than the sum of their parts.

    somewhere between painful and annoying on the irritation scale. They're one of
    life's great certainties, unavoidable no matter how much care you take in
    sorting sheaves or stuffing envelopes. It takes a few seconds after that first,
    fateful slice before the sting sets in, a throbbing, sometimes bloody reminder
    of the fragility of our fleshy frames.</p><p>
    Papercuts (the band) fall somewhere between pleasant and
    beautiful on the listening scale. They're self-consciously mysterious, no
    matter how much effort you put into making sense of the decidedly low-key yet
    somehow stirring songs. It takes a few seconds of Papercuts' second album, <em>Can't Go Back</em>, to think that maybe you've stumbled upon something special, a
    delicate mood piece made to slice through the din and chaos of modern life.</p><p>
    Or maybe it's just another gently
    indulgent bedroom production featuring a guy cribbing from a great record
    collection, cooing sweet nothings and coming off like some late 1960s
    summer-into-fall semi-obscurity sprinkled with a healthy dose of indie-dust.
    But like Papercuts' namesake, there's a nagging sensation there's more going on
    than first appears, and that the band's modesty can't disguise a gift for
    melody equal to its knack for channeling a host of half-familiar influences.
    </p><p>
    Perhaps that should be ""his"" knack
    for channeling, as Papercuts is essentially Bay Area songwriter Jason Quever,
    whose last name almost perfectly describes his high, thin singing voice. That
    voice is frequently double-tracked and cloaked with touches of ghostly reverb,
    the last refuge of the painfully insecure and a surefire way to hide yourself
    while imparting an otherworldly vibe. But the shy act-- ""I'm always on the
    outside looking in,"" Quever sings on ""Outside Looking In""-- may be just that,
    as no wallflower could accumulate the fans this guy has. Devendra Banhart and
    Vetiver's Andy Cabic are releasing the disc via their Gnomonsong imprint, and
    Grizzly Bear tapped Papercuts for their current tour. Quever's also
    collaborated, crossed paths, or intersected with Casiotone for the Painfully
    Alone and Cass McCombs.
    </p>
<p>
    He's also breathed deep from the
    stylish post-Summer of Love haze, when dope-smoking folkies traded tokes for
    euphoric doses, and when the VU started sharing (select) shelf space with Dylan
    albums and dreamy L.A. singer-songwriter projects. Not that you'd necessarily
    glean that from the first song, ""Dear Employee"", an anomalous chamber-pop kiss
    off that's got more in common with the Hidden Cameras (minus the ""gay church""
    thing).
    </p>
<p>
    Halfway through second song,
    ""John Brown"", however, after a dramatic pause gives way to a double-time
    detour, the disc's trippy heritage kicks in. ""Summer Long"" channels prime
    girl-group pop for the coffee-house set, sounding like Dylan's <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em> players subbing for a Phil Spector session, while humming organ and
    airy harmonies underscore the deceptively bright ""Unavailable"". 
    </p>
<p>
    With the shaggy, shambling ""Take
    the 227th Exit"", the fashionable psych and <em>Basement Tapes</em> touches
    really begin to meld and manifest themselves, and over the disc's latter half
    the shape and spirit of the songs such as the droning ""Sandy"" and the
    sepia-toned sunset of a eulogy ""Just Another Thing to Dust"" grow more and more
    diffuse, even if the winsome tunes keep them from floating off into the
    ether. The songs seem to proceed
    on a narcotic lag, with the subtle, shimmering backing instrumentation shifting
    ever so slightly in unexpected ways. 
    </p>
<p>
    By ""Found Bird"", Quever's on
    another plane, his voice processed to an abstract warble that sounds like he's
    singing from the heavens, looking down, amused at the world he's left behind.
    The disc's extended denouement, with its protracted and seemingly improvised
    piano solo, achieves a certain transcendence before giving way to the statelier
    ""The World I Love"", a sign that Quever's still with us and not off counting
    butterflies or something. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not that he sounds like he would
    embrace subjects so hippie-banal. Quever might run with the hairy-and-happy
    crowd, but ""Can't Go Back"" avoids
    unicorns and fanciful imagery for something simpler and more affecting. West
    Coast to the core, it's music for the journey, not for the arrival, the soundtrack
    to getting somewhere else rather than music to get lost to. Or maybe both.

    As an ambient artist, Eluvium's Matthew Cooper is working in a pretty crowded
    field, but with a gradually evolving sound and distinctive approach to his genre, his profile continues to rise. Though his 2003 all-piano record <em>An Accidental Memory in Case of Death </em>might
    have seemed like a left turn in light of the guitar-based drone tracks
    that came before and after, his records all share an aesthetic: Eluvium's ambient
    music is music first and ambient second; it leans forward, asks for
    consideration, and has no desire to slip into the background. That
    thread continues on his newest full-length, even as his palette broadens
    considerably.</p><p>
    Incorporating strings, horns, woodwinds, and more
    piano, <em>Copia </em>is the grandest, most sweeping Eluvium record to date. The
    word that keeps coming to mind is ""regal,"" perhaps because the lush
    opening fanfare ""Amreik"" sets the tone for the album so perfectly.
    Just over three minutes long, the rich blend of French horns, trumpets and
    trombones comes together to form a soundtrack for convocation. From
    there, the record dives headlong into the 10-minute ""Indoor
    Swimming at the Space Station"", which layers piano and strings (never
    quite clear throughout what is sampled, what is live, and what is synthetic) on
    his most filmic piece to date.</p><p>
    As ""cinematic"" music goes-- and the adjective
    is appropriate throughout <em>Copia</em>-- these pieces tend toward widescreen
    pictures with big budgets. It's grand movie music in the ""Adagio With
    Strings"" sense; we're not talking about exercises in subtle shading. With
    that in mind, Cooper has developed a good sense of pacing and structure, and
    some of these pieces are terrifically affecting. ""Seeing You Off the
    Edges"" is mostly a cluster of held cello notes, but those moments when the
    melody jumps an octave trigger an immediate pang of longing. ""After
    Nature"", a chamber piece that layers violins with heavy reverb,
    sounds like something that would waft out of the ballroom in <em>The Shining </em>during
    one of Jack Nicholson's breaks away from the typewriter. ""Ostinato""
    is a gradually unwinding piece for pipe organ with a simple melody, but during
    the pattern's lowest ebb, when the bass pedal comes in and vibrates the room,
    it echoes a towering cathedral. 
    </p>
<p>
    My issue with <em>Copia-- </em>the thing that keeps this
    record from greatness-- is Cooper's approach to piano. I know people who love <em>Accidental Memory </em>and the dabbling
    of acoustic keys on last year's <em>When I Live By the Garden and the Sea </em>EP,
    but this is where I always find myself tuning out. <em>Copia </em>is the first
    record where piano is fully integrated into other aspects of Cooper's sound;
    for my money, these tracks are the record's weakest, coming across as
    unpleasantly leading, sometimes bordering on manipulative. Any sense of
    mystery-- a quality essential to Eluvium's best music-- evaporates completely
    during ""Prelude for Time Feelers"" and ""Radio Ballet"", where
    piano dominates. The word ""Satie"" sometimes comes up when he goes in
    this direction, which is way off; ""Winston"" is more accurate. Coming
    from a guy who owned a few Windham Hill albums back in the day, I don't mean
    this as a dig; the piano-led tracks are enjoyable and pretty but almost
    defiantly surface-level. 
    </p>
    The
    nine-minute finale ""Repose in Blue"", on the other hand, shows Cooper
    at his large-canvas best, where the on-the-nose emotional pointers work to his
    advantage. He discards the line between drama and melodrama as he bursts in
    halfway though a piece of brooding cello drone laced with horns and throws a
    recording of fireworks against the black sky. The explosions sound like bass
    and kettledrums as they burst at random without a discernible pattern, and it
    nicely completes the John Phillip Sousa Americana hinted at on the record's
    opener. If ""Amreik"" was a formal procession in June, this is
    Independence Day a month later, with bombs bursting in air as the orchestra
    beneath weaves a lament for the radio simulcast. It is, of course, over the
    top, but to a degree that strikes me as courageous. Eluvium's music isn't a web
    of possibilities to be explored, but a very specific path to be followed. When
    it works as well as it does on ""Repose in Blue"", it takes you to an exalted
    place.</div>"|9926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9926-copia/|7.7|Mark Richardson

    At a time when heart-on-sleeve indie rock is enjoying a lengthy peak,
    Richard Swift fits in with the legion of angst-ridden arty man-boys while
    simultaneously setting himself apart. Swift's music is full of internal
    frustrations-- from interpersonal insufficiencies to existential doubt-- but he
    cushions the blow with a deep-seated theatrical impulse rooted in the notion of
    the sad clown. Swift is a self-loathing schlub to be sure, but instead of
    reaching into the dark depths of his unconscious for inspiration, he channels
    <em>Pagliacci</em> and puts on a show.</p><p>
<em>Dressed Up for the Letdown</em> retains much of the turn-of-the-century
    music hall affectations of its predecessor <em>The Novelist</em>, which garnered
    comparisons to Rufus Wainwright and Ray Davies with its thoroughgoing pre-pop
    pretense. In 2005, Swift bundled that record with <em>Walking Without Effort</em>,
    which introduced his California singer-songwriter side while keeping his
    romantic disposition intact. On <em>Letdown</em>, both sides combine to form a
    unique pop anachronism. Swift's merry melodies and uninhibited sensitivity draw
    equally on the immaculate piano pop of Carole King's <em>Tapestry</em> and the
    strummy self-awareness of Jackson Browne's early Asylum Records releases, but
    it's his noticeable theatricality that sets him apart.</p><p>
    By design, <em>Letdown</em> opens anticlimactically, as Swift reluctantly
    takes the stage and expresses his reservations about his role as entertainer.
    His voice is draped in echo, which adds an appropriately dreamlike tinge to the
    song that extends to the rest of the record. After a buoyant trumpet coda that
    leads him back to the shadows, the album proceeds forth as an extended dream
    sequence, where Swift finds himself in a catch-22 of his own design: he's
    certain of his inadequacies as a performer, but knows no other way to relieve
    his emotional burden than through song. The type of music he creates is far
    from what sells records: or as Swift phrases it, they're ""the right songs
    for the wrong crowd."" The opener gives way to the hopeful, lighthearted
    piano romp ""The Songs of National Freedom"", in which Swift continues,
    ""I made my way into the spotlight, just to realize it's not what I
    want."" He realizes by the end of the song, however, that his emotional
    void is better filled with a real-life counterpart than with public
    recognition.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Artist &amp; Repertoire"" falls in the middle of the record, and
    is the clearest expression of Swift's charming, slightly outmoded disdain for
    the recording industry. In a hushed, plaintive voice, Swift plays the role of
    the A&amp;R man with surprising sympathy: ""Sorry Mr. Swift, but there's no
    radio that likes to play the songs of your lovers' sorrow,"" and then,
    ""Sorry Mr. Swift, but you're much too fat, and could I persuade you just
    to wear a cap?"" It's the only direct jab at the business end of music,
    refreshing for a record so thoroughly concerned with its creator's public
    persona. 
    </p>
<p>
    Swift's most appealing traits remain his hopeless romanticism and canny
    knack for catchy tunes, and <em>Letdown</em> surrounds these tendencies with
    appropriately lush production. ""Most of What I Know"" is an unassuming
    mid-tempo gallop, but with rich, layered acoustic guitars supporting Swift's
    closest approximation to a soaring vocal delivery, and a chorus that pushes the
    underappreciated floor tom into the spotlight as a throbbing heartbeat.
    ""Buildings in America"" opens coyly enough as a delicate folk song
    but dramatically changes for its final third. Swift's generous tenor expands to
    match the growling bass and swirling atmospherics that suddenly appear, as if
    the curtain behind his small stage suddenly fell and revealed an elaborate
    backdrop with a dozen more musicians.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Letdown</em> closes quietly, though, with ""The Opening Band"", a
    slight gospel-folk number, within which Swift's multitracked voices hover in
    the mix like apparitions. He takes solace in an undisguised allegory of John
    the Baptist, who served as the opening act for his ""cousin Christ.""
    With a modest economy of language, Swift recounts of the headliner how
    ""they tried to kick his ass,"" yet he ""didn't fight back.""
    The song ends with profound uncertainty, only the disquieting notion that
    ""we all die when it's our time."" 
    </p>
<p>
    As a closing act for an album full of dramatic despair and longing, it's
    fitting, if not also a bit troubling. Earlier on the record, lyrics like
    ""everyone loves you when you're gone"" and ""I wish I was dead
    most of the time/ But I don't really mean it"" were couched in irony, but
    the last minute or so of ""Band"" is more serious. It slowly eases a
    despair that now seems deeper, gradually softening and losing volume until
    gently fading into silence.

    If you don't know who Dredd Foole is, think Miles Davis. But know that Foole is a white man from Vermont, born 24 years after Davis and having come of age in psychedelic high school garage bands and in the late 1970s and early 80s art-punk scene of New England. Foole doesn't play trumpet either, and what he does do-- improvise with the acoustic guitar, his pliable voice, and whatever else is convenient-- speaks far less to any sort of virtuosity than Davis, even at his most insipid.</p><p>
    But, as a curator and facilitator of experimental recordings under his name, Foole may be the less-prolific Davis for the modern-American improvised psychedelic sphere. He's moved through the canons (a soul, folk, and punk devotee who's played all sorts of out-rock) to arrive at something peculiar and individual. He's done this by securing the aegis of better musicians. The Din, his backing band for two LPs in 1985, were a Mission of Burma variation. When he began performing as Dredd Foole &amp; the Din again-- and when he recorded the texturally fascinating <em>The Whys of Fire</em> in 2003-- he reached out to Thurston Moore, Jim O'Rourke, Matt Valentine, Erika Elder, and Jack Rose. On <em>Daze on the Mounts</em>, a newly remastered reissue of a 2004 short-run, CD-only release, Valentine and Elder (known best as MV &amp; EE) support him. It's not Davis' Coltrane, Evans, Adderley, Chambers, and Cobb, but it'll do.</p><p>
    Foole isn't just a magnet for out musicians, though his legendary status as ""Vermont's free-folk poet laureate"" (as described by Family Vineyard proprietor Eric Weddle in a 2005 <em>Dusted</em> review) might suggest otherwise. Foole works under such impressive auspices because his improvisations are interactive canvases, simultaneously absorbing and reflecting sound to give him and his collaborators new, invigorating frameworks. He's not a sponge.</p><p>
    With MV &amp; EE along for the ride, the Foole of <em>Daze</em> sounds like a shaman for tonality. His bleating, stop-or-slur syllabics languish in the same reverb-soaked pool as Valentine's guitars. On the opening ""Two Faces"", Elder's birdcall loop suggests an invocation to deliverance or an aubade for sunrise. It's a prickly, 11-minute drone in stark contrast to ""Feed the King"", the album's most sonically aggressive and limber track. Elder plays trumpet and Valentine plays moon flute. Foole loops the title phrase, layering his processed and plain invocations. It evokes the polyrhythms of South Africa and the soar of spirituals in one unhinged moment. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    But <em>Daze</em> is at its finest when Foole's words are decipherable, or at least familiar enough to allow for context and interpretation. The covers take that bait: Foole's trip on Love's ""Signed D.C."" was recorded in 2003, a full three years before Arthur Lee died from leukemia. Its inclusion here feels like tribute. When Lee wrote the song in 1966, it was an ode to Don Conka, whose struggle with heroin wrote him out of Love's debut. Conka wasn't dead when Lee recorded it, and Lee wasn't dead when Foole recorded it. Foole treats it like a dirge-in-waiting, distending the first cares in the line ""Nobody cares for me"" until it's like slow strangulation. He grabs the thought and wrestles it for two minutes. Valentine resurrects fragments of Lee's 1966 harmonica line, rising above Silvertone guitar improvisation that wobbles from murky pings to ghastly slides. Lugubrious, it's Lee's agony, free in hyperbole.</p><p>
    Similar exaggeration applies to ""Freedom"", a variation on J Mascis &amp; the Fog's ""Someone Said"". ""Someone said my freedom is gone,"" Foole sings, tripping over all of the syllables through nine minutes. It's not an anthem as much as it is evidence: Believe your freedom is gone and stand still, or hurdle beyond the bounds of your past at age of 57. And bring your friends with you. Now that's cool.<br/>

    I've seen a guide to the pronunciation of Gotye (""gore-ti-yeah"")
    and I'm still not sure I'm getting it right. In a lot of ways, it's a name built for the modern world-- difficult to say but extremely easy to search
    for on the Internet. Its very unpronuncability is what makes it stick in your
    brain. Gotye is one guy, Wally De Backer, who lives in Melbourne but originally
    hails from Belgium. He's a talented singer/songwriter/producer, emphasis on the
    singer part of that equation. His voice is precise yet malleable, running from
    smoothly soaring to roughly resigned, and his falsetto pierces like a light in
    the shadowy landscape of his music.</p><p>
<em>Like Drawing Blood</em>, De Backer's second Gotye LP, is full of dark pop,
    produced with an open clarity that separates the numerous sounds and
    consequently comes off as huge and sweeping. There's a definite ring of the 80s
    to it as well, with its deliberate drum programming, big synth pads and
    romantic melodicism. I could see Peter Gabriel doing ""Night Drive""
    for sure, given the vaguely global tinge added by the hints of tamboura at the
    beginning and the piles of hand percussion that bubble up at the end.</p><p>
    It's not the only feint toward worldbeat-- De Backer nods to Middle Eastern
    and South Asian modes and instrumentation on the opening verses of ""The
    Only Way"", both in his pentatonic vocal melody and the brief interrupting
    phrases played on a nasal instrument that sounds like a shenai but could just
    as easily be a synth or weirdly played sax. Horns play a big role in the
    album's most obvious single, the minor Aussie hit ""Learnalilgivinanlovin"",
    which opens with some pretty Spector-ish drums and launches into an insanely
    catchy tune backed with swelling horns and De Backer's many-tiered
    self-harmonizing. A baritone sax zigzags through the verses, teasing the vocals. It's a great song, even though it ends with a
    percussion solo. 
    </p>
<p>
    The other big standout-- ""Heart's a Mess""-- sounds a lot like its
    animated video looks. In the video, long-legged machine-creatures stalk a
    ravaged mechanical countryside in the moonlight and ultimately float off into
    space. A simple but effective organ figure balances De Backer's softly delivered
    verses with an off-kilter counterpart, egging him on to the song's climax, where he
    rises to a full shout on the lines ""It makes no sense/ But I'm desperate
    to connect."" Judging by the sounds here, the connection isn't going to
    happen anytime soon, and he'll probably be wandering in the moonlight for quite a
    while. 
    </p>
<p>
    By and large, <em>Like Drawing Blood</em> is at least close to this level, but
    I'm trying to figure out what happens in its last third. After the unexpected
    dub detour of ""Puzzle with a Piece Missing"", the album veers off
    course with ""A Distinctive Sound"", a sample-heavy DJ workout in the
    vein of the Avalanches and Amon Tobin. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's
    certainly incongruous and less satisfying and, ironically, also less distinct
    than De Backer's vocal turns. It's followed by a meandering, melodica-topped dub
    instrumental. While they won't send you running for the hills, the presence of
    these tracks is confusing, and it can't help feeling like they're shoved
    near the back of the running order for a reason. 
    </p>
<p>
    That doesn't make it a bad album, just a flawed one. At its worst, it feels
    like it's gone off on a tangent, but De Backer never fails to come back to his
    strengths, even if he sometimes takes a whole song to do it. On the whole, the
    balance comes out in his favor, and at its best, <em>Like Drawing

After years of exploiting rock culture's innate irreverence for tradition, while simultaneously reveling in punk's sub-dominant trait of restlessness, and yes, boredom, the band got its shit together. From 1995 to 2000, Boredoms shifted their sonic emphasis from zero-attention-span rock to meditation through repetition.</p><p>
    Boredoms' progression is almost perfectly documented on their <em>Super Roots</em> series: Seven EPs reissued by Vice containing the seeds of music found on their more widely available LPs, but more interestingly viewed as pivot points demonstrating how (and when) the band changed directions on their travels upward. I should note, I'm not generally a fan of detailing a band's progression this way. Often, it misleadingly dismisses their early stuff as ""undeveloped,"" or later stuff as somehow ""perfected."" To the contrary: I think there's something of interest on just about everything Boredoms released, but if the <em>Super Roots</em> records double as decent signposts for the trip, all the better reason to consider them apart from the other albums.</p><p>
<em>Super Roots 6</em> (1996) sounded like nothing else the band had released to that point-- or since. Although featuring instrumental contributions from all Boredoms members, the record smacks of Eye; indeed, he's credited with producing and co-mixing, and though he'd already started his DJ experiments by that time, it's very tempting to view <em>SR6</em> as the first in a progressively sought-after line of Eye-centric remixes. The record is by turns atmospheric, murky, propulsive and pretty, though with such evocative titles as ""01"" and ""0(x12)"", you may need to sit down and ""listen in"" rather than expect Boredoms' usual raucous anti-rock attack. ""6"" is music for swamps, featuring Yamamoto's detuned guitar, and low-pitched toms backed with sounds of water ripples and wind chimes. Its sickly ambience is offset by the psychedelic phasing and jittery funk on ""2"", or its slower, cut-up cousin ""9"". In fact, many songs appear to be constructed from bits and pieces of other tracks: ""10"" takes the beat from ""2"", slows it down, and adds an organ intro; ""7"", ""11"" and ""14"" all share the 4x4 tribal techno pound, though they're presented as frantic flail, spaceship drone and minimalist bleep-rock respectively. ""15"" is a somber, contemplative organ postlude to a record that defies expectations; <em>SR6</em> contains arguably Boredoms' most underrated music.</p><p>
    Enter Boredoms v3.0. After years of taking no-wave to strange heights, and hinting at a change to come on their mid-90s records, the band launched full-fledged rocketship rock on 1998's <em>Super Roots 7</em>. Arriving soon after their American breakthrough <em>Super æ</em>, <em>SR7</em> witnessed the band not only embracing the rhythm-first upward thrust of Can and Neu!, but also of constructing ""songs"" as massive, 20-minute vehicles for trance and primal transcendentalism. And they did this by covering the Mekons. Boredoms transform the beloved English punk band's ""Where Were You?"" into a work of magnificent, sparkling abandon, entitled ""7"" (not to be confused with ""7"" from <em>SR6</em>).</p><p>
    The EP contains three tracks, though the centerpiece is ""7→ (Boriginal)""; it begins with the sounds of crickets and Eye's whispering, ""super roots... seven"" before the engines start and a synth tone shoots up over capital-M Motorik. Soon, the guitars enter with the Mekons riff, and the track already fits in perfectly with anything on <em>Super æ</em> or <em>Vision Creation Newsun</em>-- it's just getting started. Minutes later, it moves into pristine psychedelic dance rock, gradually increasing in intensity for a few minutes before the floodgates open just past the 13-minute mark. And that's it: The promise of <em>SR3</em>'s hardcore trance, the suggestion that noise can be heavenly on <em>SR5</em>-- all of it crashes down at this moment in the song, and had the band never recorded another note, they could still be said to have perfected... whatever one calls this kind of music. The song splashes down with a mellow coda, sounding not unlike much of <em>SR6</em>, and though the EP ends with a curiously anticlimactic Eye remix of the tune, the thrill of the ""Boriginal"" resonates long after the music stops.</p><p>
<em>Super Roots 8</em> (1999) was released just before <em>VCN</em> and sounds perfectly at home in the latter day Boredoms canon. Like <em>SR7</em>, it consists of three tracks, the main of which is a cover. This time around, the song is ""Jungle Taitei"", originally the theme of a popular anime series of the same name (translated as ""Jungle Emperor""), composed by Isao Tomita. However, the vibe here is pure Boredoms: hi-speed techno exotica, congas, phased guitar harmonies, and a great, wordless vocal by Yoshimi (occasionally doubled by Eye). The song is perhaps the closest Boredoms ever came to releasing a straight ""pop"" song, though no track with Eye's signature cramming of as much percussion as inhumanly possible into his mixes is ever going to storm the top 40. His ""DJ Let's TRY &amp; D.I.Y. (Drum Machine Mix)"" is sparser, perhaps foretelling the kind of noises he'd make on the 2002 ""Endless Happiness"" remix for Black Dice, while Yann Tomita's mix slows the beat down by half, and turns everything lush and even more overtly psychedelic. Fans of this era of Boredoms will certainly want <em>SR8</em>, though it's less essential than the records Boredoms made immediately before or after.<br/>
<em><br/>
    Vision Creation Newsun</em> came out in Japan during summer 1999 as part of a limited edition (and still very collectible) box, and appeared as a single CD in 2000. Soon afterwards, as the story goes, Boredoms disappeared. Today, we have V∞rdoms, and though they radiate with a warm all their own, I'd be lying if I didn't admit to missing Boredoms. Of course, we still have the records, and their best moments haven't lost much in the decade since they were released. I almost envy those of you still unaware of all this bore-might: it was a long, strange trip to the sun. <br/></p></div>"|9927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9927-super-roots-678/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    energy of 2005's out-of-left-field <em>In the Kingdom of Kitsch You
    Will Be a Monster</em>, but with more tightly plotted, ultra-extended
    dynamics and a stretch of chillier, loopier atmospherics. In other words, it's a whole lot weirder than its predecessor. Last time, the
    hyperactive Norwegian quartet located a smoky Blue Note wrangle. That's here too, along with other signature Shining ingredients
    (crushing metal riffs, jazzy skronk bleats, dime-splitting time changes), but they also bring some <em>Switched-On Bach</em> and plenty of crystalline, near silence.</p><p>
    With a band this frantic, end results are
    bound to be uneven-- certain dervishes come off like mini-exercises,
    some stretches flop earthward, a few passages sound a tad
    familiar-- but then come the stunners, ringing out perfectly with a baroque stylishness
    and slaying explosiveness that, if maintained for an entire album,
    would suffocate the hearts of even the proggiest. That said, the incessant exploration and imperfections make for a more enjoyable, human listening: Refusing to follow threads to their natural conclusions, each bifurcation points toward a fascinating
    possibility even if that possibility doesn't pan out. The band's ""led"" by Jørgen Munkeby, who signed up with the over-crowded Jaga Jazzist at
    the tender age of 16. That was 10 years ago. When I saw Jaga in Oslo last summer they bored me, but a
    prodigy-on-the-loose's youthful energy is invested in every second of <em>Grindstone</em>'s
    crazy climb.</p><p>
    It isn't random. Shining know to put their best material first-- they've done it in the past, and here tracks one through three
    are the most compelling stand-alone compositions. For a few moments of the name-echoing opener, ""In the Kingdom of Kitsch You Will Be a Monster"", the boys lend a few extra fifes and
    gongs to Black Sabbath Jr. As on many of the tracks, what at first can
    seem like technical noodling develops a specific force over
    repeat listens. The vocals-- slicing and dicing the title into a few accented Art Blakey slivers-- serve as a drill-instructing percussion for a King
    Crimson spy movie drop-off.
    </p><p>
    Second track ""Winterreise"" -- dig the Schubert reference-- opens like Fucking
    Champs before introducing icicle jazz and then modern
    classical moments. Themes are repeated in pin-drop avalanches: A
    sighing saxophone, <em>Bitches Brew</em> wafts, dry heaves, a tinder piano, a drumstick's
    tap.  
    </p>
<p>
    Each of the early pieces is
    like this, but ""Stalemate Longan Runner"" offers the heaviest, crunchiest guitar
    riffs before giving way to a pastoral/chirpy childlike Nobukazu Takemura tableau, more heart-rate guitars, and synthy bomb drops. Then, yup, more Bach or Schubert or whatever. It's sorta cyclical.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    After
    that stunning opening triad, ""To Be Proud of Crystal Colors Is to Live
    Again"", a brief toy box tinkle, is almost silent. As the album
    continues, the earlier rock drops out, and the album almost
    seems to disappear. It's pretty-- as if the strands of the bookmarks
    separate momentarily for easier scientific study. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Moonchild
    Mindgames"" is old school muted horn with piano. Silver Apples on harp
    with voices that, really, conjure Animal Collective. There's guitar
    feedback for the final minute, but with, again, a tinny angel sound
    threaded through it. Increasing the jazz ramble, ""The Red Room"" double-times sax against
    drum rumbles and joyfully short-distance hand claps. The
    last two tracks bring back the fuzz: ""1:4:9"" has a Boris lift-off
    guitar that's exacting while treading water against the wind:
    Kabuki dramatics with a tease and some of ""Psalm""'s gothy squeal (check the female soprano in both pieces). After some noise and lapping skree, ""Fight Dusk
    With Dawn"" tweaks past tracks as faintly remembered, shuffled echoes (listen, for instance, for ""Goretex Weather Report"" from the last record. Or, this album's opener). 
    </p>
<p>
    The
    play-by-play's necessary because for all of its oddities, <em>Grindstone</em> relies on its neighbors, gliding  insistently from rock to fragile
    snow drift to feedbacking silly string to a rather grand anti-grand exit. It took dozens of listens to catch the refractions: The pieces within each track
    came together easily; the album itself proved more of a puzzle. It's refreshing to chart the geography-- the permafrost center, especially, packs a mountain of intrigue. Think of it as a palimpsest subdivided. For a long while I wasn't sure, but discovering
    the morse code holding this thing together has given it a plot and a shape that keeps thickening.

    After 2003's <em>Beet, Maize &amp; Corn</em>,
    Sean O'Hagan undertook a project with artist Pierre Muller to create
    ""Musical Wheel"", a web-based collaboration between O'Hagan's music
    and Muller's paintings. Those who've followed the High Llamas over the past
    decade and a half, however, may have seen that project as simply a continuation
    of what O'Hagan had been doing all along. After all, even the Llamas' album covers-- from the transparent modernist linearity of <em>Gideon Gaye</em>'s
    cover collage (a skyscraper, village houses, and a castle juxtaposed against an expressionistic sunrise) to <em>Hawaii</em>'s<em> </em>Howard Finster
    folk art style and bold vacation
    brochure lettering, to the modernist simplicity
    of <em>Snowbug </em>and<em> Buzzle Bee-- </em>have always mirrored the music.</p><p>
    Though he's garnered constant (yet fair) comparisons throughout his career to
    Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach, Sean O'Hagan's music under the High Llamas banner is as much a pastiche as
    those album covers. While his delicate melodies and motley arrangements certainly
    channel his 60s pop heroes, his clear affinity for the bucolic British
    countryside suggests a similar affinity for the pristine studio-bound
    daydreams of XTC's <em>Skylarking</em> and <em>Apple Venus, Vol. 1</em>.</p><p>
    What clearly sets the High Llamas apart, however, is
    O'Hagan's tendency toward retro-futurism, which results in the
    unique confluence of string quartets with hi-fi lounge-pop instrumentation
    (organ, vibraphone, clarinet), occasionally drifting toward exotica, the late-50s big band- and Latin-influenced instrumental music that attempted to
    evoke lush, tropical, and faraway imagined lands. The danger of this approach,
    of course, is that High Llamas songs are often (especially lately)
    overburdened, with excessive ingredients outweighing songcraft. Thankfully, <em>Cladders</em>
    avoids this crutch, and consequently emerges as the most enjoyable High
    Llamas record in over a decade.</p><p>
<em>Can Cladders</em> finds O'Hagan balancing his arch musical tendencies with a
    bounce and sway nearly absent from its largely rhythmless predecessor.
    ""Winter's Day"", a blithely told tale of an art theft, opens with a
    clop-clop canter before giving way to multi-tracked female voices vamping the
    titular phrase over jazz guitar and rolling piano. It's as close to blue-eyed
    soul as O'Hagan gets, and, along with the cooed doo-wop chorus of ""Clarion
    Union Hall"", suggests his appreciation for the willowy R&amp;B
    of Scritti Politti. Similarly, the ska-inflected verses of
    ""Honeytrop"" give way to the ethereal strings of its chorus, and on
    ""Bacaroo"", a lonely, minimalist organ swing periodically emerges from
    its gossamer surroundings, only to quickly disappear again.</p><p>
    O'Hagan's unique lyrical approach remains intact, with each song a distinct,
    finely detailed set piece. After establishing the scene of ""The Old
    Spring Town"" with ""The frost is on the ground, and the ferry's far
    away,"" he resurrects <em>Hawaii</em>'s touristic wanderlust with a
    question: ""How many times have you been to Mexico?"" On ""Sailing
    Bells"", O'Hagan's attention is drawn from the ships at sea to the sounds
    around him, as well as the particular manner in which ""the little rocks
    lay low on the tideline."" ""Dorothy Ashby"" is <em>Cladders</em>'
    most affecting moment, with O'Hagan eulogizing the jazz harpist in her own
    element: ""Down the concrete steps and into the nightclub/ These are folk
    who fare above us all/ Feel the music's sad and gentle fall."" 
    </p>
<p>
    The High Llamas share Drag City label space with the
    most currently prominent harpist, Joanna Newsom, whose musical ambition makes
    O'Hagan look like Joey Ramone in comparison. It's fitting, then, that <em>Cladders</em>' penultimate track is the playful singalong ""Rollin'"", on which O'Hagan, no
    longer content to stand back and observe his surroundings, steps into his own
    canvas and simply says ""Hi"" to the landscape himself. For an artist
    who often finds himself overthinking his craft, it's definitely a refreshing
    diversion.

It's all good clean fun, and there's no limit to Jamaican music's demand for party-starting voicings of the biggest riddims. He's certainly the right man for the job, too-- after all they don't call him ""The Energy God"" for nothing. But go back a few years and things were much more promising.</p><p>
    From 2000 to 2002 the young O'Neil Bryant released three albums on Greensleeves: <em>Comin' 4 U</em>, <em>Log On</em>, and <em>Higher Level</em>. This is the period concentrated on by <em>Monsters Of Dancehall: The Energy God</em>. Right from the beginning, he was a Master of Ceremonies to be reckoned with, hyping crowds with streams of ass-shaking orders, but in amongst the hype-man routine lay a lyrical sophistication we simply don't see today.</p><p>
    This ability to flip on a dime from badman badinage and menacingly precise chatting to resort-rep pep secured his place at the top of the tree for close on two full years-- no mean feat in dancehall, a music where careers are made, broken, and often resurrected again in less than one. Sadly it's tough to imagine he'll ever get back to such a point again, especially now that a major deal has been inked with P Diddy's Bad Boy Records.</p><p>
    Always there with a snappy catchphrase-- ""shizzle my nizzle,"" ""run for cover, save your mama,"" and ""bomb a drop!""-- Ele was never scared of appearing ridiculous, a fact largely responsible for his popularity and borne out by tracks including ""On Line"" and ""Give Her It Good"". However, he also knew when to play down the silliness and put on a serious face, as shown on ""Bad Man a Bad Man"" and ""Replacement Killer"".</p><p>
    Featuring productions by Byron Murray, Donovan Bennett, King Jammys, Steven ""Lenky"" Marsden, Jeremy Harding, Stone Love's Winston ""Wee Pow"" Powell, and Cordel ""Scatta"" Burrell, this album also serves as a collection of some of the best riddims of the early millennial golden age of digital dancehall. Tide-turning instrumentals such as the <em>Coolie Dance</em> (""Genie Dance""), the <em>Egyptian</em> (""Egyptian Dance""), and the <em>Diwali</em> (""Elephant Message"") are all present. Meanwhile, the 9/11-referencing ""The Bombing"" points at a certain naïve political consciousness. Unfortunately, this doesn't extend to ""Log On""'s homophobic ranting.</p><p>
    Still, if you can look past that, <em>Monsters of Dancehall</em> offers bittersweet thrills, both as a cracking retrospective of an artist's past glories and a suggestion that he'll never reach those heights again.<span></span></p></div>"|9923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9923-monsters-of-dancehall-the-energy-god/|6.8|Dave Stelfox

Six (aka Patrick Gubler)-- it features fewer nods to British luminaries like Bert Jansch, fuller instrumentation, and more MOR country-rock. This isn't a bad thing, and it's often very pretty, but it's hardly something you'd guess was the work of a former member of a seminal noise outfit like Tower Recordings. There's less of the experimental folk or abstract interludes that marked his earlier work, and it's great to hear Gubler exploring a more accessible, less deliberately obscure route. His songwriting has become more pop-minded, providing a better platform for lyrics and melody. This should be a good thing-- if only those lyrics had something to say. Working within a genre doesn't mean the lyrics have to be tired and cliché, yet the disc's first big hook, ""The Dance"", has a clunker of a chorus: ""But I wonder if you dance/ Are your eyes fixed on each other in romance/ I'm not askin' for another chance."" Garth Brooks did this song better like 18 years ago.</p><p>
    Gubler's voice is hushed, and he has difficulty with compositions that spotlight the words and singing (note whatever he ""must bear-ahair-hare"" on ""The Dance""), but he often calls in background vocalists to bolster him, and sometimes even hands songs over to other performers, as he does with Helen Rush on ""The End of Winter"". We can talk growth and full-band arrangements all day, but hearing Rush's placid, assured voice come in after a full minute of unhurried acoustic plucking might be the record's one true goosebump-raising moment.</p><p>
    Coming immediately after that, ""I've Been Traveling"" is a real surprise, a jangly Byrdsian overdose with some more lazy lyrics (""daydreaming about your wine-stained lips,"" and ""maybe someday when things ease up I'll be making my way to you""). It seems like a palette-cleansing moment, and it's a testament to the disc's diversity but not much else. ""Bless These Blues"" is another stretch for Gubler with a sunny melody and an organ that lurches like a water-logged duck, but the sentiment on this one-- ""Bless these blues that I'm feeling... I was going through the motions/ Now at last I am awake""-- scratches at something deeper.
    </p><p>
    Jeffery Cain cover ""Not I the Seed"" weds more straightforward strumming with washes of guitar, pedal steel, and other other incidental noise, and here Gubler finds a middle-ground between experimentation and songcraft that the record could use more of. ""Lily of the West"" is a quiet acoustic, straight-ahead run through of a traditional folk song, but again, this is contrasted with the faux-soul Hammond-driven ""Sweet Music"", a complete 180 from what came before. Maybe it's just a muddled track list that makes <em>Slightly Sorry</em> seem inconsistent. It's not the bolder instrumentation that does it, and it's not the guests on the record, either. It's hearing Gubler try his hand in new contexts, while still hearing the old ones in which his whisper worked so well, that's the most frustrating.

    Listening to Charlie Louvin's new album of old songs is like
    hearing your grandfather sing hymns. The 80-year-old country music
    veteran has the warm and easy authority of someone who has spent his entire
    life with these songs; he knows every word, every melody, every implication by
    heart. His voice, hardened by experience, sounds worn
    and weary, especially compared to his popular material of 50 years ago. Most of
    all it sounds lonely, as if it were created by God specifically to
    harmonize with his brother Ira Louvin, who died in 1965.</p><p>
    In a perfect world, Charlie Louvin would need no
    introduction, but while his acolytes are well-known (his songs have been
    covered by Johnny Cash, Alison Krauss, Gram Parsons-era Byrds, and Uncle
    Tupelo, to name just a few), the Louvin Brothers themselves are perhaps most
    famous to a mainstream audience for the silly cover of their 1960 album <em>Satan Is Real</em>. Born Ira and Charles
    Loudermilk in rural Alabama, the
    brothers began singing together professionally in the early 1940s. After a
    decade of paying their dues, they signed with Capitol Records, lodged an
    impressive number of hits in the country top ten, and became regulars at the
    Grand Ole Opry. Their story is as epic and indelibly American as Johnny
    Cash's, full of tragedy and redemption. The brothers were as different from one
    another as could be: While Charlie remained reserved and devoted to the
    Christian life they sang about, Ira is well documented as being an alcoholic
    with a raging temper and a womanizer with four wives. Charlie split the group in
    1963; Ira was finally getting his life back together when he was killed by a
    drunk driver.</p><p>
    Although he's been playing shows for decades,<em> Charlie Louvin</em> is, surprisingly, his
    first real solo album. It's mostly full of old songs like ""Great Atomic Power"", the
    murder ballad ""Knoxville Girl"", ""When I Stop Dreaming"", and the Carter Family's
    ""Kneeling Drunkard's Plea"", re-recorded in his aged voice and with a roster
    of admirers-- young artists like Jeff Tweedy, Will
    Oldham, and Clem Snide's Eef Barzelay,  as well as older guard like Tom T. Hall, George Jones, Bobby Bare Sr., Marty
    Stuart, and Chip Young, who played guitar for Elvis. Most of these tracks stick
    to a midtempo pace to accommodate Louvin's vocals, but ""Kneeling Drunkard's
    Plea"" nicely slows down to sound like a hymn, with a congregation of backing
    voices lending the chorus a subtle solemnity. And uptempo numbers like ""Worried
    Man Blues"" and closer ""My Long Journey Home"" sound like front-porch jams that give
    the musicians a chance to show off their picking skills.
    </p>
<p>
    The newbies don't come across very well on <em>Charlie Louvin</em>. Both Barzalay and Oldham
    get less than a verse, ostensibly enough to get their names on the bill, but not
    enough to make their marks on the songs. Sounding like a city slicker, Elvis
    Costello brings his usual oily polish to his verse, and on the otherwise tender
    ""Grave on the Green Hillside"" Joy Lynn White belts out her lines aggressively,
    overpowering the gentler performances of Louvin and Tift Merritt. It's the old
    timers who really shine on <em>Charlie Louvin</em>.
    George Jones sings well with Louvin on opener ""Must You Throw Dirt in My Face""
    and ""Waiting for a Train"", and Bare and Hall have a blast on ""Blues Stay Away

<p>
    But this is Louvin's show, and he doesn't need
    anyone's assistance selling these songs. There is real character in his voice
    and an instinctive grace in his phrasing. For that reason, the album's best
    moment is the sole new song, ""Ira"". A simple song that sweetly expresses
    Charlie's enormous loss, it's a poignant tribute not simply to Ira but to Ira's
    high tenor, which Charlie professes to hear in his head whenever he sings the
    old songs. ""Ira, I still hear you, your sweet harmony off in the distance,""
    Charlie sings, steadfast in his conviction that they'll harmonize again in
    heaven.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite the history behind these songs, <em>Charlie Louvin</em> never exploits his age or legend for the kind of
    cheap gravitas that Johnny Cash's <em>American Recordings </em>series occasionally
    lapsed into. Credit goes to Louvin as well as to producer Mark Nevers of
    Lambchop, who corrals all the musicians and keeps things upbeat and airy. Occasionally,
    his production sounds a little gimmicky-- the guitar feedback on ""Great Atomic
    Power"", the ghostly mandolin on ""Ira""-- but his best decision here is to end not
    with a solemn number, but with Bill Monroe's quick-stepping ""My Long Journey
    Home"". A duet with Paul Burch, the song rambles amiably, showcasing Chris
    Scruggs' banjo picking and Louvin's earthy musicality. Title aside, the song
    isn't commemorative, but celebratory as it closes the album on a high note.

Though it's not as if the Besnard Lakes were unfairly denied their due, having released a gauzy 2003 debut that was heavy on languorous shoegazer jangle/drone, but low on personality and vigor.</p><p>
<em>The Dark Horse</em> shares that album's deliberate sense of pacing, precious attention to detail and hermetic sound-world atmosphere; the difference here is that almost every song builds to a crucial moment where the Besnards bravely step out of the shadows, and in the process, transform from being a merely good band to a great one.  And just as the individual tracks ascend to their own internal peaks, so too does the eight-song sequence as a whole, which means patience is certainly a virtue here: Opener ""Disaster"" begins as a swell of forlorn falsettos and weepy strings (courtesy of in-house arranger Nicole Lizee and moonlighting Godspeed violinist Sophie Trudeau) that yields to a slumberous chorus of Brian Wilson harmonies; ""For Agent 13"" is all slow-dissolving, ladies-and-gentleman-we-are-floating-in-Spiritualized tremolos and mournful coos that sound like they're coming from a castrated Sigur Rós.</p><p>
    It's not until the third track, ""And You Lied to Me"", that <em>The Dark Horse</em> really achieves lift-off, and not without some great effort: the song seems to be deliberately working against its itself with its Floydian glide, oddly timed drum rolls at the chorus and frequent pauses filled in with strange, indecipherable murmurs. But finally, at the 4:56, we hit pay dirt: after a brief stop, the drums kick in and guitarist Steve Raegele and guest Jonathan Cummins (ex of the Doughboys, currently of Bionic) blast into a glorious two-way duel worthy of its own planetarium laser show. And then instead of coming down, the Besnards turn it up another notch thanks to bassist/Lacek's belle Olga Goreas' star turn on ""Devastations"", a hellacious, fuck-the-man screen delivered in 70s-smooth girly harmonies that provide an uncanny contrast to song's monstrous psych-metal groove and-- oh yes-- climactic three-way drum solo.
    </p><p>
    Together, these two songs form the front half of <em>The Dark Horse</em>'s awesome middle stretch, but their playful bombast is effectively counterbalanced by the two songs that follow: ""Because Tonight"" is the album's most moving performance, a swaying space-rock ballad that intensifies into a beautifully bawling chorus; ""Ride the Rails"" is its most foreboding, with a circular bass riff and ominous violin inflections that lend it an ominous allure. It's also the song that best exemplifies Lacek's recurring lyrical strategy of trading off between World War II-era imagery and the present tense, with verses told through the eyes of a desperate drifter (""Gotta find a better to go on"") and a chorus (""my father rides the rails"") that shifts the perspective to a contemporary third-person telling. So it figures that the one song with an identifiably modern setting-- Brooklyn set piece ""On Bedford and Grand""-- is the one that ultimately breaks <em>The Dark Horse</em>'s dreamlike spell, an amiable but uneventful fuzz-pop exercise on which the Besnards come off as just another band of shoegaze revivalists.
    </p>
<p>
    But as sprightly Beach Boys pastiche ""Cedric's War"" gallops triumphantly to the finish line, you realize what's really remarkable about <em>The Dark Horse</em>: that for all its epic intimations and interstellar overdriving, the album still clocks in at a lean 45 minutes. Clearly, the Besnard Lakes are the product of a generation that remembers when their favorite albums used to fit perfectly on one side of a C90. But they've retrofitted classic-rock grandeur to indie-rock dimensions and forged their own special niche-- space-rock that's down to Earth.

    The La's are a band surrounded by myth and critical reverence. Their story
    is a frustrating tale of thwarted perfectionism and unfulfilled potential that
    still doesn't have a proper ending. Formed in 1986, they immediately
    established a reputation as an excellent live band in their native Liverpool,
    and leader Lee Mavers made his mark as a songwriter of enormous talent. Mavers
    penned the band's whole catalog, save for one collaboration with bassist John
    Power, but he was never satisfied with the studio recordings of most of their songs.</p><p>
    This perfectionism is somewhat excessive-- the band's sole album, a
    self-titled disc finally released in 1990 after many failed attempts to record
    it, is actually pretty good, if not quite what Mavers and his mates wanted it
    to be. It's one of those records that I read about for years, a
    you-have-to-hear-it album for many that sounded good but unspectacular when I
    finally heard it. Listening to this new collection of BBC sessions, I can see
    why the band was disappointed with the way it came out. <em>The La's</em> frankly sounds
    limp and watery relative to the fierce, adrenalized performances on <em>BBC in
    Session</em>, which instantly has become the more essential purchase of the two.</p><p>
    Drawn from four sessions, one a year from 1987 to 1990, these seventeen
    tracks include versions of most of their debut along with three non-album cuts.
    Tellingly, Mavers and Power are the only two members present for every date, as
    they cycled through three guitarists and four drummers. That flux in membership
    may partly explain why Mavers could never quite get the sound he heard in his
    head. While I'm not sure exactly what he was aiming for, it's hard to imagine
    most of these songs ever sounding better than they do here in all their raw
    glory. 
    </p>
<p>
    The first session, featuring a lineup that had already changed from the
    band's original incarnation, is the most relaxed of the four, opening with a
    measured version of ""Doledrum"" and a swaying take on ""Way
    Out"". Mavers plays acoustic rhythm guitar, leaving Paul Hemmings plenty of
    space for his electric leads. The revelation of the session is the B-side
    ""Come In Come Out"", a funky track with bluesy touches from Hemmings
    and Mavers at his catchy best. 
    </p>
<p>
    In a way, the sessions outline a mental progression for the band, beginning
    in an easy-going vein and growing more urgent as the years pass and an album
    remains elusive. The second session opens with a version of ""Son of a
    Gun"" that destroys the album version they recorded two years later. And
    the band's most enduring anthem, the effervescent ""There She Goes"",
    is a great deal more muscular but no less sweetly memorable in this rendition,
    with a fantastically varied backing track. Both the '88 and '90 sessions
    include storming versions of ""I Can't Sleep"", but I have to give the
    nod to the earlier take for the sheer unpolished bravado it displays,
    particularly in Ian Templeton's unhinged drumming. 
    </p>
<p>
    We get five songs from '89, definitely topped by ""Calling All"", a
    song that at one point was slated to be the title track of the band's debut
    album. It wound up being left off entirely for reasons unclear-- it's their
    toughest song, with a nasty rhythm track, Spanish guitar flourishes, and a
    breakdown that sounds like a blueprint for the mid-section of Nirvana's
    ""Drain You"". A year later, they played it again, this time even rougher
    and harder. Mavers sounds like he's trying to sing through the instrumentation
    rather than over it, and it's interesting to hear the difference in the way his
    brother Neil approaches the song on the drum kit versus the tack Chris Sharrock
    took a year prior. Sharrock's drumming is heavy on carefully tuned toms and
    auxiliary percussion, an almost melodic approach, while Neil Mavers brings a
    thumping, visceral style that gives the song a completely different kind of
    energy. Either way, they're both astounding takes of the song. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's hard to believe that the band on the last session is the same one that
    recorded <em>The</em> <em>La's</em>, mostly due to the fact that they sound so inspired, and
    it's weird that they couldn't duplicate the feel of the session in a different
    studio. It seems they may have simply put too much pressure on themselves
    recording the album to get what they really wanted. They hated what they wound
    up with, and though Mavers apparently did try to record a second album, it was
    never finished. Power went on to found Cast, while Mavers simply faded away,
    only to re-emerge at a La's reunion in 2005. He'd claimed before that 2007
    would see a new La's album (perhaps a long-purported re-recording of the first
    one?), but that remains to be seen. In the meantime, <em>BBC in Session</em> is
    the closest thing to a definitive document of the band.

    progress, amusement parks and lecture halls, personality litmus and
    social currency. What any of this means in relation to music is
    constantly changing, but songs, like all stories, have one invariable
    function: To raise a human voice against loneliness and anxiety.
    Eschewing the complex calculus of what makes music ""good,"" David
    Karsten Daniels' first widely available LP, <em>Sharp Teeth</em>, is a reminder of what makes it necessary. Daniels
    is interested in little besides telling you a few stories you've
    probably heard before, in the familiar way that you've heard them,
    creating some truly arresting musical moments along the way.</p><p>
    It requires a lot of skill to make the familiar sing seductively to an audience accustomed to novelty, and Daniels turns his creative imagination toward balancing the wheel instead of inventing a new one. If his indie-folk instrumentation and allegorical lyrics are staunchly post-Will Oldham in character, Daniels' whip-smart composition and unequivocal delivery distinguish his music in that crowded field. <em>Sharp Teeth</em> also evokes a folky Built to Spill with Daniels' reedy yet resonant voice and arrangements that amplify with each sweeping pass. ""The Dream Before the Ring That Woke Me"", the song-in-the-round that most purely expresses this aspect of Daniels' songwriting, swirls around one refrain: ""There is a feeling you just can't explain/ There is a joy that you can't contain."" It starts with just Daniels' voice and an acoustic strum, and then gradually introduces an angelic chorus, flickering organs, a supple rhythm section, and honeyed strings. By the song's close, it's bursting at its incandescent seams.</p><p>
    These tactics-- the majestic crescendo and the use of musical embellishments to underscore lyrical themes-- recur throughout the album. Amid the wispy blues of ""Jesus and the Devil"", which brims with offhanded religious doubt and clever inversions, sudden bleating horns spill out like ""the road [that] is long"". On ""Minnows"", busy-bee strings flit, building a pressure that hitches, pauses, and exhales satisfyingly into a magisterial chorus. ""Beast"" and ""We Go Right On"" follow suit, beginning tremulously and closing emphatically. In ""American Pastime"", Daniels sings that he's ""not cut out for the major leagues."" Given indie-folk's meager foothold in the mainstream, he's probably right, but there's nothing minor about his talent.</p></div>"|9885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9885-sharp-teeth/|7.4|Brian Howe

The Missouri-born, Brooklyn-based TK Webb takes plenty of musical cues from late electric bluesmen (see R.L. Burnside, Junior Kimbrough), but manages to fold in enough disparate bits to keep his second full-length LP, <em>Phantom Parade</em>, from ever devolving into blind, dull homage.</p><p>
    Webb has been playing around New York for years, and he's an accomplished enough guitarist and harmonica player that <em>Phantom Parade</em> can be appreciated for its craftsmanship alone. But it's more interesting to squint, lean into your speaker, and try to conjure the dusty spines of Webb's record collection: ""Wet Eyed Morn"" sounds an awful lot like early, Angola-era Leadbelly, with Webb growling over scratchy acoustic strums and thick, buzzing harmonica, his voice as hard and dreary as Louisiana prison walls. ""The Spade"", <em>Phantom Parade</em>'s poppiest, most optimistic cut, dips into alt-country, echoing late Steve Earle and Bobby Bare Jr., while the fuzz-soaked stomper ""Classy"" sounds more like indie-blues circa 2002 (think Black Keys).</p><p>
<em>Phantom Parade</em> is packed with dirty, electric blues songs, but still manages to feel intimate and soft, like Webb and his band are sprawled out on your back porch, drinking warm beer: These songs are friendly, and you'll want to take them with you. Raucous, repetitive opener ""The Desert"" seems like the appropriate soundtrack for rolling down a deserted Delta highway, counting Baptist churches and catfish ponds, hoping, desperately, to spot another set of headlights. ""Lesser Dude"" is a loose, downtrodden lament about the fumbled opportunities that lead to hanging out in parking lots, with wily guitar riffs, steady drums, a bit of piano, and Webb's tired, Tom Waits-ian groans. </p><p>
    The blues have been pillaged more liberally (and excessively, and unapologetically) than nearly any other facet of American music, and with good reason: The music of the Mississippi Delta is so strange, complex, and urgent that once you've listened well, it becomes increasingly hard to find anything as interesting. Webb manages to find some comfortable middle ground between well-worn Delta despair and modern technique (and humor), and <em>Phantom Parade</em> is a welcome addition to the contemporary blues songbook.</p></div>"|9893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9893-phantom-parade/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

Listeners want the impression     that an artist sings from experience, that she lives the life she sings about     in her songs. Whether it's actually true or not is beside the point. There's no     doubt that Lucinda Williams writes what she knows: On two exceptional albums (<i>Lucinda Williams</i> and <i>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</i>), one really     good one (<i>Sweet Old World</i>), and two decent     late-career installments (<i>Essence</i> and     <i>World Without Tears)</i>, she's     chronicled her personal romantic ups and downs, the uncertainties that haunt her,     and her own Southernness even when regional differences are breaking down. With     her divisive vocals and incisive lyrics, it's easy-- maybe too easy-- to     regard the singer as indistinguishable from her songs' characters. But she asks for it. Despite her reputation for being     lonesome, orn'ry, and mean, the ease with which she expresses herself in     country songwriting fueled her legend even when she took nearly a decade     between albums.</p>
<p>With     her dreary, deeply disappointing new album, <i>West</i>,     which was inspired by the death of her mother and yet another bad break-up, Williams     might be getting a little <i>too</i> personal. These songs aren't just about her; they     sound like they're written specifically <i>for</i> her, with a larger audience only a     dim concern. She employs structural quirks-- eccentric repetitions and     digressions, purposefully monotone melodies, talking-blues (read: bad rap) delivery,     unjustified song lengths-- like defense mechanisms, keeping listeners from     digging too deeply into her songs or identifying too strongly with her. This     time she seems to be writing to keep people out, fortressing  herself against audience expectations. That     evasiveness could be interesting, but here it simply leads to shoddy     songwriting and lazily bland music.</p>
<p>Consider     ""Are You Alright?"", whose status as the album's lead-off track and first single     suggests it's the most accessible song on <i>West</i>.     In the span of five minutes, Williams repeats the title 22 times (that's     roughly half the lyrics), which seems a little gutsy, if not outright testy. At     first it works: the repetition is hypnotic, like a worrisome thought that won't     leave your brain, and the bridge, which contains the album's strongest melodic     passage, complements that foreboding nicely. As the song proceeds, it becomes     clear she isn't building on that repetition, so it becomes a little grating.     Nevertheless, ""Are You Alright?"" proves to be one of the better tracks on <i>West</i>, although you'd probably skip it if     it were on any other album.</p>
<p>On     <i>West</i> as on her two previous albums, Williams     seems to be trying to free herself from the verse-chorus-verse prison, to find     new ways to assemble the same song parts. That's admirable in itself, but here     her alternatives don't work. After a passable chorus, ""Mama You Sweet""     digresses into a lengthy tangent tracking the course of pain through a body.     Ambiguity is the point: Is the pain her mother's illness or her own grief? Yet     it's described so indulgently it sounds goth. On ""Wrap My Head Around That"",     Williams works herself into lyrical knots with her scrawled spoken-word     delivery, and she draws out the lite-jazz groove for nine unnecessary minutes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere,     <i>West</i> is not so much frustrating as just     plain bad. ""Fancy Funeral"" warns against honoring the dead too much, and in its     description of an overly lush ceremony, the old Lucinda emerges, but the song's     concerns are so pecuniary that buyer's remorse overshadows any actual grief. In     the past, Williams has shown a propensity for blatant moon-june-spoon rhymes,     which have worked on previous songs (on title track from <i>Essence</i>, for example, the simplicity of the rhyme scheme feeds the     song's overwhelming lust). On <i>West</i>, however,     it sounds careless. Here's a verse from ""Come On"", a bilious kiss-off that     descends into dumb double entendres:</p>
<p><i>You weren't even worth it<br/> I'm sorry I ever flirted<br/> The effort wasn't even     concerted<br/> You didn't even make me,     come on!</i></p>
<p>""Come     On"" at least tries to churn up some rock momentum and give Lucinda a platform     to rage against the men who wrong her. The song still fizzles, but the effort     is appreciated. But every track seems to sulk along at the same midtempo pace,     with the same formless AOR pap that drains the music of melody and all regional     specificity. This is ""roots"" music in only the most general sense. Marked by     tasteful percussion and ketchupy guitar lines, the production (by Williams and     Hal Willner) nods to folk, blues, country, and decades-old rock and roll     without actually incorporating any of these styles into the arrangements. If     once Williams held these sounds dear enough to meld her personal lyrics to     their traditional frameworks, on <i>West</i> she discards them for a generic mush.</p>
<p>Worst     of all, the heartbreak that has been a defining theme in her music sounds newly     tedious, the romantic conflicts manufactured. Partly her lyrics are to blame:     they incorporate too many common nouns and too few proper ones, and the     concrete imagery has given way to vague self-help clichés (the title of     ""Learning How to Live"" says it all) and outright nonsense (on the laughable     ""What If"", she asks, in all seriousness, ""What if cats walked on water/And     birds had bank accounts?""). On <i>West</i> Williams breaks the first rule of any sort of creative writing: Show, don't     tell. She spends so much time rambling about her pain that she never bothers     even to try to make us feel it.</p></div>"|9912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9912-west/|3.5|Stephen M. Deusner

The aforementioned post-rock ensembles like to tinker with musical narrative like the post-modernists they are, and for every bold crescendo, an incongruous tangent can disrupt the music's linearity. But EITS works with classical narrative arcs-- tension and release, conflict and resolution, fatigue and redemption-- producing records that provoke both the satisfaction and the ennui that attend their time-honed methods.</p><p>
<em>All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone</em> is no exception, trafficking in the obvious and preordained. As always, elongated guitar shapes contort through various stages of dim shimmer and blinding incandescence. As always, you could fit the esoteric instrumentation through the eye of a needle. As always, the action unfolds with the adrenaline-rationing precision of a big-budget action flick, with climaxes that feel at once thrilling and safe, constrained by the four borders of a figurative screen.</p><p>
    It would be pointless to discuss this album on a song-by-song basis, since each funnels different permutations of chords and changes into the same inflexible template. It would be like trying to describe Legos by talking about helicopters and fortresses instead of brightly colored blocks of interlocking plastic. So let's consider the template itself. The foundation of EITS's aesthetic is the marriage of raw power and delicate beauty, and they've definitely honed the formula to weapon-caliber impact. The quiet parts, dominated by trembling strands of silvery guitar, are unaccountably tense, while the screaming guitar meltdowns they always lead to retain a pleasant lullaby quality, so that each mode holds the other in balanced suspension. There are the inevitable moments when one guitar breaks free from the others to slam home a more direct version of the song's melodic theme, and the climactic freakouts that inevitably signal the song's impending deconstruction.
    </p><p>
    What EITS essentially does is to write indie rock choruses and stretch them into long instrumentals, circling around a simple yet obscured central melody until they close in on it with predictable impact, all in a blatantly telegraphed soft/loud dynamic. <em>All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone</em> is the musical equivalent of a late Woody Allen film (possibly a good or bad thing, depending on your temperament): The action unfolds predictably, but the dramatic effect can also be increased by your fondness for and familiarity with the idiom.

But it also felt a bit like a coffin. After all, something this massive and career-defining-- it even ended with a new peak, the 100-guitar title piece-- seemed insurmountable. How could Chatham ever top it?</p><p>
    Apparently the answer lies in simple math. If 100 guitars could sound so great, shouldn't 400 sound even better? In 2005, Chatham set out to test this theorem. Commissioned by the City of Paris to compose something for their all-night La Nuit Blanche Festival, he wrote the ambitious ""A Crimson Grail (Moves Too Fast To See)."" Gathering 400 guitarists (along with longtime comrades Ernie Brooks on bass and Jonathan Kane on hi-hat) and four leaders listening to his directions through headphones, Chatham led a 12-hour sonic marathon. Starting on the steps of France's largest church, the Sacré-Cœur, the ensemble ended the show inside, beneath a 272-foot ceiling. Nearly 1000 people witnessed this mini-miracle, while thousands more watched on television throughout France.</p><p>
    Given the huge mass of bodies and sound, it would be unreasonable to expect the recording to replicate this spectacle. But audio limitations become a blessing on this album, which excerpts the performance in three 20-minute chunks. Slightly hissy and foggy, at times even claustrophobic, the record sounds like the abstracted essence of electric guitar. Sure, you can hear a chord here, a string pluck there, and the clicking of Kane's cymbal throughout ""Part Two"". But the lasting impression is that of a vibrant, shimmering sound-cloud. Chatham's ensemble creates an atmosphere that rises above individual technique, leaving concerns of who, what, and how far behind.  </p><p>
    Given that engrossing tone, <em>A Crimson Grail</em>'s three parts are surprisingly distinct. ""Part One"" is the most symphonic, as guitar waves alternately gather into peaks and cascade into near-silence. Uncannily, the guitars climb separately in small shifts, yet invariably meet at each apex. As the echoes lengthen, the piece evokes a huge frozen wave, full of dense overtones and hymn-like hums. The cinematic drift of the Kranky roster and the power-drones of Phill Niblock come to mind, but the glow of Chatham's guitar army has a singular warmth.</p><p>
    The outdoors play a role in ""Part Two"", as the sound of rainfall mixes with oscillating guitar tones. Once Kane's clicking beat enters, the piece becomes hypnotically metronomic, with two-chord guitars marching forward. Over that robotic lurch, dense sounds roll in like thunder clouds, adding a scary dissonance. The piece ends like a soundtrack to a horror-film directed by Stan Brakhage, filled with blurry shots that imply violence through abstract light and color. </p><p>
    ""Part Three"" is <em>A Crimson Grail</em>'s most direct statement, a buzzing, slow-burning drone that never wavers. It's also the closest to what one might expect from 400 guitars: a thick, solid wall of sound. But imagination alone couldn't predict the piece's undulating textures, a result of the massed intonation techniques Chatham has honed for three decades.</p><p>
    At least the audience didn't seem to expect that, judging by their sharp, reflexive applause. Chatham responds with an encore of a darker drone that seems to create howls and screams. Whether those noises came from the guitars or the delirious onlookers is hard to tell, but one thing is for sure: This wasn't just a performance, it was a larger-than-life sonic environment. And <em>A Crimson Grail</em> offers the best panoramic snapshot one could hope for.</p></div>"|9883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9883-a-crimson-grail-for-400-electric-guitars/|8.7|Marc Masters

    Pull out your old copy of <em>Norton's</em> <em>Anthology</em>.
    Here on their second album, the Memory Band-- once the
    brainchild of Stephen Cracknell of English folk-electronica outfit Gorodischj,
    now a fully collaborative unit-- draw from traditional British folk dating
    back more than a century. One song, here titled ""I Wish I Wish"",
    derives from a ballad collected by John Clare in the early 1800s (you might
    know it from Uncle Tupelo's ""I Wish My Baby Was Born"").</p><p>
    The album is not, however, the backwards-looking,
    academic exercise that such a description might imply; wisely, the band
    modernizes these influences, often in unexpected ways. There are covers of
    songs by Ronnie Lane (""The Poacher""), Rotary Connection (""Want
    You to Know""), and Carly Simon (""Why"") among these old tunes, as
    well as a sly nod to Led Zeppelin on the opener ""Blackwaterside"".
    Plus, Rhys Morgan introduces programmed beats that are so well integrated into
    the music that you barely even notice the synthetic encroaching on the organic.
    Cracknell envisions the Memory Band in the tradition of folk supergroups of the
    1960s and 70s, and he has certainly corralled an impressive line-up for <em>Apron
    Strings,</em> including Adem and members of Hot Chip and Simian.</p><p>
    As befits an album drawing from traditional ballads, <em>Apron
    Strings</em> is full of songs about good love and bad; it is neither idyllic nor
    pastoral-- an overused adjective as regards folk music-- but ambivalently
    bucolic. Featuring backing vocals from Adem, ""Come Write Me Down""
    sounds like an invocation to the muse, asking for inspiration via romance, and
    ""Want You to Know"" repeats its declaration like a mantra: ""Want
    you to know you make me happy/ Want you to know you make me smile."" That
    song, dating far back into the 1970s, sounds perfectly at home alongside
    ""Green Grows the Laurel"", as do Cracknell's own compositions like
    ""Evil"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Among these breezy odes to devotion and companionship,
    however, are darker songs in which love has curdled and hearts have hardened:
    as Nancy Wallace sings on ""Why"", ""Why does your love hurt so
    much?"" The traditional ""I Wish I Wish"" finds Wallace lamenting
    both her pregnancy and her husband's abandonment. As she wishes away her
    disgrace-- ""But a maid again I never shall be/ Until apples grows on that
    orange tree""-- Jennymay Logan's fiddle solo daydreams the narrator out of
    her sad predicament, if only for a few fleeting moments. 
    </p>
<p>
    Interspersed between gentle, occasionally lulling
    instrumentals like ""Reasons"" and ""The Light"" (featuring Hot
    Chip's Al Doyle), these love songs manage to plumb extreme emotions-- exquisite
    happiness and desperate dejection-- while presenting them as different sides to
    the same shilling. Musically, the same sounds and tones are used to express
    very different situations. The gentle guitar strums and violin bows on
    ""Come Write Me Down"" portray a hopeful anticipation, while those same
    instruments spell damning unhappiness on ""Green Grows the Laurel"". As
    a result, <em>Apron Strings</em> sounds as warm and familiar as an old quilt. The
    Memory Band may not be the supergroup Cracknell intended, but <em>Apron Strings</em>
    capably captures the joy of collaboration.

    My introduction to the Softlightes was the video for ""Heart Made of Sound"", the beaming title track of the SoCal quartet's 2006 EP. A stop-motion marvel directed by Kris Moyes, the three-minute clip spells out the song's childlike lyrics, <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em>-style, with found household objects from Post-It Notes and paper clips to bananas, kitchen utensils, and shoelaces. It cleverly complements the gentle whimsy of a piano-dappled acoustic number about, well, getting stuck in clouds and listening to trees.</p><p>
    The Softlightes' debut full-length extends that cutesy sensibility to other soft, light indie pop styles. Singer/songwriter Ron Fountenberry and bassist Kristian Dunn formed the group out of the pastel-colored ashes of previous project the Incredible Moses Leroy, which folded following 2003's somewhat more soulful <em>The Incredible Moses Leroy Become the Soft.Lightes</em>, helmed by Beck drummer Joey Waronker. On the self-produced <em>Say No to Being Cool - Say Yes to Being Happy</em>, the Softlightes at times become rather too saccharine, belying their naïve-pop formulation.</p><p>
    For all their soft-hearted subject matter, the Softlightes sound more like former labelmate Ben Lee or recent Flaming Lips than, say, the Boy Least Likely To. Their style is a pristine amalgam of sleepy acoustic guitars, restrained electronics, and Foutenberry's boyish, feathery voice. ""Girlkillsbear"" settles for recreating the Postal Service's <em>Give Up </em>with more awkward lyrics (""You're like an army, baby/ When you start to cry""), while ""The Robots in My Bedroom Were Playing Arena Rock"" is a silly detour into playful riff-rock led by nonsensical vocoder vox á la Daft Punk. More typical of the Softlightes is the shambling folk-pop of ""A Town Named Blue"".
    </p>
<p>
    The group's no-rough-edges aesthetic can't airbrush away some uneven songwriting. Yeah, ""Heart Made of Sound"" remains an evocative exercise in innocent pop, though its chorus (""They want you, but they don't believe to want you"") still leaves me scratching my head. But ""The Microwave Song"" pins its hopes on an overblown chorus based on the inane mantra, ""I am just a microwave."" Meanwhile, the childhood reminiscences of ""Leanor and Me""-- with a spare bassline that hints at Bobby Darin's ""Beyond the Sea""-- come off a bit rose-colored, as Fountenberry recalls, ""We were there when Johnny Lemon died... I didn't know his music yet."" Cute pop can be an antidote to much of recent rock's self-seriousness, but the Softlightes' neutered approach too frequently cloys. Anything else good on YouTube tonight?

    Tim Hecker's second full-length under his own name--
    originally on Mille Plateaux in 2003, then out of print, now reissued on Alien
    8-- was inspired in part by an image of a
    commercial fisherman gracefully tending to his boat's rigging. When I hear
    background like this about an instrumental album, I always try to listen at
    least once without thinking of the reference. Which is, of course, impossible,
    as surely as you're unable to keep a picture of an elephant out of your mind
    right now. But it's still worth a try, to see whether one can absorb and study
    sound <em>as</em> sound, whether music, abstract as it is, can tell a story or
    conjure an atmosphere completely on its own. It's a question with a long
    history. In the last century, there was Holst's<em> The Planets</em>, which
    attempted to render the Roman gods using music. Is ""Saturn"" in fact
    ""Saturn-like""? Could you tell without knowing the title?</p><p>
    Hard to say. But hearing <em>Radio Amor</em>'s opening
    track ""Song of the Highwire Shrimper"" I thought immediately of Herbie
    Hancock's <em>Maiden Voyage</em>, another instrumental suite inspired by the sea
    that seems to evoke its subject. When I went back later to re-read my initial
    review of <em>Radio Amor</em>, I saw that I'd previously noted the Hancock
    connection; so for me at least, there's something to the link. ""Song of
    the Highwire Shrimper"", with its brief trill of piano notes coiled
    haphazardly on a floor of static-flecked drone, sure <em>feels</em> aqueous, like
    it's pushing away from something solid, that quiet sensation of drift and
    inertia before the engines kick in or the sail goes up. It's hard to know when
    the following ""(They Call Me) Jimmy"" begins without looking at the CD
    player, but its blaring, warning-signal whine-- when it arrives-- continues the
    metaphor in dramatic fashion.</p><p>
    These opening tracks are Hecker at his most painterly
    and evocative, the closest he's come so far to the concrete imagery of Brian Eno's <em>On
    Land</em>. But the remainder of the album, through accident or design, doesn't
    sustain the aquatic vibe. The prevailing theme of <em>Radio Amor </em>sounds to
    me now like a struggle for connection. It's a conversation that hopes to be
    carried across frayed wires that are constantly shorting out, causing the
    signal to disintegrate in a cloud of static. It's not voices per se that are
    trying to get over, but essences, information. The piano notes that are being
    smashed to digital bits during ""I'm Transmitting Tonight"" seem to
    come from a song whose meaning is clear and whose melody is true, but there's
    no way for it to make it through to us. In this world, all sounds are reduced
    to their fundamentals and smeared like mud against a crumbling brick wall. But
    the shapes are still something to behold. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's a tense record. <em>Radio Amor </em>is Hecker's coldest
    and most piercing work, without the billowy blissed-out sections he usually
    manages to work in somewhere. In the mid-album stretch from ""7000
    Miles"" through ""The Star Compass"", the drones are needley and
    harsh, with pricks of static keeping the mood on edge. It's not easy to listen
    to casually. 
    </p>
<p>
    Returning here again after internalizing <em>Mirages </em>and
    <em>Harmony in Ultraviolet</em>, Hecker sounds like he hadn't quite mastered the
    use of dynamics at this point, that the arcs between whisper-soft
    and explosively loud weren't mapped out as clearly. During the record's final
    section, on tracks like ""Azure, Azure"", he begins to draw in the
    distorted, metal-derived guitar gurgles that became much more pronounced on his
    next album. But here the impact is subtler, the guitar less a towering symbol
    of destruction and more just another sound tool, one you wouldn't necessarily
    pick out if you weren't listening for it. 
    </p>
<p>
    That said, <em>Radio Amor </em>holds up very well. If
    anything, coming back to this record makes Hecker's sound seem more diverse
    than I've been giving him credit for. His records sound like the work of a
    single person with a clear aesthetic, but their range in moods and
    varying impact are markers of a more flexible approach. Time will tell.

    1986 was rap's first truly explosive year, when the still-nascent genre began to expand and the previously unheard of became possible: Run-D.M.C. went triple-platinum, the Beastie Boys became rap's first white superstars, the Juice Crew/Boogie Down Productions ""Bridge Wars"" set the early gold standard for beef,  Ice-T turned Schooly D's gangsta flair into a West Coast turning point with ""6'N the Mornin'"", and Public Enemy laid the groundwork for a new era when they signed to Def Jam.</p><p>
    That same year, the pairing of remixer Louis Flores and a limo driver and record collector in his early forties named Lenny Roberts set the rap world on its ear in an entirely different way. Street Beat catalogue number SBR-501, a six-song, 19 1/2-minute EP better known as <em>Ultimate Breaks &amp; Beats</em>, was originally supposed to be a quick go-to for less-established and/or cratedigging-averse DJs, a collection of party-rocking tracks that were tweaked and remixed to facilitate easy mixing and beat-juggling. But as the 808 and its boom-clap beats waned in the face of affordable sampler technology, the <em>Ultimate Breaks &amp; Beats</em> series-- 25 volumes in all, released between 1986-91-- quickly developed another function: a do-it-yourself production kit.</p><p>
    Coupled with that year's James Brown comp <em>In the Jungle Groove</em> (which reintroduced ""Funky Drummer"" and a ton of other Clyde Stubblefield breaks into the hip-hop production repertoire), the <em>Ultimate Breaks &amp; Beats</em> series would prove to be a roadmap for the history and evolution of the sample-era hip-hop beat, even if hardcore wax-hoarders and MPC wizards considered the series' divulging of decades-old sources to be nothing short of snitching.</p><p>
    Of course, these days sites like <strong><u><a href=""http://www.the-breaks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the-breaks.com</a></u></strong> help even the most new-school kids brush up on their DJ Premier ingredients, which means that the recent release of <em>Ultimate Breaks &amp; Beats: The Complete Collection</em> isn't the huge epiphany it could be. What it does accomplish, however, is nothing short of exhaustive (and almost certainly illegal): Two CDs with all 174 of the series' tracks as 192 kbps mp3s, plus a DVD that reproduces each song as a higher-quality .aiff file. Also thrown in is a reproduction of all the original cover art, including the Kevin Harris graf-style visuals that appeared on most volumes from No. 13 onwards. For a series that's been plagued with muddy-sounding second-hand reproductions and bootleg-of-a-bootleg white-label shadiness, everything here sounds at least as good as its source material; vinyl crackle occasionally manifests itself if you listen for it, but otherwise it richly rewards a good set of headphones.</p><p>
    As an archival reference it's priceless, but as a musical collection it's simultaneously inviting and overwhelming. It's fun to start into an unfamiliar track, waiting for that pivotal three- or four-second moment you recognize from a classic EPMD or Gang Starr cut, but so many of the songs-- Incredible Bongo Band's ""Apache"", Melvin Bliss' ""Substitution"", Jimmy Castor's ""It's Just Begun"", ESG's ""U.F.O."", the Mohawks' ""The Champ""-- have become so integral to hip-hop production lore that it's easy to take them for granted, at least until you listen to them and remember why they rocked so many parties in the first place. Other songs seem useful only as breaks; once the vocals come in on Jefferson Starship's gonad showcase ""Rock Music"" or Delegation's syrupy lounge-soul ""Oh Honey"" it's a good time to tune out. It might also irritate the casual, non-DJ listener that Flores remixed a few tracks a bit too liberally-- it's fun to hear the cowbell for another few seconds at the beginning of the Rolling Stones' ""Honky Tonk Women"", but slowing the break in the Winstons' ""Amen, My Brother"" to a drastically reduced BPM than the rest of the track is more utilitarian than entertaining. (Besides, it sounds better fast anyways, as approximately 5,000 jungle songs have proven.)</p><p>
    But take away the break-source context of this collection, and it's a scattershot but highly entertaining and often bizarre nonlinear history of funk, r&amp;b, soul jazz and, occasionally, rock (yes, Thin Lizzy's ""Johnny the Fox"" and Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way"" are here). This is a remarkably egalitarian collection, where a James Brown track everyone knows rubs elbows with long-forgotten obscurities from Magic Touch and John Davis. And some of the more interesting moments center around rare breaks that never got much further than their first <em>UB&amp;B</em> appearance. An Afrika Bambaataa-unearthed version of ""Sing a Simple Song"" by the Filipino funk band Please showed up on <em>Volume 6</em>, but it didn't catch on since the massive drum break in the Sly &amp; the Family Stone original was already so popular. Lucy Hawkins' gutsy ""Gotta Get Out of Here"" suffered not just from its overtly disco unfashionability but from the fact that it appeared on 1987's <em>Volume 11</em>, overshadowed by omnipresent breaks like the Honeydrippers' ""Impeach the President"" and the Headhunters' ""God Made Me Funky"". And while there were probably a few parties that went crazy when the DJ threw on David Matthews' ultra-weird orchestral funk-lite mutation of the theme from <em>Star Wars</em> (<em>Volume 15</em>), I still can't recall anyone who bothered taking advantage of its resonant, R2D2-inflected break on an actual record.</p><p>
    The <em>Ultimate Breaks &amp; Beats</em> series ceased around 1991-- maybe not coincidentally, the same year Biz Markie was taken to court by Gilbert O'Sullivan over an uncleared sample. In its final years, the series hinted at a few of the changes rap production would go through in the ensuing decade: The 86-88 comps are heavy on funk and r&amp;b, while those from 89-91 have a few more of the soul jazz sources (Lonnie Liston Smith, Tom Scott, Lou Donaldson) that would define much of East Coast rap at the end of the decade. In its absence, compilations like the psych and fusion-heavy <em>Dusty Fingers</em> and the RZA-centric <em>Shaolin Soul</em> did their part to fill its shoes, but it wasn't quite the same. With sampling proving to be a secondary or even inessential option to many modern producers, <em>The Complete Collection</em> serves as a double-shot of nostalgia-- both for the early-mid 70s block parties, where many of these records debuted, and the late '80s revolution that translated these breaks into rap's first golden age.

    The 12-minute ""Psalm 42"" opens this box set collecting of the work
    of the unclassifiable early 1970s project Trees Community. This psalm, chanson,
    ballad, chant, interlude, and veritable symphonic movement encapsulates the
    massive ambition of this seven-plus-piece troupe and stands as one of the
    group's greatest works. A perfect mess of musical history and geography,
    ""Psalm 42"" is indicative of the band's open-forum aesthetic, driven
    by an inclusive form of Christianity that today is missing in action. One could
    easily discuss the piece without running dry of insight-- but for the 62 other
    worthy tracks that follow. Our general understanding of modern Christian music
    is so far removed from what the Trees Community accomplished that this release
    comes as a startling revelation.</p><p>
    As explained by surviving members in 2005, the Trees Community's aesthetic
    drew inspiration from the most disparate sects of Christianity. Their
    pilgrimages in the early 70s included visits to ""Trappist, Benedictine,
    Franciscan and Paulist monastic communities, evangelical and social outreach
    groups of every denomination, [and] a Hutterite farming collective.""
    Returning in 1971 to NYC to join the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the
    Trees ""continuously learned from every group and person we met.""</p><p>
    This all-encompassing drive resulted in a plethora of experimentations that
    are solidified by tradition-- many of the tracks are revived, often
    Eastern-inspired renditions of old standards, employing instruments like
    sitars, tambouras, harmoniums, harps, oboes, and more to create niche-less,
    luscious performances. Songs like ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"", here
    a 43-second a cappella stint, rely as much on mid-20th century folk as chanson
    and polyphonic traditions of hundreds of years past. ""Bethlehem"" moves fluidly
    into ""Village Orchestra""-- a chanting, unstructured rumble with
    whispers of a bagpipe that coyly hints at the melody of ""Amazing
    Grace""-- before transitioning into thunderous organic percussion, Sanctus
    bells, and a happy, marching vocal fadeout. Soon, the easy shifting strums of
    the acoustic guitar on ""I Will Not Leave You Comfortless"" appear-- an
    effortless counterpoint to the other expertly overpopulated tracks.
    </p>
<p>
    Tim Renner, founder of label Dark Holler, has gathered four different Trees
    projects and released them on imprint Hand/Eye, bringing to light their first
    legitimate release, <em>The Christ Tree</em>, the rare cassette <em>A Portrait of
    Jesus Christ in Music</em>, a portion of a live performance, live practices,
    orphan songs, and two concert tapes from a 1973 performance at the Cistercian
    Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky, sometime residence of the late Thomas Merton.
    For a modest 30 bucks we get 80 instruments shared by a multitude of wide-eyed,
    inspired talents, educating us on the distinctions between live performance and
    practiced recording, between fleeting musical thought and revived traditional.
    </p>
<p>
    On the live cassettes, colorful renditions like ""Kyrie"" resound in
    their traditional cathedral setting, but they betray a youthful, vibrant
    freedom with female vocal parts that more readily recall Asian prayer songs than
    Christian monastic staples. The fast pace and percussive quality of the vocals
    on many of these live tracks are just one example of the way the Trees paint
    Christianity in a (now) revolutionary light: Their stylistic inclusiveness
    unequivocally implies a diplomacy of faith rather than cultural robbery. 
    </p>
<p>
    On top of that, their work is indispensable as a premonitory vision of the
    current freak-folk scene. The eerie plucks and mutterings of ""Lines
    Scribbled on an Envelope While Riding on the 104 Broadway Bus"" are a
    flourish of lighthearted avant-garde experimentation, a precursory foray into
    present-day mixed-genre renascences. Continually emphasized and beautifully
    harnessed is this group's happy state of flux: ""We were part of a living,
    breathing, unrehearsed story-- a symphony.""

    Ideally, a band should get better as it goes along,
    finds itself, and carves out a sound of its own. This is exactly what Imitation
    Electric Piano, a project helmed by Stereolab bassist Simon Johns, has done
    over the course of three releases. You could say any band led by a member of an
    institution as venerable as Stereolab had an unfair advantage as far as that's
    concerned, but Johns and his mates have impressively outdone themselves here,
    moving further out of Stereolab's orbit and pulling off the seemingly
    impossible task of getting more focused while also expanding the range of their
    sound beyond its electro-jazz core.</p><p>
    A big part of the band's overall improvement can be
    attributed to the addition of Mary Hampton on vocals and a bit of organ. She
    has a high, somewhat fragile voice, not entirely unlike that of the late,
    deeply missed Mary Hansen of Stereolab, and she gives the band an axis to
    revolve around that they haven't quite had before. She also blends well with
    Johns, especially on the largely wordless ""Come Into Force"", where
    they circle each other like dancers, mirroring the interplay of electric guitar
    and harpsichord that opens the song. It's a breakneck song all around, stuffed
    with crunching riffs and inventively employed lead guitar.</p><p>
    Rock muscle is more on display here than on previous
    releases, as Johns and Andrew Blake crank up the distortion and move the
    guitars onto an equal footing with the buzzing organ that otherwise dominates
    the music. Johns recorded most of the backing tracks, and as you might imagine,
    the bass sounds fantastic, giving the whole album a burbling, swinging low-end
    full of melodic phrases and hypnotic repetition. This, along with the swift
    drumming of Lee Adams, keeps things highly kinetic until the cover of the
    traditional ""Leave Her, Johnny"", an ominously crawling thing full of
    downright gruff organ that leaves you longing for a return to the sharp beats
    that came before it. 
    </p>
<p>
    And you do get a return, in the form of the closing
    title track, which rides a fuzz guitar riff Blue Cheer would've been proud of--
    it's a grooving counterpoint to the song's proggy stop/start sections and the
    strange, droning vocal harmonies that lead it. It also ends things on a very
    promising note, displaying a growing ambition that could put this band over the
    top. As it is, they've made a very fine record in <em>Blow it Up...</em> and established
    themselves as a great deal more than just a side project.

More rare, though, are artists that play instrumentals most of the time, but choose to speak up sporadically at random intervals. It's an effective tack: When used sparingly, the voice appears suddenly like a hitchhiker on a desolate stretch of road, disrupting your zoned-out state of reverie but providing an assuring reconnection to an outside world that was beginning to feel ever more distant.</p><p>
    It's an ethos you can trace back to Brian Eno's maiden voyage into ambient soundscaping, 1975's <em>Another Green World</em>, on which he limited his voice to five of the 14 tracks, as if to reinforce we humans' humble standing in the universe at large. A similar balance of presence and absence informs the new full-length by avant-pop duo the Berg Sans Nipple, whose unlikely demography-- comprised of one Parisian (Lori Sean Berg) and one Nebraskan (Shane Aspegren)-- hints at their pan-cultural, old world/new world instrumental alchemy. Though recorded in 2005, the Stateside release of <em>Along the Quai</em> is fortuitously timed to ingratiate an indie rock populace that's become increasingly attuned to raw, rhythmic propulsion through Animal Collective's tribal cacophony, Konono No. 1's corrosive <em>Congotronics</em>, and the recent reissue of Eno and David Byrne's <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</em>. That the Berg Sans Nipple vocalize just occasionally only enhances their album's disorienting, dislocating feel.</p><p>
    Whether they're singing or not, the Berg Sans Nipple always speak in crescendos: The songs on <em>Along the Quai</em> begin on a bedroom laptop and, over the course of five or six minutes, end up as powerful IMAX-sized drum-circle surges. But for all the elaborate and exotic instrumentation on display-- ""Moroccan assdrum,"" anyone?-- the Berg Sans Nipple never overwhelm their arrangements, instead adding new layers and textures to push the songs along a linear trajectory to their inevitable climax: Digital ticks give way to gentle Wurlitzer melodies that snoop around like a curious child, guided along by glockenspiel and kalimba plinks, before graduating to foreboding trumpet lines, steel-pan pomp, and synth-freaked finales.</p><p>
    However, on the small handful of occasions where Aspegren steps up to the mic, you immediately understand why an album like this is being released by Conor Oberst's label. Even though Aspegren's vocals are often submerged and distorted to the point of obscurity, his plaintive, forlorn tenor comes through loud and clear; rather than define itself in opposition to the album's wordless compositions, his voice simply makes the melancholic undercurrent of the instrumentals all the more explicit. If there's a fault to <em>Along the Quai</em>, it's related to the fact I haven't referenced any specific songs yet: each of the eight tracks here are designed to elicit the same emotional response, evoking the common post-rock themes of hard-won triumph and hope in the face of despair. <em>Along the Quai</em> abounds with spirited momentum and affecting melodic swells, but as closer ""Nonanate - Trois"" gears up for one last thundering, percussive finish, you start to wonder who's taking the real pounding: their drums, or you, over the head.</p></div>"|9889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9889-along-the-quai/|7.1|Stuart Berman

Judging by the songs he's picked for these two discs, the best I can figure is that Saint Etienne's Bob Stanley has a strange take on what that boom looked like: Either he's blinded by nostalgia, a hardcore stickler for absolute truth, or just more of a collector than a historian or genre partisan. Forget showing new generations that these bands were worthwhile; Stanley's set actually runs the risk of convincing old indie-pop kids that the music they spent their youths on wasn't that great. There are any number of terrific songs here, and the mastering leaves many sounding warmer and fresher than they have in years, but Stanley's version of what this stuff <em>is</em> turns out to be disappointing-- pretty, but awfully narrow.</p><p>
    The impetus for this package, of course, is the 20th anniversary of the <em>NME</em>'s C86 compilation, a giveaway cassette that wound up codifying the sound of the new indie wave. The music that found itself being called by that name-- C86, anorak, ""indie pop,"" whatever-- wasn't exactly a revolution: A lot of these bands went in for jingle-jangle 60s-styled pop songs, recorded roughly and sung in starry-eyed schoolkid voices. At times it was defiantly unsexy, and defiantly unambitious-- the sound of idealistic student slackers shambling their way through deliberately simple pop. But there was often something about that spirit that made the stuff spark and shine. At its best, it sounds suddenly <em>free</em>, and you can genuinely hear the bands' joy and excitement in plowing through it all: The punk acts tear in every direction like hyped-up puppies, the pop acts delight in being as much like wimpy librarians as they please, and amateur glee trumps high sights. (Just like the Ramones!) Better still, the scene managed to embrace not only a lot of interesting bands, but a lot of downright weird ones; one track on the original C86, Stump's ""Buffalo"", is as awesomely strange a pop song as anything I've heard.</p><p>
    The big disappointment with this recap is that it doesn't reach out to encompass much in the way of strangeness or fire, whether on the twee side or the punk one: Mostly it just coasts down the center, straight through the middling guitar-strummers who usually convince people indie wasn't that interesting. Maybe Stanley's just a stickler for accuracy, and would rather make a case for exactly what the music <em>was</em> than cherry-pick the parts that sound most interesting to today's ears. Maybe he just prefers his indie pop polished, pretty, and retro, just like his own band. Either way, a lot of the tracks here-- especially through the first disc-- feel more like a record collector's period pieces than anything really alive. It's something you're reminded of every time you hit a track that still snaps and pops: The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's giant fuzzbomb on ""Upside Down"", the Shop Assistants pounding happily through ""Safety Net"", or Big Flame's spazzy/funky post-punk on ""Why Popstars Can't Dance"". You're reminded every time you hit a strummy pop song that towers over the others: The Siddeleys' gorgeous twee on ""What Went Wrong This Time"" or the Sea Urchins' ""Pristine Christine"", already the long-running king of exactly the kind of happy 60s stuff Stanley keeps picking. And you're reminded every time you come across a band that's terrific in ways that have nothing to do with C86-- like McCarthy, whom far too few people remember.</p><p>
    Take this all on Stanley's terms, though-- as a ride through the heart of ""middling"" indie-- and you have to give him a ton of credit: A hell of a lot of these songs manage to charm, and he's collected some singles even pop geeks won't have heard. Given time and patience, you'll be able to see what it is about this music that's so appealing. It's laid back, homespun, and winsome, full of meek voices and comfy chord changes in an era where that actually came off daring; call it conservative if you want, but it's no worse an idea than listening to sweet old country songs. When the singer from the Loft asks, over melancholy Byrds-style jangle, ""Why does the rain/ Why does it always seem/ To fall on me""-- well, you realize we're <em>still</em> listening to this stuff, only now with Travis-sized budgets and a sense of importance. Part of what makes this ""indie"" is how much that sort of thing matters: These acts have an unassuming grace that keeps everything sounding hard-won and personal. So Another Sunny Day bash their noisy way through a song called ""Anorak City"", singing happy-go-lucky tra-la-la in the chorus, and that's a treat; and the Hit Parade chime through a shiny number like ""You Didn't Love Me Then"", a song that makes the Monkees sound like a death metal band, and that's a treat, too. Great stuff: Just don't take Stanley's word that the roots of UK indie pop were <em>all</em> quite so comfy and boyish.

    Never put stock in MySpace genre tags, but the page for Sweden's Studio
    says ""Experimental/Afro-beat/Pop"" and that's a decent start. It's
    vague enough for almost anything to happen, but with one specific
    reference point that pushes expectations in an interesting direction. The band consists of just two people, Dan Lissvik and Rasmus Hägg, though they do a nice
    job of sounding much bigger. Their music has been trickling out slowly since
    2001-- a 7"" here, an EP there-- but somehow none of it made its way to CD
    until last month. This record on the band's own label collects versions of work issued last
    year on two vinyl-only releases, the LP <em>West Coast </em>and the 12-inch ""No Comply"".</p><p>
    A lot happens in 70 minutes, as Studio basically functions in two modes.
    Much of the time they work in long form, winding melodic guitar lines around a
    core of clean, hypnotic rhythm. During these tracks they explore the
    trance-inducing repetition of Manuel Göttsching and gossamer
    lyricism of Durutti Column, and underpin the development with rhythms that
    allude to Can or the exotic tinge of Bill Laswell's Sacred System. Hard to
    say exactly how serious the ""Afro-beat"" mention on the MySpace page
    is, but it's not hard to hear the folding-in-on-itself quality of King Sunny
    Ade's guitar in something like the 13-minute ""Life's a Beach!"".
    There's even a hint of Nordic space disco in the reserved, easy funkiness of
    the gently modulating instrumental ""Radio Edit"".</p><p>
    These longer tracks, exemplified best by the 16-minute epic ""Out
    There"" that opened the <em>West Coast </em>album and is also included here,
    are huge fields of possibility. Beginning with a surge of synth and rubbery
    bassline, the distorted guitar in ""Out There"" alludes to the sort of
    80s cop show instrumental Trans Am tried to perfect, but then heads in
    several more compelling directions simultaneously. A half-reggae beat is at first only faintly suggested, but eight
    minutes in, Studio go all the way as the bass takes over, the tempo drops by
    half, and the percussion finds itself bouncing around in a chamber of dub. They
    hang out there for a while. 
    </p>
<p>
    What anchors these long tracks and makes them not just bearable but enjoyable
    over their full length is Studio's commitment to melody and ear for dynamics.
    ""Life's a Beach!"" is really just an
    exploration of a single idea-- intertwined descending guitar lines over a
    syncopated groove-- but it seems to reinvent itself every few bars with melodic
    tweaks and abrupt shifts in focus, as new harmonic ideas crash into the beat
    like waves. The latter metaphor is made literal in the tune's final section
    when ocean sound effects come in, the whitecaps speckled with generous handfuls
    of new age percussion glitter. 
    </p>
<p>
    When not thriving on a riff into the double-digit minutes, Studio are also a
    pop band inspired by 80s new wave, with one of the dudes singing in an aching
    tenor that recalls an earlier, rougher Bernard Sumner. The
    opening ""No Comply"", with its bouncy piano line and singsong lead,
    almost sounds like the work of a different band, except for the gorgeously
    recorded bass, which remains consistent from track to track. ""Self
    Service"" has a similarly sprightly cast and a better chorus hook.
    ""Origin (Shake You Down By the River)"" combines the two sides of the
    band in one package, repeating a simple chord progression over and over as the
    guitars work through theme and variation above a percolating polyrhythm,
    but then vocals appear throwing out mysterious couplets: ""Why not push me
    right through the window/ Broken glass would do me some good."" 
    </p>
<p>
    I don't find the vocal tracks to be quite as well executed as the long
    instrumentals, but they work in the context of the album, helping move it along
    to the next place. What surprises most about Studio's unusual mishmash of
    references is just how accessible it is and how easy to like on the first
    listen. As an album, it's long and all over the place, but somehow tight and disciplined;
    it feels like one unit working through various ideas and finding new ways for
    them to hang together. Subtle humor, both in the music and presentation, also
    helps keep the record afloat. All titles are in English but they're delivered
    with a playful twist. ""West Side"" alludes to Studio's hometown of
    Gothenburg, located on Sweden's left shore. ""Life's a Beach!"" is
    hopelessly goofy, but the music behind it is astonishing. Speaking of beaches,
    we have some pretty good ones here in the States; hopefully Studio can come
    over one of these days and check them out.

The Juggaknots-- a duo comprised of brothers Kevin and Paul Smith (aka Buddy Slim and Breezly Brewin')-- released the super-scarce vinyl-only <em>Clear Blue Skies</em> on Bobbito Garcia's micropress label Fondle 'Em in 1996, cut some collaborations with Company Flow and J-Treds as indie-rap supergroup Indelible MC's, and looked primed for a breakthrough when Breeze held it down as the focal point of Prince Paul's classic narrative concept record <em>A Prince Among Thieves</em> in 1999. But day jobs and personal lives led to a productivity decline in the early 00s, their output dwindling to a few singles and guest spots while their sole full-length lapsed out of print and vanished into the off-market world of filesharing and bootleggers. That absence necessitated a couple of measures to keep their presence felt: First, a 2003 reissue of <em>Clear Blue Skies</em>, dubbed <em>Re:Release</em> and crammed with almost a dozen unreleased tracks, and then an actual second album.</p><p>
    Funny thing is, indie rap's changed a bit since 96. Back when El-P was just an EP and the Stones Throw catalog could be counted on one hand, the Juggaknots were the epitome of unorthodox hip-hop, and Breeze's conscious but raw style and Buddy Slim's decayed-groove production were almost impenetrable to the uninitiated. <em>Use Your Confusion</em>, though, was one of the most immediate and accessible indie rap records of 2006-- partially due to the current underground scene's tendency toward the obtuse. There's few high-concept ideas on the album; cuts like ""Smile"" and ""Liar, Liar"" and ""Strip Joint"" are simple themes that rarely stray from what the title promises. But Breeze and new member (and Smith sister) Queen Herawin eke out some clever observations and relatable scenarios in the process: Breeze's quip that ""some will say 'cheese' and the picture is something lovely/ Others say 'cheese' and I'm thinkin' government subsidy""; Herawin's reprimand of an evasive player; cracks about thong-strapped dollars helping strippers pay their cable bills. There's so few $10 words that adding 'em all up couldn't buy you a copy of the CD, and this directness gives the lyrics room to breathe and flow like an astute take on everyday thought.</p><p>
    Their voices are direct, too-- Breeze's cool monotone still remains intact from the days when Guru and Grand Puba were the MCs to look up to, and Herawin's poised flow sounds a bit like Jean Grae with a bit less seethe to it. (Her solo showcase, the reminiscing ""Daddy's Little Girl"", also succeeds as the most touching track on the record). They're augmented by a few notable guests: Slick Rick is brilliantly suave on ""Vows"", Nine (of ""Whutcha Want?"" distinction) lets his rasp rough up ""Never"", and Sadat X plays the bitter vet to sharp, cantankerous perfection on the reflective ""30 Something"" (a track more pragmatic than the concurrently-leaked Jay-Z track of the same name). The funk-gone-crooked beats-- with production duties now split between Breeze and Slim-- are modern industry standard if diverse, though the title track's ""The Whole World""/""Akshon (Yeah!)"" shuffle beat's an interesting departure and the guest producers (Oh No, J-Zone, B-Money, and DJ Eli) keep things moving in unpredictable directions. When it takes a decade, just coming into existence might be enough to keep a follow-up from falling into the sophomore slump, but <em>Use Your Confusion</em> is more than just a shot at closure-- it's a strong reestablishment of a group too good to be forgotten.</p></div>"|9875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9875-use-your-confusion/|7.6|Nate Patrin

    years ago <em>before </em>the vested title of ""hipster-metal"" was birthed:
    Back in a time when indie-friendly loud-guitar rock shows
    consisted of spasmodic post-post-rockers like Rye
    Coalition and the Cherry Valence heftily hoisting Stooges/MC5 rawk to denim-wearin' kids too young to know who or
    what a Jim Dandy or a Foghat was. Because Clouds' boogie redux
    would've fit in nicely back then.</p><p>
    At their best Clouds kick up a controlled chaos of streamlined punky
    ""party grunge""-- as they themselves call it-- best exemplified by
    the surprisingly titled ""Party Grunge"", where a rolling Cobain-pumpin' <em>Bleach</em>-era riff tumbles and shimmy-shakes via train-chuggin' hambone
    beats, not dissimilar from Hot Snakes. Similarly styled tracks
    like ""Guardian's Eyes"" and ""Live It For Now"" burn it up using the
    band's frequent arsenal of note-y stoner-rock riffs but merely as a
    bridge or fancy turnaround before returning to mouth-foaming,
    methed-out swagger.</p><p>
    Some backstory: Before Clouds took their current billowy formation, guitarist-cum-mastermind Adam McGrath logged time in
    one of Boston's key influential hardcore metal outfits Cave In.
    (They're currently slumbering in an undetermined hiatus with members
    being involved in a slew of offshoots: Stephen Brodsky's Octave
    Museum, Zozobra, Doomriders, and last but not least, the Clouds.) Cave
    In helped beget the terribly rote micro genre ""metalcore."" Don't blame
    them: Ahead of the curve and sniffing staleness long before it was
    stinking up Hot Topics and Ozzfest Second Stages, Cave In flipped the
    script, trying their hand at radio-reaching At the Drive-In–esque pop
    and something akin to arty stoner rock.
    </p><p>
    Allegedly, McGrath was the key
    implementer of Cave In's stoner grooves, which perfectly explains why
    most of <em>Legendary Demo</em>'s
    songs could make any connoisseur of
    bong-rock put down their Kyuss and Alabama Thunderpussy CDs
    long enough to give a bona fide discerning listen. (Even more so
    considering the totally nimble, feedback-laced, purple haze-chasing
    Hendrix-y solos.) Most tracks are focused-- especially the under-two-minute
    barnburning numbers such as ""Party Grunge""
    -- cleverly camouflaging their adroit technical playing in an
    intentionally sloppy-sounding attack. But perfect and ""economical"" the
    album is not: Besides the utterly rockin' but fairly common ""Sweet
    Leaf""-ian allegiance (i.e. all those aforementioned weed-metal bits),
    a couple of tracks unfortunately get seriously detoured on the astral
    traveling jam-out highway. How lost? How about the nearly 20-minute, ill-fitting, ill-conceived ""Quartulli Dub"", which
    drones and dubs into backwards-guitar nowheresville, complete with a--
    shit you not-- interminable sax solo! Another stinker, the very
    Clutch-like knuckle-dragger ""Magic Hater"" just takes <em>way </em>too long to
    shake it all out. Luckily for convenience sake these two missteps fall
    at the very end. Next time guys stick to the white drugs, we like it
    best when you raucously choogle rather than needlessly noodle.

    New Brunswick indie group Eric's Trip, who broke up following the release of their 1996 Sub Pop album <em>Purple Blue</em>,
    were one of those increasingly rare acts whose work has never become
    particularly over- or underrated-- at least by those of us outside of
    Canada. The group's admirers are content just to
    remember and cherish the band as they were: a foursquare but
    reliably melodic lo-fi outfit whose songs were charged with flashes of
    noise and subtle lyricism. The group's modest legacy has been ably
    reinforced by the subsequent career of band member Julie Doiron, whose
    solo work both as Broken Girl and under her own name has been similarly
    filled with a natural intimacy and chance moments of homespun,
    offhanded beauty.</p><p>
    So it only stands to reason that <em>Woke Myself Up</em>-- much of
    which constitutes a virtual Eric's Trip reunion-- is such a low-key
    affair. Produced by Eric's Trip guitarist Rick White, the album also
    features regular appearances from former group members Chris Thompson
    and Mark Gaudet, all chugging steadily along behind Doiron's
    ever-winsome voice and guitar. As has become her trademark, the album
    is crowded with organic, vaguely melancholic tales of home and hearth,
    with each clear-eyed lyric fully possessed by whatever household drama
    is at hand. Kind-hearted and disarmingly earnest, Doiron's music
    remains as resistant to curmudgeonly critique as it is to
    over-exuberant hype.</p><p>
    Perhaps since the album is a reunion of sorts, on several songs here
    Doiron concerns herself with the uncomfortable disconnect between the
    faces of her past and those of the present. ""I don't want to be loved
    by you/ I never understood your scene,"" she sings on ""Don't Wanna Be/Liked by You"", before she softens and tempers her kiss-off by adding,
    ""I suppose I'll just let the love in."" A similar emotional dissonance
    crops up again on ""Me and My Friend"", when she notes, ""We are not
    friendly anymore... so long ago it meant much more than this."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, if the rest of her ex-Eric's Trip bandmates recognize
    something of themselves in Doiron's familiar domestic laments, they're
    not saying, as they all sound perfectly satisfied to witness these
    songs from a comfortable distance. On full-band tracks like the
    sleepless mother vignette ""I Woke Myself Up"" or the wryly romantic ""The
    Wrong Guy"", the group's restrained rock textures feel grafted
    onto solo Doiron songs after the fact. Even on the engaging ""No More"",
    the best of the album's collaborations, Doiron sounds like she's
    having difficulty writing for a band again, as the group struggles to
    fully integrate each musician's performance into the arrangements. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""When we'll pass on the street/ I won't look away if you don't look
    away,"" she talk-sings to another lost love on ""You Look So Alive"", the
    song's narrator setting careful limits on how much of the past to
    permit herself. Fittingly, she sounds most at ease on the album when she remains in the present, ruminating
    on the joys of motherhood (""Yer Kids"") or casting wishes out her
    kitchen window (""Swan Pond""). Since the dissolution of Eric's Trip, Doiron has carved herself a cozy little niche as a songwriter and a master of
    understatement, a niche that seems too comfortable for her to vacate
    for long. While these home fires can be appealing, though, at some
    point Doiron's work-- with or without her erstwhile bandmates-- could
    certainly benefit from a measure of high-spirited youth and adventure
    that goes beyond that one last fond, passing look.

Even on the website that all but invented internet-age meta-review malarkey, drawing up some seemingly tenuous personal connection between author and band is the most dangerous game after hunting man and ""Dance Dance Revolution."" But bear with me. Like many of you reading this right now, I'm roughly the same age as the guys in Black Dice (late-twenties/early-thirties) and possibly share the same background (initially spending my weekends at VFW hall hardcore shows before swimming outward through the weirder, more esoteric algae of rock and otherwise).</p><p>
    The new and excellent solo debut LP from former Dice drummer and visual artist Hisham Bharoocha, <em>Full Bloom</em>, just wants to (gently) bang on the drum all day, preferably while fiddling with some texturizing knobs and moaning pleasantly in the background. It doesn’t set out to, but it turns out to be a rather interesting summation/meditation/thesis on where 1990s hardcore flopped down in the 21st century. I don't want to make any assumptions about Bharoocha's background; for all I know, he could have enjoyed the kind of broad, early musical education I forswore for ""Robotech"" and ""You Can’t Do That On Television"", spending his summers Crayola-ing to obscure hippie folk and ""Persepolis"". But it does strike me that so many hardcore fans who started out pushing their parents' lawnmower with DRI on the walkman seem to be kicking back to pleasant, ambient, new age-y music now that their hair is thinning and their mid-sections are peeking out from underneath their ringer tees. Perhaps this is nature's way for all ""extreme"" genres, unless you just plain get off on bloodying yourself and knockin' out teeth by running into the same wall, like those black metal cats moving from making butt-ugly walls of screech and skree to playing learner's permit Reichian keyboards in the name of Wotan.</p><p>
    Perhaps, perhaps. Here's a far smarter man than you or I, Mr. Robert Christgau, writing about Black Dice's <em>Beaches and Canyon</em> in 2002: ""Two years ago, when they were licking broken cymbals and mixing in keyb groans from a reel-to-reel, I told my diary they reminded me of the Swans and were as likely to go classical…Novelty records-- rock and rollers can never get enough of them."" Now that's a tad unfair, don't you think? But his Swans reference-- once a band that made guitar-bass-drums feel like you were being Jesus-whipped while pumping your legs on a stairmaster's hardest setting, before moving onto deep-tissue found sound keyboard washes-- at least seems to bolster my not-particular-original thesis that all that is solid must eventually dissolve into disembodied swooshes and smeared and prettified guitar. A decade ago, I might have been suspicious of the fact that tracks like
    ""Moon Oar Sunrise"" get all of their juice out of just see-sawing drone smears
    and endlessly ululatin’ ""ohhhhhs"" for a good four minutes before the drummer in
    Bharoocha rolls off some crashing whitecaps for the last four. Maybe the heavy,
    moronically repetitive rat-a-tat of hardcore actually set me up in the long run
    to enjoy the subtle variations of the cycling rainforest mallets of ""Sundazed"".
    </p><p>
    If it seems like I'm avoiding discussing the actual <em>sound</em> of <em>Full Bloom</em> in any great detail, you're right; when it comes to music this ""abstract,"" in the all-screwed-down-chorus/no-verses-or-lyrics sense, I'm not sure what's gained by me pinpointing exactly when the drums crest in track one or writing ""poetic"" stuff like ""daybreak guitar dapples rippling through the mix as the drums pattern softly behind them."" (I have written things like that before, I will again, and I am not proud of it.) Here's this mood music's general mood arc: starts just-out-of-bed slow; builds circular, percussion-centric variations on a general hand-drum-sounding template over a handful of tracks with other instrumental and vocal input limited to coloration of a ""prayer chants delivered stoned from the living room floor"" variety; climaxes with a slightly more ""electronic"" and ""dance"" final track that ups both tempo and the general physical oomph. But oomph or no oomph, where I once turned to Black Dice's music (particularly the 7"" on Vermin Scum) because I actually enjoyed feeling like I was about to shake myself apart with anger, I've actually been using <em>Full Bloom</em> as a before-bedtime calmative, since I now see a constant, unending tension as a path to an ulcer instead of enlightenment.
    </p>
<p>
    Bharoocha claimed in an interview you can dig up on Google that his art matched his music in that it was ""psychedelic"" and ""pattern-based."" While I certainly won't argue the former, and there are indeed patterns lurking even in the seemingly rhythmically disconnected moments of <em>Full Bloom</em>, the overall feel of the album is murkier (like the diffracted brightness of summer smog) and less colorful than his gorgeous, day-glo visual work which, judging by the amount of kids I see ripping it off in local galleries, may turn out to be more influential than his music. And comparing a decampee's work to his old band's old stuff is tricky, as if there's necessarily got to be a direct connection, but there is a certain analogue analog here to the arms-outstretched-on-the-white-sands vibe of the best parts of <em>Beaches and Canyons</em>, even if Bharoocha's warmer palette forgoes BD's digital sea spritz. See I'm already gettin' too ""creative."" Whatever: these drumtastic, birdie-chirpin' ambient soundscapes are really good, and you should totally buy them.

In fact, much of the good music to come out of the UK capital owes a massive debt to Britain's colonial past. At its best, London is not about ""live and let live,"" but ""live and live with,"" influences from every continent soundtracking the lives of all its residents.</p><p>
    However, just as Notting Hill's annual Carnival began as a reaction to racism suffered by the first generation of Caribbean immigrants, things haven't always been so pluralistic. Honest Jon's beautifully realized <em>London Is the Place for Me</em> series provides a fascinating archive of material from the 1950s and 60s, chronicling a time when diasporic rhythms were more or less the sole preserve of the small communities responsible for bringing them to these shores.</p><p>
    Typically, this fourth installment presents a diverse selection of styles, including Caribbean calypso, kwela from Southern Africa, and West African highlife, bookended with two cha-chas by Nigerian percussionist Ginger Folorunso Johnson. Put them all together, though, and these 19 tracks do much more than form a wide-ranging post-Imperial genre sampler. Instead they offer an evocative snapshot, conjuring images of smoky shebeens and Soho jazz dens, interlaced with stories of political refugees, traveling performers, and regular folks who found their way to England in pursuit of a better life.
    </p><p>
    The kwela of Rhodesian exile Dorothy Masuka's ""Zoo Lake"" is the album's most poignant moment. Like an Astrud Gilberto bossa nova, the gentle grooves and silky vocals make for easy listening, but listen closer and there's pain and longing in every note, possibly even a yearning for a home the singer could not see.
    </p>
<p>
    More lightheartedly, calypso star Lord Kitchener, who lived in London for many years-- and whose track inspired the title of this series-- makes three appearances. His very name both underlines and playfully lampoons the crown rule of his native Trinidad, but ""Rock 'n' Roll Calypso"" points to a certain enchantment with England. Nowhere is this more apparent than on ""Piccadilly Folk"", a grainy vignette of central London's seamy side vivid enough to rival Patrick Hamilton's prose portraits of metropolitan pimps, pros, players, and pickpockets. 
    </p>
<p>
    However, as so frequently happens, Kitchener finds himself upstaged by youth. Young Tiger's ""African Dream"" draws attention to the hardships faced by those who made the journey to the city. Starting as an idyllic reverie of returning to Africa, where he is ""greeted quite happily with songs of peace and festivity,"" the singer is rudely awakened by a slum landlord hammering on the door ""with bad intent,"" coming to collect the rent. Meanwhile ""Chicken and Rice""'s humorous sketch of an eat-and-run incident in a Westbourne Grove Chinese restaurant serves as a reminder that the streets are usually not paved with gold. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, it's not all about being poor and downtrodden. There's also an intense sense of pride-- nowhere is this more
    apparent than on Young Growler's ""V For Victory"", a gloating recounting
    of the England cricket team's thrashing by Garfield Sobers' side at Manchester's fabled Old Trafford-- pluck, a refusal to be beaten, and a determination to make this strange little island home.

    Women and Children make strange music-- it's ostensibly folk
    at its heart, drawing from both 1960s Greenwich Village and Celtic traditions, but it also traverses well-trod ground
    laid by the Velvet Underground and the Beatles. It manages to do all of it within an unstable
    and unpredictable production environment that values reverb above all else and
    sometimes goes too far to affect a ramshackle, amateur feel. This is the band's
    second album and first as a duo, and it's well-sequenced to lead you smoothly
    from one facet of their sound to another, opening with what in many ways is the
    most uncharacteristic track and closing with the one that best sums everything
    up.</p><p>
    Listening to nothing but opener ""Born TP"" would be like
    reading the first chapter of a novel-- it only gives you a tiny slice of the
    story. That's one of just a few tracks with drums, for one thing, and the only on which percussion drives the song. The song also supports an insistent guitar
    figure and Kevin Lasting's deadpan tenor and is crowded with
    background noises-- muffled shouts and singing that don't really add anything
    other than clutter. The next three songs aren't a total departure, but they
    feel different, sparser, and more enigmatic. ""Your Honour"" is built on two
    acoustic guitar chords but edged with charred electric guitar, and ""Feed a
    Fire""-- the first song built around Cheryl Serwa's vocals-- begins simply, gets
    sidetracked in a crowded, rhythmic section, and ends in a beautiful medieval haze
    of female harmony that sets the stage for the rest of the album.</p><p>
    That is until ""Rolly Fingers"" (presumably a reference to the Hall of
    Fame closer, though it misspells his first name) closes the record with the
    most fully realized union of the band's tendencies, the album is mostly an
    offbeat folk record in the vein of Fresh Maggots or Comus at their most tame.
    The reverb is still huge, and the occasional schizoid tendency, such as the
    woman who calls to Lasting's vocal on the verses of ""Ugly"" still pops up, but
    it's mostly built on finger-picking, strumming, and stingingly cold piano piano
    parts.
    </p>
<p>
    There are a few astounding moments where the texture of a
    song will rip open and roughly scraped violin comes pouring out. On ""Polly
    Ann"", it's a longing Celtic phrase come to offset the McCartneyesque sweetness
    of the chorus melody, and on ""Virginia Creepers"" it goes further, spinning a
    bit of sawing on the cello into a crazed string arrangement. Serwa takes ""Sweet
    Spirit"" a cappella, her voice lonely in the reverb, but she really shines on
    ""Oranges"", a baroque, piano-driven song whose sound improves as it goes, and she adds additional vocal parts, harmonizing with
    herself in twisting counterpoint that snaps in and out of unison for a disorienting
    effect.

    It's been three years since they've made an album (barring a one-sided record from last year), and longer than that since a
    well-received record was called either ""math-rock"" or ""post-rock"" by a critic--
    even if Six Parts Seven didn't exactly fit the bill they're often
    saddled with. They had some vibraphones, and they didn't have a singer,
    but aside from that, Six Parts Seven always made a sedate and stately
    noise-- never quite as jazzy as Tortoise, not as prone to sweeping
    melodrama as Mogwai or Godspeed, and never as stark as Slint. It was all
    simmer and no explosions. While that sets them apart a bit, they're at
    greater risk of making background music that's pretty and not much
    else-- a soundtrack to homework or washing dishes.</p><p>
    But the sound of this Chicago-90s-noodle-by-way-of-Ohio band went from
    ponderous to lushly orchestrated in a small window of time, and they
    dodged expectations with a remix record featuring some big ""stars"" that was
    better than expected. Thankfully, <em>Casually Smashed to Pieces</em> refines the sound of their high-water mark, <em>Everywhere and Right Here</em>, and resists drifting into background patter for at least the album's first half.</p><p>
    The lessons learned on <em>Everywhere</em> serve the band even
    better here, and their more diverse influences are more
    apparent. John Fahey's shadow looms on ""Conversation
    Heart"", a stark, unexpected
    country-tinged opener that segues artfully into ""Stolen Moments"", a track
    with the familiar trappings of their previous albums, but deployed
    with a bit more patience. Blocky guitars, undulating bass, and
    especially muted horns all tease out a few bits of melody that lock and
    interweave. It's not just gorgeous; it shows a knack for timing and
    flow, and even surprises in its brevity as it fades quickly into
    ""Knock at My Door"". That track is a bit more meandering, but showcases that same restraint, as well as little production touches
    like the bed of vibraphone that rumbles almost inaudibly underneath the
    din of guitar and percussion.
    </p><p>
    More of those horns pop up in ""Falling Over Evening"", as well as some
    pedal steel guitar, and you almost wish Six Parts Seven would give
    their auxiliary players more of the spotlight-- as is, they're minor
    details that push average songs just a hair further. ""Awaiting
    Elemental Meltdown"" does better, a starker opening much like the
    record's intro, giving more room for the pedal steel and more contrast
    with the inevitable building and layering of guitars and the sweep of
    distortion. It's more like a tide than a crashing wave when it comes, a
    low-frequency rumble that reminds you why they have three kinds of bass
    listed in the liner notes. 
    </p>
<p>
    What follows is much more typical of the bands cited above-- ""Confusing Possibilities"" and ""Everything Wrong Is Right Again"" choose to hold back
    on the small symphony until the songs' final moments, but their
    crescendos are predictable, and the mid-tempo jangle-and-plod of the
    verses more tepid. Even as the back of the record lags, though, it's a
    solid restatement of their strengths, and a decent point of introduction for the unfamiliar.

She's also known to champion songwriterly     types like Vic Chesnutt. So it's tempting to view the Throwing     Muses and 50FootWave leader's solo career as an exercise in that same     sort of stripped-down song-centric purism, but that wouldn't be quite accurate. Hersh's lyrics might be intensely personal, but they're also vague     and elliptical; few of her words even     resolve as images, let alone scenes or moments or confessions. Her     melodies can sometimes be huge and overwhelming, but even then     they're somehow broken or tentative; she flits in and out of     choruses as it suits her, and rarely twists her songs to fit any     classical structure.</p>
<p>Really, Hersh's songs are just as reliant on     bells and whistles as those of TV on the Radio, Sonic Youth, or any     other band that thoroughly integrates its effects-pedals into its     writing process. It's just that Hersh's one big special effect is her     voice, a singular instrument maybe best described as Betty Boop on     methadone. In Hersh's voice, strength, fragility, desperation     and resolve are all inextricably wrapped up in each other, like she     somehow takes comfort in her own confusion. That voice drove both the     Throwing Muses and 50FootWave, but on her solo records, it's allowed     to take over completely, to overpower and swallow everything around     it even as it sinks deeply into her arrangements.</p>
<p>Hersh's voice remains the engine at the     heart of <i>Learn to Sing Like a Star</i>, her seventh solo album and first     for Yep Roc, but something else is missing. Hersh's previous albums     all came out on 4AD, and something of that label's tangled     goth-pop aesthetic bled onto them. She might not have been singing     about candles and lace, but the strings and acoustic guitars had a     couple of extra layers of reverb on them, and they'd build as her     voice got louder, giving some of her choruses a religious swoop that     wouldn't have been out of place on a Dead Can Dance record. Those     layered-up strings and pianos are still there on <i>Learn to Sing</i>, but they've been stripped of their woozy veneers, made     to saw and clank without any of the pillowy sustain they once had.</p>
<p>Hersh produces the record herself, and she doesn't do her     compositions any favors. At times, she plays around with processed,     crunchy rock guitars or overdramatic power-ballad crescendos. It     sounds like she's been listening to the Foo Fighters or something; I     can't imagine what she was trying to do. Even more confusingly, she's     included a couple of spare, almost minimal instrumentals, all too     short to really add or detract anything from the album.</p>
<p>Still, her voice has that edgy intimacy     it's always had, and sometimes the crashing strings even accentuate     it and build it into something huge. We can still     hear her fingers squeak on their guitar strings, and her lyrics often     still have a strangely elusive evocativeness: ""This place makes me     feel like I'm dead, haunting it."" And she's still as powerful a     presence as she ever was. But in her über-clean, compressed     production and arrangements, she's stacked the deck against herself     and prevented too many of her songs from breathing and pulsing the     way they should.</p></div>"|9876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9876-learn-to-sing-like-a-star/|6.2|Tom Breihan

    Trenton. It was around the time ""punk broke"" (again), and they spoke in
    semi-veiled terms about bands like Green Day who'd been inspired by
    their past work with the Descendents and were now enjoying
    ill-bought commercial success. Bummer, but it seemed sadder that they cared.<br/></p><p>
    Lifetime could definitely get pissy about the
    success of any number radio-ready emo acts. But 17 years after they formed, and a decade after their last
    album,  they've joined forces with their mutant offspring and signed to
    Decaydance, a label run by Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz. As it goes, lots of their original fans will probably shout ""sell out"" over <em>Maximum Rock'n'Roll</em>
    and morning coffee, but the quartet's reunion and self-titled comeback
    escapes the creepy, pathetic feel of, say, Pixies or Dinosaur Jr. Instead, it feels graceful and intelligent, the natural outcome of latent
    interests rather than an attempt to cash in on nostalgia or
    compete with the kids.</p><p>
    But nostalgia's a major Lifetime component. In that way, a comeback's an
    intriguing idea; every Lifetime collection already comes wrapped
    in memories, ably enunciated by Ari Katz in his addictive, fractured
    vocals. His words gather the force of things past, conjuring the bygone experiences we still wistfully replay in our minds: The lines beside that girl's
    eyes when she smiled, or that New Brunswick basement show when she first
    sat next to you and you each mocked yet another group of Samiam knockoffs. Katz wears his heart on his sleeve, but also the heart of his scene and community.
    </p><p>
    It doesn't matter that Katz is now married and has a kid. Like the best punk writers weaned on <em>Cometbus</em>,
    he finds duct-taped Jawbreaker-style poetry in everyday events,
    evoking youth and youth culture in transcendent ways. It's something for which the Hold Steady's Craig Finn has recently become very famous. He and
    Katz are after some of the same things, but Finn needs more sentences
    to pull it off. In fact, Katz's economy is amazing, how he paints a room  an all its inhabitants with
    two strokes. Earning emo stripes, his underground storytelling is
    also more emotionally tinged (you can picture him in those places, ecstatic and amped). 
    </p>
<p>
    Katz's writing fits perfectly with his bandmates' playing: Lifetime usually eschewed excess, and as with past efforts, the songs here still end before you
    expect them to: 11 anthems in under 25 minutes. It's less
    fragmentary and poppier than 1995's <em>Hello Bastards</em>, but more tightly arcing and less radio-friendly than <em>Jersey's Best Dancers </em>(the recording itself is super compressed, lending the album the feel of a single blast). Lyrically, Katz refuses to let things
    go; sonically,
    whenever there's 40 or so seconds remaining in a track, the band pulls
    out the catchiest stops, launching into a few of their best hooks ever. Goodbyes are redolent flight patterns. 
    </p>
<p>
    After three dozen listens, there are still no duds. The first few
    tracks, though, are certainly trying hard to dig their talons into the
    listener. Packed with bouncy shifts, the opener ""Northbound Breakdown""
    could be a continuation of ""Turnpike Gates"" from <em>Jersey's Best Dancers</em>, but is also
    redolent of the premature escape and return of Jawbreaker's ""Chesterfield King"": ""I hope you're in your car right now/ Turning this shit up so loud/
    I hope you're in the mood to turn it to my favorite station."" But a
    summer cruise can't be without its problems: You run out of gas, need help
    getting pushed up the overpass. And after an obstacle course like that, Katz's final
    entreaty feels
    well-earned.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Lifetime</em> isn't an album of sunny delight; nighttime is the predominant
    ambiance. ""Airport Monday Morning"" documents a girl's
    departure, and its
    harmonies and last-ditch chorus turn out like this: The protagonist
    watches a line-halting couple kissing at the airport. Conversely, ""Just a Quiet Night"" embraces domesticity, as does
    the one-on-one vinyl listening session ""Records at Nite"" (have fun guessing what they're spinning). 
    </p>
<p>
    There is one dig at today's emo stars: During ""All Night Long,"" wandering in the rain after a fight with his lady, Katz mentions ""punk rock millionaires with coke up their nose/ ...Writing records in designer homes."" He knows, though, that his damp,  less plush situation is pretty perfect. And the girl? ""It's really all right if we don't talk at all/ It's only one song."" This is just one moment of smart, mature meta. 
    </p>
<p>
    Katz has said that months of touring are no longer in the cards for
    the band; in fact, it's said to be a reason they broke up in '97. If
    this ends up as a one-off-- a tiny chapter-- <em>Lifetime</em>
    catches the band fairly close to its late-period luster, though coupled with the wisdom
    (and differences) of age. It feels like a recap: There are references to older songs and characters, luggage and
    leavings, doors opening and
    closing, the slow creep of adulthood, and tons of people feeling tired. <em>Lifetime</em> is less about meeting the kids at the flagpole and more about the exhaustion brought on by navigating love, boredom, shows, and sickness. The eponymous title? Feels like the signature at the end of a letter...

It's downright anachronistic, really, the way the four bands on this compilation hark back to the wellspring of the whole concept of ""indie""-- the scrappy, made-in-the-basement pop of mid-80s England, scratchy C86 bands, John Peel favorites, anoraks, ""shambling,"" and hard-to-find Postcard 7-inches. There's hardly a song here you couldn't plausibly pass off as a 1984 Rough Trade single.</p><p>
    What's surprising is how much vitality some of these recordings squeeze out of that sound, recapturing the celebratory, DIY feel of the original article. The most successful-- and best-known of the bunch-- is Swedish band Love Is All, whose three tracks here won't be of much use to anyone who's already picked up their full-length. (If only they'd found a way to include the haunting early mix of ""Felt Tip"" that was floating around the net a couple years ago.) Still, these songs remain pretty revelatory: In a world where indie rock bands feel increasingly pinched, calculating, and reserved, Love Is All burst out with this total exuberance-- exactly the kind of music smart teenagers should be tearing up their bedrooms to. It's not just that their songwriting's so fluent, or that their scratchy saxophone post-punk gives me warm flashbacks to older albums: there's something almost daring and exciting cropping back up in this music, a spirit that almost makes me hope this band will grow up to be the Smiths of the new millennium.</p><p>
    The intriguingly named caUSE co-MOTION! are the only act on the roster to hail from New York-- <em>present-day</em> New York, even, though you wouldn't know it from the sound of them. Their song ""Baby Don't Do It"" sounds so much like an early Television Personalities single that it nearly makes me suspicious: How much money did these guys have to spend on vintage recording equipment to sound <em>this</em> much like a band of under-funded schoolboys from 1982? There's certainly something charming in their free-spirited spaz-pop, and they occasionally have quite a way with hooks, effectively straddling the thin line between ""twee as fuck"" and ""punk as fuck""; I'd guess we can expect something pretty interesting from them a few releases down the line. But I'd also guess that the shambly feel of this EP will make them a difficult taste to acquire for anyone who's not already up to his ears in old Boyracer records.</p><p>
    For somewhat less scrappy sounds, there are the Long Blondes, from Sheffield, whose girl-group and Motown influences are still pretty much in line with that UK84 feel; they just wind up sounding like Dolly Mixture. The version of ""Giddy Stratospheres"" here is a lot more spare and prickly than the album mix, and still a treat-- post-punk and glamour sitting well together. But it's when they drop the 60s hints that they sound most vital: ""Autonomy Boy"" has a scratchy, disappointed pulse, and ""Darts""-- presumably conceived as a throwaway-- is like a funny Elastica b-side that never was.</p><p>
    The closing set comes from Comet Gain, the band here with the biggest connection to those indie roots: Their pedigree runs back through several line-up changes to the early-90s pop underground, and the quality of the songs here backs up that long experience. Their patron indie saints, 80s-wise, would have to be the Pastels: ""Beautiful Despair"" tears along, bleakly anthemic, with the same kind of lazy grace. ""Never Die"" does the same for a more optimistic pop sound, and the spoken text of ""Maining Mystery"" plumbs at failure and disappointment the way this band has been doing for a while now. ""The song we wrote today existed yesterday, and will always sound the same,"" it says, which might actually be the case. Digging back to indie's roots like this could just amount to a stylistic fetish, a trend revival, a sound briefly back in fashion-- but if it means resurrecting the spirit of the stuff, and results in music that feels as liberated, weighty, and exciting as the material a couple of these bands have been turning out lately, then I'm all for it.<br/></p></div>"|9888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9888-imagine-the-shapes/|7.2|Nitsuh Abebe

    The first album from French foursome Cyann &amp; Ben since the implosion of their
    former label Gooom-- the label that first introduced us to M83-- creates an unusual atmosphere: It's pensive, sad, pretty music that only lets loose reluctantly
    yet somehow remains true to the band's pastoral roots while raising the
    faders on organs, Chamberlains, and electric guitars. It's music best
    described in terms of the images it evokes-- rain on a narrow dirt road hugged
    by old-growth forest, footage of small towns in the Ardenne with the color
    drained out, or a body by a river bank, all cut by the occasional stab of
    futuristic laser light.</p><p>
    Though overriding texture is what roped me into this album in the first
    place, the subtler details are what kept me listening-- especially on the long and winding title track, which begins in a completely different place from where it ends. The song opens on a steady piano part touched by
    sliding space noises, with Cyann's vocals only half-exposed in the mix. Then, just under two minutes in, the texture shifts and a kettledrum
    brings sudden gravity to the song. In the ensuing
    passage, it falls to earth, ultimately building to a big, ominous guitar riff that carries the
    song to a forbiddingly icy conclusion.</p><p>
    The song that follows, ""In Union With..."", picks up on that
    fractured note and runs with it, steadfastly avoiding rhythm while guitar
    feedback, humming organ, and cymbals coalesce into a ramshackle backing for
    Ben's plaintive croon. Truthfully, it goes on way too long, but it's a great example of the album's balanced sequencing as it flows right into the rhythmic immediacy of ""Guilty"", the only track on the record that's actually
    too short. I could've listened to the pulsating, buzzy intro develop for at
    least another minute before the vocals cut in with questionably enunciated
    English lyrics. (Dear bands, do not be afraid to sing in your native language.) 
    </p>
<p>
    It may be due in part to their continental provenance, but there are lots of moments that make me thankful that prog-rock has come out of the
    critical shadows these last few years. The best of these comes in the second half of
    ""Let It Play"", where the band finally just flies <em>off the handle</em>,
    latching onto a flute riff that springboards to a
    freakout soaked in choir Mellotron and highlighted by guitars that sound like
    injured seagulls. 
    </p>
<p>
    If Cyann &amp; Ben could've spread the intensity of that passage around the
    album a little more, it might've been more satisfying on the whole, but there
    are songs that don't totally click. The baroque folk of  ""Recurring"", for example, just never gets off the ground, despite spending more
    than five minutes trying to launch. At its best, though, <em>Sweet Beliefs</em> possesses a sweeping beauty, placeing Cyann &amp; Ben squarely in a
    lineage that stretches back through Stereolab and Pink Floyd.

    Confused? Thought Carlos Giffoni was reliably digital, a posterboy
    laptop improviser and composer? Thought-- har har har-- he was the
    humble and generous musician he seemed around town? Me too. <em>Arrogance</em>-- ""five chapters of sound inspired by one of the most powerful and
    complex emotions of humankind""-- is not typical output. Who would've
    thought Giffoni's first release on his own imprint, No Fun Productions,
    would see him exhibiting his dark side, Prurient-style, slumming with
    analog equipment to dodge the bright harmonies he can't help but send
    tumbling off his laptop?</p><p>
    Dominick Fernow, who performs as Prurient, and Giffoni are the most visible poles and role models in New York
    noise. Both release, record and retail; both perform; Giffoni curates
    his annual epic musical summit, No Fun Fest. An unlikely pair that
    nevertheless just released a split album, <em>Heavy Rain Returns</em>,
    Fernow has carved out purist space as the analog, sex-and-death demon
    down from Providence to cleanse New York. Giffoni, more mild-mannered
    and less confrontational, made his own gentler rep with colorful,
    granular laptop assaults. Then, last year, Prurient made a
    (blasphemous) digitally inflected noise-metal masterpiece for Load.
    Giffoni made <em>Arrogance</em>: The darker, droning, depressive counterpart to his 2005 LP <em>Welcome Home</em>.</p><p>
    Constructed entirely from analog equipment, Giffoni has dropped his
    carousel-ride ADD for the pulsating, black hole suck of monochromatic
    drones. It's noise's new bid to push metal off the cliff. <em>Arrogance</em>
    reminds of nothing so much as the moment in time when Man Is the Bastard
    quit to become Bastard Noise, to do with analog electronics what they
    couldn't do with brute force. (As did the Locust; as did Gasp,
    Honeywell, Volume 11, Born Against, and Mens Recovery Project: The merge of metal and hardcore has always lapsed quickly and savagely
    into noise.)
    </p>
<p>
    There is still a lot of <em>Welcome Home</em> to be found in
    Giffoni's newest experiment. ""I Always Lie"" is as air-and-light filled
    as former standout ""Who Is Home"", using a narrow palate of iceberg bass
    and shrill windy drones to open his sound up from the center out. Opener ""No
    More Air"", however, is a crusher. Using the same choppy
    rhythm patterns that he's made his signature since 2005's ""Bushwick"",
    his head-nodder almost immediately disappears into itself, sending up
    ring-modulated harmonies even as the warm synth crush of his analog
    setup collapses like a star.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Wait for Me Dressed in One Color"" lets ""No More Air""'s tumbling
    angry buzz go dissolute and frayed. Giffoni checks through pitch
    changes until he is reduced, at the end, to a singular harmonic drone.
    Even Giffoni's darkest efforts,  <em>Arrogance</em> surely among them, rebound over and over again with patterns, rhythms, humanistic sensibility. 
    </p>
<p>
    Here, where his total gambit seems narrow-- a very thin strip of the
    spectrum compared with what he's usually using-- these strengths are
    all the more noticeable. It's the most physically immediate thing he's
    ever done, and one wonders how, and if, <em>Arrogance</em> will come off live.  May we suggest No Fun, 2007?

Most people's conception of the genre these days seems to be some conflated version of New Orleans, bebop, and fusion-- a traditionalist view catered to by most of the jazz clubs still in business. For those who see jazz as a constantly evolving organism,
    arguments can be made that the sound's spirit either survives in the
    places where avant-garde meets noise, or has been dissected and spliced
    into the DNA of hip-hop or electronic music. Even jazz's flagship
    label, Blue Note, can't really decide where the genre's current form
    lies, having placed bets equally on soft-pop like Norah Jones,
    curatorial nostalgia acts like Wynton Marsalis, and now modern-minded kids
    like the Bird and the Bee.</p><p>
    This isn't an unwilling mantle for the band; beyond their noteworthy
    label allegiance, Inara George (daughter of the late Little Feat singer and guitarist Lowell George) and Greg Kurstin are eager to claim
    themselves as the present face of jazz: They started out covering standards and have since dropped the j-word all over their
    MySpace and promo materials. The group throws back to
    mixed-doubles teams like Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto, with Kurstin
    whipping up the instrumental backdrops to buttress George's vocal
    talents. But as far as following the classic rules of jazz, the Bird
    and the Bee are loose interpreters, only nicking a vocal melody or tic
    here and there (the ""do you know the way"" from ""My Fair Lady""), and
    tossing in a scattered few horn parts and bossa nova presets.</p><p>
    For the most part, the Bird and the Bee's heart-on-sleeve reference points are more recent (but not <em>too </em>recent), like the <em>Pet Sounds </em>pastiche ""I'm a Broken Heart"" and the heisted <em>Moon Safari</em>
    retro-futurist keyboards that hold up ""La La La"". Meanwhile, shimmery acoustic
    opener ""Again &amp; Again"" is a good thesis for Kurstin's aesthetic, a
    slick electro-acoustic hybrid that's dense without
    feeling cluttered-- pop music that reads modern without threatening any
    barriers. Bits of atmosphere, however borrowed, are executed well, such
    as the wintry <em>Kid A</em> microdot percussion of ""Preparedness"", or the robot-bleep Stereolab synths that pepper the choruses of ""Fucking Boyfriend"".
    </p><p>
    George herself proves a malleable talent, riding whatever combination
    of sounds Kurstin throws her way and willingly allowing for some very
    un-jazzy vocal practices like overdubbed self-harmonizing and effects
    processing. That flexibility allows her to easily slip into certain roles, like the conflicted coquette of ""Again &amp; Again"" and the
    soft-psychedelic depressive of ""I'm a Broken Heart"", or even doing a
    bit of ""Fitter Happier""-style Speak &amp; Spell on the clockwork
    mission statement ""Birds and the Bees"". George's limitations are
    revealed only by material that calls for her feathery voice to present a harder edge; she half pulls off the Lily Allen sass of ""Fucking
    Boyfriend"", but can't quite sell the brattiness of ""I Hate Camera"" or the
    brooding ""Because"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Even these tracks aren't offensively poor, just a byproduct of the safe and sterile approach that holds <em>The Bird and the Bee</em>
    back. The record fits snugly into a certain nameless musical
    genre that can be found in martini bars and designer-label boutiques the
    world over, a mish-mash of recognizable sounds and influences that's
    enjoyable but ultimately hollow (see Brazilian Girls for another example). For all the detail and talent invested, the songs
    rarely seem to reach beyond serving as mere background music-- ambient
    decoration for commerce and cocktails, mostly lacking in the adventure
    and innovation that was once (perhaps mythically) an essential
    prerequisite of jazz. On the modern Blue Note label where Norah Jones
    is the franchise player, this lack of ambition is no great shock, but
    as an entry in the definition derby for modern jazz, its wallflower
    demeanor is disheartening.

On early albums, the band sowed the seeds     of that bleakness in songs devoid of ear-grabbing hooks or lofty     climaxes, relying instead on more oblique methods of emotional venting.     However, continuing to up the emotive ante set by 2005's surprisingly     accessible <i>Collisions</i>, the band's new album, <i>Strength in Numbers</i>, goes straight     for the jugular-- if not the heartstrings-- by wrapping more ideas     around Calla's ambient, moody backbone than ever before.</p>
<p>Although their earlier material exuded a similar despair, the     band experimented with its sound rather than begged for attention.<i> </i>But <i>Strength in Numbers</i> can't hide the heart on its sleeve, framing frontman     Aurelio Valle's tortured vocals in conspicuous verse/chorus/verse     dynamics. On ""Sanctify"", the record's opener, Valle     bares his teeth, snarling with a sense of hurt and disgust straight out     of Trent Reznor's diary-- and the band follows suit, soaring on an epic riff     that falls somewhere between ""Hell's Bells"" and ""White Wedding"". But between shoegaze-y soundscapes, Calla also experiment with ideas that lead surprising byproducts like the Nirvana-tinged ""Simone"" or the <i>Surfer Rosa</i>-styled acoustic pop of ""Bronson"".</p>
<p>In between these extremes the band finds a comfortable niche,     embellishing straightforward dirges with predictable reverb splashes     and murky vocals. Valle's Elliott Smith inclinations on <i>Collisions</i> re-emerge even stronger here-- hushed tracks like ""Sleep in Splendor""     and ""Rise"" subsist almost solely on dark acoustic chord changes and     breathy vocals. ""Stand Paralyzed"" stretches this sound, adding     hints of lazy neo-psychedelia à la the Dandy Warhols or Brian     Jonestown Massacre.</p>
<p>But while their songwriting's sharpened, the     overall mood of the album still grates after a while, and not just because     depression is inherently tiring. Much of <i>Numbers</i> feels melancholy-by-numbers, so melodies seem recycled, riffs feel tedious, and the emotional register     dampens. It could just be a case of feeling too much     with the brain and not the heart, but Calla's infinite sadness feels too premeditated to provide the raw blow to the gut it     ought to deliver.</p></div>"|9873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9873-strength-in-numbers/|7.0|Adam Moerder

    One unfortunate aspect of underground music scenes is that all the exclusivity and strict codes meant to fend off clueless outsiders can lead bands to pander to their listeners. Like electronic, noise, jazz, and indie rock artists, metal bands have a firm grasp on what their personal majority demands: They recognize that the right amount of corpse-paint, Satanic imagery, blast-beats and amplifiers can lead to instant credibility. But knowing your fanbase too well can also result in albums so blandly tweaked toward the party line that producing interesting music takes a backseat to Staying on Message. So it's no surprise that one of the biggest dents smashed
    in metal's façade over the past few years came with
    Mastodon, whose prog/arena/fantasy hybrid merged metal's
    volume, technical aptitude, and playful escapism in all the places the
    genre typically kept virginal.</p><p>
    Justin
    Broadrick's ongoing quest to spend the metal-cred capital he earned in Napalm Death and Godflesh
    like so much blood money has been both compelling and damaging to purists' psyches. The noisy yet
    stubbornly melodic shoegaze anthems he creates as Jesu mercilessly
    drag his audience to an appreciation of a densely layered, deliberately emotional
    sound. For a good time, fire up some message boards and watch partisans
    tie themselves in knots over <em>Conqueror</em>'s
    decidedly pop bent and feather-light vocals. Broadrick
    floats all over the place, but even the outraged can't help but worship
    the heft that keeps his whole production aloft.</p><p>
    Jesu's 2006 EP, <em>Silver</em>, hinted that suspiciously alternative rock and
    indie-inflected emo might be the next step in Broadrick's 25-year evolution from the single-cell grindcore he had a huge
    hand in inventing. But it's <em>Silver</em>'s Codeine- and Ride-reminiscent haze that takes center stage on <em>Conqueror</em>,
    ditching the uptempo drums and unmasked vocal for a murky, oscillating
    cloud of simple ascending melodies. 
    </p>
<p>
    You could slot Jesu in with Isis, Pelican, Ocean, and other practioners of what Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy
    once called ""the new metal baroque,"" but despite
    Broadrick's endless fascination with raw sound and tone (check out his
    interview with <em>EQ Magazine</em> for some seriously protracted gear talk),
    his songs touch down with way more melody and weight. Jesu are
    both drastically more metal <em>and</em> more indie than their compatriots. 
    </p>
<p>
    Take ""Weightless &amp; Horizontal"", <em>Conqueror</em>'s 10-minute centerpiece. Over an impressively gothic, plodding guitar punch
    Broadrick serenely sings, ""Try to lose yourself/ I'm way past trying/
    I'm way past caring/ I'm way past hoping."" His weary nihilism (a
    long-term goal of his; he once said in an interview that he wanted ""to
    make something so melancholic that it would become the ultimate
    wrist-slashing experience, up there with Joy Division and Red House
    Painters"") collides with some very wistful, distinctly  unmetal sentiments: ""You're always leaving/ You're always hoping/ Wash away
    your tears."" Here, as in many places, Jesu's guitars reach toward melodically searing places
    while unleashing the same adrenaline rush as their more inhibited
    hardcore peers. 
    </p>
<p>
    For those who'll claim Broadrick's gone soft, ""Brighteyes"" pairs heavy
    delay and an earnest vocal line with a Sabbath-worthy, cleaving
    guitar crunch, then segues back to ""Mother Earth"", which some have already
    half-ironically noted might find a home somewhere near Depeche Mode or
    My Bloody Valentine. Over a rounded, triumphantly ascending progression,
    Broadrick tries three incandescent
    falsetto-vocal harmonies that cut through his planet-dense production
    like a lighthouse beacon. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album ends with an orchestral flourish, stabbing out a
    symphonic line that sounds pulled off an underwater violin, opening out
    into bursts of pure, sustained tone. It's no coincidence that his lyrics throughout the
    album dwell on clouds, sunsets, sunrises, medicine and its dully
    narcotic effects; his music comes over the stereo like its own weather
    pattern, an experience with more layers and detail than even 10 or 20 listens can trace out.

    One might hope that others follow Broadrick's lead, but there's probably no surer way to convince him to abandon Jesu and its rush of
    pure ecstatic sound. If he could hear exactly
    what he wanted without having to make it himself, he most likely wouldn't make it at all.

    Not too long ago, I considered a move to Miami (ready, Art Brut?). As
    live music scenes go, it ain't exactly the next Stockholm, let alone
    New York. Better known for club-oriented sounds, South Florida also turns out to be the home of
    the Postmarks, whose self-titled debut may prove to be one of 2007's
    most sublime indie pop albums. (Move over, Rick Ross!)</p><p>
<em>The Postmarks</em> probably won't soundtrack many coked-up beach
    parties (duh, other than mine). Tim Yehezkely sings in a breathy inside
    voice, with echoes of the Softies' Rose Melberg, 60s pop
    singers like Françoise Hardy or Jane Birkin, and Brazilian Tropicalismo
    icon Gal Costa. Instrumentalists Christopher Moll (co-songwriter with the 24-year-old
    Yehezkely) and Jonathan Wilkins draw out arrangements that enjoy the
    urbane whiff of lounge, Burt Bacharach, Henry Mancini, and <em>Sunflower</em>-era Brian Wilson. Each track has that ""turtlenecked Euro beatnik chic"" that Pitchfork contributor Nitsuh Abebe heard in Broadcast's last record.</p><p>
    Despite Florida's relative lack of seasons, nearly all of the
    Postmarks' songs share the Lucksmiths' single-minded focus on the
    weather. Cats and dogs fall in ""Looks Like Rain"", but Yehezkely brims
    over with the thought, ""A gray sky can't dampen my spirit."" On ""Summer
    Never Seems to Last"", fuzztone guitar, theremin, and an organ out of the sadder-than-you-remembered ""God Only
    Knows"" all support the singer's pensive sky-gazing. 
    </p>
<p>
    The most elegant song from the album, the horn-accented ""Winter Spring
    Summer Fall"", swoons and rotates with the seasons as a metaphor for the
    heart; ""I'm fall, fall, falling for you,"" Yehezkely devastatingly repeats
    for more than a minute like the bookish niece of the
    Flamingos. The repetition here and on shorter, harmony-layered ""Weather the
    Weather"" (see?) would also seem to imply some familiarity with house music. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Goodbye"" makes sense as the Postmarks' first video, outshining the rest
    of the album's gorgeous sighs with a deceptively sprightly tale of a
    young woman going her own way, her ""don't leave a key
    underneath the mat for me"" sentiment coming across matter-of-factly against
    the movie-score brass. With Air's follow-up to 2004's <em>Talkie Walkie</em> still not due for a month, <em>The Postmarks</em> is the best album of its kind since Hercules' <em>In the Alleyway</em> later that year. All they need now's to rope in Pitbull for a guest verse.

    pints, not passion. A supergroup before their time, the Faces stumbled
    onto something special (with emphasis on ""stumbled"")-- ragged, defiant blues-rock that transformed
    drunk and sloppy into unlikely compliments. Maybe that explains why
    the musical tree they planted has borne equally sweet and
    rotten fruit. For every Replacements, there's a Black Crowes. For
    every Drive-By Truckers, Wilco, or Alejandro Escovedo, there's been...
    a Lenny Kravitz. And yet nothing's diminished the short-lived group's
    status as rock royalty.</p><p>
    Heck, even erstwhile rivals the Rolling Stones were fans,
    which is why they couldn't wait to snag Ronnie Wood for their own
    ranks. The same goes for the Who, who quickly turned to Kenney Jones
    to replace the irreplaceable Keith Moon. The Faces' proto-Mod psych-pop
    will always be more hip than either, but their
    prolific pace and sheer vigor established a legacy all its own.</p><p>
    The Faces formed in 1969, but had burnt out by 1975, managing just
    four studio albums. The previous single-disc anthology, <em>Good Boys... When They're Asleep</em>,<em> </em>pretty much got it right,
    but left out a few musts, while 2004's four-disc box, <em>Five Guys Walk
    Into a Bar</em>, was far from an ideal introduction, padding the group's studio
    output with BBC sessions, live tracks, singles, and other arcana. So the new 2xCD best-of, generically titled <em>The Definitive
    Rock Collection</em>, serves as a nice compromise, featuring all the familiar nuggets (""Stay With Me"", Ronnie Lane's wistful ""Debris"" and
    its cousin ""Glad and Sorry"", Wes Anderson fave ""Ooh La La""), along with a bunch
    of the good stuff the single-disc set skipped (""Maybe I'm Amazed"" and ""(I
    Know) I'm Losing You"" from Stewart's <em>Every Picture Tells a Story</em>).
    </p><p>
    The songs are muscular, though rarely as
    melodically refined as many of the band's followers have managed, and
    occasionally the group's ability to make it all sound so effortless
    makes you wish they had, you know, put a little more effort into it.
    But at the least, <em>The Definitive Rock Collection</em> reminds us there was a time
    when Stewart's rasp was a powerful thing-- the rough but malleable
    antithesis of slick rock and pop.
    </p>
<p>
    Speaking of which, it may be impossible for Faces newcomers to
    hear the group without also thinking about Stewart's attendant
    rise as a smug solo star. And it's equally impossible to think of Rod
    Stewart's attendant rise as a solo star without thinking about all the
    shitty music he's subjected the world to over the course of the past
    several decades. But back in the Faces, Rod didn't need to ask if
    ya thought he's sexy; he just knew it, and the band made music
    that perfectly matched his cock-of-the-walk confidence.

    Here we have Kraftwerk songs, covered by artists whose
    instruments of choice are handheld gaming devices, old computers, and other
    assorted lo-res electronics. I can't help but think it represents some sort of
    dream realized for Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. Kraftwerk's relationship
    to technology was always complex, pointing to a bright future
    while remaining wary of humanity's ability to make the most of its tools. But
    at their most optimistic, Kraftwerk saw technology as a powerfully democratic
    tide, and they hoped to see a day where powerful,
    portable, and ultimately useful machines would be found everywhere.</p><p>
    And here we are. It's at times striking to realize how
    closely these 8-bit artists with their Gameboys and Commodore 64s can come to
    Kraftwerk's sound when so inclined. Though Kraftwerk were committed to
    acquiring the latest technology when it became available in the 1970s and 80s,
    Moore's Law means that those machines could eventually be roughly approximated
    for very little cost.</p><p>
    The fidelity is especially noticeable on the material
    from <em>Computer World</em>,
    not surprisingly the Kraftwerk album best
    represented here. Though the fuzzy edges around each synth line give away the bit depth, Glomag's version of ""Pocket Calculator"" almost
    sounds like a 4-track demo version Kraftwerk themselves might have laid down before heading in to their Kling-Klang studio. ""The Robots"", even
    with a cut-up beat informed by drum-and-bass, recreates the tonal
    proportions
    of the <em>Man-Machine </em>source material with surprising accuracy. And the
    timbre of the snaking synth line through 8-Bit Weapon's lovely version of
    ""Spacelab"" remains true almost to a fault. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, occasional overfamiliarity isn't a complaint.
    The songs are too good, and too well suited for this environment to mount much criticism. Some of the non-vocodered vocals are annoying, but the
    reverent and respectful readings generally work well. That said, the real
    highlights come when interpreters opt for an imaginative twist. Nullsleep's
    dense, lumbering, and distorted take on ""The Model"" alludes more to
    Big Black than Kraftwerk's elegant original. And Herbert Weixelbaum gets the
    prize for originality of song selection, choosing to transform ""Tanzmusik"", a delicate
    exercise in repetition from <em>Ralf &amp; Florian.</em> The 1973 track was led by a soft,
    almost new age piano, but here, Weixelbaum transposes the acoustic keyboard's notes to a
    blocky synth that would have grated in the 70s but now scratches a peculiar
    wooly itch for everyone raised on videogames. 
    </p>
    And
    that's a huge part of the fun in this thoroughly enjoyable, if predictable,
    project. As forward thinking as Kraftwerk were, they also had an enduring
    fondness for the pleasure of nostalgia. And the music here draws from that
    well, adds a twist, and finds a way to look to the future and the past at the
    same time.</div>"|9865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9865-8-bit-operators-the-music-of-kraftwerk/|6.5|Mark Richardson

A year prior to that, the band managed to     land an import single (""Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?"") in the UK top 10.</p>
<p>So in their day, they were legit superstars-- bigger stars than the     Clash and nearly on par with them as populist standard bearers of the punk movement. In a     broader sense, they're the band most responsible for carrying the torch of     concise British guitar pop from its near-death in the early 1970s into the 1980s,     where they passed it to the Smiths and ultimately on to the legion of Britpop     and trad-rock bands that mushroomed in the 1990s. Their place in the punk     pantheon is unique, too: They were well-dressed and skilled at their     instruments, played Rickenbackers, and took most of their cues from 60s mod rock     and soul, spawning a legion of revivalists in the process. Most of     the credit these days goes to the band's primary guitarist, singer and     songwriter, Paul Weller, but drummer Rick Buckler and bassist Bruce Foxton were     at least as responsible for their sound, providing an uncommonly muscular foundation for Weller's piercing examinations of youth in a collapsed     empire.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, <i>Direction     Reaction Creation</i> is the most comprehensive Jam collection. Originally released in 1997 (and finally issued in the U.S. late last year), it contains all of     their single A- and B-sides, every cut from their six full-lengths, and every non-album     EP track they recorded; in short, all of their studio recordings. The one thing it     doesn't have is both single and album versions of the songs that appeared on     both formats (one exception is Foxton's excellent and overlooked     ""Smithers-Jones"")-- beginning with their debut, ""In the City"", the band's singles     often sounded somewhat different from the versions that wound up on the albums.     The most glaring instance is the inclusion of the long-winded 12""     version of the funk-heavy ""Precious"" to the banishment of the shorter and more     satisfying album version (there's an alternate version on disc five, as well).</p>
<p>Because it presents the songs in chronological order, the     running sequences most fans who own the albums are used to are considerably rearranged     due to the displacement of pre-album singles. The benefit of ignoring the boundaries of the albums is that     you can hear how fluid the band's evolution was over the first four discs (the     last is a collection of covers, alternates, and outtakes that falls outside the     chronology). 1977's ""In the City"" was one of the great debut singles,     showcasing Paul Weller's punchy, direct songwriting in all its glory right out     of the gate, but it's also exceedingly clear that he owed his existence as a     songwriter to Pete Townshend and Johnny Rotten in equal measure.</p>
<p>Disc 1, mostly tracks from the first     two Jam albums, shows a band still growing into itself, bouncing through its     influences and landing in fantastic songs like ""Away From the Numbers"" and     ""Non-Stop Dancing"", a joyous tribute, both lyrically and musically, to the Northern Soul dance parties of the     late 60s and early 70s. By Disc 2, which     centers primarily on the band's brilliant third album, <i>All Mod Cons</i>, they're no longer operating in the shadows of their     influences, though they're still present in the form of covers (the Kinks'     ""David Watts"", the Who's ""So Sad About Us"") and sly musical references (the     chord changes lifted from ""She Loves You"" on ""It's Too Bad"").</p>
<p><i>All Mod Cons</i> kicked off a simply amazing run of three superb albums. It, <i>Setting Sons</i>, and <i>Sound Affects</i> have all rightfully achieved classic status. <i>Setting Sons</i>, preceded by the blistering     single ""Eton Rifles"", wasn't perfect (bag that misplaced version of ""Heatwave""     in particular), but the band's songwriting and interplay were evolving to a     greater level of sophistication. ""Girl on the Phone"", with its two-part     harmonies, complex structure and long, twisting instrumental break was a clear     new step, while ""Private Hell"" simply sounds gigantic with its slashing rhythms,     harmonies and ominous bass part. <i>Sound     Affects</i> brought the band's growing eclecticism into sharp focus,     (in)famously ripping the rhythmic undercarriage of ""Taxman"" for the otherwise     original #1 single ""Start!"" and hinging on the gripping acoustic ""That's Entertainment"", which     captures the uncertainty and horror of post-industrial Britain better than     nearly any screaming punk song:</p>
<p><i> A police car and a screaming siren <br/> A pneumatic drill and ripped up concrete <br/> A baby wailing and stray dog howling <br/> The screech of brakes and lamp light blinking <br/> That's entertainment.</i></p>
<p>In the early 1980s, the band's (and in particular Weller's)     love of r&amp;b and funk came more to the fore, inaugurating a phase that,     while interesting, is also the band's least musically satisfying. Their final     album, 1982's <i>The Gift</i>, was their     first to top the UK     chart, but it was a major letdown after <i>Sound     Affects</i>. Eclectic to the point of haphazard, the album bottoms out with the     positively lame ""Planner's Dream Goes Wrong"", a limp song marred by     busy steel drums. Weller's voice by this point was a well-trained, soulful     instrument, but he didn't give himself enough to do on these songs. The band's     concurrent singles offer more to latch onto-- ""Funeral Pyre"", one of only two     Buckler/Foxton/Weller credits in the band's catalog, is a crushing, nasty     post-punk groover, and then of course there's ""Town Called Malice"", an     unstoppable and unforgettable Motown tribute with some of Weller's most     incisive lyrics about small-town life.</p>
<p>The Jam's final release, the five-song <i>Beat Surrender</i> EP, points the way to Weller's next project, the     jazz and soul-influenced Style Council, complementing its two originals with     three soul covers. The version of the Chi-Lites' ""Stoned Out of My Mind"" is     excellent, but you have to wonder what they were thinking taking on Norman     Whitfield's ""War"", a song they just couldn't do any justice. Weller disbanded     the Jam in late 1982 in part because he felt Foxton and Buckler simply weren't     the right rhythm section for what he wanted to do. In a somewhat ironic twist,     he formed Style Council with Mick Talbot, whose previous credentials included     playing with Jam imitators the Merton Parkas.</p>
<p>This brings us to <i>Hit Parade</i>, a single disc culled     from a four-disc box set of the same name. It's Yep Roc's noble but ultimately     futile attempt to provide a succinct entry point to Weller's career, from the     Jam (seven tracks) through the Style Council (six) and into his solo years     (10). Those proportions should raise some eyebrows. The Style     Council was a decidedly uneven project (downright bad in its later years) with     a messy discography, and six tracks is probably plenty for most people (""Head     Start for Happiness"" is a fairly glaring omission, though), but to weigh his     solo years so heavily over the Jam is simply delusional. ""Start!"", ""Beat     Surrender"", ""That's Entertainment"", ""Eton Rifles"", ""Down in the Tube Station at     Midnight"", ""Going Underground"", and ""Town Called Malice"" are all unquestionably     among the best Jam songs, but that's not even close to being their only     essential material.</p>
<p>Weller's     return as a solo artist was one of the first shots of the Britpop     revolution,     and even in giving a plurality of tracks to this phase of his career,     this     compilation falls short of providing a full introduction to solo     Weller. Focusing on his UK hits means, for instance, both the similar     ""Peacock Suit"" and     ""Changingman"" are here, when, for     example, the meditative r&amp;b of ""Above the Clouds"" in lieu of one     of those would have displayed more of his range.</p>
<p>Sequencing it all non-chronologically doesn't really work,     either, especially given the way the slick sophistipop of the Style Council rubs     so awkwardly against the rootsy rock of solo Weller and the Jam's most biting     tracks. Beyond that, it doesn't illustrate any kind of career arc, instead     offering a puzzle for the listener to construct. Ultimately, the single-disc boxed-set sampler form is     inherently problematic. If you've never heard any Weller-- on his own, or with the Council or Jam-- this     might come in handy, but his solo years are better compiled on <i>Modern Classics</i> (admittedly, he's     released four albums since that comp, but <i>Hit     Parade</i> only touches one of those anyway), and the best non-album intros to     the Jam and Style Council are the double disc version of the <i>Snap!</i> compilation and <i>The Singular Adventures of the Style Council</i>, respectively.</p>
<p>So what we have is two extremes: <i>Hit Parade</i> is a too-scant look at Weller's entire career and     consequently does little justice to any phase of it, while <i>Direction Reaction Creation</i> is the most complete look at the Jam     available. Clearly, a boxed set isn't the place to dive into a band, and it does     show all of their warts, from their pointless cover of Neal Hefti's ""Batman""     theme to their most underdeveloped stabs at soul revival, but true fans will     want <i>DRC</i>. In spite of the music's unerring quality, the abbreviated version of     <i>Hit Parade</i>'s usefulness as a single-disc intro to Weller's career     remains limited.</p></div>"|11898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11898-direction-reaction-creation-hit-parade/|8.3|Joe Tangari

Weller's voice by this point was a well-trained, soulful     instrument, but he didn't give himself enough to do on these songs. The band's     concurrent singles offer more to latch onto-- ""Funeral Pyre"", one of only two     Buckler/Foxton/Weller credits in the band's catalog, is a crushing, nasty     post-punk groover, and then of course there's ""Town Called Malice"", an     unstoppable and unforgettable Motown tribute with some of Weller's most     incisive lyrics about small-town life.</p>
<p>The Jam's final release, the five-song <i>Beat Surrender</i> EP, points the way to Weller's next project, the     jazz and soul-influenced Style Council, complementing its two originals with     three soul covers. The version of the Chi-Lites' ""Stoned Out of My Mind"" is     excellent, but you have to wonder what they were thinking taking on Norman     Whitfield's ""War"", a song they just couldn't do any justice. Weller disbanded     the Jam in late 1982 in part because he felt Foxton and Buckler simply weren't     the right rhythm section for what he wanted to do. In a somewhat ironic twist,     he formed Style Council with Mick Talbot, whose previous credentials included     playing with Jam imitators the Merton Parkas.</p>
<p>This brings us to <i>Hit Parade</i>, a single disc culled     from a four-disc box set of the same name. It's Yep Roc's noble but ultimately     futile attempt to provide a succinct entry point to Weller's career, from the     Jam (seven tracks) through the Style Council (six) and into his solo years     (10). Those proportions should raise some eyebrows. The Style     Council was a decidedly uneven project (downright bad in its later years) with     a messy discography, and six tracks is probably plenty for most people (""Head     Start for Happiness"" is a fairly glaring omission, though), but to weigh his     solo years so heavily over the Jam is simply delusional. ""Start!"", ""Beat     Surrender"", ""That's Entertainment"", ""Eton Rifles"", ""Down in the Tube Station at     Midnight"", ""Going Underground"", and ""Town Called Malice"" are all unquestionably     among the best Jam songs, but that's not even close to being their only     essential material.</p>
<p>Weller's     return as a solo artist was one of the first shots of the Britpop     revolution,     and even in giving a plurality of tracks to this phase of his career,     this     compilation falls short of providing a full introduction to solo     Weller. Focusing on his UK hits means, for instance, both the similar     ""Peacock Suit"" and     ""Changingman"" are here, when, for     example, the meditative r&amp;b of ""Above the Clouds"" in lieu of one     of those would have displayed more of his range.</p>
<p>Sequencing it all non-chronologically doesn't really work,     either, especially given the way the slick sophistipop of the Style Council rubs     so awkwardly against the rootsy rock of solo Weller and the Jam's most biting     tracks. Beyond that, it doesn't illustrate any kind of career arc, instead     offering a puzzle for the listener to construct. Ultimately, the single-disc boxed-set sampler form is     inherently problematic. If you've never heard any Weller-- on his own, or with the Council or Jam-- this     might come in handy, but his solo years are better compiled on <i>Modern Classics</i> (admittedly, he's     released four albums since that comp, but <i>Hit     Parade</i> only touches one of those anyway), and the best non-album intros to     the Jam and Style Council are the double disc version of the <i>Snap!</i> compilation and <i>The Singular Adventures of the Style Council</i>, respectively.</p>
<p>So what we have is two extremes: <i>Hit Parade</i> is a too-scant look at Weller's entire career and     consequently does little justice to any phase of it, while <i>Direction Reaction Creation</i> is the most complete look at the Jam     available. Clearly, a boxed set isn't the place to dive into a band, and it does     show all of their warts, from their pointless cover of Neal Hefti's ""Batman""     theme to their most underdeveloped stabs at soul revival, but true fans will     want <i>DRC</i>. In spite of the music's unerring quality, the abbreviated version of     <i>Hit Parade</i>'s usefulness as a single-disc intro to Weller's career     remains limited.</p></div>"|11898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11898-direction-reaction-creation-hit-parade/|7.5|Joe Tangari

After <em>Her </em><em>Wallpaper </em><em>Reverie</em>, the band's 1999 peak, they seemed determined to transcend their status as the Elephant 6 Scene Band, making two divergent
    stabs at self-reinvention. The problem with both of the records that followed had less to do with conception than execution: <em>The Discovery of a World Inside the
    Moone</em>'s too-similar songs were coated in thick studio sheen, while <em>Velocity</em> attempted to regain a lo-fi quality with a grain-and-flicker
    filter.</p><p>
    Much of Schneider's hiatus was devoted to fleshing out his long-running
    Marbles side project. The first cohesive result, 2005's <em>Expo</em>, was a
    slight but promising new direction for Schneider, demonstrating his
    willingness to follow Elephant 6 compatriot (and <em>Expo</em> tourmate) Kevin
    Barnes down the electro-pop pathway, but to a different end; while Barnes positioned himself as an increasingly glammed-out showman, Schneider assumed the form of the nerdy lab-rat. In a 2005
    Pitchfork artist list, Schneider claimed Gary Numan and Electric Light
    Orchestra as <em>Expo</em> touchstones, and the record's tone certainly
    supported it, but in strictly sonic terms. Schneider lifted  the synth tone of Tubeway Army's <em>Replicas</em>
    for sure, but certainly not its dystopic view of
    technology (could there be a more polar opposite to ""Me I Disconnect
    From You"" than ""Circuit""?), while the more readily apparent Jeff
    Lynne influence drew directly from ELO's late-period era of FM dominance.</p><p>
<em>
    New Magnetic Wonder</em>, the first new Apples record in almost five years,
    continues Schneider's superficial debt to ELO's late-70s prog-pop
    juggernauts <em>A New World Record</em> and <em>Out of the Blue</em>: Choruses are
    vocodered, guitars are layered to infinity, and Mellotrons abound. Schneider is the nerdling scientist to Lynne's
    leisure-suited electro-Lothario, and he funnels ELO's spacey
    romanticism accordingly. The first third of <em>Wonder</em> features two songs
    that could fit on a children's science program: Lead single ""Energy""
    is Newtonian physics for 10 year olds, and companion piece ""Same Old
    Drag"" is its other half-- a ""drag"" being not just a bummer, but also
    the resistant force to all of that energy. Both songs are a lot of fun,
    and hint toward an album of They Might Be Giants-style oddball
    jingle-pop, but soon give way to a larger project. </p><p>
    Schneider's science infatuation and retro-fetishism translates to prodigious
    amounts of studio experimentation, and <em>New Magnetic Wonder </em>certainly aims to have
    the best of both worlds. The album's title alludes to his affection for
    analog recording equipment, but his insatiable thirst for overdubs (one song was ProTooled from 96 tracks) points to the contrary: Not a single second
    of the record is left un-manipulated. Longtime Apples drummer Hilarie
    Sydney's two songs suggest that Schneider's new expansive direction
    might have its limits. Her voice-- the Apples' own Isobel
    Campbell-- is far too slight to stand alone amongst the album's excess:
    Schneider buries her ""Sunday Sounds"" vocals under layers of echo
    and shadows the chorus of ""Sunndal Song"" with vocoder that sounds more
    lecherous than majestic. She simply sounds lost in all that excess, her attempted simplicity drowned out in Schneider's
    exhaustive arrangements. </p><p>
    Like each Apples record since <em>Reverie</em>, <em>Wonder</em> reflects yet another revision of the form-- if not necessarily the style-- of Schneider's
    pre-millennial Elephant 6 work. Album midpoint ""Sun Is Out"" is a
    self-conscious glance backwards to the rural psychedelia of the group's mid-90s output, and the thick drone of ""Open Eyes"" is
    easily the most enjoyable update of that sound. Yet the most obvious
    callbacks are the ""link tracks,"" which aim for the quasi-cinematic
    coherence of Olivia Tremor Control's exquisite psych-suite <em>Dusk at
    Cubist Castle</em> (engineered and produced by Schneider), as well as
    <em>Reverie</em>. While these songs suggest Schneider's appreciation for the short-form
    work of electronic music pioneer Raymond Scott, they stop well short of
    giving <em>Wonder</em> the thematic consistency it seeks (and needs).</p><p>
    The bonus materials on the enhanced portion of <em>Wonder</em> include a video
    that details Schneider's ""Non-Pythagorean Musical Scale"", in which he
    outlines a new approach to the age-old rational tuning system.
    He admits there's still some work to be done, and only hesitantly
    incorporates his findings into the record. Although mostly tangential
    to the music itself, Schneider's research project underscores the impression
    that <em>Wonder </em>is his first attempt to let his geek flag fly, to embrace
    his inner math and physics club, and let it dictate the content of a
    record, not just the mode of its production.</p></div>"|9843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9843-new-magnetic-wonder/|6.9|Eric Harvey

    Young Widows are pretty much former Jade Tree band Breather Resist without
    the vocalist, but you can barely tell. Are they still indebted to the Jesus
    Lizard? Sure. Just listen to the queasy, seasick guitar lines in the title
    track or ""Glad He Ate Her"" (see what they did there?) to find that
    same oppressive head-bob rhythm between galloping drums and sludgy bass. But
    they've learned a whole lot of patience and found at least a couple other bands
    to rip off, making <em>Settle Down City</em> a thoughtful and more original
    record-- if a little less manic-- with far more potential than their former
    band. Don't sleep on this late-2006 album like I nearly did; the halls of
    nu-pigfuck are beset with obstacles, and it might be only these three penitent
    men who pass.</p><p>
    For one, the vocals of Evan Patterson are much calmer, recalling the flat,
    ominous delivery of early June of 44. That's exactly who they remind me of--
    albeit a nastier version-- on the opening title track, when after a few bars of
    pounding the downbeat with Neanderthal drumming and a bass tone that hits like
    a bowling ball dropped in mud, everything recedes for guitar plinking and some
    idle warnings from the singer (""Why'd you come around, the city left you/
    Should have settled down...""), just before more furious grinding.</p><p>
    The production is dry, truer to those mid-1990s grails, and rather than
    the middling distortion tone of Breather Resist, the guitars have more of a
    free-floating echo above the din, crunchy but clear. Songs like ""Small
    Talk"" are less riffing and more incidental noise, punching in and out of
    the verses with an almost dub-like abruptness and ghostly reverb. Meanwhile,
    that starkness gives room for drummer Geoff Paton to stomp like a fuming animal
    over tracks like ""Formererer"" and makes moments like the staccato
    full-band thwack at the finale of ""Bruised Knees"" that much scarier.
    </p>
<p>
    While the tempo and tone get pretty homogenous, save for some backing vocals
    on ""Mirrorfucker"", <em>Settle Down City</em> is consistently dynamic
    and surprising, from the title track's twists and turns to the many change-ups
    and fake-outs of tracks like ""Glad He Ate Her"" and ""Formererer"".
    Young Widows borrow from a narrow selection of influences, but it's forced them
    to come up with a stronger-- and uglier-- result. It may not step too far out
    of the shadow of its heroes, but it is taking a step. Either way, it's a worthy
    entry to an undermined corner of the underground.

    ""Trepidation is what you get when you're overly anxious and
    uncomfortable with your current surroundings."" That hesitant sentiment
    opens the appropriately titled ""Trepidation, Pt. 2"", and one could
    assume it reflects Ryan McPhun's wobbly, feet-finding journey through New
    Zealand after relocating from Los Angeles. Well, despite initial signals to
    the contrary, the Ruby Suns' debut record is equally cautious. McPhun's affection for post-<em>Pet Sounds</em>
    Beach Boys arrangements is clear throughout-- delicate harmonies express
    optimism and doubt in equal measures, meter changes play tag with exotic
    instrumentation-- yet the pieces, while enjoyable, never congeal into
    something greater. Instead, they simply relax in a sunny, complacent haze.</p><p>
    The equivalent of two short prologues open the record, forcing me to
    double-and-triple-check that my iTunes wasn't set to shuffle, and that I wasn't
    hearing out-of-sequence connecting tracks. ""Trees Like Kids"" is a
    pleasant bit of a cappella whimsy, and would be a fine opener on its own, but
    it segues into ""Sleep in the Garden"", which at first suggests the
    Suns' own heavenly pop hit, but wilts less than two minutes later.</p><p>
    ""Maasai Mara"" is a Gruff Rhys-style cartoon pastiche about a
    Kenyan zebra named Ulysses, delivered with the melodramatic stop/start dynamic
    of <em>Pet Sounds' </em>""Here Today"". There's a message, though:
    Ulysses is captured by an exploitative businessman, and is forced to resume his
    existence while being consistently poked with a stick. Though it marks the peak of
    the album's early trend toward cloying cuteness, the track gives way to
    a satisfying mid-record trifecta that shows how McPhun's tendency toward
    daftness can sound when properly channeled. ""Look Out SOS!"" is
    structured by the lovely, cyclical guitar figure from Buddy Holly's ""Words
    of Love"" (more specifically, George Harrison's <em>Beatles for Sale</em>
    version) and Hal Blaine-style percussion. Then, after the Sean
    O'Hagan-modeled ""Function of the Sun"", comes the
    spaced-out orchestration and dramatic tympani flourishes of ""It's Hard to
    Let You Know"". It's the record's prettiest song, and not coincidentally
    the moment when McPhun displays the affective potency of his naïveté, and not
    just its cartoonish potential.
    </p>
<p>
    Both McPhun's move from L.A. to Auckland and his first full-length record
    seem aimed toward finding a satisfying middle ground between escapism and
    familiarity. Especially in the dead of winter, New Zealand seems like the perfect
    realization of his California dreamin'-- all the sunny exoticism without the
    smoggy skies and ubiquitous careerism. ""My Ten Years on Auto-Pilot""
    certainly supports this assertion, and suggests that the most fitting analogue
    for <em>The Ruby Suns </em>might be Grandaddy's <em>Sumday</em>, where the
    unfulfilled IT drones break their USB tethers and wander awkwardly into the
    great outdoors. In this light, the last lyric of ""Pilot"" sounds like
    the nightmarish opposite of McPhun's musical fantasy: ""Hi my name is Tim/
    I work on floor 27, office 401/ The phone, tie, and business smile/ I'm happy,
    can't you tell?"" He certainly makes it clear that he's no Man in the Gray
    Flannel Suit, but <em>The Ruby Suns </em>is only one step toward a confident new persona.

    Cougar's recent performance at Tonic in New York City
    commanded a wide audience to stonerish attention, heads nodding to the
    unstructured wash of cymbals that opened the show. Drummer D.H. Skogen-- his
    arms flaying, eyes closed, and head spinning in a moment of expressive searching--
    depicted a rare moment on the band's debut album <em>Law </em>when the
    rhythmically obedient elements of laptop, guitars, drums, and bass resisted the
    precise electronic matrix and let loose. But as with the progression of the
    album, the show soon turned to harnessing layers in icy, crystalline
    symmetry.</p><p>
    Yet the audience would not desist from their dancing
    interpretations of this light, easy, but nonetheless cosmic music, which draws
    rumbling field recordings and tinny sprinklings of drums into a mix of complex
    guitar loop duets and the occasional flourish of piano. There is indeed a
    massive following of this band's underpopulated instrumental aesthetic, which
    blends the TV-commercialized career of the inventive Penguin Café Orchestra or
    the expeditionary rock of Explosions in the Sky with the subtler gyrations of
    slow, acoustic-powered pop.</p><p>
    Particularly on ""Interracial Dating"", Cougar
    crafts a bittersweet, innocent wash of trickling guitars that counter each
    other like diffident sea creatures in courtship. Trent Johnson and Dan Venne
    here lack some of the melodic adventurousness that, when paired with faster
    tempos, create some of the album's strongest work later on. But
    ""Dating"" remains powerful, as light, echoed
    drums and intricate plucking patterns hammer the abstract, private complexity
    of the song's title with a dramatized, urgent, yet impossibly metered closeout.
    </p>
<p>
    Alternately homemade and studio recorded, <em>Law</em>
    retains an intimacy that can't shed its improvisational jam quality, yet it
    often sounds stiff and computerized. What then makes the assonant depths of
    ""Lifetime Ranger""'s bass and guitar duet memorable is realizing that
    none of these standalone tapestries need be further orchestrated <em>post facto</em>.
    On the contrary, the band thrives, if shyly and with too intense a
    concentration, on the live performance.
    </p>
    As
    soundtrack to a personalized nightscape, <em>Law</em>'s close-at-ear pieces are
    peppered with percussive intros ""One"" through ""Five"". These 40-odd-second slots are far from negligible, expressing energy amidst the
    occasional humdrum, atmospheric bemusement. As the album winds on, tracks like
    ""The Mosaicist"", the unprecedented, messy rock ballad
    ""Merit"", and ""Black Dove"" seem to venture further out,
    picking up speed, adding layers and melodic development without simply throwing
    sound onto a pile. The band's rigid attentiveness pays off on the latter
    track. Here, a beautiful string arrangement and plugging bass line speaks to
    bravado that should be showcased more on subsequent releases.</div>"|9861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9861-law/|6.7|Liz Colville

The 27-year-old glitch-pop experimentalist shares his European     record label and broad-minded view of pop with Shugo Tokumaru, but the     Frenchman's recordings are more frenetic and electronic-based than     those of his Japanese peer (who has only mellowed since 2004     breakthrough <i>Night Piece</i>). On third proper full-length <i>Monolith</i>,     released in the U.S. by Portland's Audio Dregs, O.Lamm overextends     himself even further-- but more like a slinky than a bungee cord, so     hooray no bloodshed.</p>
<p>It'd probably only be video game bloodshed, anyway. <i>Monolith</i> Mario-Paints laptop breakbeats, J-pop bleeps, and, somewhere, a Gameboy     version of a Melvins riff into a delightfully seizure-inducing fantasy.     The princess <i>is</i> in this castle, starting with Lullatone's     Yoshimi Tomida on kaleidoscopic do-re-mi opener ""La Chasse Aux     Oiseaux"". The real prize, however, is ""Open Malice"", featuring Paris     trio Konki Duet's Zoe Wolf sounding beguilingly listless on a     bass-heavy track that's brainy/zany enough for a dream collab between     Cornelius and the Blow. ""Genius Boy"" casts another Konki Duet-er, Kumi     Okamoto, in a Hypercolor aural cartoon. Oh, and Momus <i>raps</i>-- spitting words like ""malarkey"" darkly on ominous cut-and-paste ""Syllabus of Errors"".</p>
<p>O.Lamm mixes in some organic sounds, too. Sampled strings and     disembodied vocal snippets drive the electro-funk plot of ""The     Macguffin"". The wife of the computer voice from ""Fitter Happier"" gives     way to trebly acoustic guitar on ""Silviphoebia"", while music-box chimes     and spaced-out synths help mask a melody that's awkardly like ""Good     King Wenceslas"". Sometimes O.Lamm follows his whims too far, as on     ""Electric Emily"", an allusion to a William Vollmann story with yipping     samples and murky percussion that irritate more than they exhilarate.</p>
<p>Since O.Lamm's whole deal is pixie stick-fueled excess-- jerky beats     moving onto the next idea without ever quite settling into an easy     groove-- his occasional <i>excess</i> excesses are pretty easily forgiveable. But I still can't help drooling     over what he'd sound like if forced to work within more conventionally     song-oriented limits, as he does here on ""Open Malice"" or on first     YouTube video ""Aerialist"", which strings together enough vocal snippets     to nearly resemble conventional verses. <i>Monolith</i> ends with a succession of voices, each asking, ""Julie, what's the matter?"" Dudes, this time I have no idea.</p></div>"|9854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9854-monolith/|7.1|Marc Hogan

    your bank balance increases, so do the chances of seeing your name
    appear in scrolling text on a TV screen during a TimeLife
    box set commercial 20 years from now. But, in America, such is the unfortunate
    fate of Dexys Midnight Runners, a band
    known on these shores for one song only: ""Come on Eileen"", a staple of pub-night and wedding-party piss-ups and so entrenched in
    the ubiquitous retro-80 muzak heard in shopping malls and coffee shops
    that, for all you know, Dexys may as well be Dead or Alive.</p><p>
    The one-hit wonder tag can't help but feel like a slap in the face to a
    band that invested so much energy into developing its ideology and
    image. Frontman Kevin Rowland and guitarist Kevin Archer
    formed Dexys in 1979 around a basic principle: That when it comes to
    keepin'-it-real purism, punk rock's got nothing on classic 1960s soul. Unlike punk, with its fashionable accoutrements and sound-bite
    rhetoric, there's no fast track to soul-music credibility (though a
    background as a Southern Baptist preacher helps), so Dexys' approach
    was to present the soul band as Scorsesean street gang, wielding brass
    instruments like they were brass knuckles. But as their rousing 1980
    debut, <em>Searching For the Young Soul Rebels</em>,
    illustrated, the most honest expression of Dexys' soul reverence was
    that Rowland never pretended to be something he was not-- i.e., black.
    Amid Dexys' boisterous brass overtures and cavalry-charge momentum,
    Rowlond's shrill, anxious, androgynous voice-- sounding like Robert
    Smith before even Robert Smith started to sound like Robert Smith--
    stood in stark relief to the gritty soul belters he idolized.</p><p>
    But as with so many would-be egalitarian collectives before them, some
    Dexys paychecks (i.e., Rowland's) proved to be more equal than
    others', prompting Archer and five other Dexys to walk out shortly
    after <em>Soul Rebels</em>'
    release. That left Rowland and lone holdover Jimmy Paterson (trombone)
    to rebuild the band anew, and transform Dexys from rag-tag motley crew
    to powerhouse soul revue. So in Dexys' lore, <em>The Projected Passion Revue</em> was no less momentous than Elvis' 1968 Comeback Special.
    </p><p>
    Named after the 1981 soft-seater concert series that introduced the eight-piece lineup to UK audiences, <em>
    The</em><em> Projected Passion Revue</em> shows <em>Soul Rebels</em>'
    sloshed, celebratory vamps giving way to a more steely discipline. In
    the liner-note band bios (reproduced from the concerts' original
    program), we see the band in boxers' hoodies and listing off
    likes/dislikes that are comical in their contrary conservatism: We
    learn that drummer Seb Shelton ""doesn't believe in narcotics,"" bassist
    Steve Wynne ""trusts policemen,"" and that Rowland both envies and
    dislikes ""happy go lucky types.""
    </p>
<p>
    True to type, Dexys come onstage swinging, with an instrumental rave-up (""Outlook"") that kicks into a version of<em> Soul Rebels</em>'
    ""Tell Me When My Light Turns Green"" that's so breathless, Rowland has
    nothing left for the chorus' high notes. Ironically, the <em>PPR </em>set--
    which predates ""Come on Eileen"" by several months-- finds Dexys already
    trying to distance themselves from another hit: Their 1980 UK
    chartopper ""Geno"" is conspicuously absent from the set list. That's not
    to suggest the band was above populist gestures: Take the centerpiece
    cover of Otis Redding's ""Respect"", which, as obvious as it may seem
    now, was not the most typical move for a post-punk band to pull off in
    1981. But as exhilarating as it is to hear <em>Soul Rebels</em>
    standards like ""There, There My Dear"" delivered with extra gusto, the
    Dexys Mk II line-up really shines on the more moody material that would
    later form the basis for 1982's <em>Too-Rye-Ay</em>: The urgent single ""Plan B"" unites
    Motown and menace like a Gang of Four Tops; while nocturnal gospel
    ballad ""Until I Believe in My Soul"" is this set's undeniable high
    point, with Micky Billingham's guiding-light organ shining a path for
    Rowland's weepy falsetto, before kicking into a double-time jazz-break
    showcase for dueling saxophonists Paul Speare and Brian Maurice.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
    The</em><em> Projected Passion Revue</em>
    provides a timely and necessary reminder of Dexys' singular punk-soul
    prowess, though it is geared more toward Dexys completists than curious
    newbies (who should still start with <em>Young Soul Rebels</em>). The
    real motivation here is to catalogue everything Dexys circa 81 recorded in
    chronological order, which means we begin with the ""Plan B""/""Soul Finger""
    single before the live concert begins at track 3; the 10-song
    performance is then appended by a somewhat redundant BBC session and
    both sides from the ""Show Me"" and ""Liars A to E"" singles. And for those
    who weren't
    around to experience the <em>PPR </em>first-hand, there's this
    lingering question: If Dexys 81 were such a formidable, life-changing
    force-- as the series of over-the-top liner-note essays reiterate-- why
    did Rowland dismantle the lineup into a fiddle-happy Celtic-folk band
    mere months later for <em>Too-Rye-Ay</em>? But then, Rowland would probably
    argue, we should've seen the end coming all along-- after all, passion
    is fleeting.

    ""Tin Pan Alley is gone,"" Bob Dylan famously once said. ""I put an end to
    it."" Good thing Mr. Zimmerman didn't copy us all on that
    self-mythologizing memo. The sophisticated rhyming and melodic
    razzmatazz of Cole Porter and his Broadway/vaudeville ilk may be gone,
    but they're not... ah, forget it. Norwegian romantic Sondre Lerche,
    more often known for sweet-voiced chamber-pop, is having his punchdrunk
    Dylan-at-Newport moment.</p><p>
    Sure, nearly every sensitive singer-songwriter eventually suffers from
    rocker envy. Blame it on the burning jibes leveled at soft-voiced
    acoustic stiffs from James Taylor to James Blunt (and even John Mayer
    wants desperately for you to know he can cover Jimi Hendrix). When Lerche
    told <em>Rolling Stone</em>
    his fourth album would have a new, ""primitive"" sound, it was pretty
    clear where the dude'd been gathering his moss-remover. Sure enough, <em>Phantom Punch</em>
    places Lerche's vibrant melodies behind a veneer of modern indie rock. This extra electric charge isn't
    enough to displace the tag Rob Mitchum first applied in 2002:
    ""EZ-indie.""</p><p>
    In the wake of 2006's unabashedly Chet Baker-inspired <em>Duper Sessions</em>,
    it's nice to hear Lerche again seeking his own muse. If only it didn't
    come out sounding so much like everybody else's. Sharp-elbowed rockers
    like ""Face the Blood"" and ""The Tape"" careen in stark
    contrast to even the liveliest <em>Two Way Monologue</em> arrangements-- but do we <em>really</em>
    need another Arctic Monkeys clone? Anyway, while distortion roams
    freely compared to previous Lerche albums, producer Tony Hoffer
    (Air, Beck, Belle and Sebastian) keeps the proceedings too polite to
    hint at any actual rock rebelliousness. Finale ""Happy Birthday Girl"" is
    the most ridiculous offender, cribbing Ride's shimmer in a plodding act
    of rote shoegaze revivalism. 
    </p>
<p>
    Good thing Lerche still packs his newfound <em>Punch</em> with
    breezy, old-fashioned melodies. On charming acoustic love song ""After All"", guitar harmonics stretch a broad sonic background over soft, galloping drums. Reportedly written
    for Lerche's now-wife, ""She's Fantastic"" is a giddy ""Sorry, ladies,"" while the title track works a fuzzy
    ""Drive My Car"" guitar riff and disco hi-hats into waltz time. 
    </p>
<p>
    It can be petty to criticize the lyrics of someone composing in a
    non-native language, and indeed Lerche has made modest progress here.
    When he admits, ""I have done so many incomprehensible things,"" on
    catchy but slick likely single ""Say It All"", he sounds way too nice to
    be speaking the truth. And that's probably the point: He's describing
    the everyday incomprehensibility of fuckups we make by just being
    human. ""Well, Well, Well"" makes a rock'n'roll virtue of such
    simplicity: ""When I see you baby/ It's well, well, well."" Then again,
    Lerche can't resist a few clunkers. ""I can conjugate myself,"" he
    insists in the falsetto-laden chorus of ""John, Let Me Go"". 
    </p>
<p>
    As Lerche persists in his search for a distinctive style, at least he
    needn't also go looking for a voice. As a singer, he's a bit less
    delicate here than on more youthful, Nick Drake-tinged outings, but
    Lerche's jazzy melodic zest remains inimitably central to his appeal.
    What his songs must lack is a face-- whether the hammy grin of Tin Pan
    Alley or a young Dylan's brilliant, inscrutable sneer. While Lerche
    remains a promising young songwriter, <em>Phantom Punch</em> doesn't quite fulfill that promise.

    an impressive résumé: mastermind behind the Flying Luttenbachers, key member
    of Lake of Dracula, XRBRX, and To Live and Shave in L.A. 2, renowned
    post-punk scholar. So it's easy to forget that his roots lie in
    improvised jazz. He started curating free-jazz shows before he was 20,
    and early versions of the Luttenbachers included jazz legend Hal
    Russell and current superstar Ken Vandermark. Walter hasn't played much
    straight-up free-jazz recently; his main concern, the Luttenbachers,
    has grown into a punk/prog/metal behemoth playing complex songs about
    mythical robots and futuristic chaos. But he still has searing jazz
    chops, as this debut from his eponymous quartet handily proves.</p><p>
    There's nothing very complicated on <em>Revolt Music</em>, just
    full-speed jazz with energy and muscle. Each track hits the
    ground running and rarely slows down, charging through furious horn
    runs, frantic bass sprints, and Walter's ever-busy drum rushes. Early
    Luttenbachers sessions garnered a ""punk-jazz"" tag, but this Quartet is
    more classical, relying on time-tested free-jazz tools to relay its
    hectic message. Still, the spirit of punk courses through the group's
    relentlessly direct attack (and humorously simple song titles, all of
    which use the word ""revolt"" and not much else).</p><p>
    The core of the Quartet is Walter and bassists Damon Smith and Randy
    Hunt. Together they create a manic rhythmic canvas on which alternating
    horn players paint colorful sounds. The most frequent fourth wheel is
    tenor saxophonist Josh Allen. On four tracks, his tireless growls weave
    deftly through the surrounding maelstrom. Particularly stirring is his
    mix of clipped melodies and heavy whines on ""Revolt and Revolt Again"",
    as he meshes with Hunt and Allen's strident bowing like sparks shooting
    from a fire.</p><p>
    Throughout the album, the Quartet's knack for filling the sonic space
    without sounding oppressive or claustrophobic is striking. Each element
    carves its own notch in the mix, bending and turning to fit with the
    others. When alto saxophonists John Gruntfest and Aram Shelton replace
    Allen, they turn similar tricks, wedging their horns inside the basses
    and drums like snug puzzle pieces.</p><p>
    As exhilarating as that mix is, <em>Revolt Music</em> works best
    when it breaks the drum/bass/sax mold. On the bluntly-titled ""Drum
    Solo"", Walter unfurls a bottomless bag of percussive tricks, melting
    rapid-fire beats into pounding, stop-start rhythms. Later, on ""The Need
    to Revolt"", Walter, Smith, and Allen are joined by guitar legend Henry
    Kaiser for a giddy stretch of hyperactivity. Kaiser begins with
    Theremin-like whirring, generates heavy chords in response to Allen's
    gutsy growls, and finally meshes Beefheart-like angles into Walter's
    slapping syncopations. The track highlights Walter's ability to mash
    genres until they blur, but <em>Revolt Music</em> is no fusion exercise. It's strictly a free-jazz album, and one of the highest order.</p></div>"|9857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9857-revolt-music/|7.6|Marc Masters

    Think
    ""bat"" as in both the flirty verb and the gothy noun. <em>Fur &amp;
    Gold</em> is often a dark and atmospheric record, but it remains playful and
    self-aware enough to pull back every time it inches towards self-parody.
    Largely structured around the vocals of the Pakistani-born Brit Natasha Khan, <em>Fur
    &amp; Gold </em>shows a band quite good at giving their songs room to breathe
    and evolve, allowing the songs to expand out before snapping back into focus on
    Khan's expressive voice.</p><p>
    Opener
    ""Horse and I"" skirts Renaissance Faire silliness, but proves
    musically intriguing enough to push past any hokey aesthetic choices.
    Yes, Khan
    can come off as a bit dramatic, but her best songs fit the part.
    ""Trophy"" is perhaps the album's finest track, plodding along
    elegantly like a darker and slicker Lavender Diamond. ""Tahiti"" is the
    sonic standout, but suffers from some jarringly awkward phrasing in its
    chorus.
    ""Sad Eyes"" never quite fulfills the emotional potential generated by
    Khan's voice and some sparse piano chords, and it also illustrates a
    wider point: Uncomplicated and vaguely mystical lyrics generally make
    sense here, but
    Khan occasionally sings like she's not really sure what she's saying.
    An
    unexpected ""Come and spend the night"" halfway through ""Sad
    Eyes"" might as well be ""I'd like a burrito.""</p><p>
    Many
    of the album's biggest disappointments come simply because the band's potential
    is so palpable, especially during more restrained and focused moments. But as
    strong as <em>Fur &amp; Gold</em>'s individual tracks can be, the record as a
    whole is frustratingly dilute. While Khan has a real talent for edging towards
    emotional extremes, she seems to get lost in atmosphere. And ultimately, <em>Fur
    &amp; Gold</em> sounds a little bit too comfortable for its own good. Khan is a
    great singer, and her band is undoubtedly competent and capable, but the record
    sounds like it wants to be more than it is. Khan stops just short of the
    boldness that can make this kind of record great-- imagine Björk wearing a fur
    coat rather than a dead swan or Siouxsie Sioux wearing a peasant dress rather
    than a Nazi uniform. Bat For Lashes dip their feet in some difficult waters,
    but often seem too preoccupied with their reflection to jump in.

    Given Yoko Ono's reputation as an artist, a first glance at the tracklist of <em>Yes, I’m a Witch</em>
    can seem almost comical. Not that I want to try it, but I'm guessing
    that if you cornered indie kids (or music critics) on their lunch
    breaks and asked which bands might profitably be given Ono vocal tracks
    to build whole new songs around, it would not occur to many to suggest
    the Sleepy Jackson. Cat Power and Le Tigre might seem like good ideas,
    given a little prompting; the Polyphonic Spree, not so much. And yet
    not only do most of these acts turn in interesting work-- the quaver in
    Ono's voice will rub up against <em>anyone</em>'s production in fascinating ways-- but they're strikingly appropriate: It's Ono’s reputation that has the issues.</p><p>
    The presumable aim of this collection, after all, is to make Ono's case
    as a vocalist, songwriter, and thinker to more potential fans. And the
    truth is that Ono's <em>already</em>
    appreciated-- maybe even pigeonholed-- as a ""difficult"" musician: icy
    shrieker, primal screamer, conceptual artist, and the source of the
    6xCD <em>Onobox</em>, which I have actually witnessed strike more fear in people's hearts than the 50-disc <em>Merzbox</em>.
    Cloud the air further with the disgusting level of mockery and abuse
    she gets for the sin of having been so cool that even John Lennon was
    bowled over, and it's easy to forget how much of her work was only
    incidentally challenging, how much of it was in every sense conceived
    as popular music. It's not just in the relatively straightforward form
    of most of her songs-- whether it's ballads, blues, disco, or new wave,
    the instrumental backings are usually more in danger of sounding <em>too </em>conventional--
    but in the sentiment, too, and the audience it imagines. Between Ono's
    thinking and Lennon's global reach, both found themselves in a position
    to address ideas-- even challenging and intensely personal ones-- at a
    listener they could nearly conceive of as the whole known universe.</p><p>
    Which means most of the content of Ono's music is carried by that
    singular voice, the one thing that gets carried over onto this
    collection-- that fragile, difficult vibrato that says ""Yes, I'm a
    witch"" and ""My dear sisters, we must learn to fight"" and ""I can talk
    hip when I'm dying inside"" and ""Even with your warmth and closeness/
    The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a curse.""
    </p>
<p>
    Truth is, there's not much the interpreters here could do to meddle
    with the effect of that voice and those words, apart from wrap it in
    more contemporary packages-- at worst, the work they do just distracts
    from the clarity of the originals. Still, so many do really pleasant
    things: Shitake Monkey translating the groovy Central Park stroll of
    ""O'Oh"" into its perfect down-tempo house equivalent, Spiritualized's
    Jason Pierce throwing out the frigid disco of ""Walking on Thin Ice"" and
    turning it into a guitar-strangling feedback epic, or Porcupine Tree
    and Cat Power both keeping it spare and modest, hanging back and
    letting ballads speak for themselves. The Ono/Cat Power pairing is the
    most revelatory connection here, especially when Chan Marshall slides politely up and sings along. No
    one goofs up, really; not even Peaches. The biggest surprise is that Le
    Tigre could take a cheerleadery sock-hop song called ""Sisters O
    Sisters"" and somehow suck the life out of it-- which is what tends to
    happen here, interestingly enough, when people are trying <em>too</em> hard to be abstract and unconventional.
    </p>
<p>
    And that's the odd thing about this collection: If it provides people with a bridge into appreciating Ono's work, it won't be by making it more accessible. Plenty of the original songs are more conventionally listenable than their reinventions-- the perky Talking Heads-style new wave of ""Kiss Kiss Kiss"", for instance, is probably more immediate than the Neptunes-sounding electro mix Peaches turns in, leading off an first third that feels almost like a <em>Piracy Funds Terrorism</em> blend of Ono + everything. Which means something very nice for anyone who eases into appreciating that voice through this collection: Digging into the Ono catalog will be an easy joy, not difficult at all, far more warm and inviting than the world's mean-spirited caricatures of her would suggest.

    In small towns like the one I was raised in, you felt bad for anyone who stayed past
    their graduation date. Even worse were those who'd leave only to return, signaling to everyone that yet another bigger city had stomped their ass.
    Maybe that's why so many people I know never left to begin with:
    It was just better than having to come back.</p><p>
    Benjy Ferree was one of those who surrendered. And if ""small"" isn't exactly the foremost adjective used to describe his hometown of Washington, D.C., Ferree's attempted jump to Hollywood in pursuit of an acting career fits the bill: When his cinematic ambitions ran dry, he bailed on the West Coast and returned to a bartending job in the District.</p><p>
    Appropriately titled <em>Leaving the Nest</em>, his Domino Records debut has that same feeling of premature abandonment. Three
    months after the album's release, Ferree's MySpace page continued to state it was ""coming soon."" And his homepage <em>still</em> hasn't been updated, listing his album as available on Box Theory Records, the label that first released it. In fact, Ferree's bio insists he wouldn't have released it at all unless his friends hadn't persuaded him to
    commit his songs to tape. 
    </p>
<p>
    To some extent, the record reflects the ambivalent circumstances in which
    it seems to have been written. But Ferree's songwriting also retains a natural optimism which makes his songs uplifting even when he sings about defeat. ""In the Countryside"" kicks off with a ""Reelin' in the Years"" lick and
    boogie-rock stomp casual enough to conjure images of Ferree recording in denim overalls in some friend's basement (which might make him
    a dead ringer for Will Oldham, minus the acting career). It's also
    wholesome and completely
    guileless, especially considering that ""musician"" doesn't appear to have been high on Ferree's list of occupational preferences. 
    </p>
<p>
    But as the album plays out, it gradually shakes off some of the bright-eyed idealism of earlier tracks. Some particularly dark moments spring up on the violin-backed ""Private Honeymoon"", in which Ferree, perhaps recognizing that musical performance involves nearly as much persuasive delivery as acting itself, doubts his abilities in lines like, ""I get to write
    the fairy tales that never come true."" And on the muscular ""Dogkillers!"", he more questions, more directly, why
    he can't just be left alone.  <br/>
</p>
<div align=""left"">
    While it's striking that Ferree has somewhat haphazardly stumbled onto a debut with such fully formed
    songs, its tracks largely work from the same limited
    palette, presenting listeners with an experience that's, perhaps literally, a bit close to home: After multiple plays, <em>Leaving the Nest</em> begins to summon the same sense of dogged familiarity that makes sticking around your hometown both comfortable and suffocating.

    Surfaces are never harder or more unforgiving than in January and February.
    Cold pushes up against you; your clothes become defensive. So do you: ducked
    down, trapped in your own head. I've wondered over the past weeks if Audionom's
    <em>Retrospektiv</em> feels as it does because of how much it resembles natural
    elements boring in and reflecting blankly back. I'm wondering, and yet I don't
    want to know; records should never be able to tell us that much about
    ourselves.</p><p>
    Kemado, Audionom's label, revels in a kind of hard originlessness. With two
    releases last year (The Sword's <em>Age of Winters</em> and the <em>Invaders</em>
    compilation) Kemado made themselves synonymous with hipster-metal, a genre
    basically defined by the bands' lack of connection with the scene to which
    their music alludes. Their gallery-rock outfit Lansing-Dreiden make deadpan,
    nonspecifically evocative songs which they then hand off to anonymous musicians
    to perform. They import Swedes, drag Brooklyn artists out of the woodwork.</p><p>
    Audionom, a Swedish art collective that includes filmmaker Martin Malm as a
    member, is the label's iciest output yet; the band's New Neu! Order cuts
    diamond hard. Like a less rhythmically inhibited Joy Division, Audionom's
    preferred motion is pure android march, all choppily deliberate guitar and
    obviously synthetic synthesizer yowl. They'd be Refused if they enjoyed themselves
    more, and necrotic if they enjoyed themselves less. Their rallying cries--
    ""Kristall""'s robotic ""Tonight, tonight, we come to your
    town,"" intoned again and again-- sound like threats.
    </p>
<p>
    The Joy Div stuff is so bloodless as to be vampiric: ""And You Said I
    Was The Only One"" is Curtis and Sumner without the epilepsy and the depth
    of bad feeling; ""Kein Bock"" could be ""New Dawn Fades"" with
    all of the cavernous space filled in. It's an uneasy revival-- their
    resurrections only feel more lifeless. Audionom is a haunted band in these
    spots, and less interesting for it. Better that they haunt, which they
    otherwise do, making music reflective enough to see yourself in.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Ljusets Krigare"" uses simple counterpoints and layers them to the
    point of madness, guitars ripping in and out at all levels of the mix, the pace
    picking up to stab and falling back to mutter and bleed. More<em> </em>uneasy is
    ""Spindlar"", which buzzes grating synth jabs and intermittent,
    junked-out guitar jangles that drop out without warning to leave spiky keyboards
    gnawing at your ear.
    </p>
<p>
    Malm, the film artist who performs with them, is a telling presence.
    Audionom makes sound that arrests when it's on and is almost impossible
    to
    recall when it's not. Like any other abstract painting or image, the
    elements
    are rigorously composed, but only in regard to one another. The band,
    like many of us, is locked in its own space, across a distance that can
    seem impossible to cross. That's the rub though: four musicians'
    collective subjectivity, reaching you in yours.

    The low, muffled, guitar-and-vocals of ""Hope"", the first full song on
    Rafter Roberts' latest, make it seem as if we're about to hear private
    sentiments writ large. It is not long, however, before Rafter is helped
    by some dozen instrumentalists as, along the course of 18 fleeting
    tracks, he eschews lo-fi folk and gnashes to the beat of his own
    alternately cacophonous and breathtaking drum. Echoing the frenetic,
    haphazard experiments of his long, mostly underground career, Rafter
    here flits between moods, genres, and textures, discarding any specific
    one when it threatens to shackle his expressive freedom.</p><p>
    Whether this is always successful is another matter. Weaving deftly
    through cross-cultural influences, Rafter blends the shyest elements of
    folk and the rowdiest of rock with an abrasive, almost ornery
    impatience and a whisper of self-indulgence. There is, it should be
    mentioned, a political tenet running through the grandness: The
    glittering scraps of substance and rock-solid expression, most notably
    on the ominous synth-patterned ""Gentle Men"" and the soldierly, gritty
    strut and creeping brass section of ""Unassailable"" harness their
    romantic politik about men ruining the world with considerable candor.</p><p>
    Not alone in this characterization, these two songs are tiny and
    initially unmemorable, with lyrics that thrive within their tumbleweed
    structures and attention-deficit rhythms. Breaks don't occur so much
    between tracks as during them, making for a piecemeal song cycle united
    by organic, metallic percussion, fiery explosions of static guitar-led
    noise, gorgeously out-of-place male-female vocals, and the odd moment
    of folk (briefly anthemic ""Peace""), punk (""Hope""), and tropicalia
    (""Merchandise"").
    </p>
<p>
    The aptly named ""Kantanker"" is smacked on the end of the harmonious,
    deeply moving elegy ""Boy"". The contrast poses with tongue in cheek,
    hoping to cause discomfort: The acidic ""Kantanker"" is a little more
    than a minute long; by contrast, ""Boy"" is stretched to a comparitively
    epic four minutes. It coaxes along on piano and strings-- including
    harp-- caressive, pulsating guitar and hollow, angelic vocals before
    being eventually destroyed by ""Kantanker""'s bang-on-a-can drums.
    </p>
<p>
    The wait
    for ""Boy"" was only 18 minutes, but it felt longer. Despite some robust
    and generally wordless pit stops, there are too many breaks in focus-- or rather,
    disparate focal points that at worst distract and, at best, leave the
    listener wanting more time alone with them. A more uniform vision or an
    outside editorial hand could successfully reinterpret Rafter's clear
    ambition, harnessing all these preludes and giving them a lush,
    lingering spotlight.

    Listen closely to the tail end of the first verse of
    Alasdair Roberts' ""Where Twines the Path"" and you can hear something that
    shouldn't be there: An empty promise. ""When
    the map and fact mismatch, I will burn the map,"" claims Roberts above an
    acoustic guitar, sounding like a perfect gentleman but lying like a playboy.
    Roberts is arguing for self-reliance and adventure, vouching for a little
    transcendental wisdom in a trance-happy world. This could be an anthem.
    Instead, it's the moment that explains Roberts' fourth LP, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Amber
    Gatherers</span><span>: He wouldn't dare burn
    anything. At best, he'd (politely) ask the map to set itself on fire. Then he'd
    relish in the glow of the fire's flicker.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Roberts is obsessed with human frailty and manmade failure.
    On opener ""Riddle Me This"", he bemoans the man-led denigration of nature;
    he takes hopeful love and turns it into an old-world murder ballad starring cheating,
    jealousy, and bribery for ""The Cruel War"". But Roberts seems too cool and
    collected for these songs' good: He's the vigilant
    reporter watching things go up in smoke, then looking for an allegory. Only 29, he's a smart, seasoned
    writer and arranger, turning subtle tricks with alternate guitar tunings (on 11
    songs, he uses 11 tunings, dropping the low E string all the way to an F). He
    couples complex internal and external rhymes more often than not, and he
    commands expansive mythological and geographical vocabularies. During the beaming ""River Rhine"", for instance, Roberts
    uses his native Scotland's Clyde River as a symbol of supplication. Compared to
    his lover's majestic Rhine, his Clyde is inferior. ""Where does the Rhine rise?
    It rises in her eyes,"" he sings, a resplendent six-string acoustic and the
    backing shimmer of an electric making the whole thing shine. He's cleverly
    enamored, and that's endearing.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But that's not the case with at least eight of 11 tracks
    here, not that you'd know it on first listen: When Roberts turns his pen and
    his band to more somber material, his sonic approach is achingly consistent.
    ""Let Me Lie and Bleed Awhile"" closes with the suggestion of redemption, but the
    entire song-- lyrically, all black imagery and innocence botched-- <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">sounds</span><span> like business as usual. Roberts writes about
    downfall and return, but his derma-brazed presentations make him sound like
    he's nothing but stable.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    These, of course, are questions addressing the equilibrium between folk preservation and progress.
    Roberts isn't a traditionalist. He's too dependent on punchy rock dynamics and
    stick-to-snare percussion for the purists. But he does play his cards close to
    the vest, trading in the empirical, map-burning adventure of ""Where Twines the
    Path"" for observations behind a glass wall. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Amber Gatherer</span><span> doesn't need to be louder or more aggressive. It
    just needs to be less perfect in order to suggest that Roberts isn't spinning
    yarns or singing fables he read somewhere. The 30-year-old Josh Ritter musses
    up folk forms to emerge breathing equal parts fire and flair, while
    sexagenarian Vashti Bunyan musses the idiom just enough to claim it as her own.
    </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But not Roberts: During ""I Had a Kiss of the King's Hand"",
    ""The King"" emerges from the sea, and Roberts is the Samaritan narrator. He
    shows attention, kisses the King's hand, and is rewarded with a barrel of the
    King's wine. But the entire saga is treated as though such sights are common.
    If it was a bit less blasé, it could be a corollary to the beatitudes. Here and
    elsewhere, though, Roberts sounds neither damaged nor repaired and fighting
    back. And when you're trying to show a crowd what it's like to reckon with
    dangerous seas, cruel skies and unforgiving lands, it's important to show the
    scars-- or at least pretend you have them.

    Hey kids, what are you doing with your college education?
    When they were students at Annapolis's St. John's College, Jac Holzman and Paul
    Rickholt co-founded Elektra Records in their dorm room. They specialized in
    folk music, partly because it was inexpensive to record and partly because in
    1950 folk had a sizable audience. It was a cult genre growing into a popular
    one. In addition to releasing numerous collections of ethnic folk music,
    Elektra recorded the likes of Theodore Bikel, Josh White, and the New York Jazz
    Quartet, and competed with Vanguard and Verve Records. But during the 1960s,
    the label signed better-known artists such as Judy Collins, Phil Ochs, and Tom
    Rush, then expanded its roster to include jazz, blues, bluegrass, blues rock, country
    rock, psych rock, lite rock, and various combinations of each. It even spun off
    an imprint, Nonesuch Explorer Series, specializing in world music. Elektra released
    albums by Love, the Doors, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Bread, Carly Simon, the
    Lovin' Spoonful, Tim Buckley, and even Eric Clapton &amp; Powerhouse, which not
    only cemented its reputation as a top label for a variety of music, but also
    helped to shape and define popular music as a whole.</p><p>
    As its name suggests, the 5xCD set <em>Forever Changing: The Golden Age of Elektra Records 1963-1973</em>
    chronicles the label's heyday; the emphasis rests on its calculated eclecticism
    rather than dry chronology. Listening to these discs is not unlike flipping
    through a museum's permanent collection catalog: It gives a larger context for
    what was going on at the time, but allows you to appreciate the music on its
    own formal merits. Released in the UK last year and finally making it to the
    States, the set includes all the artists you'd expect, as well as a generous
    serving of lesser-known signees who make the set seem like one great, new
    discovery (Judy Henske, Pat Kilroy) after another (Eclection, Earth Opera).</p><p>
    The first discs, obviously, are heavy with folk music, or,
    to quote Elektra producer Paul Rothchild's liner blurb, ""root American music as
    performed by new urban interpreters."" While Elektra artists Phil Ochs, Tom
    Paxton, Fred Neil, the Incredible String Band, Judy Collins, and Tom Rush were
    categorized broadly under folk, these artists covered a range of territory:
    political songs like Ochs's triumphantly dissident ""I Ain't Marching Anymore""
    and Richard Fariña's ""House Un-American Blues Activity Dream"" rub shoulders
    with the personal ruminations of Judy Collins' ""Both Sides Now"" and the bluesy
    disaffection of Henske's powerful ""High Flying Bird"". <em>Forever Changing</em> also incorporates other ""root American music,"" like
    the bluegrass of the Dillards, the revival blues of ""Spider"" John Koerner, the
    careful compositions of guitarist Dick Rosmini, and the jug-band jazz of the
    Even Dozen Jug Band. Amazingly, no artist on <em>Forever Changing</em> sounds like a token act. 
    </p>
<p>
    Elektra's crucial signing, however, was Love. The legendary L.A.
    band gave the label its first charting single, ""My Little Red Book"" (which
    kicks off Disc 2), and allowed Holzman
    entrée into the local scene. According to the liners, Love frontman Arthur Lee
    persuaded Holzman to see the Doors, whom Elektra signed shortly thereafter. Love
    and the Doors each get three tracks, including the former's ""Alone Again Or""
    and the latter's ""Five to One"" (which, in this context, is enough to reverse my
    low opinion on the Doors), and they proved to be gateway acts into the rock
    world. Afterwards, Elektra signed MC5 (whose ""Kick Out the Jams"" is included),
    the Stooges, and Queen, as well as lesser-knowns like Eclection and Rhinoceros.
    Despite these successes, the label continued to emphasize folk, which put it at
    the forefront of the early 70s singer-songwriter movement with Bread, Harry
    Chapin, and Carly Simon.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Forever Changing</em>,
    as its name implies, presents a label that adjusted to the changing times
    without sacrificing its eclecticism. Fortunately, this progression from
    acoustic to electric doesn't determine the loosely chronological tracklist,
    which instead is calculated to highlight the individual songs. This is
    especially true on the final disc, entitled ""Another Time, Another Place"", which
    might best be described as a bonus. It combines obscure singles by popular acts
    or solid singles by obscure acts in a vault-clearing set that could itself be a
    primer on the label. It may not be the best disc in the set: The Beefeaters'
    ""Don't Be Long"" is no longer a rare single after appearing on last year's Byrds
    box set, and Eric Clapton &amp; the Powerhouse's predictable take on
    ""Crossroads"" won't change anyone's opinion on the fading guitar god. But tracks
    by Eclection, Goodthunder, Leviathan, David Peel &amp; the Lower
    East Side, and Jobriath-- not to mention Tim Buckley's otherworldly
    ""Wayfaring Stranger"", which completely reinvents the traditional song-- demonstrate
    how deep Elektra's roster ran.
    </p>
<p>
    The label's independence did not survive long into the
    1970s. Elektra became part of Warner Communications and was eventually merged
    with Asylum Records. Holzman abdicated his position at Elektra for a heralded
    tenure as Warner senior vice president. The label still exists, and its E logo
    has graced albums by artists as diverse as the Cure, Emmylou Harris, Metallica,
    Björk, and, um, Jet. However, the legacy of Holzman's second decade at the head
    of Elektra went far beyond the range of its roster-- after all, contemporaneous
    labels were far from homogenous. Rather, <em>Forever
    Changing</em> suggests the label's greatest achievement was its intuitive
    presentation of all these clashing styles both as roots music with a rich
    tradition and as pop music with a potentially large audience.

    health care-- they hate our freedom. As such, it's only a matter of
    time before the U.S. administration runs out of predominantly Muslim
    countries to test its ordinance on and decides it's time to bomb
    these uppity Swedes off the map. When this inevitably happens, cultural
    anthropologists sifting through the Swedish music that's made so much
    headway in the States over the past couple of years will be presented with
    a rather misleading portrait of the country.</p><p>
    Studying music by I'm From Barcelona, Peter Bjorn and John, and Jens
    Lekman, they'll conclude that Ben Gibbard and Stuart Murdoch
    collaboratively authored the kingdom's public school English
    curriculum, explaining why Swedes, who must be as diverse as anyone
    else when expressing in their own tongue, turn into starry-eyed
    ingénues when they sing in English. They'll knit together a portrait of
    a populace with polarized emotions-- the most fantastic whimsy on one
    hand, and the most plangent melancholy on the other-- that spends all
    its time swooning joyfully into each others' arms or staring forlornly
    out of windows.</p><p>
    At the level of content, Sweden's Emil Svanängen (who records full-band
    songs by himself as Loney, Dear) is of a piece with recent Swedish
    indie pop imports. He's sorry-- honestly sorry-- that he ruined your day.
    He gets things wrong; he's not accustomed to this. Every lyric on <em>Loney, Noir</em>
    is engineered to express Svanängen's sensitivity, earnest romanticism,
    and stubborn optimism. The record brims with the cultivated naiveté of
    classic anorak music, with Svanängen's lovelorn musings revolving
    around the uncertainty of first crushes, not the grim intractability of
    troubled adult relationships.
    </p><p>
    Despite the current Swede-pop trend's homogeneity, I never tire of it when it's well-turned (as <em>Loney, Noir</em>
    is), because it allows me access to an emotional space that I've long
    since left behind, one of sweetness and simplicity that's a welcome
    respite from adulthood's befogged relativism. This is comfort music,
    and comfort never goes out of style. And while the aura of dreamy
    romantic abstraction is the same, Svanängen distinguishes himself from
    his peers on the structural level. 
    </p>
<p>
    While at times <em>Loney, Noir</em> indulges in IFB-style
    Swede-pop's jangly bounce-- the excellent ""I Am John"" trampolines a
    exuberant falsetto refrain off of fleet acoustic guitar, dainty chimes,
    and soft horns-- the bulk of the record is smoother and darker, with a
    perpetual sense of lubricated glide. The songs tend to start small, and
    then wax orchestral as Svanängen layers emphases onto his simple
    melodies. ""Sinister in a State of Hope"" coasts in on glimmering synths
    and a chunky guitar strum, tightly wound, which gradually open out with
    hymn-like fervor. ""I Will Call You Lover Again"" builds a whirling
    minuet around its spongy synth tones; ""Saturday Waits"" starts as terse
    acoustic pop and ends in a swirl of farty bass and efflorescent
    harmonies. 
    </p>
<p>
    The music's twinkling churn is a pleasure, but Svanängen's voice is the
    emphatic thread that holds it together and tends to commandeer your
    attention. It's high and oil-slick, frequently glowing into a neon
    falsetto. At once soft and garish, it describes a tremulous yet
    pitch-perfect weave through his glassy range. The wispy, trailing notes
    he breathes through the gentle synth-pop of ""And I Won't Cause Anything at
    All"" are impossibly winsome; ditto the low murmurs on the baggy,
    waltz-timed ""I Am The Odd One"". It hardly matters what Svanängen is
    saying or how he's saying it-- his voice sounds as lovely at rest in a
    single note as it does in motion through several. It lends itself to
    clichés about comfortable old blankets and the like. This is perhaps
    the music's downside-- the omnipresent comeliness of Svanängen's voice
    can start to bore into your skull after awhile. After all, even the
    comfiest blanket chafes if someone's giving you an Indian
    burn with it.

    When I woke up early this morning, it was still dark, but I could see that snow had begun to settle on the woods (a rarity in post-global warming North Carolina). My first half-asleep
    thought was of Radicalfashion's ""Suna""-- a perfect complement, with
    its crystalline piano keys, to a crisp and snowy day. My second
    thought, irrationally, was that my Radicalfashion deadline had
    summoned the unexpected snow.</p><p>
    Japanese composer Hirohito Ihara (also unfortunately known as
    Radicalfashion) uses a concise sound palette-- mostly minimal electronic
    textures and flowing piano-- to make music that charges whatever space it
    inhabits with eerie significance. This is strange, beautiful music, with few
    interpretative cues: The delicate trickles and singing reverberations of ""Opening"" evokes metal and water, while the sprightly tones of
    ""Ballet"" straddle a compelling rhythm track that defies
    identification beyond something rolling, tearing, and clattering.
    ""Shunpoudoh"" and ""Photo Dynasmo"" both use the human voice
    as their rhythmic foundation, the former kneading clipped, contrasting
    syllables into its thwacking bounce, the latter threading sinister vowels between anxious piano phrases.</p><p>
    It's a small leap from believing that a record can alter one's perception to
    believing that it can alter the physical world, and in the dream space <em>Odori</em>
    inhabits, there's no difference. It may sound obscure to say so, but it's really
    impossible to do the record justice without mentioning its uncanny emulation of
    dreams, where meaning is felt but unnamed, backward logic prevails, and
    half-formed apparitions swirl. The imagery is so
    spectral, and the movement of Ihara's compositions so intuitive, that <em>Odori</em>
    feels purely subconscious. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Shousetsu"", with its ethereal
    piano nocturne and corporeal rhythm track (a gasp, a gulp, and the clipped chirp of
    medical equipment) treads the thin line between reality and imagination. Ihara,
    who's fond of the epiphany and works it into most of his compositions, gets in
    a great one here, when the piano finally breaks free of the claustrophobic
    rhythm and soars. And there's another on Carl Stone collaboration
    ""Thousand"" in the bright, clear tone that sporadically bursts through
    the spring-wound mix.
    </p>
<p>
    The other reason that I immediately equated the snow with Radicalfashion is
    the associative link between the two. We could talk about the snow's quietude,
    its serene chill, its atmosphere-filling quality, its delicate grace, or its
    dreamy childhood nostalgia-- <em>Odori </em>has all these qualities, but diverges
    from them on tracks like ""Toh-Koh"", whose blossoming squiggles are
    more fire than ice. But it never deviates from its most striking parallel with
    snow: the sense of magical transformation it invokes. The semi-lucid state of
    wonder the pre-dawn dusting inspired in me was identical to how I felt the
    first time I heard this record-- the feeling of passing through the mundane and
    into the marvelous without warning.

    Nurse &amp; Soldier has the potential to be too casual and too indulgent. It
    is, after all, a side project between Oneida frontman Bobby Matador and his
    longtime partner Erica Fletcher, and their debut release is on the main band's
    own vanity imprint, Brah. I'd understand if the incestuous nature of the
    project was designed to ward off certain potential listeners, those that might
    predetermine this release as a footnote to be skipped when Oneida's own
    catalog-- with its double discs and side-long tracks-- is pretty daunting.</p><p>
    If you were to hear the first two or three tracks from <em>Marginalia</em>--
    not the most encouraging title-- and stop there, those potential fears might
    even be confirmed. ""Green Tea"" is a bluesy organ drone, with a slight
    touch of dissonance like an update of the <em>Exorcist</em> theme running through
    the track's background, but it establishes more of a drumless, hazy atmosphere
    without congealing into a hook or a song. ""Capture the Flag"" gurgles
    with some actual percussion and clearer vocals from Fletcher, all drowned out
    by sheets of distortion and limp with hesitancy. ""In the Dark"" is
    catchier, certainly, but its simple rhymes sound glib and lazy over its basic
    melody.</p><p>
    But <em>Marginalia</em> is unusual in that it actually gets better the further
    you get into the record. Certainly, the fidelities are low and the tempos
    relaxed, and the faux-quilted album art further underlines the gentle,
    easygoing nature of the music therein. Still, the songs get sharper as the
    album progresses, and the group's particular talents announce themselves.
    ""Back in Yr Corner"" has a subtle table-tapping percussion and gorgeous
    layering of piercing vintage organ tones, and ""Brought Up Too Soon"" is
    an improvement upon the earlier ""In the Dark"", still simple but more
    gradual with its buildup and stronger in melody. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's some similarity to Sunset Rubdown here, at least in the spartan
    nature of recordings like ""Wrong"", with its faraway perpetual reverb
    on the guitar and nostalgic bent of its simple progression. These tracks are
    warm and inviting, however, where Spencer Krug's are cagey and stark.
    ""What You Wanted"" continues in that vein in precious minor-key folk
    plucking and saccharine self-harmonizing from Fletcher. ""Lies &amp;
    Alterations"" piles on something like a wall of guitars, but its more like
    a lapping low tide of distortion under Fletcher's brassy singing, and they're
    suddenly sounding like a band instead of a project. 
    </p>
<p>
    By the time you reach the pride-swollen vocals on closing track ""Her
    Higher Education"", adorned with dizzying amounts of tiny embellishments
    like rattling calliope percussion and horn fanfare, you'll be pissed the
    album's over just when it's hitting its potential. It's almost as if they
    recorded <em>Marginalia</em> as they went along, one track after another, off the
    top their heads. All that just adds to the quaint homespun vibe of the group;
    it might sound lazy on paper, but the unpretentious nature of the presentation
    actually adds to the music, making Nurse &amp; Soldier like a scrapbook or
    photo album that's far too well kept to be a curio. Talented hands have to stay
    busy somehow.

    For a time at the beginning of this century, Adam Butler's Vert project was
    terrifically promising. I maintain that his debut full-length <em>The Köln
    Konzert</em> is one of the triumphs of musical referencing, the way it alludes
    to and comments on Keith Jarrett's masterpiece both directly via samples and
    indirectly via mood and texture. And his follow-up, <em>Nine Types of Ambiguity</em>,
    released while he was opening for Mouse on Mars during their <em>Idiology </em>tour,
    integrated warped instrumental pop tendencies with effective
    busted-transmission ambiance. But Butler has been pretty quiet since releasing
    the seldom-heard <em>Small Pieces Loosely Joined </em>mini-LP in 2003, which
    extended some of <em>Nine Types</em>' experiments while moving toward acoustic instrumentation,
    and then nothing since this record in late 2006.</p><p>
    What first comes to mind is that he might have chosen another pseudonym for <em>Some
    Beans &amp; an Octopus</em>, since it bears no resemblance to anything
    previously released under the Vert name. In brief, <em>Some Beans </em>finds
    Butler trying his hand at vocal-based music that falls somewhere between
    low-key, Streets-informed rap and rhythmic spoken word. He spins odd and
    surreal tales over a busy, indistinct backing that alludes to ragtime, hip-hop,
    AM radio ballads, jazz swing, and Kurt Weil, to name just a few touchstones.</p><p>
    While this admittedly original concoction looks good on paper, the music
    sounds fussy, static, overcooked and, ultimately, flat. Small samples are
    packed together into a tight ball and then strung out like ragged clothes on a
    line; everything sounds two-dimensional and overly trebly with no drive. Butler
    isn't a bad rapper, though that word isn't quite accurate; his rhythmic sense
    is decent and there's no reason why he shouldn't be making vocal records. The
    sound of the thing is the problem. The opening ""Gretchen Askew"" has a
    decent chorus hook but the clanging beat piles up handclaps, standup bass, ugly
    saxes, metal-on-metal percussion, and assorted synth noises without sounding
    dynamic or forceful. ""This One"" entwines a halting dancehall beat
    with a Middle Eastern melody, banging piano, and tabla samples, but each hit
    sounds noisy and 8-bit cheap. 
    </p>
<p>
    Oddly for an artist with such a background in subtle textural manipulation, <em>Some
    Beans </em>is most enjoyable at is quietest and simplest. ""October"" is
    basically just a straightforward, sentimental piano ballad, and while Butler's
    singing voice is serviceable at best, the track's warmth and quietly effective
    hints of processing are a welcome respite from the clutter. 
    </p>
<p>
    For the most part I like ambiguity and mystery in music-- to put on a record
    and wonder to myself what exactly the artist might have been thinking. With so
    much music that slots so easily into well-worn, widely understood categories, it's
    nice when a record resists such classification. But sometimes, the ""What
    was he thinking?"" question never yields to actual listening
    pleasure, and you wind up with something intriguing and possibly even
    courageous that you nonetheless never have the slightest desire to listen to.

    Of all the big British rock bands of the moment, Bloc Party are probably the guys who take themselves the most seriously. As smart people go, they're surprisingly convinced of their own capacity to say something meaningful. They're just as serious about the possibilities of grand, ambitious pop/rock. Whether it's the messianic hooks of U2, the far-reaching drama of Radiohead, or the grandiose sensitivity of Coldplay, most indie rockers approach stepping lightly and sounding self-conscious; Bloc Party come at them with a sincerity that can seem almost naïve, almost teenaged. And with music and image both totally free of the attitude we expect from young, clever bands-- there's no humor, irony, cynicism, or snot, and never a trace of cool-guy apathy-- they seem as earnest and serious-minded as seminarians or door-to-door campaign volunteers.</p><p>
    All of this could have led them down the path to an absolutely dreadful second album: pompous, preachy, overreaching, and <em>still</em> dull. But then there's the other side of their seriousness. Judging by their records, Bloc Party are awfully dedicated to the craft and the details of making this stuff: From their first songs onward, they've been cruising through big tricks with a studied ease that makes you wonder why other bands find it so difficult. If they have the demeanor of rock's teacher's pets, they have the talent and the work ethic, too-- they're attentive, conscientious, and good at what they do. And this keeps them … well, convincing.</p><p>
    And so when <em>A Weekend in the City</em> comes bursting out at you with a gaggle of second-album upgrades-- new tricks, new scope, new arrangements-- the bulk of them sound like good ideas: They've been executed by hard-working professionals. The opener has singer Kele Okerere trying on a sly, potentially embarrassing falsetto, but within a minute the band's starting to kick up dust, on its way to a chorus hook that's loose, energetic, and honestly thrilling: It's the kind of craftsmanship that would sound good coming from nearly anyone. ""Hunting for Witches"" fakes you out with a sample collage at the top, then takes on xenophobia in a dutiful re-take on the band's first hit, ""Banquet"". And then there's ""Waiting for the 7:18"", the best summary yet of the band's personality: unfashionably starry-eyed at the start, then running its way up to huge hooks and guitar heroism that feel a lot more fierce and weighty than you'd think. Through it all, they're upping the technical ante, too-- Matt Tong drumming tricksy rhythms alongside computer programs, Russell Lissack stepping out from between synthesizer choirs with a string of squalling guitar leads. It's darker, broader, and more desperate than their debut, and through its first half-- when they're front-loading the hooks and energy-- it's difficult to imagine what they might have done better.</p><p>
    Okerere's lyrics reach a lot farther, too, which both helps and hurts. Looked at line by line, there's plenty of clumsiness, and the words don't do much to dispel the band's earnest-undergraduate feel. The subject matter and the sentiments, though, are starting to shine brighter, and not on the Big Topics. A pair of rather complicated songs-- ""The Prayer"" and ""On""-- are spent begging both drugs and the powers that be for the power to live out nightlife fantasies: ""Tonight make me unstoppable/ And I will charm, I will slice/ I will dazzle them with my wit."" Elsewhere, Okerere starts to sing about his own sexuality and love life: This may be the moment where the earnest undergrad, always more comfortable writing about Issues, starts learning to reveal.</p><p>
    But of course there's always the part where it all starts to drag. Bloc Party's sound may have a lot to do with the many bands these days that have been influenced by post-punk, but the truth is that-- sincere young men that they are-- they have none of the punk-bred skepticism or self-censorship of the average indie act. This is, without doubt, a good thing, and a nice change. But at times it really <em>does</em> let the band get pompous and dull: When they go wrong, it almost always comes in the form of easy drama or their visile sappy streak, two things they turn out not to be as skilled with as you'd think. Maybe it's just that the hooks aren't working, but ""Uniform"", the longest song on the record-- spent taking the kids to task for their ""masks of cool and indifference""-- is a chore: Self-serious, schoolmarmish, convinced it's being dramatic when it's mostly just being boring. And the second half of <em>A Weekend in the City</em> keeps falling into similar traps: Drama that's more ponderous than ominous, and ballads that shoot for slick, sensitive pop-chart appeal, but come off fluffy, underinspired, or strangely retro-- stuff that would have felt heavy in 1995, but seems too doe-eyed and green today.</p><p>
    Still, one can't help but be impressed by these guys. They're a rare rock band, after all-- such skilled craftsmen that they can hang on to indie fans even as they aim, with striking earnestness, to be the kind of band who show up on ""first album I ever bought"" lists.

    Andrew Whiteman, Broken Social Scene guitarist and Apostle of Hustle bandleader, is not an apostle, he's a hustler of hospital-cornered quilt of breezy, bouncy pop, with all of his more famous band's overlapping propulsion, but little of its chaotic bliss.</p><p>
    Where <em>Folkloric Feel </em>opted for cobwebby murk, <em>National Anthem of Nowhere</em> dovetails in bright, tidy corners. It's at once straight-laced and funky in the way that only indie rock can be. Tight, molded percussion and luxuriantly fluffed basslines make clean passes through delicately reverbed sheets of guitar and lathed synths. Affable vocals remake the music's nighttime throb as afternoon flirtation. The first record found Whiteman hung up on Cuban music, but <em>National Anthem of Nowhere</em> seems less discriminating in which genre particles it assimilates. The accumulation doesn't change the music's vanilla flavor, but it makes it bolder: The languorous ""NoNoNo"" threads throttled hand percussion through smoldering gypsy folk; the icily cragged ""Jimmy Scott Is the Answer"" is a mild-mannered indie rock approximation of classic soul; the post-rocky squalls of ""Fast Pony for Victor Jara"" are shot through with juicy tropicalia. On ""Haul Away"", Whiteman even manages to merge two of indie rock's favorite exotic templates-- the Western movie twang and the sea chantey.</p><p>
    Whiteman is aptly named-- there's a stiffness to his swing that, despite the house beat pulsing through ""My Sword Hand's Anger"" and the svelte disco bass on ""The Naked &amp; Alone"", makes it better for headphones than dancing. This is an audiophile's record that encourages appreciative observation more than participatory engagement. Whiteman's vocals are strikingly similar to Jason Collett's; they have the same grainy, ingenuous croon, but the music deftly assembled around it makes Apostle a different thing that BSS (less rock) or Collett's solo project (less rustic). Galumphing percussion and angelic synths flesh out the fluidly hitching indie rock of ""Cheap like Sebastian"", and the vivid yet carefully time guitar fireworks of the title track are capped with a breath-arresting horn finale. By the time the piano filigrees of ""A Rent Boy Goes Down"" leaned into a mean, distorted cha-cha-cha, I was charmed enough to berth on Whiteman's international cruise ship, even though it really felt more like reading a <em>Let's Go! </em>guide than traveling.

    Masaki Batoh, vocalist and spiritual leader of Japan's enigmatic
    collective Ghost, has a stated aversion to such mundane activities as
    recording and touring, with his interest in music almost entirely
    limited to the moment of creation itself. As a consequence, the
    increasingly infrequent arrival of a new Ghost album has begun to feel
    like a monumental event. Such is certainly the case for <em>In Stormy Nights</em>, the group's first collection of new material since its majestic 2004 prog-epic <em>Hypnotic Underworld</em>.</p><p>
    Throughout their mystery-steeped, two decade-plus career, the members
    of Ghost have steadfastly refused to acknowledge divisions between
    their seemingly incompatible styles of psych-folk, Krautrock, free
    jazz, and a limitless variety of indigenous Japanese and world musics.
    On their latest tablet from the mount, Batoh and a core sextet that
    includes veteran psych guitarist Michio Kurihara, multi-instrumentalist
    Kazuo Ogino, and percussionist Junzo Tateiwa have again decided to move
    their sound outward in all directions at once. <em>In Stormy Night</em>
    progresses with a solemn yet utterly savage authority, with its
    turbulent mixture of organic stoner-folk, cumbrous experimentation and
    near-martial rhythms sounding like an invocation to counteract the
    government-led turmoil of its times.</p><p>
    The album's cornerstone-- and the piece most likely to divide
    opinions-- is the self-contained 28-minute behemoth ""Hemicyclic
    Anthelion"". Painstakingly edited by Batoh from a number of live
    recordings, this track appears in essence to be a double measure of
    free improvisation, first in the live performances themselves and later
    at the mixing desk. Due to its rather episodic construction, at points
    the piece can recall the more meditative moments of <em>The Faust Tapes, </em>but
    Ghost is also careful to allow the music to unfold as if an evolving,
    real-time performance. Underpinned by a recurring pattern of feedback
    and amp distortion, ""Hemicyclic Anthelion"" travels patiently through
    interludes of pastoral folk and dusky, smoked-glass jazz, while still
    allowing Kurihara ample space to rip off several radiant acid guitar
    leads. At points it seems Batoh has made some curious editing
    decisions: There are several quiet stretches of virtual inactivity
    as the musicians appear a little too content to dawdle within their
    time-collapsing idyll. 
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps as a corrective, Ghost immediately follows ""Anthelion"" with a
    trio of tympani-driven rock songs that are as furiously precise and
    martial as the preceding epic is diffuse. ""Water Door Yellow Gate""
    layers its taut riff with orchestral percussion, analog synth, and a
    spectral backing choir, while Batoh gravely intones his nightmarish
    visions of a scorched-earth no man's land. Even wilder and more massive
    is the group's ferocious cover of the tribal anthem ""Caledonia"",
    originally recorded by ESP Disk pagans Cromagnon. Given the rampant
    experimentation elsewhere on the album, Ghost give this cover a
    surprisingly faithful and reverent treatment, with Batoh delivering
    what is likely his most shredded vocal on record beneath a feverish
    torrent of Celtic flutes and recorder drones. 
    </p>
<p>
    Bookending all this chaotic activity are two of Ghost's loveliest
    avant-folk tracks to date, ""Motherly Bluster"" and the stunning closer
    ""Grisaille"". Carried gently aloft by its gorgeous arrangement of
    medieval strings, flutes, and yet another sky-melting Kurihara solo,
    ""Grisaille"" is further evidence that Ghost can still return to the
    exquisite psych-folk territories of past triumphs like 1999's <em>Snuffbox Immanence</em> any time they so choose. And though <em>In Stormy Nights</em>-- with
    its numerous false leads, over-the-top presentation and undisguised
    self-indulgence-- can hardly be said to be a perfect work, one has to
    admire and celebrate Ghost's determination never to step in the same
    river twice.

    each song feels like the work of a supergroup. From the get-go, opener ""Nothing Without You
    (Tery Bina)"", the listener is flooded with the image of close to a
    dozen musicians hanging out together under the baton of Sushil K. Dade
    (Soup Dragon, Telstar Ponies, BMX Bandits). Since 1997 Dade has been
    writing work drawn from dozens of collaborations and here Belle &amp; Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch, and
    Sarah Martin, Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon, Damo Suzuki, and many more
    align their experiences to suit Dade's reverential folk vision. The
    result is a series of elegant interludes, infused as much with Dade's
    vision as with the oeuvres of the musicians he's brought on board.</p><p>
    ""Nothing Without You"", a twinkling folk rendition of Pakistani song
    by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, makes a fine opening point for a record full of songs with similar languorous flourishes.
    The angelic counterpoints between guitar, banjo, and reverbing vocals
    are thank-you notes to a 1960s folk rock aesthetic, implacably
    nostalgic without being trite. What directly follows, ""The City of
    Lights"", is a robust song with a piano as its backbone: The fluid
    chordal movements across the keyboard even get their own cadenza in the
    midst of a jam that's, in the end, another interlude. A BMX Bandits fan
    site astutely calls Dade ""the bloke who puts those great interludes"" on
    BMX Bandits albums, and indeed, the brevity and fluidity of <em>Secrets</em>' tracks ensures their standalone, episodic nature.</p><p>
    One of the longer tracks, ""Nuclear
    War"", is a free jazz
    undertaking, with short, percussive utterances, muttered lines like ""Kiss
    your ass goodbye,"" slippery special effects, and a smattering of
    saxophones and bass reaching through a smoky, whirling atmosphere
    commit themselves rapaciously to our memory without the slightest
    affectation and little tonal emphasis. One of the most
    improvisational tracks, the song is an interlude within an interlude, a
    piece of thought reflection less traditional than its companions.
    </p><p>
    Dade posits ""Shenandoah"", an early 19th century sea chantey
    (elsewhere covered by Bob Dylan), within the highland tradition,
    emphasizing in spite of the song's Stateside origin that much of this
    album and its contributors are culling their inspiration from the
    flavors of the British Isles. The c&amp;w flavor of
    ""A-N-U-R-U-D-H"", with a looping guitar trot in 2/2 and a wash of slide
    guitar throughout, draws in cool, aerated female vocals lost in the fog
    of subtle effects and quiet additions from an organ, making it a gem
    that stands out, but not isolated from its relatives.
    </p>
<p>
    As emphasized by the hilarious track ""Word Association"", Dade's
    interest is in the playful interlocutions between his special guests;
    what's furthering these interlocutions are homages to traditions that
    succeed in part because of the guests' longstanding relationships to
    them. The genre hoarding and blending exemplified by the pairing of
    say, the tingling pop song ""Eyes of Love"" (featuring two Belle and
    Sebastians) with the free-form ""Nuclear War"" emphasizes this album's
    progressive flavor; its historical celebration is created by seasoned
    believers and innovators, whose evident pleasure in referencing a
    colorful trajectory is the only requirement-- besides talent-- of
    making this work relevant.

    It's hard not to admire the three-decade career of Slovenia's Laibach. Over
    20-plus releases, the band has crafted its own universe, an imaginary
    political-art state dubbed the Neue Slowenische Kunst (i.e. New Slovenian Art).
    Such intricate self-mythology is rivaled only by that of the Residents-- both
    groups boast anonymous members, theatrical performances, and an affinity for
    concept albums. Laibach even has a lead voice-- an unmistakable Teutonic
    growl-- that stalks the songs the way the Residents' main warbler haunts his
    band's albums. It all makes you wonder if anyone has ever seen both groups in the
    same room.</p><p>
    But that comparison falls flat when it comes to musical innovation. Where
    the Residents' unique, influential sound still feels fresh, Laibach's music has
    rarely broken new ground, and in recent years has become increasingly generic.
    In that sense, <em>Volk</em> is a typical late-period Laibach album. Here we get
    an intriguing concept-- adaptations of national anthems-- that seems ripe for
    political commentary and sonic transformation. Yet the album is quickly dragged
    down by unchallenging, forgettable music.</p><p>
    Take ""Espana"", an interpretation of the Spanish National Anthem.
    Our hero's chanting of the tune's simple lyrics is oddly compelling. But his
    growl is wrapped inside generic synth-pop with cheesy keyboards and clichéd
    backing vocals. It comes off as a decent replica of the Psychedelic Furs circa <em>Pretty
    in Pink</em> or David Bowie circa <em>Let's Dance</em>, but how Laibach could find
    that worn-out sound worth mimicking (or relevant to Spain) is hard to fathom.
    </p>
<p>
    Things get even worse when the band tries to be clever.
    ""America""'s lazy take on the ""Star Spangled Banner"" (""Are your
    stars still so bright? / Does your banner still wave?"") barely rises to
    the level of high-school satire (generic techno beats and televangelist samples
    don't help). On ""Anglia"", a toothless critique of England's political
    arrogance sits limply atop a sub-Nine Inch Nails throb, while
    ""Rossiya""'s combo of drum machine and child chorus is Moby-lite, if
    such a thing is even possible.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Volk </em>isn't devoid of worthy moments. ""Germania"" is a nice
    mix of piano and earnest crooning that recalls Antony and the Johnsons;
    ""Nippon"" turns the Japanese national anthem into a string-heavy rock
    opera; and the surprisingly straight choral hymn of ""Vaticanae"" is
    stirring. But even those tracks are more like well-executed genre exercises
    than original music.
    </p>
<p>
    It's telling that the best piece on <em>Volk</em> is the album-ending anthem
    of Laibach's own fictional nation. A scratchy marching-band piece that sounds
    dubbed from vinyl, with lyrics sung by a Stephen Hawking clone, ""NSK""
    is a strong reminder of how weird and fascinating this band can be. But it's an
    even stronger reminder of how indistinct and inconsequential the rest of <em>Volk</em>
    is.

    Somehow, the Band continue to be most gossiped-about for their pivotal role in Bob Dylan's famed acoustic-electric trajectory: In 1967, Dylan invited his touring band (then nameless, but occasionally going by the Hawks or the Crackers or the Honkies) to record a series of demos in the basement of a house in Woodstock, New York. The resulting double LP, which wasn't officially released until 1975, was dubbed ""the greatest album in the history of popular American music"" by <em>The New York Times</em>, inspired a full-length book by Greil Marcus, and fed perfectly into Dylan's ever-aggrandizing mythology. Despite loads of critical acclaim for their solo debut, 1968's excellent <em>Music From Big Pink</em>, The Band never quite wiggled out from Dylan's considerable shadow, or transcended the legendary intrigue of <em>The Basement Tapes</em>.</p><p>
<em>Endless Highway: The Music of the Band</em> attempts to rectify the Band's little-brother standing, recruiting artists like the Allman Brothers, My Morning Jacket, Death Cab for Cutie, Roseanne Cash, and Lee Ann Womack to celebrate the Band's discography, on the 30th anniversary of the filming of <em>The Last Waltz</em>. It's hard to think of a single tribute album that's endured as more than a novelty, or functioned as anything more than a chance for a handful of contemporary artists to pay drooling homage to a musical hero, and, unfortunately, <em>Endless Highway</em> is no different.
    </p><p>
    The record opens with Guster (including, weirdly, Ray LaMontagne on harmonica) performing ""This Wheel's on Fire"", a track co-written by Dylan with bassist/guitarist Rick Danko. Despite some appropriately-jangly banjo strums, Guster's rendition is dopey and forgettable; Bruce Hornsby's slick, smarmy take on ""King Harvest"" is no more forgivable (to make things worse, Hornsby sounds like he's doing some kind of perverse Dave Matthews vocal impression). Gomez's skronky swipe at ""Up on Cripple Creek"" banks on preserving the hustle of the original; Jack Johnson's spare ""I Shall Be Released"" is stoic, if otherwise uninspired. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are a handful of compelling contributions: My Morning Jacket's ""It Makes No Difference"" (which was recorded, appropriately, at Levon Helm's studio in Woodstock) feels organic and raw, riddled with perfect guitar wankery and Jim James' otherworldly yowls. The Allman Brothers' live cover of ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" feels custom-made for their set; the Band has precious few actual ties to the American south (although Helm was born in Arkansas), and, unsurprisingly, the Allmans' Georgia wails suit the song-- which details the fall of Richmond to the Union Army-- preposterously well. Ben Gibbard's habit of cooing about arcane American spaces makes ""Rockin' Chair"" an oddly successful fit for Death Cab for Cutie, and their closing rendition is sweet and loose. But ultimately, even though <em>Endless Highway</em> is a noble effort, nothing here truly showcases the Band's songwriting any better than the Band itself, and the artists involved could do better work by just imploring their fans to pick up <em>The Band</em> or <em>Music From Big Pink</em>.

    When the Wu-Tang Clan first touched down nearly 15 years ago, they were the world's most dangerous geeks. Warped by PCP, touched by the microphone muses, and informed by the hyperbolic mysticism of kung-fu and a pro-black strain of Islam known as 5 Percent, the Staten Island crew blended menace and mythology-- the sort of hip-hop Joseph Campbell, Marcus Garvey, and Freeway Rick could all appreciate. But now that the allusions of novelty and youth have faded, and the once-feared Wu have been overshadowed by a long line of successors and pretenders, all that's left is the memories, the solo albums, and the ever-growing myth.  <br/></p><p>
    Though it's far from a great album, <em>Afro Samurai</em> fits in nicely with Wu folklore. The anime series it soundtracks resembles the animated segments in <em>Kill Bill</em> (which, of course, RZA also scored), while its main character, dubbed Afro, is everything the Wu always wanted to be:  stark and bloody, yet also strangely honorable.<br/></p><p>
    Initially, it seems like RZA's up for the challenge. On ""Just a Lil Dude"", the canned musical metaphor of a fluttering harp is smashed another RZA's signature minor-key tension. The tight acoustic guitar figure and smoky soul hook on ""Cameo Afro"" provide perfect background fodder for GZA's rhymes. ""Certified Samurai""'s chunky drums and stuttering rhythms make a striking counterpoint for Talib Kweli's high-pitched, pointed voice. And ""Take Sword, Pt. I"" is haughty Asian lowbrow-- in other words: vintage RZA.
    </p>
<p>
    The album's final five tracks find RZA again returning to his Bobby Digital persona. Unfortunately, the tracks are largely tossed off, closer in spirit to Bobby's blah sophomore album than his inventive debut.  The oddly tuned key line of ""Glorious Day"" is refreshingly strange, but RZA lazily opens the track with line recycled from his guest turn on GZA's ""Fam Members Only"". <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Another problem: The music feels too incidental and monotonous for the soundtrack to stand alone. The <em>Shaft</em>-sharking bass of ""Afro's Fight Father"" is slight and, by now, awfully trite, while the warmed-over trip-hop of ""Oh"" telegraphs a character's introspection with obvious emotional metaphors, lacking the momentum to ever fully get off the ground. Granted, this is a score, and its primary purpose is to set a mood and stay out of the way, but on record, it's rarely evocative or engaging. 
    </p>
<p>
    RZA could have stood to have taken a cue from Madlib (or even the first batch of Wu-Tang albums) and attempted to meld the elements into a pastiche. There is, after all,  a central narrative and enough parallel musical strains for this to work. Either way, the Abbot's brilliance, apparent here only in flashes, may be enough to sustain long-time fans holding out hope for the anticipated Wu-Tang resurrection, but otherwise, the soundtrack's hit or miss.

    Only in the flipbook-genre environment of modern music could it be
    possible for the recent resurgence of dancepunk, 2003's king indie
    trend, to be considered a revival. But with a run of surprisingly solid
    follow-up albums from the Rapture, LCD Soundsystem, and !!! and an
    infusion of new blood from the European new-rave scene (ignoring the
    fact that the sound is neither ""new"" nor ""rave""), the beats vs. jagged-guitar formula appears to be wriggling
    free from the backlash. It remains to be
    seen whether the second time around this decade is going to be any more
    sustainable than the first fling, but one critical strategic move will
    certainly help the effort: This time, they're inviting girls.</p><p>
    It wasn't really remarked upon at the time, but dancepunk's first
    wave ended up looking in retrospect like quite the sausage party. Newer acts Crystal Castles and Revl9n are already remedying this
    omission, but the best double-X chromosome entry thus far is the quick
    self-titled EP from New Young Pony Club, the London band that features-- get this-- <em>three actual girls!</em>
    Their first single ""Ice Cream"", already a CNN morning-show banger
    thanks to a (no fault of NYPC) particularly irritating Intel campaign,
    immediately draws attention to this closing gender gap, allowing
    basically the same combination of elements to sound fresh all over
    again.</p><p>
    You see, for all of dancepunk's club-music aspirations, it may have
    failed by whiffing on the most frequent topic of dance-music
    discussion: sex. It's no surprise that a scene dominated by
    heterosexual men would rather spend its time talking about politics or
    record collections or (ick) music criticism rather than getting it on;
    in fact, this impotency is probably as defining an ""indie""
    characteristic as fuzzy guitars. Putting gender politics aside to avoid
    taxing my word limit, the infusion of women into the scene will likely
    serve to put the sensuality back into the sound, a feat handily carried
    out by ""Ice Cream"", which saucily treats intercourse like a
    make-your-own-sundae bar. With a strangely accented voice that's part
    Flying Lizards and part Debbie Harry rapping, Tahita Bulmer is welcome
    respite from the lecture-singing that has dominated the genre's formula
    thus far.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, adult content doesn't fully explain the appeal of New
    Young Pony Club. Like a lot of their second-wave brethren, NYPC sound
    less like a punk band dabbling in synthesizers and hi-hat than a dance
    act employing rock tropes when appropriate, adding danger and
    sloppiness to shake some life into the programming. ""Get Dancey"" hits
    this balance perfectly, with drums that stroll the border between live
    and looped, and jagged guitar deployed in punchy bursts. The unrelenting
    beat of ""Descend"" is even blueprinted more like a club track than a
    rock song; there are no verse-chorus peaks and valleys, just a marching
    groove that doesn't quit while Bulmer rotates through meaningless
    mantras.
    </p>
<p>
    These are the kind of dance-music maneuvers that most dancepunk
    groups rely on remixers to summon, so it's to New Young Pony Club's
    credit that their originals preempt any easy disco-edit makeover. The
    three remixes of ""Ice Cream"" included here are therefore allowed to go
    to more interesting places, though the Comets remix is content to
    merely amplify the shimmery keyboards, while Van She's turn imagines a
    DFA1979 cover version. Only DJ Mehdi's remix, which takes the Flying
    Lizards connection a bit too literally in settling for presets and slot
    machines, is able to ice down the original's intensity to any degree,
    but for the most part ""Ice Cream"" proves hardy enough to survive the
    reconstruction derby.
    </p>
<p>
    Few songs are good enough to turn up four times on a six-song record
    though, and the half-original/half-remix structure of this EP keeps it
    grounded as little more than a teaser-trailer for things to come. As
    such, it may also be deceptive; scores of dance-punk bands in the early aughts were able to stir up buzz with one or two hot tracks, but most couldn't sustain that excitement over a full-length or a subsequent
    single. Fortunately, this EP suggests New Young Pony Club can tweak the
    formula just enough that they may have found a way out of the
    patriarchal post-punk/mutant-disco retread rut, a development that
    could make 2007 less a revival and 2003 more of a prelim.

This past summer the city set aside about 500 grand for a new slogan designed to get tourists to blow their vacation time (and money) at unique hot spots like the P.F. Chang's in the Inner Harbor, only to come up with ""Get in on It"", the kind of so-sad-it's-funny boner a junior ad exec could scribble on a cocktail napkin between lines of coke. Meanwhile, junkies were purportedly knocking down lampposts in order to sell them for scrap. (And you thought that was just <em>The Wire</em> writers being clever.) Still, that's the kind of cosmically ROFL-icious juxtaposition that keeps me here. (Philly came up with ""Philly's More Fun When You Sleep Over"", which, while sad, isn't quite sad in the same way. Also, my hometown junkies aren't quite as ingenious or industrious.)</p><p>
    The other thing that keeps me here is the music scene. When out-of-town friends ask what's going on here, the best I can fumble is ""well, we have a really strong urban scene... and a lot of weirdos."" But please do not read ""weirdos"" as an insult. It's the weirdos that make life worth living. One of the last times I saw Human Host, a rather burly fellow-- not a member of the band-- was so moved by the music, one assumes, that he proceeded to strip down to his sweaty underpants and bore through the slack-jawed crowd like a pale, hairy bull. Eventually his clothes had to be retrieved from the loft's overhead pipes. The band continued to declaim their cryptic vocals and punch at their creaking synthesizers, lost in the music, neither emboldened nor disturbed by the jiggling manflesh. Or, as a coworker once put it, ""sometimes you see them and it's like <em>oh my god</em> and other times you see them and it's like <em>what the fuck?</em>""</p><p>
    If, however, you need a more concrete musical comparison, the ol' rock critical ""this meets that"" thing, then for <em>Exploding Demon</em>'s best track think Excepter. On the long, hypnotic ""Alien Fire/Birth Cycle"", recorded live, the Host shares the Brooklyn band's love for the psychedelic qualities of lots of echo and reverb, vocals buried in the mix until they're another undulating component of the overall swaying noise, and the kind of in-the-moment mixology that hazily blurs one section of a song into the next, like sitting in the driveway after an overnight drive and your tired-ass mind not quite being able to remember how you actually managed to get back home. The track begins as a slow, distorted keyboard drone, anguished screams drawn out into low moans and mumbles. It ends, broken up only by a brief burst of applause, nearly 14 minutes later with a drum machine that sounds like a xylophone, some eldritch organ notes, and stoner guitar peals floating through the air like we're reclining on the set of a throw-rug strewn drug den in an exploitation flick from Turkey circa 1974.
    </p><p>
    Pretty awesome. Except nothing else here sounds remotely like ""Alien Fire/Birth Cycle""; <em>Exploding Demon</em> is Human Host's attempt to give you everything you might get at one of their random function live shows, the oh my god/what the fuck? factor without the dudes in tighty whiteys. Tracks like ""The Tomb of Science"" are a bit like Men's Recovery Project in their <em>Bolides Over Basra</em> ""concept"" phase: farty karaoke keyboards, preset beats, and warbled lyrics like ""Crust of the ism/ Plucked off trembling cocks/ The alert thumping flesh makes machine pits ripe."" Purposefully ""fucked up"" but not obnoxious with it. ""Six Realms"" and ""Demonic Remnants"", on the other hand, are almost traditional guitar-bass-drums rock songs, with slow, sagging bass parts and grinding guitars; the latter's dank, manhole atmosphere and trudging drums sound a bit a like the Dead C at their forlorn best. The Host are doing something unique and at the same time very Baltimore, where they're just one of a few dozen bands pursuing some personal idiomatic weirdness. We could still do with a reduction in the murder rate, but there are worse places to live than one where idiosyncrasy is the rule.

    three tracks-- ""Return of the Native"", ""Silent Tents"", and ""Hymn Beneath the
    Palisades"". Given all the fuss-- a 38-minute album drawn from an
    eight-minute song-- the original ""Offshore"" must be pretty remarkable, right?</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Wrong. ""Offshore"" runs much like a multi-movement score for
    a short film about personal travails, writ large through a nature metaphor. The
    song's central image is a storm-swept New Orleans marsh-- ""Her presence
    and her delta eyes/ Stained-glass misery""--  representing loneliness and despair.
    It's sinister, subdural post-rock that builds slowly, eventually rising through
    glistening strings before launching upward. At its peak, though, is an awkward,
    three-minute, monoriff-and-variation coda. ""Offshore"" has been a live Miners
    favorite for years, and one suspects that on stage it unravels, explodes
    even. But, on record, it's aggressively passive, a ""big song"" with epic
    intentions and minimal effects.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The problems with the album-length adaptation are as similar
    as they are immediate: Instrumental opener ""Land of Pale Saints"" feels a lot
    like treading water, frontman Daniel Burton and his big band (including members
    of Windsor for the Derby, Unwed Sailor, and On Fillmore) trudging along with one
    riff. Any variation is essentially rhythmic, save for one guitar that comes in
    late, out of phase and in another octave. It's one of the record's most
    interesting textures, but-- just when it starts to threaten the pattern-- it falls
    away, leaving the drums to march through ethereal, paint-by-pedals tones. The
    pop songs that follow are charming and intricate, like Broken Social Scene's
    most challenging pieces. But, by then, any momentum is nullified, and the
    doldrums barely stir the sea.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    For Early Day Miners, this situation isn't unique: It's been
    the source of both their most listless and most winning moments, and it was the
    snag that kept Burton's former band, Ativin (also from Indiana, also on
    Secretly Canadian), so stale. Over four albums, Ativin became progressively
    better at finding the next level and retreating from it, stopping short of
    post-rock fireworks, always falling into a safety net of barely agitated
    affability. When Ativin got loud, as on 2004's ""Scout"", an awkward
    self-awareness made them cut their losses and mitigate the aggression. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    It was as frustrating then as it is now. When Black
    Mountain's Amber Webber moans the lyrics of ""Return of the Native""-- barely there
    above a bed of slow-trot drums, tremolo guitars, and mild distortion-- you want
    everyone to speak up about what is happening. But it moves in reverse,
    tip-toeing into ""Silent Tents"" and dissolving into a three-minute drone. Icy
    comfort, not hard-won redemption. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But it's not over: ""Hymn Beneath the Palisades"" slowly
    eclipses the drone and, finally, pummels it. Guitars and tom blasts suck the
    air from their surroundings. Maybe this is it, the moment when it all comes
    crashing forward, the release. But the band stiffens like lockjaw, serial
    repetition driving little but boredom home. As conclusions go, it's perfect.
    Unflinching, it refuses to move, the quintessential capitulation of an
    emotional post-rock album that allows no room for empathy, attachment or
    growth. Trouble is, one track's success is contingent on a matrix otherwise
    built on failure.

What to think of the horrific, scatological <i>Onanie Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols</i> or <i>Soul Discharge</i>? They were punk, sound art, DIY, and careless. Like all the best things in life, they were initially loud and annoying. They made music whose only Western counterparts were brainy NYC noise     artistes like John Zorn, DNA, and Sonic Youth, yet their viewpoint     sounded more akin to a two-year-old dropping paint on a guitar and     eating hardcore pornography. It was ""influential,"" in the     same way a tornado is influential on surrounding weather patterns     (while paradoxically being completely dependent on them), but the band-- from Osaka, physically isolated from more celebrated Japanese     artistic culture in Tokyo-- has never operated within any scene to     which you could attach it. At the dawn of the 90s, Boredoms were as disagreeable as they came.</p>
<p>And then something strange happened: Year by year, EP by EP, they turned into millennium messiahs. Their     music went from abstract expression, hundreds of vectors shooting out     from the edges of their graffiti-mural songs, to hyper-rotating flashes     of light, warmth and the kind of glorious, single-minded pound I     associate with trance-induced cults and massive religious awakenings. Drums were everywhere, momentum was everything, from the thunderous, flailing fire music of <i>Super Roots 5</i> (1995) to 1997's heavenly motorik'd <i>Super Roots 7</i> to what, as I hear it, is one of the most perfectly realized rock records ever released, <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i> (1999). For     all the music critics and Musicology Ph.D's proclaiming the invalidity     of clear linear progression in the arts, Boredoms' one way ticket to the     sun in the last decade tricks matters up a bit.</p>
<p>Then, they disappeared. Boredoms morphed into the drum-circle outfit V∞redoms     after guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto and bassist Hira left the band in 1999-- allegedly, in Yamamoto's estimation, after they'd played the most     perfect music they could ever play. It's hard to argue with him. Vice's reissue of the <i>Super Roots</i> series documents a band on a mission, whether or not they planned anything in advance. These     records, spanning 1993 through 1999, many of which were never issued     outside of Japan, are not only a decent summary of Boredoms' music     (though I'd check <i>Pop Tatari</i> and <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i> first for the apex of their early sound), but are also inspiring examples     of how a few people, playing music particular to almost nobody but     themselves, can represent the upward movement of not only their     culture, but the world at large. And yes, a lot of     hippies thought the same thing about themselves-- indeed, opponents of     90s Bore-volution have called out the later stuff as ""hippy music""--     but especially in light of the snowballing speed of information at the     time, I'm hard pressed to find better period reps than Eye, Yoshimi, and     company.</p>
<p>The original <i>Super Roots</i> EP from 1993 (94 in the U.S.) is the only one of the series-- excluding the super-limited, still non-reissued <i>Super Roots 2</i> mini-CD that originally came with Japanese versions of <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i>-- that bears much relation to the ""regular"" studio records Boredoms released concurrently. In     this case, that means the music is all over the place: ""Pop Kiss""     begins with a triple count-off (""1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4!"") to     precisely not much. Yoshimi's wah'd trumpet, Yamamoto's     quietly rising, staccato guitar and what sounds like someone kissing     the mic form a perfectly Bore introduction to the record, albeit kind     of like getting a damp cloth when you're expecting fireworks. ""Budôkan     Tape Try (500 Tapes High)"" rocks it up a bit as primitive dub-sludge-- in fact, much of the record takes on a tribal ambience with     pitter-patter percussion and the feeling that all of this is happening     amongst island natives cooped up in a studio on their one foray into     the city.</p>
<p>The     showstopper on the American version of the EP was ""Chocolate Out"",     comprised of eight mini-""songs"", including ""Pitch at Bunch on Itch""     (day 3 guitar lesson rock riff + Eye hitting shit with a stick and     screaming), ""Machine 3"" (yell-rock + day 6 punk lesson riffs +     proto-""Acid Police"" call and response screaming), ""Ear?Wig?Web?""     (forecasting the tropical noises they'd make in a few years) and ""Super     Frake ∞9"" (sounding like a chant I'd expect to open a V∞redoms show). As a coherent statement, <i>Super Roots</i> isn't. As a Boredoms product from the time, it's more than typical.</p>
<p>Things started getting interesting (as in more so than hitting-shit-with-a-stick interesting) with <i>Super Roots 3</i> from 1994. Consisting of a single track, the half-hour, perfectly named ""Hard Trance Away (Karaoke of the Cosmos)"" was a straightforward fusion of hardcore punk and purity through repetition. Perhaps     Eye got the idea from his heroes Bad Brains, who while never playing     any 30-minute hardcore jams, did suggest the possibility that cosmic     enlightenment and violent pummeling via riffs and beats were by no     means mutually exclusive. With the benefit of hindsight, <i>SR3</i> looks like an obvious sign of things to come, though to my ears, it     sounds larval compared to the full-grown heaven crashing on <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i> and <i>Super æ</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,     this is pretty relentless stuff; speedbeat and two-chord riffing are     the order of the tune, and in fact that two-chord pattern doesn't even     change until almost five-and-a-half minutes in. It     changes again at 9:32, and again a couple of minutes later-- if that     sounds like slow torture, take solace in the fact that were you     experiencing this live, you'd probably need an IV before the song was     half done. The entire track is instrumental except for     brief intro and outro screams before everything comes to a sudden halt,     ending with two minutes of silence. I'd call it the calm after one storm, and before another (on the next record), but that's bad poetry where <i>SR3</i> is just hard and fast.</p>
<p>So, things started getting <i>really </i>interesting-- as in more so than cosmically enlightened-speadbeat interesting-- on 1995's <i>Super Roots 5 </i>(there     was no fourth part of the series, due either to copyright issues or     Japanese superstition regarding the number ""4,"" depending on whom you     talk to), arguably the most single-minded, impenetrable thing Boredoms     ever released. But wait! That doesn't     necessarily mean it's cacophonous noise (even though it is) or that you     won't be able to make it all the way through. Rather than     use punk as a conduit to universal truth, this time the band used     shimmering, undiluted rock noise: oceans of distorted guitar waves that     suggested some kind of meta-sonic, universal harmony pummeling ears     like a sonic tsunami, and what sounded like an army of cymbalists. Over     the course of 64 minutes, drummers Yoshimi and ATR provide nothing like     a pulse; rather, sheer, piercing power via the resonant roar of their     metal discs and battered sticks. Indeed, the track-- entitled ""GO!!!!!"", after Eye's imperative about five minutes in-- is a     fairly literal, if monolithic mapping of a tidal wave, and though I'm     tempted to award the band a million points for ungodly persistence, I     can't say it's the easiest listen in the world. (Though in fairness, there are a few Bore freaks out there that think this is the best thing they ever did.) In any case, <i>Super Roots 5</i> gave ample warning of the kind of nuclear release Boredoms were capable     of, and in retrospect, perhaps they had to go there in order to prepare     themselves for the more angelic fury of <i>Super æ</i> and <i>VCN</i>.</p>
<p>Boredoms     arrived at the midpoint of the 90s in the most dissonant, unresolved     way possible, which, given the exquisite, anarchic resolve of their     final records, seems almost too perfectly scripted. The     music they made afterwards took all the sounds approached to that     point, and channeled them into sounds that, to go with Yamamoto's     suggestion, left very little room for improvement. Stay tuned for the next exciting Bore chapter (i.e., Vice's reissues of <i>Super Roots 6</i>, <i>7</i> and <i>8</i>) for maximum, beautiful noise and other natural disasters.

What to think of the horrific, scatological <i>Onanie Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols</i> or <i>Soul Discharge</i>? They were punk, sound art, DIY, and careless. Like all the best things in life, they were initially loud and annoying. They made music whose only Western counterparts were brainy NYC noise     artistes like John Zorn, DNA, and Sonic Youth, yet their viewpoint     sounded more akin to a two-year-old dropping paint on a guitar and     eating hardcore pornography. It was ""influential,"" in the     same way a tornado is influential on surrounding weather patterns     (while paradoxically being completely dependent on them), but the band-- from Osaka, physically isolated from more celebrated Japanese     artistic culture in Tokyo-- has never operated within any scene to     which you could attach it. At the dawn of the 90s, Boredoms were as disagreeable as they came.</p>
<p>And then something strange happened: Year by year, EP by EP, they turned into millennium messiahs. Their     music went from abstract expression, hundreds of vectors shooting out     from the edges of their graffiti-mural songs, to hyper-rotating flashes     of light, warmth and the kind of glorious, single-minded pound I     associate with trance-induced cults and massive religious awakenings. Drums were everywhere, momentum was everything, from the thunderous, flailing fire music of <i>Super Roots 5</i> (1995) to 1997's heavenly motorik'd <i>Super Roots 7</i> to what, as I hear it, is one of the most perfectly realized rock records ever released, <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i> (1999). For     all the music critics and Musicology Ph.D's proclaiming the invalidity     of clear linear progression in the arts, Boredoms' one way ticket to the     sun in the last decade tricks matters up a bit.</p>
<p>Then, they disappeared. Boredoms morphed into the drum-circle outfit V∞redoms     after guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto and bassist Hira left the band in 1999-- allegedly, in Yamamoto's estimation, after they'd played the most     perfect music they could ever play. It's hard to argue with him. Vice's reissue of the <i>Super Roots</i> series documents a band on a mission, whether or not they planned anything in advance. These     records, spanning 1993 through 1999, many of which were never issued     outside of Japan, are not only a decent summary of Boredoms' music     (though I'd check <i>Pop Tatari</i> and <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i> first for the apex of their early sound), but are also inspiring examples     of how a few people, playing music particular to almost nobody but     themselves, can represent the upward movement of not only their     culture, but the world at large. And yes, a lot of     hippies thought the same thing about themselves-- indeed, opponents of     90s Bore-volution have called out the later stuff as ""hippy music""--     but especially in light of the snowballing speed of information at the     time, I'm hard pressed to find better period reps than Eye, Yoshimi, and     company.</p>
<p>The original <i>Super Roots</i> EP from 1993 (94 in the U.S.) is the only one of the series-- excluding the super-limited, still non-reissued <i>Super Roots 2</i> mini-CD that originally came with Japanese versions of <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i>-- that bears much relation to the ""regular"" studio records Boredoms released concurrently. In     this case, that means the music is all over the place: ""Pop Kiss""     begins with a triple count-off (""1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4!"") to     precisely not much. Yoshimi's wah'd trumpet, Yamamoto's     quietly rising, staccato guitar and what sounds like someone kissing     the mic form a perfectly Bore introduction to the record, albeit kind     of like getting a damp cloth when you're expecting fireworks. ""Budôkan     Tape Try (500 Tapes High)"" rocks it up a bit as primitive dub-sludge-- in fact, much of the record takes on a tribal ambience with     pitter-patter percussion and the feeling that all of this is happening     amongst island natives cooped up in a studio on their one foray into     the city.</p>
<p>The     showstopper on the American version of the EP was ""Chocolate Out"",     comprised of eight mini-""songs"", including ""Pitch at Bunch on Itch""     (day 3 guitar lesson rock riff + Eye hitting shit with a stick and     screaming), ""Machine 3"" (yell-rock + day 6 punk lesson riffs +     proto-""Acid Police"" call and response screaming), ""Ear?Wig?Web?""     (forecasting the tropical noises they'd make in a few years) and ""Super     Frake ∞9"" (sounding like a chant I'd expect to open a V∞redoms show). As a coherent statement, <i>Super Roots</i> isn't. As a Boredoms product from the time, it's more than typical.</p>

    ""Kill Your Employer"", where, after several patch-ins and ad-libs, you
    hear the following muffled aside over a doorknocker
    beat: ""I don't join the ranks of ordinary men/ I burn flags, not oil
    reserves/ I'm no ex-football player Iraqi combatant... who the fuck you
    think you're talking to? It's me...""</p><p>
    Well, no shit. No one's going to mistake that
    Cheshire-cat-on-Ritalin voice, no matter how much Busdriver may slow
    down and variate his flow. However, <em>RoadKillOvercoat</em>
    may be as far outside Busdriver's comfort zone as he can get: a slower,
    weirder, and less complacent record than he's ever done. DJ's Nobody
    and Boom Bip provide beats that draw from a wider range of styles and
    flirt with an alien, psychedelic edge, giving Busdriver enough room to
    be as weird as he wants to be. Tracks like ""Secret Skin"" could be the
    soundtrack to a fantasy-gorged Skittles commercial with its horse-clop
    drums and citrus-acid guitars, and closer ""Dream Catcher's Mitt"" is a
    campfire strum loaded with unusually saccharine verbosity from
    Busdriver. No more jazz-flute samples, no more backpacker aftertaste.</p><p>
    Can we blame him, though? 2005's <em>Fear of a Black Tangent</em>
    merged highly accessible beats with some of his sharpest and most
    sardonic observations, mostly on himself and his place in the
    marketplace. Critics who didn't get the joke suggested Busdriver didn't
    either, that he was bitter and lashing out. With that album he
    focused, and it didn't really pay off. Now, rather than bemoan his
    standing, he's actually trying to change it. Busdriver is no longer
    comfortable among the young intelligentsia, and he's even turned to
    bite the hands that've fed him in the disc's two <em>pieces de resistance</em>,
    ""Kill Your Employer"" and ""Sun Shower"", the latter sniping at sheltered
    art school attendees.
    </p><p>
    Drawing the listener in with a current, edgy beat just to smack them
    with a near-psychedelic chorus and a near-impenetrable lyric (""Post
    recreational paranoia is the sport of now"") is a mischievous trick on
    ""Employer"", and the track for ""Sun Showers"" is more ominous,
    atmospheric rock than rap. But while ""Sun Shower"" is terribly catchy and uncompromising, Busdriver sounds awkward
    over it. More than that, his targets here seem ill-defined, and lyrics
    that might work as (and should be) throwaways hog attention:
    ""well-pruned yuppie scum,"" spoiled ""art-school kids"" and other hapless
    bourgeoisie in ""Sun Shower"", or kids ""smearing salad on [their] SUV""
    and the aforementioned ""ex-football playing Iraqi combatants"" in ""Kill
    Your Employer"". These criticisms are a little too easy, especially
    coming from a guy who's displayed more subtlety and wit when
    freestyling at a drive-thru window. Busdriver is smarter than this. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not that <em>RoadKillOvercoat</em> is a complete 180-- opener
    ""Casting Agents and Callgirls"" crams hooks like last-minute travelers
    stuffing a suitcase, but follower ""Less Yes's, More No's"" could have fit
    comfortably on <em>Black Tangent</em> with its scraping stun-gun beat,
    and the latter half of the disc returns to more sparse beats and rap
    aerobatics of his earlier career with tracks like ""Pompous Posies! Your
    Party's No Fun"" or ""(Bloody Paw on the) Kill Floor"". And there are
    other moments where he fits just fine in new contexts: The sugary
    sampling of ""The Troglodyte Wins"" is poppy but bare, and his delivery
    is what sells it, sounding like he's dancing among the new drapes when
    he's actually skewering America's current head of state. Then there's
    ""Mr. Mistake (Bested by the Whisper Chasm)"", a more introspective and
    intimate song where Busdriver lowers his tone to a multi-tracked
    monotone whisper. It's a highly effective curveball that's still pretty
    pop, and proves Busdriver could have broke new ground without
    stretching himself to the extent he has here.
    </p>
<p>
    I wouldn't fault an underground <em>wunderkind</em> for pushing himself out
    of his comfort zone, and there's only a few moments overall where
    Busdriver's a square peg in a round hole (it's just a shame those
    moments are the album's centerpieces). It sounds like a guy who doesn't
    want to be at a party, but grimaces and turns up the charm-- to
    paraphrase an old Dismemberment Plan lyric, he sounds like himself, but more so.
    Maybe some thought Busdriver sounded self-satisfied before, but he used

    stumbled upon Pavement 7""'s and then, just as importantly, located
    the impossibly varied, amazing bands coming out of New Zealand.</p><p>
    Summer job dollars spent, records labeled Xpressway, Feel Good All
    Over, Flying Nun, and Siltbreeze arrived on the doorstep containing
    music by everyone from Alastair Galbraith to Wreck Small Speakers on
    Expensive Stereos. Each had its place in my nascent view of the
    country, but the holy NZ trilogy consisted of the Jefferies brothers
    (Peter and Graeme), Chris Knox, and the Dead C (and their various
    permutations).</p><p>
    The Dead C should go first: Michael Morley, Bruce Russell, and
    Robbie Yeats' ramshackle, half-speed, and scary racket externalized
    what was teeming inside my head. (Tellingly, favorites were <em>DR 503</em>, <em>Eusa Kills</em>, <em>White House</em>, <em>Trapdoor Fucking Exit</em>, <em>Harsh 70s Reality</em>, and <em>The Operation of the Sonne</em>.)
    Really, I've probably mentioned the band in more reviews than any
    other group, excepting the Sun City Girls. That critical
    shorthand could strip references to the trio of all nuance, but
    each time I've name-dropped, I hear ""Max Harris"" or ""Power"" and
    remember exactly the way they fucked with my conceptions.
    </p><p>
    As a testament to that fandom, I own all the individual albums,
    singles, magazine editions, and the like collected on the two discs
    that make up <em>Vain, Erudite, and Stupid: Selected Works 1987-2005</em>.
    Some of my favorites are here, some aren't; it seems like a waste of
    time to harp. In fact, the band selected the songs-- so, no matter the
    ostensible gaps, it's fascinating. Founding member Bruce Russell also penned notes and diaristic reminiscences for each
    track-- he speaks of process, instrumentation, the
    weather. (You can also read opaque and anecdotal reminiscences from <em>Bananafish</em> editor Seymour Glass, Siltbreeze founder Tom Lax, and <em>The Wire</em> scribe Nick Cain.)
    </p>
<p>
    I bought the vast output as it was released, but experiencing
    it again as a sort of time-lapse listening experience is incredible. You can trace
    a history and see overlaps, divergences from the slow-mo bedroom psychedelia of
    ""Max Harris"" to the warping, snare-scuffling Throbbing Gristle swarm of ""Maggot"",
    punctuated by Morley's shrieking, monstrous taunts. Tracks and
    fragments jump from chattering ambiance to real-time collage to spoken
    Mark E. Smith phaser shifts to scrawling handfuls of dust-- songs cut
    or continue unexpectedly; some soar from the trash heap, as is the case
    on the almost 11-minute ""Helen Said This"".</p><p>
    Haven't heard the band? The sound's difficult to describe. One thing: Nothing is ever aurally spiky or sharp-- every feedback twang's draped
    in this weird NZ dew. They eke the loveliest distortion tones from
    guitars and tape echo, and much occurs on the spot: They're amazing
    improvisers, upchucking <em>Twin Infinitives</em>-sized
    messes at will. It's garage rock, maybe, but the garage is burning
    down and you're in no rush to escape. For me, the mournful stuff's the
    best; and when they're tapping sounds from a ham radio, giving
    themselves the space to open entirely as on the slow burn of ""The
    Marriage of Reason and Squalor"" and its sci-fi Shadow Ring weirdness.
    The rarely just rock-- well, but what about ""Bitcher""?-- and even then
    there's almost always some kind of swerve.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    Praise singing complete, I hadn't really listened to much of the band's
    most recent output. The last couple of songs on disc two, from 2001 and
    2003, respectively, find the band getting more spiraled and ""tight.""
    See, they started using laptops a bit and, bubble popped, my interest
    waned. That's a minor purist gripe, though-- the approach remains
    impressively aggressive even if the ambiance is partially lost. Plus,
    it's interesting to see just how cohesive the practice largely remains
    over twenty-something years (distilled into this two-plus hours).
    </p>
<p>
    Sure, collections are never complete and you can't replicate
    discovery, but damn if this fucker doesn't seem plenty full. Until
    someone does a <em>Please Kill Me</em> for the period I alluded to at the get
    go, documents like this (and back issues of <em>Forced Exposure</em>) are
    our aural/oral history books and lessons: <em>Vain, Erudite, and Stupid </em>feels extremely primary.

Guitar
    bands playing sorta catchy hooks at sorta fast tempos abound, most hewing
    closely to the same styles and structures. Occasionally
    you get a Cheap Trick, Big Star, <em>Fight
    Songs</em>-era Old 97s, or early-90s Matthew Sweet, artists who take to the form
    like a birthright. But they're usually the exceptions. So why do the Broken
    West, a five-piece hailing from Los Angeles,
    sound so distinctive even when they don't sound new or necessarily unique?
    Their influences are all immediately recognizable and their songs all hummably
    predictable, and yet their Merge debut, <em>I
    Can't Go On, I'll Go On,</em> reveals the band to be confidently inventive and
    assured in their collective identity (nevermind that they had to change the
    band name just months before the release of this album).</p><p>
    I've been parsing this question ever since the review copy
    of <em>I Can't Go On</em> showed up on my
    doorstep late last year, and I finally found the answer when, out of sheer
    coincidence, I took a last-minute trip to Los Angeles, a place I've been
    fascinated with since reading Joan Didion's <em>The
    White Album</em> in college but had never managed to visit. On the return flight,
    as soon as I heard the chiming intro to ""On the Bubble"", I was transported
    right back to that Los Feliz apartment veranda, sipping a vodka and vitamin
    water, shooting the breeze with friends, and listening to the noise of the city
    as it sprawled in all directions around me. The strongest and most inviting
    aspect of <em>I Can't Go On</em> is its sense
    of place, effortlessly depicted but surprisingly specific. These songs evoke
    sunny skies, scrubbrush canyons, bad traffic, palm trees, and half-recognized
    minor celebrities.</p><p>
    Rather than patterning themselves on one or two particular
    artists, the Broken West draw on past local scenes to strengthen those
    evocations without being obvious. The handclap hopscotch rhythms and bright
    guitar sound on ""Slow"" and the airy vocals and blocky keyboards on ""Shiftee""
    recall the pop scene of the late 60s, while the songs like ""Abigail"" and ""Baby
    on My Arm"", with their strummy moods, evoke the Laurel Canyon scene of the 70s
    and the 80s Paisley Underground. And I swear I hear a little 80s Sunset Strip
    hair metal in some of the guitars, but I might be dreaming.
    </p><p>
    Occasionally the Broken West root themselves too deeply in
    the city's past, and <em>I Can't Go On</em>
    threatens to become an exercise in historical re-creation. But that sense of
    being stuck in the past is never pervasive: Despite a few stumbles (the melody
    on ""Brass Ring"" never resolves itself satisfactorily, and closer ""Like a Light""
    lacks the airtight structure of previous songs), the band transcends base
    nostalgia. They compensate for their somewhat geeky obsessiveness with
    confident songwriting, inventive arrangements, and <em>verite</em> production that emphasizes the band's breakneck live energy,
    especially on ""On the Bubble"" and ""Hale Sunrise"". Best of all is ""Down in the
    Valley"", resurrected from their equally strong EP <em>The Dutchman's Gold</em>, which they self-released in 2004 when the band was still know as the Brokedown. It's a solid
    four minutes of churning guitars, fizzy harmonies, and insanely catchy
    melodies, anchored by a chorus that simultaneously plays into the city's
    good-time vibe while slyly undercutting it: ""Sun down, blood horizon, now it
    feels all right/ No one feels the darkness down in the valley tonight.""
    </p>
<p>
    Despite their California
    origins, the Broken West aren't pioneers staking out new territory. Like L.A.
    County, the terrain has been well
    walked for years. And yet, I'd rather hang out in their familiar L.A.
    than in the Thrills' fantasy city, the Chili Peppers' rich-boy funk metropolis,
    or Jane's Addiction's romanticized junkie playground. And maybe they don't even
    represent the real L.A. past or
    present (and how could they with no Compton
    beats or Western swing?), but simply the L.A.
    of our collective imagination.

    Too often indie-rock remix albums collections take
    on a tone of self-indulgence, coming off like a boast about the group's
    open-minded listening habits, a way of announcing that they're down
    with the new-fangled electronic music, or at least friends with such
    people. At best, a remix record can bring out hidden details and
    motivations in the source material, like Death from Above 1979 being
    forcibly dragged out of the dance-music closet with their <em>Romance
    Bloody Romance</em>. At worst, these albums can make the remixers
    appear to be a clutch of shady plastic surgeons, talking the remixee
    into unnecessary procedures that do nothing but strip them of their
    unique features.</p><p>
    Architecture in Helsinki are not novices to the musical cosmetic
    surgery world, having included at least one remix on each of their
    singles/EPs to date, surprisingly few of which are rehashed for <em>We Died, They Remixed</em>.
    Yet the results aren't much improved by their experience going under
    the knife, recruiting an uneven roster of nip/tuckers who rarely go
    beyond the typical by-the-numbers computerization of selections from
    2005's <em>In Case We Die</em>. To mix medical metaphors, most of these
    clinicians can't resist the urge to force-feed the normally spastic AiH
    a handful of Ritalin, icing down the tempo and Mr. Toad turns and
    leaving a slack-jawed, zoned-out zombie.</p><p>
    But let's start with the exceptions. Discopunkers 33Hz hang the accoutrements of disco-- robot voices, some whispered
    call-and-response, rubber-band bass, choked guitars-- on the giddy
    ""It's 5!"" and actually pull off the revamp, the new environment
    transforming the group's collective yelp into an almost-believable cool
    detachment. There's also a bit of an indie-dance rumble between Safety
    Scissors and Hot Chip over who can do a better job with ""Do the
    Whirlwind"", a fight won by the minimal squiggles and micro-percussion
    deployed by Safety Scissors... plus, Hot Chip was disqualified due to
    bongo usage.
    </p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, on the other 14 remixes, Architecture in
    Helsinki's fun-house arrangements are neutralized by the restrictive
    pace of the click track, which neatly tailors all the ragged edges that make them so
    infectious on their own. When the band's vocals aren't
    minced into near-vapor (as on DAT Politics' ""Frenchy I'm Faking"") or
    routed through a Speak &amp; Spell (Franc Tetas' ""Wishbone""), they're
    left uncomfortably bare, a throat-straining enthusiasm that sounds out
    of place amidst the precision and sheen. Outright replacing the vocals
    doesn't work either, as Mocky's ridiculous rap-along version of ""Need
    to Shout"" proves in horrifying fashion (actual couplet ""I need to
    shout, what's it all about."").
    </p>
<p>
    Missing the point even further are the trio of downbeat atmospheric
    makeovers tucked into the end of the disc, by Qua, Mountains in the
    Sky, and Isan. Qua's vaguely middle-eastern ""Maybe You Can Own Me""
    turns the epic twee-duet original into an Enigma outtake, while
    Mountains in the Sky reorganizes the components of <em>In Case We Die</em>'s
    all-stops finale ""What's In Store?"" into a lump of dull looping-program
    Muzak, apparently not trusting the original's peaks and valleys. Morr
    Musicians Isan at least give themselves a challenge with the throwaway
    organ transition ""Rendezvous: Portrero Hill"", but the end product never
    gets beyond sounding like a watered-down Múm.
    </p>
<p>
    The problem with most of these figurative nose jobs is a
    misunderstanding of Architecture in Helsinki's original appeal. They're
    a band whose charm is built on their exuberance, their
    everything-but-the-kitchen-sink instrumentation, their willingness to
    wear hearts on sleeves to occasionally showtune proportions. Hearing
    one's art reinterpreted through the aesthetic of a colleague is
    presumably thrilling to a musician-- they've dwelled over the original
    so long through the recording and gigging process that a new context is
    welcome fresh air. But for fans hearing a gaggle of artists
    confronting the original songs only tangentially, or merely stripping
    them for parts and recycling them through their own uncompromised
    aesthetic is something of a bait and switch, a remix album as
    compilation rather than expansion.

    (and derided) time and again as indie rock meets Balkan brass, authenticity
    becomes an issue in just about every Beirut review. Whether labeled
    ""Gypsy Rock,"" Neutral Milk Hotel Jr., or flat-out village pillaging,
    Zach Condon's approach to songwriting's been questioned: Yup, the 20-year-old is from New Mexico and currently lives in New York. Yeah, he's
    a kid. So, based on that information, just what <em>should </em>his band sound like? In
    recent interviews Condon's discussed his interest in French pop and
    chanson. While that sound's yet to work its way into Beirut, this new EP includes some important upgrades.</p><p>
    Moving from his solo, Jeremy Barnes-accented bedroom recordings, Condon's now part of an eight-piece band. Smart move. <em>Gulag</em>
    showed promise and also limitations: In retrospect, the most intriguing
    sounds often amounted to ambient pastiche. Pretty but vacant. Now, a
    solid, pulsing group of players fleshing-out his songs, Condon opens to
    something less paint-by-numbers static-- it's more alive.</p><p>
    He shows, albeit briefly, that he can write songs without, as a
    friend called it, ""that Beirut thing""-- i.e., not everything needs a
    quasi-Neutral Milk Hotel horn swell. But, note the subtle echo of <em>On Avery Island</em> in <em>Lon Gisland</em>, on which he even pokes fun at charges of cultural
    appropriation, transforming hairspray and pizza joints into foreign
    territory. Touché! Tellingly, the cover painting uses a collage technique
    to transport the band to a scene of black-and-white historical figures
    afloat in a green, green river.
    </p><p>
    It's a tiny offering, a 16-minute stopgap before the sophomore
    full-length scheduled for this fall. (The EP's been released in Europe
    as a part of <em>Gulag Orkestar </em>and
    as a one-side 12"" by Chouette.) There are three new songs, a new
    incidental instrumental that echoes its neighbors, and a full-band
    remake of ""Scenic World"".
    </p>
<p>
    Opener ""Elephant Gun"" begins with that familiar ukulele sound and
    Condon giving his critics enough rope to hang themselves: ""If I was
    young, I'd flee this town/ I'd bury my dreams underground."" He's
    young... get over it. The song has joyousness to it-- it feels less
    downcast, nostalgic or mournful than the previous material; it's
    somehow more authentic for that. It's stately and deep, bottomed out
    with marching band drums, Condon's soaring vocals quaver. At the end,
    the track shifts gears, drifting into another flavor of accordion and
    horn.
    </p>
<p>
    A waltzing ""Carousels"" takes the listener to Coney Island with
    Morrissey to ""watch the faces go 'round."" Here, there's a whole lot of group singing.
    Musically, the repeated motifs are nice, showing Condon unafraid to
    really open up and play. A sound of water floats in the background--
    but when you listen closer, it could also be the distant bustle of the
    city. It's hard to tell. Here, sounds are never clear-cut.
    </p>
<p>
    The incidental pieces are small but effective. ""My Family's Role in
    the World Revolution"", a polka piano rave-up, is an instrumental given
    signs of life with laughs and a sighing producer. Again, it's upbeat,
    opening up a riotous saw duster with Charlie Brown piano, glockenspiel,
    and martial beats. Tossed off, sure, but fun.
    </p>
<p>
    The other instrumental, ""The Long Island Sound"" plays on sound
    (something you hear, the physical space where you get wet, salt and
    fresh water mixing it up). You can make out water, or whatever, in the
    background as well as an echo of ""Elephant Gun"", an accordion and
    bass-trumpet reprise. It very much feels like it's coming over a wire
    recorder á la the Microphones. Like the other piece, it's a
    swatch of sound, another bit in the collage.
    </p>
<p>
    Most interesting is the band's new take on ""Scenic World"". For <em>Gulag</em>,
    it was the song that justifiably snagged Magnetic Fields comparisons. That cute lilt's been replaced with a slower, statelier unfurl:
    Condon comports himself in less bubbly way and any cartoonish residuals
    disappear in the slower pace. Also, tapping drum sticks are placed
    upfront and become a sort of undulating Indian percussion background;
    the original's horn parts are doubled on violin and accordion.
    Basically, you're hearing an older Beirut tuned played by a group,
    offering the listener a sense of community, rather than some kid alone
    in his room cuddling his 4-track. It's how this music should be
    experienced.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Lon Gisland</em> marks a positive progression-- in these 16 minutes Condon has shown that, yes, there <em>are</em>
    songs behind the international flavors, that his work would be
    interesting even if kept the trumpet at home. It's clear, too, just how
    much age and gravity he holds in his voice and not just the sound
    around him. Most important of all? It seems Condon's getting all this-- by embracing the developments, he's started to go beyond chewing
    the scenery to, well, actually living in it.

    his 500th show on the Strip. He's just run through an awesomely dire
    song with his daughter and some horseplay with Dean Martin, but now he
    gives the rubes what they've been waiting for. ""Here's your chance;
    horns up fellas,"" he tells his band, and, as they rev up for the
    opening, high-kicking bars of his latter-day signature tune, Frank
    takes a moment to tease the crowd, to remind them of where he and
    they've come from, and where they're heading back. ""Chicago! Chicago! A
    wonderful town, a toddlin' town!"" And then: ""I left my heart in…<em>Kansas City!</em>"".
    Waiting for the laffs to subside before finally tearing into a
    showstopping ""New York, New York""-- John Kander and Fred Ebb's irresistible, cornball hymn to little-town blues and vagabond dreams.</p><p>
    But for all Sinatra's poise and pose as the voice of 20th century
    loneliness, when he's singing about ""My Kind of Town"" we know he really
    means Vegas. Did he ever dedicate a song to it? You imagine, even in
    his most desperate attempts to broach a truce with rock'n'roll, he had
    too much class for the shit-kicking redneck glee of ""Viva Las Vegas"".
    Of course, he didn't have to sing about the place because he so
    successfully embodied it. More than Maggio in ""From Here to Eternity"",
    than Major Bennett Marco in ""The Manchurian Candidate"", maybe even more
    than the ""Frank Sinatra"" conjured up across those 1950s Capitol
    recordings from <em>In the Wee Small Hours</em> to <em>Where Are You?</em>, Sinatra's enduring role was King of Las Vegas-- a method performance built up over three decades.</p><p>
<em>
    Vegas: Live</em> is an epic compendium of this performance, five
    discs of previously unreleased material that take us down the Strip of
    memory from the Sands 1961 to the Golden Nugget 1987. They reveal a
    Sinatra who is by turns: king of the saloon bar singers; instinctive
    Democrat; humorless bully; stupendous bandleader; shameless ham; bored
    hack; the first of the great Bogart impersonators; bewildered showbiz
    vet; aging Republican; undisputed heavyweight of the 20th century
    songbook; and the Mickey Mouse who welcomes you to the Mob's own
    themepark. It's never less than riveting.
    </p><p>
    With the first disc-- 1961 at the Sands-- he's already got the role
    down cold. Recorded off the back of the brazen yet triumphant folly of <em>Ocean's 11</em>,
    it finds a Sinatra arrogantly, effortlessly on top after his long 1950s
    of dog duets, voice-loss, and Ava Gardner. He can't help guying his
    maudlin persona in front of the guys. If <em>Casablanca</em> was
    essentially a ""women's picture for men"" (as David Thomson puts it) then
    Sinatra had been a torch singer for tough guys-- he took so much from
    Bogart, even down to the name of the Rat Pack. But here he goofs his
    way through ""The One I Love Belongs to Somebody Else"" and
    ""Imagination"", indulges in a half-baked parody of ""River, Stay 'Way
    From My Door"" so that it refers to Jack Entratter-- Manager of the
    Sands, Mob veteran, one of the guys who'd leant on Warners to ensure
    Sinatra got the career-saving role in <em>Eternity</em>. The closest he gets to the performance of sincerity is ""Young at Heart"": ""Fairytales can come true, it could happen to you"".
    </p>
<p>
    The second disc is taken from the same 1966 set that became <em>Sinatra at the Sands</em>
    (the one live show released in his lifetime), and though Frank sounds
    heroically sloshed the performance is supercharged by the astonishing
    power of Count Basie's band. ""Hold on a second,"" says Sinatra in a lull
    midway through ""I've Got You Under My Skin"". ""We're going to take this
    here building and move it three feet this way… hold onto your handbags""
    as the band roar out from behind him like a brass jet engine.
    </p>
<p>
    You also see the smooth showbiz veneer begin to slip. ""Good morning
    you bunch of drunks,"" he greets the crowd. ""Oh, I see a lot of booze
    and wine flowin' around here tonight! Hot damn! This is a night, eh?
    Saturday?""
    </p>
<p>
    ""You betcha!"" cheers a guy from the audience, taken in by the bonhomie.
    </p>
<p>
    ""I didn't ask you to answer me,"" snaps back Sinatra. Idolizing Dean
    Martin, appreciating his hip screwball act with Jerry Lewis, Sinatra
    tried to capture their ironic repartee within himself, but was so often
    revealed as naturally humorless-- his idea of wit being a few
    supposedly affectionate cracks at Sammy Davis Jr. But even here he
    delivers a terrific, sensitive performance of ""The September of My
    Years"", easing into his late mode as bittersweet nostalgist. 
    </p>
<p>
    By 1982, after some epic disagreements, Sinatra was through with the
    Sands: ""Welcome to the Palace of the Caesars, where there are now 13--
    me. There were 12 before, but we chased them out of town because they
    couldn't swing."" The little Caesar role feels more like bravado now; he
    seems happier with the old saloon songs. ""I Can't Get Started"" is a
    sublime acknowledgment of the failures behind all the fronting, while
    ""These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)"" is cracked, flawed, and utterly captivating.
    </p>
<p>
    1987, now at the Golden Nugget and he's beginning to sound a little
    like a Sinatra impersonator. ""Guess what?"" he announces, ""I've got
    the…World on a String!"", like Steve Martin declaring that he's got <em>happy feet</em>--
    but his phrasing is beginning to let him down, he's easing round the
    swerves in the melody gingerly, like a guy concerned about the ache in
    his hips. Introducing a Garlandy medley of ""The Gal That Got Away"" and
    ""It Never Entered My Mind"" he gets sadly befuddled about the
    songwriters, and you worry it may become a camp fiasco. But he wins the
    songs over determinedly, as though he still had the notion that he
    could woo back Ava, even after all these years.
    </p>
<p>
    He seems genuinely excited to be singing a Stevie Wonder song-- ""You
    Are the Sunshine of My Life""-- but sounds stilted in the big band
    arrangement. Having brazened out the approach of rock'n'roll for so
    long, now, in his seventies, a lion in winter, he finally
    sounds like a man out of time. The finest song here is ""I Get Along
    Without You Very Well"", almost whispered over a swoon of strings. ""It's
    about a big fat liar,"" he declares at the end, as though to an earlier
    self, almost amazed he got out of it alive.

    outfit Hella could be broken up. Or they could be releasing a 12-hour
    DVD concert box set. Hell, they could even have ditched the
    experimental math rock and become a Tom Jones cover band in Vegas. In
    other words, when an insanely talented band, frenetically producing
    material with an endless frontier mentality towards experimentation,
    operates under the auspices of a cultish fanbase, said band's career
    path takes on the unpredictability and inconsistency of a <em>Choose Your
    Own Adventure</em> book. While Hella's longtime, close-knit lineup of
    founders Spencer Seim and Zach Hill allowed for such a fluid shifting
    of gears, last year's <em>Acoustic</em> marked the first time the band recorded as a quintet. On <em>There's No 666 in Outer Space</em>,
    Hella's first release on Ipecac, that quintet gets completely revamped
    (save for Seim and Hill) and the band's sound gets jacked up.</p><p>
    Although difficult to tell with such a protean group, <em>666</em> seems
    to represent a shift for Hella. This is their first
    release to feature vocals on every track, and as a result of new singer
    Aaron Ross' caterwauls, Seim and Hill's once freeform compositions
    tend to concede more readily to conventional rock structures. Also,
    Ipecac's hallowed studio walls apparently instilled a sense of the
    dramatic in Hella's songwriting, as many of the songs-- while not wholly
    earnest or dire-- soar to lofty heights whereas previous tongue-in-cheek
    compositions would have them fall flat on their face.</p><p>
    Hmm, carefully deliberate sections? Sprawling compositions? Emotionally
    intense vocals? If it sounds like Hella's gone prog, they kinda have,
    veering close to the Mars Volta's shopping mall prog with
    Eastern-tinged guitar riffs, arcane lyrics and Ross's soaring voice,
    which eerily resembles Volta frontman Cedric Bixler's. For example,
    even the most sycophantic fans will experience mild cardiac arrest
    when, on songs like ""The Things People Do When They Think No One's
    Looking"", the band implodes at the four minute mark, only to neatly
    regroup for a closing chorus featuring Ross' charged lyric ""Money
    doesn't make the world go round.""</p><p>
    That said, this <em>is</em> still the freewheeling band that recorded
    a song titled ""Welcome to the Jungle Baby, You're Gonna Live!"" On ""Hand
    That Rocks the Cradle"", Hella parody monolithic acts like Rush or
    Yes, farting out goofy synth lines while Ross vacillates between Geddy
    Lee falsetto and slack-jawed Les Claypool hokum. At times <em>666</em>
    even flashes a calmer, gentler Hella-- relatively speaking. The verse on
    ""Anarchists Just Wanna Have Fun"" ripples around Seim's muted
    faux-Fugazi riff and Ross's sing-song melody, while ""The Ungrateful
    Dead"" parlays the 8-bit Nintendo epics covered by Hella side project
    the Advantage into a stomping opus that'd fry any <em>Castlevania</em> cartridge. Tracks like these don't give <em>666</em>
    a free pass solely because they combine the
    histrionic with the cheeky. Hella jampacks each song with riffs and
    hooks at almost the same clip as magnum opus <em>Chirpin' Hard</em>,
    avoiding the ham-handed ten minute build-ups that Mars Volta trudges
    through, arriving at a chorus hardly worth the wait. Excusing the
    album's inherent garishness, <em>666</em> expands Hella's core sound to
    new heights that, although at times hard to stomach, finds the band
    both at their most playful and regimented.</p></div>"|9828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9828-theres-no-666-in-outer-space/|7.0|Adam Moerder

    The adjective ""cinematic"" is regularly
    attributed to a wide swath of pop music, but obviously loses much of its direct
    filmmaking connotation in the translation, instead adopting the longstanding,
    romanticized idea of ""movie magic"" (one being reified by the industry
    itself throughout the current awards season). Thus, Marko Nyberg's quote on
    Husky Rescue's website that his music under this name is ""strongly
    influenced by the power of films and the hypnotic quality of photography and
    paintings,"" while hinting that Nyberg probably doesn't watch a lot of
    movies on his iPod, could be taken with the same grain of salt as most other
    self-scribed PR blurbs.</p><p>
    But while there are certainly elements to <em>Ghost Is
    Not Real</em> that could fit under the ""cinematic"" heading, they're
    mostly tempered by Nyberg's equally noticeable tendency toward the timid,
    bordering on precious-- an imagined collaboration, perhaps, between Ingmar
    Bergman and Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Nyberg is cautiously ambitious with his
    arrangements, almost to a fault: He pushes the boundaries of bombast at times,
    but always mitigates extravagance with fragility. Nyberg's secret weapon in
    this dynamic balancing act: 20-year-old Reeta-Leena Korhola, whose delicate
    voice and folky tendencies hover in Nyberg's frosty atmospherics like breath on
    a frigid Finnish winter morning.</p><p>
<em>Ghost</em> is a fitting follow-up to Husky Rescue's
    first record <em>Country Falls</em>, and arguably uses Korhola's voice to greater
    effect. <em>Falls</em> was filled with odes to warm weather and sunshine, and two
    years later, is succeeded by an album pierced by winter chill. Together, they
    work as a diptych that illustrates the contrasting seasons of Finland's unique
    climate: surprisingly warm, given its latitude, but with harsh, unforgiving
    winters.
    </p>
<p>
    Korhola and Nyberg work best together when her doe-eyed
    plaint meets his breezy pulses halfway, as on the gentle, bucolic swoon of
    ""Diamonds In the Sky"", and later on the tempest-in-a-teapot
    ""Hurricane (Don't Come Knocking)"". On ""Diamonds"", Korhola's
    lullabies glide gently over a bed of skittering drums and languid guitars that
    sound as if they were pulled straight from the masters of <em>Dark Side of the
    Moon</em>'s ""Breathe"". For its part, ""Hurricane"" is Ghost's most
    effective loud/soft exercise, with Korhola's most forceful vocals continually
    giving way to Nyberg's captivating swirl of picked acoustic guitars and synths.
    </p>
<p>
    The album is least effective when it upsets its
    equilibrium by either swaying too far in one direction or failing to
    effectively restrain its ideas. The bumbled spoken-word of both ""Shadow
    Run"" and ""Silent Woods"" are failed attempts at sinister
    mood-pieces that end up sounding like bargain-bin Cibo Matto, and bring the
    album to a grinding halt right before it concludes.
    </p>
    While
    not in the same league as <em>Falls'</em> pop wonder ""Summertime
    Cowboy"", ""Nightless Night"", <em>Ghost</em>'s second single, is the
    most obvious example of overabundance. Korhola rides through the verses on a
    chugging, muted guitar riff and makes her way to a satisfyingly fuzzed-out
    chorus. The lyrics, I assume, (as well as the song's video) refer to the
    amazing party that could take place during what's known as the ""midnight
    sun"" period in the Arctic region, when daylight lasts for 24 straight
    hours. ""Night"", however, chooses to mirror this phenomenon with an extended,
    and seemingly endless, middle section that stretches the song well-over seven
    minutes, when it only needs four or less. But this overabundance is indicative
    of the trap in which <em>Ghost Is Not Real</em> frequently finds itself. True
    to Nyberg's ""cinematic"" ambitions with this record, he too often
    overindulges his opulent side, when he would do best to sit back and let the
    story tell itself.</div>"|9809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9809-ghost-is-not-real/|6.9|Eric Harvey

His DFA-branded production prowess aside, it was uncertain at the time if LCD Soundsystem's 2002 12-inch ""Losing My Edge"" was meant to be anything more than a one-off amusement for a seemingly limited demographic of disco fans who can appreciate a good Captain Beefheart joke.</p><p>
    That LCD proved to be so much more bodes well for the future of No Bra-- aka the duo of German expat Susanne Oberbeck and Dale Cornish-- who've been making BBC DJs like Pete Tong snicker with their single ""Munchausen"". The song is essentially the London art-school answer to ""Losing My Edge""'s Williamsburg smack down, upgrading a monologue to a two-hander: Over a tinker-toy techno beat, Oberbeck and Cornish play two self-absorbed socialites trying to outdo each other with increasingly exaggerated accounts of their performance-art exploits, sexual transgressions, and squalid artist sustenance. (Cornish: ""I lived without electricity for three years."" Oberbeck: ""Really? I used to share a squat with Nina Hagen in Camden and she used to make pizza out of dead cats."") But the best joke is couched in the title itself: When Cornish brags ""I like listening to Karlheinz Munchausen,"" No Bra effectively expose the most reprehensible breed of scenester-- the chronic name-dropper who gets the names wrong.</p><p>
    If ""Munchausen"" is both clever and ridiculous enough to withstand repeat listens-- if nothing else, the song will forever change the way you say the word ""Really?""-- it's also the most incongruous entry point to a strange, sometimes disturbing album that's certainly not played for laughs. Save for the odd acoustic anomaly, <em>Dance and Walk</em> sounds just like something you'd find front-racked at the Rough Trade record shop in 1978 alongside the Normal and Cabaret Voltaire-- primitive, melody-deficient synth-punk whose sinister pulse and anarchic, amateurish quality often gave the impression of on-the-spot composition, as if the players were still figuring out how electronic technology could be applied to punk's devolutionary principles. In other words, music that's as creepily compelling as it is unapproachably aloof.</p><p>
    It's ironic that No Bra have found a vocal fan in Tong, since their brand of buzzing, clanging anti-pop muzik is more tailored to clearing rooms than filling dancefloors. But the austere presentation makes for an ideal complement to Oberbeck's manly mumble-- only when placed next to Cornish's even deeper deadpan does Oberbeck's voice betray a hint of her femininity. As the front cover shot of a topless Oberbeck with a blond Hitler moustache makes obvious, gender is a major talking/mocking point here-- opener ""Doherfuckher"" at first suggests a distinctly Frogs-like freak-folk crudity (""do her, fuck her…she takes it up the ass""), but acquires a subversive new dimension when Oberbeck changes the command part way to ""do him, fuck him""; and on the chilling ""X Sauna"", Oberbeck presents her own peculiar take on modern romance, with a striking central lyric-- ""I broke his heart/ I broke his neck""-- that's more involving than the typical camp of ""Motorcockhead"" (wherein Cornish declares, ""You make me feel like a woman/  You make me feel dead"") or the binary ""no bra!""/""green halter top!"" debate on (the rather awesomely titled) ""No Woman No Crime"". In their most intriguing turns, No Bra proffer an androgyny that's achieved not through each sex appropriating the characteristics of the other, but for each sex to abscond with those definitive characteristics altogether. Glum is the new glam.<br/></p></div>"|9819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9819-dance-and-walk/|6.8|Stuart Berman

    young George Miles gets totally fucked. Poor kid probably just wants to
    be loved-- either that or trip out on acid and live in Disneyland,
    whichever is more realistic-- but he falls prey to charlatans of all
    stripes. Old-fart perverts deface his flesh with loveless sexual
    violence. ""Do you know what's inside that cute body of yours?"" one
    asks, then comes brutally close to exposing the answers.</p><p>
    Atlanta five-piece Deerhunter, who hailed Cooper as a primary influence in a recent <em>Dusted</em>
    feature, show their guts admirably on this vast, visceral second album.
    Arranged in chronological sequence from two distinct recording
    sessions, <em>Cryptograms</em>
    is alternately murky and ethereal,
    amorphous and incisive, shot through with Sonic Youth guitar squall,
    Spacemen 3's blissful hymns, the morbidly introspective drum sounds of
    early
    Factory Records productions, and the abstract sonic richness of Harold
    Budd's collaborations with Brian Eno.</p><p>
    The album's willfully cryptic first half opens with a psych-out, both
    musically and mentally. Out
    of a nature scene's tranquility, a foreboding bassline and bird-calling
    keyboards summon singer
    Bradford Cox, who kicks off the galvanizing title track with a
    declaration of regret: ""My greatest fear/ I fantasized/ The days were
    long/ The weeks flew by/ Before I knew/ I was awake/ My days were
    through/ It was too... late."" As the song careens toward an
    increasingly chaotic climax, Cox finds his senses deteriorating until
    the final, indefinite repetition of the closing mantra: ""There was no
    sound."" Underpinned by Josh Fauver's primal bass and Moses Archuleta's
    paranoid drums, the similarly bleak ""Lake Somerset"" is a
    scream-saturated stomper with largely obscured lyrics about
    murder and pissing. No wonder Cox endured daily panic
    attacks throughout its recording.

</p>
<p>
    Deerhunter aren't content just to put their least welcoming side forward. <em>Cryptograms</em>
    also intersperses its loosely structured songs with a handful of
    extended, largely instrumental ambient passages. Guitarists Colin Mee
    and Lockett
    Pundt know their delay pedals-- the drifting chords on
    ""White Ink"" ring with the same washed-out analog shimmer that made
    Flying Saucer Attack's <em>Further</em> so powerfully <span class=""postbody"">nostalgic</span>,
    gradually filling in with low end as keyboards and vocal effects
    add layers of texture off in the distance. The dream-like ""Providence"",
    written on a Rhode Island tour stop
    with Lightning Bolt, sounds at once radiant and terrified. ""Octet""
    finds Cox's cries muffled behind the maelstrom, until the drums and
    bass lock together in the second half, erupting in a static-drenched
    propulsion that doesn't let up until a busy-signal organ tone segues
    into the droning, bell-swathed ""Red Ink"". The album's first half
    concludes with the tape to which the band recorded literally spinning
    off its reel. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>""She said, 'Dream dreams the dreamer'/ I said it's not my fault."" An
    earlier recording session was scrapped for, among other reasons, a
    poorly calibrated tape machine. At least one song here was written
    after several Ambien. Deerhunter's original bass player died in a
    tragic skateboarding accident; he'd just gotten clean.

</p>
<p>
    That first 30 minutes of <em>Cryptograms</em> is a slow but steady
    build towards the vastly more accessible latter half, recorded several
    months after the first. Opening with the perpetual climax of ""Spring
    Hall Convert"",
    these songs depict a Deerhunter reborn-- if not happy, then at least
    comfortably
    numb. Here, all that brooding sludge-psych and those airy backgrounds
    give
    way to swooning dream-pop and comparatively lucid songwriting: ""Strange
    Lights"" is the first track on <em>Cryptograms</em>
    with clearly decipherable lyrics, Cox waxing childlike about ""walking
    to the sun,"" bathed in bright, lambent guitars. The gauzy growing-up
    reminiscence ""Hazel St."" asks for protection in pop-glorified sunlight; portentous finale
    ""Heatherwood"", with its ramshackle percussion, promises another
    reincarnation. ""Was not seen again,"" several voices repeat, ending not
    with a bang but with an enigmatic whistle. 
    </p>

    The Deer Hunter <em>is a movie. ""Deer Hunter"" is a game. Deerhunter are
    a band that sometimes gets called Deer Hunter. Deerhoof are
    somebody else. Source(s): Twenty-five years on Earth, Google.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Of course, even the second recording session's highly melodic space-outs aren't fully
    coherent. As Cox
    laments in ""Hazel St."", ""The subject is always just out of frame."" At this point, with an album called <em>Cryptograms</em>,
    you're weird if you haven't been wondering what, exactly, the encoded
    message might be-- if, in fact, there is one at all. I like to think
    it's that Deerhunter are a pop band. 
    </p>
<p>
    After all, while <em>Cryptograms</em> presents its own obstacles, it's easily enjoyed as a whole. Memorable melodies
    and an awkward, charismatic narrator are often peeking from behind the
    dissonance-laden mists that self-consciously choke them. From <em>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</em> to Sid and Nancy, the sweetest romance of the rock underground's life was always death. And the tragic
    beauty of <em>Cryptograms</em>, as to an extent with Cooper's novels, is the way something as innocent as pop can be
    so mercilessly corrupted-- and due to the ensuing tension, emerge as
    better art for it.

    Rush, Ed Case-- and surely someone has snapped up ""Ed Wound"" or ""Ed
    Trauma"" by now?), French dance label Ed Banger's <em>nom de plume</em>
    says a lot about their sonic sensibilities: what better label home for
    Justice's crude but thrilling noisy house anthem ""Waters of Nazareth""?
    But it also says a lot about their sense of self. Compared to the
    hyper-stylisation of Kitsuné or Modular, the label's compatriots in the
    new French house/nu rave movement, Ed Banger can seem a bit scruffy
    and, well, simple, enthusiastically embracing a mindless hysteria which
    their friends prefer to present in quotation marks.</p><p>
    Not that it's the dancefloor which Ed Banger's hysteria necessarily aims for: As well as the <em>de rigeur </em>rock
    signifiers, the material on its first retrospective is
    distingushed by its infatuation with (mostly old skool) hip-hop, from
    Uffie's end-of-the-line devolution of Fannypack and Princess Superstar,
    to Krazy Baldheads' glitch-laden rap, to Busy P's cut-up cubist booty.
    Filtered through the unabashed plasticity and stuttering zaniness of
    the label's sonic approach, hip-hop's primary role is to provide an
    ironic balancing, to be a byword for unmediated and organic rawness
    amidst so much carefully programmed insanity. It's a shame, though,
    that the results usually cleave closer to Kid 606 demolishing NWA than
    Daft Punk's ""Oh Yeah"": no-one seems to have told these guys about the
    value of just running with a good groove.</p><p>
    On the other hand, the pall of 1999 which hangs over so much of the
    self-conscious production trickery here is ultimately kind of
    endearing, suggesting a goofy lack of good taste or timing. Most
    ridiculously, Vicarious Bliss' ""Theme From Vicarious Bliss"" sounds
    like the Bomfunk MCs remixing Third Eye Blind-- this is not exactly a
    bad thing, but it's hardly a career move you can
    really get behind. So it's not surprising that for their remix Justice
    manage to conjure up a vision of jaded rock cool that wasn't there in
    the original-- a bit disappointing that it's
    exactly the sort of half-hearted rock-dance fusion the label otherwise scores points for avoiding.
    </p><p>
    Somewhere between the dance, the rock, the IDM, and the hip-hop, Ed
    Banger's artists occasionally and perhaps unwittingly stumble across
    pop, and it's these inspired accidents that make <em>Ed Rec Vol. 1</em>
    halfway listenable. Para One's remix of DJ Mehdi's ""I Am Somebody"" is a
    dog's breakfast of Prince and hip-house, but it's indecisive messiness
    is also the key to its appeal, sounding like the leftovers from an
    aborted Basement Jaxx/Daft Punk collaboration that ended in tears. The
    pop in Ed Banger material exists on a sonic rather than conceptual
    level: as a song, Uffie's ""Pop the Glock"" is a totally unnecessary
    addition to the modern pantheon of sneering faux-MC triviality, but
    it's almost entirely redeemed by the extended Cher-like autotune
    harmonies that hover about Uffie's (intermittently torturous) vocals
    like a sickly aura. 
    </p>
<p>
    Ed Banger's best performer is SebastiAn, who contributes bleepy,
    glitchy EBM disco filtered through a production sensibility that's
    three parts Depeche Mode circa <em>Black Celebration </em>and
    one part Autechre, which is the same as being all parts Nine Inch Nails
    remixes. This is a reason to like him, in case you're wondering: He may
    be as enamoured with mid-range blare as Justice, but you get the
    impression that SebastiAn's aggression is a bit fey and girlish too,
    like he's hoping you'll notice how prettily he grits his teeth. On the
    whole, his labelmates could afford to be more girlish: currently their
    wide-eyed ambition is held in check by a certain air of male
    jocularity, which reveals itself in the wild mood swings between
    stomping noise and overly fussy digital editing. No-one here is
    interested in sounding polished or professional, which is fine, but I
    could wish for a slightly more feminine touch at times (and no, Uffie
    doesn't count). Like, how much better would anthems like ""Waters of
    Nazareth"" be with a diva squealing over the top? Give me that over another monotone rockstar performance anyday.

As chronicled over 18 months worth of Pitchfork contributor Martin Clark's ""Month In Grime/Dubstep"" column, the underground London scene that had spun off from UK garage around 2002 finally came into its own, suddenly championed everywhere from <em>The Wire</em> to the BBC to German minimal techno jocks to old school IDM heads to, well, Pitchfork. Most Americans, of course, weren't hitting up Travelocity to queue for the body-choked DMZ all-night parties (unless you happen to live in New York, your average house club probably hasn't picked up on the genre just yet) or setting their dial for Mary Anne Hobbs' radio shows. But a string of 2006 albums-- from Burial, Various Productions, Boxcutter, Kode 9 and Space Ape, as well as less heralded artists such as Skream, Distance, and Benga-- allowed curious Yanks who weren't trawling mp3 blogs for ripped DJ sets to test drive an unfamiliar sound.</p><p>
    I have a curious relationship with dubstep as a huge Anglophilic UK garage fan around the turn of the millennium whose interest waned the further dubstep got from garage's upbeat, intricate rhythm programming and radio-ready r&amp;b hooks. For a while in the depths of 2004, it felt like I would never have speakers with enough bass or smoke enough weed to ever get anything out of this stripped-down music. And while the genre is finally producing enough interesting records to justify its newfound rep, it bugged me that the records leading <em>to</em> dubstep were still so obscure and unavailable. As chronicled on Steve ""Kode 9"" Goodman's (now sadly offline) Hyperdub webzine between 1999 and 2003, it was UK garage's ""descent into darkness"" rather than its ""ignominious arrival,"" to paraphrase Simon Reynolds on dark and/or ""artistic"" jungle, that was so interesting.</p><p>
    So praise to Mr. Clark and his partner Ammunition for compiling <em>The Roots of Dubstep</em>, a thorough-as-one-CD-can-be history of dubstep's baby steps. Like the pretty young things they were, these records skipped where later dubstep can stomp: They were still trying to make dancers move-- rather than ""meditate on bass weight"" as dubstep pioneers Digital Mystikz would say-- even as tracks like El-B's ""Express"" and labels like Ghost were bringing a ghost-like reggae vibe to the rave. These were folks who used to make jungle, or kids who just went to jungle clubs, and while they got off on the winding tempo of UK garage, their goal wasn't to land a remix on the next S Club 7 single. Instead, as related by Clark in the liner notes to <em>Roots</em>, El-B and his boys were enthralled by the deadly deep sub-bass and serious grooves of the Metalheadz label, and they brought that head-nodding intensity into the garage. Dubstep officially arrived in 2002 with Horsepower Productions' epochal <em>In Fine Style</em> LP, and the Horsepower tracks are the best thing on <em>Roots</em>. Records like ""Gorgon Sound"" were near perfect mixtures of bubbling garage grooves, the haunted reverb of Germanic dub-techno like Maurizio, house divas, and reggae samples vibrating through the echo chamber. And Horsepower records have probably the best bass sound of any records released in the new millennium.
    </p><p>
    It's clear just to listen that a young South London producer named Burial had his wig seriously flipped by the days of Horsepower. But those who've fallen in love with the atmospheric grooves of the Burial album or Various Productions' bleak folk tweaks on the dubstep sound may still end up turned off by these experiments in snare timbre and bass sculpting. By the time we finish the compilation at Digital Mystikz's 2003 ""Pathwayz"", the heavy, repetitive thwack-thwack-thwack of the drums-- three zombie kicks followed by two snare cracks, looped with a vocal chant and a sour, grime-like synth line-- that characterized the genre's lean years is as spare and dry as the darkest modern techno. Little surprise that producers like Ricardo Villalobos-- whose ""Fizheuer Zieheuer"" seems to skank as much as it oompahs-- has begun pimping out his own minimal DJ sets with dubstep tunes. (As someone who's longed for a hookup between Perlon-style microhouse and the low-end of garage/dubstep for years, I want this marriage consummated ASAP.)
    </p>
<p>
    But even the warmer, earlier records-- the incandescent organs on Steve Gurley's ""Hotboys (Dub)"", the faded brass and trip-hop crackle of Phturistix's ""551 Blues""-- on <em>Roots</em> do little more than swing. Their garage-y off-beats are perhaps crisper and lighter than the brutal thump of the later halfstep sound, but dubstep is still a genre where fans cream themselves over how a producer drops his kick drum in a bar or what sort of filters the bassline gets pushed through. On ""Snakecharmer"", producer Menta ditches traditional drums for an absurdly intricate handclap groove that's fleshed out with a rimshot of tabla, a shaker, a cicada rustle, a twinkle of chimes, a leopard's roar, and two-note bass that dips like an airplane losing cabin pressure. ""Red"", on the other hand, is perhaps the birthplace of a genre built wobbly basslines, a froggy, warbling thing that actually plays off Artwork's twisting snares rather than simply growling beneath the beats. Listening to tracks like the way funky back-and-forth of DJ Abstract's ""Touch"", it's hard not to wish for a little more of this old-school complexity, disguised as a simple groove, in current dubstep. The hot new jacks might want to take a closer look back at their <em>Roots</em>.

    The term ""freak-folk""-- coined by this very website-- has, perhaps not surprisingly, become almost 
    universally disliked, particularly by those artists to whom it has been applied. 
    Yet no matter what description one uses to help classify the various 
    forms of contemporary avant-folk, there's little question that the Bay Area's 
    Noah Georgeson should be considered one of the genre's chief architects. In the 
    past few years, Georgeson has produced such notable works as Joanna Newsom's 
    <em>The Milk-Eyed Mender </em>and Vetiver's<em> To Find Me Gone</em>, played 
    alongside Devendra Banhart and recorded his <em>Cripple Crow</em> album, and 
    produced Bert Jansch's recent Drag City release <em>The Black Swan</em>. In the 
    wake of all this activity now appears Georgeson's solo debut <em>Find 
    Shelter</em>, a strange and unassuming album whose lush, brooding surfaces bear 
    surprisingly little comparison to his previous production work.</p><p>
    As a young musician and composer, Georgeson counted his Nevada City neighbor 
    Terry Riley as one of his earliest listeners, and with Riley's recommendation he 
    entered the Master's program at Mills College. While pursuing his degree he 
    studied under such artists as Pauline Oliveros, Alvin Curran, and Fred Frith. 
    Georgeson wrote, arranged and recorded the songs that would eventually take 
    shape on <em>Find Shelter</em> between 1999 and 2003, penning most of it while 
    living with Newsom as she was writing the bulk of <em>Milk-Eyed Mender</em>.</p><p>
    Predictably, given this background, <em>Find Shelter</em> sounds simply 
    marvelous from a production standpoint, its gentle surges of mellotron and 
    acoustic guitar perfectly balanced with Georgeson's elegant orchestrations. With 
    its cinematic atmospheres and idiosyncratic song structures, the album shares 
    little or nothing in common with the reverent folk-rock formalism of Banhart or 
    Jansch. Instead, <em>Find Shelter</em> makes its company alongside the work of 
    other in-studio eccentrics like producer Jack Nitzsche or Lee Hazlewood. The 
    resemblance to Hazlewood is especially acute in regards to Georgeson's quavering 
    Western vocal style, the limitations of which can also vaguely bring to mind a 
    hungover Beck. 
    </p>
<p>
    Due in part to Georgeson's narrow vocal range, there are points on <em>Find 
    Shelter</em> when he sounds to be almost audibly withdrawing from the spotlight, 
    as on the gracefully constructed ""Glorious Glory"" where he appears eager to 
    camouflage his vocal beneath as many verdant layers of strings and woodwinds as 
    possible. Likewise, such tracks as ""Wooden Empire"" obscure his skillful flamenco 
    guitar lines with blanketed drones, leaving many of these songs with an 
    indistinct line of vision, and many of his stately melodies stranded just 
    tantalizingly out of reach. 
    </p>
<p>
    This overriding sense of ambiguity is further heightened by Georgeson's 
    largely inscrutable lyrics. ""Sharpen two needles/ That puncture jungles/ Grow 
    cathedrals,"" he sings on ""Priests of Cholera"" as the music swells with hidden 
    drama and majesty, his voice buried just far enough in the mix to frustrate 
    further attempts to apprehend his narrative intent. Although <em>Find Shelter</em> 
    contains several passages of undeniable chamber-pop beauty--most notably (and 
    perhaps not coincidentally) on brief instrumental tracks like the opening ""Tied 
    to the Mountains"" or ""Shawm Overture""-- at album's end Georgeson himself remains 
    an elusive figure, sounding perfectly content to remain behind-the-scenes even 
    on his own record. Particularly when taken in contrast with such forceful and 
    distinctive musical personalities as Banhart and Newsom, one has to wonder if 
    Georgeson might simply be better served working more closely with another 
    musical foil, perhaps someone able to add either a little more folk or a lot 
    more freak.

It's her most popular song, having graced a crucial scene in Richard Linklater's 1995 film <em>Before Sunrise</em>, but more than that ""Come Here"" is such a perfect little moment-- so beautiful and subtly erotic in its restraint-- that very few songs can follow it. Unsurprisingly, not one of the baker's dozen tracks on the aptly titled Australian collection <em>Finally</em> can match it for concision, delicacy, directness, or just plain beauty. But that's not really saying very much. ""Come Here"" is devastating in its simplicity, with Bloom's crystalline voice conveying powerful desire as she sings straightforward lines like ""I am not impossible to touch/ I have never wanted you so much/ Come here."" It's both a lover's plea and an artist's invitation-- into open arms and into another person's interior life. ""Come Here"" shows Bloom as a supremely intuitive singer and songwriter, precise yet vulnerable in her phrasing and imagery, and despite a few bumps, <em>Finally</em> bears out that impression.</p><p>
    2006 was a strong year for singers like Bloom, female folkies whose short careers (if they can even be considered such) were in inverse proportion to their undeniable talent. Karen Dalton's glorious swansong <em>In My Own Time</em> saw the light of day again, as did obscurities by Judee Sill, Sybille Baier, and Sachiko Kanenobu. Even in this company, Bloom remains an outsider: She is from a younger generation than the others, starting her career in New York during the 1970s and retiring to Connecticut in the 1980s, but continuing to record into the present. All the tracks on <em>Finally</em> were recorded in the 1990s except two, which are from 2005. Her body of work from the 70s and 80s is legendary, but largely unheard: vague legal matters, perhaps surrounding her musical partnership with guitarist Loren Mazzacane Connors, prevent the official re-release of her early material.</p><p>
    The more recent songs on <em>Finally</em>, however, sound like they could have been recorded at any point during the last four decades. In addition to her gracefully lilting melodies, Bloom has retained her younger bohemian sensibilities, issuing sentiments along the lines of ""Why do we have to deal in money/ When it don't mean a thing it don't mean a thing?"" But she reminds herself: ""Oh yeah if you had money, you'd sure be drinking a better wine."" Unlike Neil Young on <em>Prairie Wind</em> or America on <em>Here &amp; Now</em>, she isn't trying to relive her hippie days or indulge easy nostalgia, mainly because Bloom never outgrew them, as her recent work (including political songs for recent New Hampshire senatorial candidate Ned Lamont) shows. A keen awareness of social inequalities plays out in these songs like a kind of broad activism: Lamenting her own depression and indecisiveness, she sings, ""The rich folk have psychiatrists/for the poor there's no one there/No amount of fancy talk will ever make it fair."" It's a pointed comment, but that last line shows an adult's realization that maintaining hope in the world is nearly impossible and maybe even futile. Instead, Bloom would rather change herself and live by her own code, even if the world around her appears so discouraging.
    </p><p>
    Bloom retreats into her music and takes an obvious joy in its work, allowing the certainty of the melodies to offset her emotional reservations. Despite its heartbreak, ""Forget About Him"" shuffles along with a chin-up tempo, alternately comical (""There's a boy up the road and he wants to take me out some/Well, he doesn't know that I'm not gonna be too much fun much fun much fun"") and tragic (""‘Cause when he kisses me, I'm gonna cry/ I do believe I'm gonna have to die to forget about him""). The steady smile with which Bloom faces every disappointment-- whether romantic, social, or even professional-- illuminates these bittersweet songs like a candle in a votive. Hopefully, <em>Finally</em> will be the first of many reissues.

    rock-- or you're not an indie rock fan-- the Clap Your Hands Say Yeah
    story should have a folkloric familiarity to you. To read an indie blog
    or webzine in 2005 was to hear the tale of five brave lads from Philly
    and Brooklyn who bypassed the Byzantine conduits of record labels and
    PR agencies, selling more than six figures' worth of their debut album
    on the merits of the music alone.</p><p>
    But online opinion is like a magnifying glass in sunlight: Whatever it admires too closely for too long is
    enlarged, then incinerated. There was truth in the emerging narrative,
    but it reflected longing more than reality; the band's story became the
    stuff of myth, and myths beg to be debunked. That
    crystallization was completed when mainstream publications began
    filling their pages with identical articles about the internet as
    independent music's democratic new frontier and adopting CYHSY as the
    trend's avatar.</p><p>
    This was how, in the space of a couple months, CYHSY were transformed
    from a unique phenomenon to a creative ideal, and the music contained
    on their still-terrific debut album became difficult to hear above the
    din of warring ideologues. ""Two years ago,"" the <em>Independent Online</em>'s
    Andrew Purcell wrote in a January 12 article, ""Clap Your Hands Say Yeah
    rewrote the rules of pop music, but this won't save them from the
    kicking that's coming their way."" He's probably right, but this isn't
    necessary if we're careful not to get our distaste for packaged
    mythology mixed up with distaste for the music itself. Before CYHSY's
    sophomore album <em>Some Loud Thunder</em> materialized, the question of
    how the band would follow its hot-topic debut seemed hopelessly
    complex. But given that the group had little to do with its own hype--
    and that Alec Ounsworth is by all credible reports a very private
    person who disdains public opinion-- the answer, in retrospect, is
    obvious: They made another Clap Your Hands Say Yeah record.
    </p><p>
    If <em>Some Loud Thunder</em> isn't as consistent as the debut, it's
    an adequate follow-up that contains a handful of fantastic songs, a
    handful of uneven ones, and a handful of duds. Famed producer Dave
    Fridmann (Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, Mogwai) brings his usual touch to
    the album-- it's denser than the debut, with even more towering
    harmonies. The only time Fridmann does the band a disservice is on the
    title track, which opens the record with the same sort of vague
    antagonism with which ""Clap Your Hands!"" kicked off the debut. ""Some
    Loud Thunder"" seems like a solid, peppy indie rock song, but it's such
    a mess that it's hard to tell for sure-- pickled in ugly distortion, it
    sounds like a bad rip. (Ounsworth claims the album is intended to be
    heard on vinyl; perhaps it works better there.) As a mission statement
    and a fuck-off, ""Some Loud Thunder"" is even more effective than ""Clap
    Your Hands!"": The latter was obviously intended to be daunting, while
    the former is rich with ambiguity. Was it meant to sound shitty or did
    it just turn out that way? Regardless, it's a drag to listen to. 
    </p>
<p>
    The most engaging songs here zero in on what CYHSY do best: cracked, brassy vocals, shaggy rhythms, and luxuriant
    melodies. The flickering luau-rock of ""Mama, Won't You Keep Them
    Castles in the Air and Burning?"" finds Ounsworth's clarion voice at its
    most affecting, eventually washing out in a tide of woozy harmonies.
    ""Love Song No. 7"", with its slithering vocal line and stark piano, is
    distinct from the band's usual fizzy shimmer; it's darker and finer
    than anything else on the record. ""Underwater (You and Me)"" profits
    from its density, with tight coils of reverbed guitar spring-loading
    the bouncy melody. These tracks find CYHSY tweaking their template with
    more sumptuous, Fridmann-assisted layers, with excellent results. 
    </p>
<p>
    An entire album of songs this well-tuned would have trumped the debut, but <em>Some Loud Thunder</em>
    bogs down in some uneven ideas. The transition from bright acoustic
    jangle to crispy garage-psych on ""Emily Jean Stock"" is vitalizing, but
    Ounsworth's drooping affectations emphasize the hokier qualities of his
    voice. The goofy yet fun ""Satan Said Dance"" is an indie-dance track
    laced with twittering sci-fi keyboards; one wonders if the indie world
    is comfortable enough with its relationship to dancing to enjoy a
    song about Hell being a place where Satan makes you dance. I have a
    soft spot for the admittedly overcooked ""Yankee Go Home"", a
    Destroyer-caliber piece of musical theater where Ounsworth gets to
    inflect the hell out of lubricated words naturally suited to his
    slippery voice, like ""Honolulu."" Rounding out these problematic tracks
    are stillborns like the meandering ""Arm and Hammer"" and the throwaway
    gypsy instrumental ""Upon Encountering the Crippled Elephant"". 
    </p>
<p>
    In the end, one wonders if the hype didn't exert a subtle influence on
    CYHSY after all. Consider that Ounsworth, who represents himself as
    being neither comfortable nor interested in anything resembling a
    spotlight, has answered that hype with a murkier, weirder album than
    the one that spawned it, one that seems pulled in too many different
    directions. Then consider how the title <em>Some Loud Thunder</em>
    seems, deliberately or not, to refer to the very extra-musical
    cacophony that Ounsworth claims to be unaffected by. A wheel's stationary hub
    might not care about its spin, but it still feels the pressure of all those whirling spokes.

    A silent b-boy constantly traversing the outer regions of music and headspace.
    A shadowy ex-Native Tongue consort resurrected behind an inch-thick metal mask.
    A vinyl archeologist from Tennessee entrusted with resurrecting a lost tribe of
    hip-hop architects. The child of a musical legend who mixes acid rock with
    bedtime stories and is forgotten for two decades. And, finally, a DJ who took
    refuge in underground ethics after seeing his career deteriorate and his partner
    murdered.</p><p>
    This isn't your usual indie hip-hop crew, so it should be no surprise that
    this Stones Throw retrospective isn't your typical hits comp. It's
    odd and unpredictable, with most tracks culled from the margins of their
    catalog. But the label has always focused on Peanut Butter Wolf and Egon's
    evangelical zeal for obscurity, so this disc rightly feels like more of a
    personal scrapbook than a public document.</p><p>
    After all, Stones Throw obsesses over cultural quips-- the asides that were either never heard or understood, oftentimes not even by their creators. And
    the most interesting cuts here are half-formed ideas, tangents too awkward
    for mass consumption. The creepy New Wave of Gary Wilson's ""Gary's in the
    Park"" sounds like a collaboration between Devo and Norman Bates, while
    Stark Reality's ""Comrades and Dreams"" is preschool psych, mingling
    innocence and fear. Sure, some of it's more interesting than listenable, but there
    are moments of beauty that need no footnotes: Madlib's achingly strained
    strings on ""Falling"" juxtaposed against Dudley Perkins' gravelly
    pleads; Koushik's airy acoustic pop on ""Be With"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Few of these are obvious picks for a Stones Throw comp-- the only
    no-brainers are Jaylib's ""The Red"", with its vintage Dilla
    production, and Lootpack's ""Whenimondamic"", an early classic from the
    label's breakout artist, Madlib. On one hand, this sort of focus is necessary.
    After all, the label's masterworks-- Quasimoto's <em>The Unseen</em>,
    Madvillain's <em>Madvillainy</em>, J. Dilla's <em>Donuts</em>-- are concept albums,
    cohesive and whole works that defy atomization. When taken out of context, they
    lose their power. 
    </p>
<p>
    Still, one wonders why Quasimoto's ""Low Class Conspiracy"" was
    chosen over, say, the desolate French Pop/Blaxploitation mash-up of ""Come
    on Feet"", or why a B-side remix of Madvillain's ""Figaro"" was
    picked instead of the more celebrated ""All Caps"" or ""Accordion"".
    But this is the iPod age, and there are probably thousands of unofficial Stones
    Throw comps floating around. This is a more personal perspective from a label that focuses on the margins.

    As far as nicknames go, you can't do much better than
    the ""Lion of Zimbabwe."" Forget, for the moment, that much of
    Zimbabwe's lion population has fallen prey to poaching or succumbed to the
    depletion of its habitat. Concentrate instead of the power conveyed by that
    title. Lion. King of the Jungle. King of All Beasts. The Lion King.</p><p>
    Hmm, that's another word to consider. King. King. If
    there's one word that trumps ""lion"" it's ""king."" No wonder,
    then, that musician Thomas Mapfumo, Lion of Zimbabwe, is considered a security
    threat by the paranoid, oppressive government of his homeland and in particular
    leader-for-life Robert Mugabe, Mapfumo's fellow former freedom fighter turned
    monster.</p><p>
    The lion is the national symbol of Zimbabwe, and
    Mapfumo has long been one of the country's national treasures. Yet even
    Mapfumo, an outspoken critic of Mugabe's destructive and dangerous
    dictatorship, can no longer call Zimbabwe home, having relocated from Zimbabwe
    in 2000 to the not-very-exotic environs of Eugene, Oregon, where he's lived as
    in exile ever since, safe but homesick. Much of his family remains in Africa,
    and so, clearly, does his heart. 
    </p>
<p>
    That certainly explains how Mapfumo has been able to
    sustain his anger over three productive decades of music making, which have not
    just extended but deepened his reign as folk hero. What's been even more
    remarkable has been the prolonged power of his songwriting itself. Even in
    Oregon, away from the horrors and vast disappointments of Zimbabwe, Mapfumo's
    no lion in repose. He's kept up a prolific pace, releasing nearly a disc of his
    Chimurenga (or ""music of struggle"") a year while constantly touring
    with his band Blacks Unlimited. 
    </p>
<p>
    Originally released as a download-only album but picked
    up last year by Peter Gabriel's Real World, <em>Rise Up</em> features a slightly
    more pared-down Blacks Unlimited, who now include a few Americans in their midst.
    Yet most of the hallmarks of classic Mapfumo remain intact: the circular guitar
    patterns, the pulses of organ, the pluck of multiple mbira, the call of horns,
    the cry of female backing singers. Mapfumo's often drawn comparisons to Bob
    Marley, and the melodies and performances here do share a certain soulfulness,
    spirituality, and conviction. If Mapfumo chose to sing in English rather than
    his native Shona, who knows? Maybe frat guys across the country would be
    listening to him as well. 
    </p>
<p>
    They're not, of course. Nor are they likely troubled by
    the same issues that trouble Mapfumo, even if they're delivered with a hint of
    a reggae (particularly in the drum fills) and hypnotic polyrhythms. As
    Mapfumo's anthems helped fuel Mugabe's 1980 rise to power-- Mapfumo's
    ""songs of struggle"" were originally enlisted against then-Rhodesia's
    white-minority rule-- the singer no doubt feels the need to pay penance in the
    form of his critical songs, his moral authority heightened not hampered by the
    ironic role he played in the corruption of his own ideals. 
    </p>
<p>
    That's not to strike idealism from the repertoire. Like
    Marley, Mapfumo excels at lifting your spirits even as he decries the things
    bringing his people down. There's a pulsing, double-time bass drum pattern in
    ""Vanofira Chiiko? (What Are They Dying For?)"" that helps transform
    the lament into an unlikely fist-pumper. The synth-bass prodding ""Ndodya
    Marasha (I'm Mad as Hell)"" lends an almost imperceptible urgency to the
    repetitive, deceptively static chord progression, until an upbeat break busts
    you out of the funk. 
    </p>
<p>
    Then there are the other moments of outright ingenuity,
    invention, and surprise. The first few minutes of ""Marudzi
    Nemarudzi/Different Races"" shames, say, the Red Hot Chili Peppers'
    ""Snow (Hey Oh)"" while using a similar melody and a straight backbeat,
    but then jumps the rails in the best sense and heads off on a skanking
    half-beat tangent. ""Ndodya Marasha"" uses the same trick, only the
    other way around, suddenly shifting gears and picking up the pace when you least
    expect it to. 
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe the tempos are slightly slower than they once
    were, and Mapfumo himself sometimes sounds surprisingly sedate for a man with
    so much on his mind. He's older, after all. But if there's anything <em>Rise Up</em>
    proves, it's that you don't need to scream to be heard.

    In the Great Indie Girl-Group Boomlet of 2005-present, the four all-female
    singers and three all-male band members of Brooklyn's Tralala pretty much step
    to the snap of their own Bubble Tape. Look, the Pipettes and El Perro del Mar
    dressed the Shangri-Las or Ronettes in new, indie-pop knickers. The Long
    Blondes added Britpop spleen and 1970s UK punk charge. Named after both <em>Last
    Exit to Brooklyn</em>'s gang-rape victim and the, uh, sing-songy nonsense
    phrase, Tralala layer energetic, roughshod vocal harmonies over sugary Ramones
    punk. Strawberries on Frosted Flakes, right?</p><p>
    A lot of the time, sure. Tralala's sound is a more finely distilled sonic
    reference than those of their peers, and on sophomore album <em>Is That</em> <em>the
    Tralala</em> the group's sharply focused young-love-in-NYC pop songs hint toward
    an extroverted, female-fronted Exploding Hearts. Opener ""We're Coming Out"" is a punk-is-fun prelude to a girl's night
    out, while ""Are You Gonna Dance (With Me)"" briskly chastises a
    wallflower date (""Did you just come to stare?"") and ""Early
    Tonight"" sneaks out for boyfriendless good times. You're more likely to
    find songs about drunken cab rides (""Yellow Taxi"") or not wanting to
    eat for fear of ruining a buzz (""BLT"") than one of the Hearts'
    lovesick calls, but some of the same energy is present. Also present: a song about those dead West Virginia coal miners (""Tallmansville, W. Va."").</p><p>
    Ripped from your last year's headlines, that song's a bit more serious than
    even terse psychodramas like ""No Pain No Pain"", from Tralala's 2005
    self-titled debut. Little else changes on <em>Is That</em> <em>the Tralala</em>,
    least of all, thankfully, the group's gritty production. An exception: Extended
    headlight metaphor ""One Hard Turn Deserves Another"" and extended
    James Bond-style shoe-heel armament metaphor ""Secret Weapon"" give
    guitarist Chris Talsness a chance to break out of his default fuzz-tone
    downstrums for some Television-esque solo heroics. Someone obviously isn't
    drinking enough.
    </p>
<p>
    Whatever, two albums in, it's pretty clear Tralala aren't entirely a
    put-on-- ties to band managers and influential New York record store Other
    Music be damned. It's tough not to make believe there's something going on here
    besides girls with amateurish voices having fun with their friends, singing
    'bout boys 'n' booze. Like: ""You think I'm retrospective of someone you
    used to know,"" goes the Wipers cover ""Mystery"", so it might almost be some
    elaborate meta-tease... or another post-riot-grrrl song about boys. Anyway,
    these dudes (gender-neutral, dammit!) may have great bangs, decent chops, and
    stupidsmart rock 'n' roll panache, but I still wish my favorite song by them
    wasn't off their 2005 Christmas EP.

Comprised
    mostly of former OnAirLibrary! and Boggs members, Daylight's founding
    members Jay Giampietro and Phillip Wann fluff up their previous bands'
    more experimental sounds, a move made easy with the help of Amanda
    Garrett's ethereal vocals. (On!Air!'s Claudia Deheza, the group's original vocalist, left the band to pursue other projects, despite providing vocals for many of the tracks here.) Although titled <em>Trouble Everywhere</em>,
    the group's debut lacks any sort of nervous tension, instead retreating
    into bucolic jam sessions and detached cooing. While not tackling the
    most ambitious soundscapes, Daylight's proudly keep their heads in the
    clouds long enough to cull some dishy, albeit homogenous, numbers.</p><p>
    Part of <em>Trouble</em>'s homogeneity stems from the band's rote
    dedication to dream pop. Never ruffling feathers with a
    proactive riff or overly catchy melody, any flirtation with other
    genres occurs incidentally. Initially opener ""To No One"" may sound like
    shoegaze with all those looped synths over a droning bassline, but an
    emotive chorus punches gaping holes in the song's wall of sound.
    Similarly, ""Bad Sleep Well"" starts on a stern drum fill and moody
    guitar chords only to have the seemingly imminent noise-rock blowup
    tempered by passive-aggressive vocal distortion and a brass section
    cacophony that's more effete than enraged.</p><p>
    All limits considered, <em>Trouble</em>'s not necessarily a
    snooze-a-thon, at least in the pejorative sense. The aforementioned
    chorus to ""To No One"" may dash the song's shoegaze elements, but much
    of the album thrives on such show-stopping moments. After Garrett lulls
    you to sleep for the album's first half, Wann delivers deadpan vocals
    on the title track, complementing Garrett's soothing songs and playing
    the Lou Reed to her Nico. As if in response, the band's dreamscape
    briefly turns to nightmare on the eerily sparse and askew ballad ""Try"",
    a track that, at its darkest, resembles the psychosis of My Brightest
    Diamond. Unfortunately, that's about as far as the band veers from its
    tried and true formula.  If every song had a chord progression as
    interesting as ""Worlds Apart"", the lone exception to the handful of
    starry-eyed bombs here, <em>Trouble</em>'s zonked out demeanor would be vindicated. As is, <em>Trouble</em>
    steers clear of any damning errors or blatant mimicry, but the result's
    sadly too safe and vanilla for a band that shows flashes of so much
    more.</p></div>"|9817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9817-trouble-everywhere/|6.5|Adam Moerder

    doesn't sound like one, piling on the ethereal guitars and synths like Dagwood
    piles on the cold cuts. At least I think those are synths. Some of them could
    be guitars-- it's the kind of record where things blend, and you only start to
    notice the constituent parts after a few listens. Even then, extricating that
    lovely, wordless female voice that sometimes colors the texture from the
    guitars is nearly impossible. She's the silver lining on the cloud of vibrating
    strings.</p><p>
    The owner of that voice, Christine Glass Byrd, also isn't a
    member of the duo-- she and cellist Matt Slocum are brought in at strategic
    points to enrich the astral spaces created by Marc Byrd and Andrew Thompson. At
    75 minutes and 18 songs, it could be charged that the album is overlong,
    especially given its general uniformity, but that would also miss the
    point-- this is meant to be a contrail in a solid blue
    sky, a smear of sound that goes oddly well with any number of emotional states.
    You could call it ambient music, for the most part, but it obviously draws many
    of its cues from non-ambient sources like Sigur Rós and Slowdive-- the distant
    sound of the drums in particular reminds me of <em>Souvlaki</em>.</p><p>
    Three vocal tracks (not counting those wordless female
    interjections) rear up from the mostly instrumental landscape, somewhat like
    the starched, posed jackets set on the barren salt flat in the cover art, but
    these are only slightly more direct than what surrounds them, with minimal
    lyrics delivered in a soft falsetto that melts into the slides guitars, e-bows,
    and other glass-like noises around it.
    </p><p>
<em>Raising Your Voice…</em>
    isn't especially innovative; it is, however,
    an unassuming
    record that speaks to all those things in our lives that aren't tangible, yet
    feel nearly within our grasp, and the song titles almost read like a list
    of the things the music could mean: ""I Can Almost See You,"" ""When the Sky Pours
    Down Like a Fountain"", ""The House Where We Grew Up"", ""Floating Away in Every
    Direction"", ""Startle the Heavens"", ""Sparkle &amp; Fade..."" Those phrases are basically
    what it sounds like.

Four nights a week, a couple of hours a night, the most isolated, provincial pop-daft pup could be initiated into the strange ways of Beefheart and the Fall, Leadbelly and Lee Perry, Huggy Bear and the Bhundu Boys. There were the famous alumni (Syd, Marc, Rod, sundry caterwauling punks), the eternally zen art teacher (Ivor Cutler), a cantankerous old caretaker (Mark E. Smith), and an endless fresh intake of shambling chancers and future superstars, all benignly presided over by the tireless Peel himself. And if there were a headboy, well, Jarvis Cocker may have been it.</p><p>
    Because, more than most, Cocker came to embody the spirit of the show. As he writes in his affectionate sleevenotes to this new compendium of sessions, the Peel Show changed his life, saved his life, and very nearly wrecked his life. Indeed, the most intriguing track on these two discs might be the brief silence between ""Refuse to Be Blind""-- the last Martin Hannett-y spasm of adolescent anguish from their first session-- and ""Pink Glove"" from their second, the first sign of their triumphant transformation into authentic, poised pop artists. Those two seconds elide 12 lost years of misfires, mishaps, and misadventures, during which Cocker admits ""there were times when I did secretly curse John Peel for encouraging me to turn my back on the straight and narrow."" I imagine those anticlimactic years provided the inspiration for one of Cocker's finest songs: ""1st Man in Space"" (performed by Phil Oakey for the All Seeing I in 1999), which tells the story of Sheffield's first astronaut, returning to Earth expecting life-changing acclaim, but finding only lonely indifference: ""Why does no one want to know what I saw?""</p><p>
    The inclusion of that first session, recorded in 1981 when Cocker was still at school, makes this a more dramatically satisfying take on the long and winding Pulp story than 2002's perfunctory, underperforming <em>Hits</em> collection. The four songs reveal a school band enthusiastically casting around for any style that might work-- from jangle-pop on ""Turkey Mambo Mamma"" to Joy Division on ""Refuse to Be Blind"". But even here you can hear, in the unmistakable grain of Cocker's voice, the germ of the performer he was to become. In the Cure-like lullaby ""Wishful Thinking"" he chastely sings ""she turned me on,"" and you hear the first steps toward the epic balladeer of erotic desperation. And on the toytown ""Please Don't Worry"", he's already a deadpan comedian of Northern hedonism and hypocrisy.
    </p><p>
    Jump-cut a decade to February 1993 and Pulp have finally, majestically hit their stride. Maybe Cocker had to chance upon the magically correct combination of musicians, maybe he needed to get out of Sheffield, perhaps he had to get his heart and legs broken, or maybe he simply had to wait for Morrissey to get out his way. But the release of ""Babies"" finally won an audience for his group's perversely stylish, stylophonic dramas of council-estate lust and high-rise horror, and with ""Pink Glove"", ""You're a Nightmare"", and ""Acrylic Afternoons"" Pulp were on a roll, waking refreshed from the bad dream of history, relishing in seedy seductions, and casting a fine eye over the kitsch and stink of the long 1970s of British soul.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, you could hardly imagine, even newly signed to Island, that they might be genuine contenders. Even as Blur and Suede kicked off the first rumblings of Britpop, Pulp seemed too exquisitely perverse, too much the eternal outsiders to really chime with the times. Yet for their next session, recorded September 1994, the group are previewing songs that would end up on the chart-busting <em>Different Class</em>, Cocker's field notes from the ripped backsides of the capitol: ""Underwear"", ""Pencil Skirt"", and, still finding its feet, unsure of whether it's a throwaway novelty or scathing era-defining anthem, ""Common People"".
    </p>
<p>
    Appropriately enough, there's another interlude right here, a seven-year gap while Pulp left the shadowlands of Peel, went pop, went tabloid, and went round the bend. When they finally return in August 2001, it's as a kind of rehab, with selections from <em>We Love Life</em> (including the terrific, ambitious ""Weeds""), and a previously unreleased song, ""Duck Diving"". It's one of Cocker's meandering, spoken-word reveries, telling of a childhood swimming expedition. You could also read it as another one of his curious allegories of the vagaries of pop: He dives to the dangerous depths of the pond in pursuit of some prize, and for a second thinks he might not make it back up. But he resurfaces bedraggled, discovering that the sunken booty he's unearthed is simply an empty, bashed-up old biscuit tin-- which he nevertheless keeps fondly on the mantle. 
    </p>
<p>
    This is the real ending of the record. There's an additional disc of live material, including a show from October 2001 in celebration of Peel's 40 years in broadcasting, where the band embarks on a wonky cover of his beloved ""Peter Gunn"" and plays an affectionately snarky dedication of ""Help the Aged"". But it's the funny, tender, humdrum storytelling of ""Duck Diving"" that stays with you-- the laconic, lugubrious style with which Cocker unwinds his yarn. You realize that, in a way, he inherited it from Peel's rambling radio digressions. I remember thinking after Peel died, when people still thought the BBC might get a proper replacement, that Jarvis would be the ideal candidate: the nation's funny, avuncular ambassador for obnoxious noise. He was at a loose end post-Pulp, after all, and you could even imagine him relishing taking on Home Truths. Maybe if the solo career doesn't pan out, it might still happen.

While Ricardo Villalobos has always been known for crafting long, minimalist tracks, this one surely takes the cake, clocking in at 37 minutes and offering little in the way of development, surprise, or variation along the way. And though it may come as a bit of a shock, here that is not a bad thing.<br/></p><p>
    At the risk of being reductive, <em>Fizheuer Zieheuer</em> essentially consists of a lone boom-tick pattern-- so basic it might serve as the house-music chapter of a beatmakers' tutorial-- overlayed with two interlocking horn parts. One is a minor-key, mostly ostinato figure that oom-pahs almost uninterrupted for the length of the track; a trumpet solo occasionally breaks through like a ray of light through low, grey clouds. A bonus cut, ""Fizbeast"", rounds out the CD release to bring total running time to more than 72 minutes-- downloader's value alert!-- but that remix remains even more restrained. Its own interior dubscape is so minimally variegated as to be almost dizzying, like playing hopscotch on a moving sidewalk in zero gravity-- in a blizzard.</p><p>
    And yet, any minimalist will know that no mere tabulation of the elements can get at the heart of repetition, and that's certainly the case here. Working more minimally than he ever has, Villalobos finds perpetual motion in seeming stasis, using judicious filters and delay to ensure that no two bars are alike. His pinhead moonstomping is like the sonic version of micropsia, in which traditional perspective fails and objects lose their scale: echoes outgrow their sources and offbeats shadowbox their downbeats to death. And while the chorused, beer-hall horns never quite cede the center, they're occasionally threatened by a lone percussive sound that hammers away at the Two and Four: a bright, metallic ringing, it sounds uncannily like a baseball bat struck against the frame of a chain-link fence. (Ricardo goes Little League? How oddly American.) Absurd as it may be, following that one sound and its bobbleheaded echoes is one of the track's great, hypnotic pleasures.
    </p><p>
    But it's the brass that give ""Fizheuer Zieheuer"" its real power. The horns, after all, are what most people use to identify the track, and they're what leap out and grab you when you hear it in a DJ set. But the horns have also become a sticking point. I don't think anyone ever seriously believed that Villalobos himself played or even commissioned the horns, but in recent weeks this already polarizing cut-- a critical darling, it's been panned in equal measure on forums like Discogs.com, where its length has invited terms like ""pompous"" and ""pretentious""-- has become even more controversial. 
    </p>
<p>
    In late December, a Discogs.com forum member uncovered a song called ""Pobjenicki Cocek"" performed by Blehorkestar Bakija Bakic, from the Vranje region in southern Serbia, and claimed that in it lay the key to ""Fizheuer"". The following week, when the Italian blog Batteria Ricaricabile posted the song, originally released on a 1999 compilation called <em>Road of the Gypsies</em>, the extent of Villalobos' borrowing became clear. The chugging refrain is taken from a moment where Blehorkestar Bakija Bakic's song pauses and marks time; with little percussion and no lead voices to get in the way, it's ripe for looping. The bright, bold melodic passage that leads <em>Fitzheuer</em> to its dizzying heights, meanwhile, comes straight from the intro to ""Pobjednicki Cocek""-- dragged, dropped and left virtually unadulterated. ""Fitzheuer Zieheuer"", in other words, is basically a remix, if not an edit. 
    </p>
<p>
    But the great question remains: So what? Leave the copyright questions to Lawrence Lessig; ""Fitzheuer Zieheuer"" remains a force to be reckoned with, not in spite of but because of its audacity. If Villalobos hadn't released a 35-minute track under his own name, somebody would have had to do it for him; better still that he did so with this brain-bungeeing, hair-raising, tortoise-and-hare race between call and response, downbeat and delay, that livens up any DJ set like a bolt from the blue. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Fitzheuer Zieheuer"" didn't need to be 37 minutes long; Villalobos could have made exactly the same point in 18, 15, hell, 10 minutes, and nobody would have felt shortchanged. But I'm glad he did it this way; if nothing else, the track offers a window into his creative process, where production and marathon DJ sessions merge in the form of 20- or 30-minute drum tracks that he records to CDR and plays out layered with other records. I suspect that that's how ""Fitzheuer"" got its start, as a private-press thing that Playhouse decided to make public. If I have any complaint about the release, it is-- perhaps paradoxically-- that they decided to release it at all. Heard in the context of one of Villalobos' epic sets, at lord-knows o'clock and with the crowd gone completely unhinged, a track like ""Fitzheuer"" is unbelievably special; the way those horns leaven the air after too many electrohouse synths, they're like sorbet. Or better still, grappa.
    </p>
<p>
    But debated to death on the message boards, ruling the charts at Beatport, and blasted at the most inopportune moments by warm-up knobs desperate to appear au courant, the tune wears out its welcome awfully quickly; its ubiquity works against it. I'm glad that Playhouse decided to share ""Fitzheuer"" with the world; love it or hate it, the discourse it generates enriches dance music. But with file-sharing sites like YouSendIt and Sendspace making a superstar's turn at Fabric or Panoramabar accessible to all and sundry, I wonder if Villalobos' private-press product needed to be taken public at all. Leaked online, it would have generated all the intrigue and rumor that it has anyway, and spared the overly public airing, it might have retained an air of mystery. Or maybe it's just disappointing knowing where the song comes from: No one really wants to find their Holy Grail, especially so soon after even being tipped off as to its very existence.

What this meant in the past was confrontational songs with obnoxious titles that lived up to a tenet of Smith's philosophy-- ""the more exalted one's intent, the more insipid the moniker should be."" What this means for <em>Noon to Eternity</em> is a confrontational album that's surprisingly approachable.</p><p>
    This latest collection of exaltations from TLASILA isn't any less confrontational than works of the past-- <em>Noon and Eternity</em> consists of four tracks, none shorter than nine minutes, with two of them taking up two-thirds of the album's total running time. If you're looking for that 70s glam vibe, you'd be better off hitting yourself in the head with Mott the Hoople records. The other reference points mentioned above, however, are all over this thing. The music-- swampy, slow, queasy-- hearkens back to the nascent days of no wave, with Smith's lugubrious vocals not dissimilar to Arto Lindsay's hoarse whispers. Good luck picking out the words, though-- no doubt Tom Smith means what he says, but he's not going to actually come out and just say it. There are a few repeated key phrases that stick out-- ""this home and fear,"" ""mass graves are found last year""-- that, coupled with the bronze soldier on the album's cover, hint at a very topical theme. But Smith does his best to make these cogent fragments unrecognizable, strangling the syllables as they slither through the band's tribal cacophony. Even the snippets of sampled dialog get lost amidst the meditative clanging and chiming and bursts of static.</p><p>
    In 2002, Pitchfork's Jason Nickey gave TLASILA's <em>The Wigmaker in Eighteenth-Century Williamsburg</em> the sort of backhanded praise that belies a begrudging respect: ""If I ever put this double-disc set on again it's because I'm playing it for a curious friend, or I've sunk so deep into a bout with self-loathing that I want to cause irreparable damage to my nervous system."" In contrast, <em>Noon</em> is almost an album of gentle ambiance (in a slasher flick fashion). Smith, in conjunction with bandmates/not-so-strange bedfellows Don Fleming and Andrew WK, produce a mix that makes this difficult racket easy on the ears, while not compromising the intent of the music. ""Mothers Over Silverpoint"" transitions from the expected crashing racket to a softer wash of noise that would make Goblin fanboys (like Zombi) extremely jealous. When ""This Home And Fear"" switches from queasy soundscape to ur-rock rave-up, the transition between these states jars the listener gently. And perhaps this is this album's most remarkable trick-- it's a mess of noise that isn't all that noisy.</p></div>"|9799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9799-noon-eternity/|8.0|David Raposa

    Scotland's Aereogramme has always purported a metal/punk/emo identity crisis
    with flair, but on the follow-up to their beautiful EP <em>Seclusion</em>, the
    conviction behind their mood swings has itself gone diffident. This LP has its
    corseted moments of elegance totaling about two and a half tracks, but the
    verbosity of the title is a premonition of what's filling in the gaps. The
    majority of <em>Heart</em> is a sulky melting pot of all the elements we admire
    of this group. In between the whines and montages, they wedge themselves nicely
    into their own respectably mixed-up genre. But for the first time, there is an
    affectation for which there appears to be no balance of virtuosity.</p><p>
    The twinkling guitars and smoke-and-mirrors drum thumps of tracks like
    ""Trenches"" and ""Nightmares"" are paired with washes of
    lyrical melodrama that get lost in the tantrum. Long, repeated phrases like
    ""I love you but I can't let you go"" and ""My head is caving
    in"" are drowned by the lachrymose thunderstorm of drum, string, and bass
    raining down on pretty much the entire album. There are too many special
    effects surrounding the messages-- Craig B's penchant for preadolescent vocals
    included. Most of the time it's hard to feel anything but ornery, as a
    full-grown person being swaddled by an overbearing mother (or boyfriend).</p><p>
    There is a sense that even diehard fans will find something amiss here:
    loudest moments too depressive, quiet moments too timid. The guitar and violin
    phrasing on opener ""Conscious Life for Coma Boy"" are uninspired, with
    a stifling range and underdeveloped melody. It's nothing like previous
    openers-- the abrasive punk of <em>Sleep and Release</em>'s ""Indiscretion
    #243"" or <em>Seclusion</em>'s triumphant ""Inkwell"". Scattered
    songs are increasingly opaque shades of the same: the percussive strings on
    ""Finding A Light"", or the stock piano round of ""Barriers"",
    both of which fail to lure. The production here is cleaner, giving the soft
    instrumentation and happy major keys ample room to breathe. But it was the
    muddled, invasive and sinister quality of the band's last two releases that
    finessed a hodgepodge to such delightful effect. 
    </p>
    What
    the band can still do with delicacy is, perhaps, all the more worth noting.
    ""Exits"" also refrains from the winding, explorative melodies of yore,
    but the descending three-note piano loop, its echo in the electric guitar, and
    the primer of a string section are something even great cynics will find
    inescapably lovely. Late entry ""The Running Man"", with its dripping,
    urgent synth line and boundless, atmospheric bass, is original and highly
    addictive. Together with ""Exits"", it's the heart and soul of the
    album, the impervious voice in a crowd of pomp and fluff.</div>"|9779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9779-my-heart-has-a-wish-that-you-would-not-go/|5.9|Liz Colville

    ""People"" is a pretty good example of what turns some off from
    Animal Collective. The whole song is just a repeating guitar line, a held
    chord, some squiggly percussion, and Avey Tare doing a little self-stim call-and-response,
    alternating ""Yeah, ye-AH"" with the equally profound ""Yeah,
    YE-ah"". Oh, and screaming ""People!!!"" at
    throat-shredding volume through a distortion pedal every few bars, followed by
    a banshee wail that echoes between the speakers via a crude delay. And that's
    about it. Add to this the usual speculation about the sincerity of a young
    pack of art-rockers based in Brooklyn, and it's not hard to imagine large
    swaths of indie music fans moving on to something else.</p><p>
    Here's the thing though: ""People"" is also a good example of what
    turns the rest of us on to Animal Collective. I'm hearing a horizontal piece of
    music, built from a single idea that takes its time to explore the (admittedly
    limited) possibilities of its premise, and then moves on. And the peaks are
    thrilling; with sufficient volume this thing induces the sort of satisfying
    bliss only possible through well-executed drone rock. The song doesn't <em>mean</em>
    anything, of course, and I'm sure it wasn't difficult to make, but none of that
    matters: It still sounds damn good while managing to transport me to a very
    specific place. Animal Collective thinks enough of ""People"" to
    include an additional live version at the end of this four-song EP, a track
    with a bit less power and focus that nonetheless suggests how well the song
    could blend into a show. Its recording date indicates that they've been playing
    it live for close to two years, meaning it's incubated long enough to get it onto a record.</p><p>
    As far as the other two songs here, ""Tikwid"" is a sweet, slightly
    twisted ballad very much in the vein of <em>Feels</em>, specifically echoing bits
    of ""Grass"" with its sing-songy melody. It's almost good enough to
    work on that record, actually, becoming even more appealing during its soaring
    wordless section where Avey Tare airs out his falsetto and cuts the sunny
    warmth with odd vocal effects. Speaking of which, vocal effects are the sole
    focus of the two-minute snippet ""My Favorite Colors"". Here the
    Collective channels their barnyard brethren, wrapping their exaggerated
    vibratos around a wisp of tinkly piano to sound like Ethel Merman slurring her way through a version of ""Old MacDonald"". It's
    an ultimately inconsequential track deservedly fated to round out a stopgap EP,
    but it's another example of something that Animal Collective fans are likely to
    find interesting, while most of humanity lurches for the skip button.

The band released only two proper albums during a decade-long run-- 1999's <i>American Nervoso</i> and 2000's <i>We Are the Romans</i>-- but left a large legacy. Contemporaries (Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, Isis) and descendents (Norma Jean, Every Time I Die) have borrowed from Botch's hybridized hardcore.  Botch members have also kept the torch lit, continuing to shred in These Arms are Snakes, Minus the Bear, and Roy.</p>
<p>Given that impact, one might expect Botch's music to sound bracingly unique. But even its most ambitious work is full of recognizable influences, from Helmet and the Unsane to Metallica and Black Sabbath. This is truest of the early material, which <i>Unifying Themes Redux</i> compiles from 7"" tracks, comp appearances, and demos. (It's the first in Hydra Head's Botch reissue series; expanded versions of <i>American Nervoso</i> and <i>We Are the Romans</i> are due later this year).</p>
<p>Since Botch clung tightly to its influences, the achievements here are subtle. Much of <i>Unifying Themes Redux</i> is straight-up, high-octane hard rock, with minor glimpses of the complex structures that would mark the group's later years. Here, simple energy and volume easily distinguish Botch's music.</p>
<p>The key is the guitar playing of David Knudson. His tone is sharply metallic  yet openly noisy, both cutting through and washing over the band's frantic mix. On ""God vs. Science"", his biting chords pound and jangle, while on the slamming ""Closure"", his seesawing noise leaves smoldering trails. Yet Knudson doesn't merely spray notes onto his band's canvas: On ""Ebb"", he rhymes with Brian Cook's stark bass and Dave Verellen's metronomic screams.</p>
<p>Verellen's voice is perhaps the one stumbling block on the road to Botch appreciation. When his throat-ripping howl works, it folds into the surrounding noise like wind chimes thrashed by a tornado. But his range is narrow, and when the music crosses into melodrama, he becomes a cartoon. A cover of Carl Orff's ""O Fortuna"" (from the opera <i>Carmina Burana</i>) sounds like an unintentional joke, and ""Stupid Me""'s chant of ""I'm not gonna stand for this anymore"" makes the teen-angst clichés of Suicidal Tendencies' ""Institutionalized"" seem profound.  In fact, that tendency toward the dramatic is the band's only significant flaw, at times approaching laughable bombast.</p>
<p>Such over-seriousness melted away in concert-- at least judging by <i>061502</i>, a CD/DVD package containing the band's final performance from 2002. Here, grainy, frantically cut footage captures Botch's energy perfectly. Latter day classics like the right-angled ""John Woo"" and the anthemic ""Frequency Ass Bandit"" sound great when caked in sweaty concert grime, and even the band's caffeinated cover of the B-52's ""Rock Lobster"" (rendered awkwardly on <i>Unifying Themes Redux</i>) flames up nicely in the live setting.</p>
<p>Over 70 minutes, this set gets wearying. But if you feel your eyelids closing, switch to the band's DVD commentary track, where self-deprecating humor and the sounds of beer cans opening offer welcome relief. It also gives a hint as to why Botch's music works so well: As complex as they could get, these four always had fun.</p></div>"|11895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11895-unifying-themes-redux-061502/|7.1|Marc Masters

No slight intended to his ""day job"": Pinback are where they are because they're consistent and throw very few curveballs. Fans know what to expect; critics know what to say.</p><p>
    Likewise, <em></em><em>Living Well</em> is remarkably consistent, carries plenty of commonalities with Crow's best-known project, and bears purchase if you own more than one Pinback record. Should you have never loved Pinback (if maybe you loved the quirk of his earlier projects), this record will probably leave you cold as well. Crow's worked well in many other contexts-- notably the Ladies-- because he's a remarkably talented but pop-minded and un-showy musician, and he's got that voice. On cluttered and quirky early records and side projects built on left-turns and showmanship, it's a beacon for a listener. On the pristine, nearly mathematical precision pop of Pinback, it can get a little vanilla. It's no surprise that, by himself and without a gimmick, he's made a pretty straightforward guitar pop record.</p><p>
    Straightforward doesn't necessarily mean dull, however. Nothing on <em></em><em>Living Well</em> will blow your mind, but there are several great songs and always a few details to hold your interest through the lesser moments. Crow plays every instrument here, with only occasional drums, and mostly loops and drum machines. ""Bam Bam"" (recorded too soon to be a tribute to late wrestler Scott ""Bam Bam"" Bigelow, alas), is a sparse guitar-and-voice arrangement that adds a galloping banjo in its final moments. ""Over Your Heart"" boasts a nearly imperceptible shift in key and rhythm, making it a serviceable pop song in passing, but more rewarding with closer attention. Even the tepid chug of ""Burns"" has a leaky-tire hiss and a few electronic bells and whistles, tastefully deployed to add atmosphere to what's essentially a demo throwaway. These small touches are the mark of a musician who gets bored easily, but doesn't forget his audience.
    </p><p>
    To be honest, the tracks with real drums might be less rewarding, like the jangly ""Leveling"" that's introduced by some infant gurgling, or the aimless strum of ""Chucked"". Maybe that's due to the front-loaded nature of the disc, as the smoothness of early tracks like ""Taste"" and ""Up"" are hard to deny, but the charm wears a little thin in later tracks that try too hard, like the forced gypsy-march tune ""Liefeld"" or the zombie-shuffle ""Ring"" (though there's some fun vocal manipulations near the end of that one).
    </p>
<p>
    Crow's not nearly as prolific as, say, Robert Pollard, but there are similarities: brevity, for one, as ""I Hate You, Rob Crow"" could be the catchiest 1:13 in the man's catalog (hilariously, the ""single version"" at the end of the record is significantly longer). And while Crow's output is a molehill to Pollard's mountain, they're both prolific, not afraid of collaboration, and always identifiable despite the new contexts they may try to shoehorn themselves into (like Goblin Cock). He may have some far less-cohesive solo records behind him, but thus far, Crow's more consistent than not, and he's maintained that ratio through all of his extracurricular projects. <em></em><em>Living Well</em> is a testament to that. The unpretentious photos of Crow in the cover and liners, chilling out in a fine black metal tee and posing with babies and pumpkins, is enough to let you know that this is a laid-back affair. Is Rob in a Mellow Mood occasionally predictable? Sure, but there's nothing promised here that isn't delivered on, no premise underachieved. It's exactly what you'd expect, and that shouldn't be a problem with anybody who's followed him through the years. As long as he keeps Zach Hill's number in his phone, it's not a problem with me, either.

That notion remained latent until the late 1990s, however, when Wyclef Jean was temporarily established as the Clinton-era cultural symbol of cross-cultural (read: black and white) unity. Not for a lack of trying, but Jean never managed to release a <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em> or <em>Burnin'</em>, and was eclipsed during the Bush era by the much less-threatening Bono.</p><p>
    The desire for another Marley or Wonder remains strong, as evidenced by the success of <em>Joyful Rebellion</em>, the 2004 genre-blending sophomore album from Toronto's K-Os. <em>Rebellion</em> went platinum in Canada and received just about every plaudit afforded by that country's popular culture industry, including the prestigious Juno Award. The favorable commercial reaction, however, led to introspection, and the introspection led to the follow-up album about the misunderstood superstar. True to its highfalutin title, <em>Atlantis: Hymns for Disco</em> is a conceptual piece, a melodious corrective to two-plus years of ostensible media falsities about its author. In this light, <em>Atlantis</em> resembles De La Soul's sophomore detour <em>De La Soul Is Dead</em>, on which the MTV darlings and granola-rap progenitors attempted to shed the D.A.I.S.Y. Age warmup gear and make an early-career three-point turn. Yet while <em>De La Soul Is Dead</em> showcased the trio's newfound industry-related bitterness, on <em>Atlantis</em>, K-Os goes in the other direction; regressing further into hippiedom, and neglecting to answer his critics in lieu of spiritual posturing.  Consequently, <em>Atlantis</em> rebuts with more of the same; a fact expressed clearly on the contradictory chorus of ""Flypaper"": ""I'm not one to repeat myself, but if it ain't broken, don't fix it.""<br/></p><p>
    Not necessarily fixed as much as dulled is K-Os' controversial approach to rap and hip-hop culture. <em>Rebellion</em> was widely criticized for its fire-and-brimstone arrogance about the current state of rap, especially on album opener ""Emcee Murdah"", which featured the lyric ""hip hop's not dead, it's the mind of the MC."" K-Os' response to the controversy is relegated to an untitled interstitial track halfway through the album. Over a beatboxed backdrop, he creates an imagined scenario designed to deflate his critics: ""This kid rolled up, and said, 'What's up with Emcee Murdah?' That was then son, this is now; I live in the moment, like a why to a how."" This sort of wishy-washy sloganeering as response is more PR blurb than battle rap, and is evident of K-Os' larger, unfortunate motivation with <em>Atlantis</em>: hovering around meaningful discourse, but subsuming it to quasi-spiritual, New Age mumbo-jumbo.
    </p><p>
    Throughout <em>Atlantis</em>, rap is present, but reduced to the level of signifier-- of K-Os' interpretive talents. His didactic fondness for rap's canonized first decade starts with opening track ""Electrik Heat-- The Seekwill"", where, over an interpolation of the Galactic Force Band drum fill that made ""It Takes Two"" a number one song in 1988, he specifically cites Chuck D, Rakim, and Nas. The reference to Nas' ""The World Is Yours"", in the form of a crooned coda, thoroughly launders the titular phrase of its original potency, re-imagining it as a tag line of spiritual reinvention. While his positions aren't as orthodox as on <em>Rebellion</em>, it remains evident that even golden-era rap needs thorough generic recontextualization to maintain relevance.
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, <em>Atlantis</em> strives for a patchwork cohesiveness, with equal parts neo-soul, reggae, rap, and rock, bound by a vaguely spiritual message and partially elaborated water-related extended metaphor. K-Os' interpretive acumen is present throughout: The neo-soul song about overcoming personal strife (""The Rain""), the Power Music/Electric Revival number about redemption (""Sunday Morning""), the pop-dub experiement (""Mirror in the Sky""), and the Bloc Party song (""Born to Run"") are all evidence of his talent. K-Os is unsatisfied to let them stand as simple genre pieces, though-- his consistent infusion of Meaning into every second of the record reduces them to components of a larger concept that never quite reveals itself.
    </p>
<p>
    ""I'm trying to be unapologetic about the rules I break,"" K-Os claims on his website, before explaining that ""most revolutionary art ends up provoking classic ideals and it is these same classic ideals that become prisons if they go unchallenged."" While not clearing up the jumbled messages of <em>Atlantis</em>, this quote underscores its central contradiction, and the most troubling aspect of K-Os' public persona: the friction between progressive ambition and conservative output. Unfortunately, it's an issue that K-Os recognizes, but sees no need to resolve.<br/>

To understand why a musician as talented as Rosenvinge, who has a knack for evocative ice-melt arrangements and striking textural vocals, would squander that talent on some of the non-events that pepper this album, we might look to her origins.</p><p>
    Indie fans probably know Rosenvinge from her trio of Smells Like Records LPs and her collaborations with Lee Ranaldo, who lends guitar and backing vocals to a couple of tracks on <em>Continental 62</em>. But she's been active in music since the 1980s, when she was half of the tart-pop duo Alex y Cristina, who were stadium-packing mainstream stars in the Spanish-speaking world. In the early 1990s, Rosenvinge left the group and began to explore more sophisticated, idiosyncratic fare as a Spanish-language solo artist, then switched to English-language U.S. releases around the turn of the century. Imagine that you're a musician with heady aspirations who spent the 80s spinning sugar for television audiences in the most outrageous blonde bangs imaginable (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MStVpvhX5IM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>seriously</u></a>):  Mightn't you go to any lengths to distance yourself from this persona? I'd probably write a few boring songs too, just to make a point.</p><p>
    Of course, this is pure speculation, and it's equally possible that Rosenvinge's muse is just finicky. <em>Continental 62</em> is most successful when she uses stately dream pop as a baseline, contrasting it with unexpected textures and tangents, rather than an ultimate end; the four tracks that privilege inventive songwriting over hazy atmosphere are the best. The title track's creeping, solitary piano and cooing vocals move through three distinct phases of emphasis, unlike the weaker songs' equivocal drift; contrasts occur as crisp edges surface from and subside beneath the blue blur of her voice. Album standout ""White Hole"" is distinguished by its frosty yet lively vocals, slashing rock bridge, and the inspired, Life Without Buildings-ish onomatopoeia that precedes the chorus. On ""A Liar to Love"", Rosenvinge trades her ice princess routine for a naturalistic singing style that's well suited to the song's spry lilt, evoking the liquid cool of Stereolab or Georgia Hubley. And on the Spanish-language song ""Tok Tok"", Rosenvinge's voice directly engages with the terse textural elements seething beneath it, rather than drifting amid them, similar to Under Byen's broken clockwork sprawl.
    </p><p>
    The album's other six tracks aren't bad; they just don't have the substance to recommend repeated listening. On ""Window"", with its mincing vocals and tinkling music box accompaniment, Rosenvinge draws pretty pictures but neglects to animate them. ""Jelly"" drags with an unappealing blend of seriousness and preciousness permeating Rosenvinge's monochromatic warble, and ""Helicopter Song"" is very similar. Meanwhile, ""Teclas Negras"" is like a Spanish version of the title track with less dynamic melodic phrasing.  In its entirety, <em>Continental 62</em> is fine for background music. But the substantial number of moments when it vividly leaps into the foreground makes one wish, on the main, for more sound effects and fewer affected sounds.

    The breakup album is a familiar pop music trope-- countless artists have harnessed the emotional fallout of a relationship to fuel their songwriting efforts. The less imaginative practitioners wind up churning out acoustic self-pity or overdriven spite and angst, while the most effective have draped heartbreak in a clever disguise (like the high-gloss domestic dispute of Fleetwood Mac's <em>Rumours</em>), or rendered personal pain as the most important event in human history (like the symphonic catharsis of ABC's <em>The Lexicon of Love</em>).</p><p>
    Despite a soft spot for concept albums, Of Montreal would seem an unlikely participant in this arena, having spent much of their career eschewing confessional introspection for escapist fantasy.  Even amidst the notebook-doodle psychedelia society of Elephant 6, Kevin Barnes and his compatriots stood apart for their day-glo Nickelodeon world, full of bizarre characters with alliterative names and toy-box, sugar-high arrangements.  While there's always been a dark streak running through Of Montreal's cartoon universe-- and Barnes' chipmunk-shrill voice sometimes tips disturbingly from childlike to desperate-- few would look to the Athens, Geo., band to accurately depict love's gory aftermath.</p><p>
    Yet in the past year, storm clouds have intruded upon the band's rainbow domain as Barnes went through a separation (he and his wife have since reconciled); concurrently, the band's sound has been slowly molting off the giddy pop of its early days, using its past couple of albums to test the waters of a more sinister combination of synth-pop and glam without abandoning its steakhouse jingle-worthy melodies.  These two plot threads intertwine at <em>Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</em>, an astonishingly good late-period record from Of Montreal that's as uncomfortably savage in its depiction of breakup psychology as it is relentlessly catchy.  </p><p>
    The emotional accuracy of the record lies in Of Montreal's unwillingness, or perhaps inability, to settle for ""woe is me"" moping.  Barnes resists the urge to cry into an acoustic guitar, instead portraying the full-spectrum manic mood-swings of the brokenhearted: desperately seeking distraction in drugs or religion, imagining himself as a cynical-minded lothario, and even considering violence.  When Barnes does directly give in to his despair, it produces the monolithic 12-minute centerpiece of ""The Past Is a Grotesque Animal"", a gutwrenching soundtrack provided by an unrelenting bassline and a synth solo that sounds like an angry flying saucer.</p><p>
    The rest of <em>Hissing Fauna</em> is an endless supply of off-kilter but instantly appealing melodies intact over the band's newly robotic sound.  The focus throughout is on mechanized rhythms and synthesizer swirls, though the tempos are no less hyperactive, and the attention span of the arrangements is only a shade longer.  Occasionally, the bright synthesizers appear to mock Barnes' shadowy feelings, like the roller-skate organ riff that flits about the pleading drug-use of ""Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse"", or the Christmas carol exterior of depression saga ""A Sentence of Sorts in Kongsvinger"".</p><p>
    Of Montreal's full embrace of this new sound works best in the record's second half, as after the soul-purge of ""The Past Is a Grotesque Animal"", Barnes tries to slut away the pain through a series of sex jams no less memorable for being completely unconvincing.  ""Bunny Ain't No Kind of Rider"" finds the singer sauntering through the club brushing off sexual advances from both women and men and boasting of ""soul power,"" while ""Faberge Falls for Shuggie"" struts over a bassline funkier than I ever could have imagined the group capable of producing.  Throughout, Barnes multi-tracks several lascivious voices, making bizarre double entendres out of parachutes and interiors. It's not the direction many of their fans might've imagined they'd take, but it's that very attribute that makes it so ceaselessly fascinating and inexhaustibly replayable.<br/>

Unfazed by the Misfits having beat them to the ""our box set comes in a tiny coffin"" trick, Rhino have wrapped this 3xCD/DVD set in something the average goth is more likely to have actually been inside-- lace-up faux leather-- and slipped in a 58-page book full of some pretty entertaining stuff: pictures, song-by-song notes, essays, some cheeky ""How to Dance Goth"" instructions, and quotes from musicians either reminiscing about the 1980s or complaining about being included because they were NOT GOTH dammit SHUT UP. (The Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie: ""I was way too fat to be a fucking goth!"") No one will get very far into this music without a pretty intuitive sense of that tone-- the mix of devotion and affectionate parody, the ability to laugh over something's absurdity and still be (ahem) dead serious about it.</p><p>
    Because no matter how many Florida teenagers thought they were actually vampires, the fact is that goth-- a form of dance music-- has always been more fun than scary. Case in point, maybe: Alien Sex Fiend's ""Now I'm Feeling Zombified"". Forget capes and corsets-- this little legend is nine minutes of chintzy, acidic squelching, motoring angrily along with a frontman who makes Marilyn Manson look like Tony Bennett. The wonder of the thing is that it's a treat no matter which way you come at it: On one level, it's grim, cathartic, and a blast for dancing; on another, it's just fun to sing along in ridiculous cretinous-monster voices. And oddly enough, it's that same appreciation of the ridiculous that can get you through some of the bands that took their drama seriously-- the stadium goth-rock bands scattered through these discs, bands whose punk-meets-glam drama finds its next of kin in... well, hair metal, another 1980s genre that's dated pretty strangely. (If you don't believe me-- or the Cult-- just watch the Mission (UK) video on the DVD, which looks and sounds like psychedelic bikers have taken over Def Leppard.) Even the worst of the music here tends to be fascinatingly novel: No matter how many preening goth-influenced bands make their way onto modern-day radio, this stuff feels a world away from us.</p><p>
    Why? Because while we all give ""goth"" credit as an abstract notion-- a quality and style that's become one of the main pillars of the rock world-- we tend not to think much about the bands that really codified it, and even less about how its <em>musical</em> influence has worked out. Twenty years later, the compilers of this set have actually done a terrific job of tracing those things, especially considering how vague and malleable the word ""goth"" has gotten over the years. And while no one's pretending the world hasn't seen a lot of goth bands with, in Bauhaus guitarist Daniel Ash's words, ""too much makeup and no talent,"" the selections in this box wind up making a great case for two things: The damned high quality of a lot of forgotten first-wave goth, and the sheer verve, insanity, and creativity of some of its musicians.
    </p><p>
    They start with familiar classics from the bands who turned out to be goth's godfathers-- Joy Division, the Cure, Bauhaus, Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees-- but the heart of the thing remains England's 1980s goth heyday, where the urge to dance comes out in grim, grinding, relentless music for the fake undead: Look to the Sisters of Mercy's steamroller ""Temple of Love"", or Tones on Tail's ""Christian Says"". They sprinkle in darker tracks from the pop bands who filled out goths' record collections: Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, the Cocteau Twins, the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain. They follow the aesthetic as it comes to North America (Christian Death), reunites with punk (the Misfits), meets up with <em>electronic</em> dance music (Skinny Puppy), and starts to become ""industrial"" (Ministry), and then they glance back at the acts who were the godfathers of <em>that</em> (Throbbing Gristle, Einstürzende Neubauten). They stop in on the kind of arty, spooky goth that was more likely to have women singing (Dead Can Dance, Miranda Sex Garden), and close off with a nice past-meets-future moment: Modern-day band AFI covering the Cure's ""The Hanging Garden"".
    </p>
<p>
    Within all that is a rich vein of terrific pop music, from bands whose more over-the-top impulses seem-- 20 years down the road-- less silly and more brilliantly daring. Between the steady, clanging beat and the dark energy they're working to summon, the best of them genuinely shred: See Red Lorry Yellow Lorry's ""Walking on Your Hands"", which channels Joy Division for people who wish they'd rocked steadier. It's just as striking to sort through how much these bands contributed to the sound of modern music, with their cavernous, trebly productions helping pioneer the whole use of hard, ugly sound-- every time you love a track for how happily brutal it is, some small credit is owed in goth's direction. (Some acts here take that to bold extremes; the most notable example comes from 1991: Daniel Ash's ""Coming Down"" is 12-bar blues, only tinny and echoing and with the most curdled vocal treatment possible.) There are also plenty of reminders of goth's other side, the atmospheric, psychedelic spook that descended from Joy Division and the Cure.
    </p>
<p>
    Spend enough time with this box, and it just might turn you into a closet goth. The timing is perfect, too, and not just because My Chemical Romance sell lots of records. Some songs have a nervy energy that reflects against today's dance-rock; some have a ludicrous screech that reflects against today's noise bands. And all of it-- the spooky atmospheres, metallic productions, keening voices, dark drama-- has more than a little in common with this site's favorite record of last year, the Knife's <em>Silent Shout</em>. Best of all, it's the rare box set a person can buy to sink into a world that-- unless you've been a serious goth all along-- feels alien and new: These acts have been stuck in the goth ghetto so long that you might be amazed how much they have in common with their better-remembered peers.

<em>Coastal</em> isn't an obviously appropriate name for the second solo album from David Daniell. It's a name better suited for a release from San Agustin, the improvisational Atlanta trio in which Daniell plays electric guitar. San Agustin's music has always been tidal-- waves of cymbals and steel-wound strings stirring into major and minor crests. But <em>Coastal</em> is, all told, an album for solo electronics, and electronic music isn't generally associated with such naturalist, organic modifiers. Though Daniell plays drums, pedal steel guitar, and dulcimer here-- and borrows violin from Erin Boyette-- this is, for all intents, a pedals-and-processors album on which simple sources are electronically bent into anomalous but congruent layers and drones.</p><p>
    But <em>Coastal</em> doesn't abide by customs; instead, its creator aims to reshape-- temporarily, at least-- his audience’s sense of hearing. Indeed, like some of his best experimental and electronic forbearers, Daniell submits everything on <em>Coastal</em> to a litany of effects pedals and software patches: Sounds stick, bounce, rattle, reverberate, get lost, amplified, shifted, and scrambled, and, eventually, they aggregate into their own world.</p><p>
    It's Daniell's holistic, rearranged perception that stares one of experimental music's biggest misconceptions down without flinching: Beautiful and ugly are often treated as mutually exclusive. Steve Reich's <em>Pendulum Music</em> and Alvin Lucier's <em>Still and Moving Lines of Silence in Families of Hyperbolas: Part III, Number 11</em> (released on Daniell's Antiopic label) pressure the same common knowledge, but Daniell resumes the argument again for most of <em>Coastal</em>'s 58 minutes.
    </p>
<p>
    There's something defiantly ambivalent about his tones, be it the piercing upper register or the thick waveforms of the bass quaking through ""Palmetto"". Over that track's 27 minutes, Daniell showcases a refined sense of pacing, stacking pure drones and corroded waves to build explosive roars or complete silence. It's as edgy as his upper-register squalls, which glow, their harsh presence almost comforting. But that bass pulse-- very low but entirely approachable-- skips in a nearly sinister way, a familiar tone dialing into unsettling patterns. Daniell treats the character of his sounds not as a dualism but instead on a wide gradient, allowing specific elements to come together.
    </p>
<p>
    Even ""Sunfish"", an eight-minute track built around acoustic guitar, challenges the notion. An acoustic guitar, one supposes, is pastoral and tranquil. And it starts that way, Bert Jansch phrases suspending themselves in a humid matrix. By the time Daniell finishes wrapping acoustic arpeggios and melodies around the basic structure, his original slides sound like a beautiful mess. And maybe that's the nature of the whole coast, anyway: You jump in or walk away. Either way, things are going to be interesting.<br/>

    On the cover of Rachid Taha's 1998 album <em>Diwan</em>, the singer's caught
    in the throes of ecstasy, his head tossed back and his shaggy hair arching
    through the air. His eyes are closed and he's smiling. He's wearing a
    shimmering red shirt. He could be dancing on stage, or maybe even at a party.</p><p>
    The cover of Taha's belated sequel <em>Diwan 2</em> features the singer somber
    and unsmiling. He's wearing a rumpled suit. He's bearded, and a carefully
    wrapped turban covers his hair. His eyes are cold, hard, tired. He could be at
    a funeral.</p><p>
    To say Taha straddles two different cultures would be an understatement. In
    Algeria or even France (his home in exile) he's a Molotov cocktail firebrand, a
    populist punk with his ear to the streets. In the Western realm, he's relegated
    to the nebulous ""world music"" gulag. On one hand, he's as
    cosmopolitan a pop star as they come, an international figure on the Rai scene
    of nearly unrivaled popularity. On the other, to much of the world, he's an
    Arab first and foremost-- a ""person of interest,"" as it were-- whose
    appearance supplants his considerable talents as a singer, writer, and
    performer. 
    </p>
<p>
    Taha's always been a little pissed off and politically outspoken, but the
    timing of <em>Diwan 2</em> clearly relates to current events. Just as 2004's <em>Tékitoi</em>
    reclaimed the Arabic melodic underpinnings of the Clash's ""Rock the
    Casbah"" (notoriously blasted by U.S. troops during raids in Baghdad), <em>Diwan
    2</em> proudly embraces traditional North African music when said music arguably
    signifies more than ever before, albeit often cast through Taha's distinctly
    modernist, polyglot spectrum. 
    </p>
<p>
    And yet, at a time that calls for anger and outrage, the subjects of the
    songs on <em>Diwan 2</em>-- mostly covers from the likes of formative Taha
    influences Blaoui Houari and Dahmane El Harrachi, sung primarily in Arabic and
    French-- tackle the more universal themes of love and loneliness. It's the
    timeless soundtrack of exile, given Taha's and longtime co-conspirator Steve
    Hillage's distinctly modern interpretations, rife with traditional
    instrumentation and ancient melodies but never shirking its commitment to
    contemporary pop. 
    </p>
<p>
    That means the programmed dance beats pulsing beneath songs such as
    ""Rani"" and ""Mataouel Dellil"" are less contrivances than
    an emphasis of implied or subtle rhythmic elements already inherent to the songs.
    Even as recorded here, ""Kifache Rah"" could be 50 years old, but it's
    hard to imagine anyone sitting completely still through the song, either then
    or now. 
    </p>
<p>
    For that matter, two Taha originals, ""Josephine"" and ""Ah Mon
    Amour"" (prominently featuring Kadi Bouguenaya's wheezing, oddly funky reed
    flute), fit seamlessly among the other tracks on the album, both musically and
    thematically, with the former a character piece whose minimally sketched-out
    protagonist confesses, ""my native country is missing me."" Thanks to
    the included translations, the sadness and resignation of many of the other
    songs comes through loud and clear as well. 
    </p>
<p>
    Taha obviously feels close to the sentiments of such songs as the equally
    lost and hopeful ""Maydoum"", written by El Harrachi (whose Algerian
    anthem ""Ya Rayah"" led off the first <em>Diwan</em>). ""Only truth,
    but also faithfulness and purity, stand time,"" sings Taha, underscoring
    the implied mission of both <em>Diwan</em> discs. Taha's music, for all its
    radical twists and turns, is part of a long musical journey, and Taha, rather
    than hide or flee his heritage and whatever mislaid stigma comes attached to
    it, is compelled to make obvious and apparent the debt he owes the Rai and Chaâbi pioneers who came before him. Don't be surprised if, in 50 years, people
    start doing the same for Taha.

    Known equally for a staggering stage presence, his elegant tattoo art, and what he's spent so many years incanting, Daniel Higgs has produced brilliant, poetic rambles as the frontman/focalpoint of Baltimorean post-punk band Lungfish. A restless experimenter, Higgs has occasionally stepped outside the Lungfish framework: On <em>Ancestral Songs</em>, he labels himself ""Interdimensional Song-Seamstress"" and drops his most intriguing and powerful effort in years.</p><p>
    Building acoustic raga with guitar, voice, jaw harp, toy piano and banjo, Higgs conjures a vast nexus of hell, heaven, demons, angels, man, and all the overlaps in between. Imagine, if you can, the phrases and philosophies on the sides of Dr. Bronner's soap put to song by Roky Erickson and Henry Flynt.</p><p>
    Every bit a solo tent revival or one-on-one confession, the recording's spare, closed-in. The structure's reminiscent of David Thomas Broughton, but the ambience is less mournful, more celebratory. And, when he does get especially worked up, as in ""O Come And Walk Along (for S.)"", his chanted questionnaire (""Have you heard the lies about Christ?/ Have you heard the truth about Christ? It is a music evolving in time/ In the time of Christ, amen"") reinscribes his hardcore roots.</p><p>
    Tracks move through various phases (in both senses) of Indian drone and lapped lap steel. He stuffs the corners with a wonderful pallet-- electrocuted bells, flange tunneling, tonal strums, electric noise, a toy-box Hendrix squall, warped ringing. Now and again a guitar turns into a sitar. Each psalm offers echoes.</p><p>
    Opener ""Living in the Kingdom of Death"" introduces the central themes/doctrine: The human body is something we'll eventually throw off (""I love these living rags I wear"") and reality's a sort of ""kingdom of dreams"" where there's no clear-cut good or evil. For instance, the devil shows up in the ""true"" Christ and is also Christ's child bride. Sonically, the piece lays out a thread of tones that hums throughout the album. This has an obvious conceptual arc behind it-- the collection's title comes from this idea of inescapable connectivity: ""A mirror as broad as your life is long/ Your reflection, an echo of an ancient song."" That reflection and overlap occurs very much in the present: ""My beloved, the daughter of the sea and the air/ The reflective sea beneath the invisible air/ The conjunction of everything is everywhere.""</p><p>
    The chirpy field-recording ""Thy Chosen Bride"" is comparable, in parts, to Jewelled Antler or Will Oldham: Birds chirp and a banjo motors, and it lasts for more than 10 minutes. In its gentle duration, Higgs' playing is different than, say, Ben Chasny-- more traditional in some regards (hillbilly avant garde?), and he seems less interested in going places. Six-and-a-half minutes into ""Thy Chosen"", for instance, the music moves from finger picking to strums and singing. His voice channels Erickson (again): ""The root of time taps the corpse of space."" The birds hit various tones-- some are constant and some that seem to step forth and solo subtly in the background.
    </p>
<p>
    Albums that spend so much time on instrumental drone and ambient builds rarely nail the words like holy writ. Higgs could easily get consumed with one element-- he plays vast stretches of music as often as he sings-- but manages to wed the two threads. It's a fitting convergence considering his themes, and likewise, <em>Ancestral Songs</em>' shivers multiply after repeat listens-- each time he howls ""amen"" I want to get me to a church on time. But I guess part of Higgs' sermon is that you can never really be late.<br/>

I'm not talking about the way other music peaks, like a dance track where the beat kicks in and the crowd goes berzerk, or metal music that gets louder and louder until your skull caves, or gutbucket singers who can make your heart jump out of your chest. With art-rock, there's a lot of mumbo-jumbo and funny time signatures, and sometimes there's like 10 or 15 minutes of really boring shit (see: Yes, ""Awaken""). But when the ""good part"" hits? Holy shit-- the band crescendos and the singer, smooth as silk but loud as God, rams Buddha down the throat of a giant silver dragon. If I sound like I'm growing a mullet, I've done my job.</p><p>
    Deerhoof, an indie band who have released plenty of discombobulated pop and no wave albums, have lately turned toward accessible, foot-stomping rock. It worked on <em>The Runners Four</em>, but it works better and quicker on their new album, <em>Friend Opportunity</em>. We've been using the term ""inde prog"" mostly to describe bands that quick-cut between ideas and construct mini-suites out of mini-songs. But on this record Deerhoof take everything that clique of indie bands has worked toward-- add the suddenly popular twee vocals-- and ride it like an h-bomb.</p><p>
    If it weren't for Satomi Matsuzaki's little-girl voice, this music would be demagoguery: concussive beats, stabbing horn fills, pounding drums, a guitar chord that lands like a 10-ton weight on a 20-ton trampoline. I've never been more aware of the attack of an electric piano. And while a new love of knob-twiddling and loop-peddling brings more tonal colors, they're here for percussion, not atmosphere.
    </p><p>
    I didn't even want to make out all the words, in case I'd screw up the Obi Wan-spanks-Zelda Hero's Journey I had in my head in tracks one through nine. Snatches of story-like lyrics-- the stage-setting of ""The Perfect Me"", the flashes of conflict, warnings that ""It's a trap""-- imply a narrative arc, with a detour for a new character on ""Cast Off Crown"", drummer Greg Saunier's sole vocal performance and a mini-epic that crams introduction, exposition, and resolution into three minutes. 
    </p>
<p>
    The rest of the vocals are held down again by the high, heavily-accented singing of Matsuzaki. And the more song-like Deerhoof's music gets, the more obviously she becomes a barrier to new fans. The bleep-bloop speak-singing of ""Kidz are So Small"" seems to be the dealbreaker-- like you shouldn't take anything so sweet and cute seriously. (Listen to that gristly bleep in the background: that's a fucking droid, dude.) But wait 'til you hear the climactic ""Matchbook Seeks Maniac"": Jesus, Matsuzaki is the homecoming queen from Saturn, complete with silver glitter makeup and hip-side death ray. She rides the album's peak in the main chorus-- ""I would sell my soul to the devil/ If I could be the top of the world""-- and when she belts the title phrase? It makes me <em>quail</em>.

    Only thing is, after that 24-minute binge we get the 12-minute hangover of ""Look Away"". Like a rambling, shapeless homage to Yes' ""Sound Chaser"", it's listenable and it has a great instrumental traffic jam at the midpoint, but on this record it's just an appendix. All of a sudden the band is back to silences and blank stares, sustained tones and reverbed guitars. They're ""deconstructing pop,"" which means they're asking questions. But on <em>Friend Opportunity</em>, Deerhoof work best when they blast right to the answers.
