Having gone through a number of member and affiliate changes since UK producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8010-switch/"">Switch</a>—one half of the founding production team, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a>—jumped ship in 2011, their ever-evolving mission has been confusing, sloppy, and not entirely easy to nail down. Their debut album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13236-guns-dont-kill-people-lazers-do/""><i>Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do</i></a> was a singular artifact of Diplo's fascination with global dance music, for lack of a better catchall, for which he is often called out as an appropriator. Despite the fact that he and Switch worked on the album in Kingston and recruited dancehall bona fides for every track, from icons like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12970-vybz-kartel/"">Vybz Kartel</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5954-mr-vegas/"">Mr. Vegas</a> to up-and-comers like Brooklyn bashment luminary <a href=""http://www.mynameisrickyblaze.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Blaze</a>, it was still sticky with an undercurrent of tourism. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But with all of the pitfalls Major Lazer has faced since its inception—solo Diplo's hypeman Skerrit Bwoy's departure for religious pursuits; mismatched guests like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a>' Amber Coffman and Ezra Koenig of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a> for sophomore album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17627-major-lazer-free-the-universe/""><i>Free the Universe</i></a>—<i>Peace Is the Mission</i> finds the group finally emerging from their cocoon. What helped to pierce them out of a murky, genre-blurring funk, it turns out, was the confidence (and perhaps the notoriety and resources) to cash in and go full pop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even though Diplo already had work with major pop stars on his CV (namely, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>'s ""Pon De Floor""-sampling ""Run the World (Girls)"" and on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a>'s recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20293-rebel-heart/""><i>Rebel Heart</i></a>), it was Major Lazer's inclusion on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a>-curated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19909-various-artists-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-ost/"">soundtrack</a> for <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19909-various-artists-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-ost/""></a></i> that truly marked this sea change. Their contribution, ""All My Love"" featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31708-ariana-grande/"">Ariana Grande</a>, maintained their penchant for dancehall-inflected festival dubstep and worked in a winky interpolation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc7r_B0ZWDY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lollipop (Candyman)""</a> by Aqua (yes, the ""Barbie Girl"" group), all with a much slicker sheen. The song could have been just another paycheck, a chance to go for polish on a non-album project while staying esoteric with their own work, but lead single ""Lean On"", a collaboration with Danish upstart <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30799-m/"">MØ</a> and DJ Snake of ""Turn Down for What"" fame, indicated that they were sticking to this new refinement.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These tracks also illustrate what Major Lazer excel at: crafting intricate, innovative EDM for honey-voiced singers that pushes boundaries people like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22173-david-guetta/"">David Guetta</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5504-calvin-harris/"">Calvin Harris</a> seemingly refuse to touch. Album opener ""Be Together"" with Chicago sibling duo Wild Belle combines breathless yearning and skittering percussion in a way that sounds new, while the warbled soul of ""Powerful"", featuring vocals from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28682-ellie-goulding/"">Ellie Goulding</a> and reggae artist Tarrus Riley, swoons in a way we don't expect from the production trio. With his performance, stripped of patois and giving every Top 40 pretty boy a run for his money, Riley offers the album's best example of Major Lazer's ability to synthesize their influences. Where the previous two full-lengths tried to mesh opposing forces, here, they are finessed into no-nonsense stadium rattlers. Riley can master an EDM power-ballad, while the menace of a rapper like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"">Pusha T</a> meets its match with dancehall vet Mad Cobra on ""Night Riders"". Even a refreshed ""All My Love"" benefits from additional vocals from soca singer Machel Montano.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Lean On"" and ""Powerful"" will likely end up the big hits of <i>Peace</i>, but tracks like ""Too Original"" with Jovi Rockwell and Swedish singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30376-elliphant/"">Elliphant</a>, ""Light It Up"" featuring a guest appearance from R&amp;B-reggae duo Brick and Lace's Nyla, and Chronixx-featuring ""Blaze Up the Fire"" also show a group locating its footing. They accomplish the, well, <i>mission</i> the group has trained its sights on since its genesis—and it's because they've linked with artists who also deal in fusion. They're not forcing it. There is no doubt <i>Peace Is the Mission</i> will suffer some criticism from dancehall purists, those exhausted by EDM and people who hate Diplo (a hate that he has certainly <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/arular-10-years-later-m-i-a-reflects-on-globe-shaking-debut-20150320"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">worked overtime to earn</a>), but their maturation is palpable across the album's nine tracks. In the process, they've made a great pop record through uniting some of the globe's most exciting and celebrated pop artists.</p></div>"|20519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20519-peace-is-the-mission/|7.4|Claire Lobenfeld

The focal point in the IG clips is Gates’ oversized personality, up close and personal (these videos are usually 90% his face in closeup) but somehow inscrutable: You never really see exactly where he is, or what he’s doing, or fully understand the things he’s getting worked up about. In Gates’ rapping, there is the same strange dichotomy of intimacy and mysteriousness: Often, we get a window into an extremely specific and personal story without seeing its full arc. Gates refuses to hold our hand as he zigzags between talking points and styles, which is why we hang on his every word and gesture—we search for context, closure, and understanding, but it's constantly withheld. The video monologues begin and end mid-thought, suggesting a faucet being turned on and off, and his flow, too, is like a source that just has to be been tapped into, rather than started up and wound down.</p>
<p>Increasingly, these days, Gates’ music sounds like an unfiltered representation of his id. It’s less carefully fashioned than on his unerringly catchy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17808-kevin-gates-the-luca-brasi-story/""><i>Luca Brasi Story</i></a> or the street-rap style primer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19109-kevin-gates-by-any-means/""><i>By Any Means</i></a>. On his latest, mini-mixtape <i>Murder for Hire</i>, especially, his emotions and points of inspiration seem to rush in at once, like potential energy suddenly unleashed. Musically and structurally, there are easy comparisons to be made between this release and Atlanta rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>’s darkly comic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20424-56-nights/""><i>56 Nights</i></a>: the scorched-earth, stream-of-consciousness flows, the paranoid atmosphere, the less immediate hooks. The street-rap-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>-like overtones which surprised on Gates’ 2013 work are barely there; the hooks are chant-based, sometimes pallid rather than craggily soulful.</p>
<p>But unlike Future’s album, there is the lingering impression of <i>Murder for Hire</i> being a follow-up EP of outtakes rather than a carefully streamlined statement (notably, ""Rican Johnny"" shares its primary melody with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20059-luca-brasi-2/""><i>Luca Brasi 2</i></a>’s leadoff banger ""John Gotti"", and comes across like another draft of the same song). As on <i>Brasi 2</i> (released in December), there are some career highs on <i>Murder for Hire</i>, but it is dramatically less consistent than his previous 2013-14 work. Unlike <i>Brasi 2</i>, however, the lows here are more nondescript than far-flung and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ndTM67m3HE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">strange</a>. This is a rarity for Gates, since one of his strengths has always been transforming near-stock beats and relatively unassuming trap hooks into colossal, immutable rap songs. Still, on forgettable tracks like ""Thuggin Hard in the Trap House"" and ""Her"", the lack of melody and a lynchpin of a primary line undoes him.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, however, he’s busy doing the exact opposite—eerie Autotune d-boy anthem ""Chico"" hinges on the drawn-out cry of ""My Jamaican bring the reefer iiiiinn,"" a small gesture which elevates a potentially forgettable post-Luger anthem into a standout. The two most impressive tracks on the tape, though, are ""Khaza"" and ""Mexico"", two newfangled trap records on which nothing seems to stay consistent except for that dry, wood-shaving of a snare on beats two and four. ""Mexico"" is restrained, driven by some synth take on an eerie Celtic harp, and features Gates’ sharpest lyrics on the album (""So-and-So broke my jaw with the flash light/ All because I wouldn’t make my pockets look like bunny ears/ Killed a nigga, broke and ran, piss running down my leg/ Went and hid the gun behind the counting house""). ""Khaza"", on the other hand, is one of Gates’ fiercest songs to date, a great hookless wonder full of free-association both hilarious and frightening. A sneering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"">Gucci Mane</a>-like emphasis is built appealingly into his flow throughout (""Free the ‘wop, that’s Gucci, nigga,"" he cries at the end of the song) and his rapping feels more measured and expressive than anywhere else on the tape. </p>
<p>This is by no means an essential Gates release, but still serves as an interesting document of where he is artistically. Whether future releases will move further away from the warm and inviting hooks of his earlier records (those which helped him, initially, set up a major-label partnership and become a nationally vital act) toward more freeform structure and experimentation remains to be seen. However, <i>Murder for Hire</i> demonstrates that the results will doubtless be unpredictable, full of flights of inspiration and, unfortunately, some moments when Gates seems to be not all there.</p></div>"|20659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20659-murder-for-hire-ep/|7.1|Winston Cook-Wilson

Like a few zillion other bands, they formed in the summer of 1978, just as punk rock was turning into post-punk. By the time they recorded their first single, 1980's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT_NFMWceNs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Die Laughing""</a>, they'd clearly had their minds blown by a couple of their contemporaries—especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/307-bauhaus/"">Bauhaus</a> (for whom they were opening when <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a>'s Ivo Watts-Russell first heard them), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd/"">Public Image Ltd</a>. They immediately mastered the tone of that moment's music: echoing minor-key drones, a wailing singer with an unpretty voice, rhythms modified from disco to evoke faltering inhuman mechanisms rather than motion and delight, words that suggested imminent disaster.</p>
<p>But they weren't <i>quite</i> there. Singer/keyboardist David Steiner didn't have the vocal charisma of a John Lydon or Ian Curtis; their songs announced their intent right up front, and then didn't offer any surprises. Listen to In Camera's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b5N75G0FNM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fragments of Fear""</a> on its own, and it sounds like a fine example of its time and genre, with guitarist Andrew Gray's dissonant, trebly riff settling over the recording like a clammy fog. Compare it to, say, Bauhaus's superficially similar <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sCTxS_B6h4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Terror Couple Kill Colonel""</a>, released on the same label a few months earlier, and you hear what's missing. Bauhaus's song offers the dry wit of its tabloid-headline title, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2868-peter-murphy/"">Peter Murphy</a>'s out-of-nowhere grunting and panting, and details of intonation that refine its repetitions into hooks. In Camera's song just kind of sounds eerie for four-and-a-half minutes.</p>
<p>""Fragments of Fear"" appeared on In Camera's accurately titled <i>IV Songs</i> EP in late 1980. Around the same time, they recorded three new songs for John Peel's radio show (subsequently released as another EP, <i>Fin</i>), then broke up before they ever made an album. Guitarist Andrew Gray joined their 4AD labelmates the Wolfgang Press; the whole band reconvened briefly in 1991 to finish off four incomplete songs for a retrospective, <i>13 (Lucky for Some)</i>.</p>
<p><i>Era</i>, true to <i>its </i>title, doesn't include those four tracks. Instead, it augments the nine songs of In Camera's original discography with a couple of demos, some indistinct live recordings, and a five-song rehearsal tape. For enthusiasts of the goth/post-punk nexus, it absolutely has its moments: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqjx4gAuEtQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Attic""</a> is carried by sour, hammering chords from Pete Moore's bass guitar, and ""The Fatal Day""<span>—</span>an 11-minute-plus doom-disco jam from their Peel session<span>—</span>hints at the expanses they might have explored if they stuck around a while. It also has some unintentionally funny flashes of insight into the band: the parts of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgCgO_BHFho"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Legion""</a> that aren't a slower knockoff of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akz2efTdJ-E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Anthrax""</a> mostly seem to be derived from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRJfIPiJGY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bela Lugosi's Dead"".</a> </p>
<p>But that's fine. Every scene has its geniuses and its hangers-on; pioneers need somebody to follow them. For every band that creates something magnificent and enduring, there are five more who catch on early to their innovations, maybe come up with a couple of good songs, and end up really only being of interest to listeners who are very curious about their great contemporaries' historical context. In Camera were one of those, and there's no shame in that, either.</p></div>"|20407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20407-era/|5.9|Douglas Wolk

But he also distinguishes himself with a sound you might peg as Teutonic before Scandinavian. While the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"">Prins Thomas</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5718-diskjokke/"">diskJokke</a> range over earth and space, none cover precisely the furrowed, cratered landscape Bratten claims. Featuring dark hues and rough crags, it inspires visions of low, ore-spined mountains. In an Oslo-producer family portrait, you'd imagine Bratten as the lurking one, in the black ribbed turtleneck, looking on severely as porn-mustached <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19148-todd-terje-its-album-time/"">Todd Terje</a> makes bunny ears behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"">Lindstrøm</a>'s bucket cap. </p>
<p>At six tracks, <i>Math Ilium Ion</i> looks like an EP, but its half-hour length and lack of filler makes it feel like an LP. Bratten consistently cultivates ominous tension, even as he instills a certain measure of stubborn optimism, pressing corroded frequenices into diamond-hard melodies. He avoids clear-cut builds and releases, laying parts with their own internal tension in rows and letting their ripple mete out catharsis. This is especially clear on ""Trommer &amp; Bass"", where heavy basses and scissoring percussion seem to strike at a stationary target, with relentless assassin-like accuracy, for almost five minutes, until the hammering finally drops and glides. </p>
<p>Bratten's music has a monstrous mechanical movement, but his tuned toms and chattering patterns are offset with live-feeling accents that rattle in the grid, giving the sense of someone striking a head in real space. The music feels wonderfully self-generative, as if willing itself into being. With its controlled speaker fry and choked-out melody, album highlight ""Yours Sincerely, Andre Bratten"" ingeniously un-crumbles together. Bratten's sounds don't just lurch in; they take shape before our ears. You can picture him slowly turning knobs to tame each wild tone into the groove, which is never far away, even when it decays into textured abstractions that keep alertly pushing it forward.</p>
<p>Though many passages of <i>Math Ilium Ion </i>are highly kinetic, only ""Trommer &amp; Bass"" is ready for the floor. The record's games with time are clearly built with the listener in mind. ""The Little Things, Fools and Kings"" opens with a terrific little near-catastrophe. Many tiny elements seem to accelerate in at different rates but arrive simultaneously at the same place, to be promptly drawn taut with one oozing lump of saw waves. By the time we get to the two ""Misconception"" tracks, mutated rave overtones have subsided into something more like ambient house, deep and broad and full of subtle activity. Since we are fully immersed, it's welcome.</p>
<p>The only thing even slightly bothersome about Bratten is that sometimes he doesn’t quite nail the landings, which is strange since he takes so much care until then. The abrupt endings of several tracks are startling after all the subtle permutation we've been through, and a little unsatisfying. But that minor complaint really means that, when so much similar music is available, it's easy to stay invested in these long tracks all the way to the end. When the next groove is always one antsy keystroke away, that's saying something for Bratten.</p></div>"|20634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20634-math-ilium-ion-ep/|7.7|Brian Howe

Backed by the requisite jumping cheerleaders and bored-looking spectators in a set of makeshift bleachers, Rifat's set choice was unusual—nothing on her self-titled debut, a frenetic, strobe-lit dance record from start to finish, seems influenced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> whatsoever, ""Prophet"" least of all. But with her label boss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"">Robyn</a> beside her, the two of them leaping into a choreographed, athletic dance routine with the cheerleaders and onlookers joining in, the re-enactment seemed to make some more sense. Rifat, like her fembot mentor and Nirvana before her, finds rapture in agitating the boring status quo through music, whether by inserting a chaotic, grunge-inspired dance performance into Sweden's answer to the Grammys or go-go dancing until dawn at her former <a href=""http://gaylesbian.visitstockholm.com/2013/03/29/donna-scam/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stockholm ""gayhappening"" club Donna Scam</a>. If Zhala is Sweden's next big pop export, she's surely one of the most idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>That being said, it comes as something of a surprise that Rifat, as the only act signed to <a href=""http://koniciwarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Konichiwa Records</a> apart from Robyn herself, doesn't seem compelled to distance herself from the pop savant's shadow. Instead, on <i>Zhala</i>, Rifat pulls generously from her Scandinavian pop and electronic forebears, most distinctly in the mechanical <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">Knife</a>-like drum patterns, aerobic Robyn-esque melodies, and jagged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp/"">Röyksopp</a> synths that make up the building blocks for her kitchen-sink vision. Electro workouts like ""Aerobic Lambada"" and ""Lunch"" sound like deep cuts from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14917-body-talk/""><i>Body Talk</i></a> filtered through the howling, experimental wheelhouse of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"">Gang Gang Dance</a>, while latest single ""Holy Bubbles"", with its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6-abba/"">ABBA</a>-sized synths and strangely exultant, chanted outro (""I'll be kind/ Don't be too kind""), stretches her sound into teeming disco territory. Elsewhere, the pristine ""Prince in the Jungle"" and ballad ""Right Way's Wrong"" benefit from slower, more languid tempos, offering welcome smoke breaks from the club-ready clamor. ""Prophet"", which reappears here alongside two other tracks from a previous EP, is still Rifat's best, a tense, formidable techno freak-out that seems designed for some kind of decadent/disturbing acid trip with comedowns built into it for good measure.</p>
<p>Speaking at Robyn's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/746-what-happens-when-there-are-no-boys-in-the-room-a-report-from-robyns-tekla-conference/"">Tekla conference</a> this past April, Rifat said she taught herself Ableton through YouTube tutorials to better sustain the singular vision she had for her music. Here, assisted by lone co-producer Mathias Oldén, it's a trait that reveals itself in the more unconventional production flourishes—guitar peals that skid in and drift off like a passing motorcycle, Spaghetti Western whistles that melt into a warped acid track, roaring voices that bend and circle over pneumatic drum machines. Some lyrics, too, describe an unexpected, poignant gloominess to the high-energy club life Rifat devotes herself to (""Intuition say no more, nobody knows my sadness,"" she sings on ""Aerobic Lambada"", ""nobody but God, but I don't know him that well""). But in the scramble to unify a host of influences, sounds, and ideas, some songs inevitably start to blend together, burying Rifat's vocals in the mix. It's unfortunate, since her voice, which bounds between chanting, singing, and banshee calls, is a triumphant and emphatic instrument when not trampled under bright swathes of synths, squawking bird calls, or pummeling beats.</p>
<p><i>Zhala</i>, according to Rifat, is a conceptual, ""cosmic pop"" journey of self-discovery. Live, she often performs in front of Kurdish or Swedish flags in a purposeful attempt to blur her identity, which, being born in Stockholm to Kurdish parents, she says she was perpetually forced to negotiate as a neither blonde-haired nor blue-eyed child in mid-'90s Sweden. Her heritage comes through on songs like ""Prophet"" and opener ""I'm in Love"", which at their peaks conjure <i>Halparke</i>, a type of Kurdish dance that's typically set to percussive, techno-paced Middle Eastern music. The reference is <i>Zhala</i>'s strongest, pushing the album's central dance and electronic motifs into a wider realm that sets the work apart from Robyn or any other Swedish mainstay in recent years. <i>Zhala</i> can be a crowded voyage, but it's Rifat's polychromed, referential creativity that still makes it one worth taking.</p></div>"|20656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20656-zhala/|7.1|Eric Torres

Accordingly, her band's third studio album <i>How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful</i> is one long Ophelia mad scene, a breakup record from the point of view of someone who is absolutely convinced that her breakup is the most devastating thing that has ever happened to anyone.</p>
<p>She makes a pretty good case for that, to be fair. ""What was it that I said?/ I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed,"" she cries in ""Ship to Wreck"", which goes from sleeping pills to great white sharks in its first two lines. Welch has <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/florence-and-the-machine/82946"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quoted</a> producer Markus Dravs as telling her that she's ""not allowed to write any more songs about water,"" although she appears to have dodged that dictum at every opportunity.</p>
<p>These aren't just songs about heartbreak; they're songs about total and utter eclipses of the heart. ""Delilah"", for instance, concerns the epic psychic carnage involved in waiting for a phone call from a boyfriend, and yes, that's Delilah as in Samson. (Several songs later, she's ""thrashing on the line,"" this time as a fish.) Over the course of the album, she also invokes (or casts herself as) Persephone, Lot's wife, the Virgin Mary, Daphne, Jonah, and St. Jude<span>—</span>both the saint and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_storm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">European storm</a>, alluded to in both senses in two different songs. Over ""Queen of Peace""'s stomps and choir and horns, she imagines herself ""dissolving like the setting sun/ Like a boat into oblivion/<i>' CAUSE YOU'RE DRIVING ME AWAAAAAAY!</i>"" (See? Aquatic lyrics again.)</p>
<p>It takes an alarming seriousness of purpose to pull this stuff off—the campy playfulness of Florence and the Machine's 2009 debut single ""Kiss With a Fist"" wouldn't do. The obvious presence lurking near Welch's current songwriting is Adele, whose ""Rolling in the Deep"" she has to wish she'd thought of first, but the other source of inspiration floating nearby is PJ Harvey, specifically the PJ Harvey of <i>To Bring You My Love</i>. (As with Harvey, there's a lot of gender-flipping in Welch's lyrics: ""Mother"" would be very obviously a gospel song if it were called ""Father"".) Welch's voice trembles and groans until she hauls herself up to the parts of her songs that she can belt out with desperate, bleating vibrato. And the arrangements on <i>How Big</i> are <i>this</i> big: lush and ornate, tinkering with their details every few seconds, cresting and crashing and cresting and cresting some more. The title track's orchestral coda is worthy of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGOaPSvQlrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trevor Horn's wildest fantasies</a>.</p>
<p>What really binds <i>How Big</i> together, though, is Welch's exceptional sense for melody. No matter how tormented these songs get, they let her show off with grand, arching vocal lines, leaping deftly across her registers. (There are going to be a lot of disappointed karaoke singers signing up for ""What Kind of Man"" or ""Delilah"", then discovering that their range is nowhere near Welch's.) This is a huge, sturdy record, built for arenas<span>—</span>the band is among the headliners at this year's Bonnaroo, Roskilde, Lollapalooza and Governors Ball<span>—</span>and it's richly and carefully enough constructed to endure the extensive exposure Welch's heartache is going to get over the course of this summer.</p></div>"|20605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20605-how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful/|7.6|Douglas Wolk

In 2012, Martin—the former drummer of a knotty blues-metal band and a big-rig driver to boot—released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16466-daughn-gibson-all-hell/""><i>All Hell</i></a>, his debut LP under a name just one fancy vowel sound removed from revered country crooner Don Gibson. <i>All Hell </i>arrived as an uncanny wonder, with Martin’s gorgeous and mysterious baritone presiding over an ad hoc band built of soul, country, and soundtrack samples he’d snipped from thrift-store finds. Martin bellowed elliptical tales where lovers discovered the worst in one another, smooth talkers seduced damsels, and daddies cursed the kids that fate had delivered.</p>
<p>A daring juxtaposition of disparate forms, it was issued in <a href=""http://www.whitedenim.com/wd19.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a tiny domestic edition of only 400 copies</a>, marking it a curio meant for the few weirdos who might catch on. But a lot of people actually caught on—the press, a booking agent, slowly growing audiences, and the label <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a>, which signed Daughn Gibson just as <i>All Hell</i>’s dark gospel began to spread. Martin found himself fronting a band expected to tour and record. On 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18248-daughn-gibson-me-moan/""><i>Me Moan</i></a> and the uneasy new <i>Carnation</i>, he’s still trying to negotiate the sound of that unexpected future.</p>
<p>Like <i>Me Moan</i>, <i>Carnation</i> finds Martin stepping out of isolation and away from batches of samples to write and record with other musicians in real time. In 2013, <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/me-moan-mw0002545241/credits"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the cast</a> included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"">Baroness</a>’ John Baizley, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/474-brokeback/"">Brokeback</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1324-eleventh-dream-day/"">Eleventh Dream Day</a> guitarist Jim Elkington, and a small clutch of horn-and-string players. Here, he skips to a different scene, working with versatile Seattle producer Randall Dunn (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/236-akronfamily/"">Akron/Family</a>) and a cast of Dunn standbys, including string arranger Eyvind Kang and former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a> multi-instrumentalist Steve Moore. Only Elkington returns. The performances and the production at large are impeccable. The band is as assured with the slinking poses of ""It Wants Everything"" as they are the sashaying cool of ""For Every Bite"" or the string-backed slowness of ""Runaway and the Pyro"".</p>
<p>But that variety—or, less generously, Martin’s halting stylistic indecision—plagues <i>Carnation</i>. For 38 minutes, he seems like an accidental bandleader who has no idea where he’s leading his band, let alone how to get them there. The rudiments of <i>All Hell</i>, from the country touches to the sampler obsession,<i> </i>survive only in the crevices—the baritone guitar echoing around the light new wave pulse of ""Shatter You Through"", the vocal loops bouncing beneath and around it. Martin loosens his grip on that once-dominant baritone, too, sometimes affecting a foppish British accent and occasionally slipping into lounge-singer softness. The indecision starts in the center and spreads, as Martin and crew work through homages to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8280-soft-machine/"">Soft Machine</a> and depressive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a>, coruscated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> and languid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>. During ""I Let Him Deal"", he launches into a chorus that could be cut straight from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>’s catalog; for its chaser, ""Shine of the Night"", he nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a> and indulges a saxophone solo, even as he sings about staying alive on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_of_Death"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iraq’s infamous Highway of Death</a>. The first half of closer ""Back with the Family"" sounds like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a> fantasy, the second like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a>nightmare. There are some bright spots here, especially in the grand attempts at pop, but Martin’s presiding confusion mitigates their album-length impact.</p>
<p>Worst of all, though, is the way these shifts hamper his songwriting. <i>All Hell</i> built big, poignant scenes out of tiny, perfect details. And for all its transitional woes, <i>Me Moan</i> showed Martin to be a vivid, sharp storyteller in the making. He loaded his lyrics with references and sly turns of phrase—the romantic at ""the corner lobo solo … dreamin’ with the TV lit"" or the widower trying to find nostalgic comfort in surrounding sounds and sights. But these lyrics are thin, limpid, and loose. The writing gathers a smattering of soft-focus snapshots, twisted aphorisms, and dimensionless characters. Martin gives us the teenager who’d rather hang himself than turn into a hideous man during ""A Rope Ain’t Enough"" and a young patient who's left a mental hospital during ""Daddy I Cut My Hair"". But we learn so little about each of them, their circumstances or their motives. They seem like mere verbal stand-ins for jams by the Daughn Gibson Big Band. If every Daughn Gibson song used to prompt a mental short film, <i>Carnation </i>is a collage of bad watercolors and corrupted Polaroids.</p>
<p>Gibson’s voice has always echoed another era, but his approach has seemed deliberately contemporary, too, eager to step over stylistic borders and bend the past against the present. Beyond his baritone or assorted honky-tonk accents, that quality is the essential link from <i>All Hell </i>to <i>Me Moan </i>to <i>Carnation</i>. But I like to imagine Daughn Gibson’s trajectory had <i>All Hell </i>been recorded and released in another epoch of the music industry, one where so many strange and stunning private-press records <a href=""http://www.furious.com/perfect/garyhiggins.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">languished in obscurity</a> until being rediscovered decades later. <i>All Hell </i>collected but 10 short songs, some of which seemed like sketches of a nebulous idea, with space for elaboration and edges for refinement. Without the need to meet public expectation or record label demands, what might that aesthetic have become in seclusion?</p>
<p>Perhaps he would have enriched the language and stretched the sounds, as he did on <i>Me Moan</i>. But it seems unlikely that being cloistered would have yielded a record like <i>Carnation</i>, a set of songs that discard almost all sense of Martin’s singularity in favor of a search for anything new that <i>might</i> work. Martin’s uniqueness was the very element that turned him from a tall dude with a deep voice making odd records on a tiny imprint to a troubadour enlisted in an indie empire. But some slight attention has spoiled his significant idiosyncrasy. On <i>Carnation</i>, he tries and fails to be something other than himself.</p></div>"|20597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20597-carnation/|4.3|Grayson Haver Currin

You can attribute its singular nature to the fact it’s, in large part, the creation of one man—Richard Mthethwa, aka Nozinja. A large, avuncular businessman who formerly ran a successful mobile phone repair store in South Africa’s poor, rural Limpopo province, as the story goes, Nozinja heard the music being made by his peers and spied an opportunity.</p>
<p>An electronic, MIDI-powered take on local Shangaan folk traditions, kwaito, and South African house, Nozinja’s productions—which have been the engine of a number of artists and groups, including <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXEZeVgmCg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tshetsha Boys</a>, <a href=""https://hardwax.com/63598/bbc/nwagezani/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">B.B.C.</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29237-zinja-hlungwani/"">Zinja Hlungwani</a>—sit somewhere between the naïve and the visionary: catchy constructions of synthesized flute and marimba, dotty drum machine, and soulful romantic entreaties dialed up to the speed of an agitated hummingbird. Even in South Africa, Shangaan Electro appears to have been relatively obscure, a localized sound made for communities, not clubs. But thanks to the support of the Brooklyn documentarian Wills Glasspiegel, Shangaan Electro found its way out of South Africa in 2010, with releases on the London-based <a href=""http://honestjons.com/shop/latest_100_arrivals"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Honest Jon's</a> label, remixes from respected producers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>, and Nozinja helming a travelling Shangaan Electro roadshow, performing with Shangaan dancers: men in clown masks and bright orange jumpsuits, women shaking their rumps in big floaty dresses.</p>
<p>Nozinja’s leap to a label such as <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp Records</a> feels significant, to see how <i>Nozinja Lodge</i> might advance its maker’s vision. The sound is slightly more polished—although that might largely be the consequence of a good mastering job—while keyboards add a bit of body, lending a reggae skank to ""Baby Do U Feel Me"", and lacing plaintive descending melodies amongst the freeform snare eruptions of ""Xihukwani"".</p>
<p>If <i>Nozinja Lodge</i> proves anything, it’s that Shangaan Electro’s sense of twitchy acceleration remains fundamental. Playing live, Nozinja gradually tweaks his music faster and faster, introducing each lift in tempo with the booming gusto of a carnival master. Much like footwork, you get the impression his music evolved to cater to the demands of athletic dancing bodies. Consequently, it makes a certain sense that attempts here to temper Shangaan Electro’s frenetic pace don’t always come off. ""Mitshetsho We Zindaba"", a 120BPM bounce, holds its own thanks to a bright palette of bendy keyboards and the hearty call-and-response of a female Shangaan choir. By contrast, album closer ""Wo Va Jaha"", plodding along at ballad tempo, feels somewhat ordinary by comparison. Broadly, <i>Nozinja Lodge</i>’s finest moments—the spry, insistent ""Tsekeleke"", the frenetic pointillism of ""N'wanga I Jesu""—adhere pretty closely to their maker’s celebrated original 180BPM template.</p>
<p>That Shangaan Electro has made waves outside of South Africa feels to be a lot to do with its weird collision of signifiers: lo-fi electronic sounds that Western listeners might consider tacky or tinpot, fused to an African singing style that speaks of love, yearning, and other matters of the heart with earnest sincerity. Post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a>, the modern DJ set can feel like a finger smeared across borders, cultural forms dissolved into beige global mulch. But unlike, say, footwork, Nozinja’s music defies such easy assimilation. Almost devoid of low-end, and presented with a sunny spirit generally incompatible with gangsta posturing, it’s a sound that—in unremixed form, at least—amiably refuses to be absorbed. </p>
<p>Consequently, it remains hard to determine Shangaan Electro’s significance to dance music at large. Who could copy it, without sounding absurd? Of course, in the context of <i>Nozinja Lodge</i> as a self-contained ""artist"" album, all that hardly matters. Instead, it serves as a reminder we should treasure these rare outliers wherever we find them.</p></div>"|20538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20538-nozinja-lodge/|6.9|Louis Pattison

<p>These are a few of the 150-plus people killed by gun violence in Chicago so far in 2015. All of these names (and the ones I don’t have the space to list) are important, but for 22-year-old Durk ""Lil Durk"" Banks the last name hits incredibly close to home. Agina (better known as OTF Chino) was Durk’s manager, a confidante who was, in a cruel sense of irony, murdered after meeting with Bulls player Joakim Noah in an attempt to partner Durk with the latter’s anti-violence organization. It’s doubly frustrating given Durk’s affiliation with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"">French Montana</a>’s Coke Boys imprint, which recently suffered the loss of rising member Chinx Drugz. Durk’s first studio album (he’s released 5 mixtapes overall) since signing to <a href=""http://www.defjam.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Def Jam</a> back during the Great Chicago Rap Gold Rush a few years back, <i>Remember My Name,</i> is a project that has the spectre of death looming over it at all times.</p>
<p>A common criticism of Durk’s music revolves around his near-total dependency on Auto-Tune. He’s aware of the charge, addressing it on ""What Your Life Like"". The software is Durk’s friend when he adopts a singing delivery, like on single ""Like Me"". The tune showcases Durk (and featured crooner/fellow Chicagoan <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a>) in his lane fully, producing a smooth entry into the pantheon of Sensitive Thug jams. Other times, like on the absolutely grating ""Tryna' Tryna'"" or when he tries to feebly hit high notes during the chorus on, uh, ""Higher"" it can be his worst enemy. Luckily, the highs outweigh the lows. It’s apparent after a few listens that Durk is only getting better, from both a rapping and writing perspective. He’s definitely grown from his earlier mixtapes (he sounds like a different person entirely than the one who once rapped <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MntLMkF1z2c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Yo' bitch know she doin' dick, we call that ho double D.""</a> Growth! Progression! Artist Development!).</p>
<p>It’s apparent that Durk has a solid ear for production and a nascent ability to craft songs that get caught in your ear. The C-Sick-produced opener ""500 Homicides"" is a thunderous intro that finds Durk viciously addressing enemies, shouting out his affiliates and reminding folks that there are repercussions of your online actions. ""What’s up with this Twitter beef?/ Thought we was keeping in the streets?.../ Hell yeah, you can die over a retweet!""</p>
<p><i>Remember My Name</i> as an album isn’t going to change lives. It is, however, a view into the psyche of those who reframe the concept of death as a way of life, a cost of doing business, or even a source of motivation to create a better life for yourself and those you care about. On the album standout ""What Your Life Like"", Durk laments, ""They say the murder started after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MntLMkF1z2c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L’s</a>/ Now my phone got shit to tell... /Got that call, they cancelled 20 shows/ That's money down the drain/ I got kids, don't take it wrong.""</p>
<p>The moment underlines a curious tension for Durk and the other artists in his orbit. The culture of the neighborhoods that produced Durk, his OTF (Only The Family) affiliates and the rest of the various artists who find their sounds lazily lumped together under the name ""drill music"" find themselves in a weird catch-22. You rap about the stuff you’re seeing (and participating in, for some) and you’re rewarded with money, fame and the opportunity to make your life better. At the same time, you’re branded as ""trouble"" by promoters, your profile is raised among the police and old enemies, and you’re forced to go on the defensive. The thing that might make your life better might be the same thing that ends up killing you. What in the hell are you supposed to do? On <i>Remember My Name</i>, Durk chooses to keep on keepin’ on.</p></div>"|20564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20564-remember-my-name/|5.6|Ernest Wilkins

A former Army brat who eventually settled in Chicago, Alexander has been DJing since 1993 and making music for nearly as long, but he only began releasing records around 2008. In that light, the cover image of a mountain climber scaling a snowy peak at a 45-degree angle has a slight autobiographical tinge: In electronic music, full-lengths always tend to constitute milestones, but for an artist like Alexander, who has made his name later than many, there's a palpable sense of raised stakes.</p>
<p>Appropriate for someone with such a deep and abiding investment in a scene, Alexander uses <i>Love &amp; Fear</i> to contend with the legacy of American techno. Any attempt to extend that legacy raises questions: How do you evoke a classic sound when innovation was central to that tradition? Can you pay tribute to your roots without the music withering on the vine? Making do with the same sorts of synthesizers and drum machines that have dominated dance music for the past quarter-century, his response is to worry less about novel sound design and focus on his machines'—and his own—expressive capabilities.</p>
<p>One way he does that is to explore a far wider range of tempos than most. ""A Virtuous Woman!"" treads a strange, slow-motion path, stepping and strutting, as a scaly bassline ties itself up in writhing knots, and atonal bleeps suggest the ghost of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YPiCeLwh5o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Numbers""</a>. The title track is even slower, with a stately synthesizer melody that braids itself around snapping, deliberate hi-hats and rimshots. Even sitting in your chair, you can tell that it's a track made for dancers, an invitation to move the body in different ways. ""The Blues (Never Had)"", even slower, offers the opportunity to get horizontal: smeared in jazzy chords, pitch-bent keyboard solos, and meandering vocals, it's a narcotic funk number, while ""Tranquility Base!"" dials up the tempo to footwork's high-flying range. It's woozier than most footwork, though, with tightly syncopated rimshots banging like a screen door in a storm, and hi-hats spinning like a wheel that can't get traction. ""That's how I feel inside,"" sings a doleful voice, as chilly Juno pads voice even chillier chords, buzzing and bracing as an ice-cream headache. The only tranquility here is an overarching sense of numbness.</p>
<p>He also experiments with instrumentation—""A Child Is Born"" pairs the chimes of '90s electronica with the fat, rich tones of a church organ—and with themes not often represented in techno. In ""Nordisk Saga!"", he looks north for inspiration and overlays his moody synths and sparse drums with a dramatic reading of a Nordic saga written by Cecilia Bruun Hansen, all crisp consonants and alien-sounding vowels and rolled ""R""s, and references to Freyja and Ragnarok. He presumably got the idea from his time in Malmö, where he lives for part of the year. But given how often white European producers have appropriated African-Americans' voices—all those tracks made with Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, for instance—Alexander's Scandinavian gambit also amounts to a clever turning of the tables.</p>
<p>But at the root of Alexander's music is a simple knack for what makes sounds come alive, both on the dance floor and off. The three relatively straight-down-the-middle techno/house cuts here are among the most immediate, attention-grabbing work he's produced yet, although none of them quite nail the spooky transcendence of 2013's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEBBj9PeMw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Go""</a>. In ""Tight Situations"", carefully deployed dissonance sends chills down the spine, and he shows off his arranger's chops with counterpoints that sneakily keep evolving. ""Moist Flesh!"" is a warm bath of swelling pads and playful plucked leads. And the crowning glory of it all is ""Komm, süßer Tod, komm selge Ruh!"", which takes its title from one of Bach's <i>69 Sacred Songs and Arias</i>. The bassline takes the form of a gnarled, shape-shifting throb; the background swirls with metallic chirps; and as the track patiently unfolds, it gives way to a wild, psychedelic cadenza reminiscent of one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>'s guitar solos. ""Come sweet death, come blessed rest,"" is the translation of the title, and the song's graceful chord changes echo the sentiment, faintly.

This is true in both the literal sense—memory is one of the device’s key specs, measuring how much sonic information it can hold in its ""mind"" at once—but also as a metaphor. When you capture and play back a sound, transposing it to a new context, you are ""playing"" the memories that have attached themselves to the original piece of music as much as you are playing a particular piece of sound. The producer Jamie Smith, better known to the world as Jamie xx, is a sampling artist and a memory artist. He does things with the music he's absorbed and with the associations that are embedded within it. So when we listen to his music, we aren’t just listening to music played by people in a room. We’re listening to his listening and hearing his hearing; he senses memories in certain sounds—some of which he was there to experience the first time, some of which have been handed down to him—and transforms them into something new and personal.</p>
<p><i>In Colour</i>, Jamie xx’s full-length solo debut, has been a rumor for a few years now. In 2011, he followed his remix collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28552-gil-scott-heron/"">Gil Scott-Heron</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15140-were-new-here/""><i>We’re New Here</i></a>, with his debut single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12215-far-nearer/"">""Far Nearer""</a>. It was strikingly different from his work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">the xx</a> and hearing it, it was possible to triangulate and imagine the broader and more varied sensibility that served as an umbrella over both. The emergence of Jamie xx as a producer’s voice is part of what made the xx’s follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17022-coexist/""><i>Coexist</i></a>, disappointing. It’s a decent record, but once we had a better sense of Jamie xx’s range, it was hard to square that knowledge with the narrow aesthetic parameters of his main band, lovely as their music could be. All along, this one was coming together. One of the great things about him is he works slow and gets everything just so, treating each project as the one chance to get it right. <i>In Colour</i> gets there: it’s the dazzling culmination of Jamie xx’s last six years of work, gathering up elements of everything he’s done—moody ballads, floor-filling bangers, expansive and off-kilter collaborations with vocalists—and packing them tightly into a glittering ball that reflects spinning fragments of feeling back at us.</p>
<p>A key idea embedded in the notion of rave is it had something for everyone. Though rave was at one point very fashionable, it was also, early on and at its best, egalitarian. The platonic ideal of the dancefloor, which is obviously never quite fulfilled, is that the dancers meet as equals. Everyone is on their own journey and there is no judgement, and the right drugs at the right time have helped to bring this starry-eyed vision to life. Jamie xx’s music captures some of this spirit by being terribly hip and of-the-moment but also deeply emotional. It’s ""cool"" music designed to make you feel, and the mechanism is vulnerability.</p>
<p>There are passages on <i>In Colour</i> where the music is huge and anthemic while being simultaneously open and intimate. Opening track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17397-jamie-smith-gosh/"">""Gosh""</a> is the table-setter. It builds, one loop upon the next, each new brick of groove slotting into place, until it becomes a sky-scraping edifice whose call-to-motion is impossible to resist. And then, just as the last tightly-bound fixture is put into place, there comes a squelchy, slightly awkward synthesizer solo that sounds like it was knocked off in one hurried take by someone who approaches the instrument with the excitement of a newcomer. When the keyboard falls in, which is still exciting and surprising after many dozens of plays, it’s as if our tower of sound is suddenly crowned by a massive cluster of balloons that lifts it into the sky, <i>Up</i> style.</p>
<p>The view from this vantage point never flags. ""Sleep Sound"" takes a sample of the Four Freshmen’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iggWvFgp3KE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It’s a Blue World""</a> and gently cuts it into pieces, the voice tumbling through time in a manner not unlike what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxgYJE3HqNA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Field’s Axel Willner</a> did to the Flamingos' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvzNeh4Mq1o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Only Have Eyes for You""</a>, but the whole thing is filtered and submerged, a dream of water that’s soothing even as it hints of drowning. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17485-jamie-xx-i-know-theres-gonna-be-good-times-ft-young-thug-and-popcaan/"">""I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)""</a> features rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> and dancehall vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32156-popcaan/"">Popcaan</a> and while the combination of the three was iffy on paper, they wind up clicking. Thug is bursting with joy as he delivers profane couplets in his sing-song cadence, and Popcaan grounds the music and forms a bridge to the ragga of Jamie xx’s jungle heroes. As the album moves on, Jamie xx moves through styles and textures, everything unified by his highly attuned ear.</p>
<p>Three tunes find Jamie xx collaborating with his bandmates, and, like ""Good Times"", they show how well he straddles the line between ""song"" and ""track."" ""Stranger in a Room"", featuring Oliver Sim, could be a (very good) xx song and is the only thing here that seems like it could have come from the band. Romy’s melody on ""SeeSaw"" is all hushed confession mixed with longing, but instead of spare guitar and drums, Jamie xx surrounds it with breakbeats and a pulsing synth that suggests the cosmos, merging the closest possible feelings with the vastness of the infinite. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17398-jamie-smith-loud-places-ft-romy/"">""Loud Places""</a>, making brilliant use of a sample of jazz drummer Idris Muhammad’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yiMY1OARQU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Could Heaven Ever Be Like This""</a>, is a song of contrast in the manner of ""SeeSaw"". But the sample on ""Loud Places"" is warmer and more inclusive, and it’s followed by a brilliantly simple lyric about club-going loneliness and desire that might make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"">Morrissey</a> jealous: ""I go to loud places/ To search for someone/ To be quiet with.""</p>
<p>That clash of feeling, of being overwhelmed by everything at once while also wanting to zoom in on and live inside the tiniest detail, is the animating force of <i>In Colour</i>. Late in the album, the rush comes to a head on ""The Rest Is Noise"", a track that functions as the flipside to ""Gosh"", the party turned inside out, as shouting abandon gives way to a huge wash of yearning. There’s even a small nod to ""Gosh""’s synth break as the album seems to return from where it started. It makes me think of a comment from Jamie xx regarding one of the record’s most modest tracks, ""Obvs"", which is is driven by a steel drum lead. Jamie xx is fascinated by the instrument and has returned to it regularly, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/profiles/9649-jamie-xx-taking-shelter-in-loud-places/"">describing</a> its appeal like this: ""You can make it sound quite melancholy…but at the same time, it reminds me of paradise."" It’s not a bad description of how <i>In Colour </i>works. It’s the album as raucous party where the thrill of the moment never <i>quite</i> obliterates the wistful sadness that comes from knowing it will all end too soon.</p></div>"|20458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20458-in-colour/|9.3|Mark Richardson

Raised in the American South, they personify the foot-stomped physicality, call-and-response communiques, and outsized oration of the church, but their music is the anti-gospel. Rather than promote uplift, out-of-body ecstasy, and communion with the heavens, Algiers weigh you down with the burden of American history, a despair born of centuries of systemic oppression, and the soul-crushing futility of hoping for a change that never comes. Though they project the righteous indignation required of all great protest music, their music doesn’t so much represent a raised fist as a shoulder aching from the stress of trying to keep it aloft.</span></p>
<p>On <a href=""http://algierstheband.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>their website</span></a>, Algiers present a crazy quilt of musical and philosophical touchstones, which include everyone from Malcolm X and Angela Davis to Alejandro Jodorowsky and Basquiat to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a> and Ian Svenonius. Their music is likewise a pastiche of transgressive rock signifiers: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpWmlRNfLck"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>the soul-powered activism</span></a> of early '70s Motown, the proto-punk fury of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"">MC5</a>, the synth primitivism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>, the biblically charged drama of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9690-the-bad-seeds/"">the Bad Seeds</a>. But if the 11 songs on Algiers’ self-titled debut draw from familiar record-collector reference points, they’re radicalized by the context in which they’re being presented. Algiers are hardly the first biracial band to emerge from the indie-rock industrial complex, however, they are distinguished by their eagerness to make discussions of race the foundation of their ideological agenda, the gasoline-soaked fuse that sets their songs alight. For Algiers, signing to <a href=""http://www.matadorrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matador</a> isn’t just a means to reach more people; it’s an opportunity to thrust the modern African-American experience in the faces of an audience who rarely have to grapple with it.</p>
<p>Though steeped in Southern tradition, Algiers could not exist without all mod cons: with frontman Franklin James Fisher now based in New York, and guitarist Lee Tesche and bassist Ryan Mahan situated in London, the trio pieced the album together through transatlantic file swaps, atop bed tracks built through programmed beats or their own hyperactive hands and feet. But while the band have taken the somewhat inevitable step of recruiting a proper drummer—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"">Bloc Party</a>’s Matt Tong—for their current North American tour, the songs on <span>Algiers</span><span> hardly feel like rough sketches begging for full-band embellishment. The brittle beats are crucial to establishing the album’s often suffocating atmosphere: on the mournful opener ""Remains"", a chain-gang stomp provides a none-too-subtle evocation of America’s slave-trading past, while Fisher’s anti-television invective highlights the modern form of captivity that’s replaced it; the we-shan’t-overcome dejection of ""Blood"" is chillingly framed by a tambourine rattle and handclap that feel like lashes from a whip. ""Four hundred years of torture, four hundred years a slave,"" Fisher seethes on the latter song, as Tesche’s spasmodic guitar squeals emit sparks. But the noise ultimately relents, and the beat goes on, all while Fisher ruefully repeats the line ""all my blood’s in vain.""<br/></span></p>
<p>Though Algiers’ debut is dropping in the midst of a flashpoint in American race relations, Fisher’s lyrics avoid ripped-from-the-headlines reportage for a more existential angst. These songs were written before Ferguson and Baltimore, but they ultimately exist to remind us that such flare-ups aren’t the shocking aberrations that news networks make them out to be, but the inevitable, recurring spillover of a frustration that’s been simmering for centuries and will continue to in perpetuity. Accordingly, the savvily sequenced <i>Algiers</i><span> ebbs and flows between moments of gritted-teeth tension and furious release, its solemn, confession-booth ruminations offset by heart-racing, steeple-toppling rave-ups—like ""And When You Fall"", ""Old Girl"", and the </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDCYjb8RHk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>planet-rockin’</span></a><span> ""Irony. Utility. Pretext.""—that fulfill the prophecy of a </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/fVyVIsvQoaE?t=4m2s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>power-music electric revival</span></a><span> anticipated by some fellow Atlantans 15 years ago. While their messaging can sometimes be overshadowed by pulpit-thrashing theatrics (see: the provocatively titled but erratic ""Black Eunuch""), Algiers can also harness their jittery energy to sublime effect: the piano-powered dub strut ""But She Was Not Flying"" contrasts the album’s most relaxed, easy-going rhythm with Fisher’s most incendiary, exasperated vocal performance, representing the mid-album peak where Algiers truly find their groove.</span></p>
<p>Despite their gravely serious demeanor and fierce intellect—this band doesn’t so much give interviews as <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/17726-algiers-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>present thesis defenses</span></a><span>—Algiers ultimately value accessibility: from the participatory hand-clapped hysterics to their callback-ready refrains to their conflation of church congregations and circle pits, these songs beg for audience engagement and strength-in-numbers support. And if the album proves unrelentingly pessimistic in its worldview, Algiers do at least leave us with the faintest of silver linings. As the closing untitled instrumental takes the form of a thick, disorienting ambient fog, an early-'70s sample of <a href=""http://youtu.be/eyG-UEPjtX0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chicago pastor T.L. Barrett leading his Youth for Christ choir</a> in an exultant chorus gradually fades into the mix and eventually overwhelms the track, as if to chase away the album’s dense, dark cloud cover with a ray of light. Algiers are never so naive as to assure us that a change is gonna come but, as that brief denouement suggests, in their hardened hearts, they haven’t completely given up on the possibility.</span></p></div>"|20412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20412-algiers-algiers/|7.7|Stuart Berman

It's both an introductory passage to <i>Before We Forgot How to Dream</i> and a mission statement for the work. Throughout the LP, SOAK revels in her own uncertainty, basking in the openness of her future. Sometimes her music's meandering quality gives it a wistful charm, but sometimes it just drifts.</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike the woodsy, barebones EPs that preceded it, <i>Dream</i> comes padded with airy production. Behind Monds-Watson's guitar and voice, cymbals, strings, and bright spats of piano crash together. Sometimes they add an uptempo kick to songs that can't quite support the speed, like the pounding ""Garden"", whose melodies and lyrics don't move nearly as fast as its drum beats. ""I'd take you everywhere if I could/ I'd waste all my time on you,"" SOAK sings, and while the instrumentation's anxiety rakes against the words, it's not enough of an irony to drag them out of cliche.</span></p>
<p><span>When the ornamentation falls back into the mist, the idiosyncrasies of Monds-Watson's voice emerge more clearly. One of the album's most haunted and tender moments, ""24 Windowed House"" holds off on the bombast until the last possible moment. The song cracks open, and giant cymbal crashes underscore SOAK's uneasy lyrics. ""I am afraid of sleep,"" she sings. On ""SHUVELS"", her voice doubles over itself in a queasy echo as she pleads, ""If you're not around now/ Where do I go instead?"" The song doesn't let that final question hang, though; Monds-Watson's guitar and a slate of flutes come to rest on a major chord, taking the edge off her ennui.</span></p>
<p><span>There seem to be so many questions stirring inside SOAK, and yet <i>Before We Forgot How to Dream</i> douses them in so much prettiness that they lose their spark. It's a polished debut, but what's most interesting about it lurks beneath that shine. Monds-Watson writes like she's ready to fall in love and get her heart broken a hundred times over—like she's hungry to feel everything the way a lot of 18-year-olds are hungry to feel everything. ""When you're young and reckless/ You should not be stopped,"" she sings on ""Reckless Behaviour"". That recklessness lies inside <i>Before We Forgot How to Dream</i>, but it takes a little squinting to glimpse. </span></p></div>"|20551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20551-before-we-forgot-how-to-dream/|6.3|Sasha Geffen

It was a blare of frenetic energy and rhythmic bludgeoning. Beneath all the prog-punk brutality lurked actual song structures, the kind that could easily hypnotize anyone with the patience to uncover them. But no matter how long you stuck with them, AIDS Wolf always managed to incite dizziness through chaos.</p>
<p>In his solo project Drainolith, AIDS Wolf guitarist Alexander Moskos has a similar goal, but comes at it from an opposite side. Where his former band built an in-your-face wall, Moskos’ sound is all skeleton. The moving parts and overlapping shapes that motor his songs are in clear view. He’s not afraid to get dense and noisy too, but you can always hear a Drainolith tune being built, each element working to find its place. Beats fall down and get back up; shards of guitar riffs build into loops; somnambulant moans glide by, then dive into the music’s crevices.</p>
<p>On <i>Hysteria</i>, the follow-up to Drainolith’s 2012 debut <i>Fighting!</i>, everything emerges in semi-slow motion. It’s as if there's a faster, tighter version of these songs out there somewhere that Moskos could catch up to if he felt like it. But he’s more interested in wrestling the ghosts of those imagined tunes than inhabiting their bodies. The effect is disorienting but intoxicating—music designed to sneak up rather than overwhelm.</p>
<p>Especially mesmerizing is the way Moskos fuses together melodies while simultaneously wrenching them apart. It feels like you should be able to hum along to these songs—and in places you can—but it's all skewed enough to dodge predictability. Moskos grafts together parts that don’t naturally fit in a way that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a>’s misshapen anti-songs, but his aura is much woozier, almost lethargic. Yet <i>Hysteria</i> rarely settles into grooves that allow passive listening. Moskos may sound like a stoner, but that's because he wants you to feel foggy and confused rather than comfortable.</p>
<p>This smoky haze comes across in Moskos’ words, too. During ""Inside and Outside (Bog’s Blues)"", he sounds like he’s not even sure he’s awake: ""The structure of my sleep/ Is different this time,"" he slurs, practically drooling onto the pillow. In the drifting, beat-less ""Joy Road"", he whispers that ""Sometimes it seems like everything’s/ Moving too damn fast.../ Slow it down/ Move the ground/ Watch it shake."" Moskos’ zombified delivery recalls the sleep-walk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1411-excepter/"">Excepter</a>’s John Fell Ryan. But where that band often sounds like deconstructed disco, Drainolith is more like fractured rock—rock whose muscles have been stretched so much its bones dislodge and rattle against each other.</p>
<p>There’s also a hint of broken blues to <i>Hysteria</i> that recalls the more drug-addled side of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"">Royal Trux</a>. That’s not surprising, since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1871-neil-michael-hagerty/"">Neil Michael Hagerty</a> produced this session, which also resulted in the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32429-danl-boone/"">Dan’l Boone</a> record featuring Hagerty, Moskos, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"">Wolf Eyes’</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30040-nate-young/"">Nate Young</a>. But such comparisons just reveal Moskos’ very particular take on rock, an approach that resolutely eschews expected patterns. The result is a kind of blissful cognitive dissonance, making <i>Hysteria</i>’s 25 minutes feel wonderfully longer.</p></div>"|20563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20563-hysteria/|7.5|Marc Masters

His squealing solo takes a simple riff for a short, jubilant ride, as if he’s a glam-metal headliner leaning back with his eyes closed. He pushes notes together and pulls them apart, the carousel-like movement of the melody suggesting delight in the face of death. Like most of <i>Aria of Vernal Tombs</i>, the captivating second album by Anderson’s metal-and-medieval-music amalgam Obsequiae, ""Anlace and Heart"" explores cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. Greek gods battle with nervous mortals. Seasons shift, so that needles drop from tired tamarack branches. People weep as once-happy homes succumb to senescence. Jumping between black metal and doom, death metal and delicate interludes played on a medieval harp, the music animates all of these ideas, turning centuries of dark thoughts into 44 bright, momentous minutes.</p>
<p>Anderson appears to be invested in intersections, or what the lessons of the past can say about the present and what seemingly disconnected forms of music (metal and otherwise) can afford one another. He has clocked nearly two decades in the metal underground, that time split between the grim doom act Celestiial and Obsequiae precursor Autumnal Winds. Recently, he’s been playing harp and assorted acoustic instruments in <a href=""http://jwalton.bandcamp.com/album/hyalite-canyon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hiraeth Eschar</a>, the eerie soundscape project of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4892-agalloch/"">Agalloch</a> bassist Jason William Walton. At last, <i>Aria of Vernal Tombs</i> aggregates and unifies all those experiences, synthesizing them into songs that fold Anderson’s passions into singular sweeping motions. Obsequiae’s previous album, <i>Suspended in the Brume of Eos</i>, aimed for a similar end, but it often felt self-conscious and separated, its rigid parts coexisting on a record rather than cooperating. (It’s symptomatic of that record’s try-hard approach that <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69678/Blondel-de-Nesle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anderson</a> and the <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/408270/Neidhart-von-Reuenthal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">band’s former drummer</a> took the names of prominent 12th-century musicians in the credits.) But on <i>Aria, </i>where most tracks interlock with their neighbors, the vivid black metal of ""Wilweorthunga"" flows perfectly from the triumphant solo that closes ""In the Absence of Light"" and into a pensive, dense instrumental meditation. That sequence captures the sprawl of Anderson’s interests in less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Metal has a dirty habit of embracing bygone eras and appropriating historic symbols and stories without actually incorporating how those times <i>might</i> have sounded or felt into the music. It’s easy and alluring to slap a painting of a Viking feast or an ancient battle scene on a record cover or a name in a song title, more sophisticated and subtle to make those elements a dynamic and vital component of the finished product. Obsequiae plunders the past, of course. <a href=""https://f1.bcbits.com/img/a2987037651_10.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The cover of their debut</a> featured a detail of a 15th-century fresco, where a regal woman posed among unicorns and other strange, smiling beasts. Likewise, <i>Aria of Vernal Tombs </i>offers a gorgeous scene of ruins at the gloaming. And a third of <i>Aria</i>’s tracks are atmospheric harp solos, augmented only by the glow of echo.</p>
<p>But the real power of <i>Aria of Vernal</i> <i>Tombs</i> stems from how deliberately and diligently Obsequiae integrate these elements into the main event—that is, the metal. Anderson’s methodical grammar, antiquated vocabulary, and rich reference library offer the impression that you’re opening an ancient, sealed text. It’s no coincidence that the liner notes come printed on stained paper that appears to be centuries old. Sure, that sounds pretentious, but the same principle actually makes the music thrilling. The guitar solos, for instance, often mirror the action of the harp, and vice versa. At the opening of ""Anlace and Heart"", Anderson’s pace and polyphony suggest the interlocking melodies of Vincent la Camera Mariño’s harp interludes. The album opens with a harp piece, the notes piling into thickets and then spreading into thin strings. When a bell tolls after three minutes and the grand anthem ""Autumnal Pyre"" begins, it seems less like a new song and more like Anderson and drummer Andrew Della Cagna have simply replaced Mariño. Anderson sings through refracted black metal shrieks. The drums swing between blast beats and an unwavering march. Topped with arching, heroic guitars, however, the music is of a piece with its instrumental predecessor, a modern update of several classic obsessions. The past becomes more than a sales pitch.  </p>
<p>Despite Anderson’s longevity, he and his bands have existed in relative obscurity to date. But <i>Aria of Vernal Tombs </i>should help change that.

As it’s grown easier to translate our identities through these careful assemblages of stuff we fuck with, good taste has taken on a new leveraging power. A$AP Rocky, the baby-faced <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6VfsJ7LAlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>fashion killa</span></a> and primary figurehead of zeitgeist-wheelie-poppin’ Harlem goon squad <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30605-aap-mob/"">A<span>$</span>AP Mob</a>, has always understood this better than anyone else in the rap game. As he should: his own success can be directly traced to early promo on his mentor and A<span>$</span>AP Worldwide co-owner A<span>$</span>AP Yams’ highly influential <i>RealNiggaTumblr</i>, one of the savviest indie-to-major reconnaissance missions this century. That triumph of personal taste has been one of the reasons Rocky’s resonated most with this generation of rap fans and beyond, but it’s also led to his most persistent critique: all vibe, no substance. In between the conceptual <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/aap-rocky--2/85645"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Instagram stunts</span></a> and <i>Harry Potter</i>-themed <a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/02/asap-rocky-fashion-is-just-like-harry-potter.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>sartorial wisdom</span></a>, it’s hard not to wonder about the Rakim Mayers beneath the swaggy labels, and if we’d ever get a lasting impression of his point of view beyond the infinite affirmations that it is, indeed, lit.</p>
<p>There’s been a two-plus year gap between Rocky’s sophomore studio album, <i>At.Long.Last.ASAP</i>, and his chart-topping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17505-longliveaap/""><span>major label debut</span></a>, during which he dabbled in fashion design, <a href=""http://www.ferragamo.com/manstory/en/usa/asap-rocky"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">modeled</a> for Ferragamo, and made his acting debut in Sundance darling <i><a href=""http://deadline.com/2015/01/dope-seven-million-dollars-open-road-sundance-film-festival-1201357907/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dope</a></i>. But the most glaring change between then and now is the absence of Yams, or Steven Rodriguez, who died this January at 26 of a drug overdose. Yams’ presence was mostly behind-the-scenes (though he’d often <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLCf-URqIf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>appear</span></a> in the videos, in all his jiggy splendor), but he was the heart and soul of the A<span>$</span>AP Mob, and Rocky’s success is no short of unfathomable without his guidance. With <i>A.L.L.A.</i>—executive produced by Yams, along with art-rap auteur <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"">Danger Mouse</a>—he presents to the world one last relic of he and his best friend’s collaborative vision, and though the album was reportedly completed before Yams’ death, it still feels like an elegy to the closest thing the millennial generation had to its own Diddy or Dame Dash.</p>
<p>Rocky remained understandably private in the aftermath of Yams’ passing, but on <i>A.L.L.A.</i><span>, he seems more open than ever: to the healing properties of hallucinogens, to be sure, but also to revealing parts of his personality that go beyond surface-level. To an extent, this may reflect his recent </span><a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/11/aap-rocky-expands-on-his-hood-by-air-beef.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>antipathy</span></a><span> towards the much-hyped labels with which he once associated. But it seems more likely a result of growing up, gaining steadier footing in the industry his squad gate-crashed, and coming to terms with himself as more than just a sum of his inspirations and logos. At long last, a real sense of identity has begun to coalesce in Rocky’s work. </span></p>
<p>""Ok, let’s get past all this swag, trapping, and fashion talking,"" he exhales on back-to-basics <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> collab ""Jukebox Joints"". Turns out, Pretty Flacko’s got real shit to say—though not without the buffer of some par-for-the-course bits of pretty-sounding fluff—and he wastes little time getting to it. Album intro ""Holy Ghost"" serves as an indictment of the Christian clergy, a grasp towards his own jaded conception of a personal Jesus, and a plea to save his admittedly corrupted soul all the same. It’s clear he’s been sharpening his rap skills on a technical level, too. On ""Pharsyde"", over a screwed-up take on Danger Mouse’s loping Spaghetti Westernisms, Rocky punctuates a sideways glance at his rapidly gentrifying Uptown kingdom with a <a href=""http://www.spin.com/2013/02/baauers-harlem-shake-gentrification-goes-viral/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">loaded</a> ""Harlem Shake"" reference, the kind of nuanced writing absent from much of his older work. On ""Max B"", he turns a neck-snapping homage to the incarcerated <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_B"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wavie One</a> into a commentary on remorseless cops and the prison-industrial complex with newfound lyrical command: ""Passed away from a stray from some fake-tough guy/ Now this the kinda story that should make doves cry.""</p>
<p><i>A.L.L.A</i>’s recent singles are among its least interesting moments. All that’s missing from ""L$D""'s on-the-nose dorm room psychedelia are the dryer sheets MacGyvered around the smoke detector, though the track makes more sense in album context as something of an extended interlude than it did as a standalone. And ""Everyday"", with its headline-grabbing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14130-rod-stewart/"">Rod Stewart</a> mash-up, feels like an overt attempt at a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt0g4dWxEBo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""FourFiveSeconds""</span></a>-style genre-busting flex, though its transitions are as clunky and unresolved as PowerPoint slide changes. Not to say the album isn’t without hits: lead single ""Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LBFJ2)"" is a monster, with its hulking, siren-heavy production from drill production duo Nez &amp; Rio, and ""Electric Body"", with old partner in crime <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q/"">Schoolboy Q</a>, seems destined for club tenure this summer. Still, it’s one of this year’s growing list of major rap releases—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20529-barter-6/"">Thug</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20271-if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late/"">Drake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/"">Kendrick</a>—seemingly unconcerned with landing anything on the radio.</p>
<p>Even without the overt grabs for mainstream relevance à la ""Fuckin' Problems"", <i>A.L.L.A.</i> isn’t short on star power, and Rocky’s coaxed some impressive features from his sprawling guest roster. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a> steadily gathers momentum on ""M’$"", barrelling downhill through break-neck plug talk and landing breathlessly at a final fuck-you to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12128-birdman/"">Birdman</a> (""I love my YM, ain’t no more CM""). On album highlight ""Fine Whine"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a> shakes up a syrupy half-time lurch to spit, ""Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick!"" with a mouthful of <a href=""http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/01/04/katy-perry-dating-diplo-secret-relationship-reason/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>bad blood</span></a>. On the same song, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> Hendrix (who’s been making it cool to be <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Future-FreeBand-Gang-Black-Woodstock-The-Soundtrack-mixtape.479825.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">psychedelic and street</a> for years now) delivers his realest post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"">Ciara</a> guest verse yet. That ""Wavybone"" revives <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5406-ugk/"">UGK</a> over a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a> co-production—and that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2838-mos-def/"">Yasiin Bey</a> shows up at all on the closing track—are curatorial flexes in their own right.</p>
<p>But <i>A.L.L.A.</i>’s most unexpected presence is <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/05/get-to-know-joe-fox/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Joe Fox</span></a>, a previously unknown songwriter and guitarist who Rocky scooped off the streets of London and fashioned into his protege, and who appears on almost a third of the album. It’s a weird move, on an album full of them. Until now, Rocky’s adhered to a painstakingly calculated idea of ""cool."" On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17505-longliveaap/""><i>Long.Live.A$AP</i></a>, you got the sense his eclectic, of-the-moment features roster were a pointed statement as to how he’d like to be perceived, an itemized breakdown of the context in which he envisioned his own artistry. But <i>A.L.L.A.</i> frequently wanders from overt coolness towards choices that are emphatically off-trend: Danger Mouse, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5304-mark-ronson/"">Mark Ronson</a>, Rod Stewart, a sample from a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glQmHBn34GA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>'60s Christmas ditty</span></a> on ""Excuse Me"". It’s a welcome change of pace for the former <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YynhRxRZNX4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Raf Simons Murderer</span></a>, as the self-aware tastemaking takes a backseat to hopes, anxieties, tremors of sociopolitical unrest—a beating heart beneath the Rick Owens linens. Instead of a hyper-curated tableau of swag, Rocky’s curatorial eye adopts a more intimate gaze, rendering his collage of disparate inspirations more like a mixtape made for a friend than a sterile exhibition space. This is where his late mentor’s <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/01/asap-yams-mixes-compilations"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>influence</span></a> shines brightest: Yams’ point of view was so piercing and confident it effortlessly transcended the sum of his influences, proving emphatically that you are more than the shit you like.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-d3d7b2e0-9bcf-5851-69a6-72b36f54d2e7""><span>The last thing we hear, even after Yams’ ranted outro closes with a triumphant ""ASAP, bitch!,"" is what sounds like an encroaching train, or a shrieking hangover due to hit any minute now, or maybe just reality about to set in. After the party, the afterparty, and the acid-fueled </span><a href=""http://nypost.com/2015/05/23/aap-rocky-had-three-acid-fueled-orgies-at-sxsw/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>marathon orgy</span></a><span> thereafter, the most surreal part of a trip is inevitably the moment you have to rub your eyes and go be a real adult.

Or an aspect of it: at the core of Frankie's music was his work as a DJ, and it's heartbreaking that future generations will be denied the experience of his dancefloors. Much like the genre he forged in parties at the Warehouse in the late 1970s and early 1980s, his work as a producer was an extension of the singular sensibility of a man behind turntables. Frankie Knuckles' credits as a producer will secure his legacy in his absence, even as they remain bronzed touchpoints in a grander journey.</p>
<p>Although it's not the first compilation of Frankie's production work, <i>House Masters</i> is by some distance the most ambitious. Earlier summations focused on his groundbreaking material of the 1980s, when songs like ""Baby Wants to Ride"" (which also appears here) and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PuP6lgah_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's a Cold World""</a> (which does not) were part of house music's big bang; when each new record contained the DNA of thousands to follow. But the <a href=""http://defected.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Defected</a> label's <i>House Masters</i>—the profits from which benefit the <a href=""http://newyork.ejaf.org/in-memory-of-frankie-knuckles/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Knuckles Fund/Elton John AIDS Foundation</a>—looks at the bigger picture of Knuckles' recording career, spanning from early records like ""Your Love"" (originally heard during Frankie's sets at the Power Plant in the mid-1980s) all the way to 2011's shimmering, quivering ""I'll Take You There"".</p>
<p>Those two records, both of which feature the yearning vocals of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17728-jamie-principle/"">Jamie Principle</a>, bookend this compilation, an argument for the continuity of Knuckles' vision across four different decades—five if we consider the groundwork he laid as a DJ at the Warehouse in the late 1970s. Rather than pay lip service to his longevity while highlighting a narrow fraction of it,<i> House Masters</i> treats his formative years as first steps in a lifelong journey as a recording artist. House music may have de-emphasized artist-driven careers in favor of democratic dancefloors, but taking a focused look at Frankie Knuckles as an auteur with a lengthy résumé not only unearths forgotten singles deserving of more attention, but refracts back upon his earliest, most well known material, pulling new insights from well-worn releases.</p>
<p>That is, if you purchase the CD version. Due to licensing restrictions, the version of <i>House Masters</i> available digitally in the United States switches out certain records in favor of others, and appends two bonus tracks. This alternate tracklist doesn't feature any bad songs, but it's a much less cohesive listen. The success of this compilation, appropriately for an artist who was a DJ first and foremost, is as much about its meta-narrative—the deliberate shape of the project as a whole, and what it says about Frankie's career. Defected has said as much in the press around the project, which suggests Frankie was responsible for <a href=""http://defected.com/news/house-masters-frankie-knuckles/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""hand-selecting""</a> the records that made the cut. He passed away a month after planning began, and while the label isn't specific about his contributions to its final state, whoever did sign off built the original tracklist with care. The alternate version, despite adding two additional songs, has moments of incoherence: the emotional punch of Rufus and Chaka Khan's house dub ""Ain't Nobody (Hallucinogenic Version)"" feels like a lynchpin of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycnuyo3MLbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">original</a>, and hearing Quentin Harris and Ultra Naté's ""Give It 2 U (Frankie Knuckles' Gagatha Christie Mix)"" in its place is disorienting.</p>
<p>Whether you're a house novice or a dance music savant, <i>House Masters</i> (in its original form) inscribes a new and invigorating story about who Frankie Knuckles was, and who he will be for the future. If one quality connects the disparate sounds of his work from every era, snaking its way through the full range of his discography, it is a sensation of expressive confidence. Too often confused with the self-serious theater of masculinity, for Frankie, confidence was about muscular vulnerability, both as an m.o. and the texture of his art. Take, for example, 1983's driving edit of First Choice's 1977 disco classic ""Let No Man Put Asunder"", a stand-in here for his earliest days as a disco DJ. Although he wasn't the first to extend the 4 minute 30 second record into dancefloor-friendly shape (Walter Gibbons <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGARIt4I85o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixed it</a> several years earlier), Frankie's had the more forceful groove, pointing to the direction Chicago would soon shift the country.</p>
<p>The self-assuredness of his early work helps explain how a New York DJ who'd moved to a far-flung flyover like Chicago dramatically reoriented the sound of dance music nationally. In the city of broad shoulders, where the streets are wide and even Chicago's classical trumpet players are known for their large-bore, powerful <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_Herseth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chicago sound""</a>, Frankie Knuckles spread his wings as a DJ, and as this collection suggests, as a producer as well. As a compilation of mainly 6-8 minute house records, new listeners may initially struggle with what are essentially DJ tools—records Frankie designed for the dancefloors with which he was familiar. Many of his records, as peak time anthems for the party's emotional climax, ask for complete investment: where a pop DJ might spin records for an audience merely chasing the familiar, Knuckles' records are ornate and expansive, intended to be experienced <i>in toto</i>, appreciated for the flowering shape of the whole.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best example is the grandeur of Sounds of Blackness' 1991 single ""The Pressure (Frankie Knuckles Classic Mix)"". Knuckles doesn't merely dare the audience to adjust to its slow, extended piano intro, but tests their patience, boldly indulging in theatrical sincerity, with rolling gospel pianos and an arching vocal performance from Ann Bennett-Nesby. Knuckles—or any DJ with concomitant confidence and a copy of this record—creates a compact with the dancer: not only will you be rewarded for this long delay, not only will you start to appreciate this delay as a part of the experience of dancing—but that intro becomes, retroactively, the record's real hook. It's the moment where full investment actually takes place—the moment trust is built, where the DJ leads, and the audience learns to follow.</p>
<p>""The Pressure"" is also a perfect example of how Knuckles' remixes could enhance and deepen the colors of a record. One of the greatest tricks in his toolbox were those familiar rounded bass tones, like bumpers on a pinball machine, which often served as powerful emotional reassurance. Their use may shift with context: on ""The Whistle Song"", the flute searches for a memory while the bass lopes forward playfully; on Adeva's ""Beautiful Love"", what could be a melancholy record becomes one of wistful acceptance. On his remix of R&amp;B classic ""Hangin' on a String"", the bassline helps untangle Loose Ends' knot of ambiguity into joyous dancing strands, a celebration of unapologetic devotion as the height of romantic love. Unapologetic <i>confident</i> devotion: not just acceptance, but an embrace, as if savoring every flavor of having surrendered to the crush.</p>
<p>Like a good DJ mix, this compilation is not wanting for variety; Knuckles' sleek refashioning of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5681-hercules-and-love-affair/"">Hercules and Love Affair</a>'s ""Blind"" makes the song more intimate, a sunset breeze brushing the skin; the next record—Frankie's own ""Workout (1992 Vocal Mix)""—drips with sweat, all urgent physicality, like a clubgoer's version of the runner's high. The classic ""Let the Music (Use You)"" explores a solitary experience: as the keyboards flash like passing car lights from the back seat of a taxi cab, Frankie conjures urban nightlife as a lonely, seductive promise. Some may ponder what's missing; where is ""It's a Cold World"", a paranoiac moment from his early days? <i>House Masters</i> leaves stones unturned, but it's apt to encourage this ambition from new listeners, who should know there is more to explore. In context, it's tough to imagine that ""Cold World"" would fit in with the records here; in exploring his life, perhaps Frankie simply felt it wasn't the world he lived in any longer.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's the feeling that Knuckles is so powerfully <i>present</i> in each of these songs, that each one is in some way intimately, generously, lovingly alive, which connects his work throughout the years. A record like ""Your Love"", familiar and canonized as it might be, isn't that close to house music's aesthetic core: it shows the influence of Italo-disco, its unconventional groove suggesting some possible future unexplored. But that sensation of warmth, the feeling of a heartbeat's proximity, makes it contiguous with his catalog. Frankie's true innovations seem invisible now; he wasn't responsible for the sonic distortions Ron Hardy explored at the druggy Music Box. Frankie's sensibility hewed closer to its gospel and disco roots. At one time, he stood at the margins, held a radical position. That we see his later work as ""conservative"" is a trick of perspective. It's not that he pulled back as he refined his craft; it's that we all moved to follow him at a new center.</p>
<p>A true gem cruelly banished from the U.S. digital version is Lisa Stansfield's ""Change (Knuckles Mix)""—which feels as much like a message from Frankie himself, a crucial farewell before submitting to the whimsical high drama of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"">Pet Shop Boys</a>' ""Left to My Own Devices (Frankie Knuckles Royal Piano Version)"". ""If I could change the way I live my life today, I wouldn't change a single thing,"" Stansfield sings—it's hard not to read messages from Frankie himself in the songs he chose here, messages from beyond. It's not an unprecedented trick, especially for a DJ. As Stansfield's vocals unfurl from whispers to a fast vibrato, she's wreathed in ribbons of strings, a delicate performance that is nonetheless totally inhabited, reaching outward, in full bloom.</p></div>"|20545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20545-various-artists-frankie-knuckles-house-masters/|9.0|David Drake

Since they emerged from west London in 2010, the four-piece have studiously avoided trying too hard with their blunted rock and disaffected lyrics that made frontman Justin Young’s internal life sound devoid of joy or rage. Their only aims appeared to be careerist ones along the lines of getting </span><a href=""http://nme.assets.ipccdn.co.uk/images/gallery/NMEVaccinesCover040111.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""indie back in the charts,""</span></a><span> based on the notion of the honest underdog vanquishing pop’s preening one percent. But at some point following 2012’s </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16991-come-of-age/"">Come of Age</a></i><span>, the Vaccines realized that they had fallen foul of a self-limiting attitude.</span> </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Newly enlightened, Young started praising the adventurousness of hip-hop and pop, and bravely opted out of valuable patronage after <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/27/the-vaccines-the-who-at-glastonbury-is-such-a-safe-booking"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>decrying</span></a> the Who’s forthcoming Glastonbury headline slot as ""a safe booking."" They sought out Dave Fridmann along with former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"">Haunted Graffiti</a> member and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a> collaborator Cole M. Greif-Neill to work on their third album, on which they attempted to ""steer clear of a lot of the self-imposed rules that indie music implies,"" Icelandic bassist Árni Árnason <a href=""http://www.gigwise.com/features/100590/the-vaccines-interview-on-beyonce-jay-z-indie-and-english-graffiti"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> recently. Some of their fans were hesitant about the more tender, melancholy direction signalled on 2014’s stopgap <i>Melody Calling</i> EP, but to their credit, the Vaccines persevered with it (though they ditched an apparently wilder version that would have been <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/the-vaccines/85734"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""commercial suicide""</a>). The result is their best record yet. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Part of its success is due to the fact that the Vaccines sound borderline-unrecognizable here, which is probably curmudgeonly praise. Where Young’s vocals used to thud like a fist through a wet paper bag, he’s now found a warm centerpoint somewhere between Chris Martin’s nice-boy croon and Damon Albarn’s rougher edges. The record’s zippy rock songs are its least inspired moments—""Dream Love"" is a shadow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys/""><span>Arctic Monkeys</span></a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18386-arctic-monkeys-am/""><i>AM</i></a> swagger, and the synthy chorus to ""Minimal Affection"" rips off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">the Strokes</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17788-the-strokes-comedown-machine/""><i>Comedown Machine</i></a>—but for the most part, it settles somewhere unusual, if not original. (For better or worse, their <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/the-vaccines/80221"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aspirations</a> to sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3829-sleater-kinney/"">Sleater-Kinney</a> circa <i>The Woods</i> aren’t evident.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The run-up to <i>English Graffiti</i> was dogged by a quote Young <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/the-vaccines/82370"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gave to <i>NME </i></a>in January: ""We wanted to make something that sounds amazing next year but terrible in 10 years!"" The hyper-produced record has actually ended up somewhere in the mid-'80s, juxtaposing a surprising power-pop influence (the ripping ""Give Me a Sign"") with even more surprising shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>’s curious, muted balladry (""Minimal Affection"", ""Denial""). Although the Vaccines discovered there was more to creative fulfillment than playing London’s 20,000-cap O2 Arena, in equally '80s fashion, they’ve written two yearning songs fit for stadiums anyway: the sinewy ""Want U So Bad"" and ""Maybe I Could Hold You"", which sits somewhere between Arctic Monkeys and Coldplay and feels appropriately comforting.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Maybe there’s something in the water for major label British indie acts flipping the script as they approach their third records, though unlike Young’s old pals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford &amp; Sons</a> (from back in his days as troubadour Jay Jay Pistolet), the Vaccines couldn’t really be accused of selling out. As they have noted, they didn’t pay their dues in a scene (they were signed after a handful of gigs) and came up with no ethos beyond finding success. If anything, what <i>English Graffiti</i> does have that its predecessors sorely lacked is heart—the only measure of authenticity that really matters.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In a plaintive tone buried by distortion, Young starts the record on a similarly dispirited note to <i>Come of Age</i>. ""With a hollow embrace, let’s go back to your place/ Uncover a lover you cannot replace,"" he belts on ""Dream Lover"", retreading the fittingly empty pound of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU9hrd35Dsg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Post Break Up Sex""</a> from 2011 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15406-what-did-you-expect-from-the-vaccines/""><i>What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?</i></a>. So far, so dismal, but rather than wallow in the scorned self-pity that characterized their first two albums, Young starts searching for the root of his inability to connect. ""Hold on, I’m in denial/ I need an answer and have for a while,"" he croons on ""Denial"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Young recently talked about how his band wants to compete with the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a> to be considered one of the biggest and best acts in the world. ""We think that how they make music and how they connect with people is above and beyond anything we’ve ever experienced, but I want to be as important as what they’re saying and what they’re trying to achieve."" Who knows whether they’ll get there, but by making music that actually sounds important to them, the Vaccines have taken a small step in that direction.</p></div>"|20613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20613-english-graffiti/|6.3|Laura Snapes

Like hanging two mirrors opposite one another in a small room, it opens a window upon the infinite. Dub burrows an endlessly regenerating maze through the otherwise finite confines of the mixing desk. Paul Dickow's <i>Noise Tape Self</i> goes one step further: it tries to wring infinity out of a single cassette tape.</p>
<p>Dickow, who lives in Portland, Ore., has made a lot of different kinds of music over the years. His debut LP, 2003's <i>Strut</i>, was a homebrewed response to the blippy, squirrelly sounds then coming from UK labels like <a href=""http://www.planet.mu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Planet Mu</a> and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/107-Rephlex"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rephlex</a>. His '00s releases for <a href=""http://www.kranky.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kranky</a> veered into dubby ambient music indebted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3352-pole/"">Pole</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>. He's no stranger to the dance floor—disco and Afrobeat often linger at the edges of his music, beckoning—but he seems most at home in pursuit of headier ideals. On this year's <i>Seeds of Paradise</i>, for the Bristol bass-music label <a href=""http://www.idlehandsbristol.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Idle Hands</a>, and <i>Pods of Punishment</i>, for the experimentally inclined <a href=""http://www.entracte.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Entr'acte</a>, he has ventured ever deeper into a sound of his own making, one lying at the overlap of dub, ambient, and DIY electronics.</p>
<p><i>Noise Tape Self </i>is the most focused thing he's done, and it's also the most experimental. Its six tracks date from between 2008 and 2010, and all of them were made using an arcane system of Dickow's own devising. At the risk of getting too technical, it's worth explaining his process in some detail, simply because it's so inventive—and also because it's hard to fathom how such strict limitations could yield music this enveloping.</p>
<p>Using a technique developed by David Chandler, aka <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/379-Solenoid"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Solenoid</a>, Dickow first created his own looping cassettes by disassembling the plastic housings of cassette tapes, extracting the tape, cutting it, and re-threading it in a loop configuration. (These <a href=""http://www.cementimental.com/tapeloop.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">images</a> help explain the technique.) Those then became, in a sense, both his canvas and, when he recycled the contents of the tapes (many of which were often found on the street or given to him by friends), his raw material. Plugging those into a 4-track recorder, he recorded his own sounds and also utilized the existing material on the tapes, all of which he ran out, via separate outputs for each track, through a handful of effects: analog delay, high-pass filter, spring reverb, a broken loop pedal, and a tube overdrive built by Not Breathing's Dave Wright. (He diagrams his process <a href=""http://www.boomarmnation.com/strategy-talks-the-process/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Why does any of this matter? You can listen to all six of <i>Noise Tape Self</i>'s tracks on <a href=""http://furtherrecords.org/album/noise-tape-self"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> right now, so you tell me: Would you have guessed that any of these were the product of a single set of loops, all running in parallel? I doubt it. They move like water—not in circles but in long, winding streams, a muted rainbow of intermingled currents, some faster and some slower. Four parallel eight-second loops become, in effect, a series of garden stakes drowned in vines—overgrown, unruly, uncontainable.</p>
<p>""Awesome Piano"" is a sawtoothed raga suffused in mist, a gentle call-and-response between gravelly synthesizer and watery keys. ""Cassette Loop"" recalls both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5164-seefeel/"">Seefeel</a>'s spectral ambient dub and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>'s drain-circling drones; a rhythmic clacking suggests the movement of a train, while the glassy sway might be buoys far out at sea. That's as lonely as the album gets: ""Ominous Lovely Piano"" plays with whimsical, daydreamy loops—major-key, frayed around the edges—and something that sounds almost like a dog sighing in its sleep. ""Lovely Loop"", cooler and more distant, wouldn't be out of place on <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=pop+ambient"">Pop Ambient series</a>. It also has something of the aquatic to it, complete with the rustle of what might be waves and seagulls: If ""Cassette Loop"" is a fogged-in bay at night, then ""Lovely Loop"" is the same scene by the light of day, sun-baked and ringed by green pines. ""Hobgoblin"" employs the 4-track's variable-speed feature to create a spooky gliding melody, and the closing ""Rhen's Loop"" settles into nine minutes of resonant drones that glisten like a pit full of beetles.</p>
<p>None of these tracks deals explicitly in reggae—not its bass lines, not its backbeats—but the album's commitment to dub as a process, an ethos, is total. And it shows that dub, as a technique and a tradition, transcends musical styles; it reveals dub to be a kind of magic. The filters and delay act as both sieve and telescoping rod, catching sounds and propelling them out toward the limit of our perception; they wrest time from the rails and send it flying off into space. ""The studio must be like a living thing,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee ""Scratch"" Perry</a> told David Toop, and <i>Tape Noise Self </i>implants dub's DNA in a whole new host. As studios go, Dickow's couldn't be more modest, but there is no doubt that it is alive.</p></div>"|20550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20550-noise-tape-self/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

It has been earthly borders, though, that have shaped his sound. Born in Japan, he eventually found his way to Los Angeles during the peak years of the city’s beat scene, when the Low End Theory party was catching attention thanks to regulars such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"">the Gaslamp Killer</a>. Shibata hopped back across the Pacific Ocean last year, and he’s in Tokyo for the release of his debut EP □ (<i>Square</i>, to be exact). It’s a strong introduction to Kosmo Kat’s world, one where he applies the ethos of L.A.’s headier music communities to old and contemporary Japanese styles.</p>
<p>Shibata’s approach doesn’t immediately sound like anything ""a bunch of dudes hanging out and bobbing our heads together"" would listen to, as Gaslamp Killer described the early days of Low End Theory <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/music/low-end-theory-anniversary-2172682"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to <i>LA Weekly</i></a>. Kosmo Kat embraces pop full on, stacking his songs up with bright electronics that play out at a speed targeting the whole body. His 2013 digital EP <a href=""https://kosmokat.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>An Elegant Punk</i></a> glistened and zipped ahead, at times resembling the more frantic moments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/""><i>Cosmogramma</i></a> with the jazz touches swapped out for disco.</p>
<p>□ sonically doesn’t detour too far from his earlier days. Opener ""Aki ga Konai Kotoba"" skitters from the get-go, bursting into a dash come the chorus, as does the throbbing ""Nami"". They aren’t quite as technicolor as Shibata’s earlier recordings, but unfold at the same up-tempo pace. EP highlight ""Pterosaur"" veers into dreamier territory, thanks in large part to the hushed singing of Brooklyn-based guest vocalist <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/trust-in-love"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trust In Love</a>. Yet as intimate as ""Pterosaur"" gets, the music itself keeps thumping along, never allowing the song to dissolve into pure pillow talk.</p>
<p>Save for a few short interludes, □ doesn’t recall the actual heady sounds that came to define L.A.’s beat scene. Rather, Shibata seemingly absorbed the idea of taking something familiar to yourself and bending it in new ways. For Kosmo Kat, that’s Japanese pop. Abroad, J-Pop tends to be described as hectic, cute, and generally overwhelming, more or less the same experience of standing near a <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> machine for several minutes. Yet J-Pop contains multitudes of styles, and Shibata channels several varieties, from the intricate electro-pop of producer Yasutaka Nakata (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31764-capsule/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Capsule</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31566-kyary-pamyu-pamyu/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Kyary Pamyu Pamyu</a>) to the tightly constructed stylings of '80s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nUPxgMOk7w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">idol pop</a>. He puts his own spin on it, turning it into something all his own.</p>
<p>Shibata’s best touch—and the one major departure from the bulk of Kosmo Kat’s past sounds—is the addition of his own voice. ""Aki ga Kinai Kotoba"" is a fine bit of heart-skipping electronic music, but his singing, which moves from reserved to nearly shouted come the chorus, adds a drama to the song that gives it extra energy. The same goes for ""Nami"", which finds Shibata’s voice nearly cracking during the final stretch. Save for Trust In Love’s feature, all the vocals are sung in Japanese, and the way Shibata delivers those words sells the emotion and urgency more than well. Good pop, whether straightforward or warped around the edges, should achieve that.</p>
<p>□ works as a strong first introduction to Kosmo Kat, managing just the right pace over the course of its six songs (closer ""Kage no Kimi"" is a slow-burning ballad that would normally feel a bit meandering, yet is a welcome breath after the fast-paced tracks before it). Most impressively, it highlights a producer who avoids easy duplication of the sounds he’s been surrounded by during his life in favor of morphing them into a boundary-blurring form he can orbit himself.</p></div>"|20630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20630-square-ep/|7.1|Patrick St. Michel

He smuggles out music like contraband. It has become less about whether or not he’ll be able to produce while incarcerated and more about just how much music he can muster. Since his conviction on felony weapons charges in 2013, he’s supplied digital albums and mixtapes at a rate that’d make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a> blush, all while serving a sentence that won't see him released until early 2017. At times, his release schedule feels like a personal affront to the penal system, a boast that his now historically prolific output cannot be stifled, not even by a cell. In an effort to keep up this charade, though, the quality of his mush-mouthed oeuvre has been erratic at best and numbing at worst.</p>
<p>It seems during this current stint, his longest bid behind bars as a rapper and maybe the first where his relevance has been threatened, Gucci is releasing music more aimlessly than ever. Projects are compiled of old throwaways from long-forgotten hard drives. Mixtapes arrive one after the next or in packs with no consideration for consumer consumption. There is often little to no method to his madness. He releases new projects en masse simply for the sake of it. These days, it’s less about the music itself and more about how he rolls it out. But he’s been playing a game of diminishing returns: the more music a mercurial Gucci releases, the less people seem to check for it.</p>
<p>When they do, it’s because of the stunt itself. February produced an EP entitled <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Gucci-Mane-Views-From-Zone-6-EP-mixtape.690302.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Views From Zone 6</i></a>, an obvious play on the title of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>’s forthcoming album, which featured eyebrow-raising features from Andy Milonakis and the Based God. In March, he released <a href=""http://www.audiomack.com/album/roc585/breakfast"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Breakfast</i></a>, <a href=""http://www.audiomack.com/album/roc585/lunch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Lunch</i></a>, <a href=""http://www.audiomack.com/album/roc585/dinner"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Dinner</i></a>, and <a href=""http://www.audiomack.com/album/traps-n-trunks/dessert"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Dessert</i></a>, three albums and an EP which all did little to whet the appetite, but still received a sizable amount of coverage simply because of the grandness (and absurdity) of the gesture. On his last mixtape, <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Gucci-Mane-Trap-House-5-the-Final-Chapter-mixtape.700375.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Trap House 5 (The Final Chapter)</i></a>, he squandered nearly a dozen beats from Zaytoven only a few months removed from producing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>’s scintillating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20166-future-beast-mode/""><i>Beast Mode</i></a> tape. In an effort to preserve his image as a mixtape workhorse, Gucci is slowly becoming a caricature.</p>
<p>The general consensus surrounding Gucci Mane has always been that he’s limited by his inconsistency, a sentiment that resonates even louder now. On the title track from his newest mixtape, <i>King Gucci</i>, he hears those murmurs echoing: ""Some people say Guwop ain’t Gucci/ They say Bricksquad ain’t So Icy…/ What?!"" It’s a shot at any suggestion that he’s self-saturated to the point of being washed up or that he’s become a parody of his former self. There’s more disbelief in his voice than menace, as if to render the notion unthinkable. To that end, <i>King Gucci</i> feels like an attempt to reaffirm Gucci’s identity and re-establish his place in trap’s mixtape hierarchy with a measured dose of what he built his trap house on: a wild mixture of slurry phonetic gaffes, lumbering wordplay, and sly wit over production from the subgenre’s marquee names.</p>
<p>When Gucci Mane is at his muddled best, his words mash together and his phrases bury ledes in favor of ancillary details so colorful they pique one’s interest. He doesn’t reach Peak Gucci on <i>King Gucci</i>, but there are flashes of it everywhere (""Cash smell like cocaina/ Got Febreze for all my cheese"" on ""Still Selling Dope""; the combo of ""My pops wasn’t ‘round but least he gave me good looks"" and ""Tattoos on my face card ‘cause I don’t want no job"" on ""I’m Too Much""). You still have to parse through his sometimes clumsy phrasing and garbled speech, but the flows are trickier here and the wordplay niftier than on a lot of his other recent releases. The woozy Tarentino production on the title track allows Gucci enough space to stretch and mash vowel sounds like putty. On ""Real Dope Boy"" he again implies a return to form: ""I’m back making old school trap boy music."" The tape’s highlight is the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a>-produced ""Smart Mouth"", which pairs the GBE rapper/producer’s abstract synth work with some of Gucci’s more technical rapping.</p>
<p>One underrated truth about Gucci is that he is an even better A&amp;R than he is an artist, and while Gucci the Great Rapper can go dormant without warning, Gucci the A&amp;R is one of the only constants in Atlanta’s ever-changing, burgeoning underground. <i>King Gucci</i>’s strongest argument for his staying power, maybe unknowingly, are the names lining its credits: those he helped nurture or nudge or promote throughout his illustrious run. DJs Scream and Drama, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32494-peewee-longway/"">PeeWee Longway</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>, Zaytoven, Metro Boomin, Tarentino, and TM88 have all built respectable careers with Gucci’s help and their presence here feels like another boast. <i>King Gucci</i> is a valiant but limited attempt to re-establish Gucci Mane’s foothold on trap from behind bars with old tropes and familiar faces.</p></div>"|20633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20633-king-gucci/|6.4|Sheldon Pearce

Their debut, <i>Consumer Complaints</i>, was one of the best punk records of 2013 when it was released by the group's DIY label <a href=""http://milkrecords.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mïlk Records</a> in November of that year. (Here it sees a U.S. release courtesy of larger longtime UK indie label <a href=""http://www.fat-cat.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fat Cat Records</a>.)</p>
<p>All three members previously played together in the underrated group Covergirl, and all three sing here, though guitarist Rachel Aggs (also of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28912-trash-kit/"">Trash Kit</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30916-golden-grrrls/"">Golden Grrrls</a>, and scores of other bands) takes lead on most of Shopping’s songs. Overlapping and circling vocal patterns are played to excellent effect, so that the vocals seem less like something that sit on top of the music, and more part of an integrated whole.</p>
<p>Aggs’ trademark guitar style leans on broken and manipulated '60s-style garage riffs—in style and tone, in this band and others, her guitar work is often reminiscent of a less straightforward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1753-holly-golightly/"">Holly Golightly</a>/<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thee_Headcoatees"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Headcoatees</a>. This is one of the elements that keeps <i>Consumer Complaints</i>’<i> </i>songs from blurring into one another, though they rarely vary in tempo. All of the songs also have their own structures: there's no verse-chorus-verse or predictable bridge insertion; instead, songs are structured to breathe, blurring into noise where necessary (""Santa Monica Place"") or stretching out melodic themes to disco ends (""Get Going""). As a result, no track seems too short or too long; one gets the sense that the songs have been structured only to start where they need to and then were allowed to grow organically into their recorded forms through repeated practice and performance.</p>
<p>The politics on <i>Consumer Complaints </i>are refreshingly more embodied than didactic, mixing blunt statements about the alienation and immediacy necessary to queer desires under capitalism without preaching or feeling heavy-handed. Drummer Andrew Milk has said that Shopping <a href=""%20http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-music-itself-is-a-form-of-protest"">""never discussed having a particular political message at all as a band.""</a> This may be yet another reason why <i>Consumer Complaints</i> bubbles with joy without being explicitly joyful and why this collection of songs never feels artificial or forced.</p>
<p>There is no cool plastic sheen meant to signify the post-industrial age over this record, and Shopping’s music doesn’t feel consistently grinding or harsh, though they don’t shy away from dissonance or from breaking melodic motifs. These are warm, human songs, songs that celebrate real power in making the music you want to with your friends on your own terms, songs that celebrate the multifaceted natures of people struggling to make themselves heard via relatively antiquated technology in a sped-up world where human interaction is often mediated through digital simulacra.</p></div>"|20572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20572-consumer-complaints/|7.3|Jes Skolnik

The project released two full-lengths on venerable zone-out institution, <a href=""http://www.kranky.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kranky</a>, and also an EP on <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mexican Summer</a> before disappearing from view in the late 2000s.</p>
<p>Since 2010, Owens and her partner, Rafael Fauria, have focused on creating hardware-driven psychedelic house music under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29673-miracles-club/"">Miracles Club</a>, releasing a number of EPs on labels like <a href=""http://theecstasyblog.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ecstasy</a> and Mexican Summer. However, following the birth of their first child in 2013, the pair felt compelled to temporarily <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2015/05/17/valet-kranky-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">step away from club sounds</a>. Rather than release the resulting mellower guitar-driven music as Miracles Club, Owens decided to resurrect Valet, only this time as a group, featuring Fauria and multi-instrumentalist Mark Burden. The result is <i>Nature</i>, Valet’s first record in seven years.</p>
<p>A lot has changed. Previous Valet albums were song-driven, but much more abstract in their execution. The music was centered on Owens’ voice, but also readily wandered into extended space-outs—abstract doodles, warped guitar leads, and repetitive psychedelic loops. The music was gentle, but the improvisational disorder conveyed a certain amount of menace and discomfort.</p>
<p><i>Nature </i>is more focused and more serene. Both the melodic content and production style suggest that Owens and Fauria have been revisiting '90s psych and space-rock staples like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4475-the-verve/"">the Verve</a> (<i>A </i><i>Storm in Heaven</i>-era Verve, at least). Those bands relied heavily on studio time and technology to generate a distinctively gauzy vibe—leaning heavily on reverb, delay, and lots of guitar overdubs. On <i>Nature, </i>Valet turns to similar sounds, but on a stricter budget. Much like Kranky-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"">Deerhunter</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5633-atlas-sound/"">Atlas Sound</a> (Owens was a touring member of that band), the group uses readily available resources—foot pedals, computer-based recording software, digital plug-ins—to dial in otherworldly ambience. It sounds DIY, but in a way that strengthens the record’s character and allows some distance from its influences. </p>
<p>What really separates this most recent incarnation of Valet from the shoegaze records of yesteryear, though, is the songwriting. Old-school space rock bands were very concerned with transcending or escaping one’s physical self—revisit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3574-ride/"">Ride</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcyfPXF770U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Leave Them All Behind""</a>, the Verve’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X45hWP_QKt0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slide Away""</a>, or just about any Spiritualized song. On <i>Nature</i>, Owens’ lyrics tend to involve memory and personal upheaval, rather than altered states. ""Twelve different ways to put up a fight/ Upside down police cars under fire bridges,"" she sings on the record’s title track, which alternately recalls experiences with civil unrest, 40s, and LSD. For such a trippy, reverb-drenched, and ethereal set of songs, <i>Nature </i>is surprisingly intimate and reflective.</p>
<p><i>Nature </i>does deliver the psych-rock goods, though. The trio’s songs impart a feeling of ascension—with murky atmosphere giving way to nodding repetition and guitar-driven uplift. Like their peers and forebears, Valet create simple music that feels expansive. Only here, the swirl of fuzz and echo isn't an exit from terrestrial woes, just a comfortable place to take stock for a moment.</p></div>"|20614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20614-nature/|7.1|Aaron Leitko

The 17 songs on <i>Qliphoth</i>, the audacious third LP from the nominally grindcore group, portray characters often trampled under society’s heaviest feet—inner-city outcasts and sexual deviants, drug addicts and civil servants, the emotionally disturbed and the physically wounded. Cops abuse inmates. Bosses victimize employees. Humans exploit animals. Each group treats the next as if they were somehow doing something less than living. But with her pointed poetry vivified and fortified by the band around her, Marshall, one of metal’s best new bandleaders, unapologetically offers those characters a megaphone. <i>Qliphoth</i> feels like a series of prepared rebellions, then, simply waiting to start.</p>
<p>It’s always been easiest to talk about Cloud Rat as a grindcore band. Their <a href=""https://cloudrat.bandcamp.com/album/cloud-rat-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled 2010 LP</a> ripped through 11 numbers in just less than 18 minutes, while 2013’s <a href=""https://cloudrat.bandcamp.com/album/moksha-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Moksha </i></a>crammed its first 12 songs into about 22 minutes. But the latter’s closing title track made it clear there was more to Cloud Rat than sprinting and stammering. Throbbing bass and groaning guitar drifted around an eerie piano theme, Marshall’s wordless vocals webbing around the instruments like the ghosts of her wrath. Coupled with the album’s occasional nods to D-beat, black metal, and even classic, riff-driven rock'n'roll, the Godspeed-shaped instrumental suggested a wider trajectory for Cloud Rat than that of mere <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ass%C3%BCck"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Assück</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutal_Truth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brutal Truth</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31559-carcass/"">Carcass</a> disciples. (Their <a href=""https://cloudrat.bandcamp.com/track/the-needle-and-the-damage-done"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of ""The Needle and the Damage Done"", one DJ Lethal turntable solo away from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-EdCNjumvI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Limp Bizkit’s ""Faith""</a>, would have dispatched any lingering doubt.) On <i>Qliphoth</i>, they doggedly power around those predecessors once and for all.</p>
<p>Aside from their respective finales, neither of Cloud Rat’s previous albums included a track that broke the three-minute mark. But a quarter of <i>Qliphoth</i>’s songs do, evidence of the band’s decision and ability to do more here than plow ahead with vitriol, velocity, and volume. ""Udder Distance"", for instance, climbs from an arching riff and a low tempo to a tremolo-and-blast-beat bristle, touching on death metal and post-punk along the way. ""Raccoon"" unfurls as steadily escalating doom, the drums pulling backward even as Marshall’s voice arrows ahead. Previously a trio, Cloud Rat expanded into a quartet for <i>Qliphoth</i>, adding Brandon Hill and his abrasive electronics to the guitar, drums, and screams. His impact is immediate, as album opener ""Seken"" begins with a static roar, a droning guitar, and Marshall’s momentarily seraphic vocals, refracted as if by a prism. On ""Thin Vein"", the first half of a two-part suite, Hill emboldens the band’s slow rise from a post-rock drift into a powerful, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"">Neurosis</a>-sized coda.</p>
<p>All of these influences wind around a grindcore framework, now five years in the making for Cloud Rat. They are cold and efficient when it comes to the basics, as on the 96-second tirade ""Live Wake"" or the prurient, punctuation-free ""Bloated Goat"". Marshall is thrilling and telling on these brow beaters, as she’s able to control her voice without mitigating its barbaric effect. With the band racing behind during ""Botched"", she manages to deliver commands like ""Get on your feet, you fucking dog"" with elocution and impact. You can actually <i>hear </i>what she’s talking about—and feel it, too.</p>
<p>Even within metal, grindcore is often regarded as a relatively impenetrable niche, where lots of words and riffs come crammed in very little spaces. Sometimes, the pugnacious effect of it all gets more attention than the particulars. But on <i>Qliphoth</i>, Cloud Rat take the time and risks necessary to make sure their points are clear, that all their rage is not for naught. ""The end goal is really just for cathartic therapy, as it’s hard to express yourself in public,"" <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/cloud-rat-interview-stream"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marshall told Kim Kelly </a>in an interview earlier this month. ""You can’t beat up your boss, you can’t stop the clock, etc. So we need this outlet to survive at this point."" To that end, <i>Qliphoth</i> invokes both folk and punk rock, idioms where form and function commingle rather than compete. Cloud Rat’s misgivings with the world both power and mutate the music they make, rendering a rebellious vision of liberation and existence. During ""Rusting Belt"", the band loops a sample of Brenna Sanchez, the co-director of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1781784/?ref_=nm_flmg_prd_3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a documentary</a> about <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/13/us-usa-detroit-arson-idUSBRE96C06E20130713"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Detroit’s recent seizure by fire. </a>""Arson is a form of self-expression in a place where you can’t express yourself,"" she says.<i> </i>On <i>Qliphoth</i>, Cloud Rat extend tempestuous expressions for troubled times—proof of life, offered with utter conviction.</p></div>"|20611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20611-qliphoth/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

For decades, late-arriving fans were told she died of AIDS, penniless and displaced, curled up on a New York City street corner. That particular bit of apocrypha has since been debunked (she was in the care of her friend, the guitarist Peter Walker, when she passed away in 1993), but it pervades her memory anyhow: Karen Dalton, lost soul. The saddest, sorriest voice of the '60s. </p>
<p>Dalton only recorded two LPs in her lifetime, 1969’s <i>Its So Hard to Tell Who’s Going to Love You the Best</i> and 1971’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9623-in-my-own-time/""><i>In My Own Time</i></a>, both of which have since been reissued and lionized as lost folk classics—held up, decades later, as examples of how, sometimes, the culture falters, fails, picks the wrong heroes. Dalton wasn’t known as a songwriter—neither record contains a single original composition—but Walker, who oversees her estate, emerged recently with a stack of song lyrics (verses, snippets, poems) that she never got around to recording, or, maybe, never intended to.</p>
<p>Dalton’s words were distributed to a handful of contemporary singers, and <i>Remembering Mountains: Unheard Songs by Karen Dalton</i> sees them put to new music, much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/449-billy-bragg/"">Billy Bragg</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> did with a pile of unrecorded Woody Guthrie lyrics on 1998’s <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> and again on its companion piece, 2000’s <i>Mermaid Avenue, Vol. II</i>.</p>
<p>Bob Dylan said Dalton had a voice like Billie Holiday’s (lots of people thought so), but Holiday sublimated her suffering—there are the tiniest suggestions of it in her control, in the way she judiciously deployed vibrato, the way she pulled back, raised her chin—whereas Dalton let it bubble up, get ugly. There’s a comparable shrillness to vocals from Kurt Cobain, Axl Rose, all the great American sufferers; it’s there when Skip James sings, viciously, ""I'm so tired, and I am tired; I am tired."" It’s there when Dalton sings ""You haven't got a thing to say, you feel you want to run away,"" in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsYHN7eCCtU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Something’s on Your Mind""</a>, and it reaches an apotheosis in that song’s devastating coda: ""Well, you know, you can’t make it without ever even trying."" That quality is what allowed her to take other people’s material and make it feel personal—in her voice, everything seems singular, a site-specific wound. The best tracks on <i>Remembering Mountains</i> do the same. </p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a> opens the record with the title track, the only song for which Dalton receives a non-lyrical credit (""words and chords by Karen Dalton""). Van Etten, joined by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen/"">the Walkmen</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7485-hamilton-leithauser/"">Hamilton Leithauser</a>, has a particular knack for writing big, sweeping laments—the kinds of aching melodies that make your breath catch—and she manages to match or at least meet the deep melancholy that haunts so much of Dalton’s output. Van Etten sings here, as Dalton often did, of wanting her lover to be better, stronger: ""I’m believing/ You’ll find tomorrow.""</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>’s take on ""So Long Ago and Far Away"" is brutal in its ghostliness, like a memory you can’t quite access, a memory that registers only as a loss. ""Friends and lovers all become/ So long ago and far away,"" Nadler intones, her voice breathy, bare.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, songwriters build structures around Dalton’s words that feel more anachronistic (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/972-diane-cluck/"">Diane Cluck</a>’s beguiling ""This Is Our Love"" could be the lone ballad on any number of million-selling pop records), but few find anything particularly joyful in her lyrics; folks hungry for an alternate narrative about Dalton—something sweeter, more balanced—will have to look elsewhere. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4600-lucinda-williams/"">Lucinda Williams</a> comes closest to at least finding some toughness in Dalton’s found language: ""He asked me if I needed help/ I told him to go help himself,"" she sings on ""Met an Old Friend"". A few peals of blues guitar act as a kind of confirmation—the look you give after you tell someone to back off.</p>
<p><i>Remembering Mountains</i> is maybe the closest we’ll ever get to hearing Dalton’s own articulations of heartache, although plenty was communicated on her first two records, regardless of whether the words there were her own. Still, there’s a palpable narrative here, a sense of loss and stillness, and it reanimates Dalton, if only for a moment. It’s good to have her back.</p></div>"|20515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20515-remembering-mountains-unheard-songs-by-karen-dalton/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

It’s a common affliction in recording studios, where one minute you can be doing something relatively mundane like figuring out the right placement for a hi-hat in the mix and the next thing you know you’re hours deep into microscopically tweaking an array of equalizers and compressors, feverishly searching for some sort of tonal nirvana.</p>
<p>Usually this is a sign of studio madness, but some musicians and producers have made it a viable way of working. On <i>What You Hear (Is What You Hear)</i>, German minimalist techno producer Thomas Brinkmann has gone deliriously over that particular edge.</p>
<p>Minimal techno, a genre that revolves around compulsive sonic fastidiousness, is a breeding ground for tonal obsession—the picky ears of its makers and audience have played a major role in keeping pure analog synthesis alive and evolving during the periods when it wasn’t in style. Even within this context, Brinkmann stands out as an especially exacting engineer, and his recordings offer a sense of painstaking sumptuousness that stand apart from the rest of the minimal techno crowd.</p>
<p><i>What You Hear (Is What You Hear)</i> is minimalist, but it’s not techno. Each track consists of a single tone held for anywhere between two and 11 minutes, with minimal modulation and no significant changes in dynamics or pitch. Rhythm is only occasionally a factor, and only emerges as a byproduct of the sustained sound’s internal pulses, never as a separate track. Ambient’s not the right word for it either, because the songs are too alien-sounding to settle into the scenery.</p>
<p>The static quality of the compositions don’t make for what’s traditionally considered an exciting listen, but anyone who enjoys dissecting what comes into their ears will find a lot of pleasure in <i>What You Hear</i>. It rewards listeners who take an active role in the listening, those willing to dig deeper, analyzing the elements in the sounds one at a time and teasing apart their structures.</p>
<p>But the record’s not just for obsessive audio freaks. If you engage with the songs on their own terms they’re fascinatingly evocative. ""Ziegelrot"" (which means ""brick-red"") is a recursive, juddering howl that sounds like the first feedback-saturated seconds of a cheaply recorded hardcore song extended to the length of an entire 7"" side. ""Mitisgrün"" begins as something like the comforting white-noise pulse of a distant air conditioner unit and ramps up to a throbbing grind so slowly and subtly you’re likely to miss the point where it tips over from soothing to anxiety-inducing.</p>
<p>Brinkmann’s experiment in pure tonality is the inverse of the works where he’s effectively removed it from his compositions entirely, producing music that’s pure rhythm. In the <a href=""https://youtu.be/eNEEjbBbdqo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">incredible video of a performance at Tokyo’s Taico Club</a>, he skillfully etches lines in blank vinyl on eight turntables and constructs a fully rave-able techno song out of the staticky pops the gashes produce. The only apparent direction he has left is to make a record that doesn’t have any musical elements at all. It’ll probably sound great.</p></div>"|20553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20553-what-you-hear-is-what-you-hear/|6.9|Miles Raymer

Not in the conceptual sense of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14516-the-suburbs""><i>The Suburb</i></a>. Rather, Two Sheds’ sophomore LP is suburban in how it prefers to maintain a distance from the bustle, turnover, and excitement that's so close in a city. When I listen to the Los Angeles quintet, I’m reminded of how quickly their home city can look like Anytown, USA if you drive 30 minutes in any direction—neat little plots, calm, manicured lawns, with the palm trees and sunshine making it look just a little more Californian.</p>
<p>Appropriately enough, the CVs of everyone involved are heavy on supporting roles and side projects. After Two Sheds quietly released their debut <a href=""http://twosheds.bandcamp.com/album/strange-ammunition"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Strange Ammunition</i></a> in 2006, singer Caitlin Gutenberger moonlit in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3643-rogue-wave"">Rogue Wave</a> offshoot <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29800-release-the-sunbird/"">Release the Sunbird</a>. There, she met new Two Sheds drummer Josh Barnhart, who had once manned the skins for Rogue Wave-ish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5440-port-obrien"">Port O’Brien</a>. Barnhart replaced Rusty Miller, a collaborator of Cali power-pop mainstay <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3953-kelley-stoltz/"">Kelley Stoltz</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1773-grandaddy"">Grandaddy</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6067-jason-lytle"">Jason Lytle</a>. The credits of engineer Eli Thomson include Everest and Delta Spirit, both of which are the kind of secretly very popular alt-roots bands you never read about in major publications. And it’s mastered by TW Walsh, a guy name-dropped as David Bazan’s trusted van driver in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3273-pedro-the-lion"">Pedro the Lion</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzRGgJktMLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bands With Managers""</a>. Bassist Johnny Gutenberger is the outlier, having played for late-'90s alt-rock almosts Far, a band best known these days for giving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1657-lupe-fiasco"">Lupe Fiasco</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsZUSP1p20s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a hookman</a> or being a major influence on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1051-deftones"">Deftones</a>. </p>
<p>But while Two Sheds can sound like just about every band they’ve ever been affiliated with, that overstates their range. None of Far’s quasi-emo alt-metal seeps into <i>Assembling</i>, but it would’ve been a welcome jolt on a record that seems to revel in its lack of urgency. Gutenberger's lyrics tend to express passing concern about things not really worth getting worked up about. ""It’s Okay"" shares a common heartsickness with Rogue Wave’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8wulSNIo6A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chicago x12""</a>, of trying to stay enthusiastic while playing to empty rooms. But it’s nowhere close to touching the latter’s devastation and demoralization, the implication being that if no one comes out to see Two Sheds, at least they’ve got each other.</p>
<p>Gutenberger's voice is suited for lower stakes, appealing and capable of blending in and reminiscing about the instability or novelty of her '90s influences rather than embodying them. ""Choose"" and ""Nighttime"" are earnest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star"">Mazzy Star</a> homage, ""It’s Okay"" is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case"">Neko Case</a> after being hit with a noise ordinance, the hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a> are from her <i>Whitechocolatespaceegg</i> phase. And those are the edgier parts of <i>Assembling</i>. The core is the kind of clap-happy folk-pop that picks up right where <i>Strange Ammunition</i> left off, which is Los Angeles in 2006. On any given night at the erstwhile Spaceland back then, you might see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27837-elvis-perkins"">Elvis Perkins</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4905-the-little-ones"">the Little Ones</a> or the Parson Redheads or any number of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4827-midlake"">Midlake</a>-esque acts and be told in all seriousness that this was everything exciting about indie rock.</p>
<p>I found out after the fact that <i>Assembling</i> was the result of a dare where Gutenberger was challenged to write 20 songs per day, and she did so for three days. Accounting for sleep, bathroom breaks, checking Twitter, and milling about the house, that rounds out to a new song every 45 minutes or so. In their words, the 14 resultant songs (and a pitch-shifted conversation about a drum set tagged as the closer) were considered ""solid"" enough to be included here. They are indeed sturdy and uniform in structure, with choruses arriving with the pleasant regularity of the mailman or street sweepers. The breeziness ensures that everything passes by like neighborly small talk, getting on before anything gets too invested or deep. Ultimately, it’s suburban in that there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s certainly a nice place to not have to worry about much. But if you’re feeling even slightly weird or craving adventure, <i>Assembling</i> can remind you just how suffocating Anytown, USA can be. </p></div>"|20610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20610-assembling/|5.5|Ian Cohen

While his versatility keeps him afloat, it’s tough to get a bead on exactly who Murs is and what he stands for—is he the conscious backpacker or the straight-talking street dude? He embodies the urban alternative, kids who crave artsy shit and push skateboards to the corner store, but after 18 years and many projects, there’s no single album that offers his<i> </i>full narrative. <i>Have a Nice Life</i> is perhaps the closest thing to such a release; many of these anecdotes pertain to Murs and offer insight into his California upbringing, finding the rapper at his most reflective. He’s assessing his current stature and how he arrived at this moment.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to get the point. He’s got cute kids and a faithful wife. There’s food in the fridge and money in his bank account. Following a slew of record deals—including stops at Warner Bros. and Definitive Jux—Murs seems content at rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32889-tech-n9ne/"">Tech N9ne</a>’s <a href=""https://www.strangemusicinc.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strange Music</a> label (a notion shouted out a few times on <i>Nice Life</i>). Oh, and in case you didn’t know, Murs gave certain West Coast rappers their first shot to shine. ""I could drop names, I could be that asshole,"" the rapper fumes on ""Surprises"". ""After all that, you’d think they’d be thankful/ But hoes ain’t loyal and niggas ain’t grateful.""</p>
<p>Once the brash young reformist, Murs approaches <i>Nice Life</i> with gray-haired wisdom. He’s not trying to prove anything, instead sounding comfortable simply talking to his children and addressing societal issues. ""No More Control"" feels especially relevant amid the recent killings of unarmed black men by police. Yeah, he says, it’s fucked up what the cops are doing, but ""we got to start to take a look in the mirror … if we don’t respect ourselves, then they always gon’ fear us.""</p>
<p><i>Have a Nice Life </i>is as much about Los Angeles as it is about Murs. Between its autobiographical bent and rap-rock instrumentals, the album declares the rapper’s survival while paying homage to friends who didn’t make it. That’s why, at age 37, he’s embracing the signs of advancing age by hood standards. ""I don’t wanna dye my hair,"" Murs asserts on the opening track, ""‘cause a lot of my homies died before they got there."" Just how they passed is anyone’s guess, but listening to <i>Have a Nice Life</i>, it could be from a number of things: Maybe it was from the same stress outlined on ""PTSD"" (""niggas kill niggas just to fuck a bitch"") or ""Woke Up Dead"", which outlines the dangers of L.A. gang life. If those songs peek into Murs’ personal angst, it bubbles over on ""I Miss Mikey"", the album’s closing track and probable mission statement: ""One day I’mma lose and then I’ll be gone, I’m making these songs so that I live on.""</p>
<p>As a whole,<i> Have a Nice Life </i>stands as a decent collection of songs that, while palatable, casually floats by in a sea of average beats by Jesse Shatkin, who produced much of the album. The composer specializes in hulking, pop-infused tracks, which don't quite mesh with the rapper's cohesive tales. At times, some of the stories grow stale without strong lyricism. We learn more about Murs, but he's still searching for that complete statement.</p></div>"|20622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20622-have-a-nice-life/|6.3|Marcus J.

She picks out a quiet acoustic theme shaped roughly like a question mark, then dots it with a bass note that thrums loosely, a rattle that cuts the air and dispels the notion that <i>Oh Man, Cover the Ground </i>will be the kind of tasteful folk record that plays quietly in the background. There’s an entire guitar solo in that one moment, revealing Cleveland to be a deft player and a witty composer. She accentuates certain details with a percussive strike or a sudden strum, and that technique destabilizes ""Butter &amp; Eggs"", which changes shape and direction on her whim rather than by any sense of melodic momentum.</p>
<p>She’s been honing her chops as a solo artist for a few years now, although most readers may recognize her as one-fourth of the Seattle garage-pop outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31079-la-luz/"">La Luz</a>. The Sandcastles have been around maybe even longer in some form or another, its membership consisting of whoever happens to be onstage or in the studio with Cleveland at any given moment. For <i>Oh Man, Cover the Ground</i>, the band includes nine rotating musicians who add a flourish of clarinet, cello, and Wurlitzer to these songs. The music on ""Itching Around"" and ""SPATM"" is somehow both lush and austere, as the Sandcastles gently push against Cleveland’s guitar and her sunset of a voice. Even the keyboard solo on ""City to City"" sounds like it doesn’t want to get in her way.</p>
<p>Cleveland is a guitarist first and foremost, a vocalist second, and a songwriter third. Her lyrics tend toward a kind of brisk poetry, stark and ominous and generally reluctant to dwell on any one moment or sensation. In just 63 words, ""City to City"" evokes an immense feeling of transience that any touring musician will recognize (""I began to wonder what our house was for""). Most of these songs, however, are about the simple pleasures of another body. ""Sweet Percy Perdue, my nights belong to you,"" she sings on ""Rounding the Block"". ""The peaks and valleys too, all the creatures that you drew."" It’s not what she's singing but the way she’s singing it: her voice straining slightly toward notes just outside her range, drawing out the phrases languidly, savoring the smoothness of those vowels like stones she found on the beach.</p>
<p>This is, however, not a singer-songwriter’s album, but a guitar album—as befits a woman who <a href=""http://www.tompkinssquare.com/obscure-cards.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">illustrated a full set of folk trading cards</a>. Cleveland may be routinely compared to other female singer-songwriters, but she may ultimately have more in common with the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30783-daniel-bachman/"">Daniel Bachman</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/629-james-blackshaw/"">James Blackshaw</a>—that boy’s club of American Primitivists. The rolling reel that opens <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17477-shana-cleveland-the-sandcastles-holy-rollers/"">""Holy Rollers""</a> and the almost Celtic fretwork of ""Quiet as Skin"" suggest an artist who is knowledgeable of the past but not beholden to it. She’s not an ostentatious player, although she certainly has the chops; she seldom solos and usually avoids the fussy filigrees that demonstrate technique as much as they serve the song. There is power in her brand of understatement, in letting a song almost fall apart just to show how sturdy it is.</p></div>"|20612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20612-oh-man-cover-the-ground/|7.3|Stephen M.

Blink and you’ll miss the guitar in the beginning of <i>Multi-Love’</i>s ""The World Is Crowded"" because a burst of synths comes in and saturate the track to a pure white hum. If you don’t catch the anxieties and heartbreaks of polyamorous love, it’s because Ruban Nielson has compressed and phased his voice down to a thin analog texture. Falling for UMO is as easy as taking time to look for what Nielson conceals in his songs. It can be a vintage Crumar synth tangled in the mix, or him pondering if someone would listen to his ""silly voice"" on the last day of their life; a loose hi-hat on the off-beat subtly driving the verse into the chorus, or him thinking his wife’s love for him is her ""fatal flaw.""</p>
<p>For as tuned-in and specific as it is, <i>Multi-Love</i> is multivalent. Next to some baroque '60s beat music there’s a Zappa homage, propped up against a dance track you could find on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a> record, followed by some pigeon-toed funk that you should probably do a bunch of drugs to. It’s a wunderkammer inside, cramped with hundreds of tiny gestures, musical and lyrical. Recall, this is a guy who’s obsessed with taking huge pop ideas, like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DwfeiXSstc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Can You Luv Me""</a> off his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15539-unknown-mortal-orchestra/"">debut album</a>, and turning them completely inward. That song could be a Bruno Mars No. 1 hit in the hands of a major label producer. But Nielson is a fussy gear-head who loves psychedelia, shredding on his guitar without a pick, and, well, making music to do a bunch of drugs to. All the pop songs are buried deep in the mossy soul of <i>Multi-Love</i>.</p>
<p>Nielson produced, mixed, and engineered the entirety of <i>Multi-Love. </i>Some back-end teams work hard to hide in the shadows and feel that if they do their job well, the listener won’t even notice any production. Nielson is the opposite of that. The production is so central it’s almost another character on the album, corroding and tripping out the instruments, and compressing drum tracks down so they can fit in the palm of your hand. At times it feels like you’re listening to the album with un-popped ears. Once in a while, on simpler songs like the mid-tempo ""Stage or Screen"" or the obtuse motown-soul of ""Ur Life One Night"", make this vintage sheen feel like a crutch rather than a purposeful tool.</p>
<p>Nielson's ear for <i>how</i> something should sound is unparalleled, and his fastidious choices behind the boards are a large part of what makes <i>Multi-Love</i> a joy to listen to. It's as if he tried to make Stevie Wonder’s <i>Innervisions </i>and Prince’s <i>Sign ‘O’ the Times </i>in secret, so as not to wake the kids upstairs—private celebrations and private exorcisms. The most outspoken Nielson gets is on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17447-unknown-mortal-orchestra-cant-keep-checking-my-phone/"">""Can’t Keep Checking My Phone""</a>, a single worthy of Larry Levan’s crate at Paradise Garage as some one-off flamenco disco track stuck near the end of the set. Underneath the spacey dance party, Nielson lays out a bittersweet song about missing someone you love, while the other person you love is right by your side.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/profiles/9646-love-is-strange-the-multitudes-of-unknown-mortal-orchestras-ruban-nielson/"">profile</a>, Nielson said, ""Think about the two most serious relationships in your life so far, and then experiencing them simultaneously."" Polyamory is an emotionally and spiritually dense topic to approach on an album, and, for someone with a third-eye tattoo, Nielson mostly avoids speaking in hempy clichés. Save for some grand overtures on the title track that actually feel more expository than anything else, his laments about these two women in his life are as finely portioned as the music below it. He ropes his feelings under universal themes on ""Extreme Wealth and Casual Cruelty"". Who wouldn't want to abandon it all and start over again as ""just strangers"" without the strictures of money or society? It's a story as old as time, only in Nielson's case, it just happens to be star-triple-cross'd lovers. </p>
<p>This is Nielson's most accomplished album, though it's not his most direct, or brash, or explosive. Those are moods he mostly saves that for the closer, ""Puzzles"". The seven-minute song serves as a tacked-on coda with overdriven '70s hard rock guitar and Nielson stretching the capacity of his vocals to a bluesy peak. It will kill live, as will most of these songs which will bend into longer, louder psych forms in rock clubs. But ""Puzzles"" feels broad and out of place here, despite its charms. Maybe it's the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrL9uMqeP8M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Electioneering""</a> outlier of an album with such an evocative mood. I think there's more to be found in the horn part on the endlessly melodic ""Necessary Evil"", played by Nielson's father. It's soft as Muzak, a simple up-and-down melody with smooth swing rhythm. When Nielson coos the words ""necessary evil,"" the horn line just shifts forward one beat in the measure, making it sound entirely different while actually staying the exact same. It's one small link in a long chain of moments strung together seamlessly and imbued with so much.</p></div>"|20590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20590-unknown-mortal-orchestra-multi-love/|7.1|Jeremy D.

Soon, we realize the scene is a dream within a dream: The garden party is a shared hallucination by the soldiers, sitting catatonic in a medical theater in China, where they have been made guinea pigs for a Communist brainwashing program. The soldiers’ false tea party and the sordid conference become intertwined—the Communists show up in New Jersey, and the hydrangea-obsessed matron stands at the podium in Manchuria. The film loses itself in the enslaved squadron’s nightmare. Presiding over the pitch-black comedy is the mysterious Chinese doctor and hypnotist Yen Lo, who ultimately brings the garden party to a close by ordering the Sergeant, Raymond Shaw (played by Laurence Harvey), to kill two of his own comrades.</p>
<p>The scene introduces the brutal, hopelessly entangled systems of control and indoctrination that dominate <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, the elements of the story that interest Brooklyn rapper and producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30330-ka/"">Ka</a> and producer <a href=""http://www.mondieumusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Preservation</a> on their new album, <i>Days With Dr. Yen Lo</i>. The album does not in any way retrace the plot of the film or the book that inspired it (a page, half-obscured, is the cover of the album), but instead engages with its themes, playing off of soundbytes interspersed between songs. The album and the twist-filled <i>noir </i>share a paranoiac atmosphere: Tension is everywhere and nowhere in particular. Nothing turns out right; no one breaks the shackles that held them without a scar or much worse. ""Yen Lo,"" in both, is the unrepentant arbiter of fate, both the cold facts and entropy of life, concentrated into one force.</p>
<p>The primary conflict in Ka’s verses is the same as that of Shaw’s and Marco’s: attempting to self-actualize, after realizing you’ve been under the thrall of a deception that has contorted your entire sense of reality for so long. In most of these songs, the lies Ka unravels relate to crime: the insidious desire to commit it, and the systemic filing-down of one’s moral fabric that allows one to do so. In just a few lines, Ka can evoke simultaneously the fear, desperation, and poisonous ennui of his particular troubled upbringing, though he speaks for more than himself: ""Crime is how mind rewarded doubt/ Time’s a drought, climb that waterspout/ Itsy bitsy, slung to get crispy/ Almost choked in the web spun to fix me."" Ka positions music itself as part of the process of reclaiming himself, and rapping as a way to access thoughts and emotions that might otherwise seem out of reach to him, or those who can relate to his stories.</p>
<p>To communicate all this most transparently, Ka lets his words phrase themselves, recalling NYC-area forbearers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14362-guru/"">Guru</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3519-rakim/"">Rakim</a>. The dizzying inner consonances in his lines jump out of their own accord, as if Ka, with his hushed, unwavering monotone, is simply a vessel for them to move through; all of the action and consternation has already occurred on the notepad. His great skill is his almost inconceivable level of control and precision. Just the honeyed sounds of his words are hypnotizing in themselves; his expertly matched vowel sounds melt into one uninterrupted stream in some phrases, registering almost like one low whistle. His pace is continuous, sometimes dizzying. Processing both form and content at once requires a specific type of meditative listening: the kind that can only happen once one has lost track of themselves in the sound, and let distractions and interference gradually fall away, rather than pushing them off. Trying too hard to latch onto anything here means automatically falling behind.</p>
<p>But reaching this type of deep-listening nirvana is not a necessity; this is music that sounds great any way you come at it. Preservation’s production is a psychedelic, sometimes seasick symphony of fragments from LPs, often cut out in large swatches and dovetailed into one another expertly. At times, a shag-carpet studio orchestra sweeps toward climaxes without really reaching them; more often, a simple, plaintive guitar lick drones, or a warbling organ peals unexpectedly, recalling either a gospel coda or a spy thriller soundtrack. There are also some of the small, locked-groove loops Ka gravitated towards on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16447-ka-grief-pedigree/"">previous</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18341-ka-the-nights-gambit/"">two</a> LPs—more pulsations than kernels of melody or licks, flickering like candles on the verge of burning out.</p>
<p>One of the most notable aspects of the album is its near-complete lack of percussion. Few of these songs include kick and snare drums, and none are anchored by them. His voice—in the middle of the mix, bolstered by eerie, repitched overdubs—is the only consistent rhythm instrument. Ka has phased out elements of the typical East Coast-indigenous rap beat architecture over his past several releases (most dramatically on the ascetic <i>The Night’s Gambit</i>, with its charcoal-shaded minimalism) and here, we’ve reached a new type of freefall.</p>
<p>Ka’s sound is so specific that it is easy to hear a new release, register it as more of the same, and coast through it. But you’d miss the most stunning element of his work: the way in which the rapper seems to cut a little bit more of something away with each new project, something which unnecessarily complicates his ideal mode of direct and razor-sharp communication. Here, he allows more negative space in, creates pictures more economically, peels away some vestigial density. The old releases hold the same power, but every time you grab a new Ka release, it feels as if you are holding a more refined product.</p></div>"|20561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20561-days-with-dr-yen-lo/|8.0|Winston Cook-Wilson

They were, it seemed, covering the spread</span><span>, and on debut LP </span><i>UFO Rot</i><span>, the band flaunts and doubles down on this indecisiveness until it begins to resemble a hard-fought virtue.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""New Flesh"" leads the album off in slash-and-burn fashion, a squealing fit of gnarled guitar distortion and primal drum pound that cuts out almost as soon as it’s begun. Astringent, one-chord thrash dominates the title track until—after a pregnant, feedback drenched pause—the song crashes through to a vista that’s more intensely chromatic and muscular. Enough gaps stud the blurred hardcore of ""Heehaw Collider"" that Tropical Trash have got to be baiting the slam-dancers in their audience. ""Leisure Exposure"" broadens the canvas to a more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a>-an notion of punk that contains heaving multitudes: snaggle-toothed slacker-rock solos, scales flambeed though furious ascents and descents, cymbal-strike drizzles, massed, pogoing ignition-rev dashes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Things get hairier on the wild, freewheeling back half. Nine-minute ""Knowing"" glides from steamrolling prog-metal sludge to pulse-lowering snarl and back, while ""Pink Sweat"" genuflects at the glowering low-end of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3763-shellac/"">Shellac</a>, eventually shoving white-hot dynamism so deep into the red that the song all but disintegrates. The overall effect, for the uninitiated, amounts to sort of a bait-and-switch, like early, aggro <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"">Black Flag</a> giving way mid-set to late, furiously self-indulgent Black Flag.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Lyrically, </span><i>UFO Rot </i><span>mines themes of discomfort that complement the music’s restlessness, with the sneered non-sequiturs of co-vocalists Jim Marlowe and Ryan Davis calibrated to alienate and reject. ""Any thought, if peeled, will pull apart,"" the duo deadpan on the title track. ""Heehaw Collider"" is home to a tortured refrain of ""I can’t complain,"" while the lyric ""it’s my intention to refuse you"" turns up on two different songs. What fuels Tropical Trash, ultimately, is a raw, generous anxiety—borne of youth, borne of aimlessness, borne of limitlessness—so communicable that it’s nearly anthemic. If that seems slight, it’s certainly worth remembering that cults have been built on much less.</span></p></div>"|20596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20596-ufo-rot/|7.2|Raymond Cummings

He signed to a major label, he scored a few hit singles (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98HX5nbsCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pop That""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1FK7yKRVXQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Freaks""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD6AfcoG4o8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ain’t Worried About Nothin""</a>) and released his debut album, <i><a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18178-french-montana-excuse-my-french/"">Excuse My French</a></i><i>,</i> on the strength of said singles. Since the record's release, though, French’s name attracted greater attention for dating Khloé Kardashian than any music he’s put out. <i>Casino Life 2: Brown Bag Legend,</i> his first solo project since <i>Excuse My French</i><i>, </i>appears to show that life's been good since we last heard from him.</p>
<p>The Morocco-born and South Bronx-raised rapper has never shied away from sharing the spotlight on a given song, which was often to <i>Excuse My French</i>'s detriment. <i>Casino Life 2</i> takes new stylistic turns with each new guest appearance, most of which reveal French’s overlooked rapping versatility. The monolithically dark sound that gained him attention beyond New York City a few years ago with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrCROBdNp0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Choppa Choppa Down""</a> is still heard on the lumbering ""Hard Work"" and ""Body Numb Full of Drugs"", but the soulful opener ""Hang On (Intro)"" and closer ""To Each His Own (Outro)"" offer a new perspective with a more inward turn, a welcome respite from the rest of the tape’s tiring drug-lord myth building.</p>
<p>Still, the clichéd subject matter is where French Montana sounds the most comfortable, as he raps about enjoying the spoils of life. He name drops label-boss Diddy numerous times and there's a Diddy-like top-of-the-world giddiness on ""I Ain’t Gonna Lie"" and ""5 Mo"". It doesn’t hurt that the latter track is produced by trap mastermind TM88 and features young hotshots <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32825-travi-scott/"">Travi$ Scott</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"">Lil Durk</a>, so French can rap ""Fall asleep in the East/ Wake me up on the West"" knowing the rest of the talent can pilot the track. That intoxicating aesthetic holds up <i>Casino Life 2</i> so that ""Moses"", an ingenious pairing of Chris Brown and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>, can sit on the same tape as a classic smoked out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"">Curren$y</a> track (""In the Sun""). The ability to weave between such varied styles holds everything together, even when weighed down by mediocre features from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7625-william/"">will.i.am</a>.</p>
<p>A little more than a week after the tape was released, French’s longtime partner and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59609-coke-boys-rapper-chinx-dead-at-31/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">frequent collaborator Chinx was shot dead</a> in Queens, New York. <i>Casino Life 2</i> was released a week before his untimely death, but when Chinx appears on ""Off the Rip"", the triumphant turns solemn. The weight of what happened to Chinx hangs over the tape, but by the time it ends French's overriding joy is impossible to ignore.</p></div>"|20621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20621-casino-life-2-brown-bag-legend/|6.4|David Turner

The Toronto-via-Halifax trio’s sludgy psych-rock may be too alternately scabrous and cerebral to be classified as metal, unless you’re talking about the actual physical material: This stuff is leaden and impenetrable, with visible signs of rusting and corrosion.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On paper, Crosss appear to be a band that has recorded two albums, but really, they’re more like two different bands that have made four EPs. <i>LO</i> adheres to the dichotomous structure of 2013’s <a href=""https://crosss.bandcamp.com/album/obsidian-spectre"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Obsidian Spectre</i></a>, treating its two sides as discrete canvasses to display dramatically different paintings—one rigidly formalist, one imposingly abstract. The former sees March, bassist Ryan Allen, and drummer Nathan Doucet pushing the first album’s acidic aesthetic—whimsical, wandering Syd Barrett-like musings set atop the doomy drones of mid-'90s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>—toward a more accelerated state of decay. Rather than try to showcase Crosss’ impressive onstage power in all its woofer-blasting glory, <i>LO</i> burrows deeper into the murk—on songs like ""Interlocutor"" and ""Mind"", Crosss come off like an early-'70s free-festival attraction sinking into quicksand mid-set.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though they average out at three minutes, the tracks on<i> LO</i>’s first side are overstuffed with riffs that are complicated enough to be guitar solos, and melodies that swerve and circle back like a bumblebee’s flight path. But the songs are all complex in precisely the same way—nearly every one of them begins with March launching into one of his byzantine verses within the first five seconds, leaving the band little time to establish a distinct identity for each track, and despite the constant rhythmic change-ups happening underneath, the overall pace never moves beyond a lumbering lurch. (Even when March unplugs for the acoustic anomaly ""Dance Down"", there’s no reprieve from the album’s uniformly grim atmosphere—if anything, unfettered lines like ""how can you corrupt my mind?"" only enhance the pervading sense of psychosis.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As such, the 18-minute guitar-scraped soundscape—dubbed ""Enthroning the 4 Acts""—that comprises <i>LO</i>’s back half feels less like a free-form indulgence than a necessary break from side one’s constricting schematic, with undulating waves of feedback gradually yielding to a surprisingly affecting symphony of feedback squeals in the piece’s dying moments. But despite their seemingly oppositional intents, the two halves of <i>LO</i> prove oddly complementary. If <i>LO</i>’s shorter, melodic songs find March projecting the dark majesty of a crazed king madly circling the halls of his empty palace as the peasants outside prepare to revolt, ""Enthroning the 4 Acts"" is the sound of it burning to the ground.</p></div>"|20581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20581-lo/|7.0|Stuart Berman

K. Paul</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28714-jai-paul/"">Jai</a>’s equally elusive brother. A. K. was revealed to have had a hand in some of his bro’s best tracks, writing and playing on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13378-jasmine/"">""Jasmine""</a> as well as contributing the unforgettable vocals on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12181-jai-paul-btstu-edit/"">""BTSTU (Edit)""</a> demo. Paul's contribution was an intriguing development, to be sure, but the news of his involvement threatened to overshadow the spectacular talent of Nao in her own right. The Hackney native seemed to emerge fully-formed, with an arresting, lean-muscled falsetto and a spiritual connection with turn-of-the-millennium R&amp;B and soul, the kind of bond you only have with the music of your young teenage years. And while the EP’s introductory collaboration was charming in its Paul-isms—the brothers’ trademark diaphanous, multi-layered synth collage work—the following four tracks were even better, peaking with stunning closer <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/thisnao/nao-adore-you"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Adore You""</a>, a graceful midtempo glide that felt like an answer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a>’s instant classic ""Adorn"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There’s no word yet as to whether either Paul brother is involved with Nao’s second release, the five-track </span><i>February 15</i><span> EP, but the stylistic overlap is still there. All excel at recontextualizing their '90s-leaning influences into something that feels fresh and not too on-the-nose; their old souls are self-evident without devolving into Instagram-filter-retro wedding playlist pastiche à la ""Uptown Funk"" or ""Blurred Lines"". There’s a significant distinction between Nao’s work and the Pauls’, though. In the brothers’ collaborations, the visible seams are a part of the appeal, emphasizing the individual parts of the busy, loose patchwork. On </span><i>February 15</i><span>, Nao plays with just as many disparate influences—purple-hued funk, smoky neo-soul, muted washes of dubstep and other UK bass permutations, the faint pulse of deep house—but integrates them so seamlessly that the stylistic breadth barely registers.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The <i>So Good</i> EP kept a brisk, grown-and-sexy steppers’ pace, its midtempo strut gesturing back towards acts like Groove Theory, 702, and Zhané, or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy Elliott</a> in slinky <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BjkKjdZd9k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Pussycat""</span></a> mode. On <i>February 15</i>, Nao delves into the neo-soul movement of the same time period, her stride taking on a bit of a hiccupping pimp step as house influences give way to straight funk. ""Inhale Exhale"" and ""Zillionaire"" are pure Soulquarian homage, but Nao shakes the dust off with idiosyncratic, slightly abstracted percussion that seems to have a gently rebellious will of its own.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When we think about the sounds and aesthetics of the late '90s and early '00s, the most immediate images are the Y2K retrofuturism of so much R&amp;B, pop, and rap of that time—the wide-eyed and imaginative embrace of these idealistic, spacey digital aesthetics. Think of the cavernous, glossy, white and metallic digitally-rendered chambers that served as backdrops for Janet Jackson or Blaque videos. This utopian vision made sense in an era where people were still wrapping their minds around the baffling expanse of the Internet. On this EP, Nao deals in what feels like the converse of these aesthetics: Instead of constructing idealistic projections of the future, she seems to prefer a nostalgic, tender vision of the not-so-distant past, assembled with shiny new tools and contextualized by the world we live in now.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the main draw of the EP is Nao’s vocals, rich and subtle and instinctually aware of when to dial it down and when to let her upper register flex its full strength. She has an imaginative yet piercingly simple way with words; her lyrics are unembellished but specific, stirring in their directness like an unexpectedly moving still-life painting. Her calm micro-narratives are rendered in dazzling hi-def and zoomed in to minute details like a ""Planet Earth"" freeze-frame, often focusing on the self-evident lushness of nature: images of fruits and changing seasons and rich jewel tones. ""Your silver hair, your red and checked shirt, buttoned to your apple,"" she sings, soaking in her partner on closing track ""It’s You"", capturing the essence of a quiet moment in one calm, precise stroke.</p></div>"|20620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20620-february-15-ep/|8.4|Meaghan Garvey

Now we have <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/surprise-album-fatigue.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Surprise-Album Fatigue</a>. Granted, Tanlines don’t answer to as big of an audience as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake"">Justin Timberlake</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a>. But they deserve an immense amount of credit for constructing a rollout for <i>Highlights</i> that likely could’ve gone on for another two years without complaint. The Brooklyn duo’s second LP was teased with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59152-tanlines-launch-netflix-parody-site/"">Netflix-aping website</a>, and ""premiered"" with a fake <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1799609/tanlines-streaming-new-album-highlights-via-conference-call/news/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""conference call""</a>, which featured some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/396-the-ballad-of-vaginal-mustard-snl-star-vanessa-bayer-advises-the-worst-named-bands-on-earth"">""Sound Advice""</a> from ""SNL""'s Vanessa Bayer. Eric Emm and Jesse Cohen’s charming social media presence had long established that they’re ""one of us"" and they’re the change we want to see in Music Nerd Twitter: clever, but not snarky, self-aware but not overly self-conscious, willing to poke fun at the inherent silliness of PR, album cycles, and branding without framing the whole affair as meaningless. Now, very little of this innovation or irreverence or ingenuity carries over to <i>Highlights</i>, but the goodwill Tanlines have generated isn’t all for naught. It just allows one to see the divergence between the rollout and the record as an unfortunate coincidence rather than a cynical cover-up.</p>
<p>There is a kernel of truth behind the Tanlines-as-TV joke: think of them as the offbeat comedy that got picked up after accumulating a fanbase while muscling through an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16406-tanlines-mixed-emotions/"">erratic first season</a>. For the second go-round, reinvention would be unwise or impossible, so the goal is to capitalize on the quirky chemistry of its leads and modify it to establish replicable consistency. Or, to make it ready for syndication; Tanlines <i>are</i> much more effective as a singles act than as the subject of an immersive binge listen.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The duo are a study in compatibility rather than contrast, each favoring brassy, spotless tones, Emm’s vocals sounding as much a synthesized version of a real instrument as the actual synthesizers. While male vocalists in this realm typically rely on a bass register to convey sage wisdom, sex appeal, or a sinister aura, for Emm it’s a means of foregrounding Tanlines’ everydude appeal. It works in conjunction with the often maddening mundanity of <i>Highlights</i> lyrics: ""I fall to pieces when you’re away,"" he sings on the opener, the implication being that this meltdown will be short-lived and she’ll definitely be back, probably sometime after the holiday weekend. They’re modest songs for modest moments, occupying the space between the hookup and the breakup, of getting hired and getting fired, that manageable lovesickness, regret, and anxiety that underlie just about every URL and IRL interaction.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the essence of Tanlines lies in the contrast created by the simplicity of their songwriting and the luxury of the sound design. Imagine a child winning a contest where his Construx design is turned into an actual skyscraper; that's <i>Highlights</i>. There isn’t much distance from what could’ve started out as FruityLoops demos or factory presets—Cohen’s arrangements still don’t provide much texture or polyphony. But the post-production is crucial all the same, allowing <i>Highlights</i> to sound like a legitimate pop record rather than shareware.</p>
<p>This time out, they recorded in a church with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear"">Grizzly Bear</a>’s Chris Taylor rather than in Miami with Jimmy Douglass (Foreigner, Timbaland)<span>—</span>it’s the reverse of what you’d expect from a band trying to update their sound from 2012 to 2015. But Tanlines aren’t really about staying on trend anyways. Since they work with a limited number of tools, it’s often difficult to distinguish one <i>Highlights</i> song from the next, or even remember them 10 minutes after they've ended. However, when it’s a Tanlines song, you <i>definitely</i> know it’s them. It’s an impressive accomplishment for an act that once appeared destined to be a footnote from Brooklyn Indie Rock 2010, a couple of scene mainstays who got more out of tropical keyboard presets than any New Yorker since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5427-swizz-beatz/"">Swizz Beatz</a>.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Highlights</i> hightails down the same escape routes that have been overbooked since the turn of the decade: Balearic, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/""><i>Drive</i></a>, Caribbean rhythms, New Romantic synth-pop. As with <i>Mixed Emotions</i>, there’s the opener that doesn't oversell its anthemic ambitions (""Pieces""), the New Wave cruiser (""Slipping Away""), the one with an acoustic guitar (""Invisible Ways""). The most notable update in their software results in a track that still could’ve fit on their proper 2012 debut: ""Two Thousand Miles"" is Tanlines’ EDM moment, though the strobing synths and triplet beats are strangely muffled, meant more for an apartment party with noise restrictions rather than the festival tents where the duo have become a frequent and effective crowd pleaser.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a60ff4b6-77fd-de3b-e245-00939faf6af1"">Tanlines have proven more than capable of hosting a celebration, and they can attract a surprisingly massive flock of hands-in-the-air party people as well. That shouldn’t change, as <i>Highlights</i> is more consistent than its predecessor, which was propped up by a few tentpole singles. But Tanlines could also be the center of the affair, particularly when Emm fearlessly leaned into big pop hooks during <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKJ3z9Pa7AU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All of Me""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtijpfnJzMo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Real Life""</a>. Those moments are sorely lacking on <i>Highlights, </i>which becomes defined by its deceiving sort of consistency: maintaining a baseline pleasantry that makes the title into the only unintentional punchline of the whole campaign.</span></p></div>"|20571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20571-highlights/|5.8|Ian Cohen

M. Barrie's <i>Peter Pan</i>: ""If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colors suspended in the darkness."" That description, which sounds a bit like a compositional prompt <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"">Yoko Ono</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"">John Cage</a> might have come up with, happened to correspond with her image of love. But not just romantic love, and definitely not Hallmark Cards' definition—more like love as a cosmic thing, boundless and electric; love as the connective tissue of the universe. ""Love is not only pink ribbons and sugar, it is a living thing, it is sudden, it is insane,"" she says.</p>
<p>Smurphy's synaesthesia game must be strong, because <i>Shapeless Pool</i> sounds, in fact, like all those things at once—a squirmy living being, writhing, twitching, sticky sweet. Smurphy comes from Mexico's <a href=""http://naafi.mx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NAAFI</a> crew, which made its name by putting an idiosyncratic spin on jagged, avowedly marginal styles, from moombahton to tribal guarachero to Jersey-inspired club. But she makes a good fit on <a href=""http://leavingrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leaving</a>, an L.A. label, run by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28977-matthewdavid/"">Matthewdavid</a>, that specializes in outer-limits music from artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31572-ras-g/"">Ras G</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30175-m-geddes-gengras/"">M. Geddes Gengras</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32885-knxwledge/"">Knxwledge</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a>. She is a psychedelic artist at heart, with an approach that goes to the marrow of the mind/body dichotomy.</p>
<p>There are two main facets to her music: hazy ambient and machinelike footwork. The rhythms, played out on high-pitched electronic toms and leathery hand-drum samples, move so fast that they seem almost to stand still. And the haze, meanwhile, works in the opposite way: as a nearly static, gelatinous mass that gradually yields a wealth of detail, the longer you look at it. It all seems simple, lo-fi, even a little bit crude, but it turns out to be wildly complex, and impossible to take in all at once: Every time one thing is revealed, something else is hidden. It's the mountaineer's dilemma: you can focus on the sparkling mineral in the rock face or the overwhelming bulk of the mountain itself, but you can't appreciate both at once.</p>
<p>Whatever the track markers might indicate, these aren't so much discrete songs as passages that flow together into long, seamless movements. (The album's only physical release is on cassette, which feels appropriate.) Chiming guitars and whirring drums create a bridge from the opener into the sketch-like ""Sunset"", in which birds chirp in time to the high-frequency hiccup of cell-phone interference, and on into ""Aquarius Risinn"", a breakbeat cut that sounds like a fusion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"">DJ Shadow</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3061-tujiko-noriko/"">Tujiko Noriko</a>, with a nod to <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQdHW9_G7Jo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sounds of North American Frogs</a></i>. At the end of side one, ""Le Doppe Shoppe"" offers time-stretched trance arpeggios over haywire son-clave rhythms and drunken bumblebee buzz; karate-flick gongs ease the transition into ""PyramiDUB"", in which the bees persist, but the rhythm morphs into a pattern reminiscent of grime, only hammered out on a tin roof.</p>
<p>The B-side opens with more gongs and bells and bowls, watery invocations, and streaks of white noise. Her voice rarely takes the fore, but its presence never feels far from the action, like a benevolent ghost. She sings as though no one ever told her the bars on the stave are supposed to cleave notes into discrete units, but it's not a disagreeable sensation; the way she slides around the pitch fits the general slipperiness of her music. ""Alexander.Technique"" gives us shaker-heavy footwork patterns, chants through a broken microphone, and Woody Woodpecker on military-grade amphetamines. It all drops 40 beats per minute for ""Lean&amp;Mean"", a woozy coda that rides a skronking sax/bass line. Then she lets it fly for the closing ""Pisces"": doorbell-buzz keyboards, Morse-code kick drums, and all manner of incidental clatter, including something that sounds like a typewriter attacking a milkshake. To drive home the title, there is even the sound of splashing water.</p>
<p>It is welcoming and bewildering in equal measure, and the same could be said for ""J A R D Í N"", an A-side highlight, and one of the few things here that would make sense on its own, or dropped into another context, like a DJ mix. Where most of the album is as hazy as the skies over Mexico City, this one's all empty space punctuated by small, slivery sounds: woody hand drums, thimblefuls of sampled voice, crystalline trumpets, a hi-hat played by a drummer with restless-leg syndrome. A record scratches back and forth, less hip-hop than a cartoon approximation of hip-hop. Jerking and throbbing, the track evokes a kind of rubbery pointillism, a surrealistic meeting of mallet and gummy bear. It dissolves into a pitched-down snippet of movie dialogue, and then, with ""Wicked"", we're back into more familiar terrain: Rhodes riffing, Smurphy's own watery coos, a child's voice gibbering ""The wicked!"" It's the <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> wheelhouse, and for a moment, it feels almost like solid ground. Then the loops speed up, handclaps scatter like a flock of pigeons, and we're back in Smurphy's own incomparable world, living and sudden and sugary, our perception stretched taut between the forest and the trees.</p></div>"|20589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20589-a-shapeless-pool-of-lovely-pale-colours-suspended-in-the-darkness/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

Erratic glitch, overbearing gabber, pitiless techno, violent jungle, persnickety IDM—they all melt away under the healing balm Kid606 finds in ambient music. And it's been so for a decade and a half now. Since he first ditched the caustic digital processes of <i>Down With the Scene</i> to bathe in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4407-the-soccergirl-ep/""><i>The Soccergirl</i> EP</a> and <i>P.S, I Love You</i>'s crystalline, ambient ephemera, the California native has continued to sneak out of the rave and into the chillout room. Recent albums found Kid606 increasingly enchanted by that space: Never mind that 2012's <i>Lost in the Game</i> sported backlit atmospherics and titles like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhj3UUAt660"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gimme Summer""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkdEOz4NZi4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Step Into the Light You Fucking Idiot""</a>, the soft-focused<i> </i><i>Happiness</i> followed with a full-on embrace of the changing mood. In a sense, Kid606 has been settling down.</p>
<p>Though De Pedro's habits aren't entirely predictable, he can usually be counted on to issue some kind of musical mood stabilizer sooner or later. <i>Recollected Ambient Works, Vol. 1: Bored of Excitement</i><span> is that exact maneuver, but it's also something unheard of from the electronics specialist: a piano album. Which actually isn't all that surprising. Given De Pedro's trend towards the melodic, it seems natural that the escape he seeks now is peaceful contemplation. You can imagine these seven pieces as a sanctuary: cavernous, majestic, and warm.</span></p>
<p>Restrained and stately, <i>Bored of Excitement</i><span> searches for a quiet joy in austere processed piano compositions. De Pedro never shies from an upwards chord change, favors the bright twinkle of high-octave harmonies, and is sure to work in a resounding strike of every titular root chord (""A Minor"", ""B Minor"", etc.). And all post-production treatments—i.e. heavy room reverb, barely perceptible delays, time stretching, slow filter sweeps, and additional synth washes—are only meant to enhance the soft halo of light around his performances. There are moments, however, when electronic flourishes and swollen drones gently overcome the simple piano progressions, and they feel like a pointed effort to give </span><i>Bored of Excitement</i><span> a bit of Kid606's rambunctious heart. Better late than never, ""F Minor"" and ""G Minor"" both make necessary ripples in a record that assumes still waters will always be deep.</span></p>
<p>De Pedro's arrangements default on minimalism and thoughtful euphoria. The techniques suit him, too, even when they seem to articulate his inexperience with piano. Most of the album is set against backdrops of humming incidentals and tonal whorls, which sound rapturous up to the point that they become a nuisance. ""C Minor"", for instance, basks in the glow of a brilliant counter-melody and its sonorant trails, whereas ""E Minor"" further muddles already nebulous chord phrasings with the stagnant din they create. With all the mist hanging in the air, the rare occasions that we hear an untreated piano are somehow rendered miraculous in their clarity.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-dbd415b4-748c-2742-b92c-d7346be34936""><i>Bored of Excitement</i>'s brief liner notes state that De Pedro began work on the record in Berlin during 2012, ending three years later in Los Angeles. Yet the music does little to reflect the time and space he spanned or the changes he underwent—to its benefit. Each of the seven pieces feels fluid and seamless in sequence, like an orchestral movement slowly building to crescendo for the finale. Which is commendable coming from an artist known for hammering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agm3NLaqeKk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Missy Elliott</span></a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ZPBrf9q1A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Kylie Minogue</span></a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1UoN79-8-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>N.W.A.</span></a> songs into cyberpunk dancefloor salvos.

That <i>Bored of Excitement</i> is only De Pedro's first volume of such music means he's off to a promising start.</span></p></div>"|20602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20602-kid-606-recollected-ambient-works-vol-1-bored-of-excitement/|6.9|Patric Fallon

Over the course of seven records the Parisian producer has doggedly followed the throwback trends of the moment. Early records contributed to a global surplus of California-by-way-of-Detroit hip-hop; a few years later, he and a lot of other people started rooting around in big, breezy synthesizer lines, one nation under a Sonics snapback. Onra never released a bad album in this decade-long span, but he also never exactly released a good one, all defined by an ineluctable acceptableness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But there were a handful of easy-listening bangers spread throughout those records, the sort of amber-hued boom-bap that transcends trend and reference point (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU9kkxcnW6U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sitting Back""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YikYYdTaa2U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hold Tight""</a>), and on <i>Fundamentals</i> he finally locks into that easy groove front to back. The result feels immediately like his best album, or at least his most fun one. The title implies a return to basics, but in practice it’s the opposite: the productions, which look heavily to late-'80s and early-'90s R&amp;B and pop-rap, are dizzyingly diffuse in places. Many, such as ""Like You Miss Me"" and ""Over &amp; Over"", traffic in the same gauzy washes of sound as 2012’s <i>Deep in the Night</i>, but less as a matter of course and more as a purposeful counterpoint to the other, crisper tracks here. It’s Onra’s most writerly album: even if it’s all verse-chorus-verse stuff, it’s a delight to hear the hi-hats on ""Every Second"" rush headlong into the hook, breathless as the beat itself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Don’t let the romantic notes fool you, though: this is low-bitrate barbecue-rap, good on nice speakers but fine coming off a laptop because you’re day-drunk and the playlist was too short. I don’t mean this as faint praise: <i>Fundamentals</i> is purposefully feather-light stuff, and its bounty of guest vocalists seem to intuit this and accordingly not give a shit. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31995-chuck-inglish/"">Chuck Inglish</a> and <a href=""https://thedoppelgangaz.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Doppelgangaz</a> drop the sort of placeholder raps that normally only fans of J-pop get to hear (sample lyric: ""I might buy you a scone, or get you a streusel/ This ain’t no Kool-Aid drink mix, it’s Metamucil""), and a parade of professional crooners find their voices phasing in and out of the mix. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1243-do-or-die/"">Do or Die</a> and <a href=""http://www.dazdillinger.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daz Dillinger</a> stop by to lend credibility to Onra’s Kangol-era fetishism, his transcontinental, trend-agnostic vision of '90s hip-hop approximating the way it might be experienced in the post-streaming era.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, these vocal performances, so consistently characterless that it seems to be an artistic intention, point to the very thing the album lacks: a soul. At this point Onra is a portal to his own influences rather than a synthesis or evolution of them; <i>Fundamentals</i> is essentially an album-length recommendation to dig into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7717-mary-j-blige/"">Mary J. Blige</a>’s early works. This is fine advice, but damning for Onra. His dream of the '90s is frequently beautiful and wholly sincere, but increasingly creepy, full of uncanny-valley hooks and rappers whose facial features seem to blur and morph. Why these people are together is unexplained; the reference points all point to other reference points, an endless loop of hyperlinks atop a glitchy .gif of someone popping champagne. <i>Fundamentals</i>, like every other Onra album, is a well-timed evocation of the past, slotting neatly alongside recent work by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"">Devonté Hynes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28205-kindness/"">Kindness</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">How to Dress Well</a>, and many others, but there is a difference Onra still doesn’t grasp between being <i>of</i> the moment and being a part of it.</p></div>"|20580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20580-fundamentals/|5.5|Clayton Purdom

The Bay Area composer and singer’s work percolates in the mind first, unlike the elemental club music that informs its sprightly tempos and ebbing bass. But though Herndon’s music is at its core ""cerebral""—all surface details and richly layered textures—it still exhibits warmth and emotion. Herndon’s ambitious vision was already clear on her first album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17356-movement/""><i>Movement</i></a>, but her range broadened and deepened across a slow but steady stream of intoxicatingly dense singles; <i>Platform </i>is the most complete representation of her music yet. </p>
<p>Herndon constructs synth patches from the sound of her voice, whether she’s murmuring, singing tunefully, or on the verge of shrieking. But she also processes and sequences acoustic sounds derived from movement and disorder (what could be shattering glass, a bucket being poured out, the tapping of a keyboard, the swish of a dancer’s legs), molding samples until they no longer reference the action that produced them. Even with the processing, her tracks retain an organic quality, something fleshy that suggests a given sound once existed in space.</p>
<p>Into these complicated soundworlds—all of which are rooted in human action—Herndon mixes noises that emanate from the structure of her computer (hums, fan whirs, ""thinking"" noises), as well as its internal audio (she records the sound of her Internet activity and uses it as a source material or a point of inspiration). For her, a laptop is a natural extension of her mind and body rather than a place of escape and self-negation. <i>Platform</i> is animated by a constant conversation between these two elements: the embodied vocalist (usually Herndon) and the digital ghosts in the machine.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_3mCDJ_iWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a>, music<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_3mCDJ_iWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> videos</a>, or on her <a href=""http://hollyherndon.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>, Herndon spells out her themes and methods. She seems to consider her art as, by design, didactic: In its form and process, it emulates a utopian societal model, one for the next phase of the technological age. Her music offers a vision of a time in which our digital accoutrements might become places for self-expression and improvement, and our relationship with them is less fraught. Herndon doesn’t believe that her work exists in a vacuum; it signifies in all directions, and is tied to and defined by everything around it. By explaining her music, she seeks to set up a more direct relationship with her audience. Clarifying the experiment is, to some extent, part of the whole project.</p>
<p>There’s always the danger that channeling our listening according to an artist’s directives means we’ll miss out on engaging with the music in more personally significant ways. But though Herndon unifies her pieces with clear conceptual frameworks, the moment-to-moment experience stokes our subjective impressions. The best of Herndon’s compositions function something like the age-old visual illusion of the <a href=""http://www.marcofolio.net/images/stories/fun/imagedump/faces_everywhere/two_faces_young_old.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">young woman with the big hat</a>, who could just as easily be, on second look, <a href=""http://www.marcofolio.net/images/stories/fun/imagedump/faces_everywhere/two_faces_young_old.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a babushka-wearing grandmother</a>. You might focus on the cold digital debris or the human voice crying out one minute and a melody or a meaningful lyric the next. At transcendent moments—busier, murkier work like ""Interference"" or ""Home""—Herndon offers an unclassifiable combination of the two.</p>
<p>The previously released single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16544-chorus/"">""Chorus""</a> provides the album's sonic template. It builds and settles expertly, as if catered toward the energy of a dancefloor in real time, and packs an earwormy wordless chorus. But it breaks through the wall of techno-informed percussion and synth pulsations only sporadically, like a lament filtered through a bad cell connection, or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27589-fever-ray/"">Fever Ray</a> melody submitted to John Cage-like randomized subtractive processes. Transitional notes fall out like baby teeth and at points the whole thing breaks down into digital chaos—here, Herndon’s Internet chatter is like a primordial ooze the song emerges out of and back into.</p>
<p>Those who loved the pop acuity of ""Chorus"" won’t find much else on <i>Platform</i> as persuasive in that vein. In fact, the record’s only weak moments come when Herndon adopts pop song structures instead of self-generated ones. ""Morning Sun"", in particular, is based around low, unembellished melody which doesn’t develop anywhere in particular, accompanied by tittering, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5258-dan-deacon/"">Dan Deacon</a>-like arpeggios of vocal phonemes. To liven things up, Herndon lays on threatening sheets of noise atop the mix, but they seem unrelated to the action going on underneath.</p>
<p>The most effective tracks offer something more open and spacious. ""Unequal"" highlights Herndon’s distinctive sense of harmony, which often has a haunting, irresolute quality recalling Baroque church music or plainchant. ""DAO"" also highlights her operatic vocalizations, but this time, they play a vicious game of cat-and-mouse with unstable, rough-hewn percussion patches built from everyday sounds (the approach strongly recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"">Matthew Herbert</a>’s work sampling household sounds to create elaborate virtual instruments, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"">Matmos</a>’ surgery-noise drum circles).</p>
<p><i>Platform</i>’s most unusual track sets aside Herndon's usual generative techniques. ""Lonely at the Top"" is designed to induce <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ASMR</a> (autonomous sensory meridian response), a scientifically unexplained process in which exposure to certain sounds induce a tingling sensation on the necks and scalps of the susceptible. Herndon and her collaborator, ASMR sound artist Claire Tolan, adopt the general M.O. of the vibrant and extensive ASMR YouTube community, which is home to endless webcam videos featuring gentle, stylized whispering and tapping sounds. Behind Tolan’s comforting voice, Herndon contributes small, intimate sounds: extremely closely miked and subtly processed, they give the track—an ode to one online enclave that has succeeded in accessing the corporeal in a virtual environment—an otherworldly quality.</p>
<p>It's hard to craft avant-garde music that feels truly new; inevitably, new languages correct and build off of the old ones, and create accidental resonances with others. Holly Herndon, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XmHQkFo_co"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">by her own account</a>, still believes in a music of ""now."" She eschews the free-associative, playful juxtapositions of fully synthetic sounds preferred by computer-music peers like PC Music's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32520-a-g-cook/"">A. G. Cook</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"">James Ferraro</a>, and insists on building her sound palette from the ground up, or more accurately, outwards from herself. Despite the wide scope of her project, Herndon’s ambitious efforts are appealingly multifaceted and personal, and <i>Platform </i>may turn out to be the most thought-provoking experimental electronic music release of the year. It doesn’t present a solid, replicable blueprint for the future of laptop composition and performance practice, but comes over more like beta of an app, with a lot of room for further development and expansion.</p></div>"|20457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20457-holly-herndon-platform/|8.7|Winston Cook-Wilson

On stage, they were just straight up better than their peers—faster, tighter, and weirder than the competition.  And then they were gone. Sort of.</p>
<p>Later in 2013, singer/guitarist John Dwyer announced that the band would go on hiatus and would cease to perform live for the foreseeable future. Not long after that, though, he announced that a new Oh Sees album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19277-thee-oh-sees-drop/""><i>Drop</i></a>, would see release early the following year. It was all a little confusing, and when the band finally did rematerialize for some tour dates, drummer Mike Shoun, guitarist Petey Dammit, and singer/keyboardist Brigid Dawson were gone from the picture. Instead, Dwyer—who'd relocated to Los Angeles—was backed by bassist Timothy Hellman and drummer Nick Murray.<br> <br> Arguably, Thee Oh Sees have always had a fluid membership, especially when it came to the band’s LPs, which Dwyer sometimes assembled entirely on his own (see 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15540-castlemania/""><i>Castlemania</i></a>). But when the guitarist stepped out from his bandmates, he tended to explore more tuneful territory, reserving the band’s heavier rock'n'roll output for the whole crew. <br> <br> <i>Mutilator Defeated at Last</i> is Thee Oh Sees' first post-hiatus LP to be recorded using the band’s re-staffed touring lineup. It sounds different from the old version of the band, but not <i>that </i>different. In the past, Oh Sees records were made more or less live, the band bashing out the songs in single takes with no or minimal overdubs. Since reformatting the group, Dwyer has become a bit more interested in the studio. As with <i>Drop</i>, this extra polish and attention benefits <i>Mutilator</i>. There are tasteful psychedelic embellishments—synth wooshes, delay trails—and new instrumentation, like electric organ and acoustic guitar. The fuzz and grime have been peeled back a little, leaving room for more density and detail.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>By the time <i>Floating Coffin </i>came out, the old version of Thee Oh Sees were at the peak of their ability on stage, but the records were starting to become slightly predictable. Each would contain a handful of fast rock songs, a few slow zone-outs, and one or two detours that broke character. In a way, swapping out his personnel has allowed Dwyer to change the band without altering that formula at all. <i>Mutilator </i>is distinctive in Thee Oh Sees' catalog because different musicians perform it—the drums are slightly swingier, there’s bass guitar rather than a Telecaster covering the low end. Everything else is pretty much the same as usual, down to the lyrics about death and decaying flesh. </p>
<p>Thee Oh Sees have one type of song that is consistently great. It’s the fast and heavy track that combines the creepy and ugly sensibility of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"">the Cramps</a> with krautrock's streamlined sense of repetition—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mZqGxkYOFY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Dream""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLsq8zPvloY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No Spell""</a>, for instance. On any given Oh Sees record, these are the songs that count the most. And<i> Mutilator</i> delivers plenty of these songs. ""Withered Hand"", ""Lupine Ossuary"", and ""Rogue Planet"" each strikes that perfect balance of druggy alienation and soothing forward motion, of sublime rhythmic focus and freaked-out guitar violence.</p></div>"|20441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20441-mutilator-defeated-at-last/|7.8|Aaron Leitko

She plotted a drastic reinvention and arranged sessions with producers who would nod along with glazed expressions before layering on Auto-Tune and ornamental synths in the studio. Exasperated, Houghton turned to nefarious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"">Bad Seed</a> Jim Sclavunos, impressed by his yen for psych bands like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lemon_Pipers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lemon Pipers</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spinach"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ultimate Spinach</a>, and developed her classic-rock chops. Then, just before hitting the studio, Houghton eviscerated the work, wrote two new tracks, and rebuilt, once more, from the ground up.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The result of the triple-distillation process is <i>Welcome Back to Milk</i>, a radical musical and psychological inversion of its predecessor. Where <i>Cellophane Nose</i> sketched an alluring wonderland, the follow-up finds Houghton, now working as Du Blonde, fierce and firm, assertive enough to know when to keep us away, at a distance that suits her. In the sense that it strives less to be pretty than honest, the album is about growing out of preconceived social roles. <i>Cellophane Nose </i>was a resplendent work of odyssey and intricacy, a feature some critics couldn’t untangle from her femininity: In a short paragraph, the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/02/beth-jeans-houghton-hooves-review"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Guardian</i></a> review describes its ""airy, fairytale quality,"" observes one song ""skipping delicately"" and compares another to ""fellow sprite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1751-goldfrapp/"">Alison Goldfrapp</a>."" Perhaps Houghton took it to heart.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So <i>Welcome Back to Milk </i>skews primal. The debut’s ukulele, harp, glockenspiel, and Wurlitzer are all out, along with any ""nu folk"" threads; in their place are Stones R&amp;B rhythms, doomed Sabbath licks, blistering Cali-punk, and a primitive kind of glam–the most flamboyant instrument Houghton employs is the voice of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/"">Future Islands</a>' Samuel T. Herring, who makes a lovelorn, pantomime-villain cameo on ""Mind Is on My Mind"". But if a picture is forming of barren blasts and ruthless efficiency, that’s not quite it: ""Four in the Morning"" is a wrenching piano ballad, ""Isn’t It Wild"" waltzes dreamily to the stars, ""Hunter"" concedes tenderness for an ex-lover. Still, what’s important is that the record <i>feels</i> fierce, is designed to, and Houghton has pulled no punches in <a href=""http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/albumcover_final_nipple_sm.jpg?wmode=transparent"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">spreading the word</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The record’s opening brace alone leaves you dazed throughout the first half: ""Black Flag"" acts out both sides of a lovers’ spat over stormy guitars, while ""Chips to Go"" thunders along on a devilish, Sparks-like riff as Houghton yells and trills theatrically. Third track ""Raw Honey"" simmers, but despite being resolutely unpunk (a frilly guitar solo consumes one-third of its runtime) the fingerpicked hook is so inescapably reminiscent of <i>Californication</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> it’s tempting to hear a pass-agg kiss off to Houghton’s ex-beau Anthony Kiedis.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The men of <i>Welcome Back to Milk </i>fare about as well as you’d expect, which is not very. On <i>Cellophane Nose</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKcdTv0reYE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Atlas""</a>, Houghton sat with her boyfriend ""dissecting the atlas for places we’ve been/ Your list is longer, but you’ve got more years on me."" Here, that sort of homey affection would feel jarring: Domesticity has become a battleground where partners pick fights (""If You’re Legal""), polish their egos (""After the Show"") and mansplain your ""issues"" (""Hard to Please""). On ""Young Entertainment"", a shimmering noir-punk number, she demands, ""What is it like to fuck your mistress with her hands tied?""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Welcome Back to Milk </i>scans as an overhaul of its protagonist’s romantic history, a poised reassessment of domestic situations that seemed okay at the time, but maybe weren’t the best, after all. Wherever her gaze turns, Houghton’s conviction is lethal. On ""Mr. Hyde"", she shreds a domineering narcissist to pieces; on ""Four in the Morning"", she shreds herself to pieces; on ""Black Flag"", she simply shreds. This all serves a winning mission statement: Radically reinterpret your past, and your present will look after itself.</span></p></div>"|20442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20442-welcome-back-to-milk/|7.4|Jazz Monroe

First was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxxstCcJlsc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Clarity""</a>, the aural equivalent of standing under a fake waterfall at Tomorrowland, and the brain-invading Hayley Williams feature <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-gyZ35074k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stay the Night""</a>. This was skyscraping stuff, and it’s a sound that the 25-year-old producer had made his name on behind the boards for artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"">Lady Gaga</a> (Zedd contributed three songs to <i>Artpop</i>) and Justin Bieber (<i>Believe</i>’s surging ""Beauty and a Beat""). In 2015, Zedd is not only <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eeel45eljle/no-7-zedd-21-million/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of the richest men in the biz</a>, he’s <a href=""http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/04/20/selena-gomez-zedd-break-up-over-justin-bieber/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a tabloid star</a>.</p>
<p>Given the higher profile, it was probably no surprise that the rumored Selena Gomez collaboration bore fruit in the form of ""I Want You to Know"", the first, Ryan Tedder-co-written single from Zedd’s new album <i>True Colors</i>. For better or for worse, ""I Want You to Know"" is a good entry point for <i>True Colors</i>, a collection of songs that features Zedd consistently failing to open up the playbook or alter the formula. Many songs—opener ""Addicted to a Memory"", ""Straight into the Fire""—feature familiar pop constructions. Not unlike his hits (including his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31708-ariana-grande/"">Ariana Grande</a> collaboration <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16977-ariana-grande-break-free-ft-zedd/"">""Break Free""</a>), Zedd routinely uses soaring synth stabs with crystal clear vocals from female singers. While it’s worked in the past, it feels like the primary colors Zedd tends to paint with feel faded.</p>
<p>Though Zedd keeps his foot on the pedal, it comes with the cost of diminishing returns. Even changes of pace like ""Beautiful Now""—male singer!—feel flat and corny (""Let’s live tonight/ Like fireflies!""). If you want vague, positive platitudes bouncing off every pocket of pixelated pomp, <i>True Colors</i> is a one-stop shop. Take ""Transmission"", a song that limply thumps around the chorus ""Cause you're never too young, you're never too young, never too young to die"" and features a verse from Maryland rapper Logic that makes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN61-4Iu598"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kalin and Myles</a> sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5406-ugk/"">UGK</a>.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to paint Zedd as a singles artist, and <i>True Colors</i> reveals that the DJ doesn’t have much to say at an album’s length. <i>True Colors</i> does traverse familiar, populous formats that may be difficult to innovate on top of, but other posi-tinted, mass audience-focused <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20379-adventure/"">projects have found success</a> by mixing their own cocktails of EDM, soul, and of-the-minute rap production.

Sure, savvy, big-name artists can use long delays between albums to their promotional advantage, parlaying pent-up anticipation into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20078-black-messiah/""><span>major cultural event</span></a>. But for the typical, blog-buzzed indie-level artist touring the same 200-cap rooms as all the other typical, blog-buzzed indie-level artists, even taking the once-standard 18-month break between releases can be a huge gamble at a time when trends and attention spans seemingly shift overnight.</p>
<p>The story of Holly Miranda, however, betrays the benefits of just letting things happen in due time. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13964-the-magicians-private-library/""><i> The Magician’s Private Library</i></a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a>-approved 2010 album that first introduced the Michigan-born, bicoastal-based singer to the world at large, technically wasn’t her debut—she self-released an album in 2004, back when she was an acoustic-strumming open-mic aspirant, and went on to make two records as the singer-guitarist for one-time Brooklyn indie-pop hopes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19487-the-jealous-girlfriends/"">the Jealous Girlfriends</a>. <i>Magician’s</i>, however, clearly marked a major turning point in Miranda’s trajectory, its fantastical fusion of southern '60s soul and hazy '80s dream-pop perfectly timed for a moment when acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28665-cults/"">Cults</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"">Girls</a> were putting similarly modernist spins on classic pop-song conventions. And in producer Dave Sitek, Miranda had found the perfect conduit between left-field experimentation and MOR accessibility, his maximally minimalist aesthetic so prevalent on the record, you’d think the album was named after his studio. (Alas, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician%27s_Private_Library#Writing_and_development"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>it was not</span></a>.)</p>
<p>But whatever momentum Miranda had acquired with <i>Magician’s</i> would slowly peter out, along with the indie-zeitgeist moment that supported her ascent. In the five years that have passed since the album’s release, all those aforementioned bands have either broken up or drifted to the edges of the cultural conversation; Miranda's XL contract gave way to crowd-funding pitches; and even her most famous cheerleader’s blog has <a href=""http://kanyeuniversecity.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>gone offline</span></a>. Miranda didn't exactly disappear, a seeming impossibility when you’ve been <a href=""http://s1.zetaboards.com/L_Anon/topic/4615023/905/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>romantically involved with everyone’s favorite ""</span>L Word""<span> star</span></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58565-scarlett-johansson-recruits-este-haim-for-girl-group-the-singles-shares-candy/""><span>joined ScarJo’s supergroup</span></a>. But her musical output slowed to a trickle, as a crippling bout of writer’s block sent her fleeing from her L.A. home in 2012 to a place that has come to signify rock'n'roll <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joshua_Tree"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>canonization</span></a> and <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-gram-parsons-dies-in-the-desert-20140919"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>immortalization</span></a>: Joshua Tree. Not one to ignore the spiritual significance of such sacred ground, Miranda used the opportunity to get born again. When she sings, ""I’ve been tripping so long"" on her new album’s opening, new-day-rising anthem ""Mark My Words"", she’s not referring to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUFQ8IBl4ms"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>the usual mode of desert-based therapy</span></a> so much as the protracted process of regaining her proper footing after an extended creative drought.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like its predecessor, Miranda’s first album in a half decade seeks to balance the earthy with the ethereal. But in contrast to the insular, hermetic environs of </span><i>The Magician’s Private Library</i><span>, this new one—produced by Miranda and Florent Barbier, with a one-song assist from Sitek—is all open road, both in its vastness of sound and fresh-start philosophies. (""I know this town could be the death of me,"" goes the chorus of ""Come On"", its Edge-inspired gallop pushing the L.A. skyline further into the rear view mirror.) It’s a self-titled release, traditional artist shorthand for ""this is the real me""—accordingly, throughout these 11 songs, Miranda projects a greater sense of confidence and candor, dispensing with the fantasy imagery of her previous record to cut straight to the heart of the matter by openly addressing matters of the heart. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Miranda was raised in a strict evangelical household, before rejecting the religious dogma that effectively rejected queer kids like herself; she originally wrote the bittersweet, drum-machined lullaby ""Pelican Rapids"" for the <a href=""http://www.itgetsbetter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It Gets Better</a> campaign, as a retroactive note of assurance to her teenage closeted self. But when it comes to expressing her distrust of ecclesiastical institutions, Miranda doesn't feel the need <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYSVMgRr6pw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>to belabor the point</span></a>; she'd rather appropriate religion's fundamental tenet—the belief in and yearning for something greater than yourself—for secular songs of devotion, and infuse them with the gravitas of modern-day hymns. (The omnipresent baritone-sax hum of Maria Eisen—this album’s star player—inches them toward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a>’s brand of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY8SyTsgSko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>celestial soul</span></a>.) And while the tumble-in-the-grass romp ""All I Want Is to Be Your Girl"" and the urgent synth-pop of ""Whatever You Want"" respectively document the idyllic beginnings and bitter end of a relationship between two women, Miranda is more liable to write transcendence-seeking songs—like wedding first-dance candidates ""Everlasting"" and ""The Only One""—that can be applied to all sexualities and identities, implicitly promoting the sort of inclusiveness that religious orthodoxy so often denies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The result is an album that feels both disarmingly intimate and broadly universal, and Miranda's voice—fragile and fearless in equal measure—mesmerizes even when the lyrics veer toward non-descript platitudes. But she is occasionally guilty of forcing her hand. The moonlit elegy ""Desert Call""—an elaborate reworking of a <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/hollymiranda/holly-miranda-desert-call"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stripped-down 2013 single</a> recorded with Sitek—boasts the album’s most dramatic, chandelier-rattling performance, but the extended closing chorus of ""hallelujah"" oversells the weightiness of a song that’s already done much to establish itself as this album’s epic centerpiece. (It also feels like an overly on-the-nose evocation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8AWFf7EAc4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>a song re-popularized</span></a> by one of<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP-wp7J8cNg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span> Miranda’s biggest influences</span></a>.) A better measure of Miranda’s re-stoked bravado comes with ""Until Now"", slotted into the climactic penultimate-track position, but stripped down to just guitar and piano. Like the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF8fnoA1VNM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>nocturnal</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub9N8IP8hao"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span> serenades</span></a> that fill up the back half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>’s <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>, it’s a song that gently guides an emotional roller coaster of an album towards its peaceful conclusion. ""I never opened my eyes till now,"" Miranda sings, before pledging herself to a long-time crush. ""You’ve got some kind of sweetness/ Tied up in that string I’ve been tugging on/ But I’m pulling now."" For a lapsed church-goer like her, it’s a moment of spiritual awakening that no preacher could inspire.</p></div>"|20604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20604-holly-miranda/|7.4|Stuart Berman

""Let's go for a rollercoaster ride—even a shit rollercoaster ride."" The lines are pure punk while everything around them is anything but: Taylor sounds like the universe's loneliest astronaut as synth pulses blink in blackness behind him. The song is called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVoBxKGCXa0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Burning Up""</a> and it's vintage Hot Chip: funny where it might be wistful; wistful where it might be funny. It also serves as a mini-history of the London quintet, who first formed 15 years ago. As the song moves along, youthful abandon gives way to consequence, weight, blame. Co-leader Joe Goddard arrives to split the difference in the final verse. ""My age says I'm an adult but some days my heart will not be told,"" he hums as the track evaporates behind him. ""Hearing teenage symphonies dancing through my head.""</p>
<p>With <i>Why Make Sense?</i>, Hot Chip continue to capture pure joy while acknowledging the limits of such a quest. It's an adult album made by a group of guys in their mid-thirties who know all of the trappings of an ""adult album."" These ahead-of-their-time pop omnivores—remember the bewilderment that surrounded the bedroom Prince and Stevie-isms of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4028-coming-on-strong/"">debut album</a> in 2004?—are now, remarkably, something of an institution, their eclecticism the new normal. They used to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>’s brainy British counterparts (the two bands even shared a member in guitarist Al Doyle), but now LCD are gone, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5462-james-murphy/"">James Murphy</a> is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59551-james-murphy-is-opening-a-wine-bar-in-williamsburg/"">opening wine bars</a>, and Hot Chip are still here, still looking for spontaneity, still hopelessly bittersweet, still trying to get better, still romantic, still funkier than a bunch of pasty dudes from Putney have any right to be, still making it cool to dance even if you can’t dance for shit.</p>
<p>This is the smoothest Hot Chip album, and they’ve never sounded more professional. It's a mixed blessing: For a band healthily obsessed with not making sense, the refined sound can seem a bit commonplace after more than a decade of spikes, jump-cuts, and curveballs. Then again, Hot Chip have always been traditionalists at heart, making pop songs that utilize the vocabularies of house, R&amp;B, and hip-hop rather than the other way around. They've stacked up plenty of bridges worthy of the Brill Building, a phenomenon that continues on the lovingly nostalgic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfH5LmhvQQk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Need You Now""</a>, which is about as close as they've come to matching the melancholy perfection of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-fu1PQWTBk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Boy from School""</a>. The wafting ""White Wine and Fried Chicken"" takes the band's high/low culture expertise into the realm of gastronomy, and feels like a soul standard for our century. The three-minute song sounds about as straightforward as anything Hot Chip have made, though there are big knots in Taylor's words; whereas much of the band's last two albums dealt with the wonders of stability and contentment, <i>Why Make Sense? </i>seems more conflicted. Existential crises abound, creating discord with the album's glossy finish.</p>
<p>Taylor and Goddard ask themselves questions that many almost-middle-aged musicians—especially in the pop and dance worlds—are too scared to broach. They try to find some clarity within the ambiguities of committed relationships (romantic or musical), exposing vulnerabilities in the name of emotional honesty. ""Out of happiness can come a bitterness,"" admits Taylor—the son of a Shakespeare scholar and psychoanalyst—on the booming title track, before mixing in confrontational politics that spin around ideas of personal freedom: ""Why be tough when strength is just for losers/ Be what you are ­at the mercy of your rulers."" Meanwhile, the mildly anti-machine-music <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S0ONyRctyE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Huarache Lights""</a> has Taylor trying to find a heartbeat between ones and zeroes, but he’s too savvy (or neurotic) to construct any bold lines. ""Am I so truthful, or in truth, is the youth just getting old?"" he sings, putting his own perspective into question. On a self-critical bonus track, Goddard suggests, ""I need to separate the head from the body,"" but he knows that can be hard to do—a fact that this album, with its bulbous grooves and anxious themes, makes clear again and again.</p>
<p><i>Why Make Sense? </i>is probably the fourth-best Hot Chip album. But that’s not necessarily a knock, because their fourth-best album is still a <i>very good</i> album. At this point, they seem too smart and talented to really fail. They will always be underdogs that you root for to make songs that highlight the complexity of human experience while also helping you to put those complexities in the back of your mind for a minute. They are confident in their abilities, even when those abilities are aimed at throwing their own confidence into doubt. They are beloved. They are trustworthy. Their senselessness now makes a lot of sense to a lot of people.</p></div>"|20506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20506-why-make-sense/|7.3|Ryan Dombal

Lakker’s <i>Tundra</i><span>, the Dublin duo's second album in a decade, delves into the uncanny valley of treated vocals, ground up and looped in with all kinds of noise. Lakker weave voices in the style of sacred music into contexts where they wouldn't normally be heard. The resulting effect is spit-shined patches of perfect sonority that make the noise sound brighter, like there’s something alive inside it.</span></p>
<p>Lakker is the project of Ian McDonnell and Dara Smith, two producers who started out as overheated noise-blast collagists on their first album, 2007's <i>Ruido</i>, and then spent a few years producing straight-ahead techno 12”s for labels like <a href=""http://www.blueprintrecords.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blueprint</a> and their current home, <a href=""http://www.randsrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R&amp;S</a>.</p>
<p><i>Tundra</i> falls somewhere outside of both of those approaches. It has the same restless spirit as <i>Ruido</i>—but while that LP was a frantic pastiche of frenetically stitched-together ideas, <i>Tundra</i>’s oddball details are all in the service of larger structures, like glyphs carved into the surface of stone blocks. Its range is too expansive and colorful to fit under the umbrella of club music. Like fellow noise artists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5684-fuck-buttons/"">Fuck Buttons</a>, whose dizzying fractal scaling on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18295-fuck-buttons-slow-focus/""><i>Slow Focus </i></a>echoes through <i>Tundra</i>’s biggest and boldest tracks, Smith and McDonnell have a loose compositional template here; they tease ideas into play with one another, elaborating but never quite releasing the tension between them. ""Mountain Divide"", the dizzying third track (and first introduction of hostile noise) buries a muffled choral fragment in chaotic whining and sawing—an ""O Fortuna"" for sparking machinery—and stays naggingly dissonant.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s a narrative quality in the sequencing that brings to mind massive planes swept clear by a destructive force, but <i>Tundra</i> is also touchingly reverent towards humanity. ""Mountain Divide"" is the beginning of a powerful three song segment that includes the luminous ""Three Songs"", and ""Ton’neru"", a wispy ambient piece reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"">Julianna Barwick</a>. One of Lakker’s claimed influences is the Estonian composer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvo_P%C3%A4rt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arvo Pärt</a>, an explorer of sacred music and Gregorian chant whose dramatically charged compositions have proved enduringly popular in film and television. Smith and McDonnell share a similar flair for concentrating emotion into refined detail.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Only one track here sounds like an exercise rather than a finished composition: ""Halite"", a steady stalactite drip of a melody that never coalesces into something more interesting, despite its near seven minutes, and slows the momentum of the album’s back half down to a sluggish chug. Given the proliferation of disaffected-sounding techno on the Internet these days, it’s easy to imagine this as a tune-out moment for listener, though nothing that follows sounds remotely like it.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-9c923a20-6cb0-16ad-cdf1-a788346518d0""><span>In fact, the closing four tracks on the album are its purest examples of industrial-strength noise—the title track, which starts out with a good-natured, ear-wormy beat that’s vaguely </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/4m48GqaOz90"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>familiar</span></a><span>, slides into a positively romantic-sounding mix of delicately ticking percussion and sonorous humming, only to double back into an apocalyptic, buzzing cloud of noise. Then there’s the final ""Herald"", a burbling, melodic composition that makes for a disarmingly sensitive come-down from the album’s often ominous landscape. That alone indicates that </span><i>Tundra </i><span>is a bid for the kind of album-based respectability that’s so difficult for techno crossover artists to achieve, and its accessibility may give momentum to R&amp;S’s own mission to revive their catalog with forward-thinking techno acts that can replicate their late '90s golden age of left-of-center psychedelic dance LPs. As with any piece of music that ebbs and flows this forcefully, you should listen to it loudly, and try to get swept away by it.</span></span></p></div>"|20570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20570-lakker-tundra/|7.8|Abigail Garnett

After he stepped into the limelight on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers/"" target=""_blank"">the Killers</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4579-hot-fuss/"" target=""_blank"">still-terrific debut</a> at 22-years-old, he made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9484-sams-town/"">three</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12505-day-age/"">more</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Born"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">records</a> with his band full of bona fide arena anthems as well as cheap knock-offs that substitute as arena anthems. The latter is why it's advisable to skip over most of his 2010 solo debut <i>Flamingos</i>, if only because the beige, desert-tinged production says and adds very little to his songwriting. The album is clunky and rote even by the Flowers metric.</p>
<p>But with the help of Grammy-winning producer Ariel Rechtshaid, <i>The Desired Effect </i>gives Flowers new backdrops to play around in. Rechtshaid doesn’t mine the '80s and '90s for inspiration like he's done for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"">Haim</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17421-carly-rae-jepsen-all-that/"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Rechtshaid#Producer_and_writer_discography"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">many others</a> recently. Instead, he straight up jacks that sound, aiming directly at those fond of the calmer side of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1170-duran-duran/"">Duran Duran</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"">Pet Shop Boys</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a>. Electric guitars are swapped out for chugging piano lines, hand-clap snares, and melismas sung by anonymous background singers; never mind the inclusion of special guest <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Hornsby</a>, a song that samples Bronski Beat's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xuz94ZIPfJk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Smalltown Boy""</a> and features Neil Tennant on vocals, and floppy disc after floppy disc worth of synth patches. Credit to Rechtshaid, the album’s big and luxe sound fits Flowers' big and luxe voice. When they sync up in this milieu, against all odds, it works really well.</p>
<p>Above these glossy textures, Flowers doubles down on his earnest goobery, which actually brings him closer to this ideal pop star image he's been chasing. Not since <i>Sam’s Town </i>has Flowers sounded so at home in song. ""Can’t Deny My Love"" is a masterclass in '80s production tricks (wooden pan flutes! pitch-wavering synth pads! orchestra hits!) with one of those famous, powerful hooks that made him so likable to begin with. It’s cheesy, but the cluster-bomb of ideas is ultimately what makes you want to go back for repeat listens. Likewise, on the mid-tempo ballad ""Never Get You Right"" Flowers finds the perfect equation for his sincerity and hyperbole. Again, it’s the hook and his voice that do most of the heavy lifting, but the song works because of a simple idea. You look at someone you know and love (who in Flowers' case is possibly a sex worker) and think how ""They’ll turn you into something whether you are it or not/ But they’ll never get you right.""</p>
<p>There are more huge Killers-ready songs to fill stadiums or casinos (""Dreams Come True"" and ""Untangled Love"") and hoary love songs (""Still Want You""), but Flowers can’t help but trip over himself as he’s writing. He’s just so daffy. He sings ""Friday nights, football stands"" and you just pray the sports imagery stops there, but sure enough, he follows it up with ""been fumbled by so many hands."" It’s always just one move too many. Sometimes he reaches for the cliché like ""ship of fools"" or ""casting...stones"" and sometimes he does some gangly inversion of one, like, ""She wasn't having anything, no birds or any bees/ Girl, don't go shootin' all the dogs down just cause one's got fleas."" At best, Flowers is too wordy and obvious. At worst, he is <a href=""https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BruceSpringsteen_ebooks</a>, cobbling together blue-collar American signifiers in odd arrays that appear to have meaning but are really just empty gestures.</p>
<p>""Whether the people want to accept it or not, we might be the best band in the last long time!” said Flowers regarding the Killers in a recent <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/brandon-flowers-interview-people-dont-appreciate-what-the-killers-achieved-10250367.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. This quote is great because it says everything you need to know about Flowers as a songwriter: He believes deeply in himself by way of absurd and often extra-grammatical reasons. At his essence, Flowers is a big beating heart that under too much scrutiny will shrivel and die. He is bound for excess and <i>Desired Effect</i> delivers on precisely that, at precisely the level you’d imagine a happily married, 33-year-old with millions of dollars in the bank would. Don’t think too much about the heavy-handed religiosity on ""The Way It’s Always Been"" or the the heartland rock aberration ""Diggin' Up the Heart"". Just let his words wash over you, subtly, like being tackled by 20 puppies. Flowers gives off charm and stupidity in the same breath and it is as comforting as it is disposable. It’s the mark of a pretty good pop star.</p></div>"|20609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20609-the-desired-effect/|5.6|Jeremy D. Larson

Despite its commonality, it’s still a risky maneuver: perhaps playing in such a stylistic straitjacket has made a band incapable of doing anything else. Even if it’s an artistically successful record, it can alienate old fans without attracting new ones. Most relevant to Ceremony, it’s a card you only get to play once. Six years after they could be accurately described as ""powerviolence,"" the Bay Area group released their John Goodmanson-produced Matador debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16374-zoo/"">Zoo</a><span>—</span></i>a slog through boggy, primordial punk, interesting for the sole fact that it was made by a former powerviolence band. Ceremony undergoes another drastic change on <i>The L-Shaped Man</i>, but it cannot be leniently judged relative to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQN_jfSyrJM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Violence Violence</i></a>. They’re now just one of the thousands of indie rock bands that really want to sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>, and sounding no more engaged with their source material than the average dude plucking an <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> graphic T off the rack at <a href=""http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/Joy+Division+Unknown+Pleasures+T-Shirt-995302.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hot Topic</a>.</p>
<p>Mind you, Ceremony are on their fifth record and are <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaiOgToofBo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>named after a Joy Division song</i></a>. But at the very least, the veritable return to their roots makes sense within the context of <i>The L-Shaped Man</i>. Ceremony are also one of the thousands of indie rock bands making a conceptual breakup record; and in these situations, such a breakup is assumed to be so catastrophic that it totally dismantles one’s self-construct and leaves nothing but foundation. Joy Division lyrics, advice from your father, bumper stickers that read ""all things pass""<span>—</span>everything you’ve been led to think is trite once you’re out of your teens might actually reveal themselves to be the truth.  </p>
<p>There’s no way to judge the authenticity of Ross Farrar’s emotions on <i>The L-Shaped Man</i>. But how can he can be exempt on an album where everything feels like facade? In particular, the facade inherent in Ceremony’s own name, as they grab at the most obvious signifiers of their idols and pass them off as their own. For one thing, Farrar’s vocals are now unrecognizable, or only recognizable as Ian Curtis karaoke. To be fair, Curtis is a natural touchstone for a punk rock carny barker, as his enduring qualities<span>—</span>the militaristic cadences, the claustrophobic melodies<span>—</span>can be approximated without much technical ability.</p>
<p>But you can’t fake his command or intensity or sonorousness, though Farrar tries. Or maybe he doesn’t try hard enough. The lyrics are delivered with honesty and presumed urgency. They are also proof that those qualities can be less important than thinking before you talk. The dishwater-gray ambience of ""Exit Fears"" implies sleepless nights filled with lingering regret, while Farrar moans, ""The pain will leave in the night/ Memories return in the light""<span>—</span>which seems to express the exact opposite of what he means. ""The root of the world is in the red heart,"" ""you saw yourself walking with no one else and it scared you""<span>—t</span>hey all aspire to be aphorisms and fade upon impact like a tweet never to be favorited. The album title itself is indicative of Farrar making observations without any insight<span>—</span>men <i>are</i> generally L-shaped, but...so?  </p>
<p>The lack of resonance is even more obvious in Farrar’s newfound tone, a monster mash of alternating cartoonish bellow and honk which doesn’t sound like Curtis or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5914-paul-banks/"">Paul Banks</a> so much as the dude from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1426-editors"">Editors</a> drunkenly imitating Paul Banks trying to sing like Ian Curtis. Of all Farrar’s means of cheating towards cogency<span>—</span>repetition of lyrics that just can’t bear the attempts at establishing portent, lending numerous song titles a definitive article to import significance—the most absurd is his <a href=""http://www.blographia-literaria.com/2008/03/bright-lights-big-city-by-jay-mcinerney.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jay McInerney-like</a> tendency to speak almost entirely in the second person. Call it <i>Turn on the Bright Lights, Big City</i>. </p>
<p>As a working unit, Ceremony still play with customary, clumsy enthusiasm. The terse drumrolls, plangent guitar fills, and basslines that are all thumbs<span>—</span>it’s all here and played with the expected looseness of a former hardcore band that moved onto garage rock and is now learning post-punk on the fly. It occasionally coalesces into a surf-goth hybrid that at least justifies <a href=""https://midheaven.com/item/modern-surf-classics-by-swami-john-reis-and-the-blind-shake-cd#.VVklHJNViko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Reis being roped into this</a>. Who knows what Ceremony expected of the former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1983-hot-snakes"">Hot Snakes</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3588-rocket-from-the-crypt"">Rocket From the Crypt</a> frontman, but his production might be more overmatched than mismatched: the confused melodies Farrar strews over the piano plunking of ""Hibernation"" and the wayward guitar leads in ""Root of the World"" can generously be heard as an experiment in avant-garde atonality. Ceremony would’ve been better off phoning a different guy from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1152-drive-like-jehu"">Drive Like Jehu</a><span>—</span>put <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/254505-Mark-Trombino?filter_anv=0&amp;subtype=Production&amp;type=Credits"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mark Trombino</a> behind the drums or the boards and he could provide a high-velocity, low-viscosity sleekness that would make relatively hooky outliers like ""The Separation"" and ""Bleeder"" go incognito on satellite radio as enjoyably derivative post-pop-punk.</p>
<p><i>The L-Shaped Man</i> does have an advantage over <i>Zoo</i>, in that it’s interesting in the way any true debacle is, where a band’s conviction is either impervious to any kind of outside intervention or just not subject to it. Just look at the album cover: almost immediately after Ceremony revealed <i>The L-Shaped Man</i>, <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/ceremony-the-l-shaped-man-the-simpsons-dignity"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fans noticed its too-hilarious-to-be-intentional similarity</a> to a gag from the ""A Millhouse Divided"" episode of ""The Simpsons."" This is better known as the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j8wLANrGBg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Can I Borrow a Feeling""</a> episode, an unfortunate coincidence seeing as how we’re talking about a record whose entire aesthetic is on loan. It’s even more serendipitous in light of the exact scene with the offending Pictionary attempt<span>—</span>there we have Kirk Van Houten, on the verge of a calamitous divorce, yelling at a dinner party crowd who reacts to his inept visual rendering of ""dignity"" with embarrassed silence. Maybe it's good for a laugh, but only as a defense mechanism against the cringe-inducing experience of watching artistic expression abandon a heartbroken man at his lowest moment.</p></div>"|20569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20569-the-l-shaped-man/|3.3|Ian Cohen

In one story she shows up at Google, ""wearing a green dress and ill fitting heels,"" and throws ""a flaming boulder straight into our servers."" In another article she starts a Twitter war with Ziggy Stardust. In every photo Ray wears an ape mask that has become her avatar on <i>Last Year’s Savage</i>—the equivalent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">Bowie</a>’s alien costume from the 1970s or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9683-bono/"">Bono</a>’s MacPhisto get-up from the '90s. The disguise itself is visually striking, albeit obscure; <i>Savage Times</i>, on the other hand, is a pitch-perfect mix of Dadaist punchlines, pointed cultural satire, meta humor, and good old-fashioned punsmithery.</p>
<p>Ray brings that same sophisticated, intensely derisive sense of humor to the songs on <i>Last Year’s Savage</i>. ""Johnny Thunder Fantasy Space Camp"" skewers the constant romanticizing of doomed rock stars—<i>male</i> rock stars, although that goes without saying. Over a '50s pop piano line and an insistent snare drum snap, she tells a would-be martyr to go ahead and fall on his sword: ""So you think you’ll die a prince in Joshua Tree…/ I won’t stop you, I’ll be rooting for you 'til my cats get the best of me."" Ray knows we have too many rock'n'roll casualties already; she’d rather play the crazy cat lady as punk icon. ""Nocturnal Emissions"" likewise upends male fantasies with similar insight and agitation, as she recounts her own dreams of gender-blurred virility over a tense rhythm section and rumbling guitar riffs: ""My dick’s bigger, my breasts are thicker, whatever power means."" Ray buys into the same overinflated rock myths she’s puncturing, perhaps because each one represents a way to transcend the limitations of the body and live a bit longer, a bit better. As she cautions on ""Nocturnal Emissions"", ""Don’t ever wake me up, bitch!""</p>
<p>A veteran of the Brooklyn scene who has recorded under various names (Beat the Devil, Shilpa Ray and Her Happy Hookers, just Shilpa Ray) and toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"">Nick Cave</a>, Ray delivers these songs in a voice that shapeshifts constantly, hitting every point along the spectrum between howl and coo, between boozy irony and acid rebuke. She does mordant accusations best of all, but there’s always enough gravity in her tone to suggest dark implications to ""O My Northern Soul"" and even ""On Broadway"". Most of Her Happy Hookers are back sans billing, emphasizing odd textures rather than melodies or riffs. Andrew Hoepfner sounds like he has an unlimited supply of Santo &amp; Johnny licks, but they’re tucked into the corners of these songs. You wouldn’t miss them if they weren’t there. Ultimately, the defining instrument on <i>Savage</i>, aside from Ray’s commanding voice, is her signature harmonium, which adds a sardonic drone to the songs.</p>
<p>Especially on the album’s second side, Ray’s lyrics are conceptually top heavy, a bit too impressed with their own cleverness. She sings ""Sanitary iPad"" from the point of view of a high-tech gadget that’s obsolete before it even hits stores. ""I’ve got a short shelf life, who’s gonna throw me out?"" she sings, merely alluding to a larger point about the disposability of modern culture. She can’t quite make the inhuman sound human—or vice versa, for that matter. Still, at a time when rock'n'roll’s influence is waning, Ray’s defiant humor is a welcome and bracing change of pace. <i>Savage</i> plays like a middle finger flown in the face of long-cherished conventions, or perhaps that monkey-avatar flinging its own poop at not-so-innocent bystanders.</p></div>"|20562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20562-last-years-savage/|7.0|Stephen M.

""It’s funny, but it’s not funny. It’s there. But it’s great to have enough of a connection with that mentality where you can interact with it and poke your finger in it a little."" That joker’s soul, that urge to poke, can be traced through all of Faith No More's biggest moments, from their stunning hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG_k5CSYKhg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Epic""</a> to their genre-defying, commercially unsuccessful (and critically acclaimed) 1992 opus <i>Angel Dust</i>. From the early 1980s through 1997, Faith No More were the reputable carneys, sporting an array of influences and oddities: everything from <i>Madame Butterfly</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>, to Nietzsche and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a>, and even a not-yet-dead fish. And then they went away. </p>
<p class=""p1"">For the past 18 years, fans have waited patiently for Faith No More to wrap up a disappearing act that was the inevitable result of exhaustion, creative differences, and branching paths. Since that time, frontman Mike Patton started his <a href=""http://ipecac.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ipecac</a> label and pursued numerous solo projects, from the poppy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4899-peeping-tom/"">Peeping Tom</a> to the experimental supergroup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1451-fantomas"">Fantômas</a> to the style-swapping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4257-tomahawk/"">Tomahawk</a>. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum, the group's musical brain, started the bubblegum band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2092-imperial-teen/"">Imperial Teen</a>, scored films, and penned an opera about Bigfoot; meanwhile, bassist Billy Gould started <a href=""http://koolarrow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Koolarrow Records</a>, and drummer Mike Bordin manned the kit for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3180-ozzy-osbourne/"">Ozzy Osbourne</a>. In 2009, the group stirred from its slumber and began performing again. And now, at long last, we’ve arrived at the confrontational <i>Sol Invictus</i>, the follow-up to 1997’s <i>Album of the Year</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Distance and time do <i>not </i>make the heart grow fonder, and two decades haven't softened Patton’s coal-black heart. He’s pissed off and proud of it, picking fights with just about anyone and anything. ""Superhero"" sees him spewing taunts at beloved authority figures, each syllable hitting with the percussive force of a slug to the jaw. ""Leader of man, get back in your cage,"" he sneers from atop Bottum’s majestic piano strata, a fool cracking his whip at a lowered God. The humiliations continue with ""Cone of Shame"", which imagines a wrongful lover in a state of depersonalization and animality, while ""Black Friday"" mocks anyone who’s set foot in a Target at 4 a.m. This commentary is far from subtle, but the ridiculousness is part of the experience, and you can’t help but smile at the return of one of rock’s great contrarians.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The success of Faith No More’s theatrical approach depends on their ability to organize motifs, riffs, shouts, and whimpers into cathartic musical structures. Most of the album’s songs follow a similar dramatic pattern, with the band bookending their frantic (and typically brief) climaxes with unsettlingly calm passages and plodding tempos. The unassumingly simple melodies in ""Sunny Side Up"" and ""Rise of the Fall"" are set-ups for the carefully-orchestrated rage that lay in wait, and when it hits right the contrast makes for a fascinating listen, especially on the venomous ""Cone of Shame"". But over the course of the album, especially during later songs like ""Black Friday"", ""Motherfucker"", and ""Matador"", the recycled dynamics begin to lose their force. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Set aside the negligible opening and closing tracks, and <i>Sol</i><i> Invictus</i> has just eight tracks spanning 34 minutes, an underwhelming running time considering how long Faith No More have been away. Such brevity could be overlooked if <i>Sol Invictus</i> was accompanied by a significant shift in the band’s sound, but many of these songs feel like retreads. ""Superhero"" and ""Separation Anxiety"", while enjoyable, bear the signatures of ""Epic"" and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8b88US-6ts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Midlife Crisis""</a>, with their loping piano lines and bloodthirsty rap incantations. Meanwhile, ""Black Friday"" and ""Sunny Side Up"" conjure up déjà vu of Patton’s side projects; ""Motherfucker"" could be a pumped up version of Tomahawk’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgSc3GavTc8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I.O.U""</a>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There’s nothing necessarily wrong with a band repeating itself. But because Faith No More have such a long history, and their members are responsible for music in a staggering array of styles, it's hard not to expect more, to wish that they might in some way top themselves, or at least change direction. Towards the end of ""Cone of Shame"", Patton admits, ""I’m only happy when I’m pissing you off."" Considering Faith No More’s history of confounding and confronting the listening public and the systems of order which influence it, such a statement could serve as the band’s motto. In that sense, maybe holding something back was the plan all along, and a future Faith No More record (one is <a href=""http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2015/05/06/faith-no-mores-roddy-bottum-on-the-new-record-and-not-sucking.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said to be</a> on the way) will have something more.</p></div>"|20339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20339-sol-invictus/|6.0|Zoe Camp

Clean leads and light, melodic vocals trickled into oceans of fuzz under song titles like <a href=""http://joannagruesome.bandcamp.com/track/wussy-void"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wussy Void""</a> and <a href=""http://joannagruesome.bandcamp.com/track/anti-parent-cowboy-killers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Anti-Parent Cowboy Killers""</a>. Two years later and they haven't evened out. <i>Peanut Butter</i> could have smoothed the Cardiff band's sound, finding the happy middle between their rough edges and sticky-sweet center. Instead, it pushes the group's music further out toward both extremes.</p>
<p><i>Weird Sister</i> flung a few deliberate curveballs, like the ""wrong"" chords that rocked <a href=""http://joannagruesome.bandcamp.com/track/madison-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Madison""</a> off its equilibrium. <i>Peanut Butter</i> is a tornado full of curveballs. At a slight 22 minutes, it bursts and buzzes, locking into patterns and then exploding out of them once you think you've figured them out. Joanna Gruesome is still partial to melody—the pop syrup flows freely after a quick hardcore fake-out at the beginning of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17325-joanna-gruesome-last-year/"">""Last Year""</a>—but the hooks have lost their primacy inside the band's rough collage. The most interesting parts are now the serrated edges, the way textures brush up against textures, and how unstable the whole freewheeling machine can get.</p>
<p>On ""Last Year"" and the aggro-peppy ""Honestly Do Yr Worst"", singer Alanna McArdle snaps out of her light, breathy melodies to find a rhythmic kinship with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31732-perfect-pussy/"">Perfect Pussy</a>'s Meredith Graves. Those choking, biting yelps reveal exhausted phrases here and there, snippets of language like ""I am running on empty."" A song called ""I Don't Wanna Relax"" opens with 12 seconds of blast beats and dilapidated guitar chords. When guitarist and lead songwriter Owen Williams slashes ""There Is No Function Stacy"" sideways with noise-punk breakdowns, it's as if we're getting a glimpse of what exactly McArdle is trying to outrun.</p>
<p><span>Between the bright riffs and the squalls of feedback, a deep instability rests at Joanna Gruesome's core. There's more than just anger in their screams and the quick slams of the bass drum; there's a nervousness too, a sense that anything you could ever hold on to is always on the verge of slipping away. ""I know that life would be alright if I hadn't met you,"" Williams and McArdle sing on ""Separate Bedrooms"", as if seeing into a parallel universe and preemptively trying to reconcile the loss. Even the sub-two-minute tracks, like ""Jerome (Liar)"", seem to argue with themselves, switching modes from ""everything is fine"" to ""nothing will ever be okay again"" in the blink of an eye. </span></p>
<p><span>Joanna Gruesome combust to keep the world from freezing shut around them. <i>Peanut Butter</i> is a chaotic listen, powerful in parts and fragile in others, and often both at the same time. No matter where it goes, it's always running away from itself.</span></p></div>"|20533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20533-peanut-butter/|7.2|Sasha Geffen

You have to recalibrate your imagination when listening to Taylor performing at top speed, the better to make sense of how much music can be made by one person in a single moment. That those note-rich passages routinely add up to unbroken hour-long performances is what makes Taylor seem like the Everest of American music.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Precisely because his technique is so potent, critical reaction to Taylor's music usually breaks down into two camps: those who feel the big climb is worth it, and those who don’t. Miles Davis famously walked out of an early Taylor gig in New York. When asked by a 1990s PBS<a href=""http://www-tc.pbs.org/jazz/about/pdfs/MarsalisB.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> documentary crew</a> about Taylor’s suggestion that audiences should ""prepare"" for his concerts, saxophonist Branford Marsalis dismissed the concept out of hand. But elite opinion has shifted in recent years. A rising vanguard of pianists, led by the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28455-vijay-iyer-trio/"">Vijay Iyer</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4349-craig-taborn/"">Craig Taborn</a>, is not shy about praising Taylor’s extreme, often atonal style as a crucial part of the jazz tradition. This advocacy harkens back to the '60s work of African-American poet-critics like Amiri Baraka and A. B. Spellman, both of whom wrote about Taylor’s abstracted connection to the blues as much as they emphasized the pianist’s classical, conservatory training.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">This recent shift in perception of Taylor's work has been helped along by two significant reissue projects. The first is a fresh and deeply clarifying remaster of Taylor’s seminal 1966 group album <i>Unit Structures </i>(reissued on vinyl and in a <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/unit-structures/id797759986"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""mastered for iTunes"" edition</a> as part of the <a href=""http://www.bluenote.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blue Note</a> label’s ongoing 75th anniversary celebration). With this title, Taylor made explicit his idiosyncratic break with previous jazz practices. Instead of charts written out in standard notation, the structure of these compositions was based on sequences of themes, many of which were communicated and rehearsed orally. (Other bits of Taylor’s music might be notated in small snatches, or else delivered to the band live, during Taylor’s feverish piano improvisations.) That Taylor was working with an exploded conception of ""ensemble togetherness"" was indicated by one excerpt from a lengthy bit of free-verse poetry that served as the original LP’s liner notes: ""Time seen not as beats to be measured after academy’s podium angle."" In other words: <i>buckle up</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">After <i>Unit Structures</i>, Taylor cut one more LP for Blue Note, <i>Conquistador! </i>(also reissued by Blue Note this year). Then the pianist fell into a seven-year recording hiatus. During this period, it was possible for fans to look back at the ""we’re concerned for Cecil’s future"" tone of those '60s music-journalism pieces by Baraka and Spellman and concede that these writers had correctly foreseen a challenging period ahead. When Taylor popped back up, in the '70s, it was often as a solo artist touring in Europe. And, over the ensuing decades, it has been the interest (and respect) that Taylor has received from foreign promoters, crowds, and artists which has contributed mightily to the cause of keeping him afloat, and at work on his art.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The most lavish European tribute Taylor has ever received came in the form of a month-long residency in West Berlin, in 1988, which afforded him time to perform in all of his guises—as a solo visionary, as a telepathic improviser playing next to a wide variety of top-shelf duo partners, and also as a big-band and orchestra leader. The results were recorded, and released as <i>In Berlin '88<a href=""http://destination-out.bandcamp.com/album/the-complete-in-berlin-88-box-set"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></i>, an 11-CD box set from the Free Music Production label. Longtime <i>Village Voice</i> critic Gary Giddins wrote that ""Cecil Taylor’s Berlin adventure represents his finest achievement."" Then the set promptly went out of print. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Thanks to <a href=""http://destination-out.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Destination: OUT</a>, the mp3 blog turned Bandcamp reissue-label, the whole set is <a href=""http://destination-out.bandcamp.com/album/the-complete-in-berlin-88-box-set"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">now available</a> as a high-quality, authorized download, complete with two additional discs of solo works Taylor recorded on the other side of the Iron Curtain in '88. The whole package is now titled <i>The Complete Cecil Taylor in Berlin ’88</i>, and while it’s an investment ($125 for over 14 hours of music), it’s the other iconic reissue event that makes 2015 a prime year for approaching Taylor. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The first disc in this set,<i> Legba Crossing</i>, presents the Cecil Taylor Workshop Ensemble, which the bandleader had time to instruct in his idiosyncratic compositional/rehearsal system. There are passages of collective squall here, but in its best moments, you can hear a sense of dawning discovery, as subsections of the group try out Taylor’s serpentine motifs and steadily gain control over them before individual players dare to contribute fluttering improvisations. The takeaway here is that, in contrast with his often lighting-fast pianist playing, Taylor the chamber-music composer has a taste for long, sustained tones, which might entice fans of drone artists like<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18967-david-first-electronic-works-1976-1977/""> David First</a> (who actually spent some time playing in one of Taylor’s early '70s groups).</p>
<p class=""p1"">The next five discs in the Berlin box are all piano-and-percussion duets (each with a different drummer). Here’s where you get several metric tons of Taylor at the piano. On these sets, Taylor is by turns raging and lyrical, though always confident. And the drummers bring out different aspects of his playing. He meets the shrapnel-distributing heaviness of Günter Sommer with similar intensity, on the box’s second disc (<i>Riobec</i>). On <i>Regalia</i>, the occasionally Latin-tinged work of Paul Lovens brings out an interesting restraint. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Another attraction of the <i>Berlin</i> box is the double-album <i>Alms / Tiergarten (Spree)</i>, recorded by the Cecil Taylor European Orchestra. It’s a major addition to Taylor’s in-print catalog. Behaving less like an orchestra and more like a big band outfitted with famous names from Europe’s avant-garde improv scene (such as Peter Brötzmann and Evan Parker), the group is capable of high-energy blowouts. But like Taylor’s Workshop Ensemble, they play his quieter music with authority, too. Album number nine in this set, <i>The Hearth</i>, takes the cellist Tristan Honsinger and saxophonist Parker, both members of the European Orchestra, and places them in an instrumental trio setting that I don’t believe is duplicated anywhere else in Taylor’s discography.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The most divisive album from the original box set follows: <i>Pleistozaen Mit Wasser</i>, which pairs Taylor up with the late British scrape-guitar pioneer Derek Bailey. The first half-hour track features very little piano playing from Taylor: He starts out by accompanying Bailey’s free-improv plucks with poetry (and then various inside-the-piano rubbings). It’s not a disaster, but given the historic meeting between iconic experimenters, it feels underwhelming. Things improve on the second half-hour cut: a stretch of quietly metallic avant-garde music that avoids sounding like well-behaved children sorting the recycling. The richness of the piano (even with Taylor pedaling the mute) contrasts winningly with the dry sound that Bailey coaxes from his electric guitar. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The finale from the original box set, <i>Erzulie Maketh Scent</i>, is a solo marathon, broadly similar to other such Taylor records from the '70s onward. And the double-album bonus release, <i>In East Berlin, </i>is split between piano solos and another Taylor hookup with drummer Günter Sommer (who seems less intent on out-walloping Taylor, this time around). Neither East Berlin set trumps the highlights from the original West Berlin box, but hey—as long as you’re paying real money, they’re nice to have.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Speaking of consumer considerations, there is the inevitable question as to whether this box set, important as it is, makes for a ""good place to start with Cecil."" The answer is no. You should start with some early Taylor albums first, if only to get a clearer look at his connection to jazz’s past.

A genteel folk shuffle cedes to a gnarly blues moan, or a ragtime ditty yields to an extended raga improvisation. Maybe there’s a banjo number, a fiddle tune, or a collage of field-recording abstraction, where crickets chirp or creeks trickle beneath incidental chords. This condition has seemed especially true for the large group of players that has emerged during the last decade. As though to keep stride with our genre-blending times, and to not be bound by old stylistic structures, these young instrumentalists (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31339-steve-gunn/"">Steve Gunn</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/629-james-blackshaw/"">James Blackshaw</a> among them) have often embraced adaptability more than singularity. </p>
<p>Daniel Bachman has spent the bulk of the six albums he’s released during the last four years showing that, even at the age of 25, he can stretch. For 2013’s <i>Jesus I’m a Sinner</i>, he<i> </i>plucked a banjo on one track, picked meditative lines through a haze of eerie effects for the next, and then pranced and plowed alongside an old-time band. There have been little one-instrument symphonies and unadorned folk beauties, irascible strummers and blissful drifters. The variety has made for wonderful discrete moments and galvanized Bachman’s growing reputation as one of his form’s best new practitioners. But it’s also made for albums that were mostly fine—often dazzling but generally distracted, as if Bachman knew how to travel but not exactly where to go. <i>River</i>, Bachman’s seventh album, is the first with a clear purpose and consistent direction. To date, it’s the best work of his career.</p>
<p>Though Bachman is now based in Durham, N.C., where <i>River </i>was recorded, he is a native of the northern Virginia city of Fredericksburg, near where the Rappahannock River winds out of the Chesapeake Bay. A set of seven unaccompanied guitar instrumentals, <i>River</i> reads like a private love letter to an old home, written and sent from a new one. Named for another nearby town, the short ""Farnham"" is nostalgic but sentimentally vague, like a winsome feeling in search of the exact childhood memory that inspired it. The two-part, 17-minute suite ""Song for the Setting Sun"" conjures an array of emotions in one fluid listen. In part one, Bachman seems to express anxiety over the disappearing day in a place he loves but must leave; just before the three-minute mark, you can hear him nervously shuffle in his chair, perhaps even sigh. The nerves soon sublimate into contentment, though, as Bachman plays the sort of bright, gentle melody that suggests a hand-me-down folk standard, a musical home remedy meant to quell unease. At one point, Bachman’s busy, bustling strings imply he’s even throwing a backyard party. This material is like a survey of his experiences, not an overview of his abilities.</p>
<p><i>River</i> runs so well as a unit that, unless you’re able to spot the tunes or sleuth the liner notes, you likely won’t detect that Bachman didn’t even write two of these numbers. Bachman undercuts the original sliver of menace in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgHMtw8duMQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jack Rose’s ""Levee""</a>, turning what sounds like an ominous threat into a hopeful promise. His chords glow, and his pulse is quick, as if he’s reflecting on a hard place from a safe, removed distance. The same holds for his spry interpretation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZDgMi2YGhA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">William Moore’s patient, playful 1928 delight, ""Old Country Rock""</a>. Bachman fills the spaces between Moore’s licks with brief notes and radiant overtones; he’s practically dancing with the source material. Though divided by nearly a century, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Kei6vAXAY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rose and Moore both lived</a> in the riverine area Bachman extols here; Rose grew up in Fredericksburg, and <a href=""http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/rootsmusic/piedmont.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moore used to cross the Rappahannock for work. </a>Bachman treats their tales with the same familiarity and fondness he treats the land and his own life there.</p>
<p>The Rappahannock is Bachman’s thematic thread, an animating and unifying concept that helps all of this material work as a set piece, not just a set of pieces. If he wants to keep his albums interesting, of course, it’s unlikely he’ll return to the same geographical feature often. But maybe that’s not necessary now. During the 14-minute opener ""Won’t You Cross Over to that Other Shore"", it’s clear something has shifted with Bachman’s composition and execution. There’s a little bit of raga and a little bit of ragtime, some rock'n'roll gusto and some bluegrass spirit. But all these elements feel connected and cohesive, like bits moving together with perfectly governed momentum. Even when the song swings from its darkest, slowest drags to its shiniest, fastest flourishes, the results feel more personal than professional, a demonstration of experience rather than education.</p></div>"|20433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20433-river/|7.7|Grayson Haver Currin

You can get a sense of the circles Ricci has inhabited from <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Various-State-Of-The-Union/release/1153614"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 1982 compilation</a> on which he features alongside John Lurie, Peter Blegvad, Arto Lindsay, Christian Marclay, Martin Bisi, and Spalding Gray, among other Downtown N.Y. fixtures. If you don't pay close attention to New York's independent theater and new-music scenes, you may never have heard of Ricci, but he is a cult figure to some. An Amsterdam label that specializes in reissues of overlooked electronic musicians, like the Italian ambient outsider Gigi Masin and the Balearic oddball Joan Bibiloni, named itself after Ricci's 1985 album <i>Music From Memory</i>. (The LP's fans are a dedicated bunch: a batch of deadstock copies recently sold out at <a href=""http://invisiblecityeditions.bigcartel.com/product/vito-ricci-music-from-memory"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">$85 a pop</a>.) Now, <a href=""http://musicfrommemory.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Music From Memory</a> is paying back the debt with a collection of Ricci's work.</p>
<p>Most of it is drawn from the 1980s, rescued from tapes made for theater works by playwrights like Matthew Maguire, Jeffrey M. Jones, and Susan Mosakowski. There are plangent synthesizers and gently pealing guitars; there are chiming echoes of classical minimalism and even synthetic strings descended from the vernacular heritage of Charles Ives. ""Hollywood"" sounds every bit like the incidental music its title would suggest, with its limpid synth pads and ersatz jazz keyboards; the slap-bass-infused ""Dub It"" doesn't have much to do with reggae, though it's certainly indicative of how what we might call ""rainforest noir"" ruled cinematic imaginations in the '80s.</p>
<p>As electronic music goes, it's a hard-to-place sound, lacking in the usual stylistic signifiers and now-canonical instruments. (The album notes detail a gear list of mostly forgotten devices like the Octave Plateau Voyetra 8 synthesizer, E-mu Proteus sound module, and Yamaha RX11 drum machine.) The music here sometimes brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31665-craig-leon/"">Craig Leon</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18553-craig-leon-nommos/""><i>Nommos</i></a> and the early '80s recordings of the Seattle ambient musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32250-k-leimer/"">K. Leimer</a>. It shares, at least in part, their technology—long-since outmoded synthesizers, unvarnished drum machines, springy delay that wreathes the music with a hint of fizz—and their aesthetics, a mixture of proto-ambient, late-night television soundtracks, and homebrewed avant-gardism. Both of those artists released electronic music that sounded completely otherworldly in the '80s, and both, like Ricci, have recently been rediscovered, via reissues like this one.</p>
<p>In that sense, the compilation says as much about what listeners find value in now as it does the lasting value of the music itself. Today, sounds that even five years ago might have seemed unfashionable suddenly sound fresh. That's not to take away from Ricci's accomplishments: much of <i>I Was Crossing a Bridge</i> is wonderful stuff, even the incidental bits. One of the highlights is ""Commie Stories (Part 9)"", one of a pair of sketches written for Susan Mosakowski's play of the same name. Less than two minutes long, it consists of a single arpeggio played—by hand, from the sound of it—through a delay unit, evoking a burbling water fountain; it's easy to imagine it as the foundation for a transporting techno jam on a label like <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L.I.E.S.</a> or <a href=""http://www.thetrilogytapes.com/ttt/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Trilogy Tapes</a>. And if ""Inferno (Part 1)"", an eight-and-a-half-minute fugue for shuddering percussion and chirping analog delay, were released on either of those labels today, passed off as a new production from a bedroom studio in Los Angeles or Berlin, nobody would bat an eye. That the opening track, ""The Ship Was Sailing"", sounds like a companion piece to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRZi30Wb0Zw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maxmillion Dunbar's ""Woo""</a>, from the <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/117386-Future-Times"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future Times</a> co-founder's 2013 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17698-maxmillion-dunbar-house-of-woo/""><i>House of Woo</i></a>, speaks to the uncanny timeliness of Ricci's work. It's as though gardens planted in vacant lots in the '80s, long left untended, were finally being harvested, and their heirloom seeds put back into circulation.</p>
<p>Two songs on the anthology date from the past few years, and they are, perhaps appropriately, among the album's most musically and conceptually developed selections. ""Deep Felt Music"", nearly 13 minutes long, evokes both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"">Durutti Column</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/816-tony-conrad/"">Tony Conrad</a> in its flickering hints of plucked guitar and its shimmering drones, while ""Dox E Koo"", for solo voice and delay, stakes out a position somewhere between Meredith Monk and the haunting tones of <i>Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares</i>. The very finest piece is ""Riverflow (Electronic)"". Plucked acoustic guitar cuts against coolly bowed lines and dissolves into a galaxy of delay and faint percussion; dissonant and arrhythmic, it could almost be mistaken for a Gastr Del Sol outtake. No date is given in the album notes, so I don't know when it was recorded. There's a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQjQ8SXFndg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">different version</a> on YouTube, dated 1970, but the album version, sparklier and in much higher fidelity, is almost certainly a more recent recording. But perhaps it doesn't really matter when it was made. The best material on this compilation sounds like it stands outside of time entirely. Unlike linear time, this river flows both ways.</p></div>"|20548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20548-i-was-crossing-a-bridge/|6.8|Philip Sherburne

There’s both weirdness and toughness in droves on his debut album-cum-deliverance, <i>Ratchet</i>. Less than two years after sending a demo cross-country to Brooklyn's <a href=""http://entergodmode.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Godmode</a> imprint, Shamir signed to <a href=""http://www.xlrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">XL Recordings</a>—a label known for pop outliers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1096-dizzee-rascal/"">Dizzee Rascal</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>—and got his face on <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/img/bp/shamir-billboard.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Times Square billboard</a>. On <i>Ratchet</i>, an honest, earnest pop record, Shamir elaborates on the gutsy melodies of those early demos and singles and makes good on the hype.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Produced entirely by Godmode label head Nick Sylvester (a former Pitchfork contributor), <i>Ratchet</i> feels like a study in the best dance-pop of the past decade, from the dank basslines of the Ed Banger collective to the melodic, moody prance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>, the flamboyance of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4063-scissor-sisters/"">Scissor Sisters</a> to the technical, four-on-the-floor finesse of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29053-azari-iii/"">Azari &amp; III</a>. This powers a record that’s about the sine wave of adolescent emotions; Shamir, a cherub-faced fashion kid with a voice like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Waters"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Waters</a>, flips easily between confidence and vulnerability. The piano house/diva vocal-influenced R&amp;B track <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK0daD853Do"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Know It’s a Good Thing""</a>, from last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19425-shamir-northtown-ep/""><i>Northtown</i> EP</a>, merely hinted at how dance-indebted this record is. Acid basslines chug and squelch on ""Call It Off"" and ""Hot Mess"", and ""Make a Scene"" and ""Head in the Clouds"" both ascend to frenzied, laser synth peaks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">House, particularly within the context of its early black, gay roots, has been described as liberating. There’s a freedom narrative at play on <i>Ratchet</i> too, as Shamir excises those childhood demons while calling upon the showy, campy glamor of his hometown. ""Vegas, we’re sinners all right, at least at night,"" Shamir warbles on the lounge-y intro track, named after the city. Shamir's voice is the most immediately unusual element; whether singing or rapping, he moves from comely to coy to cocky, depending on what the song calls for. Like on ""Youth"", a nu-disco lament with a soulful breakdown, where he pours his tinsel voice over a double-time rattle and a Morse-quick buzz synth. Each word trickles out slowly and precise at first, and then it’s like he backs away from the mic to sing from the gut, trilling and ad-libbing to a rapturous breakdown.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Squint past his vocal brass and the dazzle of the production and there’s that weirdness and toughness. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17194-shamir-on-the-regular/"">""On the Regular""</a>, a gleaming, dance-rap contagion, is the kitschy lure into the album, more subdued than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"">Azealia Banks</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12612-212/"">""212""</a> but sharing a spiritual bounce and temerity. ""Don’t try me, I’m not a free sample...Haters get the bird, more like the eagle,"" he alternates between a regal, almost sensual moan and breathless rapping, which dilutes the crassness of alluding to dropping down and thrusting his crotch in someone’s face. And on the wry ballad ""Demon"", about a life-altering relationship, ""If I'm a demon, baby, you're the beast that made me."" It’s a beautiful, delicate melody that’s slightly blue, and brings Shamir as close as he’ll get to straight up vulnerability on a pulsing, in-your-face record. Perhaps most indicative of <i>Ratchet</i>’s pseudo-redemptive, leaving-Las-Vegas arc is ""In for the Kill"", an orchestral freak-out that finds Shamir looking back to say, ""I’ll be back someday, and when I do I promise you, I won’t make the same mistake."" The adult Shamir has reconstituted his precious voice as armor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He might resemble past baby-faced rap and R&amp;B stars like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IMx</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBTBT"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TBTBT</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2K"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">B2K</a>, minus the hyper-alpha masculinity, but Shamir fits in with today’s genre-bending pop stars. <i>Ratchet</i> is as melodically and thematically confident as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Smith"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Willow Smith</a>, but his aesthetic—a Vegas pixie, a black man making poetic and flagrantly rococo dance pop—is a challenge and a reclamation, not just of ""ratchet,"" but the queer, racialized roots of house music and the unabashedly flamboyant history of black pop music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We revere <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> and are <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/05/13/leave-young-thug-alone"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fascinated by Young Thug</a>, both unapologetically outre musicians walking the line of black masculinity, but they qualify that with reams of virile, hetero fuck-anthems. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a> came out and said it. Shamir, on the other hand, conveys a more ambiguous sensuality that presents a challenge to pop—his lane, for sure—especially given his soft, high-pitched, luminous voice. He doesn’t tell us anything about his sexuality, but we all know how people can treat artistic, effete boys. What <i>Ratchet</i>’s 10 songs of self-discovery say without saying at all is that there’s liberation on the dancefloor.</p></div>"|20585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20585-ratchet/|8.3|Anupa Mistry

But truly meditative music isn't so much sedative as it is transformative, inducing a deliberately slower, quieter mental state. That's the kind of meditation Haley Fohr encourages as Circuit Des Yeux, and never more so than on </span><i>In Plain Speech</i><span>. The album is all long arcs and patient development. It's not laid-back; much of it is urgent and dramatically tense. Fohr's not here to placate, but she does seem bent on getting you to step back, to hear things calmly rather than in a rush.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If that sounds more like a task than a pleasure, don't worry: Fohr does most of the work for you. Her songs escort you toward stillness and awe rather than requiring you to get there first. The music is immediate and enveloping, and because of her rich, stirring voice, it's sometimes even bracing. But once you're ensnared, it becomes quietly mesmerizing. Part of that comes from the way she builds songs, adding pieces and textures subtly over time. But much of </span><i>In Plain Speech</i><span>'s meditative power is a product of the wholeness and commitment of Fohr's vision, which communicates itself on a more intuitive level.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Often her approach is refreshingly simple: to make you pause, Fohr pauses herself. In ""Do the Dishes"", after a stretched-out haiku moaned over a cycling sample, she retreats into complete silence, then re-emerges with long, wordless tones. A similar full stop comes after the folk-rock climax of ""Fantasize the Scene"", as Fohr appends a string-heavy epilogue that evokes the best dirges of </span><span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Though it doesn't contain a literal pause, ""A Story of This World"" is </span><i>In Plain Speech</i><span>'s most stillness-inducing track, and its best. On the surface, it's a simple folk tune, with acoustic strums, gentle strings, and Fohr's koans about how ""all the gold turns to rust."" But the tune's primal patience—its willingness to hang in space as it moves, to stand rather than sprint—is so thorough it feels like nature. Here and in the slow-burning instrumental ""Dream of TV"", Circuit Des Yeux recalls the </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/""><span>Dirty Three</span></a><span>, the way they grow a tune so organically it feels more like weather than music—and the way they tease out powerful emotions without triggering easy sentimentality.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Past Circuit Des Yeux albums flirted with the maudlin, but </span><i>In Plain Speech</i><span> feels brighter and more optimistic; the music seems to be continually rising. Where she was once introspective, Fohr is now interested in human connection, using second and third person more than first. ""Do you roam for the end?/ Do you roam to transcend?"" she asks beatifically in ""</span><span>Ride Blind""</span><span>. Later, ""</span><span>Fantasize the Scene""</span><span> dreams of eternal companionship: ""I know a place where we could go/ Maybe I will meet you there/ In a world where we'll go all the way.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The optimism of </span><i>In Plain Speech </i><span>still comes with plenty of heavy drama, especially in Fohr's harrowing singing. Dark, thick, and nearly scraping baritone, her voice is so strikingly different —and so unafraid to skirt melodrama—that you can never quite get comfortable with it. But that uniqueness is part of what makes her music so compelling, as is her willingness to drift into wordless sounds—perhaps her recent experience using her voice as an instrument in </span><a href=""http://mindovermirrors.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Mind Over Mirrors</span></a><span> was an influence.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Part of</span><span><i> In Plain Speech</i>'</span><span>s relative sunniness comes from Fohr's embrace of collaborators. She went it alone on previous albums, and the music was accordingly intimate and confined. Here, with the help of some Chicago neighbors—including Cooper Crain (</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27151-cave/""><span>Cave</span></a><span>,</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31611-bitchin-bajas/""><span> Bitchin Bajas</span></a><span>), Rob Frye (Bitchin Bajas), and Kathleen Baird (</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4131-spires-that-in-the-sunset-rise/""><span>Spires That in the Sunset Rise</span></a><span>)—her music opens up and spreads out, incorporating more percussion and strings. Fohr's voice remains central, but these partnerships have added new verve to her music.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That openness to collaboration dovetails with Fohr's framing of <i>In Plain Speech </i>as an outward-looking album. As she recently <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/news/circuit-des-yeux-announces-in-plain-speech"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">put it</a>, ""This record is me putting out my hand and asking the world to grab onto it."" That may seem to contradict the idea of this music as meditative, but it actually fits quite well. Where previous records offered a portal into Fohr's own inner space, <i>In Plain Speech </i>is about altering her listeners' perceptions, and taking them somewhere new.</p></div>"|20464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20464-in-plain-speech/|8.0|Marc Masters

Thin little riffs stopped mid-phrase; chords splintered, as if Connors had simply forgotten he was playing them. Background noise cycled through the recording. At first blush, Connors' music can sound casual and even errant, the practice reels of someone learning to play.</p>
<p>But stay with it, and the internal logic of Connors' work becomes evident. Rather than mimic the blues of his forebears and heroes, he splits their style open and reorders the elements. In doing so, he can weep with his guitar, moan, exclaim and even stare (almost silently) into the middle distance. To that end, the newly resurrected <i>Blues: The ""Dark Paintings"" of Mark Rothko</i> is one of the more revelatory sets of Connors' career, one that finds him vocalizing through six electrified strings and adds another emotional sphere to his repertoire.</p>
<p>The restored and remastered edition from <a href=""http://family-vineyard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Family Vineyard</a>—an imprint that's done essential work in both <a href=""http://family-vineyard.com/products/night-through-singles-collected-works-1976-2004"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">preserving</a> and pushing Connors' legacy <a href=""http://family-vineyard.com/products/the-lost-mariner"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">since its second release, in 1999</a>—almost doesn't qualify as a reissue. Sure, it has all the trappings, like a new cover (one of Rothko's ""dark paintings,"" in fact), new liner notes, and archival addendums that include the original liner notes. But <i>Dark Paintings</i> was barely issued, anyway. Connors originally released it<i> </i>in 1990, under the short-lived named ""Guitar Roberts"" and on his own label, St. Joan Records, in a hand-made edition of between 200 and 300. For years, its seven tracks have existed mostly as a phantom, something you pilfered from an MP3 blog or heard about<i> </i>rather than heard. At last, however, one of the best documents from an essential, transitional phase of Connors' career is widely available. It's another chance to hear more of him and to understand his quiet intensity.</p>
<p>""Blues No. 4"", for instance, begins with a frail melody, Connors stepping up and down across the neck. He applies the same pattern across the instrument's range, high notes that nearly squeal countering low ones that sulk. He stretches some into rock'n'roll leads but mostly lets the notes circle around one another, allowing for variations so slight you barely notice. The music's relative simplicity highlights his vibrato, or the way that the whole piece seems to wobble in time. Using only an electric guitar and a four-track recorder, Connors conjures the essence of a battered old 78, a song spit out by the horn of a hulking Victrola. Connors sings these blues with his fingers.<b> </b></p>
<p>Likewise, during ""No. 6"", Connors sounds alternately like an opera singer <i>and</i> Bessie Smith, with the soprano pleas of his guitar's upper register cutting against a blanket rumble of low notes. Dense tangles unwind into long threads for ""No. 2"". Each time, it's as if you can hear him sigh beneath some heavy burden, like Robert Johnson lamenting <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QazkS_pI-ig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the last fair deal</a> or Geeshie Wiley remembering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAKfy2W70Qg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">those last kind words</a>. These seven instrumentals represent Connors' responses to a <a href=""http://pace-production.s3.amazonaws.com/file_objects/old_pace_pdfs/45171/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">posthumous exhibition</a> of the <a href=""http://www.pacegallery.com/newyork/exhibitions/12270/mark-rothko-the-dark-paintings-1969-1970"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dark Paintings"" of Mark Rothko,</a> a major ideological and technical influence he's long acknowledged. Rothko finished these works just before committing suicide in 1970. Connors' responses, then, seem like an attempt to live among those same bleak grays and blacks but to not languish in them—that is, to survive by singing about the sadness, not drowning in it. The anguish so apparent in the hand-wringing chords of ""No. 1"" sublimate into a kind of contemplative beauty by the end of ""No. 7"".</p>
<p>When I recently revisited <i>Dark Paintings</i>, I heard in Connors' work an unintentional and contemporary connection I'd never imagined: These seven songs use instrumental guitar to produce the same immersive effect as recent electronic work by the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"">Andy Stott</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/"">Zomby</a>. You yield to the feeling of it all as much as the technical form or finesse, however accomplished that might be. And you depend on the glimpses of light—the gentle melodies, the sudden shouts—that creep through the void. Though <i>Dark Paintings</i> lasts only 29 minutes, it's work that's worth hearing on repeat for hours, as if you live inside these sounds. The meticulous, counterintuitive logic comes into slow focus, and perseverance engrained in these reflections starts to become clear. Rather than succumb to the blues, Connors and his guitar get them out the best way they know how.</p></div>"|20305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20305-blues-the-dark-paintings-of-mark-rothko/|8.3|Grayson Haver Currin

In addition to his role as a guitarist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a> alongside twin brother <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7136-aaron-dessner/"">Aaron</a>, he has a solo album of orchestral work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1819-jonny-greenwood/"">Jonny Greenwood</a>; he's written and recorded pieces for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6375-kronos-quartet/"">Kronos Quartet</a>; he's curated Cincinnati’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58854-the-national-perform-with-the-cincinnati-symphony-orchestra-at-musicnow-festival/"">weirdest festival</a>; he participated in the hyper-collaborative  work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35505-the-national-breeders-my-brightest-diamond-team-up-for-multimedia-piece/"">""The Long Count""</a> for the Brooklyn Academy of Music. As for his day job, he's sneaky about his influences: Strings might not regularly grace the National's music, but Dessner's simple repetitions often recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>'s <i>Electric Counterpoint</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/730-rhys-chatham/"">Rhys Chatham</a>'s ""Guitar Trio"". On his sophomore solo release, <i>Music for Wood and Strings</i>, he aims to blur the boundaries separating his two chosen genres by literally inventing a new instrument.</p>
<p>In an ambitious move, Bryce Dessner co-designed something called a Chordstick with Aron Sanchez of freak-folk duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30394-buke-and-gase/"">Buke and Gase</a>. Their creation is a hammer dulcimer and electric guitar hybrid, combining taut strings with sanded wood and metal fixtures. The instrument only plays two chords, but it's written in a way that dense contrapuntal rhythms—two melodic lines dancing simultaneously without touching—can switch between eight different sets of strings. The resulting sound is complex. It’s thin and full, sharp and malleable, hazy and clear. Brooklyn quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5003-so-percussion/"">Sō Percussion</a> employ four of these Chordsticks with remarkable precision in Dessner’s post-minimalism piece, and the sound is the sonic equivalent of WALL·E and EVE <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRHBmOSbEtM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dancing in space</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Music for Wood and Strings</i> uses repetition as its canvas. The open space between notes throughout the 10 ""tracks""—the tracklist sections off the piece by style, but the album is continuous—encourages contemplation the same way post-rock bands do. It requires repeat listens, which, given the end ""song"" is a reprise of the 35-minute piece as a whole, comes naturally. The use of mirrored inversions within chords and complex rhythms lends the piece an almost instructional quality, as if it’s teaching you quietly how to listen to it. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27568-david-lang/"">David Lang</a>'s <i>The So-Called Laws of Nature,</i> it creates its own sound world.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dessner chooses a layering of rich tones inspired by the open chords of American folk songs, a deliberate change from the intensity of his debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18702-bryce-dessner-aheym-by-kronos-quartet/"">Aheym</a></i>. It begins with elongated whole notes peppered by joyful sixteenths, plucking their way through what sounds like a cave walled with blossoming wildflowers. Later, one Chordstick impersonates a spa-like gong and the others tremor like bugs buzzing near the speaker. In ""Section 4"" and""Section 6"", the bass string is plucked with the warmth of a cello. Occasionally a snare drum pops up, but it stays muted in comparison to the strings.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The true beauty of <i>Music for Wood and Strings</i> stems from the enrollment of percussionists, not guitarists, to play these four parts, something that's a little lost in the translation here. Without visual aids, much of the joyful physicality of the performance is gone. Visually, the instruments look like two guitars laid flat beside each other. Sō Percussion don't use hammers to hit the strings. Instead, the players use #2 pencils to tap them like a xylophone, chipping the yellow paint off and creating indents that look like bite marks. Then, of course, come the bows, stretched across the strings and quickly sawed against the highest frets for a trill. Occasionally, the players stretch their thumbs flat against the bridge, pushing down on the strings the way you gently squish an ant on the kitchen counter, creating a muted note. It’s mesmerizing post-minimalism, but in headphones it gets occasionally lost in its own hum. Between his orchestral, chamber, and vocal compositions, this one is Bryce Dessner’s most adventurous work, but its own reverb masks the very complexities it should boast.</p></div>"|20486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20486-music-for-wood-and-strings/|6.8|Nina Corcoran

I want to see what's next,"" Ben Khan sings on ""Drive, Pt. 1"", the last of four songs on last year's <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/benkhan/sets/1992ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>1992</i></a>, his debut EP. He's talking to a would-be paramour, but due to its location at the end of his first commercial release, the couplet functions equally as a sort of wink to listeners, an invitation to stick around as the enigmatic London producer figures out just what the second phase of his career looks like. Based on the four new songs on his latest EP, <i>1000</i>, the name of the game in phase two is refinement—and, in some ways, contraction—rather than expansion.</p>
<p>Comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28714-jai-paul/"">Jai Paul</a>'s warped brand of R&amp;B are a bit easy, but the two share more than just UK citizenship and a penchant for privacy. Like Paul, Khan favors woozy, blown-out sounds and a similar sample-based approach to his music. But Khan's subatomically-unstable electro-funk relies on his bluesy guitar playing—usually chopped into bite-sized chunks and woven into tracks in a collage-like fashion—just as much as it does his synthesizers. This marriage continues to evolve on <i>1000</i>. As evidenced on the EP's title track, there's a heavier reliance on guitar, which is allowed to unfurl over longer passages this time around. ""Red"" and ""Zenith"" tip their scales toward the second half of the electro-funk equation. Both tracks contain wandering guitar lines, and when Khan's two favored instruments lock in orbit around each other, the results are thrilling—for Khan, disorienting and intoxicating aren't entirely dissimilar.</p>
<p>But <i>1000</i> is more claustrophobic than <i>1992</i>. There's less empty space in these four songs, less room to breathe and stretch out. Whereas the songs on <i>1992</i> felt like they covered a lot of ground without rushing, the 10 minutes worth of music here carries a first-draft feeling that never quite dissipates. The narrower palette Khan employs only adds to the demo-like quality: ""2022 Zodiac"" doesn't even feature an entire verse before giving way to a few snippets of film dialogue and then abruptly ending.</p>
<p>Even Khan's songwriting feels like an afterthought: a 10-second stretch on ""Red"" finds him rhyming <i>bad</i> with <i>sad</i> and <i>lady</i> with <i>baby</i>, which should let you know just where his priorities on this EP lie. While it succeeds in terms of immediacy, <i>1000</i> makes less of a lasting impression than Khan's initial batch of music, cycling through ideas at a dizzying speed in an attempt to stuff it with hooks rather than identify its strongest ones.</p></div>"|20615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20615-1000-ep/|6.2|Renato Pagnani

His name on a record was an assurance of a certain level of quality, and he had his name on a great number of them. During these years, he engineered, produced, mixed, and played on records by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3843-smog/"">Smog</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3385-sam-prekop/"">Sam Prekop</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1467-faust/"">Faust</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"">John Fahey</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/816-tony-conrad/"">Tony Conrad</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> (of which he was a member), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3178-beth-orton/"">Beth Orton</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3998-superchunk/"">Superchunk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3038-phill-niblock/"">Phill Niblock</a>, and many more. In a suspiciously high number of cases, he was involved in one of those artists' best records.</p>
<p>We’ve heard so much about the abuses of digital technology over the last five years—the compression, the brick-walling, the poor mastering, the lack of dynamic range. Well, O’Rourke didn’t do that stuff; in fact, he defined himself against it (he’s never released his solo work on mp3 and, in fact, only <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/artists/jim-orourke"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">released his solo albums digitally</a> at all in the past month). The music he worked on didn’t necessarily surface on radio, but it sounded fantastic in your living room. Throughout the period just before and just after the millennium, no one better exemplified the promise of what was then called post-rock—music steeped in tradition that also looked beyond it, integrating traditional tools with new technologies and exploring new contexts. And then, on top of all that, there were Jim O’Rourke’s solo albums.</p>
<p>Starting with 1997’s <i>Bad Timing</i>, O’Rourke has released a series of what are usually called his ""pop"" albums on <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a>. Not all of these have vocals (<i>Bad Timing</i> focused on steel string guitar and whimsical Americana, while 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13468-the-visitor/""><i>The Visitor</i></a> is a difficult-to-classify proggy electro-acoustic instrumental suite), but O’Rourke’s Drag City solo records have threads running through them, from shared title inspirations to artwork to musical quotations from one album to the next. O’Rourke enjoys games and references and limitations that allow him to create a world where his music exists. Each album stands on its own but also feels like a brick in a slowly building wall. No two of O’Rourke’s solo albums sound alike; each exists in its own space. For <i>Simple Songs</i>, that space is firmly in the smart singer-songwriter world of the 1970s, the place where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8485-van-dyke-parks/"">Van Dyke Parks</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a> might be hanging out and drinking and telling dirty jokes.</p>
<p>When O’Rourke first sang on <i>Eureka</i>, his voice stuck out like a crumpled bag of Cheetos on Queen Elizabeth’s dinner table. Part of the charm of the music came from hearing a guy who could not sing gamely do so, voicing complicated melodies while surrounded by luxurious production. It made no sense and somehow, because of that, it worked. With <i>Simple Songs</i>, O’Rourke’s voice has deepened and become more gruff, and he sounds almost normal. There’s a timbral similarity here to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6660-cat-stevens/"">Cat Stevens</a>, though O’Rourke couldn’t have that kind of innocence and sweetness even if he wanted to. Instead, the lyrics are the usual mix of dark humor and misanthropy, with occasional glimpses of warmth. Album opener ""Friends With Benefits"" begins with ""Nice to see you once again,"" and it seems like he’s addressing it to listeners who haven’t heard from him in a while, but then he follows that with ""Been a long time my friends/ Since you crossed my mind at all."" O’Rourke’s songs are saying real things, but they are also constantly subverting themselves, in love with pop-lyric tradition while pushing against it. O’Rourke is the kind of songwriter who titles a closing song ""All Your Love"", but makes the chorus ""All your love/ Will never change me"" and then cuts that sentiment with ""I’m so happy now/ And I blame you.""</p>
<p>O’Rourke is always clever and funny, but the driving force in his music is the art of the arrangement. Many of the greatest pleasures on <i>Simple Songs</i> come from how certain instruments are layered together, how the chords are voiced and the harmonic progressions unfold. The songs, played by O’Rourke and a cast of Tokyo-based musicians, are generally driven by guitar and piano, but strings, pedal steel, mandolin, horns, and woodwinds are all featured prominently. There are gorgeous instrumental bridges and codas, like the one in ""Half Life Crisis"" that finds O’Rourke braiding a Fripp-like electric guitar lead and pedal steel around a violin line. Getting the mix perfect is supremely important; there’s never too much of anything, and nothing is ever buried. Midrange detail is prized over booming low end. Dynamics are powerful but not overpowering. Every instrument has its place.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <i>Simple Songs</i> is a subtle record that avoids extremes, which also makes it a record out of time. It’s a record that asks you to come to it. If O’Rourke ever felt the need to keep up with every development in music, that time has passed. After moving to Tokyo in the last decade, O’Rourke has been a less central figure. He stays busy in music, art, and film, but much of his work doesn’t travel beyond Japan. He has his handful of obsessions, his rules, his limitations, and once in a while he returns and gives us a record like this, something that will be sounding good five or 10 or 15 years from now, or whenever the next solo record comes along.</p></div>"|20488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20488-simple-songs/|8.6|Mark Richardson

This seems increasingly less important in the Internet age, when a 10-year-old can download the entire <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31559-carcass/"">Carcass</a> discography at the click of a button, and searching out obscure, far-flung scenes isn't as hard as it once was. We're living in a time when a novice can become an ""expert"" in a night, even if they don’t understand what begat what or comprehend the context. And that's why Noisem impressed people with 2013 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18233-noisem-agony-defined/""><i>Agony Defined</i></a>: Here we had guys between the ages of 15 and 20 coming off like folks twice their age, adroitly resurrecting the past.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Agony Defined</i>, which blurred nine songs into 26 minutes, was exhilarating, a mix of old-school whammy bar-rich thrash and death metal with little bits of grind and punk thrown about. People were fair when they brought up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"">Slayer</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5443-napalm-death"">Napalm Death</a>'s <i>Scum</i>. As mentioned when I called it my <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/9286-the-top-40-metal-albums-of-2013/""><span class=""s2"">10th favorite metal album of 2013</span></a>, it reminds me of the more extreme music that got me into metal as a kid, when I'd moved beyond the hair metal of my older sister and MTV and discovered speed and thrash at the pay-to-play venues in southern New Jersey. Their second album, <i>Blossoming Decay</i>, is burlier. The playing itself sturdier, faster, and more hulking. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Some of this could be due to the lineup change: bassist Yago Ventura is now handling guitar and vocalist Tyler Carnes' older brother, Billy, who also did the cover art, is on bass. (It's probably worth noting that the group now features two sets of brothers: the Carneses along with drummer Harley Phillips and his brother, guitarist Sebastian.) More likely, though, it's about getting more comfortable as songwriters and experimenters, hence the ambient cello pieces that start the first and second sides with an eerie, heavy drone. The blazing solos are still there, but the actual riffs pull as much of your attention this time. That, and the singing is freer, gnarlier, and more rabid—it's a nonstop vocal attack that comes off more punk and personal than <i>Agony.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On <i>Blossoming</i>, Noisem have worked in larger doses of grind and death and punk; there's less time to take hold of the whammy. We get nine songs in 24 minutes, and that includes those cello pieces (which come off as soft, low-tech industrial ambiance) as well as the 4-minute ""Cascade of Scars"", which opens on a doom note, and momentarily brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a>. For such a short album, there's plenty of variation, like the floor-punching youth crew pulse in ""1132"", the catchy opener ""Trail of Perturbation"", the blistering shout-along in ""Replant and Repress"". This is a record that'll appeal to punk kids—and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28767-trash-talk/"">Trash Talk</a> fans—as much as it'll blow the minds of metalheads.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In part, this is because, for all the technical prowess, there's a lot of heart on the record. In a recent <i>Decibel</i> feature, the Carnes brothers talked about their mother abandoning them at a young age, and being raised by their rock'n'roll-friendly father (who stole Billy a guitar to practice on when he was a kid). Tyler's mentioned being into Robert Smith's lyrics, and the words of Converge's Jacob Bannon—poetry, more or less. This album carries that kind of weight: flowers are reincarnated as shards (and, later tossed into the sea) and there are suicidal thoughts, sinking stomachs, lacerations, hazy memories. There's a lot of blood and more than a few knives. There's a general anxiety, along with a song called ""Another Night Sleeping in the Cold"", that resonates deeply when you know the singer's backstory.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This human element of Noisem is appealing. These are not songs about horror films, they're songs about the personal horrors of life and living. Which may be another reason that, as brief and rabid as these songs are, they stick with you. At the end of this cacophony, it's easy to want to listen all over again. And it's just as easy to be excited about how much these guys have already progressed in such a short time, and how much more music they have left to create.</span></p></div>"|20603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20603-blossoming-decay/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

""House is a feeling,"" exclaims the '91 Todd Terry <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kN6WtRhdyg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">staple</a>, to which Jupiter Jax seems to reply, ""House is<i> the</i> feeling.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So goes <i>Visions</i>, a generous debut album built on memories of house at its most euphonic and soft-focus. To his credit, Agius goes deep into the eras and locations he loves, even to the point of hosting Chicago house legend Merwyn Sanders, a founding member of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/2697-Virgo-Four"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Virgo Four</a>, on the gliding single ""The Light"". And though the addition looks nice on paper, it winds up somewhat gimmicky and half-baked in practice: Sanders' words of mystic wisdom are mumbled and buried under grandiose flute samples, New Age synths, and hand drums, almost like the most important part of his contribution was the feature credit. Jupiter Jax treats guest appearances by Xosar and Mykle Anthony with more care and precision, producing tracks that actually play to and spotlight their vocal strengths. <i>Visions</i> shines brightest when vintage house is used to help materialize the artist's own ideas. Too often, ""vintage house"" <i>is</i> the idea, full stop. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Suffice it to say the record could rightly be called a pastiche, albeit a varied one; nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13181-larry-heard/"">Larry Heard</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Trent"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ron Trent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1304-808-state/"">808 State</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"">the Orb</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10131-kevin-saunderson/"">Kevin Saunderson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25192-the-future-sound-of-london/"">the Future Sound of London</a>, and more pop up for those who are looking for them. Agius treats each familiar Roland synth patch and drum sample with reverence and tenderness, so when individual wrinkles appear, they make a big impact. ""The Deepest"" diverges into a low-lit '90s rave palette, and it initially comes off like a version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/"">Zomby</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEl0M7MQYk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tears in the Rain""</a> after the clouds cleared away. But about halfway through, Agius introduces an ascendent melodic theme and headstrong bassline, effectively lifting the mix off the soaked concrete. In that turn, we see Jupiter Jax for who he is—specifically, a tuneful artist interested in creating overtly romantic and emotional dancefloor experiences.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-3339628b-50fc-fe1f-1b28-b6f29ccf74e0""><span>Agius has knowingly set himself up against titans, so it's his attention to detail, sleek production chops, and compositional prowess that ultimately have to win out, and they do. </span><i>Visions </i><span>makes smart use of space for the most part, never choking out a track's atmosphere and rarely losing its way in a dense fog. Jupiter Jax just about overextends his abilities on ""Beyond the Walls"", but opener ""Armed for Peace"" and cloud-hopping standout ""Soul Searchin'"" are prime examples of what makes </span><i>Visions</i><span> so immediately likeable: two weightless grooves that want nothing more than to paint constellations behind your eyes. It doesn't matter much what dusty singles the tracks remind you of when Jupiter Jax plays them in a dark, crowded room.

Think, for a moment, of a rock guitarist or a jazz saxophonist or a classical pianist. Your mental picture probably involves the splay of their fingers, the angle of their backs, the tilt of their heads. But electronic music is largely disembodied. Imagine a studio, and you'll probably think of someone hunched over a computer keyboard; imagine a live performance and you'll probably think of the same thing.</p>
<p>For the Philadelphia electronic musician Charles Cohen, though, the gesture is everything, even if the gesture itself—flicking a switch, twisting a knob, quickly reconnecting a patch cable—is utilitarian rather than expressive. His instrument of choice is a <a href=""https://vimeo.com/87548701"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buchla Music Easel</a>, an arcane synthesizer built in limited quantities in the '70s. Where the evolution of electronic instruments has been, in large part, an arms race of bells and whistles, the Easel's biggest selling points are its limitations. It does without a traditional piano keyboard in favor of a touch keyboard, which forces the performer to search for modes that go beyond the typical 12-tone chromatic scale. More strikingly, the Easel features only a single oscillator, which means that it's capable of just one sound at a time. The tradeoff is the many possibilities the instrument offers for modulating and manipulating sound in real time. As Cohen <a href=""https://vimeo.com/87548701"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> at a workshop during the CTM Festival last year, ""All the action in the Easel is in control. That's sort of a Buchla concept: complicated control over simple sounds, as opposed to many other instruments, where you have very, very complex sounds but only simple control.""</p>
<p>Cohen, who is in his late sixties, has been at it long enough to have become a proper virtuoso on the Easel. He is primarily a performer and an improviser, not a recording artist. Two years ago, Rabih <span>Beaini</span>'s <a href=""http://www.morphinerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Morphine</a> label released a decade's worth of Cohen's experiments in a series of LPs that were eventually collected in the double-disc anthology, <i>A Retrospective</i>. But <i>Brother I Prove You Wrong</i> is all-new work, recorded specifically at Beaini's behest, and it reflects the lessons he has learned from years of live performance on the Easel. Whereas many of Cohen's earlier pieces had been made with the use of multi-tracked tape, the <i>Brother</i> tracks were all recorded using just the Buchla and a delay unit, and mostly done in single takes.</p>
<p>It is a curious sound, both spindly and sinewy all at once. In place of long, held tones, the music tends to proceed like a succession of water droplets. The careening blips bring to mind fireflies in a dark cavern or the orbits of subatomic particles; like atoms, the music consists primarily of empty space. The album begins, with ""Cloud Hands"", as if assembling itself out of nothingness, as arrhythmic whippoorwill trills gradually settle into a gentle contrapuntal pattern that feels, briefly, almost Baroque. The hypnotic ""Sacred Mountain"" chugs ahead at 85 beats per minute, with a steady 4/4 pulse and an ascending arpeggio that spins like a water wheel. It might almost be techno, and so might ""The Boy and the Snake Dance"", which, once it materializes out of the mist and locks into a regular tempo, brings to mind the pinging dissonance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5751-robert-hood/"">Robert Hood</a>.</p>
<p>As spare as the music may be, it's hard to believe that just one instrument is in play, particularly given the way that Cohen uses his sequencer and delay unit to create layers. ""Formation of Matter"" features sludgy bass formations shrouded in metallic echo; it feels like moving through a fog of iron fillings. The air is heavy with the memory of bells—all tail, no peal—and gossiping modems. In ""Beirut"", a dubby bassline reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3352-pole/"">Pole</a> paces beneath a rapid-fire battery of ring-mod tones. The illusion of fullness is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Cohen has said that he begins his performances by picking up where he last left off, and a similar sense of continuity runs through <i>Brother</i>. Some tracks are explicitly interconnected: In ""Visitors of the Sacred Mountain"", a faint echo of the previous track's main motif percolates deep in the mix, almost out of earshot, shrouded in brittle, crystalline chirps, like the cries of frozen birds. Mostly, though, the through line makes itself felt in the way Cohen's single-oscillator synth morphs across the course of the album.</p>
<p>It is in constant motion. Otherwise repetitive arpeggios dodge and feint around their indicated paths, ululating pitches rise and fall, and the music's timbre is as mutable as a bead of quicksilver. It sometimes feels like you're listening to the inner life of a dial tone. As it happens, the mind/body duality appears in ""Mankind and Mannequins"", a groaning, gurgling piece accompanied by a surrealist, spoken-word vignette that asks what the thoughts of a rock and a mannequin might sound like. It is a static scene, a scene of stillness, yet the sound is restless—indicative, perhaps, of the motion inside these apparently inanimate objects. The rock lies inert, the mannequin's hand is crooked just so. But the atoms that comprise the sound of their thoughts are a nonstop swirl.</p></div>"|20546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20546-brother-i-prove-you-wrong/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

Brandon Welchez and Charles Rowell continue to crash at the Reid brothers’ pad for the first half of their fifth album, but by side two of <i>Boys</i>, they’re finally ready to move out. Maybe it will be good for them; this flat was getting pretty musty anyway.<br/><br/><i>Boys</i> has the requisite reverb and guitar fuzz and Welchez talk-singing about life ""in the clubs, on them drugs."" The first few songs are living-on-the-edge narratives that would sound way more badass were they not discredited by clichés like ""cold as ice"" and ""sharp like razorblades."" It also doesn’t help how heavily they borrow from badasses who came before them. There’s a big Ringo drum fill in ""Foolin’ Around"" that is so recognizable it takes away from anything original that might be going on around it. And when Welchez delivers the phrase ""down on the street"" in ""Crybaby Demon"", you can almost hear his rationale during a corporate presentation: ""The Stooges sang a song called ‘Down on the Street’, so if we plop that phrase into this song here, we can optimize our badass market viability.""<br/><br/>The irony is that there was no board of directors to impress with <i>Boys. </i>It’s being released on the Zoo Music imprint, which Welchez runs with his wife, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"">Dum Dum Girls</a> frontwoman Dee Dee Penny. (The album was also made possible by a <a href=""http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/crocodiles"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PledgeMusic</a> campaign.) So why do Crocodiles end up sounding like the world’s safest dangerous band? Maybe because as tenants of the Reids’, they don’t want to rearrange too much? Maybe they want to ease their fans into their new sound? <br/><br/>Whatever the reason, by the fifth track, when Welchez asks, ""Hey, boy! Why you gotta be so hard?"" he might as well be posing this question to himself, as he takes off his leather jacket and begins to explore the emotions and rhythms of recording in Mexico City. It’s almost as if the first half of the album is comprised of songs that Crocodiles had finished writing by the time they got to the studio, and the second half is all of the stuff that they came up with while they were there. And this exploratory spirit is where <i>Boys</i> finds its strength. <br/><br/>All cool guy posturing is gone by the time they get to ""Blue"", a wispy melody that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4746-the-zombies/"">the Zombies</a>. This might be the most honest thing Crocodiles have recorded yet, with lyrics like, ""Years chained up in shame, nothing but family to blame/ Now when darkness arrives it swallows all that lived inside."" Also noteworthy is the interplay between the polished pop structure and the queasy guitar on ""Peroxide Hearts"". It's unclear what they are going for with the song ""Transylvania"", which seems to broach themes of trans-identity. The spirit of the song is reverent and anthemic, but lines like ""sometimes it's such a drag to be a man"" miss the mark, unless the mark was groan-inducing puns. Incidentally, the song's chorus may be the catchiest thing on <i>Boys, </i>and whatever else it represents, it shows us Crocodiles actively moving outside of their comfort zone.<br/><br/>The same goes for the syncopated rhythms they put under numbers like ""Kool TV"" and album closer ""Don’t Look Up"". Whether this was the influence of producer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyU9hPiUrf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Martin Thulin</a>, the band soaking up their environs in Mexico City, or a little bit of both, it’s a winning combination. Crocodiles have referred to this new sound as salsa-punk and ""muy chingón!"" which, roughly translated, means ""fucking awesome"" in Spanish. They don’t quite get the salsa part right, but that’s what makes this unique. Some of the most inventive music can come from people not quite understanding a different kind of music: The fact that this braver experimentalism rounds out an album that begins with old formulaic fuzz provides hope that the next Crocodiles release will actually be fucking awesome.</p></div>"|20595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20595-boys/|5.6|Pat Healy

He doesn't just talk about desire and hate and pushing oneself in his music, he soaks those very feelings into his works. Within his massive discography, littered with limited-release tapes that can be frustrating to any would-be collector, are his ""statement"" records, which often introduce new elements that advance his artistic growth. Among these are 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9694-pleasure-ground/""><i>Pleasure Ground</i></a>, where his talents for rhythm really started to bloom, 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15651-bermuda-drain/"">Bermuda Drain</a>, </i>his blackened new wave masterpiece<i>,</i> and 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17665-prurient-through-the-window/""><i>Through The Window</i></a>, where he nearly ditched noise for unknown-hours techno. <i>Frozen Niagara Falls</i>, Fernow's latest double album, is definitely one of his ""statement records,"" and it brings back much of the harsh noise that faded away from his more recent works, but it's neither a ""return to form"" nor a retreat into his early career. With <i>Niagara</i>, he's taken strengths from his entire oeuvre to reach deeper into himself and produce what may be his best record yet, one that brings all the fulfillment of noise and transcends them all the same.</p>
<p>Fernow's moved back to New York from L.A., where he was briefly a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"">Cold Cave</a>, and <i>Niagara</i> cements that return. There's none of the techno of <i>Window</i> or any traces of his European adventures following his side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30495-vatican-shadow/"">Vatican Shadow</a>'s frequent touring there, and only some of <i>Bermuda</i>'s bizzaro synth-pop. There are no remaining traces of Fernow the underground playboy posting swanky selfies on <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EfH_OzDsO5o/TxBwgdOXQPI/AAAAAAAABBU/ixgoboXgnHM/s1600/Prurient%2B6676470438968806740.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OkCupid</a>; on <i>Niagara</i>, he is once again the man standing shirtless outside in the New York winter. The closest to anything resembling <i>Bermuda</i> is ""Every Relationship Earthrise"", which would make for excellent darkwave if the hiccuping beat would hold still.<b> </b></p>
<p>Fernow takes the tools most noise artists use as ends themselves and uses them to further narratives and enrich the compositions. Take ""Traditional Snowfall"", which starts off as a murder-romance fantasy—""I want to rip out your lower back/ And suck the air out of your lungs/ And wrap my hands around your neck/ And collapse your throat/ And squish your thorax/ And kiss you""—but turns into a rumination on the ambiguity so prevalent in modern love: ""Friends are everywhere but I'm always leaving/ Dismantling us with rumors."" (Maybe some of the club weariness of <i>Window</i> stuck around after all.) Fernow takes that confusion and buries it in the hisses and frantic electronics, so that it bleeds through every element of the track. Huge blasts of static and contact mic chaos come back into the fore, a passionate and turbulent dance between beauty and ugliness. To work with contrasts like that, on that deep a composition, is a rarity in noise.</p>
<p>It may seem weird that Prurient would have ""hits"" or ""fan favorites,"" but they do exist. Fernow designed <i>Niagara</i> to be sprawling and cohesive, and there are multiple competing candidates for new ones here, across the spectrum. The first would probably be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17393-prurient-dragonflies-to-sew-you-up/"">""Dragonflies to Sew You Up""</a>, with percussion that resemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"">Godflesh</a>'s drum machine becoming sentient and suffering a panic attack. Beneath the barrage, blue synthesizers and pianos chime, barely surviving the mortar-fire of the percussion. In the lyrics, Fernow flips the script on how lust is portrayed in noise—it's far from the simplistic objectification that comes too often with big, burly loud music. There's a conflicted pain when he screams, ""IN AUGUST/ YOU'RE OVERDRESSED/ PLYWOOD BROKEN/ UP ON IMPACT."" A line like ""I promise I will only fuck prostitutes"" may seem comical on paper, but add in the context of Fernow's vocal performance, and it's clear he takes no pleasure from yelling such a thing.</p>
<p>Fernow's synths sound both lusher and icier than they did on <i>Drain</i>, thanks to producer Arthur Rizk, known for his work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31190-power-trip/"">Power Trip</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17893-power-trip-manifest-decimation/""><i>Manifest Decimation</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23043-inquisition/"">Inquisition</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18620-inquisition-obscure-verses-for-the-multiverse/""><i>Obscure Verses for the Multiverse</i></a>, and other notable recent metal and hardcore records. Fernow has pushed the limits of what lo-fi can do—<i>Pleasure</i> in particular is a testament to the beauty of buried synths—but with his grander ambitions, he needed a bigger sound, and Rizk's contributions are so invaluable he may as well be Prurient's second member. <i>Niagara</i> is Prurient's most developed record, not just for its length, but the attention to detail that Rizk provides.</p>
<p>Fernow's original intent for <i>Niagara</i> was to source all of the material acoustically, with no electronics at all. That would have been radical, even for him. Still, upon first listen, it is jarring to hear acoustic guitars, provided by Rizk and Fernow, in the beginning of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17449-prurient-greenpoint/"">""Greenpoint""</a>, <i>Niagara</i>'s peak New York song. From there, it descends into throbs of darkness, but that's only part of the point of the song. While ""Greenpoint"" is about someone Fernow knew, when I read the lyrics my mind went to Oliver Sacks' <i>New Yorker</i> <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/the-catastrophe-oliver-sacks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">essay</a> on monologist Spalding Gray's descent into irreversible depression that led to his suicide in 2004. Gray's thoughts of suicide always centered around drowning and his mother, whose own suicide figured heavily into his work, and it's eerie that ""The East River isn't romantic anymore you know/ That's where the suicides go/ Or maybe that's what you want in the end/ To be mixed together and reunited with your mother"" are almost as if they were about him. It's specific yet flexible, adding another layer of complexity as only Fernow can.</p>
<p>Like ""Greenpoint"", closer ""Christ Among the Broken Glass"" shows a side of Prurient that is sometimes overlooked: poignancy. It's also the closest thing to Fernow's original vision for <i>Niagara</i>, which makes it an even more appropriate ending. The sound of fire combines with the guitars, evoking a séance more than a campfire. Like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5NNC4qITt8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Understand You""</a>, the closing track from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30409-jk-flesh/"">JK Flesh</a> and Prurient's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17406-worship-is-the-cleansing-of-the-imagination/""><i>Worship Is the Cleansing of the Imagination</i></a> where fragile glimmers of serenity are eaten without mercy by squalling feedback, ""Christ"" reveals itself slowly. <i>Niagara</i> was recorded ""in the spirit of homelessness,"" and Fernow's lyrics in ""Christ"" capture how winter brutalizes the homeless and how self-sacrifice can make one appear messianic, especially when that figure is among the afflicted themselves. The man, ""Jesus of cities,"" becomes both more noble and more destitute with every verse—""Cobbling together syllables/ Over a frostbitten tongue/ Trying to remember the prayers""—though this isn't about pity, but about reality. Fernow's hushed vocals don't even come in until close to the end of the song, and they make his silent stalker tone on <i>Window</i> sound pronounced in comparison. Who knew that one of the least noisy Prurient songs would strike the deepest? </p>
<p>A double noise album is a lot to take in, and Prurient's never been about accessibility. He's also not about acceptable signifiers; he's bigger than noise. He offers an endless, probing self-exploration that simply isn't found in noise, metal, hardcore, power electronics, whatever harsh music you can think of. In that regard, <i>Niagara</i> is a landmark not just in Prurient's discography, but within extreme music. His few utterances in ""Falling Mask"" sum up the experience of the album, and of his body of work: ""What we do/ We invite pain/ It's ok to be hungry/ Hunger is normal/ I'll meet you there."" He knows Prurient isn't for everybody, and that's part of the appeal, but if you're not going to invite growth and reveal yourself, why bother?</p></div>"|20463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20463-prurient-frozen-niagara-falls/|8.5|Andy O'Connor

The way a skilled Adobe Creative Suite architect takes old, obscure fonts and images and re-appropriates them against a backdrop of razor-sharp typesetting and wide-open white space is retro-futurist art of the highest order, and it is similar to the way the Miami-born, Atlanta-bred producer builds his beats from fragments of voices, instruments and found sounds reprocessed through his MPC.

The way a skilled Adobe Creative Suite architect takes old, obscure fonts and images and re-appropriates them against a backdrop of razor-sharp typesetting and wide-open white space is retro-futurist art of the highest order, and it is similar to the way the Miami-born, Atlanta-bred producer builds his beats from fragments of voices, instruments and found sounds reprocessed through his MPC. And while he got his start in the experimental/post-rock realm under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1052-delarosa-and-asora/"">Delarosa and Asora</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3701-savath-y-savalas/"">Savath y Savalas</a> monikers, it was Prefuse 73 that exhibited Herren's true skill set as a producer and composer. His grooves were not so much chopped up and flipped, in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a> sense, as they were shattered like an antique plate, only to be reassembled with the delicacy of a day-camp craft project.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His debut under the Prefuse handle, 2001's <i>Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives</i>, harnessed the energy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>'s <i>Kid A</i> and planted its formula smack in the middle of a white-hot hip-hop New York City underground, in the midst of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitive_Jux"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Def Jux</a>'s heyday. It also gave Herren's label at the time, <a href=""http://warp.net/artists/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp Records</a>, the credibility it so desperately sought out upon moving their offices to New York City: In the years that followed, Warp would come to depend on Herren's uncanny knowledge and talent as a de facto A&amp;R guy to help the label transcend its rep as a purely IDM imprint by introducing them to some of their most popular acts, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/104-anti-pop-consortium/"">Anti-Pop Consortium</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"">Battles</a>, and a young DJ out of Los Angeles by the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>.</p>

Now, with a minor hit in 2014's Cash Money-referencing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8kNWkAcMBw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hot Boy""</a>, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a> cosign, and Instagram shout-outs from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> and, uh, <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/02/drake-marilyn-manson-loves-bankroll-fresh"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marilyn Manson</a>, he is Bankroll Fresh, one of several young ATLiens making a move for his city's street rap center.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of his older pedigree, the rapper's style doesn't owe Gucci as much of a stylistic debt as others in the current Atlanta rookie class. This is his substantial advantage: at a time when most emulate a series of now-conventional flows, Bankroll seems intent on scratching out his own fresh rhythmic pathways, discovering his own pocket in the groove. (""Free Wop Freestyle (Free Gucci)"" is the exception that proves the rule.) Bankroll's vocal tone doesn't have the same effortless panache and character of Gucci's own; in some ways he seems downright regular. But Gucci's influence looms so large in Atlanta street rap that this is a refreshing strategy, exhibiting an inner artistic confidence. Externally, though, <i>Life of a Hot Boy 2: Real Trapper</i> is a spare, skeletal record, more a model on which to build possible futures than a real destination.</p>
<p>The album is least imaginative in its opening moments, which feel like an overt attempt to recapture the spirit of <i>Trap or Die</i>/<i>Thug Motivation</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a>, with producer D.Rich emulating the sheet metal symphonies of Shawty Redd. But the bulk of the tape sticks to Bankroll's core sound, an unwavering flatline on a black-and-white canvas, dominated by locked-in, often against-the-beat flows (""Thats Whats Goin On"") that emphasize repetition with the deliberate percussiveness of a typewriter. Thus far none of his records have replicated the success of his last tape's big single ""Hot Boy"", and none here seem poised to do so either. But even that record felt like something of an uphill hit, its chorus successful mainly through bludgeoning repetition.</p>
<p>The effect of this dry, minimal approach to trap music is going to limit this tape's audience from the jump: to enjoy this record, you've got to really love the bare-bones particulars of street music, distilled not so much in the service of therapeutic aggression—as it was for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/""><i>Flockaveli</i></a>—but as a kind of audience GPS. To put it bluntly, the album's subject matter doesn't extend too far beyond that of Gucci's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCil-kLGkvc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""My Kitchen""</a>. Here, it suggests, is Atlanta's missing piece, at a time when eccentric ATLiens like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug"">Young Thug</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a> experiment with different textural palettes and shades of emotion. Bankroll, by contrast, hasn't fleshed out his world much yet, leaving these songs as line-drawings of the dope dealer day-to-day over three-note piano loops.</p>
<p>Not that there aren't inspired moments, particularly in the tape's second half. The Zaytoven-produced ""Ten"" features some tongue-twisting lyrics (""Livin like the mob, fly to Vegas just to ditch ya/ Dom Perignon sipper, cigar-clipper, Vuitton slippers""). The buzzing King Cee O-produced ""360"", much like his ""Screen Door"" collaboration with Mike WiLL on the latter's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20125-ransom/""><i>Ransom</i></a>, suggests the rapper's style works best with some driving momentum behind him. The tape's best song overall is the D.Rich-produced ""Fabulous"". With brushed snares that sound lifted from former No Limit producer KLC, quivering synthesizers borrowed from Gucci Mane's Fat Boi-produced <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_gktVy6600"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Haunted House""</a>, and a piano loop that suggests the atmosphere of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">2Pac</a>'s DeVante Swing-produced <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2mCW_swjaE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No More Pain""</a>, the song is at once several sounds and none—less a costume than a creation.</p>
<p>The stripped-down sound of the record makes Bankroll easily adaptable to different styles—the album's closer is a Zaytoven version of Master P's <a href=""https://vimeo.com/70607105"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm Bout It, Bout It""</a>—without committing too completely to anything, and his facility for off-center flows is impressive. But he also stands in the shadow of more audacious experiments that have hit hip-hop in recent years: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>, of course, has been doing the against-the-groove rap style for some time. But he's the tip of the iceberg in Detroit, where artists like Pablo Skywalkin and Yae Yae Jordan experiment radically while keeping the street approach at the forefront. In the drill scene, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Keef</a> has incorporated melody into his songs while virtually uncoupling himself from the rhythmic grid, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30015-king-louie/"">King Louie</a> experimented with repeating flow patterns (and even recorded his own similar Gucci flow tribute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCq6PMACVS4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">back in 2009</a>).</p>
<p>Atlanta is a hotbed of hip-hop talent, it's true, but that's also a marketing cliche. Now that its singular space within hip-hop has been so well-established over the past two decades, each new artist arrives with the pressure of its city's proven track record behind it as decorative momentum. Only today, Atlanta faces new challengers, and artists like Bankroll don't have as clear a lane as they once did. This isn't to suggest Bankroll Fresh isn't an original voice. But just being from Atlanta may no longer guarantee you the biggest footprint, and <i>Life of a Hot Boy 2</i> doesn’t make much of one by itself.</p></div>"|20499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20499-life-of-a-hot-boy-2-real-trapper/|6.4|David Drake

But sometimes old sounds can be worth revisiting, especially if they're molded by a particularly sure hand. Newcomer Gacha Bakradze, who hails from Tbilisi, Georgia and splits his time between Paris and his native city, isn't interested in carving out a signature, cutting-edge sound. Instead, his debut LP, <i>Send Two Sunsets</i>, floats atop a bath of well-worn nostalgia that, by definition (and purpose), asks little of its audience except to be soothed.</p>
<p>In his press materials, Gacha cites shoegazers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>, German experimentalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>, and Madchester mainstays <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"">the Durutti Column</a> among his inspirations. Each touchstone is easy to spot—so easy, that, at times, <i>Two Sunsets</i> scans as an homage to its forebears. Like much of Cluster's ambient work, Gacha’s leans towards sounds that are unabashedly pleasurable to experience. The aptly titled ""Bliss"", featuring Natalie Beridze—a frequent collaborator of Gacha's who also performs under the name TBA—shifts between delicate synth-pop and ambient psychedelia. ""Blue Distance"", on the other hand, uses MIDI plugins seemingly discovered beneath <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHFIN55q9pQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dire, Dire Docks</a> or sourced from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g4dkBF5anU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cisco</a>'s ""Opus Number 1"" CallManager Muzak. Though Gacha employs those tools deftly, the spa-day palette recalls sounds that have also been mined by recent producers looking to revive new age in the new millennium; fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">How to Dress Well</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13650-ocean-floor-for-everything/"">""Ocean Floor for Everything""</a> will recognize a shared sentimentality for 64-bit sequencing.</p>
<p><i>Send Two Sunsets</i> comes on the heels of two EPs, <i>Remember</i> and <i>When the Watchman Saw the Light</i>, both released via <a href=""https://randsrecords.greedbag.com/dept/~apollo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Apollo Records</a>, the ambient-leaning subdivision of <a href=""http://www.randsrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R&amp;S Records</a>.

But it's clear from the beginning that <i>Send Two Sunsets</i> is more historical excavation than vanguard innovation—a position Gacha seems happy to occupy. <i>Sunsets</i> can largely be seen as a continuation of Gacha's previous two releases, whose tracks ebb and flowed with a similarly harmonious calm. (Just looking at the album cover will likely give you some idea of Gacha's palette, whose Mediterranean rhythms evoke the Balearic '80s at their most relaxed.)</p>
<p>Over the course of its relatively brief nine tracks, <i>Send Two Sunsets</i> oscillates between low-key house (""Street Talk""), bubbling ambient (""Blue Distance""), and meditative pop (""Send Two Sunsets""), but all share similarly aquatic presets. Album opener ""Abandoned City"" falls into the first category, with New Age arpeggios and no percussive elements to speak of. It's a sound that brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29786-jurgen-muller/"">Jürgen Müller</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15696-science-of-the-sea/""><i>Science of the Sea</i></a>, an album that had originally been marketed as a rediscovered record from the early '80s only to be revealed later to be a modern production.</p>
<p>Here, there's a similar feeling of productions that have been submerged and forgotten only to be unearthed decades later. ""Waterfall"", a gorgeous track that also features Beridze, shimmers like refracted sunlight. Then there's ""Let Me Love You"", an amalgam of deep house and deconstructed R&amp;B that sets indistinct vocals amidst piano and understated percussion; repeat listens reveal a track not only exceedingly pretty, but disarmingly soulful. More often than not, <i>Sunsets</i> continues to reveal new facets the more time you spend with it, the familiar giving way to deeper emotional undercurrents just below the surface.</p></div>"|20440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20440-send-two-sunsets/|7.1|Nathan Reese

As the mainstream product increasingly incorporates <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/arts/music/country-music-opens-its-ears.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new sounds and attitudes</a>, there will always be audiences yearning for the sparer, ""rootsier"" sounds transporting them back to the days of the Highwaymen. It's an evergreen niche, and it is forever welcoming to new entrants.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Enter Oklahoman songwriter John Moreland. Though Moreland has been making this sort of music since 2008—his last release was 2013's <i><a href=""http://johnmoreland.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-throes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In the Throes</a></i>, a sorrowful and spare collection of heavy-hearted country rockers—his background playing in <a href=""http://www.americansongwriter.com/2015/04/john-morelands-heat-wave/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">local punk and hardcore groups </a>gives him a good feel for forcefulness. Many of the songs on Moreland's new album <i>High on Tulsa Heat</i>, arguably Moreland's prettiest if not his most most musically vivid release, capture this feeling—""Cherokee"", in particular, weaves a solemn guitar line with Moreland's weathered vocal to devastating effect. (""I've got a taste for poison/ I'm giving up on ever being well/ I keep mining the horizon/ Digging for lies I've yet to tell."")</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>High on Tulsa Heat</i><span> is filled with simple delights like ""Cherokee"". Songs like opener ""Hang Me in the Tulsa County Stars"" and the title track push Moreland's voice forward while accenting its weary wisdom with simple accompaniments—sliding guitar, pedal steel, economically applied—and harmonies (""Heart's Too Heavy""). </span><i>High on Tulsa Heat </i><span>finds a nice balance between the spare and sad (""Cleveland County Blues"") and warm moods, and on balance, it's strangely uplifting.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cef0f0fc-4e32-50b6-11ac-69971cadbe79"">Moreland lacks the cynical sharpness and humor of fellow travelers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32293-sturgill-simpson/"">Sturgill Simpson</a>—whose <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19386-sturgill-simpson-metamodern-sounds-in-country-music/"">Metamodern Sounds of Country Music</a></i> stands as a high watermark for this generation's wave of ""alt country"". Moreland's songs are simpler and open up in more conventional ways. On <i>High on Tulsa Heat</i>, small details feel like major victories—for instance, the soft tambourine and shaker flourishes on album highlight ""White Flag"". Moreland's music is sad, to be sure—but even as he's singing about being useless and an addict (""You need something stronger/ A drug to kill the hunger/ And ease the awful pain of living here"" from ""You Don't Care for Me Enough to Cry""), you can hear a palpable hope for redemption coursing through. There is plenty of well-worn sentiment and saltiness in his music, but there is also a relatable humanity that makes <i>High on Tulsa Heat</i> worth going back to. Though many of the songs convey images of earthiness and of dirt, there's a beauty that helps the collection soar above the ground. </span></p></div>"|20540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20540-high-on-tulsa-heat/|7.0|Corban Goble

His voice sounds good over all kinds of production, but some of his best late-period work has come when collaborating with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"">the Neptunes</a>. The success of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FE194VN6c4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beautiful""</a> established Snoop, the Neptunes, and Charlie Wilson as a powerful team, and led to the Virginia producers contributing several tracks (including the chart-topping <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtUVQei3nX4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Drop It Like It’s Hot""</a>) to his 2004 album, <i>R&amp;G (Rhythm &amp; Gangsta): The Masterpiece</i>. With <i>Bush</i>, fans who might have yearned for a Snoop album produced entirely by the Neptunes at the time (almost) get their wish: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell Williams</a> handles the boards here, with occasional assistance from his former production partner Chad Hugo.</p>
<p><i>Bush</i> was conceived as a tribute to the funk and R&amp;B of the 1970s, and the familiar wail of Stevie Wonder’s harmonica on the stand-out opener, ""California Roll"", establishes the mood. Over an instrumental as smooth as a ride down Rodeo Drive on an 85-degree day, Snoop's croon is convincing enough to sell lines like “So if you wanna go to Melrose/ Let’s hit Adidas, girl, we got our own shell toes."" Pharrell positions L.A. as the nucleus of luxury and vice (""Baby you can be a movie star/ Get yourself a medical card, yeah/ ‘Cause that’s how California rolls"") on the sticky hook, and Wonder accents P’s trademark falsetto with background vocals.</p>
<p>Both Snoop and Pharrell are products of the '70s, so it makes sense that they'd embrace the ambiance of the music they grew up listening to, and that they'd be pretty good at it. The mood holds from the bubbly disco of ""R U A Freak"" to the Nile Rodgers-inspired guitar work on ""Awake"", a song that brings to mind the second wind you get during a party’s final 20 minutes. On ""Peaches N Cream"", Snoop, Pharrell, and Wilson combine once again for an infectious retro-funk fusion. From start to finish, <i>Bush</i> is a feel-good record.</p>
<p>Snoop has said that he tapped Pharrell for creative guidance because he wanted a cohesive sound for the album. At just 41 minutes long, <i>Bush</i> is indeed an easy listen, but the songs also bleed together. ""I Knew That"", for example, opens with the same motif as the one used on the superior ""Peaches N Cream"". And although the album features just 10 songs, it feels like there are only about six. <i>Bush</i> is designed to function as an old funk record that you can let run for an entire party’s duration, but its uniformity might make it less appealing over the long haul.</p>
<p>Still, it makes sense for Snoop to be making this type of music at this stage of his career, as he approaches his mid-forties and rap recedes into his past. The music puts past images of him <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJtOWAjn7_8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">grooving to Bootsy Collins while stoned in <i>Baby Boy</i></a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjiTqF_FePM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dancing to Funkadelic in <i>The Wash</i></a> in perspective—funk has long been his lifeblood. So while <i>Bush</i> is strong enough musically, you can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if this crew had followed <i>R&amp;G</i> with a full-length a decade ago, when everyone involved was still in his prime.</p></div>"|20435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20435-bush/|6.5|Julian Kimble

In retrospect, it’s shocking everyone didn’t immediately grasp <i>exactly</i> why. Never mind the talk of career repositioning and the Super Glue-sticky singles and the high-fashion diva-ing—<i>Overpowered</i> may not have been immediate, but it was classic in its own way, and prescient. There’s no shortage of people dissecting her influence on <a href=""http://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/roisin-murphy-lady-gaga-stole-my-look-52665487-237654061.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">other artists’ gonzo fashion</a>, and many artists are now making dancefloor tracks that embrace house piano and disco tropes, even if they’d fizzle and die if held up next to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_vCOOW_BsE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Let Me Know""</a>. But given the modern dance revival’s rigid stratification of artists into<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19933-kiesza-sound-of-a-woman/""> shrugged-away female vocalists</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18091-disclosure-settle/"">celebrated male producer-celebrities</a>, perhaps it’s for the best that Murphy has shied away from trends, and with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1PYOjEfmNI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a few exceptions</a>, mostly foregone guest spots.</p>
<p>Indeed, Murphy’s output over the past near-decade has been wildly unpredictable, ranging from dance bangers with porno guitars (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c96XmnYaj6M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Orally Fixated""</a>) to an Édith Piaf-inspired EP of Italian art songs not to mention two <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/thevinylfactory/sets/roisin-murphy-mi-senti-remixes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix EPs</a> that might have stirred the highest of emotions on the dancefloor, if only people heard them. And <i>Hairless Toys</i> continues this trend. It’s the most cerebral work of Murphy’s decades-long career, and arguably the one with her <a href=""http://www.harderbloggerfaster.com/2015/04/roisin-murphy-makes-directorial-debut-with-video-for-her-new-single-exploitation/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most creative control yet</a>, letting listeners closer into her head than ever yet keeping them at a distance even there.</p>
<p>The album comes with a few preconceptions. ""Gone Fishing"" was inspired by the New York ball scene, which, coming from a white Irish woman well after ball culture <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/nov/18/-sp-vogueing-dance-came-back-into-vogue-madonna"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">returned to the mainstream</a>, has the potential to get dicey fast. And Murphy’s rationale for the record—""I envisioned ‘Gone Fishing’ almost as a song from a Broadway musical version of [iconic documentary <i>Paris Is Burning</i>]""—is not so far from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a> co-opting vogueing into <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJQSAiODqI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a machine</a> to make herself endless context-free royalties. But ""Gone Fishing"" is less sonic homage, more earnest expression of empathy. And if <i>Hairless Toys </i>takes anything from that world<i> </i>it’s the subtext: it’s largely an album about confronting one’s failures and anxieties and outsider feelings and mythologizing them.</p>
<p>Sometimes others are invited in. ""Exploitation"" is nine-and-a-half minutes of circling closer and closer around one obsessive question: ""Who’s exploiting who?"" The sexual overtones are there if you’re looking for them, the sociological analogies almost make themselves: artists exploiting subjects, or vice versa. But that’s all overly serious for a track this deliberately whimsical: polyrhythms, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d8ROhH3_vs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cartoon cliff-dive</a> of a guitar riff after the lyric ""the depths that they will go,"" fax-machine noises—all fascinating sounds, manipulated one after the other to make you think they mean something.</p>
<p>""Exploitation"" is also the most traditional single on an album mostly concerned with inner pain. ""Uninvited Guest"" is more typical, describing a quite specific emotional state: the near-agoraphobic inertia—total inactivity from the outside, a deafening restless twitch on the inside—that comes of anxiety and having enough money to stay there forever: ""I could get out of my head/ Even all the money I have left, I could buy another day of nothing."" The music’s somewhere between synesthesia of the mood and a dark joke at its own expense: hi-hat tremors, backing vocals elbowing through the mix, a bridge to lose time in, a helpless shrug of a whistling line. (Murphy, like just about everyone who shares a genre and gender, has fought off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush"">Kate Bush</a> comparisons, and <a href=""http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/roisin-murphy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">continues to do so</a>; but ""Guest"", in topic and particularly in its wry gallows humor, is much like an introvert’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHMBvP0LKwI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sat in Your Lap""</a>.)</p>
<p>""Exile"" is a torch song delivered in a wearied whisper, every note heard through smoke, evoking less the dance floor than a bar that’s 2 a.m. empty. ""Unputdownable"" is a traditional Murphy extended metaphor—lover as page-turning book—with a mid-track swerve that reveals it not as a love song but something less requited, more unknowable: ""I’d open up the book and climb right up out of the town...if you’d allow me to read your mind."" (Like much of <i>Hairless Toys</i>, it almost seems like a comment on the record as well.)</p>
<p>It’s heady stuff, but the album’s emotional landscape is sketched so distinctly there’s ample reason to stick with it. There’s also, three-fourths through, a musical payoff. ""House of Glass"" delivers grand statements, often set stark against the music as if underlined in fire: ""We were glass house girls in our plastic wigs and pearls""; ""People like us from broken homes never throw stones""; ""Little pieces of a broken dream""; ""Built a house of glass out of fragments from the blast."" Fittingly, it also builds up to the album’s centerpiece: the chords from ""Exploitation"", the ascending peals from ""Gone Fishing"", disco guitar licks and swarming background vocals assembled into a fragile yet stunning climax. It’s all gleaming and immaculate from a distance, sharp and shattered if you get too close.</p></div>"|20518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20518-hairless-toys/|7.4|Katherine St. Asaph

From the band's unlikely (but fittingly epic) use in the 2012 London Olympics <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47290-olympics-opening-ceremony-arctic-monkeys-underworld-dizzee-rascal-and-fuck-buttons/"">opening ceremony</a>, to its status as festival mainstays, Fuck Buttons have brought music of the most punishing variety to an unusual level of popularity. If ""pop"" is what's popular, then Fuck Buttons fit the bill by definition, but no other act of their level can claim to scorch audiences with Fisher-Price-processed screams, only to rocket into a stratosphere of major-key bliss. For every club-leaning detour (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnpHM8lJexk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Prince's Prize""</a>) or humanist anthem (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQZo2rsReEM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Olympians""</a>), there's a relentless <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXXVPlrY974"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Brainfreeze""</a> to remind us that the band is as unruly as ever.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The same can be said for the duo's solo ventures. Though <i>Dumb Flesh </i>is the second full-length LP from Blanck Mass, the stage name used by Benjamin John Power, it's been four years since his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15572-blanck-mass/"">self-titled debut</a> and three since his ""White Math / Polymorph"" single. In that time Fuck Buttons also released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18295-fuck-buttons-slow-focus/""><i>Slow Focus</i></a>, their biggest-sounding record to date, and Andrew Hung, who records under his given name, dropped the retro-bizarro weirdness that was the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20405-rave-cave-ep/""><i>Rave Cave</i> EP</a>. (Sure, Beck plays a Game Boy on stage, but who can say they made an entire album on one?) <i>Dumb Flesh </i>is an often-fascinating document of Power's evolving tastes over that time period, as well as a departure from his murky first album. While <i>Blanck Mass</i> often featured glacial build-ups and monotonous loops, <i>Dumb Flesh </i>is filled with handclaps, 808s and is-that-human-or-what? vocal samples. But for a record whose cover art is pinkish folds of human biomass, much of <i>Dumb Flesh</i> is actually pretty darn accessible. It also serves as occasional proof that Power is amenable to the idea that people might actually want to, like, <i>dance </i>to his music.</p>
<p>As the title and cover art suggest, <i>Dumb Flesh</i> is an album about the fragility of the human body, one that uses sonic degeneration as a metaphor for the biological kind. Opener ""Loam"" is a sound-collage of groaning vocals enmeshed with reversed tape hiss, while a mid-tempo chillout cut with squelching synths and a head-bobbing beat is called ""Atrophies"". Across the record, Power uses sounds that meld into each other fluidly, an ouroboros of cyclical synths where you don't know where one loop begins and another ends.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Fuck Buttons solo projects often give the chance to spot individual seams in what usually appears as a singular, monolithic endeavor, but <i>Dumb Flesh </i>could be mistaken for the latest Fuck Buttons album, albeit one looser and less cohesive than usual. The themes may be dark, but the songs often contain the ecstatic blissfulness of the band's best and most transcendental beauty. ""Cruel Sport"", a name that echoes Fuck Buttons' enormous-sounding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13617-tarot-sport/"">second album</a>, for instance, starts with a driving beat similar to ""Olympians"", but just before the five-minute mark the synths clatter and collapse into a squiggling pile—a breakdown in the literal and metaphorical sense. The shift plays like a commentary on Power's past; rather than achieving total liftoff, Power proves he can still take us all the way there and then deliberately doesn't. While ""Cruel Sport"" works, sometimes the less intense tracks don't quite land; ""Lung"" is a low-key track that sounds like you're waiting for a particularly avant-garde conference call—pleasant, but it's just not what Power does best.</p>
<p>Largely, however,<i> Dumb Flesh</i> is a pleasure. Album closer and highlight ""Detritus"" has multiple movements and features Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3044-90-day-men/"">90 Day Men</a> on vocals. It's here that all of Power's strengths come out at once: dark noise gives way to a pounding rhythm which, in turn, melts into a tapestry of airy synths. If <i>Dumb Flesh</i> is about the prison of the body, ""Detritus"" is an entire life-cycle in eight minutes. Over his career, both in Fuck Buttons and as a solo artist, Power's music has been an exercise in the sweeping emotional and physical power of sound itself. Fuck Buttons may be unlikely stars, but their music's pure momentum almost guaranteed its audience by force alone. Like Power's best work, <i>Dumb Flesh</i> moves you when it literally <i>moves you.</i></p></div>"|20459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20459-dumb-flesh/|7.6|Nathan Reese

Boothe’s <a href=""https://knxwledge.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp page</a> boasts more than 60 projects—<a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/read/youneedtohearthis-touching-bass-knxwledge"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""light work""</a> by his standards—each one made of deconstructed soul samples and thumping drums.</p>
<p>While it’s probably too easy to compare Boothe with hip-hop producers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>, the similarities are glaring: Dilla’s voice is heard throughout Boothe’s new album, <i>Hud Dreems</i>; the music is wonky and off-kilter, much like Madlib’s output, though Boothe’s version is more organized. The man himself is quiet and reserved. While he rarely gives interviews, in April, he <a href=""http://www.passionweiss.com/2015/04/21/im-just-numb-to-surprises-an-interview-with-knxwledge/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> <i>Passion of the Weiss</i> that he grew up in church and recorded sermons as a child. ""I was trying to grab everything I could grab, you know?"" Boothe said. ""For the most part, I was grabbing oldies on the radio when I couldn’t be at home. And when I wasn’t home, I would leave that shit recording, like when I had to go to church or something. Just leave that going so when I come back I have something to chop.""</p>
<p>So, in a way, Boothe’s been perfecting his craft since childhood. That quote explains the scenic aspects of the producer’s music, and why he opts for dusty field recordings in lieu of modern-day gloss. Boothe is an old soul. Given his work thus far, it’s clear he’s in it for the long haul. Boothe isn’t here to blow up from one song; he’s looking to build a lasting legacy one beat at a time. <i>Hud Dreems</i> is a 26-track collection of short-bursting vignettes and random vocal clips. It’s constructed as a beat tape largely devoid of standout songs, an efficient suite of head-nodding instrumentals keeping an upbeat pace. Many of these tracks barely pass the one-minute mark. They’re sequenced without breaks for a seamless listening experience.</p>
<p>Given <i>Butterfly</i>’s success, <i>Hud Dreems</i> presents Boothe to a bigger audience, though the sounds contained here are typical for the Los Angeles resident. Boothe takes seemingly disparate sounds and blends them into wobbly, Cali-infused compositions. He pulls largely familiar tones—a well-known song or identifiable voice, for example—and remixes them into off-kilter melodies. That approach makes the music feel accessible, even if the time signatures are clearly out of whack. Across several releases, Boothe has flipped countless musicians—<a href=""https://knxwledge.bandcamp.com/track/6-wunmoarchance-kldallbghtr"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Biggie</a>, <a href=""https://knxwledge.bandcamp.com/track/4-luchini-twrk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Camp Lo</a>, and <a href=""https://knxwledge.bandcamp.com/track/10-devilspy-kaleries"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">D’Angelo</a>, among others—into his own mix of cosmic soul. The same goes for <i>Hud Dreems</i>: On ""jstowee"", we hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"">Erykah Badu</a> coo softly amongst the track’s stampeding bluster. There are two unmistakable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"">Nas</a> clips—one on ""letuleave.[geekdop]"" that borrows the intro of the rapper’s ""Money Is My Bitch"", the other on ""faraway"" that samples a Nas dialogue from 1998 movie <i>Belly</i>. Havoc (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"">Mobb Deep</a>) drifts easily, his sampled line from ""Win or Lose"" working as an indirect mission statement for Boothe: ""My destination’s the top of the world.""</p>
<p>By definition, <i>Hud Dreems</i> is an instrumental release, yet the producer skillfully arranges these verbal fragments to liven the procession. In doing so, the album breezes through golden-era rap and R&amp;B while remaining very much in the now. It properly showcases Boothe’s wide-ranging sonic palate and offers a hearty glimpse into musical yesteryear. As a result, <i>Hud Dreems</i> feels remarkably nostalgic. It’s a fully realized effort, bridging a gap between older and younger listeners, and serving as a nice starting point for new Knxwledge consumers. If Kendrick brought you here, <i>Hud Dreems</i> will make you stay for a while.</p></div>"|20510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20510-hud-dreems/|7.2|Marcus J. Moore

At least Catfish &amp; the Bottlemen reach for the sky (or Glastonbury's main stage) as they're scraping the barrel. Perhaps it's a symptom of having been the barometer/straw men of the Great British Music Press Hype Machine (the sheer fact of which seems to prime the nation's indie bands for America's contempt): retreat before you get replaced.</p>
<p>Reviews of Palma Violets' 2013 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17731-palma-violets-180/""><i>180</i></a>, lambasted fickle British music magazines for telling teenagers that the all-male London four-piece were the next big thing (what a crime), while conceding that the record's punch-drunk mix of Gun Club swagger and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"">the Clash</a>'s more jovial insurrection was actually alright. On <i>Danger in the Club</i>, Palma Violets have willfully regressed, from punk to pub-rock—or ""pre-punk"", as they've been calling it. Spearheaded by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Feelgood_%28band%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Feelgood</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinsley_Schwarz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brinsley Schwarz</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_and_the_Hot_Rods"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eddie and the Hot Rods</a>, pub rock was a reaction against prog, glam, and bands ascending to theater venues that priced out their early supporters. The genre was quickly trumped by punk proper, and doesn't have a lot of cachet today.</p>
<p>Palma Violets have talked about briefly hating each other by the end of the tour for their debut album, and having no ideas for their second as recently as midway through 2014. <i>180</i> wasn't original, but it had energy and high stakes on its side: its youthful relationships were either world-beating or the end of the world, and the nonsensical titles/lyrics (""Johnny Bagga' Donuts"", ""Chicken Dippers"") hinted at a wealth of winking in-jokes between besotted friends. The band members are only now in their very early 20s, but the mood on <i>Danger in the Club</i> is misanthropic, tired of life and home and girls. ""I would rather die than be in love"", the band's other vocalist, Chilli Jesson, sings on ""Coming Over To My Place"", a dissolute memory of the melody to the Cure's ""Friday I'm in Love"". With the help of a supporting gang, he sings the line over and over, in a state of forced triumphant collapse that just seems sad.</p>
<p><i>Danger in the Club</i> is beset by a powerful sense of dread, but there's little effort in Palma Violets' performance, despite their claims that producer John Leckie drilled them to extremes. (It's worth remembering that after an uninspired debut, he helped tease <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/""><i>The Bends</i></a> out of an equally mixed-up young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>, who came to him, as Palmas did, for his work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7616-magazine/"">Magazine</a>'s 1978 album, <i>Real Life</i>.) They wanted to retain the quality of their early demos, but the boggy result lacks the debut's clarity. The bottom end bludgeons and their surf guitars are sloppy, the band playing like drunken British seaside pier entertainers reduced to grabbing from their '00s forebears. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"">Interpol</a>'s self-pitying specter looms on the dismal ambience of ""No Money Honey"" and the moronic, Byronic ""Matador"". ""Secrets of America"" rips off the returning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2471-the-libertines/"">Libertines</a>' shambolic rockers without any of their heart, and ""The Jacket Song"" sounds conspicuously like Doherty and co's lovely ballad ""Radio America"". </p>
<p>For their many faults, the Libertines, Palmas' Rough Trade forebears, had astute things to say about British class and society. The main lyrical takeaway from <i>Danger in the Club</i> is that Jesson and Fryer are dreadful poets, attempting to pass off misery as depth and exhibiting a noxious distaste for the women that have left them, or deigned to try and love them. The record opens with an iPhone recording of the owners of the Welsh studio they recorded in singing ""Sweet Violets"", a comic traditional about how women are only interested in a man's money. Where the Palmas mythologized girls on <i>180</i>, here they're a nuisance or wearying source of pain at best, <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slapper"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slappers</a> (the title track) at worst, something to be stepped on to feel better. ""We'll probably burn out and fail"", Fryer and Jesson sing on ""Girl, You Couldn't Do Much Better on the Beach"". ""Well, at least I was a marvelous failure/ You'll be like the rest… a nonsensical benign success!""</p>
<p>In a recent <i>NME</i> <a href=""http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/general-election-2015-muse-noel-gallagher-savages-du-blonde-ghetts-and-more-on-politics-and-protest#lVSIY4XyjUF2QY77.99"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">feature</a> that gauged political feeling among bands in the run-up to the UK general election, Jesson, said that Palma Violets had ""tried to consciously not be political"" on their second album. (It's hard to believe they tried much at all.) ""<span style=""background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);"">Everything is so fucking politically correct at the moment that if you say something out of line it's almost like you're trying to provoke something</span>,"" he said, risibly. A charitable perspective might see the band's embrace of pub rock as a conscious rejection of political correctness in the form of so-called good taste; the reality is that it seems like a last-ditch attempt to aestheticize a sublime lack of inspiration.</p></div>"|20423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20423-danger-in-the-club/|4.5|Laura Snapes

(Dessner and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> instrumentalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32312-richard-reed-parry/"">Richard Reed Parry</a> are even working on a collaborative piece for the New York Philharmonic, to be played late in 2015.) But how many of these hybrid-genre composer-performers have actually thrown over the alt-career entirely, in order to make notated music an essentially full-time creative pursuit?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Tyondai Braxton is the lone brave soul in that regard, going back to his triumphant solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13472-central-market/""><i>Central Market</i></a>—a ripping and riff-heavy collaboration with the Wordless Music Orchestra, released on <a href=""http://warp.net/artists/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp Records</a> in 2009 (while he was still a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"">Battles</a>). At the time, the record signaled Braxton's growing restlessness inside the math-rock and indie scenes. Since that statement of purpose, though, his discography has grown at noticeably gradual pace. He wrote a short piece for an avant-garde marching band (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiVb1i3QSoI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pulse March""</a>), contributed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14203-rubric-tyondai-braxton-remix/""><span>a track</span></a> to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a> remix album (and collaborated onstage with the legendary composer), while occasionally playing a variety of glitzy gigs (often involving improvisation) in and around Brooklyn.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The highest-profile of these performances was the 2013 debut, at the Guggenheim Museum, of Braxton's HIVE project: a multimedia extravaganza described in promotional materials as ""part architectural installation and part ensemble performance with five musicians sitting cross-legged atop their own space-age oval pods."" In more down-to-earth terms, Braxton had conceived of a percussion-meets-electronic music piece. After some positive <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/arts/music/hive-by-tyondai-braxton-at-the-guggenheim.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>live reviews</span></a>—and additional performances in other locations—the <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nonesuch</a> label has now released a 42-minute version of the work, titled <i>HIVE1</i>, which was recorded over a two-year span.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I didn't catch the live iteration, and so can't speak to its success as a multimedia affair—but as a home-listening experience, <i>HIVE1</i> is intriguing, fitfully exciting, and also sometimes a letdown. In combining an evident love for the percussion works of 20th-century modernist composers like Edgard Varèse with his own prodigious beat-making skills, Braxton has created an eight-movement suite that sounds not terribly different from what you'd get if you built a playlist in which <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QmD6qfHDxQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Karlheinz Stockhausen's ""Zyklus""</a> bumps up against <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"">Boredoms</a> remixes by Yamantaka Eye. Sufficiently avant, to be sure, but also a little ragged at its edges.</p>
<p>""Gracka"" kicks things off with a promising arpeggiated digital riff, before hand-clappy syncopations join in, halfway through the three-minute running time. Later, a brief, stereo-panned chordal vista hints at some grand, possibly-orchestral designs—right before the track peters out. The eight-minute ""Boids"" follows, and its disconnected swirls of percussion make for <i>HIVE1</i>'s most aimless stretch. It's not that sparse percussive music can't hold one's interest as a general rule (as the absurdist and entertaining theatrics of composer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Kagel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mauricio Kagel</a>'s music demonstrates). But on my initial <i>HIVE1</i> listens, I grew impatient every time, right around here. Was this surround-sound, live-at-the-Guggenheim production not going to quite translate as a two-channel headphone-trip?</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Thankfully, it</span><span>'</span><span>s on </span><span>""</span><span>Studio Mariacha</span><span>""—</span><span>with its plush waves of digitally warbling, video-game-style exhalations</span><span>—</span><span>that </span><i>HIVE1</i><span> takes off for real. The following number, ""Amlochey"", announces a steady groove, straight away, and features some bell-like digital timbres that carry a hint of melody, too. </span><span>And the lengthy closer, ""Scout 1"", is everything you could want from this project: drum-circle bliss, grizzled low-end, oscillating counterpoint in the upper pitch registers, and a potent cluster chord that someone in the ensemble leans on a few times during the final seconds. A surprising, ecstatic triumph</span><span>—</span><span>and then it</span><span>'</span><span>s all done.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Overall, it's clear that <i>HIVE1</i> doesn't manage to engage all of its composer's talents, despite its occasionally locked-in blend of notated percussion parts and sharp electro-production. This judgment is especially difficult to avoid given that another one-off piece of Braxton's, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfubb0PutYc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Casino Trem""</a>, has also made its way to market on the same release date. Written for the new-classical players in the group that is (somewhat awkwardly) named <a href=""http://bangonacan.org/bang_on_a_can_all_stars"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Bang on a Can All-Stars</a>—and appearing on that group's latest album,<i> Field Recordings</i>—""Casino Trem"" contains some <i>HIVE1</i>-style beat programming, but also a post-minimalist electric guitar part that recalls the most rousing moments of <i>Central Market</i>. Braxton's seven-minute contribution climaxes with a rave-up section that pairs a mournful clarinet line with jaunty samples that sound like they were recorded outside a local carnival's funhouse. It's weird, dark and fun all at once. In short, it shows an exciting way forward, whereas <i>HIVE1</i> can't quite shake the feeling that it was best experienced live.</p></div>"|20462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20462-hive1/|6.9|Seth Colter Walls

Which is to say, there’s a mint to be had in mining the sound of early '80s R&amp;B, boogie, and electro-funk right now, whether you take your cues from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gap_Band"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Gap Band</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29394-chic/"">Chic</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=919Gt1SczVY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Morris Day and the Time’s ""Jungle Love""</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_%28Michael_Jackson_album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Thriller</i></a>. By such a metric, Baltimore-born, Sheffield-based producer and house-music veteran Maurice Fulton should be a multi-platinum artist and in-demand producer for big artists.</p>
<p>But in reality, Fulton remains a hard-to-pin figure in the deep house underground, avoiding big festival stages, dropping album-length releases without notice and eschewing publicity, media and interview requests. Two-plus decades into his music-making career, he does whatever he damned well pleases. The past three years have seen Fulton release an album under the guise of a Finnish jazz trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13621-syclops/"">Syclops</a>, a set of tough house productions to back a powerful Swahili singer Mim Suleiman, a sensuous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14481-the-fall-maurice-fulton-alt-mix/"">remix</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"">Rhye</a>, a twisted EP with Japanese icon DJ Nori, and a third album from Fulton with his wife Mu (under her full name Mutsumi). Almost all of them were quick blips on the dance music landscape, some of them released only digitally via his BubbleTease Communications label.</p>
<p>Two months ago, one of Fulton’s many guises, Boof (a project which seems preoccupied with flowers of all varieties), appeared seemingly overnight with the release of <i>The Hydrangeas Whisper</i>. This one gets a physical release this week courtesy of <a href=""http://running-back-records.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Running Back</a>, giving fans a slightly more tenable grasp on one of dance music’s most elusive figures. Like a bumblebee in a botanical garden, Boof finds Fulton alighting on many different sounds, never quite settling into any one. </p>
<p>In the past, Boof reveled in Fulton’s jazz side, and this album is no different. ""Intro to It's Sunny S Outside"" sounds like it borrowed the drum machine from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDD5BQlv8iw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">George McRae’s ""Rock Your Baby""</a> and added a George Benson guitar figure, resulting in a swirling Balearic number. Then Fulton does his one-man ""Get Lucky"" robot band on ""Birgit Boogie"", a grid of go-go bells, hand drums and closed hi-hats. Nagging clean guitar upstrokes and champagne-bubble synths give the track an airiness that counterbalances the fat, wobbling bassline underneath. ""Just on the Swings"" imagines Nile Rodgers’ guitar lines atop a SAM Records’ groove before stomping on the overdrive and flange pedal.</p>
<p>But from there, Fulton becomes a bit restless. The title track recreates the sort of inert, hissing ambience of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5821-wolfgang-voigt/"">Wolfgang Voigt</a>’s GAS project, and the suspended synth chords of ""Cat Soulcat Strut"", sounds like an imagined sweet spot between the Gap Band’s 1984 hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17lkdqoLt44"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Dropped a Bomb on Me""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfPcF-sBOD0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Go Bang #5""</a>. The album veers into clanging metallic minimal techno accompanied by furious Cuban hand drums, to arcade blips dumped into a '90s house track, to a swing number on ""Emi's M"" not unlike a robot jazz ensemble tackling ""Take Five"". These jumps might derail another album, but as is always the case with Fulton’s productions, he has a singular talent for making the most idiosyncratic and random of sounds seem natural.</p></div>"|20579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20579-the-hydrangeas-whisper/|7.0|Andy Beta

The Omaha trio's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16830-icky-blossoms/"">self-titled 2012 debut</a> was beholden to the rigid, impersonal conventions of electroclash, even when it seemed as if the group's interests lay elsewhere. There were moments where the band's primary singer Sarah Bohling in particular sounded as if she longed to emote, but she restrained herself, because genre protocol dictated she remain as dispassionate as the sequenced pulses behind her. </p>
<p>On Icky Blossoms' sophomore album <i>Mask</i>, Bohling recasts herself as a real, vulnerable human being. Though the band still draws from the same pool of '80s synth-pop, dance, and electro-rock, they've replaced the aura of debauched sex that hung over their first album with a sweeter, more romantic focus. That retool is underscored by the change in producers. For their debut, Icky Blossoms recruited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>'s Dave Sitek, who manned the boards as if wearing surgical gloves, but on <i>Mask</i> they partner with a collaborator closer to home, <a href=""http://saddle-creek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saddle Creek</a> standby Mike Mogis, a producer who isn't shy about leaving fingerprints.<br> <br> Mogis has some experience with electro-pop, with credits on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1438-the-faint/"">the Faint</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2952-wet-from-birth/""><i>Wet From Birth</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"">Bright Eyes</a>' glitchy one-off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/""><i>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</i></a>, but generally he doesn't do genre exercises. His specialty is albums that sound unmistakably like Saddle Creek albums—snug, vividly colored records that play as if crafted by a bunch of friends squeezing into a studio on a night off and helping each other out. <i>Mask</i> fits that mold, with contributions from a half dozen or so players from the usual circles, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/874-cursive/"">Cursive</a>'s Patrick Newbery, who plays trumpet on a track, and the Faint's Todd Fink, who lends some additional production and earns an especially warm thank-you in the liner credits (""Your knowledge of electricity is invaluable and your dog is awesome."")<br> <br> At its best, <i>Mask</i> captures the spirit of the label's heyday records. With its squealing guitars and manic tempo, ""Phantasmagoria"" channels the vicious side of the Faint's miswired electro-punk, while the record's catchiest single, ""Living in Fiction"", elbows its way toward one of those generous, jubilant choruses that used to leap so effortlessly off of Bright Eyes albums. And Bohling even sounds like a typical Saddle Creek protagonist now. She sings opener ""In Folds"" as a prolonged sigh, her voice quivering with echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6908-conor-oberst/"">Conor Oberst</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6113-jenny-lewis/"">Jenny Lewis</a>. <i>Mask</i>'s songs often place her in the same position those label luminaries used to write from, unable to shake the traumas of past relationships and unsure of her ability to secure future ones. ""I get so trapped in my head sometimes I turn what I love into a monster,"" she laments on ""The Spiral"". <br> <br> Though it lacks the sparkle of some of the album's snappier electro-pop numbers, one of <i>Mask</i>'s most lasting songs is also its most naked. On ""Want You So Bad"", the band dials down the synths to a murmur, accentuating Bohling's loneliness with some barren guitar strums as she pines for a lost love. ""I let go for you,"" she sings, ""Forever I've been waiting now."" It's a decidedly un-showy track for a band that usually prefers very showy sounds, and it probably would have brought the band's <i>chic</i> debut album to a halt. But it slots in comfortably on <i>Mask</i>, a follow-up that finds Icky Blossoms letting their guard down and embracing the values of their music scene, where there's no higher form of fashion than wearing your heart on your sleeve.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|20524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20524-mask/|6.8|Evan Rytlewski

Both under the Depressedly banner, which also includes multi-instrumentalist Delaney Mills as a permanent member, and his solo project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28621-coma-cinema/"">Coma Cinema</a>, Cothran has built an expansive discography that leans heavily toward the downcast. But this time around, Cothran hints early on that things are going to be different and they largely are. For <i>New Alhambra</i>, his seventh and latest release as Elvis Depressedly, he's crafted a utopian sort of indie-pop, an ecstatic evocation of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the second coming</a>, professional wrestling, and radical positivity.</p>
<p>It's been a long journey to this point for the South Carolina-born Cothran. As a fiercely independent home-recording apologist, his efforts have always been aided—or hamstrung—by whatever half-broken equipment he could get his hands on the moment the songs started pouring out. In leaner times, this often meant that his releases were unapologetically lo-fi, a quirk of his work that cut both ways. When outlining quiet despair, the grit and grime functions as a poignant mirror for his work, but on more buoyant numbers the nuances—the comedy and uplift that he often seeks to convey—could get lost in the muddle. So to hear him proclaim, less than five minutes into his newest record, that those gloomier moments had been excised could have been cause for concern.</p>
<p>But with the exception of Coma Cinema's 2013 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18120-coma-cinema-posthumous-release/""><i>Posthumous Release</i></a>, recorded in Los Angeles with production help from local band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29266-tv-girl/"">TV Girl</a>, <i>New Alhambra</i> is his most traditionally well-produced record. Cothran's guitars roil and collapse with a multi-dimensional shimmer and Mills' keyboard parts are given body and voice that would've been impossible on the crackly Elvis Depressedly recordings of the past. With such a solid production backline, Cothran's given room to experiment more than he ever has before. He coats vocals in idiosyncratic, nauseous chorus effects (""Ease""), scatters pitch shifted vocals throughout, and even manages to squeeze in a reversed guitar solo for good measure (""New Heaven, New Earth""). Cothran and Mills achieve a textural depth that's rare for songwriters in this lane. There's far more corners to explore than on, say, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31136-jackson-scott/"">Jackson Scott</a> record, but they also manage not to overcomplicate things and ruin the unique magic of the brittle aesthetic.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine a more perfect vehicle for Cothran's wholehearted embrace of optimism. He explicitly invokes the Bible on a number of occasions throughout the record, but when he does so it's only to underline themes of rebirth. He proves that he can write with delicacy about joy and love and light just as easily as he can about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyP3ND7Xm4A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Satan</a> and <a href=""https://comacinema.bandcamp.com/track/burn-a-church"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">burning churches</a>. On ""N.M.S.S."", he proclaims that he ""love[s] everyone that [he has] ever known"" and he ""go[es] to sleep still believing"" in an abstract ""someday"" that might come for him. It's a plain little sentiment, but it works with what's around it. Watery guitars and plodding kick drums open up and buoy his open-hearted vocal. He's happy, if only intermittently. And unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a>'s catchy, dead-eyed assertion of the same, Cothran's musical encapsulation of the feeling is even-keeled and aqueous—true to the hesitant hopefulness that can follow in the wake of overwhelming depression.</p>
<p>But maybe that's the fleeting feeling Cothran has been trying to get at all along. He's <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/excusive-song-premiere-and-interview-no-more-sad-songs-elvis-depressedly"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> that those who weep while listening to his songs are doing the equivalent of ""crying [while] watching 'Looney Tunes' or something."" That sells short the fragile honesty of his work, but it speaks to the triumph of <i>New Alhambra</i>'s overall enterprise, that such an assertion finally makes sense. For the first time, we can laugh right along with him.</p></div>"|20485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20485-new-alhambra/|7.3|Colin Joyce

It praises their current efforts by way of dismissing the steps they took to arrive at that destination. In that regard, Coliseum's progression over the course of 12 years and five full-lengths has been less an exercise in growing up and more one of ""growing in"" to a sound, one that hits its highest point on their newest album <i>Anxiety's Kiss, </i>which<i> </i>sharpens all of their musical developments into their finest point yet. The result is a pop-savvy sound that 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17940-coliseum-sister-faith/""><i>Sister Faith</i></a> only hinted at. </p>
<p>In the relatively short amount of time of the group's existence, Coliseum has made the label rounds, releasing all but two of their records on different labels. This might be a trivial observation for other bands, but it's been a continual point of distinction for the Kentucky-based three-piece, with each album moving in a pointedly different direction than its predecessor while keeping a rock-solid punk-rock ethos at their base. Beneath every shift, vocalist/guitarist and founding member Ryan Patterson barked his lyrics with absolute fervor and passion.</p>
<p>While their punk roots remain wholly intact, the band has grown into a comfortable but still-powerful force. Much of that growth can be attributed to bassist Kayhan Vaziri and drummer Carter Wilson, both relatively recent additions to the band who have proven invaluable in fleshing out the band's sound. Paired with Wilson's straightforward, loosely executed rhythmic style, Vaziri's bass works as much melodic nuance into the songs as Patterson's guitar.</p>
<p><i>Anxiety's Kiss</i> wastes no time in announcing its intentions with the radio-ready ""We Are the Water"", a pop-punk anthem owing as much to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"">the Replacements</a> as it does to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up"">Fucked Up</a>, complete with gang-vocal refrain. The post-punk-tinged followup ""Dark Light of Seduction"" chases the immediacy with a slow burning churn, and a subdued layer of electronic noise that the band has folded into their mix over the last two albums. This muted sense of nuance is what gives Coliseum's music an amorphous tendency, and while that's sometimes worked against them in the past, here it allows them to shift weightlessly from near post-rock atmospherics on the outstanding ""Dark Light of Seduction"" to blistering anthems like ""Drums &amp; Amplifiers"", all without losing a core sense of focus.</p>
<p>Just shy of 40 minutes, <i>Anxiety's Kiss</i> packs in a surprising amount of singalong hooks, and you can sense their comfort with them. They've always had these proclivities lurking in the background, and this time around they embrace them as the next logical step. For longtime followers of the band, <i>Anxiety's Kiss</i> has the feel of a logical endpoint, the latest natural development in an impressive career of progressions.</p></div>"|20414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20414-coliseum-anxietys-kiss/|7.9|Jonathan K.

Loneliness is a condition, a place you end up and from which you are eager to leave, but solitude is a choice. Like Henry James or Emily Dickinson, who best detail the workings of their mind when they are cloistered away from the world, Matsson is more concerned with a wellspring of autonomous thought rather than the chirpings of modern society. His voice and his guitar jig around some distant forest maypole, out of touch and out of sync with everything 21st-century. Instead, he's loosely moored to his dreams, his wanderlust, and all the other broad stuff of poetry that glows brightest in total seclusion.</p>
<p>It used to be easy to hear this solitude in Matsson's music. His first few albums featured only his rich, bleating voice and his acoustic guitar, and listening to his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11359-shallow-graves/"">early records</a> can feel like hearing someone rediscover the unfettered joy of playing music in real time. Naturally, for the last few albums, Matsson has been adding tiny layers of instrumentation behind him and the fire of his early days has dwindled into the mist of the songs' arrangements.<i> Dark Bird Is Home</i>, his first album since 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16711-theres-no-leaving-now/""><i>There's No Leaving Now</i></a>, continues in this vein, and Matsson's persona fades even more into the tapestry he's made with his music.</p>
<p>Matsson handles most of the performances, including keyboards and drums. He has some extra players—most notably background vocals and strings from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>'s Mike Noyce—to fill the songs out, but the majority of the starry musical textures are Matsson's. He recorded the album in odd places in his native Sweden and surrounding countries, and the dusting of synths, pedal steel, french horns and trumpets on the album say a lot by saying very little. ""Timothy"" turns on a winsome clarinet figure played by Matsson, and it's the perfect amount of simplicity to ornament his songs without upsetting the whole equation. Matsson still hasn't ""gone electric,"" and blessedly still avoids the MOR folk-rock tropes of stomping and big-ticket whoa-oh'ing. Behind all the arrangements, front and center on every track, is still his voice.</p>
<p>That voice undersells nothing: There are no wanly delivered lines, no flat and dour stretches of singing. His voice is prismatic, used like an old-guard storyteller who hews his words to any kind of feeling he wants. He does bittersweet reassurance on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59259-the-tallest-man-on-earth-shares-dark-bird-is-home/"">stunning title track</a>, and the way he tip-toes down the phrase ""Still we're in the light of day"" is hypnotic. He does sockless campfire guy on ""Beginners"", a song so whimsical it could land a three-movie deal with Disney. He even does the soft-rocking-through-the-sadness on ""Sagres"", where whispers for the audience to ""come on"" at the end of the chorus feel like the coyest Bruce Springsteen impression in history. Words come out of his mouth brimming with so much emotion, they land <i>just</i> shy of over-singing.</p>
<p>Matsson has always been a little obtuse with his lyrics, and that can be charming or intriguing: The ballad ""Little Nowhere Towns"" is Matsson half-drunkenly retelling a tale of heartbreak, languishing in the imagery, nearly impossible to pin down. There's some bitterness about his own songwriting, perhaps: ""And I'm racing through my pockets now/ 'Cause I'm starting to believe/ Selling emptiness to strangers/ A little bit warmer than my dreams.""</p>
<p>Elsewhere he's more inscrutable. The chorus of ""Singers"" goes ""But we're only gone like singers are till springtime/ Let them out, if they should let them out,"" which never opens up on repeated listens to reveal more than a tangle of words. The big choruses feel undercut by the sometimes-tangled poetry of the words, which get lost in metaphor en route to making their point. On ""Sagres"", he cuts through all the artifice with a striking moment: ""It's just all this <i>fucking</i> doubt,"" he sings, barely squeezing out the line. It feels like everything he's been trying and failing to say elsewhere.</p>
<p>Which is why Matsson seems like someone who writes songs for himself alone. There's plenty of second-person on the record—a ""you"" who he walked some trails with, a ""you"" he's letting go of—but these are songs too caustic and bittersweet to be odes. If his last record was about putting down roots, here he's picking them back up again. It is his most personal record, but not because it's bare and raw, but because it's surreal and dreamlike. He flits between our reality and his own, a world of only dreamers and travelers, flickering lights of towns, shadows and ghosts, birds and trees. It's his way finding joy in his solitude.</p></div>"|20481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20481-dark-bird-is-home/|6.7|Jeremy D. Larson

Back in 2010, Florida’s Surfer Blood were riding high on the success of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13844-astro-coast/""><i>Astro Coast</i></a> (deservedly so, considering how great that record is. Go back and listen to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVkgNPK8EQE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Swim""</a> to jog your memory). A year later, the band released an EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15962-tarot-classics/""><i>Tarot Classics</i></a>, and busied themselves with endless touring, including a dream stint opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">the Pixies</a>. Though they just seemed like a bunch of kids from Florida, the band—in particular frontman and primary songwriter John Paul Pitts—ripped like an heir apparent for the guitar-pop throne previously kept warm by the likes of Stephen Malkmus or Rivers Cuomo.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not to be. In 2012, just before the recording of the band’s major label debut, Pitts was arrested (though never officially charged) after a physical altercation with his then girlfriend. Though details of the events of that night remain vague (you can read Pitts’ statement on the incident at the band’s <a href=""http://www.surferblood.com/page-jp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>), the fallout from the arrest (and the seemingly endless amount of online discussion that ensued) did irrevocable damage. As a result, 2013’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18123-surfer-blood-pythons/""><i> Pythons</i></a> seemed to emerge from under a dark cloud—a fraught, anxious record that, whether intentional or not, played out like an anguished mea culpa. A year after its release, the band was dropped from Warner Brothers. The future seemed nothing if not uncertain.</p>
<p>So now, some five years after their debut, Surfer Blood return with <i>1000 Palms, </i>a record that tries (and occasionally succeeds) at recapturing the messy exuberance of their debut. Self-recorded by the band largely in the living room of drummer Tyler Schwarz' parents’ house (and later nicely mixed by Rob Schnapf), the record is not only surprisingly upbeat, but surprisingly clean-sounding as well. Freed from the constraints of a major label (""We weren’t better off in paradise/ All we ever got were parasites"" remarks Pitts on ""Dorian"") the band take advantage of their newfound autonomy to unpack some of the psychic trauma they've endured over the past few years. And while one might expect this to be an opportunity for some cathartic guitar shredding, <i>1000 Palms</i> is a little short on the epic riffs and the earworm hooks of earlier albums, in favor of tastefully employed synths and an overabundance of blandly pretty mid-tempo tracks, which, while never terrible, still feel oddly muted.</p>
<p>The first five tracks establish a kind of emotional palette that, taken on their own, would make for a killer EP. Album opener ""Grand Inquisitor"" is big and booming—packed with the kind of guitar squalling and turn-on-a-dime signature changes that could almost pass for an old Pale Saints track (it helps that Pitt’s voice is a dead ringer for Pale Saints’ Ian Masters)—and evidences the kind of dynamic that made early Surfer Blood records fun. ""You wrote the finest record I’d ever heard,"" sings Pitt, ""It never occurred that you’d rather throw it all away/ Launch the CD-R into the bay."" On ""Island"" Pitt details a kind of creative discontent that pops up again and again on <i>Palms</i>: ""A shadow fell on me today/ It paralyzed my tongue, eclipsed my brain"" while the guitars morph from overdriven fuzz into melodic lines reminiscent of early-'80s new wave.</p>
<p>The album's poppiest moments are often married to Pitt’s most pained sentiments, as on ""Feast/Famine"" where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4425-unrest/"">Unrest</a>-like guitar jangle is set against Pitt’s own self-doubt: ""Sometimes I feel out touch with who I am/ I can’t see no symmetry/ It’s feast or famine."" <i>1000 Palms</i> vacillates between songs about frustration and songs about love, which themselves run the gamut from endearingly sweet (the gorgeous New Year’s Eve romance of ""I Can’t Explain"") to the treacly and forgettable. <i>1000 Palms</i> is consistently lovely and never terribly misfires, but in its same-sounding second half you can't help but wish it fired at least a little harder.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>1000 Palms</i> sounds like emotional throat-clearing, the transitional sound of a band finding their bearings, resetting their dials, and getting back on their feet in the wake of a lot of personal and professional turmoil. One would hope this would prove to be a pivotal turning point for the group, but the recent news of guitarist Thomas Fekete’s illness (he’s been diagnosed with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59346-surfer-blood-guitarist-thomas-fekete-diagnosed-with-cancer/"">rare form of cancer</a>) seems yet another blow to the now-beleaguered band. <i>1000 Palms</i> does an admirable job of squaring itself with the past, as evidenced on album closer ""NW Passage""—an acoustic missive about breaking through impossible frozen barriers, forgiving and forgetting, and learning to get up again after falling face-first in the mud—but it ultimately all feels a bit tepid and desperately polite. Make no mistake, it’s all good, this business of letting go of bad baggage, but now that they’ve done so, here’s hoping Surfer Blood are more willing to stick their necks out next time and jump headlong back into the fray.</p></div>"|20586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20586-1000-palms/|6.6|T.

The band founded Brooklyn songwriting and art collective <a href=""http://theepochisnow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Epoch</a> in 2011 along with several of their friends, but this sense of mutual support and do-it-together philosophy has long been a part of Smith's M.O. She originally formed Eskimeaux in 2007, all the while happily joining her peers' and fellow collective members' bands—<a href=""http://bellows.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bellows</a>, <a href=""https://toldslant.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Told Slant</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos/"">Frankie Cosmos</a>. Smith's songs reflect this type of profound concern for the well-being of those around her, an eagerness to take a backseat when others need her and a longing to still express her own sharp meditations on love and loneliness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Several of the songs on </span><i>O.K.</i><span> are new versions of previous recordings, but this time around Smith has scaled back to outline each melody in clearer brush strokes. Where certain tracks on 2013's </span><a href=""https://eskimeaux.bandcamp.com/album/igluenza"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Igluenza</i></a><span> were monotone or drawn out, they graduate to fully formed pop on this release. Before, ""I Admit I'm Scared"" felt flat despite its visually compelling lyrics (""Everything I said spewed like sparklers from my mouth/ They looked pretty as they flew but now they're useless and burnt out""), while here it's one of the album's strongest moments. Subtle harmonies slowly coax Smith's gentle alto into a confident soar over Felix Walworth's galloping drum fill. She casually divulges secrets as though her arm is already on your shoulder, her quiet relatability spiking upwards at the climax (""If I had a dime for every time I'm freaking out/ We could fly around the world or just get out of your parents' house"").</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This encouraging, comforting voice permeates </span><i>O.K.</i><span> It may not always come in the form of a soft whisper in the night, but somehow it feels as if Smith is lending her ear to you rather than the other way around. Whether she's letting you know that it's okay to be scared and sad—notably on danceable bedroom pop number ""Alone at the Party""—or tenderly confessing how important you are (""The Thunder Answered Back""), the sweetness isn't saccharine, it's sincere and intimate. And when the entire band accompanies Smith on the latter track, she serves gut-wrenching doses of candor: ""It must feel like fucking hell/ To be a patchwork of yourself."" Smith is a hyper-aware observer, able to pinpoint others' despair just as well as her own.</span></p>
<p>Sonically, <i>O.K.</i> is the most fitting pallette for Smith's work. In the past she's played around with drum machines and broken synth beats, which weighed her down in gloomy, droning noise. This LP finally matches Eskimeaux's illuminating presence. She slips from sparse indie-folk to ethereal pop throughout the record, each arrangement rich and meticulously composed. The band never overpowers Smith's celestial vocals, and she's able to keep up with the slow-burning tension when it eventually detonates. Walworth's attentive drumming is a welcome addition that swells and retracts to complement Jack Greenleaf's twinkling synth arpeggios.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-6e2a0f1a-25c3-015a-ffdc-597689fb18b5""><span>At face value, it's easy to mistake Smith's nursery rhyme name-dropping and misty-eyed warmth for childlike naiveté. However, she's no Pollyanna—she's simply acknowledging the darkness and aiming to move past it. </span><i>O.K.</i><span> invites us to view the world through Smith's eyes. The unassuming strength of her vision is what makes that invitation so worth accepting.</span></span></p></div>"|20434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20434-ok/|7.5|Tess Duncan

<p>His second album, <i>Who Me?</i>, features 13 songs, all of which are less than three minutes long and several of which are less than two, played on about as many chords. Most of them are arranged for acoustic guitar, electric bass, and other things that can be rehearsed in the living room without bothering the neighbors. Simplicity here isn’t a matter of technical limitation but of philosophical stance: For Wauters, music stopped evolving when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a> decided mysticism was more complicated than puppy love.</p>
<p>Wauters has always seemed breezy but never quite so meek. I first encountered him as the singer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29365-the-beets/"">the Beets</a>, a bratty, separatist band whose songs were anchored by declarations so simple they sounded like Zen aphorism. (My favorite of these is still probably <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va-9e_Trs0I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""If you’re cold, get a coat,""</a> though I also get great comfort from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyHaFnvUyz0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""There’s only one horse and twenty riders/ Only one of them will get to ride it,""</a> which I take to be a metaphor for the narrow odds of success.) Whatever certainty he had has winnowed. ""I grew up thinking I’d be a hero,"" he sings on ""El Show de Los Muertos"". ""I grew up thinking I wouldn’t be them/ But what am I doing/ Here alone lost and wondering/ How many times do I have to die to be only me?""</p>
<p>Doubt is universal, but Wauters always seemed like someone able to enjoy himself in spite of it, someone who brandished his cardboard sword and charged the castle laughing. That’s him on the cover of <i>Who Me?</i>, standing on the hood of a car with the Manhattan skyline in the background, dwarfing the buildings but shying away from the camera. Later, he said he looked uncomfortable because they had to stop traffic in order to take the shot. Being in the way isn’t really his way.</p>
<p>I like Wauters; I want him to win in part because I don’t think he cares much about winning. His songs are a stay against the passage of time: Kid to adult, openness to inevitable close.

Hundreds? Thousands? Hundreds of thousands? In 1982, two aspiring singer-songwriters named David Kauffman (from Madison, N.J.) and Eric Caboor (from Burbank, Calif.) met at a venue called the Basement in Los Angeles, threw together a couple of their best tunes, pressed a couple hundred copies of a record, and then went their separate ways. Since then <span>the only album they made under their own names</span> has been consigned to estate sales and flea markets, waiting for subsequent generations of cratediggers to fish it out, dust it off, and find something that resonates across the decades.</p>
<p>Private-press records such as <i>Songs From Suicide Bridge </i>are relics of an age of physical media, but in the digital age, it’s easier than ever to get lost works back in print. Labels like <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic</a>, <a href=""http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paradise of Bachelors</a>, <a href=""http://www.numerogroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Numero Group</a>, and <a href=""http://www.delmorerecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Delmore Recordings</a> are doing the important work of unearthing these artifacts, even if the market seems to be increasingly saturated with reissues of the undiscovered and the uncelebrated, the obscure and the unconsidered. These reissues are as much about what might have been as they are about what actually was. What if <i>Songs</i> had heralded a long and prolific career instead of an obscure cratedigger treasure? What if it was the first of many albums made by Caboor and Kauffman rather than the only one?</p>
<p>In this case, I doubt their fortunes would have changed significantly—which shouldn’t be read as an insult. Caboor and Kauffman aren’t a pair of forgotten geniuses, and this new reissue flatly rejects the notion that they could have been stars: ""Fame and fortune demanded certain qualities and it became increasingly obvious that they had none,"" writes Sam Sweet in the liner notes. And yet, that only makes these songs more powerful: As its title suggests, <i>Songs From Suicide Bridge</i> is about depression and despair, about the gnawing suspicion that you don’t belong in this world, and their professional frustrations only reinforced that sense of alienation.</p>
<p>The austerity of their sound may have been a product of their limited resources—much of the album was recorded in a makeshift studio in Caboor’s backyard—but they managed to create something distinctive in its spareness, with a bit of reverb in the vocals and a crisp, at times percussive acoustic guitar sound that intensifies the songs intense isolation. <i>Songs From Suicide Bridge</i> doesn’t sound like a product of the hedonistic '80s. Instead, it seems to predict the dire introspection of the '90s. ""I have nothing but the end inside of me,"" Caboor sings on ""Angel of Mercy"", nearly a decade before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> would ride similarly dark thoughts into the mainstream.</p>
<p>As often happens with this kind of subject matter, the drama occasionally lapses into melodrama, especially on ""Life and Times on the Beach"". The song begins with Kauffman reminiscing about his childhood—playing baseball, going on family vacations—but the memories grow less sweet as he proceeds—dropping out of college, moving to L.A., getting nowhere close to realizing his dreams. As the guitars grow tenser and the pace quickens, he admits, ""What I need to end it all is right… within my reach."" You might expect to hear a gunshot or a last exhalation in the brief ellipsis, something to signal that the song and the life have ended.</p>
<p>Instead, the music starts back up again, quiet and tentative yet offering no resolution to Kauffman’s story. It’s a startling moment, yet there’s something lurid about the way it takes you right up to that life-or-death decision and just abandons you. On the other hand, it also sounds like a pivotal passage on the album, the point to which the first side of the album has been building. The intensity of that experience lends the second side a new and necessary lightness. Caboor and Kauffman play ""Midnight Willie' as a parody of coffeehouse singers, cracking up as they compare their woes to those of a crippled hobo playing for change outside the Monterey Hotel. And closer ""One More Day (You’ll Fly Again)"" expresses something in short supply on this album: actual honest-to-God hope.</p>
<p>Fortunately, neither Caboor nor Kauffman took his own life. Both of them did, however, sacrifice their dreams of stardom for less glamorous but more reliable work. So <i>Songs</i> becomes a suicide note to the music industry explaining why these two talented singer-songwriters decided to end their careers. <span>(Eventually, they did reunite in the late 1980s for a pair of album as the Drovers.) On this would-be swan song,</span> they managed to express these dire emotions with startling candor, eloquence, and directness, soundtracking their worst fears with furious acoustic strumming. Yet, the great discrepancy between their musical and their professional accomplishments lends <i>Songs From Suicide Bridge</i> a sense of gravity and impossibly high stakes, as though they knew they had only one chance to get everything right. Ultimately, the album thrives on its own obscurity, which 30 years later thrums in the background behind all that strumming.</p></div>"|20560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20560-songs-from-suicide-bridge/|7.4|Stephen M.

The first of these holds that, as a member of the studio wrecking crew that brought <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i></a> into being, this saxophonist-composer is unusually well poised to secure the attention of listeners who have previously been uninterested in jazz. (This past spring's celebration of all-things-<i>TPAB</i> was sufficiently strong that <i>Billboard</i> even <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6509665/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly-jazz-robert-glasper"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">published a well-reported piece</a> that detailed exactly how Lamar's album came to feature so many jazz figures, including Washington.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The second truth is that jazz could use a few more people with Washington's cachet in the wider world—touring with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4102-snoop-dogg/"">Snoop Dogg</a>, or putting out albums on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>' <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> imprint. Admitting this is not tantamount to saying that jazz is in some unhealthy creative state (it isn't), but rather that the music currently faces an uphill struggle in the marketplace (as it often has).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You can see hints of these outside considerations in some of the pre-release writing around </span><i>The Epic</i><span>—</span><span>virtually all of which cites Washington</span><span>'</span><span>s hip-hop associations as a reason to pay attention to his big debut as a jazz bandleader. (Washington cut one prior album </span><span>as part of a collective, in 2004, but this set is his</span><span> real coming-out party.) One can imagine other elite contemporary jazz artists grinding teeth while checking Twitter, muttering to themselves: </span><i>if anyone paid attention to me, they'd notice the post-turntablism beats in </i>my<i> music.</i></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given all this, it's something of a gobsmacking paradox to discover what a hip-hop-free zone <i>The Epic</i> is, and how enamored of jazz's past it turns out to be. This triple-album set is an extravagant love letter to (among other things): soul jazz, John Coltrane (various periods), and 1970s fusion leaders like Miles Davis and Weather Report. <i>The Epic</i>'s Disc 1 opener, ""Change of the Guard"", might as well be titled ""We Love All Kinds of 'Trane"". Its ringing opening piano chords sound almost entirely lifted from the playbook of McCoy Tyner, the pianist in Coltrane's so-called ""Classic Quartet."" (That's the group responsible for <i>A Love Supreme</i>.) The opening theme in the saxes is something that could only have been written after ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJwssBO5MQg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Impressions</a>"". And the harmonious writing for Washington's string section recalls posthumous Coltrane releases like <i>Infinity</i>—tracks from which featured orchestral overdubs supervised by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5881-alice-coltrane/"">Alice Coltrane</a> (who is, as you may have read, Flying Lotus's aunt). Toward the end of the 12-minute tune, Washington's tenor sax solo veers off into flights of screeching intensity that were the hallmark of Coltrane's later groups—specifically the ones that also included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13692-pharoah-sanders/"">Pharoah Sanders</a>. (Who is, by the way, still active—and still great, on the evidence of last year's record with the São Paulo Underground.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What <i>The Epic</i> does come to sound like, over the course of its significant running time, is a generational intervention—an educational tool that widens the definition of styles that fall under ""jazz classicism."" With his writing for string sections and chorus, Washington even flirts with that most dreaded of appellations: <i>smooth</i>. But these specific choices also wind up paying dividends: The <span>calmly spiritual voices and Washington's wailing playing </span><span>during the back half of ""Askim"" feels novel.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Three hours is a lot of music, and Washington uses the space to range freely—the R&amp;B vocals of Patrice Quinn crop up roughly once per disc, and there are long sections that feel indebted to grittier funk and soul. Washington has a healthy sense of melodrama, which is especially clear whenever the chorus s</span><span>woops in with open-hearted ""ooohs"" and ""aaahs"", aiming straight for the listener's gooseflesh.</span><span> Meantime, some of the longer, less ambitious instrumental tracks (like ""Isabelle"") play things much safer, in a kind of chill-jazz mode that features greasy-soul-organ and tasteful solos from Washington's large cast of skilled supporters (like electric bassist </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/""><span>Thundercat</span></a><span> and trombonist Ryan Porter). While faultlessly executed, these are the only moments across the music's three-hour sprawl that resemble padding. On the uptempo, high-energy music, like the updated Miles Davis-isms of ""Re Run Home"", as well the potent Disc 3 closer, ""The Message"", Washington and his band truly excel.</span></p>
<p>The big news is that <i>The Epic</i> actually makes good on its titular promise without bothering to make even a faint-hearted stab in the direction of fulfilling its pre-release hype. If you came for the hip-hop associations, and can't listen for anything else, you will surely be disappointed. But to listen like that is to cheat yourself. If you want rapping over contemporary jazz, you can find it elsewhere. If you're in the mood for acoustic adaptations of electronic-music practices, look to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28455-vijay-iyer-trio/"">Vijay Iyer Trio</a>'s recent <i>Break Stuff</i> (specifically, the track <a href=""https://vimeo.com/119620221"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hood""</a>, which is a shout-out to Detroit DJ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5751-robert-hood/"">Robert Hood</a>). You can find more studiously contemporary R&amp;B vocals on Robert Glasper's recent <i>Black Radio</i> series. Kamasi Washington's epic isn't the place for those things—though it is also a zone of surprise. Instead of a self-conscious attempt to seize someone else’s idea of the zeitgeist, it's a large and generous canvas, clearly created in the hopes of attracting new visitors to the post-Coltrane wing of the jazz museum. At this point, that project is its own form of radicalism.</p></div>"|20557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20557-the-epic/|8.6|Seth Colter Walls

In the clip, the Providence-based band outlines the realities of prison overcrowding, the racial divide in U.S. arrest rates, and the number of people killed by police—very real problems that, for many, are remarkably easy to ignore. Our screens offer countless alternatives to anything remotely ""unpleasant"" or ""depressing""; even as militarized police line city streets and 24-hour news networks, they're forced to compete with a bottomless pit of <a href=""http://fuckyeahinterspeciesfriendships.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interspecies friendship GIFs</a>. </p>
<p>Victoria Ruiz of Downtown Boys engages with the country's broken systems and the resulting frustration fuels her lyrics. The 28-year-old worked for the <a href=""http://www.ripd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rhode Island Public Defender</a>, aiming to combat racist and classist policing tactics. She currently works with <a href=""https://demandprogress.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Demand Progress</a>, and she recently wrote an <a href=""http://www.fvckthemedia.com/issue41/on-ferguson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">op-ed on Ferguson</a>. Joey L DeFrancesco, 27, was her co-worker at a hotel; they attempted to start a union since the employees <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2014/06/theme-song-downtown-boys/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">were</a>, as he described it, ""treated...like garbage."" (DeFrancesco later <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A4UGtM4hDQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quit that job with magnificent flair</a>.) ""Sometimes people ask, 'Don’t you get sad worrying about this stuff all the time?'"" Ruiz <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2014/06/theme-song-downtown-boys/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""It upsets me because it is negative and absolves the person of the responsibility of realizing that we all have to think about these things."" </p>
<p><i>Full Communism</i> is an album-length exercise of that responsibility. Downtown Boys have two horns and plenty of aggression in their arsenal and, as they play, they force you to acknowledge the world around you. The title ""Break a Few Eggs"" pretty well encapsulates the nature of the project. Songs challenge white hegemony, entitled bro culture, and more with churning rock'n'roll lined with Adrienne Berry and Emmett FitzGerald's saxophones. (Between this album and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20366-pill-ep/"">that Pill EP</a>, it's been a good year thus far for the rock sax.) DeFrancesco's guitar, Norlan Olivo's drums, and Dan Schleifer's bass lock in for a fuzzy, chugging barrage. Racism and homophobia are alluded to in shouts but the music isn't cynical; everything seems to be underpinned with the sincere desire that things actually get better. ""We make, we made, we will make freedom,"" Ruiz sings in rapid succession on ""Desde Arriba"". They've <a href=""http://www.fvckthemedia.com/issue31/fan-club"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked</a> about how they encourage a ""space of collective power"" at their live shows, which makes sense—<i>Full Communism</i>, both in message and mayhem, has the power to whip a roomful of people into a frenzy.</p>
<p>And that's the important bit—this music is saying some real shit, yeah, but it's doing it with a completely unhinged voice. As advocates of human rights, Downtown Boys are well-versed in the history of bland protest songs. ""Political music is often cheesy or boring, so no one listens to it,"" DeFrancesco has said. ""As much as we hate on aesthetics by themselves, they obviously matter."" Matching substance with style is easier said than done—Downtown Boys could easily fall into punk's trap of loud and fast monotony. They don't, though, keeping things diverse and well-sequenced. Where the horns on ""Monstro"" lend a soft, beautiful counterbalance to DeFrancesco's jagged guitar, ""Traders"" is bookended by silence and goes full speed punk at the center.</p>
<p><i>Full Communism</i>'s songs are performed in both English and Spanish—Ruiz said the band approach music <a href=""http://www.fvckthemedia.com/issue31/fan-club"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""with the intention to speak to as many people as possible.""</a> The album's last two tracks are covers—one in each language. There's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8RhLiHh5nA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Poder Elegir""</a> by Los Prisioneros, a song the Chilean band recorded as an effort to urge people to fight conformity and complacency during the rule of dictator Augusto Pinochet. The other: Bruce Springsteen's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=129kuDCQtHs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dancing in the Dark""</a>. When Ruiz shouts the Boss' world-weariness, she sounds as though she's already started a fire of her own. The covers are effective—the ideal pairing of pop infectiousness and calls to action. Downtown Boys insist that nothing's going to change unless people actually get up and do something, and they've offered a soundtrack that makes positive action feel both attainable and liberating.</p></div>"|20584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20584-full-communism/|7.6|Evan Minsker

These albums all sound very different, but they form a sort of collective statement that motherhood isn't some aesthetic, thematic or musical purgatory for women. We are not content, these working women say, on being aged out, or matron-ized, by the youth-oriented trajectory of the industry.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Man, I just delivered a nine-pound, 10-ounce baby. I'm a bad motherfucker,"" Ciara drawls on ""Jackie (B.M.F.)"", the explosive intro track on her sixth album, <i>Jackie</i>. Named after her own mother, <i>Jackie</i> doesn't necessarily shift Ciara's sound so much as a frame it with a faint redemption narrative, centered around the birth of her baby and her breakup with rapper and erstwhile ex <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>. ""You actin' like you upgrading me, I upgraded you/ You and me at Fashion Week in Paris, I put you onto that new,"" goes the album's first single, the breakup ballad <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okGcksYM0N8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Bet""</a>. But Ciara's never been much for album-length statements. Instead the ATL-reared R&amp;B pop star, best known for her sensuous, studious approach to choreography, has created a career by rewiring the city's full throttle hip-hop motifs into club-friendly pop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Jackie</i> doesn't do much to allay the feeling, which has followed her for her whole career, that there's better R&amp;B pop out there. But instead of positioning herself against <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a>—who is only just starting to really find her vocal strength, and who is decidedly not a dancer—or Beyoncé (ha ha), Ciara is content to be a reliable mainstay, a translator of Atlanta's ever-shifting avant-garde and the constant bringer of high-energy dance anthems. She's innovative within her own framework: Before Beyoncé started dabbling with bars, Ciara was already rapping on 2013's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEJTDtxYd0E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Super Turnt Up""</a> and the album-less <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a> single, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzlNPaLvVHE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wake Up, No Make-Up""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The problems with </span><i>Jackie</i><span>, a serviceable record that gets better with multiple listens, is that unlike her previous releases it's more heavily focused on paint-by-numbers Dr. Luke electro. And, an even bigger problem—and this is where Ciara has always faltered—is that it </span><span>hints at a storyline, but doesn't go deeper</span><span>. Moms totally care about more than just being moms, but consider that Ciara's records are also too often about nothing at all</span><span>, and it's hard not to wish she'd gone into more depth</span><span>. It's an opportunity and, again, on </span><span><i>Jackie</i>,</span><span> she doesn't take it. There's a song called ""Lullaby"" that's </span><span>not</span><span> about a baby but </span><span>tucking a lover in for the evening</span><span>. The actual lullaby comes toward the very end, with ""I Got You""; she sings ""Hush, Little Baby"" while Future Zahir gurgles the outro. </span></p>
<p>There are interesting moments: the hesitant merging of post-ratchet trap and drum and bass on ""B.M.F."", the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29395-nile-rodgers/"">Niles Rodgers</a>-esque retro-soul bounce of ""Kiss &amp; Tell"", and her beatific, waxy vocal performance on ""That's How I'm Feelin'"" and ""Fly"". Both are pillowy Polow Da Don electro-lite bangers—the former featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10892-pitbull/"">Pitbull</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy Elliott</a>—referencing early Ciara, like the jock-jam energy of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHNgV6_znU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""1, 2 Step""</a>. For <i>Jackie</i>'s deluxe edition, Ciara calls upon Joe Jonas to switch up the dewy, gloriously shady ""I Bet"", featuring imitation-Future yelps and adlibs. And second single ""Dance Like We're Making Love"", is a gorgeous, sleek midtempo track, similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMfPJT4XjAI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Novocane""</a> but with a bigger, airier hook.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">She carried her last album cycle off a slow jam about a very public romance (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15056-ciara-body-party/"">""Body Party""</a>), but ""I Bet"" just isn't as strong. <i>Jackie</i>'s best moments come on those Polow power jams, when the music imitates the explosiveness of Ciara's movement. What would've made <i>Jackie</i> better than the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18280-ciara-ciara/"">last album</a>—what would've given her the edge that her peers maintain—is some insight behind Ciara's redemption songs.</p></div>"|20555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20555-jackie/|6.8|Anupa Mistry

In the last several years, we've seen a daunting uptick in ""lost classics,"" freshly unearthed, which begins to generate a sort of uncanny ""How-can-this-be?"" tingle that you might recall from the deluge of posthumous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">2Pac</a> releases. There’s a fine line between ""rescued from history"" and ""dredged from oblivion,"" and with each new rarity and oddity, we’re given a chance to suss out where that line sits.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In Michael Angelo Nigro’s case, what we're being given is an interesting artifact, a pleasant record, and probably something that sounded both a little weirder and more interesting around the time it was recorded, in 1977. Nigro was a session player in Kansas City then, and he tracked the album at night and at off-hours at Liberty Recording, the studio where he worked. He was interested in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">the Byrds</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23522-cream/"">Cream</a>, and Greek mythology, and he played everything on the album except the drums. He was very clearly in his own headspace, and the record has a dreamy, unhurried feel. The label didn’t want the thing when it was done, so off he went, to a smaller studio called Big-K, which mixed and released 500 copies. The end.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Except now <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/shop/category/anthology-recordings/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anthology</a>, the offshoot of <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/home/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mexican Summer</a> devoted to reissues, has tracked down a sealed original copy and remastered it with Nigro's blessing, presenting it to us as the latest in a line of lost psych classics. It has some scruffy bonafides in this realm; it was included on the late <i>Acid Archives</i> author Patrick Lundborg’s list of his favorite private-issue albums, and 7”s of ""Sorcerer’s Delight"" can still fetch good prices on Discogs. But today, Nigro's gentle, warbly psychedelia has to fight for attention amongst similarly themed stuff being made today, on labels like <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a> and <a href=""http://www.capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>. Nigro's record might have technically been first, but since it’s being heard in context, it’s gotta wait in line, just like all the rest of us.</p>
<p>Michael Angelo Nigro’s voice is a sweet instrument, and filtered through synths and ringing open guitars on ""Flight of Pegasus"" he sounds like a romantic, unabashed in his visions of ""a sea of dreams and love"" and ""Grapes of Atlantis/ Falling from celestial vines."" The chord progressions feel bent backwards by acid, which Nigro swore he never took in a recent <a href=""http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2015/03/30/michael-angelo-the-aquarium-drunkard-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Aquarium Drunkard, and the guitar leads alternate between reminding you forcefully of George Harrison and Arthur Lee. On ""Journey (to Find Who We Are)"",  his voice sounds uncannily like early Paul Simon, and the verse melody that feels like it could be mapped onto Simon &amp; Garfunkel's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GTmN7Fhv6o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Patterns""</a> without too much deviation.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-eba40182-2f87-6e7f-7114-268425c3d457""><span>These comparisons mount over the short album’s 10 tracks, and register like little pinpricks in its aura. You might find yourself enjoying it while wondering: What is here, exactly, that can’t be found in the ocean of similar material, stretching back decades, and all of it gobbled up and apprised by thousands of psych-pop aficionados? For Nigro, who has seen his album bootlegged persistently over the decades, having it back in print with his blessing probably closes an important internal circle. But for us, it might be more a curio than an essential document.</span></span></p></div>"|20461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20461-michael-angelo/|6.7|Jayson Greene

<p>Ferreyra's release pairs two shorter '60s works with two longer, more recent compositions, and there's a fluidity to her work that suggests her methodology remains unchanged. The 21st century pieces are crisper and clock in at over twice the length as the earlier ones, but they sound of a whole. The accompanying notes, referencing alchemy and the Qabalah, suggest that change and the mercurial state of the natural world is a crucial theme to Ferreyra.</p>
<p>""Demeures aquatiques"", from 1967, manipulates the sounds of metal sheets and glass rods to explore what Ferreyra writes is ""the flow constantly facing the ebb."" In it, a nervous wobble of electromagnetic tape gets nearly submerged by a drone before high fluttering tones shoot up, those high frequencies themselves becoming a drone. ""Médisances"", from the next year, is a four-channel piece turning orchestral instruments and mouth harp into salt water taffy, twangs and bowed strings slowed to an exhilarating crawl, all leading up to an exclamatory yelp at the last moment. There's a similar sense of speed on ""Un fil invisible"", which warps its source sounds at a dizzying rate. At the same time, there's far more space and silence in the mix for the smaller sounds to move about, with strings zooming, tactile objects bursting into stardust, and small scurrying sounds suggesting mice aboard a space station.</p>
<p>Fans of the furthest fringes of electronic dance music might recognize Michel Redolfi’s name, as his music has appeared in mixes by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29260-rene-hell/"">Rene Hell</a> and early on in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>’s Fabriclive mix, leading into twisted UK garage. As the 3D graphics (like the original edition, this reissue includes a pair of 3D glasses in its gatefold sleeve) and title attests, Redolfi became enchanted with the Pacific Ocean during a seven-year period he spent in California ""attempting to musically translate my discovery of the Pacific,"" as he puts it.</p>
<p>Having spent one season learning to surf in the Pacific Ocean—which more often than not meant learning to read its temperamental, ever-changing waves and not be overwhelmed by its powerful currents—Redolfi’s compositions are a remarkable ‘translation’ of that body of water. Deploying the then-newfangled Synclavier digital synthesizer (which around 1977-78 was used primarily by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4742-frank-zappa/"">Frank Zappa</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a> producer Mike Thorne), ""Pacific Tubular Waves"" differs radically across its five movements. Redolfi conveys a wide emotional range on this side: giddiness, exhilaration, bewilderment, glee, panic, uncertainty, and both an eerie and sun-kissed state of calm.</p>
<p>While one side explores the surface of the Pacific, ""Immersion"" uses as its source sounds from hydrophones submerged into the ocean itself. The design of Redolfi’s compositions can feel macro and micro at once, where the sensation of the Pacific’s vastness as well as the way small droplets bead up on your skin are both tangible. One can visualize the tiny bubbles surrounding each sound event here and ""Deep Immersion"" in particular is mesmerizing.</p>
<p>There’s a peculiar contradiction at play when it comes to reassessing such obscure electronic compositions. On one hand, they are cloistered soundworlds, artifacts with no outside signifiers; on the other, they don’t sound dated. Despite the five decades separating some of Ferreyra’s works, one won’t find any correlation to the many changes that mainstream music underwent during that same time period.

His lyrics are punctuated by little directives, like ""Turn it down,"" ""stop,"" or ""turn around,"" ""here it goes,"" and the arrangement seems to be responding to him, amping up or quieting down depending on the line. Without a devastating hook<span>—</span>like the one on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15179-mikal-cronin-weight/"">""Weight""</a>, the opening track and lead single from Cronin’s 2013 full-length, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17959-mikal-cronin-mcii/"">MCII</a><span>—</span></i>it feels a bit like listening to stage instructions from a power pop song to be finished later, a rote rehearsal from a tired director.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The consecutive, uniform titles are apt: <i>MCIII</i> plays like a photocopy of <i>MCII</i>, with added incidental noise yielding substantially diminished returns. That said, <i>MCIII</i> was copied from good source material. Cronin sounded radiant on <i>MCII</i>, his supple singing inflected with subtle melodic idiosyncrasies and unfussy displays of considerable vocal range. Still, timing helped him. Cronin’s story<span>—</span>a dynamic songwriter hidden deep within San Francisco’s garage rock nouveau until <a href=""https://www.mergerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merge Records</a> asked for an album<span>—</span>was perhaps one of his best hooks. Devotees of Cronin’s collaborator, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a>, relished the idea of a pianist anomaly in a scene that seemed so singularly fixated on fuzz. It all conspired to artificially inflate <i>MCII</i>’s reception, which helps explain how <i>MCIII</i> sounds so much like it and so disappointing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>MCIII</i>’s press emphasizes that it’s a bigger record, stuffed with strings and horns and whatever else, but it's a red herring, a pretty transparent attempt to distract from the record’s fundamental shortcomings.<i> MCIII</i>’s string quartet contributes no more emotional heft than one violist did on <i>MCII</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=074wHh44p10"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Change""</a>, a song that also benefited from the feeling of velocity intimated by players pushing the beat. There’s less of that live ensemble feel to propel <i>MCIII</i>, none of the syncopated groove from a solid <i>MCII</i> track like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtZidTx3n6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""See It My Way""</a>. Instead, there’s a Greek instrument called a tzouras on ""ii) Gold"", which sounds pretty cool, but that’s a regrettable swap.</p>
<p>And even a symphony couldn’t redeem a pop-rock record without commanding lead vocals. Here, too, <i>MCIII</i> suffers a bit. Cronin’s dulcet hesitance has given way to slightly meeker delivery. The hooks are there<span>—</span>in the engaging vocal counterpoint to a descending horn line on the bridge of ""Say"", for instance<span>—</span>but they’re difficult to appreciate. The pat literalism of the lyrics—""I’m not alone,"" ""God, I need some control,"" ""I feel like I’m dying,"" and the like—doesn't help.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The conceit of <i>MCIII</i>’s second half involves a song suite about loss of personal agency, acceptance, self-discovery, and other such hallmarks of personal songwriting. This quasi-concept is basically indiscernible, indicated only by some hastily appended numerals at the beginning of each song title (One track, the rather beautiful but interlude-like ballad, ""v) Different"", <a href=""https://midheaven.com/item/san-francisco-is-doomed-by-va-mc#.VUpRbtNVikp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">appeared sans numerals on a compilation</a> last year.) Considering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28676-sonny-the-sunsets/"">Sonny and the Sunsets</a>’ recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20182-sonny-the-sunsets-talent-night-at-the-ashram/""><i>Talent Night at the Ashram </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31871-jack-name/"">Jack Name</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18900-jack-name-light-show/""><i>Light Show</i></a>, noncommittal concept records are fashionable among Californian garage outliers nowadays, but even a qualified application of the tag to <i>MCIII</i> is a stretch. Once the numerical song suite starts, the most important realization you are left with is that this record is front-loaded.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-2b2c724b-2a4f-7f90-3dc8-fdb69ed9324f""><span>That’s because ""i) Alone"" is an arduous intensity hike to nowhere, ""ii) Gold"" leans on the mid-tempo thud that was tiresome back on </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15844-mikal-cronin/""><i>Mikal Cronin</i></a><span>, and the outro of ""iv) Ready"" is just mercilessly redundant. Some seething guitar solos crop up, but nothing especially unhinged in light of his earlier collaborative work with Segall and <i>MCII</i>’s ace rave-up, ""Change"". Cronin’s lithe vocal melodies do sound beautiful on the spry closer, ""vi) Circle"", a reminder of the voice that commanded so many new listeners last time. Sequenced last, the song title is probably supposed to lend some poetic finality, but it speaks better to Cronin’s creative stasis.</span></span></p></div>"|20448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20448-mikal-cronin-mciii/|6.1|Sam Lefebvre

Her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17558-torres/"" target=""_blank"">2013 self-titled debut</a> felt inherently raw in its stripped-down folk-rock, a sound akin to that of her future collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a>. On <i>Sprinter, </i>however, Scott shrouds her voice with feedback and heavier rock instrumentation, created alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a> producer and percussionist Rob Ellis. The sound is like a gauze bandage covering the emotional wounds, the profound isolation and fear of abandonment, that sit at the heart of <i>Sprinter. </i>But Scott lets a little red bleed through nonetheless, and for listeners, at least, that's a good thing. </p>
<p>An album ago, Scott told what was presumed to be some version of her own adoption story with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS5EFP4PKuk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Moon &amp; Back""</a>; the song is written from the perspective of a woman who left a letter for the baby she gave up, but no names are given. Though Torres continues to write from perspectives besides her own—and it continues to prove interesting—on <i>Sprinter</i>, any trepidation she may have felt over first-person narrative is pushed aside in pursuit of unflinching honesty. On the album's stunning, solo acoustic closer ""The Exchange"", Scott is direct where before she was mysterious: ""Mother, father, I'm underwater, and I don't think you can pull me out of this,"" she coos in the chorus. ""Blew my per diem on an eighth of <a href=""https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dream"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blue Dream</a>/ So I can breathe but I still can't breathe,"" Scott adds, revealing her coping method of choice—sativa-dominant hybrids. The song's arresting plainspokenness recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case/"">Neko Case</a>'s memorable a cappella declaration of abandonment and rejection on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18451-neko-case-the-worse-things-get-the-harder-i-fight/""><i>The Worst Things Get, the Harder I Fight...</i></a>'s<i> </i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqSP-zccbys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Sprinter </i>splits its mood between depression and rage, mirrored in the album's loud-quiet musical dichotomy that is not unlike that of early PJ Harvey albums. With the aid of her co-producer Ellis (showing off his status as an underrated rock drummer who makes every beat sound crisp), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead"">Portishead</a> guitarist Adrian Utley (who recently helped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"">Perfume Genius</a> also reach a musical state as real as it is deeply unsettling), and Harvey bassist Ian Oliver, Scott fully inhabits her loudest moments by inching towards post-rock and synth-rock. The album's crowning achievement, ""Son, You Are No Island"", forges a mystical through line from Celtic music to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>'s<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vh6rmyzaBE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> ""I Think That I Would Die""</a>, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a>, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23356-mica-levi/"">Mica Levi</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19239-mica-levi-under-the-skin-ost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Under the Skin </i>soundtrack</a>. This song simmers with rage, a stick of dynamite waiting to blow, but it's Scott's restraint in delaying the explosions—first a wall of hardened distortion, then via vocal loops—that hits the hardest.</p>
<p>When she lets her depressive side out, Scott can ramble slightly. On ""Ferris Wheel"", Scott takes her time meandering through intense pining for another who's ""got the sadness too"" while an echoing guitar provides a woozy background twang. For such a slow pace, it goes on about twice as long as it needs to (seven minutes). On the flipside sits <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17450-torres-cowboy-guilt/"" target=""_blank"">""Cowboy Guilt""</a>, a rare light spot that lasts less than three minutes. Scott captures the thrill of instant interpersonal connection via the quick and steady beat of a drum machine and flourishes of a music box melody. </p>
<p>When Scott can find the right balance of these elements—dark, introspective, midtempo, highly distorted, and in the four to five-minute range—she hits a sweet spot, like on ""New Skin"" and the album's title track. These are the songs where Scott seems to lay out her thesis statements with a slight nods to theology; on ""New Skin"", atop a formidable '90s alt-rock build, Scott offers up a conclusion she's come to already: ""If you never know the darkness, then you're the one who fears the most."" Identity is the thorniest of growing pains, particularly when—like Scott—you come from adoptive lineage and a Southern Baptist upbringing you're now sussing out on your own. Wherever she might be on her own personal journey, Scott sounds on her records like someone getting closer every moment to her ultimate truth.</p></div>"|20290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20290-sprinter/|8.0|Jillian Mapes

A British neo-folk band, liberally applying the trappings of Americana, they made big songs well-suited to big stages, and they made them about as well as possible. But awful they were, nonetheless, a band so determined to be huge that they willed themselves into anonymity. Their latest effort, <i>Wilder Mind</i>, is a ""rock"" record in the least interesting sense of that word<span>—</span>a pastiche of the genre’s most common elements, from big percussion, electric guitars, and warm synths, to poignant but ultimately surface-level lyrics. It has all the elements of radio-friendly 2015 American rock'n'roll, with very timely nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Bruce Springsteen</a>, but what it’s lacking in is any kind of originality, or message<span>—</span>and most importantly, it’s lacking in banjo, the only thing that ever set the band apart from the bro-rock horde in the first place. With the production help of James Ford (member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5317-simian-mobile-disco"">Simian Mobile Disco</a>, and producer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys/"">Arctic Monkeys</a>) and Aaron Dessner of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>, the band has successfully created perhaps the most adequate commercial rock album of 2015. It’s fine. But fine is nowhere near good, and, when the music is this empty, it might actually be worse than bad.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Love songs are low-hanging fruit, and on </span><i>Wilder Mind</i><span>, Mumford picks from the lowest branches. The first words uttered on the album's opening track, ""Tompkins Square Park"", are ""Oh, babe,"" and like a boyfriend offering a generic apology, the song that follows sounds like it could be applied to any romantic situation at any time. There’s so little actual heart present in the songs, so little heartbreak, that it’s hard to imagine they were written from any kind of real place. This is music without any real center, designed only with montages and ""Grey’s Anatomy"" climaxes in mind. What the album sounds like, above all else, is easy money. These are songs that reflect emotion but generate none. They don't have feelings, they have </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/80-drake-feelings/""><span>#thefeels</span></a><span>. The ‘I’ in these songs feels heartbreak but not too much; longing, but not too much; joy, but again, not too much. </span>The influence of Dessner’s production is obvious in the richness of the arrangements, but where the National’s enormous sound is countered by obtuse and specific lyrics, Mumford matches a big, general sound with big, general statements of longing, and it falls flat. Petty and Springsteen are storytellers, bringing tangible and unique perspective to their personal narratives and those of their subjects. Mumford is telling the tale of the everyman, in that their narrative could be literally about every single man.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Songs like ""Believe"" are so lumbering that they are almost vulgar. ""I don’t even know if I believe/ Everything you’re trying to say to me,"" Mumford sings in his best Chris Martin-soft-voice, before laddering up to a loud, crunchy apex of sound that explodes into a plea for some kind of redemption. The conflict on </span><i>Wilder Mind</i><span> is pedestrian<span>—</span>the confusion of someone with nothing real to lose. On ""Cold Arms"", the only song on the record that provides a vague respite from the formula, pairing Mumford’s plaintive vocals with a single electric guitar, he sings of a relationship where he and his partner are simultaneously ""bloodshot and beat/ and never so alive."" There’s no evidence of life on the track itself, which follows every imaginable rule so closely that all traces of life are erased.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-65a2a2ed-2a41-d4ea-72a1-1d68db323989""><span>Many of the songs on the album reference specific locations in New York City, from the aforementioned opener to the galloping ""Ditmas"", which names the small Brooklyn neighborhood, home to many members of the National, where the album's demos were recorded. But they make no reference to any location outside of their titles, and listened to sequentially, it seems as if any of these songs could switch titles with the next one with no discernible effect. They are 12 variations on vaguely Don Henley-inspired arena schlock, and in this transition, they've found a new bottom. Mumford &amp; Sons' only hope to stand out was lost in favor of a cheap imitation, and not even a banjo can save them now.</span></span></p></div>"|20421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20421-wilder-mind/|2.0|Maud Deitch

True to his word, <i>II</i> is another snarling beast of a record, 10 more all-lunging, all-screaming anti-anthems crammed into another chaotic, cloistered half-hour, every inch as grotty and combustible and unfriendly as its predecessor. Once again produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2055-holy-fuck/"">Holy Fuck</a>'s Graham Walsh and engineered by Alex Bonefant, <i>II</i> is a refinement, not a reinvention: if you liked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17170-metz/""><i>Metz</i></a>, well, have another.<br/><br/>Metz spent five years honing their considerable strengths—Edkins' caustic fretwork and vocal agita, Hayden Menzies and Chris Slorach's stampeding low-end—before unleashing their self-titled debut. And, on <i>II</i>, they seem to feel no particular need to tinker around with what got them here. They still draw most of their inspiration from turn-of-the-'90s post-hardcore and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> albums on either side of <i>Nevermind</i>, and they still believe three-and-a-half minutes is about as long as any song has the right to be. The terse <i>II</i> comes in a smidge less rigid than its predecessor, a shade or two darker, a touch more physical. Not that you'll notice; once the bassline of opener ""Acetate"" takes hold, for 30 short minutes, your thoughts become a smear of white. These songs are not ""catchy"" by any traditional metric; they don't so much get stuck in your head as get lodged in your skin.</p>
<p>Metz take great pains to avoid your standard verse-chorus-verse structures, and <i>II</i>, even more than the debut, downplays the traditionally ""songier"" aspects of these songs for a series of weaponized strikes. Still, beyond a few drop-outs and punch-ins, these songs all seem to gnash about in a fairly similar fashion. <span>Hayden Menzies' bull-in-a-China-shop drums </span>are unrelenting, but they rarely push too far past their original tempo; Edkins talks his way through a few of these verses, but he's every bit as likely to start off in a full-on wail, and his riffs, while bludgeoning from the get-go, never seem quite sure how to up their own antes.</p>
<p>All of this makes the first 20 or so seconds of any Metz song roughly as thrilling as the last 20, which gives <i>II</i> the feeling of falling down the same set of stairs ten times in a row. There is not, as Edkins promised, anything for the radio on <i>II</i>, but neither is there much attempt to chart new territory, no ambitious gambits or radical tempo-shifts, nothing they haven't already proven themselves capable of in the past. These songs barely give themselves space to meander or develop; they pull the cord, and off they go. By and large, they perform their seethe-pummel-repeat routine with an almost mechanized precision. This one thing, they do incredibly well. Then they do it nine more times.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>II</i> is often more compelling on the rare occasions when Metz pulls back on the brontosaurus riffage and focuses on the connective tissue, the strands of sinew that surround many of these songs. The windchime-scrape at the tail end of ""Spit You Out"", the frizzy intro lick to ""I.O.U."", the whinnying strum at the top of ""Kicking a Can of Worms"": all these strange, static-y interludes, brief though they may be, build the kind of tension Metz are all too game to release. It's a shame they couldn't find a little more space for it. Fleeting though they are, these little interstitials provide a few much-needed valleys to <i>II</i>'s overabundance of peaks.<br/><br/>Throughout <i>II</i>, just about anything is prone to set Edkins off: crass commercialism, self-loathing, painkillers and—horror of horror—waiting in lines. These are angry-sounding songs, no question there. But when a typical chorus goes something like ""painkiller, painkiller/ that's why I feel unreal/ painkiller, painkiller/ that's one hell of a deal,"" you start to wonder if Edkins is really screaming out of some deep-seated passion, or if this is just the kind of music you scream over.</p>
<p>In interviews, Metz claim to be a punk band largely because it's the one genre the three of them could agree on. They're not claiming to be anything they're not, but—after two records far more similar than different—one can't help but wonder what else they <i>could</i> be. Were they willing to risk more, to stretch out further, to try a few more new things on for size, <i>II</i> might've sailed right past its beloved predecessor. But by sticking so closely to the script laid out by their debut, <i>II</i> is the one thing punk rock should never be: careful.</p></div>"|20439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20439-ii/|6.7|Paul Thompson

Pulsing with rattling beats, blurry neon synths, and Noel's skyward voice, it fit snugly into chillwave’s turn toward the dance floor. That move was spearheaded in part by the label <a href=""http://www.listentosilk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100% Silk</a>, a sub-imprint of <a href=""http://www.notnotfun.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun </a>(which released <i>Vibrant New Age</i>) led by L.A. Vampires' Amanda Brown (Noel’s bandmate in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27869-pocahaunted/"">Pocahaunted</a>). So the whole scene had a family vibe, and <i>Vibrant New Ag</i>e carried the bloodline well.</p>
<p>That movement has died down a bit, but on Noel's second album,<i> Chassis</i>, she holds firm to that style while trying to push it further. Her music is now grimier and denser, and it’s more inventive, more willing to color outside its own lines. The best moments throb with rhythm and soar with melody, conjuring an alternate past where new wave and disco burrow happily into the dirt while staring beatifically at the sun. Noel can mellow her grooves too, but with mixed results; her slower, less beat-driven material is uneven and prone to stasis. But overall <i>Chassis</i> generates more energy than it saps, and pumps more blood than it drains.</p>
<p>Noel finds electric power in pounding, nerve-tweaking tracks like escalating opener ""Life Is Long"" and the beautifully bouncing ""Bambini Art"". Here she seems laser-focused on inducing hypnosis by a thousand cuts, with every sound contributing to an overall hazy cloud of entrancement. ""I have not slept a lot,"" she sings at one point, and it sounds like it. Her busy mix is aided by talented collaborators—particularly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30175-m-geddes-gengras/"">M. Geddes Gengras,</a> who is credited on one song with ""stuttering"" and another with ""wizardry""—but this is clearly Noel’s show, as her personality seeps through every pore.</p>
<p>That personality is obsessed with danceable retro-pop, but Noel avoids anonymity by burning the edges of her sound and drenching it with atmosphere. In this way she shares a sensibility with Meghan Remy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29681-us-girls/"">U.S. Girls.</a> Both are unafraid to boldly echo the past through their homemade filters, confident that their own distinctive characters will make the music rise above mere homage.</p>
<p>Only when Noel calms things down does she risk losing that character. Slow-burning tracks like the tropical ballad ""90 Regina"" and the distant ""Sueño"" are admirable attempts to change pace, but they come off inert, like balloons in search of helium. Some of her restrained tunes do lock in well, though, and Noel wisely ends <i>Chassis</i> with her best one, the gripping ""Index of First Lines"". The key is a detonating drum machine, which provides such an intriguing spine to her torch-song purrs that it keeps the tune from ever sitting still. <i>Chassis</i> doesn’t always motor forward that well, but when it does, Noel’s creative restlessness is potent fuel.</p></div>"|20508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20508-chassis/|6.6|Marc Masters

This is the band’s third LP, following the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18623-best-coast-fade-away/""><i>Fade Away</i></a> mini-album that aborted the attempt at repositioning Bethany Cosentino as a stripped-down singer-songwriter, as on 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16609-the-only-place/""><i>The Only Place</i></a>. Instead, <i>California Nights </i>layers the fuzz back on top of her distinct voice for a radio-friendly take on '90s alt-rock—an attempt to stay part of the establishment as natural questions arise over the diminishing returns of the band’s core formula.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Much was initially made about Cosentino's penchant for pot, even as much of the music on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14472-crazy-for-you/""><i>Crazy for You</i></a> sounded relentlessly sunny in ways that being stoned often is not. Here, the tone is thicker. Producer Wally Gagel also helmed <i>Fade Away</i>, and <i>California Nights </i>is a natural extension; there are the familiar reference points of surf rock and garage rock, and the band occasionally heads in heavier directions. The title track and ""Feeling Ok"" find a midpoint between shoegaze and Sheryl Crow, the strangled reverb of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xdansEXFjg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sun Was High (So Was I)""</a> taken to its well-produced conclusion. When she sings ""I stay high all the time just to get by"" on the former, the music envelops her thoughts like a bad trip. Meanwhile, she’s added faint notes of sophistication: There’s what passes for a bridge on the aggressively catchy ""Heaven Sent"", which is only one line repeated a few times as the music drops in and out in classic pop-punk stop-time, but enough to change up the verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure so ardently followed on previous records.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>California Nights</i> is a professional album: heavy-ish, filled with hooks, somewhere between ""fast enough to dance"" and ""slow enough to sigh to while looking out of a window."" There’s nothing with the ubiquitous charm of <i>Crazy for You</i>—no <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqphb_WM1rM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Boyfriend""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvUtidZkqw4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Our Deal""</a>—but Cosentino's voice is bright, clear, and full of emotive sentimentality. As a lyricist, she remains a devout student of what Lester Bangs dubbed the Lou Reed ""I walked to the chair/ Then I sat in it"" school of lyrics; she expresses herself clearly. The nadir comes during ""So Unaware"", when she literally sings ""What is life?/ What is love?""—the core question of many works of art, true, but usually they're explored rather than just stated. A<span>s usual with Cosentino, you'll either be infuriated by the simplicity or endeared by its earnestness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Anyways, it's not like ""She loves you, yeah yeah yeah"" is featured on any AP English exams. It's easier to be annoyed when Cosentino lapses into rote sentiments, especially since her voice seems so sure of its rightness. ""Jealousy"" is addressed to those amorphous ""haters,"" the bane of any successful person's existence, and offers the deeply uncomplicated observation that ""girls will be girls and boys will be boys/ It's just the way it is."" A warning sign goes up when you consider Cosentino is no longer a broke-ish slacker sitting on the couch with her cat and her bong. She's achieved a level of success that allows her to appear in <a href=""http://www.bushmills.com/BMFriends.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">whiskey ads</a> and design her own Urban Outfitters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45608-best-coast-launches-urban-outfitters-clothing-line/"">clothing line</a>, while ignoring the obvious political implications. And why shouldn't she? Anyone with a problem is only a hater.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At times, it seems her insistence on affectless slackerism is less a genuine expression than a cynical pose, aimed at ensuring she stays part of the establishment. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> will tell you, <a href=""http://seanmalarkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Drake-HYFR-quote.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">there's a lot of money in being fashionably moody</a>. And yet for all the formal or ideological complaints, Cosentino remains remarkably capable of riffing on heartbreak, and the concomitant yearning. On ""When Will I Change"", she sings openly about what some would see as her self-absorption: ""It's not that bad, and I have no reason to be sad/ But I find a way almost every day to stay this way."" Well, it’s honest. If this is what Best Coast continues to give us after six years and three albums, you can either shrug it off or let the vibes carry you away.</p></div>"|20554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20554-california-nights/|6.4|Jeremy Gordon

This was all before the Internet, so you basically had what a jewel box told you. It's hard to imagine at this point, but when I first heard them, I didn't know <i>anything</i> about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"">Mark Kozelek</a>, the frontman and mastermind behind the project. I'm not sure I knew his name, and I definitely didn't know what he looked like, or his personality outside of the songs. I also had no idea the band was a quartet, or that they lived in San Francisco (in Kozelek's case, via Ohio). At least for me, Red House Painters existed outside of a scene, too. They had a familiar record label with its own distinct aesthetic, but that was the only real touchstone.</p>
<p>Not that any of this is bad. The songs on the first four albums—1992's <i>Down Colorful Hill</i>, 1993's pair of self-titled albums (the first nicknamed Rollercoaster, the second Bridge, after the photographs on their covers), and 1995's <i>Ocean Beach</i> (here packaged with the <i>Shock Me</i> EP from a year earlier)—felt personal and private enough that it was easy to get lost in your own head while listening. They featured heartbreaking, personal lyrics and were accompanied by stark, often naturalistic photographs on the covers. The package came with the crystalline, spacious production and Kozelek's clear, powerful voice, and these things merged in an almost mystical way. The material felt less composed or worked over; it was more like the songs were birthed fully formed. They could drift on for more than 10 minutes, but you kind of gave up on keeping track of this kind of thing.</p>
<p>When old albums get reissued, which they increasingly do, the practice usually offers a chance to hear familiar songs again, sometimes with remastering, maybe a few bonuses. Some listeners are feeling nostalgic, seeking to recreate the original context in their minds, while many others are learning about the material for the first time, and aren't all that clear on the context beyond the updated liner notes. <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a>'s decision to reissue Red House Painters' first four albums as a fairly spare limited-edition Record Store Day box set (on bronze vinyl, with individual album reissues on black vinyl to follow) offers a unique angle: The band's cantankerous frontman (as we can now call him after that whole War on Drugs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56989-here-it-is-mark-kozeleks-song-called-war-on-drugs-suck-my-cock/"">debacle</a>) is much better known, and known quite differently, all these years later. Now you do know exactly who Mark Kozelek is, or at least you think you do.</p>
<p>It's important to remember, though, that the group wasn't just Kozelek. At least not at the beginning. For the first three full-lengths, it was Kozelek on vocals and guitars along with drummer Anthony Koutsos, bassist Jerry Vessel, and guitarist Gorden Mack. (Koutsos and Vessel continued with Kozelek to 2001; Mack left in 1995 and was replaced by Phil Carney, who still plays with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"">Sun Kil Moon</a> now and then.) Starting with <i>Songs for a Blue Guitar</i>, which followed Red House Painters' last album for 4AD <i>Ocean Beach</i>, Kozelek basically started doing everything on his own. He released it on Supreme Recordings, a label owned by John Hughes and under the auspices of Island Records, which reminds me that he's the only person from Red House Painters who also went on to act in movies.</p>
<p>Even accounting for the added years and maybe some Kozelek burnout, the four LPs in this boxset remain Red House Painters' most magical records, and some of the most beautiful works of Kozelek's career. If you're someone who's been put off by his feuds and outbursts, put aside those reservations—these records deserve it. And, really, when you come back to them, even after all these years, that mystery somehow still remains. In fact, now and then I need to remind myself just who it is I'm listening to. Unlike later SKM, the vocals are treated with airier effects. The production is deep and spacious, and sounds very 4AD. Kozelek's lyrics are personal, and moving, but come cloaked in ellipses and metaphor rather than the tell-all logorrhea of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji/""><i>Benji</i></a>.</p>
<p>The first song we heard from Red House Painters is ""24"", the magisterial slowcore opener on 1992's <b><i>Down Colorful Hill</i></b>. It's from the point of view of someone, aged 24, worrying about growing old: ""Oldness comes to rile/ The youth who dream suicide."" This is a concern across all of Kozelek's work, and it's easy to imagine him worrying about these same things when he was 9 going on 10.</p>
<p>The start of ""24"" is nearly silent—gentle minimal guitar before drums come in; it almost sounds like the start of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"">Codeine</a> track. These songs were demos, and are lightly touched up for the proper 4AD debut, but still sound spare and homemade and thin in the best way (a way that works with the confessional tone of the material). Red House Painters are more of a definable rock band on <i>Colorful</i>, though, with fuzzed guitars, martial drumming, and more basic structures; on the slinky post-rock of ""Japanese to English"", you can imagine them in a practice space, jamming it out. In this sense, it's less otherworldly than the next two albums.</p>
<p>On the anguished second track, ""Medicine Bottle"", he offers up some of the detail-rich run-on lyricism that he returns to later with SKM. There's a playful country western-tinged sendup ""Lord Kill the Pain"", which takes Kozelek's depressing lyrics to a comical extreme with lines like: ""Kill my neighbors/ And all my family too/ They doubt my direction."" Of course, he's likely partially serious, too. This humor is something Kozelek has maintained, even when his critics think of him as being peevish or over-sensitive.</p>
<p>There's the nostalgic, quietly heartbreaking ""Michael"", a song about someone wondering whatever happened to their best friend from years earlier with both funny (""Do you remember our first subway ride?/ Our first heavy metal haircuts?"") and moving (""I remember your smile in the sun/ The day-dreaming boy without your shirt on…"") details. It ends with Kozelek noting that the connection is still there: ""You're the oldest juvenile delinquent bum/ My best friend.""</p>
<p>It's the gorgeous title track that hints most at the truly brilliant second collection, <b>Rollercoaster</b>. It's nimble. It feels effortless. It expands to 11 minutes without seeming to push very hard. It barely matters what he's saying because of how it's paced and how it's said. On Rollercoaster<i>, </i>it felt like RHP existed outside of everything, and listening now, it still feels that way. <i>Down Colorful Hill</i> is an excellent, idiosyncratic debut, but it doesn't quite prepare you for the 1993 collection. Mark Kozelek produced Rollercoaster, and it's proof enough that he's the best person to be handling the knobs on his own songs: the guitar sound is perfect, songs burst and bloom, the vocals are placed perfectly like ghosts. Overall, Rollercoaster and Bridge, released the same year and featuring songs from the same session, move away from the more songwriterly approach of the other work in Kozelek's career—the production is more distant and expansive, and the instruments are given to lengthy excursions and big blasts of guitars.</p>
<p>There are technically 14 songs on Rollercoaster, but it's not the kind of album where you stop to note these kinds of distinctions: Each song feels like a detail in a large painting. On it, Kozelek fears the violence in his blood, remembers being an outcast, worries about getting older and losing meaning and connections (""Scares me how you get older/ How you forget about each other""), dismisses a girl in New Jersey, acts like a romantic asshole (""<span class=""st"">I still feel the sting in my hand/ From when I hit you/ I keep your picture tidy and safe in a shrine""</span>), confesses that he's afraid to drive, and manages to do all this in moving, atmospheric anthems that resonate two decades later. The songs tend to go on forever, and it seems like Kozelek assumes if he stops, his subject might disappear.</p>
<p>He returns again and again to the idea of forgetting, and he doesn't leave out the details that could make him look bad: ""I've had enough of the/ Brutal beatings and name callings/ To lose me to this bed/ Bruised internally, eternally."" You get warts and all, even in songs that feel like they could be sonnets. He wonders a lot where people are. The 13-minute ""Mother"" is filled with the sort of raging fear of loss that we hear later on ""I Can't Live Without My Mother's Love"". The album also features ""Katy Song"", a classic Kozelek eight-and-a-half-minute paean to not being enough. If you ever need to cry on command, I recommend taking a listen. Rollercoaster closes with the brief, compact ""Brown Eyes"", a two-minute acoustic jangle of a song that suggests where he goes on <i>Ocean Beach</i> and onward (and, itself, ends with a lovely 40 seconds of quietly expansive drums and dainty guitars).</p>
<p>Rollercoaster was followed by <b>Bridge</b> in October of 1993; it featured songs from the same recording session as Rollercoaster, and on paper looks like an odds and sods—its eight songs include a cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""I Am a Rock"", a feedbacking rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", and a more electrified, revved-up take on Rollercoaster's ""New Jersey"". But Kozelek is a master of covers, and makes the songs his own; plus, there are more than enough originals here to balance it out.</p>
<p>The standouts here are the songs that sound most like they'd fit on Rollercoaster, the pastoral ""Bubble"" and the dark, strummed ""Uncle Joe"", which starts with the line ""where have all the people gone in my life?"" and finds him in pain after late-night television is over. (I've seen kids on lyric ""meaning"" sites likening ""Bubble"" to Internet dating because of lines like ""I embrace the moment, I'm in love with a dream/ And toy with ideas that burn deep inside me/ Cause a picture is all you are to me/ A picture is all you'll ever be."")</p>
<p>Throughout, the tone is eerier and somehow more quietly violent than Rollercoaster. This comes to a head on the eight-minute ""Blindfold"" that moves through lyrics like ""What possessed you not to include me?/ How have you failed to invite me/ How could you laugh with her in that theater?/ When you're off and I'm alone?"" and ends with Kozelek howling his best grunge (nay, metal) howl, raging louder than the drums or clashing guitars around him.</p>
<p>The final album on the box, and his last for 4AD, is 1995's <b><i>Ocean Beach</i></b>. It opens with a sunny, lilting instrumental called ""Cabezon"", three breezy minutes of pleasant music. The album, in general, seems to be Kozelek's California record, and stands out from what came before it.</p>
<p>The first proper song, ""Summer Dress"", is in the more usual downcast Red House Painters' mode, but the songs are folkier and less amorphous; overall, this is the one RHP offering you could compare to Toad the Wet Sprocket and be basically right. The hooks are immediate, the sequencing rock-album complete: The wistful ""Summer Dress"" transitions to the gently fuzzed rock of ""San Geronimo"" which moves into the piano-led ballad, ""Shadows"". You get almost hippie-like noodles on the steel-guitars of ""Over My Head"" (before which we get studio chatter that jokingly mentions ""new age windchimes"") and an echo of past melancholia with ""Red Carpet"". It's a stately, well-composed collection, and it's beautiful. The use of feedback is delicate (even on the more searing close of ""Moments"", which is reminiscent of the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a> use feedback). </p>
<p>It closes with the 13-minute ""Drop"", one of Kozelek's best heartsick pieces: ""I'd like to come home to see you/ And to catch your sickness by the bedside/ But then you'd know how much I really need you."" With him it's never easy, of course, and he adds: ""But then my hate for you/ Makes my feelings altogether drop."" It's a masterful closer, and an example of how Kozelek can draw you into his world and make you forget time's passage, even as he obsesses over it.</p>
<p>For this box, its sister is the four-song <i>Shock Me </i>EP. ""Shock Me"" is <a href=""%E2%80%A8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iauaDVVPGW8"" target=""_blank"">a Kiss cover</a>, though you wouldn't know it unless you'd memorized the 1977 original. You get it here in both its four-minute ""electric"" and 11-minute acoustic version, along with two very good, shorter songs, ""Sundays and Holidays"" and ""Three-Legged Cat"". It's great to have it in the box, though sonically, it would've made more sense to pair it with either Rollercoaser or Bridge. </p>
<p>Listening closely to these records now shines a light on the rest of Kozelek's career. It's the most you can hope for as far as reissues go, and it really does feel like a skeleton key returning to these albums you thought you knew so well. You think of these songs, with their fear of growing old and dying, and put them in context with all the songs from his youth he and his band have covered (by artists like AC/DC, Kiss, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, John Denver, Paul McCartney), and where he's ended up now, singing about being old, and you realize that time itself was always the preoccupation here, as well as the inevitability of death, even in your happiest moments. And you realize, listening, that you got older, too.</p></div>"|20517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20517-box-set/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

This was all before the Internet, so you basically had what a jewel box told you. It's hard to imagine at this point, but when I first heard them, I didn't know <i>anything</i> about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"">Mark Kozelek</a>, the frontman and mastermind behind the project. I'm not sure I knew his name, and I definitely didn't know what he looked like, or his personality outside of the songs. I also had no idea the band was a quartet, or that they lived in San Francisco (in Kozelek's case, via Ohio). At least for me, Red House Painters existed outside of a scene, too. They had a familiar record label with its own distinct aesthetic, but that was the only real touchstone.</p>
<p>Not that any of this is bad. The songs on the first four albums—1992's <i>Down Colorful Hill</i>, 1993's pair of self-titled albums (the first nicknamed Rollercoaster, the second Bridge, after the photographs on their covers), and 1995's <i>Ocean Beach</i> (here packaged with the <i>Shock Me</i> EP from a year earlier)—felt personal and private enough that it was easy to get lost in your own head while listening. They featured heartbreaking, personal lyrics and were accompanied by stark, often naturalistic photographs on the covers. The package came with the crystalline, spacious production and Kozelek's clear, powerful voice, and these things merged in an almost mystical way. The material felt less composed or worked over; it was more like the songs were birthed fully formed. They could drift on for more than 10 minutes, but you kind of gave up on keeping track of this kind of thing.</p>
<p>When old albums get reissued, which they increasingly do, the practice usually offers a chance to hear familiar songs again, sometimes with remastering, maybe a few bonuses. Some listeners are feeling nostalgic, seeking to recreate the original context in their minds, while many others are learning about the material for the first time, and aren't all that clear on the context beyond the updated liner notes. <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a>'s decision to reissue Red House Painters' first four albums as a fairly spare limited-edition Record Store Day box set (on bronze vinyl, with individual album reissues on black vinyl to follow) offers a unique angle: The band's cantankerous frontman (as we can now call him after that whole War on Drugs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56989-here-it-is-mark-kozeleks-song-called-war-on-drugs-suck-my-cock/"">debacle</a>) is much better known, and known quite differently, all these years later. Now you do know exactly who Mark Kozelek is, or at least you think you do.</p>
<p>It's important to remember, though, that the group wasn't just Kozelek. At least not at the beginning. For the first three full-lengths, it was Kozelek on vocals and guitars along with drummer Anthony Koutsos, bassist Jerry Vessel, and guitarist Gorden Mack. (Koutsos and Vessel continued with Kozelek to 2001; Mack left in 1995 and was replaced by Phil Carney, who still plays with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"">Sun Kil Moon</a> now and then.) Starting with <i>Songs for a Blue Guitar</i>, which followed Red House Painters' last album for 4AD <i>Ocean Beach</i>, Kozelek basically started doing everything on his own. He released it on Supreme Recordings, a label owned by John Hughes and under the auspices of Island Records, which reminds me that he's the only person from Red House Painters who also went on to act in movies.</p>
<p>Even accounting for the added years and maybe some Kozelek burnout, the four LPs in this boxset remain Red House Painters' most magical records, and some of the most beautiful works of Kozelek's career. If you're someone who's been put off by his feuds and outbursts, put aside those reservations—these records deserve it. And, really, when you come back to them, even after all these years, that mystery somehow still remains. In fact, now and then I need to remind myself just who it is I'm listening to. Unlike later SKM, the vocals are treated with airier effects. The production is deep and spacious, and sounds very 4AD. Kozelek's lyrics are personal, and moving, but come cloaked in ellipses and metaphor rather than the tell-all logorrhea of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji/""><i>Benji</i></a>.</p>
<p>The first song we heard from Red House Painters is ""24"", the magisterial slowcore opener on 1992's <b><i>Down Colorful Hill</i></b>. It's from the point of view of someone, aged 24, worrying about growing old: ""Oldness comes to rile/ The youth who dream suicide."" This is a concern across all of Kozelek's work, and it's easy to imagine him worrying about these same things when he was 9 going on 10.</p>
<p>The start of ""24"" is nearly silent—gentle minimal guitar before drums come in; it almost sounds like the start of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"">Codeine</a> track. These songs were demos, and are lightly touched up for the proper 4AD debut, but still sound spare and homemade and thin in the best way (a way that works with the confessional tone of the material). Red House Painters are more of a definable rock band on <i>Colorful</i>, though, with fuzzed guitars, martial drumming, and more basic structures; on the slinky post-rock of ""Japanese to English"", you can imagine them in a practice space, jamming it out. In this sense, it's less otherworldly than the next two albums.</p>
<p>On the anguished second track, ""Medicine Bottle"", he offers up some of the detail-rich run-on lyricism that he returns to later with SKM. There's a playful country western-tinged sendup ""Lord Kill the Pain"", which takes Kozelek's depressing lyrics to a comical extreme with lines like: ""Kill my neighbors/ And all my family too/ They doubt my direction."" Of course, he's likely partially serious, too. This humor is something Kozelek has maintained, even when his critics think of him as being peevish or over-sensitive.</p>
<p>There's the nostalgic, quietly heartbreaking ""Michael"", a song about someone wondering whatever happened to their best friend from years earlier with both funny (""Do you remember our first subway ride?/ Our first heavy metal haircuts?"") and moving (""I remember your smile in the sun/ The day-dreaming boy without your shirt on…"") details. It ends with Kozelek noting that the connection is still there: ""You're the oldest juvenile delinquent bum/ My best friend.""</p>
<p>It's the gorgeous title track that hints most at the truly brilliant second collection, <b>Rollercoaster</b>. It's nimble. It feels effortless. It expands to 11 minutes without seeming to push very hard. It barely matters what he's saying because of how it's paced and how it's said. On Rollercoaster<i>, </i>it felt like RHP existed outside of everything, and listening now, it still feels that way. <i>Down Colorful Hill</i> is an excellent, idiosyncratic debut, but it doesn't quite prepare you for the 1993 collection. Mark Kozelek produced Rollercoaster, and it's proof enough that he's the best person to be handling the knobs on his own songs: the guitar sound is perfect, songs burst and bloom, the vocals are placed perfectly like ghosts. Overall, Rollercoaster and Bridge, released the same year and featuring songs from the same session, move away from the more songwriterly approach of the other work in Kozelek's career—the production is more distant and expansive, and the instruments are given to lengthy excursions and big blasts of guitars.</p>
<p>There are technically 14 songs on Rollercoaster, but it's not the kind of album where you stop to note these kinds of distinctions: Each song feels like a detail in a large painting. On it, Kozelek fears the violence in his blood, remembers being an outcast, worries about getting older and losing meaning and connections (""Scares me how you get older/ How you forget about each other""), dismisses a girl in New Jersey, acts like a romantic asshole (""<span class=""st"">I still feel the sting in my hand/ From when I hit you/ I keep your picture tidy and safe in a shrine""</span>), confesses that he's afraid to drive, and manages to do all this in moving, atmospheric anthems that resonate two decades later. The songs tend to go on forever, and it seems like Kozelek assumes if he stops, his subject might disappear.</p>
<p>He returns again and again to the idea of forgetting, and he doesn't leave out the details that could make him look bad: ""I've had enough of the/ Brutal beatings and name callings/ To lose me to this bed/ Bruised internally, eternally."" You get warts and all, even in songs that feel like they could be sonnets. He wonders a lot where people are. The 13-minute ""Mother"" is filled with the sort of raging fear of loss that we hear later on ""I Can't Live Without My Mother's Love"".

(I've seen kids on lyric ""meaning"" sites likening ""Bubble"" to Internet dating because of lines like ""I embrace the moment, I'm in love with a dream/ And toy with ideas that burn deep inside me/ Cause a picture is all you are to me/ A picture is all you'll ever be."")</p>
<p>Throughout, the tone is eerier and somehow more quietly violent than Rollercoaster. This comes to a head on the eight-minute ""Blindfold"" that moves through lyrics like ""What possessed you not to include me?/ How have you failed to invite me/ How could you laugh with her in that theater?/ When you're off and I'm alone?"" and ends with Kozelek howling his best grunge (nay, metal) howl, raging louder than the drums or clashing guitars around him.</p>
<p>The final album on the box, and his last for 4AD, is 1995's <b><i>Ocean Beach</i></b>. It opens with a sunny, lilting instrumental called ""Cabezon"", three breezy minutes of pleasant music. The album, in general, seems to be Kozelek's California record, and stands out from what came before it.</p>
<p>The first proper song, ""Summer Dress"", is in the more usual downcast Red House Painters' mode, but the songs are folkier and less amorphous; overall, this is the one RHP offering you could compare to Toad the Wet Sprocket and be basically right. The hooks are immediate, the sequencing rock-album complete: The wistful ""Summer Dress"" transitions to the gently fuzzed rock of ""San Geronimo"" which moves into the piano-led ballad, ""Shadows"". You get almost hippie-like noodles on the steel-guitars of ""Over My Head"" (before which we get studio chatter that jokingly mentions ""new age windchimes"") and an echo of past melancholia with ""Red Carpet"". It's a stately, well-composed collection, and it's beautiful. The use of feedback is delicate (even on the more searing close of ""Moments"", which is reminiscent of the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a> use feedback). </p>
<p>It closes with the 13-minute ""Drop"", one of Kozelek's best heartsick pieces: ""I'd like to come home to see you/ And to catch your sickness by the bedside/ But then you'd know how much I really need you."" With him it's never easy, of course, and he adds: ""But then my hate for you/ Makes my feelings altogether drop."" It's a masterful closer, and an example of how Kozelek can draw you into his world and make you forget time's passage, even as he obsesses over it.</p>
<p>For this box, its sister is the four-song <i>Shock Me </i>EP. ""Shock Me"" is <a href=""%E2%80%A8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iauaDVVPGW8"" target=""_blank"">a Kiss cover</a>, though you wouldn't know it unless you'd memorized the 1977 original. You get it here in both its four-minute ""electric"" and 11-minute acoustic version, along with two very good, shorter songs, ""Sundays and Holidays"" and ""Three-Legged Cat"". It's great to have it in the box, though sonically, it would've made more sense to pair it with either Rollercoaser or Bridge. </p>
<p>Listening closely to these records now shines a light on the rest of Kozelek's career. It's the most you can hope for as far as reissues go, and it really does feel like a skeleton key returning to these albums you thought you knew so well. You think of these songs, with their fear of growing old and dying, and put them in context with all the songs from his youth he and his band have covered (by artists like AC/DC, Kiss, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, John Denver, Paul McCartney), and where he's ended up now, singing about being old, and you realize that time itself was always the preoccupation here, as well as the inevitability of death, even in your happiest moments. And you realize, listening, that you got older, too.</p></div>"|20517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20517-box-set/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

This was all before the Internet, so you basically had what a jewel box told you. It's hard to imagine at this point, but when I first heard them, I didn't know <i>anything</i> about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"">Mark Kozelek</a>, the frontman and mastermind behind the project. I'm not sure I knew his name, and I definitely didn't know what he looked like, or his personality outside of the songs. I also had no idea the band was a quartet, or that they lived in San Francisco (in Kozelek's case, via Ohio). At least for me, Red House Painters existed outside of a scene, too. They had a familiar record label with its own distinct aesthetic, but that was the only real touchstone.</p>
<p>Not that any of this is bad. The songs on the first four albums—1992's <i>Down Colorful Hill</i>, 1993's pair of self-titled albums (the first nicknamed Rollercoaster, the second Bridge, after the photographs on their covers), and 1995's <i>Ocean Beach</i> (here packaged with the <i>Shock Me</i> EP from a year earlier)—felt personal and private enough that it was easy to get lost in your own head while listening. They featured heartbreaking, personal lyrics and were accompanied by stark, often naturalistic photographs on the covers. The package came with the crystalline, spacious production and Kozelek's clear, powerful voice, and these things merged in an almost mystical way. The material felt less composed or worked over; it was more like the songs were birthed fully formed. They could drift on for more than 10 minutes, but you kind of gave up on keeping track of this kind of thing.</p>
<p>When old albums get reissued, which they increasingly do, the practice usually offers a chance to hear familiar songs again, sometimes with remastering, maybe a few bonuses. Some listeners are feeling nostalgic, seeking to recreate the original context in their minds, while many others are learning about the material for the first time, and aren't all that clear on the context beyond the updated liner notes. <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a>'s decision to reissue Red House Painters' first four albums as a fairly spare limited-edition Record Store Day box set (on bronze vinyl, with individual album reissues on black vinyl to follow) offers a unique angle: The band's cantankerous frontman (as we can now call him after that whole War on Drugs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56989-here-it-is-mark-kozeleks-song-called-war-on-drugs-suck-my-cock/"">debacle</a>) is much better known, and known quite differently, all these years later. Now you do know exactly who Mark Kozelek is, or at least you think you do.</p>
<p>It's important to remember, though, that the group wasn't just Kozelek. At least not at the beginning. For the first three full-lengths, it was Kozelek on vocals and guitars along with drummer Anthony Koutsos, bassist Jerry Vessel, and guitarist Gorden Mack. (Koutsos and Vessel continued with Kozelek to 2001; Mack left in 1995 and was replaced by Phil Carney, who still plays with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"">Sun Kil Moon</a> now and then.) Starting with <i>Songs for a Blue Guitar</i>, which followed Red House Painters' last album for 4AD <i>Ocean Beach</i>, Kozelek basically started doing everything on his own. He released it on Supreme Recordings, a label owned by John Hughes and under the auspices of Island Records, which reminds me that he's the only person from Red House Painters who also went on to act in movies.</p>
<p>Even accounting for the added years and maybe some Kozelek burnout, the four LPs in this boxset remain Red House Painters' most magical records, and some of the most beautiful works of Kozelek's career. If you're someone who's been put off by his feuds and outbursts, put aside those reservations—these records deserve it. And, really, when you come back to them, even after all these years, that mystery somehow still remains. In fact, now and then I need to remind myself just who it is I'm listening to. Unlike later SKM, the vocals are treated with airier effects. The production is deep and spacious, and sounds very 4AD. Kozelek's lyrics are personal, and moving, but come cloaked in ellipses and metaphor rather than the tell-all logorrhea of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji/""><i>Benji</i></a>.</p>
<p>The first song we heard from Red House Painters is ""24"", the magisterial slowcore opener on 1992's <b><i>Down Colorful Hill</i></b>. It's from the point of view of someone, aged 24, worrying about growing old: ""Oldness comes to rile/ The youth who dream suicide."" This is a concern across all of Kozelek's work, and it's easy to imagine him worrying about these same things when he was 9 going on 10.</p>
<p>The start of ""24"" is nearly silent—gentle minimal guitar before drums come in; it almost sounds like the start of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"">Codeine</a> track. These songs were demos, and are lightly touched up for the proper 4AD debut, but still sound spare and homemade and thin in the best way (a way that works with the confessional tone of the material). Red House Painters are more of a definable rock band on <i>Colorful</i>, though, with fuzzed guitars, martial drumming, and more basic structures; on the slinky post-rock of ""Japanese to English"", you can imagine them in a practice space, jamming it out. In this sense, it's less otherworldly than the next two albums.</p>
<p>On the anguished second track, ""Medicine Bottle"", he offers up some of the detail-rich run-on lyricism that he returns to later with SKM. There's a playful country western-tinged sendup ""Lord Kill the Pain"", which takes Kozelek's depressing lyrics to a comical extreme with lines like: ""Kill my neighbors/ And all my family too/ They doubt my direction."" Of course, he's likely partially serious, too. This humor is something Kozelek has maintained, even when his critics think of him as being peevish or over-sensitive.</p>
<p>There's the nostalgic, quietly heartbreaking ""Michael"", a song about someone wondering whatever happened to their best friend from years earlier with both funny (""Do you remember our first subway ride?/ Our first heavy metal haircuts?"") and moving (""I remember your smile in the sun/ The day-dreaming boy without your shirt on…"") details. It ends with Kozelek noting that the connection is still there: ""You're the oldest juvenile delinquent bum/ My best friend.""</p>
<p>It's the gorgeous title track that hints most at the truly brilliant second collection, <b>Rollercoaster</b>. It's nimble. It feels effortless. It expands to 11 minutes without seeming to push very hard. It barely matters what he's saying because of how it's paced and how it's said. On Rollercoaster<i>, </i>it felt like RHP existed outside of everything, and listening now, it still feels that way. <i>Down Colorful Hill</i> is an excellent, idiosyncratic debut, but it doesn't quite prepare you for the 1993 collection. Mark Kozelek produced Rollercoaster, and it's proof enough that he's the best person to be handling the knobs on his own songs: the guitar sound is perfect, songs burst and bloom, the vocals are placed perfectly like ghosts. Overall, Rollercoaster and Bridge, released the same year and featuring songs from the same session, move away from the more songwriterly approach of the other work in Kozelek's career—the production is more distant and expansive, and the instruments are given to lengthy excursions and big blasts of guitars.</p>
<p>There are technically 14 songs on Rollercoaster, but it's not the kind of album where you stop to note these kinds of distinctions: Each song feels like a detail in a large painting. On it, Kozelek fears the violence in his blood, remembers being an outcast, worries about getting older and losing meaning and connections (""Scares me how you get older/ How you forget about each other""), dismisses a girl in New Jersey, acts like a romantic asshole (""<span class=""st"">I still feel the sting in my hand/ From when I hit you/ I keep your picture tidy and safe in a shrine""</span>), confesses that he's afraid to drive, and manages to do all this in moving, atmospheric anthems that resonate two decades later. The songs tend to go on forever, and it seems like Kozelek assumes if he stops, his subject might disappear.</p>
<p>He returns again and again to the idea of forgetting, and he doesn't leave out the details that could make him look bad: ""I've had enough of the/ Brutal beatings and name callings/ To lose me to this bed/ Bruised internally, eternally."" You get warts and all, even in songs that feel like they could be sonnets. He wonders a lot where people are. The 13-minute ""Mother"" is filled with the sort of raging fear of loss that we hear later on ""I Can't Live Without My Mother's Love"". The album also features ""Katy Song"", a classic Kozelek eight-and-a-half-minute paean to not being enough. If you ever need to cry on command, I recommend taking a listen. Rollercoaster closes with the brief, compact ""Brown Eyes"", a two-minute acoustic jangle of a song that suggests where he goes on <i>Ocean Beach</i> and onward (and, itself, ends with a lovely 40 seconds of quietly expansive drums and dainty guitars).</p>
<p>Rollercoaster was followed by <b>Bridge</b> in October of 1993; it featured songs from the same recording session as Rollercoaster, and on paper looks like an odds and sods—its eight songs include a cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""I Am a Rock"", a feedbacking rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", and a more electrified, revved-up take on Rollercoaster's ""New Jersey"". But Kozelek is a master of covers, and makes the songs his own; plus, there are more than enough originals here to balance it out.</p>
<p>The standouts here are the songs that sound most like they'd fit on Rollercoaster, the pastoral ""Bubble"" and the dark, strummed ""Uncle Joe"", which starts with the line ""where have all the people gone in my life?"" and finds him in pain after late-night television is over. (I've seen kids on lyric ""meaning"" sites likening ""Bubble"" to Internet dating because of lines like ""I embrace the moment, I'm in love with a dream/ And toy with ideas that burn deep inside me/ Cause a picture is all you are to me/ A picture is all you'll ever be."")</p>
<p>Throughout, the tone is eerier and somehow more quietly violent than Rollercoaster. This comes to a head on the eight-minute ""Blindfold"" that moves through lyrics like ""What possessed you not to include me?/ How have you failed to invite me/ How could you laugh with her in that theater?/ When you're off and I'm alone?"" and ends with Kozelek howling his best grunge (nay, metal) howl, raging louder than the drums or clashing guitars around him.</p>

The song is a sensual shuffle that channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31140-sza/"">SZA</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"">Jhené Aiko</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"">Kelela</a>, from spacey, hesitant vocals, to a slowed-and-pitched-down rap (from the typically nimble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a>), to the lyrics—it’s a straightforward ode to lust, all about desire and longing and waiting for the moment where wanting and having your partner collide. It’s a fascinating song, and only in the most superficial ways does it suggest anything about <i>You Should Be Here</i>’s loftier goals.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The song’s lyrics might be the biggest red herring of all. Kehlani spends most of <i>You Should Be Here</i> switching between telling various dudes to get their shit together and the rest on a mission to inspire humanity. Kehlani has little in common with other former-child-stars-turned-singers <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zendaya</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/"">Tinashe</a> (Kehlani and her band made it to the finals on ""America’s Got Talent""), and she has little in common with the music of cool, casually misogynistic R&amp;B bros, and in spite of a connection to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31498-partynextdoor/"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a> and hailing from Oakland, neither of those facts figure much into her music, at least on an obvious level. If there’s a contemporary comparison to be made, it’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>. Kehlani, along with right-hand-man producer Jahaan Sweet, shares Ocean’s auteuristic vision and plainspoken eloquence. And, much like Ocean, when Kehlani veers toward the maudlin, somehow the sincerity of it all redeems itself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The beating heart at the center of<i> You Should Be Here</i> forgives some of these dips into mawkishness. <i>You Should Be Here</i>’s dynamism and generosity is something to be amazed by, especially considering Kehlani is all of 19 years old. On the stunning ""Wanted"", she sings, ""As a woman/ When you are broken/ You make a choice to stay down or go in,"" but the chorus, one of resounding triumph, begins with the declaration, ""He makes me feel wanted/ Like no one has before."" Kehlani weaves an emotional, stirring thread through her songs that mostly feels joyful, even when she’s lurking on Instagram (""Jealous"") or being vexed by a new flame (""Yet"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-81b0e225-25d3-288e-42ec-62de6041cd32"">When some of these songs soar in their choruses, like on ""Wanted"", the title track, and the synthy, bubble-gummy kiss-off ""How That Taste"", Kehlani’s full-throated vocals and live-band sound recall '90s R&amp;B groups like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_%28group%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Total</a>. But the album also strays to lots of other places: into jazzy, new jack swing-influenced R&amp;B, straight-ahead devotion hymns (penultimate stomper ""Bright""), capital-P pop ballads (closer ""Alive"", which would not sound out of place in a current adult-contemporary rotation). It’s this unabashed ambition that makes <i>You Should Be Here</i> resonate long after one has internalized its motivational urges (""Can't nobody love somebody that do not love themselves"") and tender observations on the mechanics of relationships (see the wistful ""Unconditional""). That Kehlani manages to breathe new life into these sounds and romantic musings is inspirational. She keeps telling people to follow her lead, too—just refer to the album’s title<i>.</i></span></p></div>"|20543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20543-you-should-be-here/|7.4|Matthew Ramirez

We can quibble about the particulars—are robots cool? sure, robots are cool—but in practice, there is no arguing that sci-fi is not cool. Even the Sci-Fi Channel hedged its bet and changed its name to Syfy. I am talking about dimly lit basements and damp, beige convention centers: these are not cool spaces. But Nosaj Thing, god bless him, has done his best to rebuke that notion, to find the sexiness buried under the jumpsuits. Along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>, the <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> continuum, a bunch of West Coast glitch-hop, and their spiritual forefather, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"">El-P</a>, Nosaj creates music that evokes at once the infinite blackness of deep space and the curving, gleaming chrome that moves through it. It is what plays when you type ""Andromeda galaxy"" in as your Uber destination.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fated</i> is Jason Chung’s third album in six years, and, zoomed out, it’s not so much an evolution as a continuation of the style he’s established. There’s an unearthly sense of calm to the entire affair: the beats skitter, sure, but the hi-hats on ""Erase"" sound like they’re echoing through an empty hull, not going haywire. Opener ""Sci"" takes a minute to breathe to life, runs a finger down some Vangelis chimes, then takes a minute to slowly retire. (At 2:22, it’s one of the longer tracks here.) Listen closer, though, and you can hear the progression Chung’s made over time, perhaps most clearly by looking at the series of ""Light"" tracks that stretch through to his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13251-drift/"">first record</a>. ""Light #1"", from 2009, recalls the laser-fire panic of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22487-ikonika/"">Ikonika</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14131-contact-love-want-have/"">debut</a>, which would come out the next year; 2013’s ""Light 3"", which closed off the warmer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17557-home/""><i>Home</i></a>, looked toward '90s drum'n'bass while still making room for keening, heart-sick melodies; this album’s ""Light 5"" is a series of de-escalating pulses, at times registering as little more than a heartbeat.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fated</i>, in other words, is Chung’s case for himself as one of hip-hop’s preeminent modern minimalists, and the results are frequently sublime. You can imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"">Thom Yorke</a> hearing the pattering melancholy of ""Medic"" and quietly snapping his copy of<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15149-the-king-of-limbs/"">King of Limbs</a></i> over his knee. The otherworldly Primo boom-bap of ""Realize"", at 90 seconds, almost evokes the Midnight Eez or one of Dilla’s dusty old beat tapes, were it not for the wheezing cyborg synthesizers. All of the sonic choices on previous records were similarly meticulous, but here they’re assembled with the almost architectural grace of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> composition. While <i>Fated</i> follows a direct throughline from earlier Nosaj Thing albums, one can also draw a clear line to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18537-oneohtrix-point-never-r-plus-seven/""><i>R Plus Seven</i></a>’s fixation on dated computer tones, as well as its sense of slow-burn, alien awe. This is not without its dangers. Splitting the difference between ambient and hip-hop is generally a fast track toward adderall-core study music—shout out to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29657-blue-sky-black-death/"">Blue Sky Black Death</a>—and, to be fair, <i>Fated</i> is an overwhelmingly <i>pleasant</i> listen. It is decidedly un-dazzling.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-e18a2932-2472-9a9d-aa99-dedc871976c1"">But quiet doesn’t mean it can’t also be daring. So many of Nosaj Thing’s contemporaries deal with in-the-red maximalism, all hyper-compressed drums and lens-flare dynamics. But while FlyLo looked at <i>Blade Runner</i> and saw great plumes of fire and neon street fights, Nosaj Thing saw something else: two robots falling in love. Accordingly, <i>Fated</i>’s deeply electronic soundscape is most striking for its humanity. Throughout the record, Chung extracts vocal lines like threads of gossamer, treating human voices like violas to bow in much the same way that, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"">Prefuse 73</a> treated them as toms to thwack. On ""Cold Stares"", the most vocal track of Nosaj Thing’s discography, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a> charts the dark corners of this possibility space, musing and sighing and crooning in a robot-human duet. This is a very small sort of revolution, suggesting, like Spike Jonze’s <i>Her</i>, that the delineations between hard sci-fi and soft sci-fi might not be so rigid, and that our transhumanist future might still find room for some of life’s more corporeal pleasures.</span></p></div>"|20559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20559-nosaj-thing-fated/|7.2|Clayton Purdom

Start with the cover, which is a pretty girl in a field, her image washed out, soaked in amber and obscured by a spiderwebbed glass. She’s real, but she’ll be forever out of reach, and this is exactly the kind of feeling Turnover evoke over and over again here, with just enough reverb and treated guitar to create distance and depth around every pensive daydream. If you’re into the idea of planning a mix to commemorate the girl that <i>will</i> get away, there's about seven songs here that can get you started.</p>
<p>Quite the coincidence that <i>Peripheral Vision</i> shares a very similar name as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31620-title-fight/http://pitchfork.com/artists/31620-title-fight/"">Title Fight</a>’s risky, triumphant reinvention <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20173-hyperview/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20173-hyperview/""><i>Hyperview</i></a>, as well as its producer. In each instance,<span> </span>a traditionalist punk band goes headfirst into more aqueous forms of indie rock, but retain qualities which put them at an advantage over the countless wan, limp bands who decided to sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths"">the Smiths</a> from the beginning.</p>
<p>In Turnover's case, their pop punk past is nipping at their heels: Their <a href=""https://turnover.bandcamp.com/album/turnover"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut EP</a> justly earned the tag, and even after 2013’s <a href=""https://turnover.bandcamp.com/album/magnolia-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Magnolia</i></a> smoothed out some of their more Warped Tour affectations, they were doing shows with Dashboard Confessional 2.0, This Wild Life, and the <span>perpetually short-pantsed,</span> hair-gelled schlubs in New Found Glory as recently as last month. But you can tell that they come to their new sound from a realm that prizes vocal, lyrical and sonic clarity<span>—</span>Austin Getz's vocals are unusually upfront and legible for this style of music, and Will Yip’s production is crystalline and sleek. ""Radio-friendly"" is mostly theoretical in 2015, but Yip tends to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31791-tigers-jaw"">work</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31541-balance-and-composure"">with</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32561-pianos-become-the-teeth"">bands</a> who've managed to find young, dedicated, merch-buying audiences who still believe in the idea of big-tent alternative rock as a refuge.</p>
<p>And so you hear a lot of atypically crowd-pleasing, extroverted maneuvers here—the gorgeous opening reverie of ""Cutting My Fingers Off"" is blown open by a bridge of pulse-quickening drum rolls similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/543-brand-new/"">Brand New</a>’s ""Sic Transit Gloria…"" or any given <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky"">Explosions in the Sky</a> song. The chorus of ""Take My Head"" is florid, AP English self-pity delivered as a pop punk shout-along, ""Humming"" is sophisticated bedsit pop that expresses the same desires as ""Dixieland Delight"" or ""Chattahoochee"", minus the geographical signifiers.</p>
<p>But just as often, the gap between where Turnover is and where they want to be is painfully obvious. Throughout, Getz's lyrics are either effective or seriously awkward and there’s very little in between. He's earnest enough when he's fussing over his transition into adulthood (""New Scream"", ""Hello Euphoria""), but just as often, he's reading off Robert Smith flashcards, his imagery full of dissolution, disintegration, dizziness, disappearance and descent<span>—</span>you get pretty much all of the above during ""Dizzy on the Comedown"", which reveals the wisdom of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing"">Wild Nothing</a> who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8902-wild-nothing/"">purposefully go blank on lyrics</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its stylistic reverence, <i>Peripheral Vision</i> can actually be novel when Turnover most resemble their previous incarnation. On ""Diazepam"", Getz emasculates himself as a preemptive strike against the inevitable—""Your father doesn’t like me ‘cause I’m not into sports/ And your mother won’t approve because I’m not of the cross/ I took an upper before your sister’s wedding just to help me pretend,"" creating a heretofore-unfathomable nexus between Blink-182 and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500"">Galaxie 500</a>. And then there’s ""I Would Hate You If I Could"". Think of your favorite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"">Real Estate</a> song. One of the really <i>chill</i> ones like ""Green Aisles"" or ""Pool Swimmers"". And then, instead of a chorus reminiscing about the simple, bittersweet pleasures of suburban life or the challenges of fatherhood, how about the bitter memories of rough sex with your ex, pinning her against the wall and trying not to wake her roommates. They still <i>sound</i> like Turnover’s application to <a href=""http://www.capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a> finishing school, but retain pop punk’s main lyrical drivers of social and sexual insecurity.</p>
<p>It's hard to figure out an appropriate emotional reaction to the raw, honest, and unsympathetic character in ""I Would Hate You If I Could"". Perhaps the message is that even as your tastes in music mature, getting fucked over in a relationship hurts as much as it does when you’re 16. That’s not <i>supposed</i> to be the enduring message of <i>Peripheral Vision, </i>at least not according to Getz. He explained the album’s overarching theme as, <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/03/11/turnovers-cutting-my-fingers-off-is-a-wistful-guitar-jam"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I always remember things better than they were and miss people more than I should.""</a> Those are the feelings this music is meant to convey, but as a document of a young band in a sharp and tricky growth spurt, <i>Peripheral Vision</i> still can’t hide how messy and complicated real life can get.</p></div>"|20446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20446-peripheral-vision/|6.6|Ian Cohen

<p dir=""ltr""><i>Global</i> is Rundgren’s small-u utopia album, dressing up his meditations on the environment, feminism, civil rights and community in synth-slicked rock and post-rave sonics, recalling 1993’s techno manifesto <i>No World Order</i>—albeit, mercifully, without the attempts at rapping. (And much like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1EUir4qTCE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>his tour for that album</span></a>, Rundgren’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lejs6c7wp8w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current stage set</a> is more superclub throwdown than a rock show, with the singer flanked by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"">Dâm-Funk</a> and choreographed dancers.) But it’s an album where the timely, ripped-from-Twitter lyrics—complete with references to Miley Cyrus and Malala Yousafzai—clash awkwardly with the dated sound.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For a record so topically consumed with the here-and-now, <i>Global</i> feels like it could’ve come out over a quarter century ago: with its gated-reverb drums, robo-filtered vocal hooks, and arena-rock chug, the opening ""Evrybody"" recalls the Reagan-era moment when '60s veterans started lacquering up old standards <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=def3ob2h-1s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with '80s production gloss</a>. ""Blind"", meanwhile, rails against bible-thumping, climate change-denying Republicans over boudoir-summoning soft-rock, complete with a Sanbornian saxgasm. Perhaps <i>Global</i>’s anachronistic sound is Rundgren’s way of emphasizing that the issues he’s addressing were just as pressing three decades ago and we’re still no further ahead. But even more tasteful production couldn’t redeem the goofiness of ""Earth Mother"", a salute to famous female activists torpedoed by rote songcraft and hackneyed lyrics. (""We got a little bit too much testosterone/ Need a little more progesterone."")</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Rundgren was the rare rocker of his vintage to embrace electronics early on (he was eagerly heralding <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybWRodOpoDQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the death of rock'n'roll</a> as far back as 1975), but <i>Global</i> finds him trumpeting the music’s transformative, communal virtues like a neophyte who’s just come back from his first Burning Man, resulting in tracks (see: ""Global Nation"") that resemble advertising jingles for Euro-trance compilations. Likewise, the acid-house throb of ""Flesh and Blood"" doesn’t simply flaunt the influence of EDM, it’s <i>about</i> EDM; as Rundgren marvels at ""the bang-bang-banging of a drum machine"" and ""the thunderous groove,"" he comes off like a glowstick-twirling Marv Albert doing play-by-play from the middle of a rave. When Rundgren dials down the bluster, <i>Global</i> yields moments of understated beauty: the addiction-themed ""Fate"" boasts a dreamily ascendant chorus, and the soft-focus ""Soothe"" has enough genuine ache to cut through its '80s movie-montage sheen.

<p dir=""ltr"">If <i>Global</i> overwhelms its four-minute songs with conflicting aesthetics, <i>Runddans</i> encounters the opposite problem: it unfurls across an IMAX-sized canvas, but struggles to stretch out its concept to fill the space.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>For its first half at least, </span><i>Runddans</i><span> lives up to its big-event billing. Its movements are arranged along a loose cycle-of-life narrative that conflates childbirth with spiritual awakening (sample title: ""Liquid Joy From the Womb of Infinity""), with the scene set by an entrancing swirl of oscillating electronics, gong-crash eruptions, and wordless vocals. The moment of birth is marked by Rundgren’s first utterance of <i>Runddans</i>’ central lyric—""I have waited for this moment for what seems like nine lifetimes/ You will never be closer than you are now/ Put your arms around me""—like a parent casting his eyes upon his newborn for the first time; tears of joy spring forth in the form of a gushing guitar solo set atop a celestial disco groove.</span></p>

But while </span><i>Rundanns</i><span> has all the makings of a late-career triumph, it’s less a new watermark for Rundgren’s sprawling discography than an analog to it: beautiful and baffling in equal measure, all over the map, and beholden to nothing but its own inexplicable logic. </span></span></p></div>"|20349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20349-runddans/|3.8|Stuart Berman

On two previous albums as the Weather Station, Lindeman used acoustic guitars, banjos and a lexicon of bucolic imagery to write graceful, generous folk songs. The material wasn’t simple so much as vernacular, so that even the Toronto songwriter’s most intense reflections on love and lust <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8788-border-crossing/4/"" target=""_blank"">espoused a downhome familiarity.</a></p>
<p>But <i>Loyalty</i>, Lindeman’s third and best LP, continues the inward pull of last year’s incisive EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19825-weather-station-what-am-i-going-to-do-with-everything-i-know/""><i>What Am I Going to Do with Everything I Know</i></a>. Her once-plaintive confessionals have morphed into intimate but impressionistic character studies, where the songwriter spares neither herself nor her subjects an analytical eye. And the acoustic instruments that once galloped or crept behind her have morphed into abstract backdrops—sophisticated but understated settings that accent the expressive voice above them. <i>Loyalty</i> feels like a 40-minute glimpse into a secret world, where familiar people (sisters, mothers, lovers) and traditional sounds (a fingerpicked guitar, a patient piano) lead intriguing, uncanny lives. It’s a place that demands to be revisited.</p>
<p>To make <i>Loyalty</i>,<i> </i>Lindeman and a minimal crew decamped to a deteriorating French mansion for a long wintertime recording session. Collaboration has long been integral to the Weather Station’s records, from a set of duets released in 2013 to the way in which <i>Everything</i> was recorded by two different bands in two different countries. But only <a href=""http://www.bahamasmusic.net"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bahamas leader and multi-instrumentalist Afie Jurvanen</a> and accomplished engineer Robbie Lackritz joined Lindeman <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Frette+Studios/@48.980431,2.17532,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5013ee899e841e73?sa=X&amp;ei=SIFHVfy2O9PAgwTu64CQCw&amp;ved=0CGsQ_BIwCg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">along the Seine</a>. They shared production duties, while Lindeman and Jurvanen split a dozen instruments evenly. These 11 songs often suggest you’re sitting with the trio in some small parlor as they play. The drums shuffle or canter quietly. The guitars stay hushed. The only real instrumental break, the smoldering electric coda at the end of ""Tapes"", remains gentle, hinting at an outburst but never delivering it. And whether hitting the brassy highs of ""I Could Only Stand By"" or the diffident lows of ""Personal Eclipse"", Lindeman’s voice rarely rises above an elegant whisper. It’s as if she’s trusting these revelations only to the people in the room.</p>
<p>All of this material indeed seems confidential, like a list of life problems that Lindeman is still trying to sort out for herself. Opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17336-weather-station-way-it-is-way-it-could-be/"">""Way It Is, Way It Could Be""</a> sets the stage for this exacting ambiguity, where the uncertainty of the future unspools from a discrete, difficult present. Here, a relationship is good but neither as honest nor forgiving as she hopes. The partnership’s survival suggests a Schrödinger’s cat scenario, where Lindeman can simultaneously envision success and failure. During ""Personal Eclipse"", she takes stock of her general discomfort with society—its catcalling men, her introversion amid others’ extroversion, the loneliness such tension can induce—and tries to tease out its source. It’s an open-ended self-evaluation, with more lingering questions than actual answers. And ""Like Sisters"" questions the limits of friendship and choosing sides, even when it imperils your own happiness. ""Sometimes you give, you’re giving all you have,"" she offers, stretching those last words with what sounds like regret. ""And sometimes you’re the taker.""</p>
<p>The detail-oriented approach that delighted on the Weather Station’s early records reappears on <i>Loyalty</i>. Mesas are ""strange and red and snowy."" Rivers are ""serpentine, glinting."" The low sunlight of November is ""impossibly bright."" Paired with the external turmoil and internal debate of these lyrics and the private way Lindeman and Jurvanen deliver them, such observations give <i>Loyalty </i>the feeling of fastidiously edited old journal entries—too lean and evocative to be a first draft, but still true to experience. It’s an approach that puts Lindeman in the company of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Bill Callahan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a>, songwriters whose careful combinations of pedestrian details and profound insights also created secret, self-sovereign worlds. And like both of those songwriters, she’s a singer with an unmistakable and communicative voice, able to convey hope and hurt with equal clarity.</p>
<p>During standout ""I Mined"", Lindeman admits she is stuck: There’s a fundamental but indiscernible flaw in her current relationship. It’s the pea beneath the mattress that keeps her up at night, even as the seasons come and go. She alternately wants to find and fix it or just forget it and carry on. But she knows that’s impossible. ""Your trouble is like a lens through which the whole world bends,"" she confides over prismatic piano, her voice suddenly harmonizing with itself as if to emphasize that this is the record’s thesis. ""And you can’t set it straight again."" These 11 tunes are expressions of woes that you can’t quite correct but can’t let go, either, worries that plague you but push you onward, too. These are public folk songs about the private problems—breakups and makeups, depressions and deaths—we’ve all suffered.</p></div>"|20330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20330-loyalty/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

Jazz, who also goes by Jacuzzi La Fleur, has managed to build a sizable local fan base—still rare in a city long referred to by local artists as <a href=""http://www.thelegendsleague.com/blog/2013/12/19/toronto-the-screwface-capital/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Screwface Capital</a>—by establishing a grimier counter-narrative to Drake’s opulent, uptown vision of a city newly christened <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9605-views-from-the-6-inside-drakes-toronto/"">The Six</a>. On his polished debut album, <i>Marauding in Paradise</i>, he deploys the new nickname just once, on ""Local Celebrity Freestyle"", setting up his own us-vs-them, downtown/uptown dichotomy: ""I’m from Toronto, but they call it the Six.""</p>
<p>But <i>Marauding </i>isn’t antagonistic: it just offers a counterpoint, a glimpse into a different, younger subset of Toronto’s art and party scene. Living in a city giddy off one man’s come up, Jazz prefers to move to the sound of his own voice. And his elegant, elastic bark is loud and clear: The best moments on <i>Marauding</i> are fearless, theatrical. Jazz assumes the bluster of a corner preacher on ""Guardian Angel"" and gives the intro track about soured relationships a gothic vibe, reminiscent of the skits on early Dungeon Family records. (After a brief verse, the song tumbles into a snippet from Mista’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5mFh8MhKeU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blackberry Molasses""</a>, confirming the allusion.) Elsewhere, on ""New Religion"" and ""Holy Shit"", he’s unafraid to shriek, wail and growl into the mic.</p>
<p>To allow <i>Marauding</i> a chance to connect, you have to push past some of the overt sonic and aesthetic allusions to Houston rapper Travis Scott, which compromise the sound of an original voice shining through. On the evidence of <i>Marauding</i>, however, we should give ‘Cuzzi some time to distill this influence. There’s exciting trial-and-error happening everywhere on the album: His willingness to play with flows, his eye for detail, a surprising grip of giddy, geeky quips (""I’m Kanye with shrugs""; rhyming Dom Perignon with M. Night Shyamalan) and the ability to work with his right-hand-man producer, Lantz. Together, they temper the record’s sometimes-overwhelming maximalism at the right moments. </p>
<p>The tape lacks a signature song, one that sums up the world Jazz lives in and invites us in. ""Switch"" and ""The Downtown Cliché"" feature the on-trend pairing of bottom-feeding bass/triplet cavalcades. Lantz distills a variety of vibes, from post-trap bangers and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31498-partynextdoor/"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a>-style bedroom soul to Easy Mo Bee boom bap and the Vine-brittle blap of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UED4WqwNU1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Terio’s theme song</a>. Most compelling are his transitions, particularly on songs like the beautiful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"">Toro Y Moi</a> flip, ""Rose Quartz/Like, Crazy"", and ""Flashiago/A Sober Drowning"".</p>
<p>Here are some things we learn about Jacuzzi from <i>Marauding, </i>though: he is, or has been, a drug-addled party kid and a lovesick lothario, and has gone from being the only black kid in an Idaho classroom to too expensive for your features. It’s not easy to inhabit these identities on a single album—let alone your first—but Jazz is agile enough to pull it off and, like Toronto, he’s still growing.</p></div>"|20556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20556-marauding-in-paradise/|7.3|Anupa Mistry

Django Django's hodgepodge approach and affectless harmonizing made the Beta Band reference, in particular, hard to avoid (it probably didn't hurt that drummer/producer David Maclean’s brother used to be <i>in</i> Beta Band). But as a jumping-off point, these influences are limited, and the possibilities of the sound taper off the second you start to repeat yourself or lose your sense of irreverence. On <i>Born Under Saturn</i>, Django Django fall into both traps.</p>
<p>Even so, their range of raw skill is impressive. The songs present themselves as physical challenges: Can Django Django give <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyCjTj0aAQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Metronomic Underground""</a> a jamband reworking? ""Giant"" says ""yes."" Can they repurpose surf-guitar riffs without actually making surf-rock? ""Shake and Tremble"" pulls off that trick. Can the juddering bassline of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7749-big-boi"">Big Boi</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11876-shutterbugg/""><br/>""Shutterbugg""</a> coexist with monklike harmonies? ""First Light"" answers in affirmative. But can Django Django juxtapose starched-stiff British accents against vibrant Caribbean rhythms? There’s a thirteen-minute stretch stuck right in the middle of <i>Born Under Saturn, </i>from ""Reflections"" to ""Shot Down"",<i> </i>that emphatically states ""no.""</p>
<p>More so than their woolier debut, <i>Born Under Saturn</i> is a demonstration of what Django Django can <i>do</i> rather than what they have to say or how they feel. The almost-constant harmonizing of Vincent Neff’s staid vocals surround these songs in a case of stained glass, lovely but nearly impenetrable. Hammer away enough at the album and some kind of center emerges: ""High Moon"" <i>might</i> be about restorative nocturnal powers, ""Shot Down"" <i>might</i> be a crime narrative, and <i>maybe</i> the album title is meant to suggest a motif of planetary influence and rebirth that gets vaguely touched upon throughout.</p>
<p>But Neff lends not a speck of vibrato, grit or inflection to anything, and thus, not a speck of urgency or instability or any emotional resonance. The busy arrangements and serious frontloading make <i>Born Under Saturn</i>’s 54 minutes a demanding investment, and the effort it takes to simply get any sort of visceral pleasure out of it makes it feel twice as long.</p>
<p>And so the best record Django Django may end up putting their name on is <a href=""http://latenighttales.co.uk/product.php/227/django-django"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2014’s Late Night Tales</a> compilation. It tells you everything about the band that <i>Born Under Saturn does</i>: they see themselves in the lineage of late-'60s, early-'70s pop weirdos, but they listen like modernist samplers and crate diggers<span>—</span>witness the inclusion of Bob James’ endlessly resourced <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BP1_1DpeBE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nautilus""</a>. A telling and exciting three-song stretch includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>’s supervillainous cover of John Holt’s rocksteady classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S71_vIMQ0YY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Man Next Door""</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"">TNGHT</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13589-buggn"">""Bugg’n""</a> and <i>Stankonia</i> deep cut <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC4Tym60rSY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slum Beautiful""</a>. All of those acts have likewise been lauded for their omnivorous artistry and loved because their songs have distinct character and hooks. Django Django are clearly inspired by them, but when I think about how they fit amongst their most frequent comparisons in the UK Class of 2000, I remember <i>SPIN</i>'s infamous pick for album of the year: something that also packed an incredible amount of musical information in a small space but was only as lovable as its input. It was <a href=""http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/spinend.htm#2000"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""your hard drive""</a>, and unfortunately, <i>that</i> might be the best likeness for Django Django.</p></div>"|20509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20509-born-under-saturn/|5.6|Ian Cohen

Over the course of three <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9457-awesome-color/"">promising</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12097-electric-aborigines/"">but</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14030-massa-hypnos/"">frustrating</a> albums with his prior band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4938-awesome-color/"">Awesome Color</a>, the singer/guitarist drove himself into a ditch of Detroit retro-worship. The primal, sexual, radical sounds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">the Stooges</a> and the MC5 were Awesome Color’s paint-by-numbers palette, but aside from kicking out a few sweaty, muscular jams, the Michigan-bred band never managed to creep out from under the shadows of their granddads, let alone retool that sound for a new frame of reference. If someone cooks up a <i>Motown: The Musical</i>-style tribute to Detroit’s late-'60s/early-'70s rock scene, Stanton could lead the house band. That’s not entirely a compliment.</p>
<p>Stanton managed to find new footing last year with <i>Can’t Love</i>, the full-length debut by his new band, Turn to Crime. With new collaborators Ian Saylor and Dorian Foerg, he’s modified his basic Detroit-centric approach. As on <i>Can’t Love</i>, Turn to Crime’s new album <i>Actions</i> strips away the massive, spastic guitars of Awesome Color in favor of a sculptural, hollowed-out thrum. Instead of finding a new method by which to draw inspiration from his influences, though, Stanton has simply modified that list. It’s not a dramatic shift. <i>Action</i> primarly sets itself apart by doing to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a> exactly what Awesome Color did to the Stooges: mimicking them. ""This Is What You Wanted"" smears swirls of synths over a stiff, faux-motorik beat that misses the tension between organic and inorganic that made Suicide so astounding. </p>
<p>Things get worse on<b> ""</b>Impatience"", an appropriately named drone that’s about as transfixing as cough syrup dripping from a spoon. The song has the cruelty to stop cold after four minutes, only to lurch back to life and trudge on for another nerve-deadening minute and a half. ""Prince of Slackers"" tries harder, with its loose-lipped, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a> sneer, but its clattering guitars and cardboard-box beat result in the unfortunate—and possibly accidental—outcome of sounding like a half-assed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">Strokes</a> demo.</p>
<p>As with Awesome Color’s collected output, there are glimpses of brilliance on <i>Actions.</i> Stanton’s barbed-wire guitar solo on ""Light"" is a spasm of inspired lunacy; the underwater funk of ""Without a Care"" has a breezily goofy hook to it. The title track is a dead ringer for Iggy’s Berlin period, all chilled melody and Bowie-indebted atmospherics, but stops short of being a rehash. An entire album of such stuff could be beautiful. But ""Feels Right"" highlights Stanton's deficiencies as a lyricist. ""If it feels right/ Then it is right,"" he chants throughout the song’s eight-and-a-half-minute run time. The dedication to such a banal bit of druggy sloganeering doesn’t translate into much; it just seems lazy. But hey, if it feels right, right?</p>
<p>Stanton and crew clearly adore the styles of music they emulate. But they refuse—or are simply unable—to ignite with a spark of their own. That is, after all, what groups like the Stooges and Suicide were all about: annihilating shit to see what might spring up in its ashes. When it comes to retroactivity in music, there’s spirited revivalism, and there’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHg-m-2ahCc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Time-Life oldies infomercial nostalgia</a>. With <i>Actions</i>, Stanton inches closer to the latter.</p></div>"|20512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20512-actions/|5.1|Jason Heller

Like everything that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32520-a-g-cook/"">A. G. Cook</a>’s London-based label’s released since 2013, these 10 songs are invocations of the hyperreal, created to meet the anxieties of an age where bodies are rarely written about as sites of joy or authenticity, and more frequently discussed as zones of inequity, violence, embarrassment and pain. The desire to exist as a well-tended garden of pixels fuels many of our culture’s dominant systems: the databases of altered thoughts, distorted images, the avatars that demonstrate reaction or stand in for action. Like all of these networks and products, PC Music answers our desire to escape the burden of physical presence—and in the process ends up sharpening and perpetuating the desire even further.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Both a label and a self-contained genre, PC Music is constructed from deep abstractions of pop and experimental electronic music; its building blocks are the musical equivalent of emoji, symbols that replace words that replace voices. It’s an airbrushed articulation of digital life in all its silly, beautiful, desperate triviality; it has an avant-garde surface but is reactionary in its bones. Sonically, it’s a response to today’s alarmingly easy production glosses, the intense plurality of sub-subgenres that flourish online. If pop’s basic work is to grab you by the heart, PC Music flips and disses that aim completely. The label’s sound resembles what aliens would produce if they sunk a jukebox in acid and then tried, from the randomized wreckage, to communicate some version of love. Instead of affection, they’ll give you a heart-shaped simulacrum—and maybe, as suggests PC Music, that’s what you wanted after all. When physical presence is a source of so much complication, sometimes an abstraction is the only thing a person can bear.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A test of the boundaries, possibilities and limitations of this ultra-focused aesthetic, <i>PC Music Volume 1</i> compresses two years of work into a half-hour. Taken together, the rapturous, nightmarish cartoon corpus is maddeningly effective; it solidifies PC Music’s ability to only produce strong reactions, whether starry-eyed captivation or powerful revulsion or a nauseating juxtaposition of both poles. There’s a meaningful spectrum of approaches within the PC Music ethos—classical composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32521-danny-l-harle/"">Danny L Harle</a>’s ""In My Dreams"" has a heartbreakingly soft, sweet, harmonic gravity, while A. G. Cook’s alter ego <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32526-lipgloss-twins/"">Lipgloss Twins</a>’ ""Wannabe"" is a chopped-up, anti-melodic spatter of brand names and robot garble—but there’s a relentless logical consistency to the sound. Every track feels almost auto-generated, scrambled, which makes the human precision in each arrangement even more eerie: PC Music sounds chaotic but is sneakily minimalist, deliberate to the last distorted note.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The calculation behind this effect is a large part of what makes it monstrous: it’s the sound of whimsy without spontaneity, lightness without joy, longing without knowledge, aggression with no object. It’s a dollhouse universe, for female voices and female figures only. The male producers and artists are controllingly invisible in PC Music, and it’s hard to say whether that’s a real aesthetic constraint or a deliberate large-scale perpetuation of the idea of women as powerless, squeaky, sweet. The genre, anyway, has been slapped with labels of ""gender appropriation,"" and the sound does feel awkwardly, distinctly male sometimes, in its ""</span><span>South Park""</span><span>-ish warehouse artlessness. But, if anyone’s really in drag here, it’s humans pretending to be avatars—the total elision of soul.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like a Kardashian, PC Music cannot be insulted by the word ""contrived."" PC Music is deeply contrived; it’s fake as hell, that’s the point, that’s the entire energy. But this ethos, of course, has its limits. PC Music only works when its theoretical intention lines up with its physical effect: when you listen to it and become instantly depersonalized, blissfully and bubbly, more pixel than flesh. The best route to this end naturally centers on pleasure. In <i>Volume 1</i>, the pastel jelly-bean melodies and baby-girl anime coos of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32263-hannah-diamond/"">Hannah Diamond</a>’s ""Every Night"" and A. G. Cook’s ""Beautiful"" reach this synthetic liftoff; the two pair up again for ""Keri Baby"", a maniacally playful track with a stormy bassline, a bubble noise vamping, a refrain of ""Give it to the girl/ Give it to the girl/ Give it to the cutest girl."" The closing track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32528-easyfun"">easyFun</a>’s ""Laplander"", is transcendent: all simulated mechanical longing, synth squeaks and stilted voices reaching for ecstasy. In tracks that are less joyful—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32522-gfoty/"">GFOTY</a>’s ""Don’t Wanna / Let’s Do It"", for example—the self-perpetuating darkness and denial that PC Music draws on gets a little too clear for comfort.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-0de75ac9-0afb-8cfd-6cae-416cb7c24e21""><span>PC Music is escapism whose primary effect is to remind us of what we’re trying to escape. We can’t trade body for avatar; we can’t displace longing forever. But for the space of an album—the sheer forcefulness of this intention smashed into a dizzy half-hour span—the sincerity within our most fundamentally artificial impulses comes calling. You wish you didn’t live in a world that produced PC Music, but you do—and because you do, thank the god in the machine for PC Music. It’ll come whispering and screaming in an absolute vacuum; it’s a party reconstituted long after anyone’s been there to laugh. It’s empty, and yet somehow the stakes are monumental.

Their energy comes from punk but their style comes from somewhere older and more obscure—a Victorian attic, maybe, or the kind of basement where the band’s singer Frances Quinlan got turned onto punk in the first place.</p>
<p>This was ten years ago or so. Quinlan had just graduated from high school and was touring around with a folk record influenced by playful, sharp-witted writers like <a href=""pitchfork.com:artists:3096-joanna-newsom"">Joanna Newsom</a> and <a href=""pitchfork.com:artists:1227-kimya-dawson"">Kimya Dawson</a>. The record, <i>Freshman Year</i>, felt cute and warm but took dark turns into the nightmare logic of children—one song, called ""Bruno Is Orange"", is sung from the perspective of a girl who fears that the government is going to put her friend in jail because the two of them kissed.</p>
<p>Eventually, Quinlan formed a band with her brother Mark and a bassist named Tyler Long and assumed a sound that filtered Quinlan’s storytelling through the rough, emotionally unguarded approach of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3575-rilo-kiley/"">Rilo Kiley</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"">Bright Eyes</a>—bands who turned diary entries into anthems and vulnerability into a shuddering kind of power. Their first album, 2012’s <i>Get Disowned</i>, is a messy world where people stomp on old floorboards for percussion and saw violins like they were made of something stronger than wood. Everything is governed by Quinlan, who sings in the wild voice of someone casting out demons (or having the demon cast out of them). Its second song, <a href=""https://hopalong.bandcamp.com/track/tibetan-pop-stars"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tibetan Pop Stars""</a>, should be etched in titanium and shot into outer space for safekeeping.</p>
<p><i>Painted Shut</i> is cleaner but just as purposeful. The album was produced by John Agnello, who has also worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"">the Hold Steady</a>—bands who play full-blooded classic rock with an idiosyncratic slant. (Quinlan once ended an <a href=""http://dieangry.com/2014/05/30/qa-with-frances-quinlan-of-hop-along/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> by thanking Neil Young and the nature documentarian David Attenborough, both of whom have fascinated stoners and gentlefolk alike for decades.) For as bullish and dramatic as the music seems, the songs here often escalate for several minutes before making a point you think they’ve already made, like a series of false floors that open to bigger and bigger rooms.</p>
<p>Quinlan is a sharp writer who understands the poetry of deflection, of putting herself to the side of the drama instead of in the middle. ""Powerful Man"" tells the story of a parent hitting their child from the perspective of a teenage bystander: ""Your dad told you not to look at me/ Down came the fists hard upon your head,"" she sings, no special inflection. ""I was the only other adult around/ I was the only other adult around."" What might’ve been just another routine tragedy becomes an exploration of guilt and responsibility. After all, Quinlan can do something about the situation but the kid can’t.</p>
<p><i>Painted Shut</i> is being released on <a href=""http://saddle-creek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saddle Creek</a>, a label built on the kind of romantic, middle-American indie that made Hop Along possible in the first place—music more indebted to the 1970s than the 1980s, more to the earnest mythologizing of folk than the grandstanding of rock, more to the fantasias of Edward Gorey and e.e. cummings than to the flash of the city; music for rickety houses in college towns and the lonelyhearts who collect in their corners like dust and give each other stick-and-pokes. I’d say it all seems old-fashioned but it has been this way for about 25 years and seems part of a longer continuum all the time, so who knows.</p>
<p>My favorite song here is a dusky, countryish ballad called “Horseshoe Crabs”. “Hey did you hear me, mom? Baby’s headed home,” Quinlan sings. “Against your wishes I went into the woods alone.” She goes on to tell us about concrete things: A pellet gun, a broken nose, a Jackson C. Frank song played for a college kid on his nylon-string guitar. Nothing seems to mean much alone but it accrues a kind of magical importance, a collection of almosts-but-not-quites. <span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, serif;""><span>Heartbreak here isn't an abstraction but an event, one in which something falls on the ground and breaks and nobody seems to have the wherewithal to put it back together. </span></span>As for the Jackson C. Frank song, Quinlan barely makes it through, but like all the failures documented on <i>Painted Shut</i> she still manages to sound triumphant singing about it. </p></div>"|20398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20398-painted-shut/|7.9|Mike Powell

As his Instagram <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/2FnspiSQaC/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">teasers</a> and leaked YouTube snippets suggest, Chief Keef's official releases are just the tip of a massive recorded archive. But Keef is interested in what he's doing <i>today</i>, not what he's done; new projects make his old work irrelevant. Many of his songs, long-forgotten evidence of a particular tributary of his evolution, lay dormant, unreleased, or lost—like the original version of <i>Bang 2</i>, which promised songs such as the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6aX6-VSlCw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DP Beats-produced</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsGKCP6K6Qg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Calling""</a>. Although credited to Lil Keis when it leaked—DP was locked up at the time—the song was the first in a series of collaborations between DP Beats and Chief Keef. At the time, its addictive giddiness suggested a surefire smash; now it languishes in poor quality on YouTube—burned, essentially—and Keef has long since moved on.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Almighty DP</i> <span>is a DJ-free CD-quality compilation put together by DP Beats himself, the first in a series of tapes culling the duo's work together, songs released primarily over the course of the past year. It's essential not just because the music is uniformly great—by any standard, this is one of the most consistent tapes in Keef's catalog—but because it captures a period of time in which each individual piece is in danger of being lost, released only as a low-quality YouTube snippet, or perhaps never seeing the light of day at all.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Where Young Chop built upon more maximal tendencies, DP Beats is detail-oriented, conveying more subtle shifts of mood. Though the producer is based in North Carolina, his sound has shaped the popular music of the Midwest: the enigmatic melancholy of ""Tec"" and its sour brother ""Fool Ya"" were both major regional records last summer, <span id=""docs-internal-guid-7e7e63d4-113b-f9d2-3d69-dba0fb2fa42f""><span>with ""Fool Ya"" receiving regular spins on Power 92 and cresting 8 million views on YouTube</span></span>. Though neither made an official Chief Keef project, both are included here in pristine quality, capturing drill music's recent drift into the disorienting. DP's more recent work is represented in cuts like ""Don't Love Her"" (originally intended for Keef's unreleased </span><i>Thot Breaker</i><span> project), which piles on layers of keyboard melodies to suggest a sugary rush. It's the kind of giddy thing which would normally accompany a song about a new crush, giving Keef's icy denials an ironic frame.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Many of the best records here work similarly, as miniature synthesizer symphonies that aim for synapse-overload. Though DP's work shares the same roots as the 808 Mafia formula that dominates the Southern club circuit, he's got more ideas, a more subtle sense for vibe, and ornate tastes. DP likes active snares and tricky drum programming, and Keef—in splitting the difference between rapper, auteur, and songwriter—knows how to best complement these widely varying canvases. On ""Runnin""—one of the tape's more recent records—he fits his voice right at the center of the cascading keyboards with a hooky central melody, letting the beat swirl around him. When the melody jumps up and down like a jagged EKG, as on ""Worries,"" he raps with a deadened affect.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The records which best illustrate the duo's chemistry, though, aren't always the most complex: ""Know She Does"" relies on a simple four-note melody, and its directness is euphoric. But perhaps the tape's best record—the bonus track ""Rolls"", hidden on the second half of ""All In""—is the best example of DP's ability to effortlessly juggle intricate, interlocking melodic pieces without losing sight of the bigger picture. The swarming whirlwind of sound acts as a sweet release while Keef croons in craggy autotune. But the song's success is all in the details, the way DP plays with the EQ settings, giving shape to the track that makes it less loop than song. <span>A</span><span>nyone interested in current street rap's potential for emotional breadth shouldn't miss it.</span></span></p></div>"|20502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20502-almighty-dp/|7.8|David Drake

If you want to think of that space in purely geographic terms, it's somewhere between the pop-friendly house and garage of his native London and the patient, muted techno of his adopted home, Berlin. You can also think of it as music with one foot in the club and another in the aisles of your local fast fashion emporium, living in that liminal realm between body music and headphones-oriented composition. FitzGerald isn't an innovative force by any means, but he's an expert synthesist, able to fold a wide array of influences into radiant, splashy cuts like 2013's high water mark <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJfUIO_H9Io"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Can Tell (By the Way You Move)""</a>. <i>Fading Love</i> is his first full-length release, and it's marked by a maturity that FitzGerald's earned through his time in the trenches, writing and mixing and performing dozens of live sets.</p>
<p>As part of the larger arc of FitzGerald's career, <i>Fading Love</i> is a natural step forward: it's his most writerly album to date, largely eschewing software and completely avoiding sampled vocals in favor of more rounded, organic sounds and live guest vocalists. Its best qualities are ones that typically lurk in the background of electronic music: restraint, consistency, and an eye on achieving larger thematic goals. The album is built around a relationship that fell apart, and it's appropriately overcast given that fact. There are moments where you can hear FitzGerald toying with a melody that could easily fill a club or send a festival crowd into a frenzy, only to pull back and focus on melancholy once again; ""Knife to the Heart"" is the best example, with a titanic synth line worthy of EDM's bro princes relegated to spot duty.</p>
<p>Its other highlights find a middle ground between the genteel, bookish techno of label-mate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27655-jon-hopkins/"">Jon Hopkins</a> and the ruthless pop-house of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a>, electronic music's reigning boy kings. Single ""Full Circle"" and ""Crystallise"" manage an impressive balancing act: you can imagine them slotting in on the radio somewhere, but they also don't sound quite like anything else in that sphere. Delicately constructed and heavy with emotion, they're the best examples of what FitzGerald can accomplish working in this transitional vein.</p>
<p><i>Fading Lov</i>e is set up to reward the same focus it demonstrates: if you dig into each new muted meditation and immerse yourself in FitzGerald's bubbling little temples of thought, you'll find yourself entranced. It doesn't have the same impact when it's flipped on in the background, soundtracking chores or a morning commute: then, it verges on soporific. The guest appearances by singers Oli Bayston (a.k.a. Boxed In) and Lawrence Hart don't help: they're meant to complement FitzGerald's arrangements rather than create any sort of spark. FitzGerald has <a href=""http://www.deephouseamsterdam.com/exclusive-interview-with-george-fitzgerald/2/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked about</a> playing these songs live and reaching the live proficiency of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"">Caribou</a>, an exciting prospect—it's easy to imagine the bulk of <i>Fading Love</i> blooming into something more cathartic and immediately engaging. But even in this basic state, the album is a complete statement that's comfortable in its own skin.</p></div>"|20444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20444-fading-love/|7.3|Jamieson Cox

<div><span>Like pretty much every band linked to the ""emo revival"" of the past several years, Sheffield duo </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31935-nai-harvest"" target=""_blank"">Nai Harvest</a><span> has tried to talk their way out of it. </span>In an <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1669285/band-to-watch-nai-harvest/franchises/band-to-watch/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> from last year<span>, guitarist/vocalist Ben Thompson shrugged, ""I don’t want to be picked up as an emo band in 2014 and then thrown on the floor when it’s not a trendy thing to like or talk about anymore."" The connotations and stereotypes behind that term are still a contentious hot topic (no pun intended), so it's in their best interests to keep a distance. </span><span>But it was merely part of Nai Harvest’s larger concern of being pigeonholed in any way; upon shifting to a grungier, more '90s-indebted sound on EP</span><a href=""https://naiharvest.bandcamp.com/album/hold-open-my-head"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> Hold Open My Head</i></a><span>, Nai Harvest stated they didn’t want to be classified as grunge or '90s-revival either. Though </span><i>Hairball </i><span>is far slicker and focused than their previous work, Nai Harvest's requests are still likely to fall on deaf ears: you’re more likely to misrepresent them if you </span><i>don’t</i><span> talk about the '90s.<br/><br/></span>As with their debut <a href=""https://naiharvest.bandcamp.com/album/whatever"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Whatever</i></a>, it’s an enjoyable listen <i>because</i> of its lack of innovation, rather than in spite of it. But back in 2013, Nai Harvest at least had novelty going for them: It was refreshing to hear guitarists take notes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/76-american-football"" target=""_blank"">American Football</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2777-mineral"" target=""_blank"">Mineral</a> after two straight decades of indie rock more or less acting like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a> were the only bands to exist in the '90s. However, Thompson’s twiddly, Kinsella-esque guitar figures of the past have fully given way to fuzzy, jangly open chords. Lew Currie’s zig-zagging, stop-start rhythms have now been aligned to straight-ahead sprints and brisk jogs—think of a more raw Teenage Fanclub or a punkier Ash, but certainly not any bands from the American Midwest.</div>
</div>
<p>And it does give <i>Hairball</i> a much broader appeal than <i>Whatever</i>. Freed from knotty progressions, Thompson can draw out his vocals in a nasal bray accentuated by a trebly, distorted mic—think of Liam Gallagher fronting the sort of modest UK indie band that Noel might scorn in print because they didn’t aspire to play Wembley. That said, Nai Harvest <i>does </i>have populist ambitions, as evidenced by the production of Bob Cooper, who previously worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27152-empire-of-the-sun/"">Empire of the Sun</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30673-sky-ferreira"">Sky Ferreira</a>. It’s an extreme stretch to recognize his influence without checking the credits first—there’s nothing at all glam about <i>Hairball</i>. It is, however, stylishly tousled, greasy and glossy in a way that makes you think ""Hairball"" would work as an ironic name for an expensive gel.</p>
<p>When Nai Harvest are at their most edgy and brash, ""Spin"" and ""Sick on My Heart"" provide a legitimate buzz, just the right amount of bubblegum grunge, tart pop-punk and hi-fi <i>enough </i>production. Which could translate to ""alt"" or ""1995"", though there’s a more contemporary precedent, as Nai Harvest situate themselves in the six-month span in 2010 between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"">Wavves</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14415-king-of-the-beach/""><i>King of the Beach</i> </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"">Cloud Nothings</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15031-cloud-nothings"">self-titled album</a>.</p>
<p>But the comparisons become less flattering and more revealing as <i>Hairball</i> goes forward. Dylan Baldi cannot stop writing indelible hooks, while Nathan Williams’ personality always manages to emerge whether his records sound like an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12783-wavvves"">oxidized cassette</a> or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17786-wavves-afraid-of-heights/"">million dollars</a>. Nai Harvest...well, they don’t like to be confined, but that’s something that comes across more clearly in their interviews. With barely any deviation in tempo, tone or texture, <i>Hairball</i> just wads up into an indistinguishable mass: Thompson’s vocals predictably trace over the chord progressions or they just double lead riffs. Throughout, he’s bummed about something or other, girls, growing up, himself<span>—</span>it's all part of the same malaise.</p>
<p>""Ocean of Madness"" is the standout by default, since it has an actual bassline and an appealing, ""Semi-Charmed Life""-style cadence in its bridge. But just when it appears that Nai Harvest has set itself up for the big score, Thompson offers <i>this</i> as the chorus: ""Don’t let me drown in an ocean of madness/ I wanna swim in an ocean of you."" This may be the first revelation of Thompson’s songwriting personality, as ""Gimme Gimme"" shows a similar sweet tooth for cloying power-pop. But when he sings, ""gimme gimme your sugar joy,"" it doesn't feel like sincerity, but that most unfortunate of '90s influences: sarcasm. <i>Hairball</i> is certainly an evolution for Nai Harvest, but it’s tough to really call it progress.</p></div>"|20445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20445-hairball/|5.8|Ian Cohen

Blame prog-rock for giving them a raw deal. The Danish quartet certainly had the optics to earn the tag: witness their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um3aQ8UB9HM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">magnificent hair </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9285-and-the-glass-handed-kites/"" target=""_blank"">garish</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13399-no-more-stories-are-told-today/"" target=""_blank"">album covers</a>. They've also released only two LPs in the past nine years, and one was meant to be listened to as a continuous 54-minute suite and had a 23-word poem as its title. But unlike contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2872-muse/"" target=""_blank"">Muse</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2686-the-mars-volta/"" target=""_blank"">the Mars Volta</a> or Coheed and Cambria, Mew isn’t alerting sheeple to the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAI2QOBMlTA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mindcrimes</a> of the Matrix, nor does their technical ability manifest in 64th-note runs in 11/8 time. They mostly write love songs. All of which made them one of the more unique, if not necessarily successful, rock bands on a major label in the past decade. Those days are done, but thankfully, you wouldn't know it from <i>+-</i>.</p>
<p>Despite technically being an indie rock band now, Mew brings back Michael Beinhorn as a producer, a guy who was last convinced to come out of hiding by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2544-courtney-love"" target=""_blank"">Courtney Love</a>. And that was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14178-nobodys-daughter"" target=""_blank"">five years ago</a>. If you’re unfamiliar with Beinhorn’s work, he produced <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19407-soundgarden-superunknown/"" target=""_blank"">Superunknown</a></i>, but also a lot of very, very expensive-sounding albums that would frequently sell for pennies in used CD stores throughout the '90s—we’re talking <i>Ozzmosis</i>, <i>Mechanical Animals</i>, the Verve Pipe album <i>after</i> the one with ""The Freshman"" on it.</p>
<p>As a result, +- is liable to be one of the more magnificent-<i>sounding</i> rock records you’ll hear all year: The first thing you hear is a harp, while Jonas Bjerre’s pristine vocals continue to be exempt from the inexorable march of time. There’s some serious technique at play and Beinhorn ensures you hear all of it in high definition—Bo Madsen engages in some nifty pull-off runs, Silas Utke Graae Jørgensen plays impossible-sounding fills on tom drums. There are numerous moments where Mew switch tempos and time signatures and others where it could pass as <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ysmaa9Ti3bk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Arthur on Ice</a> in Space</i>. The removal from any earthly concerns or obligations is echoed in the chorus from <i>+-</i>’s opener as Bjerre sings, ""I’d rather be a satellite.""</p>
<p>The blinding, gilded tone is charming rather than obnoxious because Mew never use their exquisite and excessive tastes to glorify themselves as rock overlords. Their songs continue to be sweet, almost twee at their core. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58121-mew-return-with-new-album-share-satellites/"" target=""_blank"">""Satellites""</a> is probably the most grandiose song ever written about ""movie night"" and Bjerre’s lyrics remain curious, obtuse and playful—""The Night Believer"" and ""Interview the Girls"" spin elaborate conceits out of what sound like true stories at their core, and somehow work on both the mundane and fantastical levels.</p>
<p>A gushing romanticism unifies both the lyrics and the music itself, which takes Mew past black lights and dry ice and into the neons and pastels of '80s pop cinema. ""Making Friends"" is a startling foray into cocktail-hour jazz, replete with stiff, Quincy Jones-style riffs. Both Bjerre and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32335-kimbra/"">Kimbra</a>'s vocals on ""The Night Believer"" have the eerie, almost inhuman perfection of a Eurovision competitor. The dazzling ""My Complications"" could be taken as Mew joining <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"" target=""_blank"">the War on Drugs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28880-lower-dens/"" target=""_blank"">Lower Dens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow"" target=""_blank"">Twin Shadow</a> in paying homage to Rod Stewart’s ""Young Turks"", though they bring in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"">Bloc Party</a>'s Russell Lissack to play <i>Top Gun</i> leads and create a more comprehensive time capsule.</p>
<p>The range allows +- to be Mew’s most consistently engaging record, even if it’s also the longest on both a cumulative and per-song basis. Unlike with <i>No More Stories...</i> and <i>Glass</i> <i>Handed Kites</i>, there’s no delineation between what they perceive as an interlude, exposition or proper song. You’re still guaranteed stretches where everything becomes a gorgeous mirage and Mew conveniently packages almost all of these lulls into the 11-minute ""Rows"". Still, in light of the theatrics and grand gestures that precede it, ""Rows"" feels like a necessary comedown before the closing prom theme ""Cross the River on Your Own"". It’s also perhaps the best proof of Mew’s aesthetic singularity: ""Cross the River"" accidentally and unmistakably evokes the chorus of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3CNhzSUbjs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">N.W.A.’s ""Automobile""</a> and still could be used by Baz Luhrmann to soundtrack a slow dance in the Sistine Chapel. So despite maintaining just about every quality that got them plugged as prog, <i>+-</i> argues for the reframing of Mew as a dream-pop act.</p></div>"|20288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20288--/|7.2|Ian Cohen

The group—Cooper Crain, Roberty Frye, and Dan Quinlivan—got all of the ingredients right. The record’s eight compositions were perfectly dialed in, both in terms of influences (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19024-laraaji-nadananda/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Laraaji</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a>) and the vintage gear and methods required to channel them (tape machines, loops, electric organs). It was like taking a stroll through a museum exhibit, a blissed-out reminder that, at this point, ambient music has a deep and well-established history.</p>
<p>Bitchin Bajas appeal is that they so expertly recreate a style of music designed for simple pleasure. This might make the trio sound like some sort of New Age cover band, but that’s not exactly the case. They don't create knock-offs or copies. Instead, they apply the same compositional methods and get results that are unique, but familiar. If you've spent some time with Terry Riley’s <i>A Rainbow in Curved Air</i>, Fripp and Eno’s <i>Evening Star</i>, or the Kuckkuck label catalog, Bitchin Bajas will register as more of a good thing. But on the group's latest EP, <i>Transporteur</i>, the trio has stepped back from their influences a little. The music is still meditative and trance inducing, but it’s harder to draw a direct line to an existing work or style.</p>
<p>Even though it’s labeled as an EP, at 34 minutes <i>Transporteur</i> is a sizeable chunk of music—four pieces that almost all stretch out to around nine minutes. The tracks are still based on repetitive looping phrases, but the instrumental palate has shifted, moving away from sounds that were wedded to yesterday's mystical moment (mainly, the electric organ) and relying more heavily on sequenced analog synthesizers.</p>
<p>The first two tracks, ""Rias Baixas"" and ""Planete T"", hew more closely to the Bitchin Bajas' established formula. A droney loop is introduced, then augmented with lush keyboard figures. It's great and thoroughly drifty stuff, if reminiscent of pastoral German synth noodlers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>.</p>
<p>The EP's second half moves into more distinctive territory. On ""No Tabac"", a percussive synthesizer sequence is paired up with flute doodles, which slowly evolve and accumulate urgency. Closer ""Marimba"" is particularly unusual. The process is basically the same—a burbling synthesizer loop evolves with the accumulation of additional instrumentation. Only here, the focus is on rhythm and percussion, rather than ethereal tones and pads, with seemingly random bongo-like sounds, hand claps, shakers, and additional percussive elements. At times, the music recalls Congolese electric thumb piano ensemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2384-konono-n1/"">Konono N°1</a>, albeit with a more overtly psychedelic bent. It’s excellent modern ambient music, exercising restraint, never crashing into a crescendo, and sustaining interest while remaining rooted in repetition.</p>
<p>In addition to a great record collection and a well curated studio, Bitchin Bajas have also internalized the concepts that made vintage ambient music engaging. Particularly, how tape loop-based or repetitive compositions can distort your perception of time, that they can supply a sense of stillness in motion, where seven minutes can slip by almost entirely unnoticed.</p></div>"|20476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20476-transporteur-ep/|7.7|Aaron Leitko

As leader of the <a href=""http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/46250/rough-cuts-five-years-ago-diamond-district-helped-define-the/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Diamond District</a> with rappers yU and Uptown XO, Odd is the mature figurehead: The group’s 2009 debut, <i>In the Ruff</i>, is a widely heralded classic in D.C.’s underground rap circles. In 2011, Oddisee released what’s probably his most lauded project to date, <i>Rock Creek Park</i>, a mostly instrumental album dedicated to his own bike rides through the sprawling D.C. landscape. By 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16782-odd-renditions-vol-001-ep/"">Odd Renditions</a></i>, you got a sense that he wanted greater visibility: He spit rhymes on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a> samples and flipped Marvin Gaye into a danceable rap tune.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Though in recent years, Oddisee’s tone has grown more acerbic. On his 2013 mixtape, </span><i>Tangible Dream</i><span>, Odd wagged the finger at fake friends and naysayers. He reserves some vitriol for </span><i>The Good Fight</i><span>, his sophomore album, though he sounds remarkably comfortable throughout its 12 tracks. He does more singing (""First Choice"", ""Meant It When I Said It"") and flirts with different time signatures (""Counter-Clockwise""). ""That’s Love"" recalls spacious funk, and on ""Fight Delays"", he brags a little more than usual: ""They tell me I ain’t buzzin’, well, last year I made well over a hunnid stacks."" That sort of straight-ahead statement is rare for Oddisee, who’s largely kept silent about his financial gains, though in 2010 he moved to Brooklyn from the D.C. area to further monetize his career.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The Good Fight</i><span> is technically a hip-hop record, but the vibe here is decidedly eclectic, building upon the kaleidoscopic method he’s employed for 13 years. If Odd’s </span><a href=""https://oddiseemmg.bandcamp.com/album/people-hear-what-they-see"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>debut album</span></a><span> addressed the uncertainty he felt about his artistic trek, </span><i>The Good Fight</i><span> proclaims the success of said path. He references a ""working"" plan that eschews mainstream attention and the fame that comes with it, choosing instead to be the low-key jetsetter culling inspiration from his global travels. As a result, </span><i>The Good Fight</i><span> exudes a sense of artistic freedom not heard on Oddisee’s previous releases. The music feels distinctly international and unhindered, far removed from the straight-ahead boom-bap he used to make. He’s always created on his own terms, but </span><i>The Good Fight </i><span>feels like a hearty ""fuck you"" to prevailing groupthink and the industry’s creative limitations. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, it’s clear Odd has grown tired of the false starts. On ""Want Something Done"", he complains about the phone meetings. He bemoans superficial demands and his own struggles to be heard. ""Glorifying music that’s abusive and a threat to us,"" Odd quips, ""and if you got a message in your records, you collecting dust."" That’s become a common theme for him, in particular, on 2012’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuqbx9CBy0o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Real""</a>, where the rapper contemplated his vision and the widespread anonymity felt by underground rappers. He revisits the notion on <i>Good Fight</i> standout ""What They’ll Say"", but the message quickly floats by: ""I know that my intentions go unnoticed, a part of me wants attention."" That’s long been Oddisee’s dilemma: On the surface, you’d think he doesn’t care about making it, yet there’s a part of him that values mainstream acceptance. <i>The Good Fight</i> is a streamlined reminder to ignore the restraints. Great music is great music, no matter where it comes from.</p></div>"|20397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20397-the-good-fight/|7.3|Marcus J. Moore

On the opener, ""Seven Thirty"", Home Blitz frontman Daniel DiMaggio erratically sucks air in before he pushes any out. Those spasms anticipate the album’s pace: <i>Foremost &amp; Fair</i> is a spritely, frantic power-pop record, and when it does lose momentum, it’s an act of willful, jarring derailment. Which is fantastic, since DiMaggio knows the mechanisms of a song intimately enough to enact swift sabotage and leave a gorgeous wreck.</p>
<p>While other recent power-pop records have owed a debt to tuneful punks like the Buzzcocks, Home Blitz is more evocative of power-pop’s nonstarters: the now-marketable misfortunes of Big Star and Rockin' Horse and the skinny-tie flops who disappointed label execs in the wake of ""My Sharona"". It’s a good time to be into that stuff. Labels like <a href=""http://www.singsingrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sing Sing Records</a> have redeemed scores of bands once snubbed by market forces or their own immutable peculiarities. <i>Foremost &amp; Fair</i> brings the latter camp to mind, except Home Blitz sounds simply committed to its left-field flourishes. Sure, nowadays the genre has relatively little commercial potential to squander, but DiMaggio flaunts his oblique streak like a point of pride, or protest. It’s what compels repeated listening.</p>
<p>To begin, there’s his voice: Breathy like Brett Smiley or Milk ‘n Cookies’ Ian North, unapologetically affected like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32416-game-theory/"">Game Theory</a>’s late Scott Miller, and often a bit pitchy. DiMaggio spikes saccharine melodies with bratty little gestures, rebelling against his own compositional knowhow. Also, the vocals rest decidedly on top of a mix that’s saturated with shimmery tones: teeming harpsichord, zippy keyboard, sunburst acoustic guitar picking. There’s little low-end to temper all of that, which amounts to an almost unrelentingly bright listen and underscores the album’s insistent urgency. The very first line goes, ""Seven-thirty headed towards seven forty-five."" The 37-minute record scrambles to fit into that 15-minute window.</p>
<p><i>Foremost &amp; Fair</i>’s A side is a salvo of impeccable songs. ""I'm That Key"", sequenced second, surges with radiant vocal hooks, careens through a solo, and stumbles into a busted outro. On ""The Tide"", DiMaggio cheekily narrates romance and seaside whimsy, while ""A in E"" is reminiscent of approximately eight swaggering Big Star tracks. ""Downtown"" is the album’s punchiest song, where a clipped riff trades jabs with the trap kit before it collapses into an arrhythmic bridge and then regains velocity.</p>
<p>The longest song, at almost five minutes, is ""The Hall"", where chintzy snare and clinking metal keep a glacial pace as sharp keys and guitar ring out beneath DiMaggio’s bleating. It’s an audacious centerpiece, like grandiose glam balladry running a glitter deficit, and a signal that DiMaggio isn’t content to dish sugary ditties, which ""Why It Cries"" almost immediately reinforces—without the same listening pleasure.</p>
<p>""Why It Cries"" is longer than ""The Hall"", but it can’t exactly be called a song. For over five minutes, it sounds like someone is looking for something in a cluttered music studio, appended by an impromptu Celtic jam. Since DiMaggio’s songs tend to implode in one way or another, ""Why It Cries"" seems like the autodestruct function planted at the core of <i>Foremost &amp; Fair</i> as a whole. Or maybe it’s an elaborate set-up for a cruel joke: Slog through the tedium and meet ""Sick and Crazy"", an exultant song that’s punishingly short at a mere 44 seconds.</p>
<p>DiMaggio, who has helmed Home Blitz for about 10 years, has issued scores of format, label, and genre-ambivalent recordings. Considering all of that, the initial panting on ""Seven Thirty"" is less like anticipation of the upcoming sprint and more like reeling from an earlier marathon. In hindsight, that bit of sputtering will also emerge as a clarion call for the whole of <i>Foremost &amp; Fair</i>: DiMaggio foregrounds eccentricities, which only outlines the strength of his conventional songwriting in relief.</p></div>"|20504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20504-foremost-fair/|7.6|Sam Lefebvre

When her voice enters, the atmosphere changes. She can make almost anything sound remarkable, or at least interesting, and her sharp, incisive rock songs shimmer with a ripe theatricality every time she opens her mouth.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Each song on <i>Fast Food,</i> her second LP, feels offered up and expertly framed, a series of rock songs given the lighting and treatment of museum objects. There is nothing particularly surprising or unsual going on in the makeup or her composition, which combine acoustic guitars with reverb’ed electric, a pretty time-honored and standard backing. But the band, which is excellent and intuitive, feel mostly in place to set the stage for Shah, who stands at the footlights on <i>Fast Food</i> and creates a powerful sense of intimacy and vulnerability. The best songs here zero in on a single evocative moment and spellbind you with it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">She has been compared, often, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a> (""That damn Nick Cave"" even gets a wry-sounding shout-out from Shah on ""Fool"") and while you can’t exactly hear <i>Rid of Me</i> or <i>The Boatman’s Call</i> resounding in <i>Fast Food</i>, she shares a certain sea-swept melancholy and a preoccupation with power. On ""Matador"" she moans about hooded eyes and nightfall over spaghetti-western guitars, which swell into a slightly cartoony blood-moon peak. ""I heard you were a man who does not cry,"" she sings with an audibly curled lip on ""Washed Up"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Maybe because her voice is already so distinct, and such a larger-than-life character, the songs that dial back to smaller moments tend to hit the hardest. They feel the most humane, and the most affecting. She can sing with tremendous tenderness, and ""Divided"" is a terrific love song, full of specific feeling. ""I let my hair loose for you, but I would scrape it back as soon as I would leave,"" she sings huskily. Something about the catches and crags in her delivery, her halting phrasing, carries the weight of real conversation, something between lovers over morning coffee.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-608d5911-0c07-6754-7260-6198f99ec7a6""><span>She told </span><a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2015/03/nadine-shah-big-hands/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rookie</i></a><span> that the song ""Stealing Cars"" is about her struggles with panic attacks, and how irrational thoughts manifest themselves in her dreams. The song moves at a leisurely pace, while her vocal traces a drowsy arc around three or four notes. It doesn’t feel like anxiety, but it invites you close anyhow, using an admission of struggle as a sort of invitation into an inner circle. It’s gorgeous, especially when the harmonies sail in and flesh out the main melody with a downward tug of yearning. There isn’t much going on in the lyrics, just a few images about finding solace in the arms of another; Shah’s best work hangs on simple gestures. ""And there was nothing else to do but fall in love with you""—those are the only words to the five-minute, two-chord ""Nothing Else to Do"". It’s a gorgeous, fairly time-stopping song, a moment that doesn’t need any elaboration to transfix you. It just needs the sentiment, the bare accompaniment, and Shah. </span></span></p></div>"|20452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20452-fast-food/|6.7|Jayson Greene

On ""Big Decisions"", James pushes back on the weight of a lopsided relationship, and the mundane, everyday struggle is charged with everything that has made My Morning Jacket one of the most likeable major American rock bands of the 21st century—reverberating Flying V guitars, James’ expansive rebel yell, explosive harmonies and reverb capable of canvassing the entirety of Manchester, Tenn. and beyond. Even if James is reasserting himself in an atypically selfish way, it sounds like a triumph big enough for everyone to share.</p>
<p>Since My Morning Jacket<b> </b>abandoned the grain silo on their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16943-z/"">2005 masterwork</a>, their albums have followed a similar format: reverb or no reverb, James’ saintly voice can redeem <i>anything, </i>so no song idea was too strange as long as it could still work at Bonnaroo. On that level, <i>The Waterfall</i> does little you haven’t already heard from My Morning Jacket; they just regain the quality control that abandoned them on <i>Evil Urges </i>and ditch the damage control that pervaded <i>Circuital.</i> ""Believe (Nobody Knows)"" feels precision-engineered for the express purpose of opening My Morning Jacket's live show for the next two years: a big, windmilled chord anticipates every low-register repetition of the title in the prechorus,<b> </b>preparing for when James lets the final ""BELIIIIIIIIIEVE"" rip an octave higher. And that’s where the Klieg lights inevitably hit, as does the same recognizable liftoff from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OMpaFvTOFk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wordless Chorus""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdSiIVwyhz4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mahgeetah""</a>, a feeling that the possibilities of life itself are limitless, not just the range of My Morning Jacket. You can’t fake something like ""Believe (Nobody Knows)"" if you haven’t played in front of tens of thousands of festival goers.</p>
<p>Then again, few found fault with the first ten minutes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11585-evil-urges/"" target=""_blank""><i>Evil Urges</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15471-circuital/"" target=""_blank""><i>Circuital</i></a>; the measure of a My Morning Jacket album is their success at doing what’s <i>not</i> expected of them. Compared to ""Highly Suspicious"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43399-watch-the-new-my-morning-jacket-video/"" target=""_blank"">""Holdin’ on to Black Metal""</a>, the risks here are more manageable, the results far more successful: there’s ""Compound Fracture"", which tails off into a coda of keyboard flutter and falsetto after flaunting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches"" target=""_blank"">Chvrches</a> electronic stomp and <i>Some Girls</i> strut. <span>""Get the Point"" delivers</span><span> James’ most biting lyrics to date within </span><span>a McCartney-esque acoustic ditty (""I'm trying to tell you plainly how I'm feeling day to day/ And I'm so sorry now that you ain't feeling the same way"").</span> The electronic cut-and-paste of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59045-my-morning-jacket-share-spring-among-the-living/"" target=""_blank"">""Spring (Among the Living)""</a> is a sleek, modernist iPad compared to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyTquuJi6lA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cobra""</a>’s bulky, retro ENIAC, while Eastern modes poking through ""Like a River"" and ""Tropics (Erase Traces)"" scent the chillout tent with lavender incense rather than the usual weed smoke. It reaffirms that MMJ are one of the most exciting American rock bands going when they’re at their most generous, curious and restless, as they are here.</p>
<p>But ""Big Decisions"" puts the focus squarely on a new place for an MMJ record: the lyrics. The song, and the album as a whole, gives Jim James The Person center stage for what feels like the first time, instead of just The Voice of Jim James. <span>As on record, James has been open with the big picture while skimping on the details</span><span>—</span>after 15 or so years of giving his all on stage, he’s left just as much off it, and here he is at 37, <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/one-big-circle-how-my-morning-jacket-rebounded-with-its-best-album-in-a-decade/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nearly crippled by workplace injuries</a>, spent from partying and wondering aloud in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/remaking-my-morning-jacket-behind-dark-new-the-waterfall-20150423"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""what have I done wrong in every relationship I've been in until now?""</a></p>
<p>There are legitimate personal stakes here and <i>The Waterfall</i> allows for James to express some uncharacteristic negativity without dwelling on it. For a record of spiritual and romantic reckoning, it’s remarkably level-headed and pragmatic. James sweetly coos over Chi-Lites psych-soul, ""It’s a thin line/ Between love and wasting my time"", clearly assessing a broken situation to which he mends on ""Get the Point"": ""Daydreaming of leaving/ I only had to do it."" He wishes his ex the best of luck and then immediately celebrates the exhilarating, frightening rush of single living on ""Spring (Among the Living)""—during each rambling guitar solo, you can picture James right-swiping to his heart’s content.</p>
<p>For many, Jim James is basically synonymous with My Morning Jacket, so it’s justifiable to find parallels in the rejuvenation of each—My Morning Jacket has another album on the way <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/jim-james-my-morning-jackets-two-new-albums-20141203"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some time next year</a>. It’s welcome news for the band's fans, but maybe a bit disappointing considering how a predetermined release schedule usually results in two <i>very good</i> albums in place of one great one, and <i>The Waterfall</i> gets close to greatness. With a little troubleshooting, it might have matched <i>At Dawn</i>'s cohesion or <i>Z's </i>dazzling diversity: The misty-eyed reflection of ""Only Memories Remain"" cycles back to a breakup narrative on Side B that otherwise feels like it was put on shuffle, and <i>The Waterfall</i> stalls the most during the usually incendiary guitar workouts. But this is Jim James accepting where he and My Morning Jacket are at the moment: a bit older, a bit broken, more skeptical but very much among the living.</p></div>"|20396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20396-the-waterfall/|7.9|Ian Cohen

Pictures, text messages, mementos, sure, but the hardest things to hold onto are the fleeting sensations: the taste of a person’s mouth, the feeling of first standing naked in front of them, the dent in the pillow where a lover’s head once laid. Braids’ third album <i>Deep in the Iris </i>plays as a record of all these tiny memories, accrued in the aftermath of losing someone. The record is rich with startling little images: Stories of being pushed down the stairs, being confronted as a child for mistakes made, wanting to crack the eggs of a group of hatching pigeons flicker across the album’s lyrics. They dance above the quicksilver music, vivid and unreal, and illustrate that sometimes the clearest thing you can remember from a long-forgotten moment is the way the sun felt on your skin.</p>

Whereas in the past the Montreal-based trio’s sound has been similar to their electronic contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"">Purity Ring</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz"">Majical Cloudz</a>, here the band ditches anything stark and futuristic. Instead, they opt for fleet, skittering jazz percussion, crackling beats and stuttering cuts in vocals, while delicate, classical piano runs beneath the electronic instrumentals. The glitchy, warped surface is offset by the clarity and versatility of Standell-Preston’s narrative vocals, which pull everything into focus. </p>
<p>On ""Taste"", singer Raphaelle Standell-Preston describes how the taste and feeling of someone you love never really leaves you, even when they treated you abusively to begin with (""We experience the love that we think that we deserve/ And I guess I thought I didn't need much from this world,"" she muses). And sometimes the band examines that isolation in a larger, societal context. ""It’s not like I’m feeling much different than a woman my age years ago,"" Standell-Preston begins on ""Miniskirt"", a song about rape culture and the cutting feeling of being objectified by men.  On ""Sore Eyes"" the synths rise, hinting at an actual dance track, before they fall back to the throbbing repetition of the song's bassline. The movement echoes the push and pull of the song’s message, as Standell-Preston breathily relays her dual desire and disgust in a song about watching porn on the Internet. <i>Deep in the Iris</i> never lets you get quite too familiar, or comfortable.</p>
<p>In the album’s track ""Bunny Rose"", Standell-Preston contemplates getting a dog to ail her loneliness, one which will always be waiting for her to come home. And it’s this sort of heartbreakingly simple desire, wanting to be unconditionally embraced by another when you come home, that pulls this album's<i> </i>messages about broken relationships to a universal plane. And while all those intensely specific sensations of an ended relationship do not get clearer with time, on <i>Deep in the Iris</i> it’s clear they are nevertheless always somewhere within you.</p></div>"|20503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20503-deep-in-the-iris/|7.4|Hazel Cills

Instead, they detail painful, violent ends inflicted by nature’s four forces—fire, earth, water, and wind—that the dead are forced to endure for eternity. There’s a suffocation, where the victim breaks teeth to keep breathing, and an immolation, where the narrator becomes ""the blooming ash."" One ghost falls into an endless canyon forever, while another buried at sea swims in salt water and skin. A case-by-case survey of horrible ways to go, <i>Four Phantoms</i> is appropriately and hyperbolically morose for the subgenre known as ""funeral doom."" But Bell Witch answers the extreme, existential despondency of these motifs with absolutely triumphant songs, built with heroic riffs and headstrong rhythms. <i>Four Phantoms</i>, then, is like second-line funeral doom—<i>very </i>heavy metal that celebrates life by staring straight at death.</p>
<p><span>Though Bell Witch were good from the start of their 2012 debut </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17450-longing/""><i>Longing</i></a><span>, </span>bassist Dylan Desmond and drummer Adrian Guerra are great on <i>Four Phantoms </i>because they’ve recognized and addressed their own faults. <i>Longing</i>, a six-song set that also examined mortality, was promising but unfocused, moving between lethargic 20-minute slogs and mid-tempo marches, horror-sample instrumentals and tone-obsessed drifts. Desmond plays a six-string bass, meaning he’s able to elicit piercing, guitar-like leads and subdural lines from one instrument. On <i>Longing</i>, the capability felt like a compositional toy he was still learning to wield.</p>
<p>But the pair refined their approach for <i>Four Phantoms</i>, eliminating extraneous elements and moving fluidly between what remains. <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Billy_Anderson/34428"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Recorded by resurgent metal impresario Billy Anderson</a>, this hour is sharper, louder and brighter than the last one. Too often with doom or stoner metal, the mantra ""everything louder than everything else"" leads to self-defeat, where members crowd each other out of the mix and reduce the music’s overall impact. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18418-windhand-soma/"" target=""_blank"">See, for instance, Windhand’s <i>Soma</i>.</a>) Due in part to the band’s slim configuration, <i>Four Phantoms</i> feels sculpted, each part perfectly visible and framed.</p>
<p>The result is a high-tension, high-contrast mix of ideas and idioms, where brutal doom and filmic post-rock share space with melodies worthy of glam-rock and manipulated textures similar to experimental acts like Locrian. These four pieces collectively suggest that metal is an incremental form: Substantial differences in how something sounds and in what niche it lands stem from subtle decisions about how fast, long or loud certain parts are played. Bits of opener ""Suffocation, A Burial"" sound like thrash metal drugged to stoner speed. ""Judgment, in Fire"" suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a> exploring liturgical music and adding a percussive pulse.</p>
<p>This hybridized scheme gives Bell Witch an uncanny appreciation of momentum. The type of low-and-slow music Bell Witch makes often requires a real commitment from the listener, a certain patience with songs that creep through half-hour spans to reach their high-volume peaks. But even during the pair of <i>Four Phantoms </i>numbers that break the 22-minute mark, Bell Witch don’t stall. Sure, they lock into loud, sustained roars, as with the start of ""Judgment: In Air"", and lurk in muted valleys, as when Desmond takes a glacially paced bass solo during ""Suffocation, A Burial"". But they emerge from that last reverie with a  jolt so loud it’s terrifying, especially if you’ve fallen for the bass’s soporific sway. As the song marches toward its end, Guerra doubles and triples his steady beat, and Desmond plays a melody so radiant it seems like an isolated Van Halen lead. Like the album itself, the moment aims for (and often achieves) symphonic grandeur, both in scope and sound.</p>
<p>Bell Witch's commitment to progress is most obvious on ""Suffocation, A Drowning"", the longest song of their career and their best use of a guest musician to date. Both Guerra and Desmond sing, but their ranges are typically limited to ghoulish incantations, monstrous growls and terrified screams. So they recruited a real vocalist—Erik Moggridge, who sings solo and plays acoustic guitar as <a href=""http://www.aerialruin.com/bio.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aerial Ruin</a>—to create what’s essentially a long-form power ballad. It arches and lifts, arriving at a hook so intoxicating you can envision lighters being raised. As Moggridge croons about ""the strangling beast"" of the ocean around him, Bell Witch turns funeral doom and its moribund focus into a beautiful hymn meant for the living.</p></div>"|20352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20352-four-phantoms/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

Last year the 21-year-old acknowledged to the <i><a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-towkio-20141218-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chicago Tribune</a></i> that following the respective successes of fellow SaveMoney members and childhood friends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32308-vic-mensa/"">Vic Mensa</a>, there are high expectations for him on his first full-length release. He addresses them directly on <i>.Wav Theory'</i>s Chance-featuring second track ""Clean Up"": ""I get it get it, your friends did it, they famous/ And you rap, too, so when you gon' make it?"" On his debut, he attempts to find a voice that is distinctly his own, to varying results.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Towkio's best trait is his ability to craft an effective pop track. He can flow nimbly, but the content of his lyrics often veers toward saccharine, rendering him more vocalist than rapper. ""I Know You"", for example, is a simple love song, but FKJ's smooth production and Towkio's catchy sample-aided chorus make up for less creative lines (""And I could take you there/ Like two shoes, girl, we make a pair""). On ""Free Your Mind"", Towkio rides a house beat, offering some basic uplifting words (""I can free your <i>miiiiind</i>!"") alongside Donnie Trumpet's horn playing and breaking into short, catchy clips in the third verse. He knows how to keep the listener's attention, even if he has not yet figured out how best to provide substantial lyrical depth. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Towkio's attempts at wisdom tend to read as buzzwords or markers for profundity, rather than anything meaningful. The title track that opens the album features dial-up sounds and waves crashing, as well as the various connections among ""The brain, [which] controls the heart/ The mind, [which] controls the brain/ The sun, [which] controls the moon/ [And] the moon, [which] controls the waves."" Although admirably starry-eyed, the concept is generally lost on an album largely consisting of poppy, dancey love songs. Towkio finds his way to some genuine emotions on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/"">Kaytranada</a>-produced ""Reflection"", the story of a cocaine-addicted woman he still loves. The song digs deeper because of its tight narrative, attention to detail, and grounding in reality, in addition to Kaytranada's melancholically danceable beat. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a pure bar-for-bar rapper, Towkio relies too heavily on backpack similes and punchlines to convey hackneyed ideas, as on ""Clean Up"": ""I give them monkey bars, them bitches hold weight/ The game like 'Madden' in '08, I swear it's fucked up."" On ""God in Me"", however, he compares himself playfully to an ""infant or a puppy,"" not something you would catch more self-conscious rappers doing. Unfortunately, he ends up losing the beat—a reminder that he is anything but a finished product.</p>
<p>The Social Experiment's Peter Cottontale serves as the mixtape's executive producer, alongside Towkio himself, and the Chicago quartet's sound is apparent throughout, with official credits on five of the 12 songs. The songs on the tape strike as either ""cool"" (""RN"", ""Reflection"", ""Break You Off"") or ""happy"" (""Clean Up"", ""Free Your Mind"", ""Heaven Only Knows""). Because Towkio deals in abstractions, there is little conflict or tension on the album, and the ideas with which he is grappling exist in the clouds. He admits as much on ""Break You Off"": ""What we have in common is the conscious/ So I speak on the subjective 'cause the rest is nonsense."" Towkio's nebulousness leaves <i>.Wav Theory</i> as an enjoyable album that asks few questions and gives few answers. </p></div>"|20536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20536-wav-theory/|6.2|Matthew Strauss

Dig even a little into this scene and you’ll quickly hit upon the name Loke Rahbek: a member of noise duo Damien Dubrovnik, synth-pop trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30758-lust-for-youth/"">Lust for Youth</a> and the neo-folkish local supergroup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30406-var/"">Vår</a>; a solo artist operating under pseudonyms like LR and Croatian Amor; and co-owner of <a href=""http://poshisolation.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Posh Isolation</a>, a small-press label and shop in Copenhagen’s Nørrebro district. Rahbek is everywhere and nowhere, the axis on which Copenhagen’s underground scene revolves.</p>
<p>Puce Mary, real name Frederikke Hoffmeier, debuted on Posh Isolation back in 2010 with <i>Piss Flowers</i>, a cassette of obscure industrial rumblings, and since then she and Rahbek have periodically worked as a duo, <i>The Female Form</i> being their third recorded collaboration. But 2010’s <i>Lucia</i> and the following year’s <i>The Closed Room</i> were made while both were barely out of their teens, and <i>The Female Form</i> feels like a bold step forward, showcasing not just the pair’s improved compositional prowess, but also the new spaces they have grown to inhabit.</p>
<p>Part recorded while the pair were composers in residence at EMS, a lavish state-funded studio in Stockholm equipped with vintage Serge and Buchla synthesizers, <i>The Female Form</i> lingers on the threshold between gritty basement industrial and the rarified field of electroacoustic composition. Everything here is crisp and in focus, and while there are no obvious beats, a fundamental sense of rhythm lies beneath everything. ""Swim"" and ""With Complete Will"" find the pair layering and binding circling loops into hard, grinding monoliths of sound, allowing them to gradually accrue mass, or disintegrate into clean tones and ultra-high frequencies that needle away at the edge of human perception. Both supply occasional vocals, which are stentorian and buried, occasionally making themselves intelligible amidst the clamor. On ""A Body Reimagined"", a throbbing generator drone gradually takes on an increasingly gnarly, growling texture as Rahbek issues abrupt commands: ""Arms bent/ Hips forced apart.""</p>
<p>Information accompanying <i>The Female Form</i> explains that it concerns ""intimacy and the (im)possible relation of the sexes."" Like much of Posh Isolation’s output, <i>The Female Form</i> has a complex relationship with industrial history. It operates loosely in the lineage, but dispenses with hoary old transgressive provocations—the misogyny, the ambiguous use of totalitarian imagery—in favor of more contemporary concerns: intimacy and communication, sexuality and gender identity. Which is not to suggest that the pair are uninterested in nudging at boundaries. Damien Dubrovnik shows have incorporated elements of Actionist performance art and Artaudian theatre, Rahbek finding exotic ways to debase himself—gagging himself with a microphone and plunging his head into a bucket of ice. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI3DTf6khnE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Impure Fantasy""</a>, the pair’s collaboration on Puce Mary’s 2014 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19606-puce-mary-persona/""><i>Persona</i></a>, pitch-shifted vocals to a gender-neutral place to explore fantasies of submission. There are echoes of that track on ""Liquefying of the Flesh"", Hoffmeier speaking coolly of ""punishments exchanged for favors"" as brief bursts of pink noise lash like a whip. Throughout, she shadows her monologue with panned and processed recordings of her own voice choking and crying out. In exertion, or exultation? It’s not quite clear, and the uncertainty is probably the point.</p>
<p>As accomplished as <i>The Female Form</i> is, it feels somewhat standoffish, leaving a lingering sense that its experiments in fantasy and intimacy come from a place which we, the listeners, are excluded. Perhaps in the future, Rahbek and Hoffmeier will find a way to make us feel like something more than voyeurs. Still, for a record that explores a proposed gulf between male and female experience, the participants feel very much of a kind—musically, philosophically, even visually. This impression adds a strange but inviting frisson to <i>The Female Form</i>. It's always encouraging when a record that raises more questions than it answers feels less like a tease, and more like the beginning of a conversation.</p></div>"|20537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20537-the-female-form/|7.5|Louis Pattison

Once the songs got underway, the band mostly just went through the motions, dutifully recreating the same arena-ready hooks and overblown saints-and-sinners metaphors they've been dealing in for decades. But for a few sweet seconds before the bombast began, there was just the zap and gurgle of Martin Gore's synthesizers.</p>
<p>For anyone who heard the distant promise of a far different, more interesting record in those moments, you're in luck: Gore's new solo album is an all-synthesizer affair. No guitars, no drums, no blues riffs, and, most important of all, no vocals—which means no tangled religious conceits, no BDSM analogies, no rhyming ""soul"" with ""control."" Gore has done solo records before—1989's <i>Counterfeit</i> EP and 2003's <i>Counterfeit 2</i>, both collections of synth-pop covers of songs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vini_Reilly"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vini Reilly</a>, et al—and he's done instrumental electronic music in his duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30096-vcmg/"">VCMG</a>, with his onetime bandmate Vince Clarke, later of Yazoo and now <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7319-erasure/"">Erasure</a>. But <i>MG</i> is something new. These are sketches rather than songs, and, unlike VCMG's visceral, sternum-punching, 10,000-watt techno throb, they're designed mostly to fade into the background.</p>
<p>Some tracks feature subtle beats, but for the most part this is ambient music the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> envisioned it, as a kind of sonic wallpaper. That's no slight: the record's low stakes help make evident what it excels at, which is sound design—a careful sculpting of electricity and air. It feels less like fine art than exceptional craftsmanship, but that's OK; the world needs beautifully thrown pots as much as it needs Picassos.</p>
<p><span>A few tracks here began life as demos for </span><i>Delta Machine</i>; <span>Gore finished </span><i>MG</i><span> in 2013, after the band finished touring</span><span>.</span> He recorded it in his home studio on, principally, a modular synthesizer system. Modular systems are something like the Legos of electronic music: Users build their own, custom synthesizers by patching together various devices into mazelike configurations, the functionality of which is often pretty fuzzy even to the person cabling them together. That unpredictability is important: it means that the process of wiring things together is largely inseparable from the process of composition. It is experimental in the most basic sense—<i>Let's see what happens when we plug this into this</i>—and that sense of curiosity is at the heart of <i>MG</i>. It sounds pretty much like what it is—someone alone in the studio at night, twisting knobs, feeling his way gingerly along the signal chain. In both its restraint and its moodiness, it turns inward, not outward. To listen to it feels a little like eavesdropping on someone else's thoughts.</p>
<p>Gore has described the album as ""kind of atmospheric and filmic,"" and he's right; it would be easy to imagine almost anything here working as a soundtrack cue. The average track length is around three minutes, just long enough for an idea to blossom and shrivel, like a flower in time-lapse. The gnarled arpeggios and general menace of tracks like ""Spiral"" and ""Stealth"" recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18443-nine-inch-nails-hesitation-marks/""><i>Hesitation Marks</i></a>, while elsewhere the album suggests a grittier, more minimalist answer to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' soundtrack to <i>The Social Network</i>. And it's impossible not to think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"">Vangelis</a> in the context of the album's most dramatic tracks. ""Crowly"", with its slow, stately melody, is a gleaming hovercraft of a tune, pretty clearly modeled after the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/""><i>Blade Runner </i>soundtrack</a>, and the closing track, ""Blade"", doesn't even try to hide its inspiration, as augmented chords dissolve into fizzy streamers.</p>
<p>For all the album's modest ambitions, it doesn't lack for variety. ""Pinking"", which opens the album, is the lone track to feature something <i>like</i> vocals, in the form of the gauzy choral pads familiar from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a>'s <i>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</i>. It's a wisp of a thing—just two-and-a-half minutes of harpsichord-like chimes and celestial sighs. It would be easy to imagine it as the basis of a Depeche Mode song, and who knows, it might have made a great one. But it's pretty much perfect as it is. Too much music is led astray by its creators' attempts to add more; the great beauty of <i>MG </i>is that at a certain point while he was plugging in cables and twisting knobs, Gore simply said, ""Enough,"" and it was.</p></div>"|20410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20410-mg/|7.2|Philip Sherburne

While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7862-bradford-cox/"">Bradford Cox</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a> have become indie rock A-listers with serious influence, they too had to start somewhere, and <i>Melbourne </i>may have actually been more accomplished than some of their earliest releases. But Scott’s follow-up, <i>Sunshine Redux</i>, doesn’t just defy or confound expectations—it fails to acknowledge their existence.</p>
<p>It’s tempting and unfair to speculate on what Jackson Scott <i>should’ve</i> done here; he doesn’t owe the listener anything besides his best effort. But Scott wouldn’t even be in this position were it not for four-track charmers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15436-jackson-scott-sandy/"">""Sandy""</a> or ""Evie"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15009-jackson-scott-that-awful-sound"">""That Awful Sound""</a>. Those songs had Scotchgard-huffing vocals, crackle and hiss, tape warping, but the sound effects weren't the source of their power: Scott’s strengths are in pop songwriting, not production. And <i>Sunshine Redux</i> does everything it can to bury his melodies, vocals, and lyrics in favor of… not much of anything, really.</p>
<p>Even more denatured and opaque than the soupy <i>Melbourne</i>, <i>Sunshine Redux</i> is self-produced to a gooey, garish, gritty and barely mobile gel—the sound of gum refusing to leave the bottom of your shoe. Considering the tools available to even the most novice and/or cash-strapped home recorder, one has to hear all of this as a protracted aesthetic choice rather than a result of economic necessity. And so the question throughout is, simply, <i>why</i>? Why does Scott subject his vocals to so many forms of disorientation when his indecisive melodies barely sound like they’re aware of their surroundings to begin with?</p>
<p>Peering into the lyrics only reinforces the confusion. As with the music, the words are vaguely surreal, inscrutable but one-dimensional. Coming from an acolyte of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"">Syd Barrett</a>, a song called ""Merry Nightmare"" hits squarely on the nose. In the preceding song, he revisits the juxtaposition of whimsy and brutal violence from ""Sandy"", but the utter blankness of ""Save the World"" makes its Dr. Seuss-quoting chorus (""Oh the places that you’ll go/ When you’re far too young to know"") come off like a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys3A_SMt1WY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Korn-y gimmick</a>.</p>
<p>Had <i>Sunshine Redux </i>preceded <i>Melbourne, </i>perhaps it could be heard as the work of an immature artist trying to develop a feel for songwriting voice and production. Or, like the hundreds of passable records of crudely recorded psych-pop to which it’s comparable, perhaps it wouldn’t be heard at all. But Scott seemed like he was already beyond that. There’s one lyric from ""PRPLMTV"" that could be read as introspective<span>—but ""</span>when you went to college to blossom in folly/ You took lots of molly,"" is Scott making a nonchalant cop to being a dude who isn’t much interested in meeting expectations. <i>Melbourne</i> wanted us to believe that Jackson Scott was subverting pop.

Both have histories in groups (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"">Royal Trux</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4665-wooden-wand-and-the-vanishing-voice/"">Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice</a>, respectively) who began as sprawling avant-rock outfits, then gradually incorporated traditional influences— blues, country, classic rock—without losing their eccentric edges. Their solo careers have followed similar paths, glancing at the past while breaking open the future. Even Hagerty and Toth’s singing voices—a mix of nasally twang and slacker drawl—are similar. The prospect of a collaboration seems redundant, likely to sound like just another record in their vast discographies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It takes </span><span><i>Qalgebra</i> </span><span>about 10 seconds to blow those worries away. The coiled riffs and crackling beat of tightly-wound opener ""Spindizzy"" sound more like vintage </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2725-meat-puppets/""><span>Meat Puppets</span></a><span> than anything Hagerty or Toth has done before. The song’s taut energy doesn’t last for all of </span><i>Qalgebra</i><span>, half of which is occupied by a single 18-minute title track filled with ebbs and flows. And the overall sound isn’t a radical departure for either artist; you’ll easily recognize their voices, riffs, and sly senses of humor.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But for the majority of </span><i>Qalgebra</i><span><i>’</i>s five songs, Hagerty and Toth (alongisde bassist Darin Gray and drummer Eric Van Leuven) find a level of urgency and sharpness distinct from their previous efforts. It's as if they were only able to play for a weekend and had to make the most of every moment. Nothing sounds rushed, but everything moves forward at a steady, enthralling clip. The pair feed off each other naturally, their adventurous guitar playing bleeding across every moment while never obscuring basic, uncomplicated songs.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There’s also something funny and oddly joyful about </span><span><i>Qalgebra</i>.</span><span> Most of the tunes swing with a casual levity that at times approaches giddiness. The music’s playful atmosphere is made literal by Hagerty and Toth’s deadpan banter at the end of tracks, which sounds like an aging stoner’s version of mid-album rap skits. (Representative sample: ""What’s the best word?"" ""Biggie fries."" ""That’s two words."") Whatever the pair might have been smoking, it gives </span><i>Qalgebra </i><span>an endearing breeziness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That feeling is what makes the long, album-ending title track fitting, despite being a stylistic opposite to the rest of </span><i>Qalgebra</i><span>. At first glance its improv aura makes it seem like filler, an easy way to pad an EP out into an LP. But a few listens reveal logic in the sonic rambling, much the way </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/""><span>Yo La Tengo</span></a><span>’s extended jams are like stretched-out echoes of tighter tunes. The expansion comes as a bit of a relief after four much snappier songs, but what matters most is how psyched everyone sounds about playing with each other. Both Hagerty and Toth have traversed dark places in their work, but </span><i>Qalgebra </i><span>is unabashedly happy, and all the better for it.</span></p></div>"|20507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20507-qalgebra/|7.0|Marc Masters

In 1977, as Levan was opening the Paradise Garage in the gritty heart of Hudson Square, Baldelli was brought in as the resident DJ at posh discotheque Baia Degli Angeli, looking out onto the Adriatic Sea. As Levan drew on countless genres to craft what would become the ""Garage"" sound (disco, new wave, synth reggae), Baldelli took eclectic records ranging from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> to Eurodisco cheese to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"">Fela Kuti</a>, sometimes layering three to four records to craft a sound soon dubbed ""Afro/Cosmic"" when he moved over to the Italian club Cosmic in 1979. Defined by synths that aim towards outer space and hard percussion influenced by thundering tribal drums, Baldelli’s mesmeric, head-widening sound and<a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2014/09/18/daniele-baldelli-50-favourite-cosmic-records/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> eclectic selections </a>have influenced numerous generations of DJs and producers, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29721-dj-harvey/"">DJ Harvey</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje"">Todd Terje</a>.</p>
<p>But while Levan descended into drugs and died at a tragically young age, Baldelli—now in his sixties—has had a renaissance of sorts. He’s remixed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31802-museum-of-love/"">Museum of Love</a> as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2963-roisin-murphy/"">Róisín Murphy</a> and recently turned in a marathon set in Coachella, Ca. After numerous mix CDs, edits made in conjunction with younger Italian artists like Marco Dionigi and Luca Roccatagliati, this month sees the legend release <i>Cosmic Drag</i>. With its title and four other song titles bearing the word ""cosmic"" (two more reference space) you can already anticipate what Baldelli has in store here.</p>
<p>Even if there isn't a new sound to be discovered across these dozen tracks, <i>Cosmic Drag</i> exceeds expectations, with almost every track bearing a shooting-star thrill. And as one would expect from an iconic DJ known to unearth rare tracks, Baldelli excels in sussing out the sweet spot between genres and exploring the new space between. So while ""Ballbearing"" opens with electro pings and a metallic chug, midway through a vintage synth melody emerges and gives the track buoyancy and lift. The rubber band bass of ""Space Dumper"" suggests where '70s funk meets German kosmische, with a psychedelic guitar lick made to sound like rippling water on top.</p>
<p>There’s a sameness to some of Baldelli’s productions here, to where I’d have a difficult time telling you which track is ""Cosmic Particles"" and which is ""Cosmic Glide"", much less which one is ""Cosmic Drag"". But there are standouts: the upbeat disco-funk of ""Mooneyes"" and the heavy Afro drums that roil across grandiose melody and Speak-&amp;-Spell vocals of ""Chop and Roll"" are worthy of entry into the Afro/Cosmic canon. If he hadn’t rendered them himself, no doubt Baldelli would want to weave them into his set.</p></div>"|20521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20521-cosmic-drag/|7.0|Andy Beta

The Brewis brothers engineered and played on <i>Ripe</i>, which was recorded at their small studio on the banks of the River Tyne and bears all the hallmarks of their flinching funk deconstructions. That connection is the obvious reason to listen to Slug’s debut, which works as a fine stopgap while Field Music work on the followup to 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16278-field-music-plumb/""><i>Plumb</i></a>. But Black is more than just a caretaker, indulging the prog specter that only haunts the edge of the Brewises’ compositions.</p>
<p>Black dots his nervy songs with imperious choruses that owe a debt to Queen and Greek tragedy, and there are two lengthy instrumental interludes here: ""Weight of Violence"" is a muted steel drum dream that acts as a palate-cleanser, but ""Peng Peng"", a baroque piano suite that breaks into a yowling guitar solo, is a bit ostentatious in context. The best of <i>Ripe</i> maintains an invigorating tension between this introversion and theatricality: the pointillist percussion and surf guitar of ""Sha La La""; the sleazy funk guitar that romps through ""Cockeyed Rabbit Wrapped in Plastic"", as Black adopts a passionless falsetto to indict the untouchable elite. On ""Greasy Mind"", he slithers between tightly coiled guitar parts, while ""At Least"" pairs a barbershop chorus with a searching, forlorn synth part that recalls <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqZ8428GSrI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Specials’ </a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqZ8428GSrI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost Town""</a>.</p>
<p>Slug’s debut took four years to make, but it feels right that it’s finally out a month shy of the British General Election—in his calm courtroom tone, Black spends much of <i>Ripe</i> criticizing electioneering and the deliberate narrowing of message for political gain. He sings in a combative, sly tone, condemning a single, repellent ""you"": the powerful character preserving the status quo to save his own neck on ""Eggs and Eyes"", the right-wing figures claiming to be the voice of the working class on ""At Least"". Whoever it was written about, it’s impossible to hear that song’s ""creepy crawly fatigue of your mouth/ That does sup beer and shout"" without thinking of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Farage</a>, the leader of the rising but hapless right-wing UKIP party, who is rarely pictured without <a href=""http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02568/farage_2568981b.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a pint and his Cheshire Cat grin</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to the saying that good music thrives in bad times, the tenure of the right-leaning Conservative Party (in coalition with the left-wing Liberal Democrats) hasn’t provoked a particularly visible upsurge in politicized British music. But if the idea of hard times as a creative impulse was ever going to hold up, it’s in the North East, the area hit often hardest by government cuts. There’s little choice but to be self-sufficient 300 miles from London, a model that Field Music have pioneered. For all its minor stylistic differences, <i>Ripe</i> is very much forged in their image. But if any traditions in British indie rock are worth perpetuating right now, this inventive, engaged stable is the one to back.</p></div>"|20469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20469-ripe/|6.9|Laura Snapes

Protagonist Guy Montag comes home from work to find his wife limp and dying of an overdose on sleeping pills. Montag calls for assistance and hangs back helplessly as paramedics revive her, thinking to himself, ""There are too many of us. There are billions of us and that’s too many. Nobody knows anyone."" Could Bradbury have foreseen the quiet anomie of faces bathed in smartphone light, shuttling through overcrowded cities, alone together in only tangential acknowledgement of one other’s humanity? Perhaps. Perhaps not.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Singer-songwriter Damon Albarn invokes Bradbury’s sentiment on ""There Are Too Many of Us"", the emotional centerpiece of </span><i>The Magic Whip</i><span>, the reunion album from his reconstituted flagship Blur, as he muses about an </span><a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6509426/blurs-new-song-inspired-by-sydney-siege"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Australian hostage crisis</span></a><span> he once spectated on television from a hotel room above it. ""For a moment I was dislocated by terror on the loop elsewhere,"" he admits in verse two<span>—</span>not horrified, just momentarily ""dislocated""<span>—</span>as if to call into question our dwindling concern for people in places outside our cubicles of convenience. Technology has made our world smaller, but it hasn’t made us less isolated. Ease of access doesn’t equal closeness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The Magic Whip </i><span>is the first Blur album since 2003’s </span><i>Think Tank</i><span>, the first with guitarist Graham Coxon onboard since 1999’s </span><i>13 </i><span>(Coxon was booted from the </span><i>Think Tank </i><span>sessions a week in and summarily quit), and the first with producer Stephen Street since 1997’s </span><i>Blur</i><span>. In 2013, a lucky twist of fate netted the group some downtime between festival dates in South China and Indonesia, and Blur holed up in a Hong Kong studio to workshop new material. Anyone who’s waited a decade and a half for Albarn and his songwriting foil to resume tussling over bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree’s lithe low end will find a lot to enjoy; something special happens when these four get in a room, and you can still hear some of it happening here. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The distant traveler’s conflicting sense of wonder and alienation is the running theme here. ""New World Towers"" gazes at the web of neon signs overhead in awe of their glow, ""Go Out"" details nights alone at the bar and defeated late-night self-love. On ""Thought I Was a Spaceman"" Albarn recasts a longing for the comforting familiarity of London as a space-wrecked astronaut’s homesickness. <i>The Magic Whip </i>was conceived as Albarn wrapped work on his 2014 solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19280-damon-albarn-everyday-robots/""><i>Everyday Robots</i></a>, and it’s tempting to see its disaffected tourism as a sister to <i>Robots</i>’ shattered workaday ennui back home.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sensibilities from Albarn’s extracurricular projects frequently bleed into the frame, especially the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/"">Gorillaz</a>, which shows both in dubby, beat-oriented cuts like ""New World Towers"" and in the lyrics’ pervasive sense of Englishness-in-exile. ""Thought I Was a Spaceman"" could easily serve as a prequel to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3526-demon-days/""><i>Demon Days</i></a>’ post-apocalyptic opener ""Last Living Souls"" in sound and story, and ""Ghost Ship"" wouldn’t look out of place anchored off the shores of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14008-plastic-beach/""><i>Plastic Beach</i></a>. At times the sonic tug-of-war feels like Albarn clawing at the restrictions of a framework his ideas have outgrown.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In the moments when <i>The Magic Whip </i>is most interested in sounding like a Blur album, it is perhaps <i>too </i>interested. There’s a nod to nearly every epoch, from the synth-accented <i>Parklife </i>alt-rockisms of ""I Broadcast"" to the busy <i>Great Escape </i>pop of ""Lonesome Street"", the <i>Blur</i>-ish guitar squall of ""Go Out"" and the winding <i>13</i>-influenced electro-psych of ""Spaceman"". <i>Whip</i> functions as a career travelogue in that sense; one wonders whether the decision to have Street, the band’s Britpop-era producer, helm the sessions hasn’t aroused a certain sense of nostalgia. Restless innovators deserve a cycle back through the worlds they’ve crafted here and there (see: the last decade worth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a>) but it’s disorienting for a band as keenly interested in artistic recombination as Blur.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sometimes the album veers into sleepy territory: The ambient washes and close mic’d, reverb-drenched strumming of ""Spaceman"" are welcome flourishes, as is the cluttered keyboard-and-acoustic bounce of ""Ice Cream Man"", but both are better showcases for production than song structure. There’s also sluggish, saccharine adult contemporary on ""My Terracotta Heart"" and closer ""Mirrorball"", though, momentum-killers in a back end that sometimes lags where it should lift. The tempo only picks up on ""Lonesome Street"", ""Go Out"", and ""I Broadcast""; the rest of the album bobs calmly adrift. It suits the album’s geographical fixation on Hong Kong, Indonesia, and especially the beaches and waters in between, but not the band’s own sweet spot.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All these frustrations fall away when the quartet locks into its signature jangly strut, as it does on the late album highlight ""Ong Ong"", a chugging rocker outfitted with a chorus of lilting la-la’s. Its sunny soul is infectious, as Albarn, who once lamented he had ""no distance left to run,"" professes a love no measure of forbidding space could quell. Coxon’s in the wings playing hokey luau guitar, zeroing in on Damon’s seafaring yearning and playing it up for yaks until he storms center stage as the song draws to a noisy close. Blur’s always been puckish in spirit, its greatest gift the identification and gleeful subversion of listener expectations, a<span>nd in moments like these it re-emerges, untarnished by the passage of time.</span></p></div>"|20539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20539-the-magic-whip/|7.0|Craig Jenkins

Guitarist and vocalist Nick Zammuto and cellist Paul de Jong seemed to appear from thin air with 2002's </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/854-thought-for-food/"">Thought for Food</a></i><span>, a startlingly innovative album that exuded a strange ease. The dark humor they squeezed from thrift-store VHS tapes and home videos in the decade to follow was both unnerving and sedative, recalling bouts of nostalgia just vague enough to belong to anyone, spliced deftly on the three albums that followed. After uploading a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47146-the-books-detail-retrospective-box-set/?""><span>12-minute video</span></a><span> detailing their farewell box set, </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17003-a-dot-in-time/"">A Dot In Time</a></i><span>, </span><span>they disbanded in 2012. Nick Zammuto quickly began his own endeavors under his last name. Paul de Jong, however, went into hiding.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After the exhaustion of </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14459-the-way-out/"">The Way Out</a></i><span>, de Jong uses <i>IF </i>to return refreshed and willing to reveal sides previously overshadowed</span><span>. The cello was merely an instrument in the Books’ work, for instance, but here it becomes its own character. He filters it through glitches on ""Debt Free"" and anxious whirring during ""Golden Gate"", but it truly comes into its own on ""Age of the Sea"". Moody chords resonate in an empty room, giving off a hollow tone before lo-fi field recordings from a beach enter. A seagull calls out as de Jong creates one of his most beautiful cello lines to date, leaning into the instrument and breathing life into what seems to be an uncovered personal memory sanded down by time.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">De Jong hasn't abandoned the duo’s trademark collage-pop absurdity, but he has refined it. Zammuto's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16433-zammuto/"">last</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19766-zammuto-anchor/"">two</a> albums, while farcical and energetic, had numerous throwaway tracks; <i>IF </i>is more calculated. At 51 years old, ten years Zammuto's elder, de Jong plays with his toys differently, and the tracks are always, no matter what, kept tidy. Slapstick number ""Snakes"" indulges in a man’s manic hallucinations of serpents for under a minute, as if de Jong seeks to prove he’s capable of matching Zammuto's colorful, campy energy.  Otherwise he evokes a grave solitude: a man standing in an open field, maybe, palms grazing over the tips of tall grass, muting his thoughts to let the sound of air fill his skull.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">De Jong dips into the shadows of jazz in album’s final moments, for the bleak solitude of ""Purpose"". Wind audibly brushes against the microphone as a piano traces some meandering chords, evoking a forlorn sense of resignation and acceptance. It is the sound of someone at the halfway point of their life, looking forward and backward. In that, it's a quiet return to 2003's <i>The Lemon of Pink.</i> <i>IF</i> is patient and spacious, suggesting that de Jong has found solitude, if not peace, between the strings of his cello.</p></div>"|20346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20346-if/|7.2|Nina Corcoran

Then he left Belle and Sebastian to concentrate on Looper, who made three albums and a few singles between 1998 and 2002 before going wherever it is that pleasant, unassuming little bands go.</p>
<p>And now we have this five-disc boxed set of Looper's (nearly) complete discography, including the new ""guess what, we're back"" album <i>Offgrid: Offline</i> (available separately only as a download). It's not straightforward reissues, though: all the tracks have been resequenced into thematic compilations with neologistic titles. One, which starts with their most-frequently-used-in-movies-and-such track ""Mondo '77"", is devoted to instrumentals and near-instrumentals. Another, which starts with one version of the how-Karn-and-Stuart-met story ""Impossible Things"" (and features another half an hour or so later), collects the tracks on which Stuart reads spoken-word pieces in a subdued voice over not-especially-intrusive musical beds—the sort of thing he'd done with Belle and Sebastian on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9psq4wzl98"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Century of Elvis""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ut7GhxcgSY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Space Boy Dream""</a>.</p>
<p>A third assembles the band's more straightforward pop songs, like 2002's ""Fucking Around"", an unnervingly violent cousin to ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"". Then there are two further catchall song-based discs. One of them claims to draw on hip-hop and R&amp;B-inspired ideas about beats (Looper always did like DJ-scratch sounds), and the other on a broader range of electronic music, but the distinctions aren't especially clear in practice. Both are also generally the Looper recordings that have aged most poorly, like a 1999 single called ""Who's Afraid of Y2K?"", in which Stuart's repeated murmur of ""maybe Y2K will bring the rain"" occasionally gives way to weary electro-burbles.</p>
<p>This seems like a very strange way to reframe the work of a band whose three previous albums can be found used online for a penny apiece. Looper have always been a mix-CD band—a track at a time can be a refreshing interlude in a collection of music by other people—and if their earlier records rarely stuck their heads up too high, at least they had a welcome variety of approaches. But sorting their music into stylistic piles exposes their weaknesses. Their best songs (""Uncle Ray"", ""Burning Flies"") have a bit of bitterness and swagger about them, but too many others are anemic sketches—they've got a nice keyboard tone, or a decent rhythm loop, and perhaps a little snippet of melody, and then they just shrug their shoulders and do their thing for a few minutes.</p>
<p>""It was mainly Best Ofs I liked when I was growing up,"" Stuart noted in a recent <a href=""http://www.philthymag.com/looper-boxsets-and-being-scottish-an-in-depth-chat-with-stuart-david/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Philthy Mag</a> interview. ""That was what really made me want to rearrange the tracks for the boxset. Into something like a collection of Best Of CDs."" That's not how best-ofs work—and, actually, a tight, smartly sequenced Looper greatest-hits album would be a likable addition to an indie-pop shelf. <i>These Things</i> clarifies the band's aesthetic, but it makes them harder to listen to.  </p></div>"|20497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20497-these-things/|5.8|Douglas Wolk

By 2009 he’d been signed and dropped by Columbia Records—an official debut got lost along the way—and then found his stride with a mixtape that might remain his best work to date. <i>Trunk Musik 0-60</i>, Interscope’s street album rehash of that mixtape, is the other contender. Yela had found a place—Interscope seemed to get him—and struck a chord.</p>
<p>When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16092-radioactive/""><i>Radioactive</i></a> rolled around in 2011 it felt like Yelawolf had broken a promise, or at least lost himself, in failed (and weird) crossover attempts. Unfortunately, and for different reasons, <i>Love Story</i> vies with that last album as the worst music of his career; as a result, it’s also getting harder to remember the gritty luster of his peak. Even worse, this new project seems to cement a damning new identity for Yela: once-compelling mixtape artist, shoddy album-maker.</p>
<p>With 18 tracks spanning more than 74 minutes, <i>Love Story</i> is far too long to accomplish so little and hits the same notes over and over again. It’s draining. Most glaring is Yelawolf’s devolution as a rapper: He’s developed a bad habit of leaning on cringey similes and seems to have forfeited the snappy, accelatory delivery that made <i>0-60</i> so fun to listen to and hard to rap along with. ""Still on that grass like John Deeres,"" he raps on ""Whiskey in a Bottle""; on ""Love Story"", he offers ""Got my weight up like I’m carrying fat people."" Here he is denouncing wannabe rednecks on ""Change"": ""Yellin' redneck, you about as red as the color blue is."" Those types of lines not only sound worse the second (and third) time around, they run rampant. On ""Disappear"" he feigns a cathartic letter to an estranged father—""You told me what you did, carpentry, right?""—and then at the end of the song a supposed-to-be-big reveal falls hopelessly flat: ""I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?""</p>
<p><i>Love Story</i> has moments that seem to aim at Americana. Sometimes that means thigh-slapping, rootsy country (""Have a Great Flight"") and sometimes it’s psychedelic southern rock. In either case, they cast Yela as a cheesy pastiche artist. ""Johnny Cash"" features the rapper narrating his arms-length relationship with a live audience and then for a hook he just says ""Johnny Cash"" like half-a-dozen times. At surface level at least, ""Best Friend"" is the album’s attention-grabber with the solitary feature in the form of an extended, rambling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a> verse. The appearance is the first we’ve heard from Em in 2015 and it’s a characteristically jumbled bit of technical braggadocio. At one point he strings together a series of bars that internally carry ""shiggy-shock"" and ""im-piggy-possible"" and ends with, ""word to the diggy doc/ Stiggy-stopping is not an option."" It’s like Eminem is breaking down a complicated piece of Ikea furniture and purposefully veering away from the instructions in putting it back together. Once it all fits, it’s hard to see what the point was.</p>
<p>As both an executive producer and label-head, <i>Love Story</i> signals a failure for Eminem as well, and bears the same structural flaws that nag his own late-career output—namely, a lot of filler, poor sequencing, and just too much of the same damn thing. Em’s fingerprints are all over the music and his own production credits yield plodding, heavy-handed beats that don’t suit Yelawolf’s once-erratic flow. The WillPower produced ""Till It’s Gone"", a single released last year that found a place during a plot climax on the FX show ""Sons of Anarchy"", feels like the best the album has to offer. Yelawolf doesn’t strain his singing here and settles into a marching flow over the looped-up acoustic guitar and heel-stomping bottom end. The hook is still full of platitudes and a not-so-productive tautology, but as a whole it’s better than everything else here.<span> ""Fiddle Me This"" caps off the album with a rote ""Devil Went Down to Georgia"" interpolation bleeding into a gratuitous scratching interlude, and </span><span class=""il"">Yelawolf</span><span> raps, ""Yeah, I've done come a long way."" Like the rest of the album though, there doesn't seem to be much to show for the journey, and </span><span class=""il"">Yelawolf</span><span> sounds like he's just going through the motions instead of actually covering ground.</span></p></div>"|20531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20531-love-story/|4.9|Jay Balfour

Mr. Steal Your Girl has never been in danger of falling off, but on his sixth album, he seemed to have more competition than ever as the dude-R&amp;B sphere over-brewed with stylized, specific points of view. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> had officially arrived, with ""Or Nah"" creeping up the Hot 100 and ""Paranoid"" still in radio rotation; Chris Brown was somehow bigger than ever, riding high off addictive-but-repugnant single ""Loyal""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a> had gotten his second wind, steadily becoming rap’s favorite guest vocalist, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31498-partynextdoor/"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>, and a league of imitators were occupying the moody lane left open as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> drifted away from R&amp;B.</p>
<p>As his less firmly established peers have dipped their toes into the ""alt-R&amp;B"" pool or flirted with EDM to stay relevant, Trey’s point of view has remained trendy but traditional, his generation’s best candidate for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly"">R. Kelly</a>’s torch-bearer; and while he’s subtly evolved over the years, gracefully embracing hip-hop and R&amp;B’s increasing cross-pollination, he hasn’t made too many pronounced stylistic shifts. He might lack the crossover appeal or critical darling status of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"">The-Dream</a> or the Weeknd, but his singles discography is unimpeachable—not to mention, he can sing any of the aforementioned under the table.</p>
<p><i>Trigga</i> emphatically reaffirmed Trey’s hit-making pedigree: The album spawned a whopping six singles, best among them <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a> collaboration <span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEmrvCiEapM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Touchin, Lovin""</a>.</span> Trey and production team The Featherstones dabbled in the surefire 2014 hit strategy, ""interpolate a '90s classic"" (in this case, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtLf2gZ8aZ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big and Kells’ ""Fuck You <span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_566082544""><span class=""aQJ"">Tonight""</span></span></a>), but made sure to slyly note, ""If we talkin’ bout sex, girl you know <span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zI3OeNsnvI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I invented that</a>""</span>—a reminder of his indelible stamp on millennial baby-making jams. But Trey’s alpha-male anthems have always had a bit of a chauvinistic edge, and ""Touchin, Lovin"" succeeded in no small part because it allotted space for a strong female perspective as a counterpoint to the bro-y narcissism of a guy used to having his way.</p>
<p>If you squint, Trey’s recent six-song <i>Intermission</i> EP, a stopgate to tide fans over until <i>Trigga: Reloaded</i> this summer, does what Trey does best: provide a no-skips-required sex playlist, or at least an escapist fantasy for zoning out at your desk. The satiny synths, leisurely finger-snap percussion, and evocative bass rumbles, all providing a cushion for Trey’s velvety tenor, are the aural equivalent of scattered rose petals and lit candles. But the fantasy quickly fades: almost every song doubles down on the #meninist platitudes and reductive misogyny more than anything he’s released to date. <i>Intermission </i>feels like a conceptual homage to pick-up artist bible <a href=""https://www.neilstrauss.com/rules-of-the-game"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>The Game</span></a>.</p>
<p>""Don’t Play"" starts seductively enough, with its spacious, Jeremih-esque atmospherics, but quickly devolves into negging on wax. ""You got my time, girl, don’t you disrespect it,"" he huffs, barely concealing his impatience with his companion’s sexual ambivalence. ""Good Girls vs Bad Girls"" has Trigga reducing half the earth’s population to an Archie Comics trope, then wondering why he can’t seem to find meaning within this sad binary.</p>
<p>""Boss"", perhaps unwittingly, provides the EP’s only real moment of vulnerability. The track borrows a feeling from Drake circa 2010 (a time when Drizzy needed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5DySYu5Bfw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trey’s co-sign</a> to get a leg up, strange as that may seem now), not just in mood and cadence, but in the same defensive paranoia, obsessed with the idea that women are attracted by his status and adjusting his expectations accordingly. ""I don’t judge her, don’t judge her/ But I could never love her/ ‘Cause I’m just an entertainer/ And soon she gon’ fuck another,"" he sings, a riff on Drake's guarded <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRLSQDCkcaA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miss Me""</a> verse and a flash of context for the surrounding callousness. But it still doesn’t make the project’s overwhelming misogyny any easier to swallow, sexy as the sound may be. It’s a move as perplexing as it is disappointing. Meninist flailing is for dudes struggling to overcome their terrible personalities, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>. And <i>Intermission</i>’s spite towards women is especially baffling considering they comprise the vast majority of his fandom. What part of The Game is that?</p></div>"|20527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20527-intermission-ep/|6.4|Meaghan Garvey

YOU’RE SAD NOW!!! NOW YOU’RE SAD!!! EVERYBODY’S SAD NOW!</i> <i>YEAAAAHHH!!!!</i>""<i> </i>The thunderous applause lets you know that everyone in attendance on this first night is in on the joke: Adams is big enough to play Carnegie Hall now, because thousands of people have discovered that listening to Ryan Adams alone is akin to giving your sadness a spa day. But ""Come Pick Me Up"" actually transforms into something <i>uplifting </i>in a live setting these days. For both the performer and the audience, “Rescue Blues” and “Why Do They Leave” and “Amy” are bittersweet, nostalgic and a platform for wisecracks and anecdotes. The audience arrives with their dates and laugh at Ryan Adams, who gets to laugh at himself. The original ache is gone and everyone can just admit to each other, ""man, weren't <i>those days</i> something?""</p>
<p><i>Live at Carnegie Hall</i> makes Adams’ impromptu comedy the main draw: somewhere within this three-and-a-half-hour package is one of the funniest standup records you’ll hear in 2015. And the subject of nearly all of Ryan Adams’ jokes is Ryan Adams. This is a career-spanning project, so ""Ryan Adams"" becomes a very, <i>very</i> broad topic. Adams offers countless punchlines about the prevalence of tears and rain in his music as well as his penchant for using this reputation to his advantage—""Probably like 86% of you are on Paxil, so you understand about depression. So... you're at a fucking Ryan Adams show,"" he cracks at one point.  </p>
<p>The most cutting material aims at Adams' most self-serious phase, also known as his ""New York"" phase. On records like <i>Gold</i> and <i>Love Is Hell</i>, Adams relied on New York City to grant his music instant gravitas and urbane legitimacy. It was literally personified on his biggest single (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmHgY_J63Ik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""New York, New York""</a>), and his residence in the East Village felt like method acting. At one point on <i>Carnegie Hall</i>, he claims <i>Love Is Hell</i> highlight ""Please Do Not Let Me Go"" as one of his proudest moments and a song he wrote out on a pizza box while stoned as fuck and ruminating on the purpose of shoes.</p>
<p><i>Live at Carnegie Hall</i> is available as a 10-song sampler and a 216-minute 6xLP, though both versions have the casual Ryan Adams fan in mind. This isn’t for the hardcore Ryan Adams fan, the kind who will claim to have bootlegged B-side comps and shelved records that bests anything he’ll ever publicly release. This isn’t Ryan Adams’ Greatest Hits or the Definitive Ryan Adams either, something that will appeal to Whiskeytown and <i>Heartbreaker</i> fans who’ve begrudgingly stuck with him when he presumably lost his damn mind in 2003 and his edge on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10363-easy-tiger/""><i>Easy Tiger</i></a>. The setlists are thorough, but disappointingly conservative, writing out nearly all of his divisive records—nothing from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/40-rock-n-roll/""><i>Rock N Roll</i></a> or <i>29</i>, just a handful of B-sides and only the <i>Love Is Hell</i> tracks long-established as fan favorites.</p>
<p>All of his selections here work beautifully with just an acoustic guitar as accompaniment, and it all manages to cast his recent work in a positive light. Since they’re all subject to the same arrangements and production, ""Am I Safe"" or ""Gimme Something Good"" can be judged on the same scale as ""Oh My Sweet Carolina"" and ""My Winding Wheel"". The performances themselves are flawless and the recording is as well; everything is so crisp and clear that Carnegie Hall might as well be your living room. But the later songs remain what they were on record: tuneful, workmanlike numbers that can’t possibly generate the emotional payload of <i>Heartbreaker</i> but aren’t really trying to. Ryan Adams' music often gets called ""effortless,"" which cuts both ways—it can sound elemental and eternal and also like something he dashed off in five minutes. He’s very much aware of <i>this</i> reputation as well—Adams ad libs a presumably impromptu funk number on piano based on a hypothetical text message exchange between Billy Ocean and Michael McDonald. </p>
<p>It all highlights the various odd turns Ryan Adams' persona has taken over the past 20 years. After his blatant crossover bid <i>Gold</i>, Adams released two records in two months—one was too ""rock"", the other was too ""sad"" and both were considered career-killers. He rebounded in 2005 with <i>three</i> albums that were vastly superior but no more compromising—in half a year, he was a honky-tonk traditionalist, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/42-cold-roses/"">a Deadhead</a> and Jeff Buckley. More recently, oddball vanity projects <i>Orion </i>and <i>1984 </i>give glimmers of hope that they may one day not be the exception to the rule set by <i>Ashes &amp; Fire </i>and <i>Ryan Adams. </i>But <i>Live at Carnegie Hall </i>is the <i>Ryan Adams </i>Ryan Adams, the one who redefined himself at 40 years old as three things no one thought he’d ever be: reliable, consistent and a consummate people pleaser.</p></div>"|20495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20495-live-at-carnegie-hall/|7.3|Ian Cohen

His journey from the edges of the avant-garde to touring with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> has an inexorable feel to it, as if Stetson pushed his way to prominence wielding nothing but the mighty sound wrung from his chosen instrument. Sarah Neufeld, a violinist who has been a permanent member of Arcade Fire since their second album, is a kindred spirit: She brings a highly unconventional ear to her instrument and also seems to wander between genres without much fuss. The pair even share an avid interest in yoga—Neufeld has opened a studio, and Stetson has talked about the role yoga plays in his discipline, both in assisting with his demanding circular-breath style and in the mindfulness it cultivates.</p>
<p>Neufeld and Stetson worked together on the score to the 2013 film<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2027064/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> Blue Caprice</i></a>, and on <i>Never were the way she was</i>, they achieve a kind of ecstatic communion. The eight pieces on the album feel simultaneously contemplative and busy—the sound of active minds idling in a lower gear. The record is fantastic morning music, its tone and pace mirroring the moment in the day when your thoughts are murmuring, not yet speaking, and all you sense are their shades. It is too eventful, its surface too agitated, to be ambient, but it might help you think more clearly anyway.</p>
<p>Neufeld and Stetson’s pieces start with something very simple and build layers that you can hear stack and slot into place. Stetson is a virtuoso, the sort of player whose technical feats change people’s perceptions of what his instrument can do.  But the pieces on <i>Never were the way she was</i> are laid out as simply and clearly as a children’s story. Each time, Neufeld and Stetson begin with an undulating pulse, their two instruments working busily to create the illusion of one massive one (some kind of amplified church organ, maybe, that hasn’t been created yet). Once they’ve hit this point, they hold there, letting the multifaceted sound soak in.</p>
<p>Each piece on the album has a different pulse, with its own quality and clarity: Neufeld’s eerily smooth bowing on ""Won’t be a thing to become"" mirrors Stetson’s long-breathed, even tone, creating a glassy and impenetrable sonic surface. On ""In the vespers"", Stetson flutters his fingers over a few keys, making a wailing, high-pitched riff, and Neufeld bows sharp double stops beneath it. It’s an anxious sound, and listening to the jagged little peaks and valleys it hits is its own perversely pleasurable discomfort.</p>
<p>The mood behind these pieces is amorphous, but there is a steely, elemental feel to the album that suggests pre-industrial times. On the unmistakably baleful ""With the dark hug of time"" Stetson’s hammering fingers on the keys make a ""CHUNK"" that suggests the sound of  a stomping kick drum, and he plays in the lowest ranges of his instrument, where the sub frequencies aren’t too far off from a drone-metal band. This kind of buzzing, physically upsetting drone is an inherently primordial sound, and the piece feels more than a little 2001-obelisk. The scrapes and thuds embedded in the otherwise smoothly rolling ""The rest of us"" send a similar message. Though the pieces are fleshed out with other small touches—other horns at the periphery, and uncanny wordless vocals—the foundation of the album rests on the power and warmth Stetson and Neufeld generate by themselves. <i>Never were the way she was</i> has a bracing air, an implicit reminder of the things that can be done with two instruments and two hands.</p></div>"|20289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20289-colin-stetson-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/|7.7|Jayson Greene

At the start of the '70s, the Englishman released two imaginative, mystifying folk-rock albums that were critically lauded but commercially stillborn. After low sales prompted his label dismissal, Fay decided not to press the issue. He retired to private life, started a family and recorded new tunes only for his own fulfillment.</p>
<p>Still, his reputation steadily spread among singer-songwriter literati, and those early albums became collector’s items. Reissues followed, along with a plea from <a href=""http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2012/12/06/bill-fay-the-aquarium-drunkard-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the young American producer Joshua Henry</a>: Make another record with me. On the resulting 12 songs, choirs emboldened Fay’s humble mantras about self-fulfillment, miniature orchestras afforded his modest folk songs symphonic splendor, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4314-jeff-tweedy/"">Jeff Tweedy</a> traded verses and shared choruses with one of his idols. Fay seemed like a singer who’d returned to reclaim the due he’d missed for an entire generation. <i>Life Is People</i> was his triumph over time.</p>
<p>But the new and muted <i>Who Is the Sender?</i> finds Fay coming down from that high. He expresses frustration and consternation with the world, its wars and persecutions, and prays that some force bigger than a singer behind a piano will someday repair it all. Fay sighs as much as he sings here. The once-soaring strings turn doleful, and harmonies that felt like life-affirming proclamations just three years ago now seem like cries for survival. The album’s only celebrity guest, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a> leader J. Spaceman, is relegated to near-anonymous background harmonies. Fay’s transition suggests a radically time-collapsed echo of Bob Dylan’s career between the early '80s and the late '90s, as he moved from <a href=""http://www.bobdylan.com/us/music/saved"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">religious exaltation</a> to <a href=""http://www.bobdylan.com/us/music/time-out-of-mind"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">end-times anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>""What on earth is happening? What have we done?"" Fay mutters over a somber piano stomp during ""Underneath the Sun"". The song is an observation in two parts: Fay first finds wonder in the nature around him, where trees climb skyward and squirrels scavenge for their refuse. When his gaze turns to people, though, he sees only the threat of bullets and bombs and the suspicion that society will ruin everything around it. That same resentment creeps into ""War Machine"", a smoldering excoriation of humanity’s animal instinct to kill by funding an army it doesn’t question. And the beautiful ballad ""The Freedom to Read"" tells the tale of the court-ordered immolation of a 16th-century Protestant labeled a heretic for translating the Bible into English. It’s as if, three years after promising universal redemption on ""The Healing Day"" or exploring the magic of miracles on ""Cosmic Concerto"", Fay has accepted that his songs have yet to make the world any less bitter or more benevolent.</p>
<p>But <i>Who Is the Sender?</i> runs deeper than blind kvetching:<i> </i>Fay’s Christianity, and his cautious optimism in its power, uplifts him. The gently rising ""Order of the Day"" treats the Book of Revelation like a balm. The banjo-backed ""Bring It on Lord"" is a prayer for peace and healing. Perhaps all this sounds off-putting and naïve, but on <i>Who Is the Sender</i>?,<i> </i>Fay emerges as the rare religious songwriter who talks about his God without imploring the audience to make it their God, too. His beliefs seem too personal for him to proselytize on their behalf, too wrapped up in his survival for him to justify them. On ""Something Else Ahead"", he even confesses that his doubts about religion have never really vanished but that maintaining his faith is his tool of perseverance. ""Let’s just hope there’s something else ahead,"" he sings sweetly above circling strings, ""that a life on Earth don’t just end.""</p>
<p>That sentiment resonates with the resurrection of Fay’s interrupted career. <i>Who Is the Sender?</i> effectively doubles his recorded output and moves him from the category of a curiosity who returned after a four-decade absence to make a third great album to someone perhaps capable of doing so in perpetuity. But Fay seems to have few regrets about the way things went, a question he addresses during the opener ""The Geese Are Flying Westward"". He follows the avian migration and wonders if he should have ventured far from home, too, if he would have been happier had he pursued his musical aspirations. But he concludes he’s grateful for the seasons and years he’s witnessed at home, the place that’s made the perspective of his late-life albums so very poignant.</p></div>"|20475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20475-bill-fay-who-is-the-sender/|7.4|Grayson Haver Currin

The least well-known of the three, Body High, was started in 2011 by Jerome Potter and Sam Griesemer. Performing together as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32365-dj-dodger-stadium/"">DJ Dodger Stadium</a>, and separately as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31877-jerome-lol/"">Jerome LOL</a> and Samo Sound Boy, the two producers have carved out a recognizable style in a handful of releases, using a small bag of tricks to unleash cascades of emotion and energy. <i>Begging Please</i>, Samo’s full-length debut, stays true to that style, while treading the most intimate territory the label has explored yet.</p>
<p>Body High was founded with a focus on raw club music. As it has slowly built a catalogue, that focus has come to signify a feeling rather than a specific set of genres. DJ Dodger Stadium’s 2014 debut album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19562-dj-dodger-stadium-friend-of-mine/""><i>Friend of Mine</i></a> was for the most part functional, danceable music, indebted to house and techno. But its purpose drove deeper: It strove to summon the exhausted freedom that three hours of dancing can bring with the immediacy of a lightning-clap.</p>
<p>Though many of the electro-soul tracks on <i>Begging Please</i> don’t have the momentum it takes to work in the club, they seek a similarly cathartic response from the listener. Guarded in his interviews, Samo has said several times that <i>Begging Please </i>is an album about the dissolution of a loving relationship (comparing it to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here,_My_Dear"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marvin Gaye’s <i>Here, My Dear</i></a>), but has given few other details. His more substantial thoughts and feelings about the break-up are channeled in the tracks here.</p>
<p><i>Friend of Mine</i> also built a functional narrative, even as each of its songs shuddered into uninhibited ecstasy. But <i>Begging Please </i>feels like a portrait as opposed to <i>Friend of Mine’s </i>landscape. Samo opts for more obvious variation within individual tracks, which reduces his album’s impact but also intensifies the feeling that you’re listening to something personal and specific. The power of a track like ""Feel Something"" doesn’t rest in the repetition of its operative vocal loop (""Make me feel…oh""). It appears when that loop is pushed aside for a brassy synth ascension that takes over the song about mid-way through.</p>
<p>Gaudy, enormous synths, about as subtle as Web 1.0 graphics, are a staple of <i>Begging Please</i>, appearing on other standouts like ""The Only Thing"", and the seven-and-a-half-minute centerpiece and title track. They feed the album’s general sense of camp; this is big, glorious Shirley Bassey melodrama, as is most apparent on the soulful closer, where a powerful voice rides atop the record’s wildest, most expressive percussion. </p>
<p>If <i>Begging Please </i>is a performance of heartbreak, it is a wry and self-aware one. Samo's light-fingered melodies go a long way toward balancing the boldness of his sound. That balance grants a sensitivity to most of the songs here. And it is quite obvious when absent, as on the album’s few misses, ""Baby Don’t Stop"" and ""What Can I Do"".</p>
<p>Because the music is so finely tuned and relies so fleetingly on sampled lyrics, even the simplest words take on powerful meaning, Samo speaking to us as directly as is possible for him. One of the album’s tracks, ""Save Wait Time"", is made by its refrain, which adds an extra word to that gloomy triplet, either ""go"" or ""no."" By removing this terminal word from the track’s title, introverted Samo signals his wish to preserve the moment, to freeze time in a portrait of what he once had. But, inevitably, the sample cuts out, the music fades, and the album begins its descent into heartbreak.</p></div>"|20431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20431-samo-sound-boy-begging-please/|7.5|Jonah Bromwich

For Sasha, money comes in bricks, and those she deigns to let go down will not stop—cannot stop—until she’s got hers. ""Getting hers"" is the thread which binds <i>Nutty World 2</i> together, and while ""getting mine"" is hardly an original theme for a rapper, Sasha repurposes its cliches like a Chanel suit. This has been Sasha’s greatest strength from the beginning; think of her back in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKl1ueffYFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What We Do""</a> video, flanked in an entryway by friends, in a blouse like strawberry taffy, white-belted jeans, and a crown of cherubic blonde curls before we see her reach into her bag and pull out a handgun roughly the size of her thigh.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The most striking thing about <i>Nutty World 2</i> is Sasha's palpable urgency; <span>she normally raps with a measured flow, her poise and tempo turning the beat into a catwalk. </span></span><i>Nutty World 2 </i><span>finds her rapping with a nimble aggression she has simply not shown before. The motivation for this more dangerous version of Sasha is spelled out in opener ""Vision"": ""As long as I’m eating/ My daughter won’t starve/ She the main reason/ That I’m going hard."" That maternal ferocity is maintained throughout the record. </span>Addressing her daughter first thing sets <i>Nutty World 2</i>’s pace and tone. Whether it's familial security, money, respect, or head, the message is the same. ""I pick today/ To have fun,"" she sings on the hook of ""Today"", and though the stakes on that proclamation feel slightly lower, the agency is still present. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As if to balance her newfound power, the production—the majority of it handled by YoungHazOnTheBeat—is fairly standard, albeit well done, drill-esque fare, wide, dark and domineering. The few tracks which deviate the most—namely the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a>-in-the-club ""All I See"" and ""Niggas Ain’t Shit"", which evokes<a href=""http://frommagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/PastedGraphic-1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> pepto-Zoro Kellz</a> and Cassidy in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKOT6teSarY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hotel""</a>—do so in a complementary manner; ""All I See"" in particular is just bizarre enough. When paired with Sasha's blunt-force rapping, th<span>e straightforward, unabashedly strong production seems defiant rather than dated.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The good-but-not great beat selection is, in the end, less a hindrance than a strength. When taken with <i>Nutty World</i> 2’s deft sequencing—just enough songs flowing together, just the right amount of tags and ""This Chicago …""s and DJ promotion—it leaves the new, fiercer Sasha as the main attraction. In rapping over what she knows better than she ever has before, <i>Nutty World 2</i> becomes equal part herald and warning shot; Sasha is getting hers, and she is coming for yours next.</p></div>"|20494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20494-nutty-world-2/|6.9|B.

He thrives in gray areas, animated by the electricity generated by the tension of his own contradictions, and he never, ever offers a straightforward explanation. Look how he handled the most surreal rap beef of 2015 in a recent <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/1Tq9SARz-J/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram message</a> to Lil Wayne. ""This is my idol. I won’t ever in my life swap words with him,"" Thug pledged—days away from releasing his imminent debut album, <i>Carter 6</i>, a title hijacked from Wayne, whose own<i> Carter V</i> languished in Cash Money purgatory. But then, in closing: ""<i>Ha haaa</i>,"" punctuated with a trollish tongue wag. Like most everything Thugger has done in the last year and a half, it made people confused: What kind of god-level shade was this? Is he taking any of this remotely seriously? And what in fuck’s sake is his endgame with this album, the name of which changed days before its release to <i>Barter 6</i> after Wayne threatened to sue? <i>Barter 6</i> was already the year’s most controversial rap album—or ""retail mixtape,"" as if the distinction really matters—before it even dropped.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <i>Barter 6</i> has almost nothing to do with Lil Wayne, save its provocative title (which I’m saying is more <a href=""http://collections.lacma.org/node/239578"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Treachery of Images</a> than aimless troll, anyway) and a handful of scattered lyrical shots. Idol or not, Thug hasn’t directly emulated Wayne since his debut tape, 2011’s <i>I Came From Nothing</i>. But he’s always seemed to delight in playful misdirection, quietly reveling in the chaos provoked by his mere existence, from the <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/j2vSeRRz5H/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vaguely gender-bending fashions</a> to the <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/sdkfrERz_a/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pet names for his friends</a>. Thug seems to recognize the power of his own mystique, headline-grabbing yet somehow unknowable: ""Every time I dress myself, I go muhfucking viral,"" he crows, bemused, on ""Halftime"". And on <i>Barter 6</i>, Thug yet again dodges any easy narrative. Far from a public idol-killing, or zany sideshow, it’s composed, patient, even subtle—an album neither fans nor detractors saw coming.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Over the course of his three-part <i>I Came From Nothing</i> tape series, Thug’s now-singular voice took shape. The projects often felt like extended stylistic experiments, ranging wildly in quality—but when inspiration struck, it sounded like nothing else coming out of his Atlanta hometown, from guileless <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6iQAEL7fHA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outsider-pop ballads</a> to completely unclassifiable <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg0DcKvrhy4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vocal performance clinics</a>. By 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17891-young-thug-1017-thug/""><i>1017 Thug</i></a>, Thug’s ""weirdness"" had become an easy hook, a rapper who sang and hollered odes to lean and compared his jewelry to Pokémon. Early 2014 singles ""Stoner"" and ""Danny Glover"" plopped Thug on the threshold of the mainstream, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32661-rich-gang/"">Rich Gang</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12128-birdman/"">Birdman</a>-conceived duo of Thug and kindred spirit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a>, spawned the radiant single ""Lifestyle"".</p>
<p>There is no ""Lifestyle"" on <i>Barter 6</i><b>,</b> nor is it particularly ""weird.""<b> </b>Opening track ""Constantly Hating"" unfurls gently, its impressionistic Wheezy beat leaving space between bass tremors for Thug to explore.  There are hardly any big-name collaborators here: ""Can’t Tell"", with its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"">T.I.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32643-boosie-badazz/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Boosie</a> appearances, is the least integral track, despite its star power. It<b> </b>reflects none of the clamor of Thugger’s dramatic 2015. Instead, <i>Barter 6</i> argues that his greatest asset all along was not his wackiness, his ""outsider"" status, or his surprising inner hitmaker—it’s not even his voice, or at least, not entirely. It’s Thug’s uncanny and singular way of piecing a song together, a skill he has doubled down on with this release: a way with vocal technique, melody, and detail-oriented composition that makes the bizarre seem approachable and the familiar feel new. </p>
<p>He plies those compositional talents here to the cohesive rap album, a format Thug had shown very little prior indication he was interested in at all. He treats the smallest compositional details with the care and craftsmanship of a chorus—<i>everything</i> here is a hook, from the ad-libs (a term that feels insufficient—Thug’s ""ad-libs"" are fully integrated into the song’s structure, to the point where we should probably just call them backing vocals) to the individual bars to the empty spaces. <i>Barter 6</i> is not a world-conquering album; instead, it digs tunnels.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">More than anything, <i>Barter 6</i> feels like a 50-minute performance of what rap, as a form, can do: rap that need not transcend itself, towards High Art on one hand or commercial art on the other, in order to succeed in 2015. Thug’s rapping itself, known for its unpredictability, is sharper than ever; his voice feels clarified, strengthened. Take ""Halftime"", the most thrilling technical display here, on which Thug seamlessly snaps into a dozen different flows: casually extending the second syllable of ""re-cy-cles"" so that it threatens to throw the song off track entirely, pausing a beat, unleashing a quick guffaw, snapping back on beat. It's an almost-reckless balance-beam routine. He pauses only for an ingenious vocoder breakdown that melts his cries of ""Havin’ the time of my muhfuckin’ liiiiiife"" into semiotic ooze, suddenly giving the blood-red backdrop of the cover art an almost <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaXm4qsbxQE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lynchian </a>cast, like the velveteen Black Lodge interior.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Every element exists for a reason, fitting like puzzle pieces into place over multiple listens: even the guest spots from presumable weed carriers like Duke (formerly MPA) and Yak Gotti put in work. Haunting, virtuosic final act ""Just Might Be"" gives Thug’s moments of silence the primacy of a hook: ""That’s called breathing, that’s how you let that bitch breathe,"" he sighs after a verse of rapid-fire double-time, leading into a cathartic exhale that spans a full eight bars.</span><span> This is the anti-""Let the Beat Build"", on an album that’s the anti-</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11608-tha-carter-iii/""><i>Carter III</i></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-0077eaba-dd32-759c-8f36-871690e38e18"">And as for Thug’s widely-touted unintelligibility, <i>Barter 6</i> argues that all we need to do is listen a bit more carefully: what may not be legible at first glance reveals itself patiently over time. In this sense, you are doing it wrong by asking Young Thug his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzzY-rJ1Pv8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thoughts on Ferguson</a> point-blank, as one reporter did last fall. Thug bristled then, responding with what looked like apathy. But there is no ambiguity on ""OD"" when he cries, ""RIP Mike Brown, fuck the cops"" (nor was there, for that matter, on his gut-wrenching 2013 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHc2phyv1Hk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trayvon Martin tribute</a>). He will speak when he’s ready, and on his own terms: abstracted, maybe, but ultimately loud and clear.</span></p></div>"|20529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20529-barter-6/|8.4|Meaghan Garvey

It's coded into their lyrics and built into the young Philadelphia band's blown-out grooves, which match swaggering soul force with a defiant punk spirit. Sheer Mag might reference 1970s classic rock every time they holler and shred, but their gnarled, whiskey-fueled pop-in-miniature is of a singular breed: There aren't many contemporary bands you could imagine unironically covering ""Sweet Home Alabama"" while some bloody-lipped fan stage-dives. Such is the essence of Sheer Mag's raw power.</p>
<p>Four-fifths of Sheer Mag met at the arty New York state school SUNY Purchase, and this supremely catchy new four-song EP—the second from Sheer Mag since last fall—comes out with the support of <a href=""http://katorgaworks.bigcartel.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Katorga Works</a>, a small Brooklyn label that deals primarily in hardcore à la Lotus Fucker and Stoic Violence. Compact, handmade, and busy with ideas, the sound is akin to riff-rock on Adderall; lead guitarist Kyle Seely knows just when to reel in the epic, bedroom-recorded solos, which sound like they're blaring out a boombox plucked from a dumpster. As someone who is of the same age bracket as the members of this band, their music reminds me of the hits spilling from the '70s radios in the '90s teen movie <i>Now and Then</i>—Free, Stevie Wonder, the Jackson 5—if the TV was busted and staticy.</p>
<p>On all fronts, Sheer Mag's salty-sweet music understands pop's pleasure center. They retain the architectural elements that punk seeks to ignore or unteach: the aerodynamic pull of a chiseled pre-chorus guitar melody or middle-eight before the inevitable fade-out. A slow thump and cascading riff pulls ""Fan the Flames"" open, echoing the major-key coils of ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" or any number of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22962-lynyrd-skynyrd/"">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a> singles. Sheer Mag's aesthetic is scrappy, but not casual, and like their previous self-titled EP, these soda-pop rippers will soundtrack the foreseeable future of dance-parties for young people who can't dance.</p>
<p>And there is Christina Halladay at the middle of it all, her gale-force voice full of grit and resilience. Formerly of Philly band the Shakes, you can find Halladay in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhc0RQa4diY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the depths</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLT8ixr2LlQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">of YouTube</a>, at a rowdy house show delivering covers of Aretha and Otis Redding and Smokey Robinson, whose collective influence is palpable. (Her early rock'n'roll charisma may recall Oakland garage-punk band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29627-shannon-and-the-clams/"">Shannon and the Clams</a>.) Having grown up on Long Island, Halladay <a href=""northforker.com/2015/01/31/mattituck-natives-band-featured-rolling-stones-10-new-artists-need-know/"" target=""_blank"">says</a> her songs deal in ""[her] struggle of living in a city when [she] was raised in a small town—and sometimes wondering why [she's] there."" The debut EP's piercing <a href=""https://sheermag.bandcamp.com/track/sit-and-cry"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sit and Cry""</a> articulated this well, a wistful ode to the physical and psychological trap of big city life: ""All I do is sit and cry/ Living in the city and I don't know why/ Doing nothing but struggling to get by."" Thematically, <i>II</i> takes this conflicted pose as its starting point, carrying forth the us-versus-them story that has comprised the theater of punk rock for decades.</p>
<p><i>II</i>'s lyrics are more explicitly politicized than <i>Sheer Mag</i>; these are fight songs with a folk sensibility, images of laced boots and raised fists and cross-sections of history (one is even called ""Whose Side Are You On""). ""When you see something that makes you sick/ Do you button up or do you bleed?"" Halladay shouts at the outset of ""Button Up""; as she sings the blues of city life, she protests injustices of class and gentrification. On rallying cry ""Fan the Flames"", she describes crooked landlords, trash-ridden streets, broken windows, vacant homes alongside pretty ones. ""When our neighbors burned/ It was only because of telephone cords,"" Halladay sings, adding, ""The realtors shook hands with their backs turned.""</p>
<p>By pairing these ringing sentiments with Thin Lizzy and Skynyrd riffs, Sheer Mag subvert and repurpose the crude attitude of cock rock, not dissimilar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3829-sleater-kinney/"">Sleater-Kinney</a>'s early <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=540hqevOEbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> of Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"", or more recently, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32045-ex-hex/"">Ex Hex</a> on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19891-ex-hex-rips/""><i>Rips</i></a>. Accordingly, anticonformist anthem ""Button Up"" is the best song here. Halladay spits fire, demolishing expectation—she won't bite her tongue or curtsy or take any of your shit. ""You don't know who you're tanglin' with/ I'm a bad bitch if I please,"" she threatens, ""I've done it before and I'll do it again/ I brought many a man to his knees."" You could picture this venom coming from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>. And yet, despite the arena-sized influences they wear on their sleeves, Sheer Mag are decidedly gruffer than anything you'd hear on the radio, then or now. And that humanizing dirt-under-the-nails is an essential repellant. The yuppies are always lurking.</p></div>"|20408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20408-ii-ep/|8.1|Jenn Pelly

It’s evidence of mirroring, an essential element of identity formation, relationship building, and confidence: I see something of myself in you/your work—let’s try a thing. Ultimately, the best collaboration is about ceding control, which is rare amongst the alpha personalities that dominate rap. But the truth is, most of the best rap isn’t made in a vacuum with just a Dropbox of raw, outsourced beats, but from a certain collaborative dance duet. Take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14362-guru/"">Guru</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"">MF DOOM</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse/"">Clipse</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"">the Neptunes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"">YG</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"">Killer Mike</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"">El-P</a>.</p>
<p>What makes this dynamic even more interesting is when one of the partners is multi-talented. Like Madlib or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> before him, on <i>The Night Took Us in Like Family</i> producer and rapper Jeremiah Jae relinquishes his own production know-how to focus on rapping. Jae’s production work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>’ hallucinatory <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30595-captain-murphy/"">Captain Murphy</a> project and his own projects for <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> and <a href=""http://warp.net/artists/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a> are often abrasive and off kilter; unlike his partner L’Orange’s production work on <i>The Night</i>, it is hardly ever obviously soulful. Even when Jae tweaks a classic it always sounds a little foreboding, like macerating the hot sugar of Aretha Franklin’s voice by boring into the downbeat and detuning her on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jeremiahjae/onetwo-step-her-booty"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his 2010 flip of her ""One Step Ahead""</a> (best known as the sample for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2838-mos-def/"">Mos Def</a>’s ""Ms. Fat Booty""). The ghost of that song can be heard on <i>The Night</i> in the smoky, soulful, sped-up swing of ""Part Two: God Complex"", which one of a handful of short instrumental interludes that helps set the album’s Bogart-soused, B&amp;W tone.</p>
<p>If the clips of film dialogue don’t give it away then the mid-century camp will, from jazz and lounge samples, down to the fingersnaps (""The Lineup""). This is an aesthetic concept record (billed, cringingly, as ""noir hop"") that teasingly ponders the idea of gangster rap from another era—pre-<i>Scarface</i>, for once. It’s an interesting approach, especially for illuminating the way popular culture has nefariously oversimplified the image of the ""gangster""—a phrase often used as a contemptuous shorthand for rappers in particular, and black men more broadly—throughout time.</p>
<p>Like the swarthy-voiced Bogart, Jae’s distinctive mumble—mumblier, even, than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>—plays unreliable narrator over these 18 tracks. Call it method rapping. One minute he’s confident and smug (on the fast-slow bop of ""The Lineup"") and the next he lurks (""Invisible in a drop, invisible you cannot see me, don't let the cops see""). But he’s mostly paranoid, dogged by frauds and foes, and concerned with getting ""down like James Brown when them rounds go off."" L’Orange builds a gilded stage from a clutter of film, soul, and synth samples, refurbishing the worn 9th Wonder/early-Kanye warped soul template. It’s a pretty seamless pairing; these two have similar ideas about the completeness of a piece of music.</p></div>"|20456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20456-jeremiah-jae-lorange-the-night-took-us-in-like-family/|7.1|Anupa Mistry

The second ""Ann the Word"" is a cover of a song by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2559-lungfish/"">Lungfish</a>, a group that was Clark’s labelmate back when he fronted the <a href=""http://www.dischord.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dischord Records</a> outfit <a href=""http://www.dischord.com/band/smart-went-crazy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smart Went Crazy</a> in the late '90s; here, the primordial dread of the original is scooped out, and the void is filled with sample-heavy layering. After Clark chants Daniel Higgs’ eschatological poetry, Cook comes in at the end and gets angelic, repeating, ""The world vanished in a gentle breeze.""</p>
<p>In recent years, Clark himself almost met his end, and not so gently. In 2007 he was diagnosed with a viral heart ailment that he battled, off and on, for the next few years—up to and including multiple open-heart surgeries. For months on end, he didn’t have the strength to play the guitar. His struggles put the brakes on Beauty Pill, whose lone full-length for Dischord, 2004’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/317-beauty-pill/"">The Unsustainable Lifestyle</a></i>, continued in the art-pop direction that Clark had established in Smart Went Crazy—with muddled results. But in 2006, Clark began exploring a new direction for Pill with a demo of ""Ann the Word"" (his song, not the cover), which broke from guitar-bass-drums to probe the freer domain of laptop arrangement, electro-acoustics, and samples.</p>
<p>On <i>D</i><i>escribes Things as They Are, </i>he finally fulfills the promise of this direction, which proves fruitful and wise.<i> </i>The album is a smorgasbord of angles, melodies, loops, pockets, and fractal surfaces that nonetheless refuse to deviate from Clark’s longstanding bailiwick: the mythic power of the pop hook. He loves to unfold his songs as if they’re some kind of four-dimensional puzzle; ""Ain’t a Jury in the World Gon Convict You Baby"" launches on an almost industrially severe beat before the organic squish of drones and symphonic surges trickle in. It’s a big-screen anthem that addresses nationalism in a cultural climate of paranoia and recrimination, but it also packs scads of auditory information into a streamlined slither. Rather than milk his life-threatening illness for all of its lyrical worth, Clark uses it here more as a catalyst than source of raw material. In fact, in the few instances where he <i>does</i> address his illness—as on ""Near Miss Stories"", where he sings breezily over disembodied guitar, ""Stethoscope on my chest, he says we better do this fast/ One of these beats of your heart is gonna be the last""—he speaks through hints and distances, and even a punch line: ""The surgeon once practiced on a blood orange in an art class.""</p>
<p>Clark performs his own kind of surgery all over <i>Describes Things as They Are, </i>which is filled with punchy, brassy scrambles of samples and skittering drums.<i> ""</i>Drapetomania"" sounds like Art of Noise spliced with New Jack Swing. But for every manic experiment there is a pulsing, pretty, pop collage like ""Dog with Rabbit in Mouth Unharmed"". Clark’s postmodern pedigree shows on ""For Pretend"", a clatter of percussion and pinging guitar that also sports one of Clark’s most arresting melodies. If there is a drawback to <i>Describes</i>, it is that a few songs rely a little too heavily on Beauty Pill’s limited back of sonic tricks, whose impact dims slightly after prolonged exposure.</p>
<p>""Ann the Word"" isn’t the only cover song on <i>Describes Things as They Are</i>. Clark and crew also offer a rendition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2490-arto-lindsay/"">Arto Lindsay</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZLa7XQZuxQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Prize""</a>—only in this case, it’s highly faithful, right down to the muscular beat, lush strings, and faint brushes of Tropicália. Compare this reverent cover to his radically deconstructed take on Lungfish, the album's only visible link to Clark's past, and you can see where Clark's inclinations lie. In ""Exit Without Saving"", he sings, with taunting sweetness, ""You recognize that this is noise, right?/ You still want it?"" Clark had to wait over a decade to offer us his vision for what Beauty Pill could be, and he poses this question on <i>Describes</i><i> Things as They Are</i> with delicacy and daring. The restless, breathless music makes clear that whatever the answer might be, he's not waiting around for it.</p></div>"|20514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20514-beauty-pill-beauty-pill-describes-things-as-they-are/|7.5|Jason Heller

Decades into her storied career, she remains a force to be reckoned with. </span></p>
<p>Her latest release is a four-song EP with Son Little: two originals and two new versions of songs long associated with the Staple Singers. The man born Aaron Livingston has only a single solo EP to his name, last year’s under-the-radar <i>Things I Forgot</i>, but he is better known for his collaborations with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">Roots</a> (that’s him singing on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16102-the-roots-undun/"">Undun</a></i>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3581-rjd2/"">RJD2</a> (the duo record under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29842-icebird/"">Icebird</a>). Stylistically, he inhabits buffer zones between genres and traditions: a little bit of blues and old-school R&amp;B, but with a strong grounding in hip-hop. Little produced Staples’ latest EP, wrote two of these four songs, and played most of the instruments, and he comes across like a man who can’t quite believe he’s working with someone of Staples’ stature.</p>
<p>""Why did you spend all your good fortune on me?"" Mavis sings on the opening track, drawing out that first syllable gravely and letting that final pronoun fade quickly and humbly. The song echoes the gospel sentiments she has been preaching all her life, and the melodic cadence of the verses are perfectly suited to her delivery. Little produces ""Your Good Fortune"" to gently update or at least comment on the Staples sound: His guitar playing obviously mimics Pops’ signature tone. It’s a powerful performance by both singer and producer, yet ultimately it doesn’t sound like Little wrote it for Mavis. Instead, it sounds like he wrote it <i>to</i> her.</p>
<p>Little wisely keeps the arrangements straightforward, backing Staples with only a few instruments: guitar, bass, looped drums (or drums that sound looped), and a keyboard flourish every once in a while. Instead of spare, however, the songs occasionally sound crowded, as though the music is closing in on Staples. That can be intriguing on ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"", a cover of the Staple Singers’ cover of the Blind Lemon Jefferson tune, which conveys the song title's grim finality. ""Wish I Had Answered"", however, sounds a bit choked, never quite hitting the groove that handclaps and tambourine are meant to suggest.</p>
<p>Pops wrote ""Wish I Had Answered"" in the 1960s, years before the Staples would reach the peak of their popularity, and Mavis sings his words as though threading a life’s worth of spiritual regret into three minutes. Not only has her voice gained power with age, but her sheer presence, as a living reminder of pop's social conscience, is commanding. She is a living reminder of the idea that musicians have a great responsibility to the world.</p>
<p>That much comes through on Little’s second original, the righteous ""Fight"", on which Mavis surveys a range of social ills and invites us to help her solve them. She may not be talking specifically about RFRA, income inequality, or Black Lives Matter, but it’s impossible to hear the song in 2015 and not think of these and other pressing issues. ""Talking about Jesus but you treat people dead wrong,"" she declares in that voice that exudes moral authority and spiritual generosity. ""Freedom and justice, they ain’t your playthings."" Seldom has she sounded so accusing or so scolding, as though she can’t believe she has to keep telling us all to treat each other with respect and dignity. It takes her a bit outside her comfort zone, which is exciting for an artist of any age and makes the promise of a longer collaboration with Son Little sound particularly glorious.</p></div>"|20498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20498-your-good-fortune-ep/|6.8|Stephen M.

The Athens, Ala. band were part of a ""Memphis Soul"" revue celebrating that city’s groundbreaking '60s sounds, which famously featured black and white musicians working together to make lasting hits like ""Hold On, I'm Comin'"" in the thick of the civil rights era. The visual symbolism of the event was powerful, a historically rich triumph of the unity that soul music has often portended: As the nation’s first black president looked on, multiracial Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard led her band of white instrumentalists—along with Memphis greats Booker T. Jones and Steve Cropper—on the classic 1967 blues track ""Born Under a Bad Sign"". Barack and Michelle nodded their heads in respectful rhythm. Malia seemed mildly amused. Sasha, meanwhile, was bored. Like, <i>remarkably</i> bored. Her flat stare was the type usually reserved for dentist waiting rooms or Target customer service lineups. Her obligatory golf clap at the end of the song was wan to the point of noiselessness.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Howard, for her part, could probably see where the youngest Obama was coming from. During the performance, the singer paced impatiently, seemingly humbled by the pageantry and also perhaps feeling a little constricted by the antiquity of it all. It wasn’t that Howard and her band didn’t know their blues; the working-class quartet came from a small town in the mythic South and cut their teeth on hours-long sets of covers. And when the frontwoman belted, ""Hard luck and trouble been my only friend/ I been on my own ever since I was 10,"" the lines held pointed meaning for Howard since she lost her older sister—and only sibling—to cancer when she was around that age. But for all their preternatural grit, sweat, and passion (along with every other age-old signifier of rock'n'roll authenticity known to man), Alabama Shakes were never quite comfortable with the retro-soul box many placed them into upon their arrival in 2012. To be fair, their debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16479-boys-and-girls/""><i>Boys &amp; Girls</i></a>, certainly deserved the tag, its vintage moves elevated mostly by Howard’s gale-force delivery, an instrument that could have blown Otis Redding back. The band’s effortless charm, instant familiarity, and Great Recession recovery anthem ""Hold On"" made them easy to root for, and the album went onto sell more than 700,000 copies. It felt as if they could be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at any moment.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And yet, the idea taking on the mantle of '60s soul was never part of the plan for Alabama Shakes. In interviews, they casually distanced themselves from the pure revivalists of <a href=""http://daptonerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daptone Records</a> while repping for theatrical sensationalists like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and My Chemical Romance; their origin story had Howard noticing bassist Zac Cockrell because he was wearing an At the Drive-In shirt; when the band hit ""Saturday Night Live"" recently, Howard wore earrings emblazoned with Prince’s face. ""We just don’t wanna own the classic R&amp;B title and let people down,"" guitarist Heath Fogg <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXu-JY8d-I4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">diplomatically stated</a> around the release of <i>Boys &amp; Girls</i>, ""because when we go electronic on the next record it might break some hearts.""</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Sound &amp; Color</i> is not an electronic record. But it is strange and mystical and unexpected—more <i>Houses of the Holy</i> than <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qANTSHIivRY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Holy Cow""</a>. It’s got past lives and future people, traces of Curtis Mayfield, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah Badu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a>. There’s a song called ""Shoegaze"" that could find a second home on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"" target=""_blank"">the Rolling Stones</a>’ <i>Tattoo You</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a> collaborator Rob Moose provides eerie string arrangements that slowly encroach on songs like ivy climbing up a fence while the band and co-producer Blake Mills tweak tones and rhythms to make guitars and drums and bass and keyboards sound genuinely exciting—fresh, even—in 2015. This is stadium soul with one eye peeking toward another galaxy while hands and feet and throats desperately try to suss out life here on Earth.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course, Howard is at the center of it all. Over the course of the last three years, she’s managed to take complete control over her unbridled voice without losing a smidge of spontaneity. She’s no longer just building toward an ecstatic climax (though there are several of those here), but rather exploring the upper reaches of her register, cajoling instead of hollering, taking on operatic cadences. The singer, who took part in both raucous Baptist services as well as a cappella hymns in the Church of Christ growing up, layers her vocals on almost every track, offering harmonies and ghosts that can’t help but follow her around; on one bipolar love song, what sounds like ghoulish laughter echoes behind Howard as she pours her being into the words ""gimme all your love!"" Is she reveling in her desires? Sending up her larger-than-life voice? Smiling into the void of unrequited love? Yes, yes, and yes.</p>
<p class=""p3"">As a lyricist, Howard excels at spinning down-home profundity that make her sound her age, 26, and years beyond. Along with her tales of haunted love, cautious optimism, and impassioned pacifism come more impressionistic songs that mean to find connections between epochs and space. She and her band travel through the blues back to a bad sign—or is it a good one?—on ""Gemini"", a six-and-a-half-minute excursion into zero-gravity funk. Whereas Alabama Shakes once seemed destined to relive the history of others, they invent their own genesis here, as weeds grow near the Tennessee River and eyes reveal dreams that eventually must wake up. And just as the song comes to a close, it keeps going for a little while longer.</p></div>"|20420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20420-sound-color/|8.1|Ryan Dombal

Occasionally, they ebbed toward more introspective spiritual music, but their legacy lies in their status as a lost proto-punk band: They came close to breaking through—the famous story is that Clive Davis said he’d sign them if they changed their name. David refused and they quietly broke up in 1977.</span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course, that’s not the end of the story. When <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a><span style=""color: #222222;""> released their archival material, Bobby and Dannis, joined by Bobbie Duncan on guitar, started playing the old stuff to rapturous receptions. Their narrative in recent years, outlined well by the documentary <a href=""http://abandcalleddeath.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>A Band Called Death</i></a><span style=""color: #222222;"">, goes roughly like this: ""Whoa, who are this band Death? Wait, <i>they're still around</i>? Holy shit, they’re playing in front of me right now! This is awesome!"" And it could’ve stayed that way, too. Thanks to the nature of their return, Death's very presence in this century is an exciting prospect. </span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>N.E.W.</i> is their first collection of new stuff since they split in the 1970s (aside from one 1990s one-off that appeared on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19228-death-iii/"" target=""_blank""><i>III</i></a>) and quietly moved on to play in other bands (reggae and Christian rock outfits among them). It's also their first recorded output without the band's spiritual center and creative mastermind David, who died in 2000. Sure enough, it sounds like Death. They move along at a beefy rock'n'roll chug; they rip through impressive guitar solos; their rhythms are unpredictable. They scream and they growl. At their best, Death 2015 deliver the chest-beating, all-power proto-punk that made people flip when they heard <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAZ9R2t5Jd0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Keep on Knocking""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl3FstCc_OY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Politicians in My Eyes""</a> for the first time. And structurally speaking, ""Relief"" is one of their best songs ever—a muscular earworm with a shout-along chorus, screaming breakdowns, and some well-done (and understated) guitar work from Duncan.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unfortunately, that song also represents the biggest problem with <i>N.E.W.</i>: each theme and message is oversold. ""Detroit rocks,"" they shout, but decide that's probably too specific. ""East Coast rocks! West Coast rocks! The whole world rocks!"" At times, their lyrics are cornball and completely devoid of nuance. If we’ve learned anything from Death’s fellow Michigander <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/93-andrew-wk/"">Andrew W.K.</a> (or other maximal carpe diem screamers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2218-junior-senior/"">Junior Senior</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30420-icona-pop/"">Icona Pop</a>), aggressively positive music works best when it’s pitched right over the top. Death rarely hit full boil. Their performances are technically impressive but feel tepid. <br/><br/>Understandably, their journey is a central narrative on <i>N.E.W.</i> At this point, though, the band's biography has been well-documented. When they sing about existing in the underground, how they ""feel the love"" now that they've been brought to the light, and note that ""the fun has just begun"" on ""Resurrection"", the message feels superfluous. Watch Death perform in the closing scenes of <i>A Band Called Death</i>—every word of ""Resurrection"" is spelled out more eloquently and concisely in the Hackneys' earnest, smiling expressions. The themes of resurrection, return, and revival are implicit to the album's mere existence, and the Hackneys do a better job of navigating those concepts when they leave some room for subtext (""Who Am I"").</p>
<p class=""p1"">Death were worthy of thinkpieces and a documentary because their very good, very heavy recordings predated and portended punk without actually influencing it. The rock'n'roll playing field is drastically different at this point in their careers—they're operating in a sprawling, endless landscape of heavy guitar music. Unlike <i>...For the Whole World to See</i>, <i>N.E.W.</i> does not sound like a lost proto-punk classic; it's just a pretty good rock record made by guys who have been at it for a long time. They're much older men now, and if you can get past some of their more embarrassing phrases (most of ""Playtime""), you'll find a band who are still very good at their bread and butter.</p></div>"|20530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20530-new/|6.3|Evan Minsker

That was the year that Radioclit—a duo of UK-based beat makers Etienne Tron and Johan Karlberg—and Malawian-born, London-based vocalist Esau Mwamwaya hopped on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a>'s ""Paper Planes"". Sampling <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkyCrx4DyMk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Clash's ""Straight to Hell""</a>, this British punk beat about Vietnamese bastard children of American GIs, as appropriated by a Sri Lankan refugee, and in turn recast by a Swede-French-African amalgam as ""Tengazako"" doubled as hip-pop utopia. But the world's turned plenty since then, from M.I.A.'s one-finger Super Bowl salute to a Kenyan-American presidency. And seven years on, the giddy pleasures of a Europop/African mash-up has become, if not exactly commonplace, then no longer the aural speedball it once was.</p>
<p>The Very Best (now a duo of Karlberg and Mwamwaya) did euphoric, Afro dance pop with their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13518-warm-heart-of-africa/"">2009 debut</a> and then widened their scope and Rolodex with 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16835-mtmtmk/""><i>MTMTMK</i></a>. Their sleekest album to date, it shoehorned in the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/247-amadou-mariam/"">Amadou &amp; Miriam</a>, Senegalese singer Baaba Maal, frequent David Guetta vocalist Taio Cruz, Somali-Canadian rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7518-knaan"">K'naan</a>, and even Bruno Mars, making them all heel to their African sun-bright sound. Guest credits on their third album, <i>Makes a King</i>, include another <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a> member (Chris Baio this time rather than Ezra Koenig, who contributed to their debut), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29550-the-vaccines/"">the Vaccines</a>'s guitarist Freddie Cowan, and EDM newcomer Jutty Ranx, but it’s hard to pick out individual contributions. And for the most part, even the Very Best know that they can’t remain only at the ecstatic end of the musical spectrum.</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, <i>Makes a King</i> was rendered on Malawian soil, but now the Very Best are settled in the lakeside village of M’dala Chikowa rather than the country’s capital Lilongwe. And while <i>MTMTMK</i> at times had the odd feel of a superclub transposed to that impoverished African country, <i>King</i> rarely aims for the club stratosphere early on. Instead, it feels much closer to the earth and sounds most comfortable there: Low-key electronic buzzes around the opening call and response of ""Nkhondo"", a noticeable shift away from the explosive beats and bright glare of synths that previous albums made their trademark.</p>
<p>That humble sound carries over to ""Hear Me"", Karlberg’s programmed beat and somber piano chords set somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/838-music-has-the-right-to-children/""><i>Music Has the Right to Children</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a>’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_%28album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Dummy</i></a>: slow, filtered, and at a shuffling pace. There’s the chant of a Malawian choir, some staticky voices lifted from the radio, and above it all, Mwamwaya’s strong yet controlled voice, elegant as a cloud drifting across the track. His voice interacts with that choir again on the unadorned chants of ""Bilimankhwe"", sounding like something Smithsonian-Folkways (or Hugh Tracey) might have captured to tape in the 1950s. The clean guitar that carries the ballad ""Mwana Wanga"" finds the group at its most hushed and appealing.</p>
<p>From there though, that unassuming yet new wrinkle to the Very Best’s sound gets pushed to the side by more club-friendly fare, and the results are not nearly as charming as the first half. The break that comes three minutes into ""Sweka"" is an ambient oasis of wordless vocals and electronic trickles, but on either side is a generic chicken-scratch guitar and filtered thump. Where the duo’s ability to wed political African lyricism to production that might smuggle it into a DJ set once played to their strong suit, now when the chintzy synth chords and Ibiza-acceptable thump of ""Mariana"" lurch to the fore, it sounds like shameless pandering. There’s moments where the Very Best show that rather than merely parlay exuberance and global harmony, they can also manage the somber aspect of their music. But when Karlberg slows the beat to a crawl again on ""The Dead and the Dreaming"", he also sullies the clear timbre of Mwamwaya’s voice with distortion.

Anyone familiar with the Bay Area rapper’s work and has driven a car in summer with the windows down will appreciate the significance of this event. Roach’s track record with delivering effectively primordial, trunk-rattling post-hyphy rap music has been consistent since he first gained national attention with his mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14419-roachy-balboa/""><i>Roachy Balboa</i></a> in 2010. The title fit the music’s contentious charm: Roach’s hyperactive approach seemed to be a means of proving himself against naysayers, as well as a reflection of his influences, including noted hometown syllable-crammers from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"">E-40</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5867-keak-da-sneak/"">Keak da Sneak</a>. Like his first retail release—2012’s <i>Bugged Out—</i>Roach’s new studio album is centered around tight, single-ready songwriting and slicker, more flourish-filled production. But <i>The Float</i> is a much more significant stylistic departure, which finds the rapper venturing well outside of his comfort zone both lyrically and musically.</p>
<p>Appropriately, the album is framed like a dream vacation, bookended by loudspeaker chatter on an airplane to Hawaii during<b> </b>ascent and descent. Roach’s writing is unusually introspective and tranquil: He dabbles in loose, pseudo-philosophical ruminations, ones that might surface while lounging (a bit faded) on a beach at sundown. One of the touchstones of a Roach release is the proverbial fire-spitting cut; tracks of <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQyCkwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJ6-F4NKGSz0&amp;ei=2K82VeL-OfDbsASh5IGYBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNExeT09Jg9iWZWjW2Qx4_c9myAQ_w&amp;sig2=9Iv9mC1GMEMyvKN4ev21HA&amp;bvm=bv.91071109,d.b2w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=208zbUoQcas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">type</a> constitute a large fraction of his output, sometimes leaving him breathless and ready for the James Brown cape-drape. But Roach cuts back on that overstuffed style on <i>The Float</i>—compartmentalizing his verses and maintaining an unflappable cool.</p>
<p>Writing more painstakingly, however, steers him away from the jester role he’s played so well in the past; you have to wait four tracks for the first quintessential Roach-ism, and by that point it sticks out like a sore thumb: ""A couple likes don’t up amounts in your bank account/ And in this climate, I’m the Heimlich/ Don’t fuck with me, or you could choke on vomit."" Taunts and lecherous punchlines are frequently subbed out in favor of self-help truisms and some moments of wide-angle paranoia, the dark side of the high. Lyrically, there’s nothing cringe-worthy on this album (that’s not something Roach seems capable of), but it’s hard not to wish he’d incorporated a few more firebrand moments.</p>
<p>But the much more noticeably atypical element of the album is its production. In the past, Roach’s songs have been grounded by bare, stuttering kick drums, handclaps, wobbly synth leads, and not much else. But on <i>The Float</i>, Roach’s producers (including long-time collaborator C-Loz) infuse that unmistakably West Coast architecture with gestures from rock, soul, and house. The impulse to diversify is reasonable considering how long Roach has stayed the course with that sound, but since it’s his first major step away, the results are variegated in quality. The most puzzling moment is a re-pitched interpolation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR3Vdo5etCQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Doubt’s ""Don’t Speak""</a> as minimalist techno; it’s made stranger by the fact that Roach raps for only 45 seconds of its three-and-a-half minutes. Other lukewarm moments include ""Hippy"", which employs an overdriven rock aesthetic, and the practiced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a>-esque swagger and come-on R&amp;B hook of ""Drunk With You"". Unfortunately, Roach doesn’t pack enough lyrical punches in these songs to improve their replay value.</p>
<p>The best tracks walk the line between the flashy, battle-rapping Roach of old and his more enlightened upgrade. Opener ""Mob Right Thru"" is one of his best singles to date, grounded by a glossy slide-guitar-like riff and spare beat which leaves Roach space to duck and weave. ""No End in Sight"" is equally understated, a piece of pleasantly harmonized underwater disco which features Roach’s best lines on the tape: He juxtaposes vaunting wisecracks with evocative autobiographical details, even a brief aside to his son. These postulate a future Roach capable of both embracing a more mature, restrained sound while still playing to his strengths.</p>
<p>It’s never felt like Roach needed to change his formula. He has almost an excess of personality, and finds ways to vary his results and build excitement over anything he’s rapping over—if he tackled over the same beat four times on a tape, you might not be able to tell, and you probably wouldn’t care. But all good things must come to an end, even if it’s only for his sake. If <i>The Float </i>is not the crossover some fans might hope for (it always seemed like Roach should be more popular than he is), it at least provides evidence that Roach is thinking critically about his future, pulling parts of his sound apart and rebuilding them in creative ways. ""Even when I’m bad, I’m great,"" he raps on ""Bounce Back""; this rule, in some sense, has held for five years, and it seems unlikely that it will change anytime soon.</p></div>"|20528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20528-the-float/|6.8|Winston Cook-Wilson

Despite their intentions, though, they wind up seeming <i>too</i> free, and their first full-length <i>Transient</i>, while an intriguing listen with moments of promise, suffers from a lack of direction that squanders their potential.</p>
<p>Even the most <i>outre</i> metal groups have some sort of defined mission. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32192-impetuous-ritual/"">Impetuous Ritual</a> are committed to building seemingly endless oppressive walls of death-metal noise; post-<i>Obscura</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31518-gorguts/"">Gorguts</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2394-kayo-dot"">Kayo Dot</a> seek to bridge the gap between metal and modern classical; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32767-mastery/"">Mastery</a> shows how utter chaos can be carefully spliced and reconfigured for maximum impact. Chaos Echoes' aims on <i>Transient</i> are more difficult to pin down. Opening track ""Senses of the Nonexistent"" thuds on and on for nine-plus minutes; cut in half, it would be twice as compelling. The song's length doesn't seem to serve any larger purpose; it just traps them (and us) in purgatory.  ""Interzone IV: Intoxicating Beauty"", the following track, contines in the same vein. It's not until two minutes into ""Advent of My Genesis"", the third track, that Chaos offer any catharsis. Their tone, on the breakdown, evokes the howling walls of the aforementioned Impetuous Ritual, or their sister band Grave Upheaval, forced screeching and wailing into sunlight. The brightness works, contrasting murk with airiness. </p>
<p>""Genesis"" shows, again, their map-burning working against them. Considering that drummer Ilmar is one of the founding members, one would expect the band to sync with him, but much of ""Genesis"" sounds as though he's going rogue, his rolls ignoring the tension being built by the guitars. (Considering how often they struggle with plodding on <i>Transient</i>, maybe they need to stop by Paris and visit experimental American ex-pat <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6260-stephen-omalley/"">Stephen O'Malley</a>.) There's a fine line between looseness and simply not knowing what the hell is going on, and ""Genesis"" communicates more of the latter than the former. </p>
<p>Intriguingly, Chaos Echoes' more (relatively) conventional moments are, more often than not, their strongest. The black metal surge on the latter half of ""Genesis"" connects powerfully. ""Kyôrakushugi"" further expands on their black metal side, and it's one of their most defined tracks. Even when the rest of the band vaporizes into a mist of plucks and groans, Ilmar keeps on blasting, giving momentum they sorely need. ""<span>Interzone VI: Realization”, meanwhile, combines drones too understated for their own good with an unfocused half-moan, half-growl vocal,</span> like a bad <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a> outtake. </p>
<p>""Soul Ruiner"" suggests a midpoint between their ambitions and their grasp. Staring out with frenzied picking with a slightly no-wave inflection, the band finally achieves that ""free death metal"" sound. Hallowed solos and ghostly runs sound disembodied while still leaning forward. Is this what they were wanting to go for the whole time? <i>Transient</i> takes too long to find any pulse, but ""Ruiner"" provides a molecule of closure for a confusing album.</p>
<p>There should be more metal bands like Chaos Echoes, ones that challenge the notions of what metal is and what it can be. But even experiments need purpose and direction. On their Bandcamp page, there's a Wayne Shorter quote: ""To hell with the rules, I am going for the unknown."" Chaos Echoes heeded this advice and dove headfirst, but on <i>Transient</i>, they don't make it back. Who knows how they will expand, contract, or mutate in the future; for now, the idea of Chaos Echoes exceeds that of their execution.</p></div>"|20496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20496-transient/|6.1|Andy O'Connor

It’s easy to take for granted now, but Michael Angelakos’ first two records shifted the pop paradigm in meaningful ways. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13169-manners/""><i>Manners</i></a> hooked up the '80s synth-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11406-saturdaysyouth/""><i>Saturdays=Youth</i></a> to a glucose IV, piling on children’s choirs and waves of orchestration and Angelakos’ signature falsetto until it forced you into submission; three years later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16844-gossamer/""><i>Gossamer</i></a> ramped up the density, scale, and emotional rawness of Angelakos’ writing, as he built glittering castles around love, death, and the redeeming power of joy. That rawness is what separates Passion Pit from its lesser contemporaries, and from bands who would seek to duplicate their success: Angelakos' songs dance on the line between sweet and saccharine, but they’re anchored by real stakes. They’re full of light because you can use a lot of it when you’re holding a candle to the darkness.</p>
<p><i>Kindred</i> is Angelakos’ first record after conducting an unflinching, very public self-examination of his mental health and its effects on his life and loved ones, a process that dominated both <i>Gossamer</i> and the press cycle around the record. Instead of doubling down on that kind of reflection, Angelakos shifts focus to the parts of his life that gave him strength as he endured personal and professional turmoil: his family, his faith, and the radiant love that springs from both. It’s also his most concise record to date, a far cry from the sprawl of both <i>Manners</i> and <i>Gossamer</i>: it’s only 10 songs, and the songs themselves are more interested in speed and economy.</p>
<p>The best songs are the ones that really take that idea of efficiency to heart, stripping away fluff and frippery to focus on core melodic ideas or compositional concepts. This marks a major change in Angelakos’ songwriting: most listeners would agree that <i>Gossamer</i>’s best moments were its biggest, whether the frenzied <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a>-isms of ""I’ll Be Alright"" or the massive, starlit ""Hideaway"". That’s not the case here on <i>Kindred</i>, where the highlights hew closer to the soulful heartbreaker ""Constant Conversations"". There are a lot of moving parts on something like ""Whole Life Story"", a song-length apology to Angelakos’ wife for the scrutiny placed on their lives post-<i>Gossamer</i>, but each of them are clear and discernible rather than overwhelming, and lithe pop-funk jam ""Where the Sky Hangs"" sets a new record for ""audible space in a Passion Pit song.""</p>
<p>When Angelakos opts for an arrangement that recalls the density of his older work, you find yourself wishing he had opted for a similarly pared down approach. ""All I Want"" is a good example. Its core message—being struck dizzy and dumb by your love for someone, and rejoicing in it with a simple, gorgeous melody—is compromised by the use of every tool in Angelakos’ toolbox: whirring dervishes spat out on guitar, vocal pieces whispering like ghosts in the background, glittering doodads glued on like rhinestones. On earlier albums, the tremendous scale and layering of his songs felt purposeful, like it was meant to reflect the buzzing hornets’ nest in Angelakos’ brain; when he tries to do the same thing on <i>Kindred</i> it feels aimless, a choice that doesn’t move songs forward or help to advance any ideas.</p>
<p>This is also a very spiritual record, which shouldn't be a surprise if you've pored over Angelakos' lyric sheets before. (Consider <i>Gossamer</i> closer ""Where We Belong"", where after alluding to a suicide attempt Angelakos sings, ""Who says that God exists?/ We can't see icons or myths, but/ Well, I believe in you/ Do you believe in me, too?"") Opener ""Lifted Up (1985)"" is another glowing ode to Angelakos' wife, but it traffics in the language of apotheosis: Instead of being born, she descends from heaven, and when she threatens to float back Angelakos grounds her with the force of their love. The album is otherwise scattered with references to prayer and the exertion of subtle divine force, like the conspicuous cloud cover of ""Looks Like Rain"" and the baptism/savior imagery of ""My Brother Taught Me How to Swim"". This kind of writing isn't as obviously courageous as the work he did on <i>Gossamer</i>, but it still takes plenty of bravery to write frankly about faith in a medium where it's usually ignored or neglected. It takes guts to say, in effect, ""I had to work really hard to get better, and embracing something bigger than myself really helped me."" And while Angelakos has never been a particularly artful lyricist, he writes with a wide-eyed sincerity and frankness that makes you want to root for him.</p>
<p>As the first document of Angelakos' shift towards a different songwriting approach, one more focused on efficiency and pop purity than complexity or breadth, <i>Kindred</i> is ultimately both a transitional moment and a mixed bag. Not every song on <i>Manners</i> and <i>Gossamer</i> worked, but at their very least they had something to keep your attention, some grippy sonic piece. <i>Kindred</i> lives and dies on the strength of its melodies, and some of those melodies are submarined by excess rather than enhanced by it. When the album's highlights click (""Whole Life Story"", ""Where the Sky Hangs"", ""Looks Like Rain"") they're as powerful and resonant as anything in the band's discography, but the chances of success feel a little lower than they were before.</p>
<p>It turns out that the year's best Passion Pit song, and the one that realizes the full potential of Angelakos' new ambitions, isn't even on <i>Kindred</i>. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC_Ya4cY8RQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pay No Mind""</a>, a single from Madeon's excellent March debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20379-adventure/""><i>Adventure</i></a>, is the kind of the song that couldn't exist without Passion Pit in the first place<span>—</span>a colorful fusion of pop, funk, and EDM featuring a typically chirpy vocal performance from Angelakos. His connection to the song's lyrics is obvious, a fraternal twin of ""Whole Life Story"" that finds Angelakos asking for forgiveness and encouraging his loved ones to ignore the external forces swirling around them. It's catchy without relying on gimmickry, undeniably personal, and totally piercing; it's the kind of song I'd love to find more often on <i>Kindred</i>.</p></div>"|20454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20454-kindred/|6.8|Jamieson Cox

But Sherwood made his deepest mark 30-some years ago, working in the slipstream between post-punk, industrial and Jamaican music that ran between London and New York. Once you start picking at the threads of his CV, you'll discover an adventurous, refined musical talent whose singular sound helped generate momentum for a slew of edgy, iconic bands and ensured his own placement in the producers' pantheon.</p>
<p>To stimulate the inevitable reassessment, Sherwood is releasing music from his back catalog on his On-U Sound label, which he originally founded in 1979 as a repository for the work he was doing with Jamaican musicians. <i>Sherwood at the Controls, Vol. I: 1979-1984</i> explores a thrilling period in music history and makes a compelling point of entry for appreciating Sherwood's influence. Among its 14 selections, dub is a persistent thread. In the London music scene of the late '70s, the sonic touchstones of Jamaican music—oceanic bass, cavernous reverb, spacious syncopation, an overarching sense of studio-applied patience and distance—appeared in surprising places, applied to far-flung genres.</p>
<p>By that stage in his career, young Sherwood had cultivated a reputation beyond his early association with Jamaican expats in London's reggae scene. He was known as a production auteur with a serious ear and bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">the Slits</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group/"">the Pop Group</a>, all represented here in various incarnations, sought his signature touch. On the Fall's ""Middle Mass"", they sound like a more minimalist version of themselves, demonstrating both Sherwood's collaborative subtlety and Mark E. Smith's predilection for bubbling bass. The Pop Group frontman Mark Stewart's ""Learning to Cope with Cowardice"" is one of the more contemporary-sounding jams here, the kind of crunchy digi-dub that we associate from modern purveyors like Glasgow's <a href=""http://scotchbonnet.net/shop/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scotch Bonnet Records</a> or Leipzig's <a href=""http://jahtari.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jahtari</a>.</p>
<p>Stewart wasn't the only Pop Group member to enlist Sherwood after the band's breakup: Guitarist John Waddington recorded with him as part of a group called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2988-maximum-joy/"">Maximum Joy</a>. ""Let It Take You There"" is one of the comp's highlights, six minutes of spaced-out and infectiously upbeat post-punk funk à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7812-esg/"">ESG</a>. It follows album opener ""Hungry, So Angry"" by Medium Medium—another fantastic, dancefloor-oriented, sax-driven number, this one leaning toward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a>-like jitter-pop. Several songs later, Sherwood and Shriekback—which consisted of Barry Andrews of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4685-xtc/"">XTC</a> and Dave Allen of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a>—push the limits of a LinnDrum machine on the proto-industrial ""Mistah Linn He Head"".</p>
<p>If you sense a theme, that's not an accident: These songs and artists form a nexus of references for a slew of more recognizable early '80s bands. Sherwood was a physical link between the Jamaican underground to the white avant-garde, and collectively, over the course of years, they pushed unconventional musical ideas into the mainstream, where the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7099-the-police/"">the Police</a> made them popular.</p>
<p>But Sherwood—and <i>Sherwood at the Controls</i>—remains unpopulist. The second half of the compilation is especially and deliciously weird. Here we meet Jamaican music luminaries like producer Prince Far I, whose Linton Kwesi Johnson-sampling ""Nuclear Weapon"" flows at a lava-like pace, and vocalist Bim Sherman, who performs ""Reaching the Bad Man"" as part of Sherwood's studio ensemble Singers and Players, unspooling an eight-minute foray into deep, skeletal dub. To this day, African Head Charge is one of On-U's flagship bands; their 1982 cut ""In a Trap"" sizzles with Nyabinghi-style percussion, rubbery bass and faraway guitar.</p>
<p>The depth and breadth of <i>Sherwood at the Controls</i> stuns. These songs aren't just curious footnotes in one man's extensive discography—a bunch of them legitimately bang, and the ones that don't go full-bore into left field. Taken together, they give a sense of the indelible mark Sherwood has left, and hopefully there is more on the way to round out the picture.  </p></div>"|20535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20535-sherwood-at-the-controls-vol-1-1979-1984/|8.0|Jonathan Zwickel

It’s one of the most striking moments on <i>Edge of the Sun</i>, a rusty tangle of staccato notes and syncopation atop a sinewy percussion groove. Not only does it chafe against the band’s default folk rock, but that central riff acts as a sort of code, as though the Tucson collective is offering coordinates for a northerly route connecting South and North, Sonora with San Francisco.</p>
<p>It’s a song about origins (""¿De dónde eres?"") and destinations (""¿Adónde vas?""), punctuated by the dots and dashes of a conspiratorial horn section. ""I’m not from here, I’m not from there,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7335-joey-burns/"">Joey Burns</a> sings, imbuing this itinerancy with power and possibility. Taking over vocals at the bridge, the Spanish vocalist Amparo Sánchez reveals the song’s true destination. ¿Adónde vas? ""A bailer cumbia."" In this as in so many of Calexico’s songs, the characters can go anywhere and do anything. Perhaps it’s a quaint notion, but there is a certain freedom in rootlessness and restlessness.</p>
<p>This idea has been Calexico’s guiding principle since Burns and drummer Jon Convertino split from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1713-giant-sand/"">Giant Sand</a> in the early 1990s and lit out for parts unknown. They have never stood still for long, working as a backing band for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case/"">Neko Case</a> and Amos Lee while expanding their drums-and-guitar soundtrack rock into something larger, more song-driven, and more cinematic. If the band have skirted accusations of cultural appropriation, that’s mainly due to the important fact that they do not deploy world music as a means to exoticize American folk rock. Rather, these various strains form the framework of their band’s songs, all the way down to the lyrics themselves. It wasn’t until 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17033-algiers/"">Algiers</a></i> that they began to sound creatively staid, as though they had reached the ends of their inspiration in Latin American music, but <i>Edge of the Sun</i> sounds newly invigorated and inspired as Calexico reconsider their own past and find new music to explore.</p>
<p>Burns and Convertino have always surrounded themselves with an eclectic set of collaborators, and <i>Edge of the Sun</i> is filled with cameos, most of them lending their songs a distinctive sound. Case sounds like a mirage on ""Tapping on the Line"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6993-ben-bridwell/"">Ben Bridwell</a>, on loan from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/632-band-of-horses/"">Band of Horses</a>, adds some 2000s indie-rock drama to opener ""Falling from the Sky"", making that central question resonate powerfully throughout the rest of the album: ""Where do you go when you have nowhere to go?"" With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7207-sam-beam/"">Sam Beam</a> singing and playing guitar, ""Bullets &amp; Rocks"" inevitably recalls their joint EP from 2005, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4129-in-the-reins-ep/"">In the Reins</a></i>, only bolder and more resourceful as they set a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5199-tinariwen/"">Tinariwen</a> guitar lick rolling through the Mojave.</p>
<p><span>As usual, however, the most compelling contributions come from artists less familiar to American ears. For this reason, Calexico place them prominently in the music, often building whole songs around their voices or instruments. Sánchez is as much a presence on ""Cumbia de Donde"" as frontman Burns is, and members of the Greek band Tikam lend ""World Undone"" its suspense, creating the impression of an unraveling groove. Mexican singer Carla Morrison dominates the dark reggae bump of ""Moon Never Rises"", ghosting Burns’ vocals before distorting her own delivery to make that central theme sound unsettling, uprooted, unplaceable. (Curious listeners should check out her excellent 2012 album, </span><i><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/4Rc3wOCoh4jpWkNzum6dDA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Déjenme Llorar</a>.)</i></p>
<p>It’s tempting to praise Calexico simply for its globetrotting spirit, but corralling so many styles and sounds onto one album should not be an end in itself. Fortunately, the album’s musical diversity is a reflection of its lyrical themes. Named for a city that straddles Mexico and America, Calexico make music that is almost inevitably about borders both musical and national: finding them, crossing them, blurring them. Burns’ songwriting keeps that idea anchored in very personal and specific perspectives, which lends human proportions to the ambitiously cinematic arrangements. His characters are transient by circumstance, always striving for something better: a sense of security, a feeling of freedom, a place to dance without danger, sometimes just a dip in the ocean.</p>
<p>That’s the one wish of the main character in ""Miles from the Sea"", a landlocked laborer beaten down by ""years of searing heat."" He ""dreams about swimming, miles away from the sea,"" Burns sings, his voice reaching deep to hit the low notes. The horns billow gently, the violin eddies wistfully, and Guatemalan singer Gaby Moreno draws those syllables out on the chorus to reinforce the sense of longing. The song fades in a roll of thunder, hinting that this dream of escape will go unrealized, but the music takes him and us right out among the waves. </p></div>"|20353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20353-edge-of-the-sun/|7.6|Stephen M.

From post-punk to hardcore to metal and beyond, there have always been active, overlapping house show/small club scenes in D.C. that owe their basic ethos to punk. The bands on the recently released and truly exciting <a href=""theredlinecomp.bandcamp.com""><i>Red Line Comp</i></a>, declaring themselves the ""New Wave of D.C. Hardcore,"" shift the spotlight from historical D.C. punk to what’s happening now, and so far, both the comp and the other releases of the bands it features have proven that you should, indeed, pay attention to what this crew is up to. They’re not releasing grab-you-by-the-collar records, they’re releasing grab-you-by-the-throat records.</p>
<p>Red Death, one of the bands featured on <i>The Red Line Comp</i>, step up, demanding their place in this stellar still-forming legacy with <i>Permanent Exile</i>, their first full-length. Members who contributed to this album play in more traditional hardcore bands like Sectarian Violence, but <i>Permanent Exile</i> is a full-on crossover thrash record, less in the speedier L.A. tradition (think Cryptic Slaughter) than in the heavier New York tradition (think D.R.I.). The band roars, gnashes, howls, and divebombs its way through 16 minutes and 47 seconds, and when it’s over, the listener is left with the kind of bone-tired exhilaration that follows the best hardcore shows—if you’ve ever sat on the stoop with your friends after an incredible set, soaked in sweat with glowing cheeks, too tired to speak much but with new determination to start a band of your own, you know the feeling.</p>
<p><i>Permanent Exile</i> never feels relentless or too formulaic, two easy traps for hardcore and metal records to fall into. There are thousands of mundane releases out there that in under 20 minutes can cause a listener’s eyes to glaze over—what song is this one again? It sounds exactly the same as the last three. With taut, well-written songs that vary in tempo and even stray into noise-ambience in places (""Atomic Howl""), Red Death expertly avoid these pitfalls. The record blazes the whole way through, but the fire flickers in different patterns—the difference between a pretty good record and a great one.</p>
<p>My one small quibble with <i>Permanent Exile</i> is the mix, and this is really a matter of taste; I tend to prefer a more layered hardcore-style mix in which the bass and guitar are slightly disentangled and the vocals just under the surface rather than a more metal-style mix in which the bass and guitar lay thick in the middle and the vocals sit directly on top. There are plenty of records from the original crossover thrash mini-boom of the mid-'80s that are mixed exactly like this one, so it’s not that it’s not the right sound for the subgenre. It’s just that crossover thrash is a continuum, and I tend to prefer recordings that lay closer to the set of hardcore production aesthetics than the metal ones.</p>
<p>Whatever your particular sonic subgenre production style allegiance is, though, there’s no denying that this is an excellent record with enough crushing riffs, precise but powerful drumming, and spot-on vocals that are a perfect homage without being a parody, to make even the oldest, crabbiest scene vet sit up and take notice.</p></div>"|20500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20500-permanent-exile/|7.5|Jes Skolnik

A single bass frequency pulses for a full eight bars before a voice croons from the dark: ""I can’t be sure of it."" Its echo follows close behind, and then its echo’s echo, twinning around each other, filling the grotto (complete with dripping noises) like waves at high tide. The track, ""Can’t Be Sure"", is the embodiment of what Tei Shi calls ""mermaid music,"" and an intermittent heartbeat suggests that the ""it"" the voice sings of is likely a matter of the heart. The song, like the rest of the EP, explores the exposed, liminal spaces: between certainty and uncertainty, desire and apathy, wanting and needing.</p>
<p>Tei Shi is the moniker of New York City-based singer/songwriter and producer Valerie Teicher. She released her first EP, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/tei-shi/sets/saudade"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Saudade</i></a>, in 2013 with collaborator and producer Luca (who also helped produce <i>Verde</i>). The project introduced her to the world as a skilled and fluid vocalist, the kind who can create waves with nothing but her voice and loops. Born in Buenos Aires to Colombian parents, Teicher's family uprooted and moved to Canada and then she left for music school in Boston. ""When your environment changes so much around you, you have to make yourself the constant,"" she said in <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2014/08/tei-shi-no-angel/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 2014 interview with <i>Rookie</i></a>. Teicher's music shares some overlap with the dreamy, future soul/alt-R&amp;B sphere of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Kelela</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Tinashe</a>, and she also brings to mind the similarly water-obsessed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32780-rahel/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Rahel</a>, or an '80s-pop-leaning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32414-shura/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Shura</a>. But while her voice can fit anywhere she flexes it, she's still finding the best context for it.</p>
<p><i>Verde</i> is in one sense a series of experiments exploring how an artist maintains an individual voice across genres. The EP’s first single and second track, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A17rVbNTtrg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bassically""</a>, for instance, takes the form of a synthy '80s pop ballad. While the lyrics themselves fall a bit flat, Teicher sells them with her delivery, and over the course of a couple verses, she builds into some serious siren-level wails. ""Go Slow"", the pop gem of the EP, is a sweet, if guarded, invitation to get closer, with a groove that is part boom bap, part trap-lite, but swathed in electropop. ""See Me"", meanwhile, is a more direct line to Teicher’s indie roots. Atmospherically, it's kind of like a cross between the lushness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Bat for Lashes</a> and the minimalism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">the xx</a>. It works beautifully, but the xx guitars in particular sound a little too close to the original, and you sense that Teicher is still figuring out who she is as a producer.</p>
<p class=""p1"">She may still be coming into her own in that regard, but <i>Verde </i>glows with unmistakable and appealing confidence. On record, Teicher radiates a quiet self-possession, someone conscious of her desires and unafraid of vulnerability. There are a few possible directions mapped out on this EP, and hopefully whichever one she takes next, she’ll bring the same kind of magnetism and musical responsiveness with her.</p></div>"|20522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20522-verde-ep/|7.0|Minna Zhou

His last LP, 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13541-there-is-no-enemy/""><i>There Is No Enemy</i></a>, was quietly better and more focused than its two predecessors, but it didn’t get much attention from press or long-term fans. Martsch didn’t tour behind <i>Enemy</i> for three years, and when he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/overtones/9106-imperfect-from-now-on/"">spoke</a> to Pitchfork in 2013 he admitted to feeling directionless. ""It’s hard getting older, thinking maybe I’ve run my course,"" he said. In between then and now, another record was recorded and scrapped. </p>
<p>Built to Spill albums have themes, but they fit loosely, like the stretched-out tees and flannels Martsch wears onstage. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_from_Now_On"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Perfect from Now On</i></a> was cosmic; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_It_Like_a_Secret"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Keep It Like a Secret</i></a> explored miscommunication; <i>There Is No Enemy</i> seemed haunted by personal loss, unspecific but sharply painful. (""It doesn’t matter if you’re good or smart/ Goddamn it, things fall apart""). <i>Untethered Moon</i> also has a theme, and it’s one he spells out early: ""I found a place where I know I’ll always be tethered/ And I knew, when I woke up, rock and roll will be here forever,"" he sings on ""All Our Songs"". On the modest arc traced on <i>Moon</i>’s 10 songs, a diffident soul finds his faith restored and his soul lifted by the music he’s loved his whole life.</p>
<p>This is the point to note that if you’ve loved Built to Spill’s music <i>your</i> whole life, <i>Untethered Moon</i> will have this same comforting, classic feel. In the mid-'90s, as his band and his vision took form, Martsch was a restless tinkerer, one who would throw together different versions of his band each time out, and for a while you never quite knew what shape or size or tone Built to Spill albums would take. There was something thrilling about that, and since the band settled into its current sound around the turn of the millennium, I’ve never quite stopped missing it.</p>
<p>Still, the familiarity of Built to Spill is a balm, and hearing Martsch fiddle with his main melodic ideas is like visiting cousins: everyone’s older, no one’s much different, someone’s hair is longer or shorter, someone’s brought a different girlfriend. Martsch is still messing around with unexpected ways to fit together guitar rock songs—on ""All Our Songs"", everything drops out for him to play a little three-note figure surrounded by silence, and then he brings the band back in with a pedal stomp. ""Living Zoo"" works an extended lyrical metaphor (""Being a human/ Being an animal, too""), as the tempo quickens and drags, the guitars twirling overhead like multicolored kites.</p>
<p>There are new moments and darker colors here if you listen closely for them. ""On the Way"" feels like a song form Martsch has never tried, with female backup singers, a walking bass line, and a cloudy sense of menace. The loosely dub-inflected ""C.R.E.B."" (Martsch was threatening a Built to Spill reggae album for a while last decade) is pained and even a little bleak, a welcome reminder that there are shadowy spots in the bright open spaces of his music. ""I never meant to forget you/ I always forget people I really love/ If I haven’t seen them for a long time/ And I haven’t seen you for a long time,"" he sings, a moment where you can hear and feel some internalized regrets and emotions surface.</p>
<p>In general, the higher the emotional stakes, the better Martsch gets; you sense that he could jam out a passable Built to Spill album in a few weeks if he wanted to (and that’s exactly what it seemed like he did with 2001’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Melodies_of_the_Future"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ancient Melodies of the Future</i></a> and 2005’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1016-you-in-reverse/""><i>You In Reverse</i></a>). There is even some audible self-deprecation creeping into his song titles: On <i>There Is No Enemy</i>, he offered us ""another nowhere lullaby"" (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRNNeUw_cP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nowhere Lullaby""</a>) and on <i>Untethered Moon</i> he gives us ""All Our Songs"" and the shruggingly titled ""Some Other Song"". On ""Another Day"", he frets over ""an obsolescence no one would plan."" It sounds like a world-beating talent recognizing his own limitations, deciding whether or not to make something good or something great. There will always be flickers of the latter on Built to Spill’s albums, and if there are only four or five them here, they are bright enough to reassure that Martsch is probably not going anywhere, and that he’ll continue to grace us, every once in a while, with his unassuming, inscrutable presence.</p></div>"|20362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20362-untethered-moon/|7.1|Jayson Greene

Nearly 40 years into their career, Wire remain unpredictable, going through aesthetic phases, reincarnations, breakups, and re-assemblings while dealing with final departures and new members. Yet in spite of it all, they’re still <i>themselves</i>, somehow. With no clear model for being elder statesman in rock, there’s room to do whatever one wants. Given Wire’s long history, it must be tempting for them to create ""just"" another album. But there’s never been ""just"" another Wire album, really—their career has always produced as much brow-furrowing and head-scratching as immediate love. Then all those inclined end up loving it anyway, and then, another album.</p>
<p>Following 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17720-wire-change-becomes-us/""><i>Change Becomes Us</i></a>, which re-worked early 1980s song sketches into full songs, <i>Wire</i> feels at first almost strangely normal. Lewis is credited with most of the lyrics, Newman does most of the vocals in his gentler speak/sing mode, and the feeling generally is calmly inviting. Cryptic song titles have been replaced with more prosaic tags like ""In Manchester"", ""High"", ""Swallow""—even ""Blogging"", the name of the acoustic-led opener, at once moody, drily observational, and tense. Given that the term ""post-punk"" has reached a signifying-nothing-at-all stage (matching suits? a certain kind of haircut?), hearing a band who was actually there take their sound to a particular place few can truly reach is refreshing.</p>
<p>As lyrics like ""fucking by proxy…selling on eBay"" from ""Blogging"" show, Wire remain situated in a timeless retrofuture, simultaneously engaged and removed, which has always been their unique gift. The unease with the self, with the band as a fixed organizational point, that sense of relentless questioning and observation, continues. ""In Manchester"", for instance, could almost sound like something from early Factory Records days, except that the lyrics are about a song called ""In Manchester"" that has nothing to do with the place aside from that title. And it’s still a lovely singalong.</p>
<p>At points, you can hear Wire nodding to themselves, something not necessarily inevitable but still perfectly understandable—a guitar break on ""Shifting"" sounding like an echo from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11866-pink-flag-chairs-missing-154/""><i>Chairs Missing</i></a>, the brisk chug of ""Joust &amp; Jostle"" and the even more thrilling ""Split Your Ends"" show once again how they can create a clean, brisk, stop-and-start energy. They’re not just nodding to themselves, either—the rumbling slow punch of the album’s centerpiece track, ""Sleep-Walking"", calls to mind the feeling of tense dread from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QmqXoN_v8M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Comsat Angels’ ""Dark Parade""</a> off their early masterwork <i>Sleep No More</i>. But comparing Wire to another band never really works; nobody quite sounds like this.</p>
<p>Wire, forever the jokers, still never quite got their deserved deal out of the deck, and it won’t happen in the current fragmented musical landscape. They could have just said ""FINE"" and done a <i>154</i> album tour or the like for a lot more money and attention. A song here like ""Swallow"", perhaps the album’s most accessible-as-such number, the closest track to the platonic ideal of Wire’s pop song form, won’t even get the chance to <i>just</i> miss out on today’s equivalent to ""Top of the Pops"", whatever that might be. For those new to the band, Wire’s pleasures lie waiting, ready for those who want to take a chance on a daunting discography and a heck of a backstory that still keeps being added to. ""There’s always someone who thinks they’ve got a plan,"" sings Newman here on ""Octopus""; thank goodness for a band that had no plan but continues, as they choose, to succeed far more than many who did.</p></div>"|20472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20472-wire/|7.0|Ned Raggett

Reviews were almost comically awful. It could generously be described as a striking visual work that never really gels: Gosling’s time working with <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716347/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Winding Refn</a> on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Drive</i></a> clearly had a profound impact, as Christina Hendricks (who had a small role in Refn’s film) stars and the soundtrack is helmed by <a href=""http://italiansdoitbetter.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Italians Do It Better</a> label boss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30140-johnny-jewel/"">Johnny Jewel</a>, whose contributions to the <i>Drive</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"">soundtrack</a> helped establish the film's neon atmosphere. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32448-cliff-martinez/"">Cliff Martinez</a> technically handed the composer duties for <i>Drive</i>, but on the <i>Lost River</i> OST, Jewel gets his first real score, writing a soundtrack that runs excess of 90 minutes.</p>
<p>Jewel doesn’t really deal in concision, at least not in album form. His <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16148-themes-for-an-imaginary-film/""><i>Themes For an Imaginary Film</i></a>, released under the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30141-symmetry/"">Symmetry</a> guise, stretched to around two hours, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"">Chromatics</a>’ acclaimed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16452-kill-for-love/""><i>Kill for Love</i></a> clocks in at a similar length to this score, indulging in multifarious impulses along the way. Jewel's ease with writing frosted, clipped pop songs (Chromatics' ""Yes"", from this album, is a great example) provides a fascinating contrast to the way he approaches bigger works. Jewel might be trying to make his own <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusk_%28album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Tusk</i></a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screamadelica"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Screamadelica</i></a>, but he hasn't managed a consistent project yet, leaving behind a handful of works that sometimes fall on the wrong side of indulgence. He’s enviably talented, but with each passing album his lack of editing feels more like an Achilles heel.</p>
<p>The material on <i>Lost River</i> falls into three categories. There’s Jewel's familiar, heavily opiated glassy pop, represented by Chromatics, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27800-desire/"">Desire</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1728-glass-candy/"">Glass Candy</a>; a stretch of drifty, incidental film music; and moments culled directly from the cast of the film, including vocal turns by actors Red Kateb, Ben Mendelsohn (channeling his inner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a>), and former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3376-possum-dixon/"">Possum Dixon</a> frontman Rob Zabrecky. Jewel sequences these contrasting bits to make it sound like the music is emerging from a dream. Even the '50s R&amp;B of Billy Ward &amp; his Dominoes, included here in a brief interlude, sounds like it’s floating in from an abstract plane. Jewel finds unlikely common ground between his contemporary work, music for the ages, and drone-y instrumental pieces.</p>
<p>Again, though, Jewel's include-everything impulse works against him. Chromatics’ ""Yes"" is the standout, alternating between haunting and beautiful passages, perfectly strung across a tightrope of bliss and unease. But there’s no need for three versions of it to be included on the soundtrack, and the three versions of ""Deep Purple"" and two versions of ""Tell Me"" feel equally excessive. It’s a shame, because Saoirse Ronan's powerful version of ""Tell Me"" may have had more weight if it was just a standalone. Chromatics’ version of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Moon_(1934_song)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blue Moon""</a>, originally featured on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48468-listen-chromatics-share-35-minute-album-of-unreleased-material-from-kill-for-love-sessions/""><i>Running from the Sun</i></a> outtakes compilation, works precisely because it emerges from the gloom, strikes a chord, and never returns. </p>
<p>There’s a trove of solo Jewel compositions outside of the song-oriented tracks here, most of them leaning toward ambient and occasionally bringing to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>’s incidental film music. Shorn of context, there isn’t much to hold onto—a tough gap to bridge whenever film music is removed from its visual stimulus. The depth and breadth of this album makes it feel archival, as if someone excavated Jewel’s vaults for material long after the film was released—possibly an unfortunate downside of the exhaustive boom soundtracks have been undergoing in the past decade or so, where every last scrap of B-movie music warrants a $45 luxury vinyl release. This is a cut above the rest, but listening to it occasionally feels like sifting through a yard sale looking for gold.</p></div>"|20513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20513-lost-river-ost/|7.0|Nick Neyland

A backdrop of cello, church organ and piano gives way to a midtempo full-band rumble, and then Johannes Andersson grunts like a mad old man curling a finger and commanding you to come along. ""Beckoning the children of the night, the spirits of the undead and the lesser lights,"" he sings on ""Strange Gateways Beckon"". These first two minutes suggest the beginning of some grand adventure—a Tolkien-like walk through the woods, a Dante-like descent into depravity. And they are: A heavy metal record that wanders beyond any comfort zone, the hour-long <i>The Children of the Night</i> is a sprawling, compulsory tale that doesn’t turn dull.  </p>
<p>Tribulation have never made an album quite like this: More than a decade ago, most of the band played adolescent, hair-whipping trash as Hazard. Five years after a name change, they re-emerged with <i>The Horror</i>, a claustrophobic mixture of death metal, black metal and thrash, intertwined by arty interludes that suggested major ambition. They pursued it unapologetically and even to excess on 2013’s <i>The Formulas</i> <i>of Death, </i>which began with a tambura drone and ended with a shape-shifting 13-minute mess called ""Apparitions"".</p>
<p>On <i>The Children of the Night</i>, Tribulation push all those influences and ideas toward the center. It’s as if they’ve pondered the relatively populist successes of their fellow countrymen—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyQZ13jobIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost B.C.</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9lCXVFCs20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In Flames</a>, even <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH5RpH4xkEw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Watain</a>—and rediscovered the value of concision and motion. Psych rock and prog metal, thrash and classic rock commingle in three-to-seven-minute songs, bearing echoes of not just Mercyful Fate and At the Gates but Led Zeppelin and Hawkwind, the Doors and dub. Led by brilliant guitarists Jonathan Hultén and Adam Zaars, these ten incisive songs cut away tangents and bristle with urgency. “Holy Libations”  is heroic and surging, with one seeming crescendo and dashing solo piled atop another. The racing “Melancholia” powers through death metal before cresting with a rock-god solo that feels forever on the verge of falling apart.</p>
<p><span>By and large, though, it’s the band that makes these songs so stunning, not Andersson. He </span>sings in a perpetually gruff monotone, offering morose observations and dramatic revelations. During ""Holy Libations"", he delivers a dense verse about the solidarity of misery and then tries his best to break his typical pace with a sort of staccato half-rap. He stumbles around the beat, straining with effort. Tribulation, then, are a little like metal’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"">the Hold Steady</a>—a righteous rock band burnished by high-flying guitars and big keyboards but led by a singer who seems to have shown up late for practice with a notebook full of quips and a belly full of booze.</p>
<p>Tribulation let Andersson’s thorny vocals stand alone, backing him only occasionally with harmonies; for a band that composes with near-classical rigor, he remains the scratch that can’t be buffed. This tension becomes apparent when it disappears. Mid-album instrumental “Själaflykt” moves from doom-like dirge to mid-tempo boogie, like The Ventures penning a summertime special for the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. But by song’s end, the action feels bloated and defanged. When his growl bullies its way into “The Motherhood of God,” the friction is newly welcome.</p>
<p>Metal critics sometimes snipe at each other for preferring extreme or arty metal to the sort of music to which actually raise beers and fists. There is no way to arrive at a consensus artist who will satisfy everyone, of course, but <i>The Children of the Night</i> comes close. <span> On one hand, the irascible Andersson sounds like the kind of bandleader who hopes to follow you into an alley with a lead pipe. But the organ-loaded, solo-bejeweled “Strains of Horror” is an anthem. The hook of “Strange Gateways Beckon” just begs to be shouted back at the band. Sure, Andersson is a bit too brusque for complete crossover success, but the exceptional </span><i>The Children of the Night</i><span>extends an open invitation to a very wide audience.</span></p></div>"|20329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20329-the-children-of-the-night/|8.4|Grayson Haver Currin

Are you going to become a crusty <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_Thrower"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bolt Thrower</a> clone? Dare you get as filthy as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30082-autopsy/"">Autopsy</a>? Do you set to write tributes to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obituary_%28band%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Obituary</a>? These bands are all worth copying, but who says you have to choose just one? Canadian quintet Abyss, for one, don’t think you do. On their debut full-length, <i>Heretical Anatomy</i>, the group soaks in several styles of old-school death metal, overcoming the tyranny of influence to make an exciting tribute to the bands they love, while also offering up something of their own.</p>
<p>The opening title track splits the difference between two modes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31559-carcass/"">Carcass</a> worship; <i>Necroticism</i>’s refinement comes head to head with the rawness of <i>Symphonies of Sickness</i>. The track showcases Abyss’ penchant for borrowing from death metal’s legends, creating faithful renditions packed with their own punk personality. <i>Anatomy</i> has plenty of Nordic riffs, taken from the likes of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entombed_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Entombed</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30886-carnage/"">Carnage</a> and then dipped in dirtier, more American tar. The punk leanings really come through on the third track, ""Chained to Extinction"": a bulldozer bass segues into a palm-muted Swedish refrain so on-point you’ll envision waves of bobbing blonde hair before it all eventually explodes into thrashing catharsis. This release makes vocalist David Kristiansen exert himself more, going for an urgent hardcore yalp in line with the panicked rhythms.</p>
<p>""Flesh Cult"" is even more to the point, sounding like a death metal interpretation of Kristiansen’s main group, powerviolence band <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/2305912-Column-Of-Heaven"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Column of Heaven</a>. (It’s worth noting that he, along with CoH bassist Andrew Nolan and drummer Eric King, had a punky death metal group called Slaughter Strike between 2009 and 2011.) And, while it may seem like a strange quality for death metal, Abyss know when enough is enough. ""The Atonement"" flirts with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30858-incantation/"">Incantation</a>-style dirge, but the affair ends there. To exploit it would take away from <i>Anatomy</i>’s energy. ""Thrall of the Elder Gods"" is their slowest and longest, but it’s also a lesson in conservation. They’re able to drive the same terror from a cliffhanger riff as they do a full-on blastbeat-ridden assault.</p>
<p>Of all the influences, one is the most prominent: Flint, Michigan grindcore pioneers <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repulsion_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Repulsion</a>. Beneath their macabre obsessions and noisy racket, there was a rock'n'roll heart beating at the center of their sound. Abyss could be likened to Repulsion with a cut and a shave: the presentation may be a little cleaner, but the hunger doesn’t subside. Much of Repulsion’s youthful stride is found in how Abyss execute their riffs; there’s no joking around, but they still swing like Paul Speckmann and Chris Reifert just brought fresh kegs to the best death metal house party ever. You can hear that in the intro to ""Atonement"", where leads scamper around frantically, while remaining in sync with the rest of the band. Closer ""Nightmares in Skin"" also bears a heavy Repulsion branding, while maintaining some Swedish sickness.</p>
<p>While Abyss clearly bounce between styles, <i>Anatomy</i> resembles, in spirit, the formative days of death metal, where it hadn’t quite weaned itself off its thrash, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Discharge</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7759-motorhead/"">Motörhead</a>. Forms hadn’t jelled and folks hadn't gotten too serious just yet. Strange as it may sound, <i>Anatomy</i> is one of the most flat-out fun death metal records to come out in some time. It doesn’t strain and break its neck to be ""funny,"" it’s just an unpretentious but still interesting collection from a fresh new face.</p></div>"|20480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20480-heretical-anatomy/|7.5|Andy O'Connor

Now, she's wielding it like a weapon. <i>Foil Deer</i><span>, the Massachusetts <span>indie rock traditionalists' sophomore full-length</span>, </span>opens with Dupuis noting on ""Good Neck"" that she's good with a knife and she knows when to use it. She takes a lap around the block to cool down—like all good bosses should—before coming back with a world-beating declaration of autonomy on “Raising the Skate”: “I'm chief, not the overthrown/ Captain, not a crony/So if you wanna row, you better have an awfully big boat.”</p>
<p>With <i>Foil Deer</i>, Dupuis doesn't scold; she warns. The album is ferocious and visceral, the lyrics gleaming with threats involving sharp blades both literal and figurative (""Don't ever touch my blade, you fool/ You'll be cursed for a lifetime,"" she taunts knowingly on ""Dot X""). As Dupuis grows more self-possessed, she and her bandmates veer into their most ambitious compositions to date. Knotty melodies shift gears in an instant, giving <i>Foil Deer </i>a jumpy, enthralling energy. God bless ‘em, Speedy believe that every song ideally should have three or four musical ideas.</p>
<p>For its first 47 seconds, ""Zig"" scans like vintage folk-pop until the song abruptly steers into a thorny chunk of dissonance led by Dupuis’ contrasting falsetto. A minute passes and it sounds like yet another song—a much more melodic thing this time—before a nightmarish jumble of riffs and cymbals grinds the pace to a halt. A defeated Dupuis wonders aloud ""How many laps does it take to decide you’re back at the start?"" as she and her bandmates double back on the the song’s original theme. It’s a clever construction, representing just how much thought went into crafting each of these songs.</p>
<p>In Speedy Ortiz, both the music and lyrics work overtime, bringing a surplus of conflicting ideas to the table that they somehow manage to cram into tight spaces. The magic is that they never sound overworked, and in fact when they go more straighforward—""Puffer"", for instance, in which they try the pleather sleaze of '90s industrial rock on for size—it feels like not quite enough by comparison. Despite its clever kiss-offs (""Take me off your list or elect a lobotomy""), the chipper pop-punk of ""Swell Content"" would have sufficed on last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18935-speedy-ortiz-real-hair-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Real Hair </i>EP</a>, but here it feels like filler. It goes to show that the members of Speedy Ortiz can barely keep up with their own progress.</p>
<p>Dupuis, a recent MFA candidate in poetry at UMass Amherst, is among the most talented lyricists of her musical class. She writes vivid-yet-mysterious scenes that require interpretive work on the listeners' behalf<span>—</span>such as ""My Dead Girl"", a cryptic tale about living fast and risking becoming a missing face on a milk carton. But Dupuis’ greatest strength as a lyricist is her ability to turn her sour experiences into anthems about <b></b>clawing back from self-doubt. On <i>Foil Deer</i>, Dupuis makes standing up for yourself<span>—</span>in the face of double standards, struggles with addiction, and the general carelessness of youth<span>—</span>sound like a no-brainer, but she also never tries to hide how complicated everything can be. As the band continues to evolve around and with her, Speedy Ortiz’s music finally sounds as complex as its leader dares to be.</p></div>"|20351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20351-foil-deer/|7.9|Jillian Mapes

I mean this not in the sense that he is prolific (though he is), but that with each new release, he tweaks his sound, experimenting with new textures, technologies or conceptual limitations. Fairweather fans who lose track of his movements for awhile are usually surprised, in one way or another, when they return to sample whatever he’s working on. A new Squarepusher album is usually repelling, intriguing (possibly more in theory than practice) or captivating; more often, it's a little of all three.</p>
<p>On <i>Damogen Furies</i>, his first solo LP in three years, Jenkinson is in (the Squarepusher version of) pop mode. He grounds his unrelentingly brittle, electronic compositions with catchy synth melodies. Though his customary warp-speed drum loops still run off the rails, he relegates them to the role of accompaniment. Dynamics are largely dispensed with—the range is loud to extremely loud. It’s an approach he prototyped on his last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16608-ufabulum/""><i>Ufabulum</i></a>. For live shows around that time, he adopted a new, flashy stage act, donning a Boba Fett-like LED helmet, and incorporating a complex light show of blinding flashing matrices dancing around his podium. Suddenly, like the<a href=""http://www.theshovel.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/daft-wiggles.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> great</a> <a href=""http://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/deadmau5-rukes.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">masked</a> dance music connoisseurs of today, he became no longer just a guy with a laptop— he was suddenly, perhaps, someone capable of bigger, more <i>zeitgeist</i>-riding things.</p>
<p><i>Damogen Furies</i> is less subtle and funky than <i>Ufabulum</i>, but it’s more focused. Here, Jenkinson commits to one primary thematic idea per song, and develops and interrupts it within the bounds of a clear larger structure. Tracks like opener ""Stor Eiglass"" and ""Exjag Nives"" introduce pleasant, <i>portamento</i> synth melodies that develop cleverly, spaced out with breakbeat and boiled wah-bass interludes. Tracks like these are the closest Squarepusher has gotten to festival-ready EDM.</p>
<p>But he pushes against these sometimes-generic breakbeats, in his perverse way, tossing in conflicting elements and then rending everything apart into errant bits of space trash, like a child building a LEGO castle and then hurling his blocks in the air. ""Rayc Fire 2"" is a good (and non-anxiety-inducing) example: Beginning with a mechanistic, mid-tempo groove and pointillistic melody, it becomes increasingly fragmented and fitful, interrupted by jazz fusion-informed flights of fancy. The similarly restless ""Kontenjaz"" breaks down into rhythmic semi-choas, its meter deteriorating in a way that has more to do with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman &amp; Prime Time</a> than <i>The Richard D. James Album</i>.</p>
<p>Moments like these get at what is most interesting about Squarepusher’s work. Even on an album as wholly electronic-sounding as <i>Damogen Furies</i>, Jenkinson's musicality remains organic and responsive. Rather than using technology to surpass the limitations of live acoustic instruments, he creates moments of human flexibility with it (see also his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19242-squarepusher-z-machines-music-for-robots/"">music for robot performers</a> from last year). It is this exploratory drive which has always made him notable, the the face behind his many musical masks.</p></div>"|20487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20487-damogen-furies/|7.3|Winston Cook-Wilson

It all sounds quite a lot like the backstory of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9992-dave-longstreth"">Dave Longstreth</a>, and his music sounds even <i>more</i> like Longstreth’s: San Fermin’s breakout single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15457-san-fermin-sonsick/"">""Sonsick""</a> was essentially the Broadway version of ""Stillness Is the Move"", and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18500-san-fermin-san-fermin/"">resultant record</a> followed suit with highbrow, heavily orchestrated chamber indie with literary aspirations. Ludwig-Leone remains the project’s primary songwriter, composer, arranger and lyricist, but he takes the focus off himself for <i>Jackrabbit</i>, presenting San Fermin as a legit, eight-person touring band. Once again, the experience is more likely to make you think of other indie A-listers rather than San Fermin. </p>
<p>This was mostly true of <i>San Fermin</i> as well, though it had a debut’s charm. Ludwig-Leone had chops and taste; perhaps a distinct point of view would emerge with experience and time. And besides, its unwieldy ambitions were welcome at a time when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists/"">the Decemberists</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors"">Dirty Projectors</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens"">Sufjan Stevens</a> and others were laying low. But rather than building or expanding on his foundation, Ludwig-Leone just piles on and exaggerates: everything <i>San Fermin</i> did, <i>Jackrabbit</i> does twice as loud.</p>
<p>The vocals are still split almost equally between Charlene Kaye and Allen Tate and alternate on a song-by-song basis. But <i>San Fermin</i>’s storyline has been exchanged for generic signifiers. Narrators ""run for the hills"" on the title track, aspire for ""The Glory"", enter ""The Cave"", get lost in ""The Woods"",  and fall ""down, down, down the rabbit hole"" without much further elaboration. Kaye’s features are more enjoyable, especially when they take after ""Sonsick"": even if the elements are familiar, at least they’re combined in a novel way, and they allow you to indulge in some circa-2005 indie rock fantasy booking: What if Sufjan Stevens got a hold of Amber Coffman and put her at the forefront of his most bombastic<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7514-illinois/""><i> Illinois</i></a> orchestrations? That’s pretty much the pitch for ""Jackrabbit"" and ""Philosopher"", songs where Ludwig-Leone’s bold melodies and gushing orchestration have a vocalist who can keep up.</p>
<p>And at the very least, Kaye’s songs tend to evoke several bands at once. Allen Tate, however, has either never heard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national"">the National</a> or has never listened to any band other than the National. There’s no other way to explain the staggering degree to which Allen Tate sounds <i>exactly</i> like Matt Berninger. Not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen"">Leonard Cohen</a>, not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek"">Mark Kozelek</a>, or anyone else in the lineage of dour, baritone barstool bards. <i>Just Matt Berninger</i>. His vocals are subject to the same exact cadences, the exact melodic contours, the same wink-and-nod affectations, the same grim humor, the same vocabulary. When Tate takes the lead, San Fermin becomes the equivalent of a shaky music biopic, completely compromised by the uncanny valley effect of having someone not quite be the person he constantly reminds you of. The script, the setting, the soundtrack—all of it is rendered moot.</p>
<p>Worse yet, the melodramatic production on ""Emily"" and ""Woman in Red"" ensures they can't even pass as pleasant mimicry. The wearying volume of <i>Jackrabbit</i> is the most taxing aspect of a record that already arrives intentionally overstuffed. Ludwig-Leone has revealed himself to be a pop maximalist, as even the minute-long interludes are given to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTwgbwYTWdQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Backdraft</i></a>-like bursts of horns and strings. Maybe the guy's heart is truly in theater, as <i>Jackrabbit</i>'s overwrought spectacle unintentionally doubles as ""Indie Rock in the Aughts: The Musical.""</p></div>"|20143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20143-jackrabbit/|5.2|Ian Cohen

Sure, their composition conforms to standard punk-rock parameters—yelping singer, fuzzbox-tweaking guitarist and bassist, pugilistic drummer—but even at its most ferocious, their music lacks the emotionally raw, primal catharsis we associate with post-hardcore acts. They come off more like steely lab technicians administering shock treatment for dubious purposes. You don’t so much listen to a Girl Band song as get strapped into it: militaristic drum stomps mimic the beat of your pounding heart; foreboding, unidentifiable noises emerge suddenly from unseen corners seemingly by the push of a button; and, as they pile on the punishment with sadistic glee, your convulsions effectively form a new dance move.</p>
<p>It’s a drill that Girl Band have been gradually perfecting over the past two years, through a string of singles that have showcased their bone-crushing force, but through markedly different demonstrations, be it 25-second circle-pit blurts or updates of songs by everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"">Beat Happening</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29870-blawan/"">Blawan</a>. While these tracks have been compiled by <a href=""http://www.roughtrade.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rough Trade</a> on <i>The Early Years</i><span> to introduce Girl Band to North American audiences, the EP is also a snapshot of a band still figuring out how to harness the nihilistic noise of punk and the architectural precision of dance music without conforming to the conventions of either.</span></p>
<p>It’s no insult to say that Girl Band’s signature song at this point is a cover—because it's one that perfectly encapsulates both their antagonistic essence and unorthodox methodology. Their grueling distension of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL_Bbyi3ub8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blawan’s ""Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage""</a>from 2013 not only betrayed a vision that looked far beyond punk for inspiration, but proved to be an ideal vehicle for frontman Dara Kiely to assert his split personality: part arch absurdist, part panic-attacked nervous wreck. The band’s hammering 2014 single ""Lawman"" further entrenched these sarcastic/spastic extremes, though, after the past year of awful police-related headlines, the satirical non sequitirs (""He starts every sentence with 'I know I’m not a racist, but…'"") and the song’s violent meltdown climax have acquired an accidental, uncomfortably topical resonance.</p>
<p>Girl Band’s singular qualities are best appreciated in these longer tracks, which clear adequate space for Kiely's wild mood swings, while affording the band enough time to experiment and find just the right dissonant frequencies to power their apocalyptic finales. The more concentrated songs, naturally, give them less to do: the rumble through Beat Happening’s ""I Love You"" is ultimately more a reverential nod to Girl Band’s smart-ass indie ancestors than something they try to fully claim as their own, while the group were in such a rush to unleash half-minute no-fi thrasher ""The Cha Cha Cha"" that they seemingly neglected to master it properly. But ""De Bom Bom"" marks the point where Girl Band’s primordial aggression and burgeoning ambitions start to coalesce, packing all the textural disorientation and mounting intensity of their extended workouts into a taut, three-and-a-half-minute shot.</p>
<p>Like the Girl Band name itself, the title of <i>The Early Years </i> is a silly joke—for one, the EP doesn’t even include the band’s earliest recordings (that would be 2012’s <i>France 98</i> mini-album), and the period that it faux-nostalgically canonizes covers a mere 19-month span that ended just last summer. But the mercurial, combustible potential within suggests we may not be laughing at it for much longer—like patron saints <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4764-they-threw-us-all-in-a-trench-and-stuck-a-monument-on-top/"">equally feral 2001 debut</a>, <i>The Early Years </i> could one day seem like a mere baby step for a band that has evolved into something even more imposing.</p></div>"|20394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20394-the-early-years-ep/|7.2|Stuart Berman

<p>The genesis of the Breathing Effect can be traced to its fascinating <a href=""https://alphapup.bandcamp.com/album/the-breathing-effect-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2014 EP</a>, on which Goss and Terrell spread aquatic rhythms over five tracks. From ""Layers of Thought"" to ""Losing My Mind"", the resulting mixture was equally soothing and mesmerizing; the EP as a whole worked just as well under clear or gray skies. <i>Mars</i> is more upbeat than its predecessor, though the opening tunes—""Forestial Things"" and ""Cloudy Afternoon""—continue the EP’s mellow ambience. Yet by the third song, the two-tiered ""Cold Meteor Showers"", Goss and Terrell hit a stride.</p>
<p><span>In a way, </span><i>Mars</i><span> plays like musical theater: It’s driven by space travel, and follows the story of two lovers cruising the galaxy with no concept of time. Tracks like ""One for the Mountains By the Sea"" and ""Twenty Years Altogether"" recall spacious isolation, of couples escaping life’s hustle to be alone with each other. It’s a notion </span>evoked<span> on album standout, ""Weightless Reality"", </span>where Goss, Terrell and guest vocalist Kalia Vandever sing of a fantasy world of waterfalls and underwater utopia.<span> Whether or not they’re depicting planet Mars is anyone’s guess.  Still, the music conveys a very real narrative while using few words, </span>which is usually a tough task for most instrumental albums.</p>
<p><span>The vocals, sparing as they are, come from </span>Goss, Terrell, Vandever and Michael Mayo<span>, who tend to float along the periphery of the music, underlining the instrumentals. On ""Streetlights Out of Focus"", Mayo drifts softly, his wails a breezy compliment to Goss and Terrell’s </span>composition<span>. And of all the great things happening here—the Isley Brothers vibe on ""Fireflies"", the dense layers of ""Visions""—you can actually </span><i>feel</i><span> the melodies, which remain at the forefront even though the music drifts in all directions. The </span>blend<span> seeps into the background if you let it, but dominates your attention in headphones, played </span>loudly<span>. ""Rising Inside""</span><b>—</b><span>the LP’s best song and one of the group’s finest to date</span><b>—</b><span>uses </span>swift percussion<span>, bright synths and a Vocoder, </span>working<span> up a loud bounce that would fit comfortably within rap circles and jazz crowds, </span>two sects that couldn’t be farther apart these days<span>. It’s a grand culmination for </span>the Breathing Effect<span>: experimental jazz with the potential for huge resonance.</span></p></div>"|20482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20482-mars-is-a-very-bad-place-for-love/|7.9|Marcus J.

He replied with a candid, perhaps-practiced monologue: ""I’m very bright. I’m smart. I’m annoying and obnoxious. I’m <i>very</i> creative and borderline genius, and I think other people are starting to see that, too.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Cherry Bomb</i><span>, Tyler’s fourth long-player and third official album, complements his self-professed characteristics to a T, in ways both good and bad. His greatest strength has always been world-building, using a synth-heavy blitz of candy-colored jazz chords taken straight (sometimes blatantly so) from the Pharrell handbook. </span><i>Cherry Bomb</i><span> isn’t exactly a hard left turn from this lane, but it is a quick swerve.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He’s still occasionally obnoxious and shockingly adolescent for someone almost a quarter-century old (on ""Smuckers"" he defiantly raps, ""Fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat"" with the gusto of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6217-ian-mackaye/"">Ian MacKaye</a> declaring his devotion to straight edge). His idea of a joke is making the lead single to his rap album a Stevie Wonder-inspired bop about an underage relationship. What makes the joke ""land,"" of course, is that the song is really good, a warm-sounding piece of pop music complete with an appearance from the ineffable Charlie Wilson. It’s a smart, annoying, obnoxious, creative, and borderline genius tactic from someone still working on reaching his final form.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The best thing <i>Cherry Bomb</i> has going for it is relative brevity. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15413-goblin/""><i>Goblin</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17805-tyler-the-creator-wolf/""><i>Wolf</i></a> were notoriously long, which felt like a betrayal of one of Tyler’s biggest strengths—shotgun blasts of creativity and anguish as opposed to woozy, multi-part dirges that bordered on self-parody. <i>Cherry Bomb</i> still features three songs that are longer than six minutes, but the songs transform within themselves, like the jazz Tyler admires, so that they almost feel like three songs in one. There's still nothing ""minimalist"" about what Tyler does;<a href=""https://twitter.com/fucktyler/status/587663238055141377"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> this tweet</a> just about sums up his approach to this album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Opener ""Deathcamp"" was allegedly inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">the Stooges</a>, and it sounds like what would happen if you put Tyler's idea of the Stooges on top of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassjaw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glassjaw</a> on top of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28767-trash-talk/"">Trash Talk</a>, and, it should go without saying, on top a vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"">N.E.R.D.</a> production. Your mileage may vary, but I find it thrilling—the influence of rock music, while always present in Tyler’s music, is overwhelming here, which creates a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13116-rebirth/""><i>Rebirth</i></a>-ian wrinkle to an album that, to its strength and detriment, mostly recycles three or four similar ideas. ""Pilot"" and the title track to me recall none other than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6076-big-black"">Big Black</a>—drum machine-led walls of sound that break down and start up again as Tyler struggles to be heard over the noise. He is friends with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"">Toro Y Moi</a>’s Chaz Bundick (who makes an anonymous appearance on filler track ""Run""), and ""Find Your Wings"" is Tyler’s gentlest song to date, an interlude that’s part quiet storm, part Toro, and completely without pretense or sarcasm.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Wayne</a> have verses on ""Smuckers"", the album’s best song. All three artists are auteurs in their own right, and with Tyler’s verses bookending and sandwiching the track and a beat switch thrown in the middle, it’s as if he’s playing hot potato with rap’s most singular voices and inserting himself in their world, a vandal placing his imprimatur on a piece in a gallery. The thrilling part is how at home Kanye and Wayne sound having fun in this playground (Kanye’s ""Richer than white people with black kids/ Scarier than black people with ideas"" is an instant classic, while Wayne slides into a comfortable vintage flow).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There will be a lot of talk about how unfocused or chaotic this album is, but I’ve always taken that as par for the course with any Tyler music. Tyler is still gonna do Tyler things, and it’s refreshing when an artist creates exactly the kind of art they want to create. </span>A quick glance at the announced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59236-tyler-the-creators-cherry-bomb-gets-five-album-covers-physical-release-date/"">five alternate covers</a> to the album was revealing—there’s a real aesthetic consistency to them. I’m reminded of the work of <a href=""http://www.marilynminter.net/paintings/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marilyn Minter</a>, an artist with a similar panache for creating intentionally ugly and tacky art, with the knowing observation, ""Yes, this is ugly, but I can’t stop looking at it."" That may be old hat at this point, but the idea is still such a seductive one: I know it's a mess, I put a lot of work into creating this mess, and it's your problem if you can't handle it. A funhouse mirror doesn’t make sense without knowledge of how a regular mirror works. Tyler, the Creator only creates as the sum of his exhaustive, trying, kaleidoscope self—and I keep looking at him.</p></div>"|20493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20493-cherry-bomb/|6.7|Matthew Ramirez

But before the album was even semi-properly released, it, by all accounts, birthed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"">MF DOOM</a>, who is perhaps the most revered, enigmatic popular underground rapper of the past twenty years. It's not conjecture or a stretch to say that the <i>B<i>lack Bastard</i>s</i> story is DOOM's origin story, and without it there's no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/""><i>Madvillainy</i></a>, no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15114-special-herbs-the-box-set-vol-0-9/""><i>Special Herbs</i></a>, no reason for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59112-mos-def-yasiin-bey-covers-doom/""><span>Mos Def to make seven cover videos</span></a>, no metal-faced Villain getting <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vQ8VWweD8E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel</a>.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Originally scheduled for a 1994 release, <i>Black Bastards </i>was shelved by Elektra Records—ostensibly due to the album's incendiary and controversial artwork—less than a month before it was set to be in stores. The shuttling itself was reportedly low on ceremony and dialogue, but the conversation around the album was not. <i>Billboard</i> columnists Terri Rossi and Havelock Nelson had taken offense to the<i> Black Bastards</i> project in separate columns; The Source magazine editor Jon Shecter, meanwhile, rebutted with an editorial titled ""Corporate Hysteria"", writing, ""[A]s we've seen over the years, it doesn't take much for the bottom-line bigwigs of big business to flip on hip-hop. It seems inevitable that the raw honesty of many rap records would offend enough of mainstream America to put the product at odds with the company selling it.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">  Elektra's decision was based in both fiscal and political realities. Much like Epic Records has abandoned <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32660-bobby-shmurda/"">Bobby Shmurda</a> in wake of their sister company Sony Pictures Entertainment's email hack, Elektra washed their hands of KMD in no small part because of their sister label and distributor's troubles. Warner Bros. had already suffered a stinging blow in 1992, when shareholders voted to remove <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/20251-ice-t"">Ice-T</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5gRIud57jQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cop Killer""</a> from his metal side-project Body Count after protracted finger-pointing and naysaying from then-President George H. W. Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, and co-founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (and future Second Lady) Tipper Gore. This was the struggle that birthed the current version of the black-and-white Parental Advisory label; one that included Dan Quayle pressuring Time Warner to pull <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2Pacalypse_Now"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>2Pacalypse Now</i></a> off shelves.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">  The shelving was the second blow that the group would suffer. A year before, KMD—which had whittled down to a duo, losing Onyx The Birthstone Kid, who performed on their masterful 1991 debut, <i>Mr. Hood</i>—had effectively ceased to exist as a group when Dingilizwe Dumile, aka DJ Subroc, was struck by a car and killed while crossing the Long Island Expressway. Subroc's brother, Daniel Dumile—then known as Zev Love X, now known as MF DOOM—was left to finish the album. It was these twin tragedies that led to Daniel becoming the man in the iron mask; and it's the legend that defines <i>Black Bastards</i>, which is now getting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58800-doom-reissues-kmds-black-bastards-in-childrens-pop-up-book-package/"">its most glamorous re-release yet,</a> some twenty-one years later.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given the backstory, it's no wonder that <i>Black Bastards</i> is being treated like a plot device from the <i>Star Wars</i> reboot. This latest reissue fetishizes the album to the extreme—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58800-doom-reissues-kmds-black-bastards-in-childrens-pop-up-book-package/""><span>it's a children's pop-up book</span></a>. (Rare advance copies and copies of copies have existed since the '90s; in 2001 and 2008, it was made available, respectively by Sub Verse and DOOM's own Metalface Records, the latter who is also responsible for this version.) <i>Black Bastards</i> is often hailed as the best rap album that you've never heard, and this newest reintroduction is not likely to change that: It's targeted exclusively towards collectors and archivists—most of whom would already have the music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, it's apropos, given KMD's tone—they released their first album as teenagers and it featured wide-eyed gazes on heady topics, all delivered with the help of excerpts from foreign language tapes, children's audios, Malcolm X and ""Sesame Street"" characters. <i>  Mr. Hood</i> was whimsical and pointed and prescient—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpYcFMQnfYU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bananapeel Blues""</a> hosted a spoken-word mediation on race with a sped-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28552-gil-scott-heron/"">Gil Scott-Heron</a> sample (from ""H2Ogate Blues"": ""How much more evidence do the citizens need?"") that is still embarrassingly poignant today when the cultural spectacle of Black men being murdered by police has become social media snuff porn.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <i>Black Bastards</i> was so much more and less than its predecessor. It was always a very good record, a promising one—but not a great one. Musically, it sounds like a mid-'90s rap record—copious samples of jazz and R&amp;B over big, dirty drums. It's more angry and less fun that what came before it, but also more intimate and less expansive. Where <i>Mr. Hoo</i>d focused on the big themes out there, <i>Black Bastards</i> turned inward, dealing with the personal coming-of-age revelations. It's largely the story of two devout followers of Dr. York's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuwaubian_Nation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nuwaubianism</a> struggling with the vices of the carnal world. ""Sweet Premium Wine"" is about their newfound love of alcohol—""I don't drink, I guzzle 'til I'm distorted."" On ""Contact Blitt"", they treat smoking weed the way ""Game of Thrones"" treats magic— something wondrous but common, like dragons.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At the time of <i>Black Bastards</i>, corporate rap was still in its infancy, and the music industry was deeply entrenched as a trickle-down gerontocracy, one where the voices of power were largely disconnected from the street-level youth that it fed upon. Harder songs on the album, like ""Get-U-Now"" and ""Gimme!"", can be seen not only as a response to self and label expectations, but also a document of rap's darkening tone and the rites of passage that both entail. When the album deals with women on ""Plumskinzz"", it's deeply lascivious: ""Damned, I wouldn't want my plum to turn prune/ Unless it be all that, be all that/ It won't matter 'cause black sweet ones come fatter/ I'm kinda, kinda picky with my fruit mix."" It's a far cry from the jingly innocence of <i>Mr. Hood</i>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW17mVZqnjI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Peach Fuzz""</a> and as genuinely awkward as burgeoning sexual awareness.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the album's title and artwork, <i>Black Bastards</i> is much less direct about racial politics than <i>Mr. Hood</i>. Where <i>Mr. Hood</i> was incisive and righteous, <i>Black Bastards</i> is searching and confused.   None of this makes it any less worthy of a listen—there's something that's still very real and new about hearing the group move through their emotional spaces. Moreso than listening to the birth of MF DOOM, it's the death of KMD, not just the group, but of both of the guys who made <i>Mr. Hood</i>. And for all of its darkness, there's the unbridled brightness of growing artists still exploring the limits of their medium and textures of their own voices. There's a glee in Subroc's voice when he begins rapping on ""It Sounded Like a Roc!"": ""It's my thing/ Yo, it's my thing/ The way I swing, not even an orangutan can hang/ On my ding! ding!/ Saved by the bell rang/ I talk, yell, whisper, mumble street slang."" It's like wacky <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a> meets <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i></a> and it's the kind of rap that just couldn't be released today. Or rather it can. But only in a pop-up book.</p></div>"|20382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20382-black-bastards/|8.4|kris ex

She went on, ""Oh my god, you look just like Shakira, no, no, you’re Catherine Zeta— actually, my name’s Marina!"" In one verse, she mimicks the voices of those grouping her with other crossover celebrity women who scan simultaneously as ""White"" and ""Other"" to American audiences and answering them, at once. It was a smooth performance, demonstrating her place within American’s <a href=""http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/21/sf.sot021.extract"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>white spatial imaginary </span></a>(Diamandis is Greek and Welsh)— a dream-like double consciousness acknowledged with nary a nod or a wink.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It is within the space of disacknowledgement that Diamandis created the character Electra for her 2012 followup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16579-electra-heart/""><i>Electra Heart</i></a>, an album produced and co-written with American hit makers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a>, Dr. Luke, and StarGate. Electra was a ""cold, ruthless character who wasn’t vulnerable"" she <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2125891/Marina--The-Diamonds-album-review-Electra-Heart-spiky-pop-inspired-failed-romance.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told <i>The Daily Mail</i></a>—a personification of the American Dream. On her third album, <i>Froot</i>, she ditches the mega-star collaborators and writes not only by herself, but about herself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The strength of Diamandis’ work, historically, has been her lack of subtlety, her playful Technicolor self-presentation. And yet on </span><i>Froot</i><span>, her focus is inward and free of peacocking. The hushed, bare-bones opener ""Happy"", built on a piano-ballad core, is a meditation on inner contentedness that seeks self-realization over companionship. ""From the concrete to the coast, I was looking for a holy ghost,"" she sings. On </span><i>Froot</i><span>, she's found God, and pop music, within herself. She is an artist who knows who she is, and <i>Froot</i> luxuriates in the confidence that we do, too, relaxing in the space and power that Diamandis has claimed.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Part of her art has always been to pack the emotional punch of confession while denying over-the-head admission, an approach with a political tinge—""the impersonal is political,"" in her case. Her flamboyance and theatrics have served to both deflect and detach—some songs on<i> Electra Heart </i>and <i>The Family Jewels</i> alluded to an eating disorder without explicitly saying so, while other songs feature second-person lyrics—an implied ""I."" Sharing—thoughts, emotions, information (where you live, what your plans are, take your pick)—is always a risky act for women, opening them up to potential violence, and this is the violence Marina explores. In ""Savages"", Marina sings, ""I’m not afraid of God, I’m afraid of Man."" ""Underneath it all, we’re just savages hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages,"" she posits. ""Solitaire"", which opens with the lyric, ""Don’t wanna talk anymore, I’m obsessed with silence,"" doesn’t land quite as well as its antithesis, the final track ""Immortal"", does. ""Immortal"" is about a deep longing to ""reserve a space"" in history, to be remembered by others.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Almost every song on</span><span> <i>Froot</i> </span><span>plays with memory and sensory imagery—""Gold""; ""Blue""; ""Forget""; ""Froot""—thematically, lyrically or otherwise. But it’s the tucked-in songs—in the ""Weeds"", so to speak—where Marina shines colorfully: ""Happy"", ""I’m a Ruin"" and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/716-when-divas-talk-back/""><span>""Can’t Pin Me Down""</span></a><span> are stand-out tracks, speaking most directly to the album’s core. They’re also the most sonically interesting songs. The bare piano accompaniment of ""Happy"" makes it a somber and sweet track.</span><span> Her production is more understated than the lush, orgasmic pulse of</span><span><i> Electra Heart</i></span><span>, making </span><i>Froot </i><span>a more elastic and dynamic work, with Everestian highs and darker depths. In ""I'm a Ruin"" the drums carry the song, thumping into climax and ecstasy.  The other percussion-heavy tracks, like ""Can’t Pin Me Down"", give the album power and drive. Others, like ""Gold"", go at the tempo of a slow soul clap, taking you to a quiet church. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There’s cognitive dissonance between Diamandis' flamboyant posturing and her subtlety. She </span><i>performs</i><span> feeling. She no longer hides behind shaky, furtive archetypes and characters as she did on </span><i>Electra Heart</i><span>, an album created explicitly for American consumers—she’s untangled herself and trusts us to understand a record that is internal, and rich in nuance. </span><i>Froot</i><span> traces her career arc: with </span><i>The Family Jewels</i><span> she is mistaken (by record companies) for a ""foreign cross-over success"" like Shakira, and with </span><i>Electra Heart </i><span>she tries on this identity and finds that it doesn’t actually fit her. With </span><i>Froot </i><span>she’s refuting the myth that female artists are forever the first, the only, that they can only exist if they fit within the shape of whatever cultural precedent exists for them. Mind the bold corrective: ""</span><span>Actually</span><span>, my name's Marina!"" As if we could forget, now.</span></p></div>"|20368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20368-froot/|7.5|Safy-Hallan Farah

While <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i>'s radio stations followed in the tradition of all <i>GTA</i> soundtracks—disc after disc of meticulously curated mood music, organized by genre—it felt more essentially <i>of</i> the game-world than its predecessors. It was also much larger. Where once there was a rap station, here there were three; where once there was a half-dozen opera songs, here were 40 chillwave tracks. An expanded re-release exacerbated the sprawl, begging the question of how ""Moves Like Jagger"" wasn’t on the pop station in the first place. There wasn’t a bad station among the fifteen, a technical accomplishment on par with the game’s startling evocation of the Pacific southwest sky.</p>
<p>But if <i>GTAV</i> was a digital space meant to evoke and satirize a real-world one, <i>Welcome to Los Santos</i> is engineered to do the opposite. It is a real-world product meant to inspire memories of your time in a digital world. Compiled by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3211-oh-no/"">Oh No</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"">the Alchemist</a>, it repurposes errant bits of the score they created for the game along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> and composer Woody Jackson. Music that originally played as the backing track for a neon-lit shootout now forms the backing track for context-free tracks by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"">Wavves</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28373-phantogram/"">Phantogram</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12970-vybz-kartel/"">Vybz Kartel</a>, and many more. (Also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28274-freddie-gibbs/"">Freddie Gibbs</a> three times, because he is Freddie Gibbs.) Further complicating things, the newest versions of the game will also feature a radio station with these reworked bits of score, now playing as in-world music. This is an album with a uniquely tenuous relationship with reality.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unlikely aspect of it is that it is good, or at least immensely likable, in the same way that, say, the first <i>Iron Man</i> movie was. It breezes by, bright and pricy. These intentions are made clear from the outset. Opener ""Play It Cool"" couches <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29242-gangrene/"">Gangrene</a>’s hard-knock psych-rock in hummingbird flute flourishes and Sam Herring’s butt-chin baritone; the next track, ""Trouble"", has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5045-aloe-blacc/"">Aloe Blacc</a> doing his best Dan Auerbach bellow and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30353-ab-soul/"">Ab-Soul</a> riding a harp-laden instrumental. The emcees perform admirably, but as guest stars, not features; if you don’t like a style, the album says, wait 90 seconds. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>’s Tunde Adebimpe skids in next, another ripple of variety in an album that will also eventually encompass dancehall, clothing-store-tronica, and yearning synth-pop. From the choice of collaborators to the sequencing to the endless evocations of speed and opulence, the album seems engineered to ingratiate, and to dazzle. It is the music blooming out of a club you are supposed to want to go into.</p>
<p>If there is a throughline between this summery mix and Oh No and Alchemist’s other collaborative work as Gangrene, it is this absolute devotion to a concept. Oh No, in particular, has found his muse through an endless sequence of themed projects, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9718-exodus-into-unheard-rhythms/""><i>Exodus into Unheard Rhythms</i></a>’ Galt MacDermont fixation through last year’s <a href=""http://wanderingworx.bandcamp.com/album/animal-serum"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prince Po resuscitation project</a>, but all felt distinctly punched out of the same post-Dilla MPC. <i>Welcome to Los Santos</i> holds no such signature stamp. Its panoply of guests and tones suggests not the well-curated sampling of a film soundtrack or the ambient pulse of the best video game soundtracks but the high-quality ephemerality of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/"">Gorillaz</a> record. It is unified not so much by concept but by character.</p>
<p>But who (or what) is that character? The album ends with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"">Action Bronson</a> lacing an ominous beat, but if you were looking for a centerpiece, they do not provide it. Despite a murderer’s row of talent here, nobody does. Perhaps that's because it’s not their album; they’re all guest stars, on-screen appearing as themselves. The video essay <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379357/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Los Angeles Plays Itself</i></a>, which examines filmic portrayals of the city, is built around director Thom Andersen's suggestion that, ""If we can appreciate documentaries for their dramatic qualities, perhaps we can appreciate fiction films for their documentary revelations."" <i>Welcome to Los Santos</i> suggests a similarly conversational relationship: that games might act as both products of IRL culture and sources of it. At the very least, it gave Freddie Gibbs an outlet for a few more verses. That guy can’t turn it off.</p></div>"|20460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20460-the-alchemist-and-oh-no-present-welcome-to-los-santos/|6.9|Clayton Purdom

Recorded in an empty Ontario grain silo, it was mostly Tony Dekker’s acoustic guitar and honeyed voice singing about silent films and the natural world. The album seemed at first like an ideal sedative—its hushed reverberating folk songs are enhanced with the sound of actual crickets chirping. But the songs were too engaging and eventful to be lullabies.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On <i>A Forest of Arms</i>, their sixth album, Great Lake Swimmers continue to experiment with recording locations, this time tracking some of the vocals and guitar in Ontario’s Tyendinaga Cavern and Caves. But while Dekker is still trying to push his band into new territory with bigger arrangements and peppier tempos, he runs into problems.</p>
<p class=""p2""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">First among the latter is Dekker’s voice. His gentle cooing is perfect for quiet, contemplative ballads but becomes listless in songs like the the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26449-the-new-pornographers/"">New Pornographers</a>-style rave-up ""I Must Have Someone Else’s Blues"" and the bouncy ""A Bird Flew Inside the House"". Still, h</span>e remains economical and fairly straightforward with his words, and it suits him. Lead-off track ""Something Like a Storm"", for example, sweetly describes a father embracing the calm before the storm of childbirth. But the album's sequence trips him up—for some reason the band includes an alternative version, reprising nearly the same lyrics in closing track ""Expecting You"". Once was nice, twice is overkill. </p>
<p class=""p2""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">It’s probably no coincidence this album’s best tracks are the ones where Dekker is singing in a cave with only subtle accompaniment. ""Don’t Leave Me Hanging"" is gorgeous—simple and direct. ""You had different hair when I saw you last,"" Dekker sings, delicately fingerpicking amid the violins, before pleading for his lover (and/or a bird) not to leave him hanging and ""drowning in shallow water.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">The natural world consistently elicits a contagious sense of awe from Dekker. The album takes its title from a line in ""The Great Bear"", another song in this vein. ""You won’t believe what’s out there,"" he sings, and and he's convincing. These moments are as absorbing as those old grain-silo songs, with the same sort of hypnotic pull, as you picture the winding streams and forests Dekker traces. But too often, he strays from the hushed mode he's mastered and ends up supplanting the band’s strengths with its weaknesses.</p></div>"|20403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20403-a-forest-of-arms/|5.4|Joel Oliphint

But by 2013’s masterful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18537-oneohtrix-point-never-r-plus-seven/""><i>R Plus Seven</i></a>, Lopatin was exploring the plasticity of synthesized computer sound: shape-shifting church organs into marimbas, rave anthem tropes into synthesized tropicalia, majestic choirs into intimate female coos.</p>
<p>Following on the heels of last year's <i>Commissions I</i>, this Record Store Day EP documents Lopatin's most recent series of commissions, from two projects situated in Japan. For an artist who overhauls his aesthetic with almost every full-length release, suggesting someone whose identity is as reliable as Mystique, such stop gaps become a necessity for keeping track of his discography. Commissioned by <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Bull Music Academy</a> in Tokyo last November, the first half of the EP, ""Bullet Hell Abstraction"", serves as homage to the popular danmaku (sometimes translated as ""bullet curtain"" or ""bullet hell"") scrolling shooter video games popular in the late '90s, a sensory overload of firepower, swarming enemies and explosions.</p>
<p>The opening volley of ""Bullet Hell Abstraction I"" suggests that Lopatin can mimic thrash metal guitars and make sawed metal dissonance with the best of them (additionally, he also throws in some drill'n'bass delirium worthy of his <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a> labelmates). But such a racket barely lasts past the minute mark before dissolving into shrapnel shards, the elegant ambient drift that was the hallmark of early OPN. From there the track moves in spurts and stops. ""Bullet Hell Abstraction III"" (""BHA II"" and ""IV"" were exclusive to the live concert, according to the label) meanwhile opens with some of the wonky fusion-funk that Lopatin likes to reference with side gigs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a> and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/1928716-Chuck-Person"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chuck Person</a>. The piece begins with a shiny, overblown theme that’s soon pulled apart like taffy, knotting together high frequencies, white noise, and shimmering keys in a scrambled manner last heard on <i>Returnal</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW9MHtYeQCA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""‡ Nil Admirari""</a> and rarely revisited since.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Commissions II</i> comes on the 19-minute opus ""Suite from Magnetic Rose"". Commissioned by <a href=""http://www.andfestival.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Abandon Normal Devices</a> and performed as a live accompaniment in Manchester to Koji Morimoto’s 1995 anime film <i>Magnetic Rose</i> (itself part of a trilogy of short anime from multiple animators entitled <i>Memories</i>), it’s perhaps Lopatin’s most sumptuous and satisfying long-form piece of music to date. ""Magnetic Rose"" feels like the summation of <i>Seven</i>'s explorations, quicksilver in its changes in some regards, yet also taking time to fully revel in some of its most exquisite moments. Electrified water drips turn into weightless drones, Japanese koto plucks melt into bell-like tones. And while parts of <i>R Plus Seven</i> flashed mere glimpses of hallucinatory chorale passages, the latter half of ""Magnetic Rose"" expands these sounds to majestic proportions, evoking those haunting György Ligeti-scored moments of Stanley Kubrick’s <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, be it the black monolith or eerie deep space drift. With a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58586-antony-announces-new-album-hopelessness-co-produced-with-oneohtrix-point-never-and-hudson-mohawke/"">forthcoming collaboration</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"">Antony Hegarty</a> announced as well as a new studio album in the works, one wonders if this might be our last glimpse at this particular side of Lopatin’s polygonal sound. If so, it makes for a satisfying souvenir.</p></div>"|20419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20419-commissions-ii/|8.0|Andy Beta

At age 5 she became the youngest-ever student to enroll at Johns Hopkins University’s Peabody Institute. At 11, she was thrown out due to her inability to sight-read as well as she could play by ear. At 13, she started performing at Washington, D.C.’s piano bars, some of them gay, where—chaperoned by her pastor dad in his clerical collar—she’d take requests and try out her own material. And by 24, she tasted failure when her band Y Kant Tori Read released one Pat Benatar-esque 1988 album that instantly flopped as though it had never even existed.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Being misrepresented on its cover as a sword-wielding, flame-haired metal vixen forced Amos to take control of her image while struggling to satisfy expectations that her prodigious genius generated. </span> (""I had come from child prodigy to 'vapid bimbo,' "" she<a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tori-amos-track-by-track-guide-to-little-earthquakes-20091218"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> told <i>Rolling Stone</i></a> in 2009.) Still contracted to Atlantic Records, she paired with former singer-songwriter Davitt Sigerson, and then with paramour Eric Rosse, but the label nixed both batches of results. So Amos kept on writing and recording, streamlining her music until a tearful viewing of <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i> prompted a song that didn’t need any accompaniment whatsoever. After <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPF_8T2pkAw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Me and a Gun""</a>, no suit dared argue that her album wasn’t finished.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Whereas nearly all of her songs invite interpretation, this one is unquestionably about Amos getting raped. She changed a few details: Her real-life attacker wielded not a gun but a knife, and demanded that his victim sing hymns while he violated her. In the song, Amos mimics simple regimented intervals learned from psalms. Abruptly she breaks free from this steady keel as if mirroring how her psyche detaches from her body in order to deal with what’s happening to her. ""Do you know Carolina where the biscuits are soft and sweet?"" she suddenly wails with startling force before returning to the song's melodic core to explain, ""These things go through your head when there’s a man on your back and you’re pushed flat on your stomach.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This snapped Atlantic to its senses. Drawn almost exclusively from the initial reject pile, <i>Little Earthquakes</i> finally appeared in early 1992, right when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15854-nevermind-20th-anniversary-edition/""><i>Nevermind</i></a> topped the charts. Amos’ solo debut, though it was rarely talked about this way, was similarly radical—an alternately flirty and harrowing work that juxtaposed barbed truths against symphonic flights of fancy. It was lyrically nuanced and harmonically sophisticated exactly when grunge moved rock in a raw and brutish direction, which made her achievement even more striking. Amos was early Queen, early Elton John, and early Kate Bush with Rachmaninoff chops. Decades after prog-rock’s peak, her technical perfection was particularly shocking in the virtuoso-renouncing '90s: Not even Elton could tear into a song both vocally and instrumentally while staring down attendees with a Cheshire Cat grin.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>She did (and still does) this by straddling her piano bench like a lover with one foot pumping pedals and the other beating time, as if sending out long-suppressed erotic urges directly through her music, right at her audience. Listen to the live B-sides sequenced together at the end of each bonus disc that joins these reverently remastered editions of </span><i>Little Earthquakes</i><span> and </span><i>Under the Pink</i><span>, and you’ll hear this carnal communion evolve: At first her delivery </span><span>is</span><span> slightly mannered, and the crowd’s dead silent. But by the second disc, she’s flowing freely, and her following screams ecstatically in kind.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i><i>Earthquakes </i></i><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">chronicles a woman coming to terms with post-traumatic stress disorder. As she’d much later </span><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">explore on 2007’s<i> </i></span><i>American Doll Posse</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">, Amos had split her psyche into separate personas so she could deal with the pressure of being a both a minister’s daughter and prodigy.</span> On this album, Amos finds her truest primary voice, no more so than on her inaugural U.S. single, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSYr0etDzRM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Silent All These Years""</a>, which chronicles that discovery in real time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It was here that she discovered how to obey her compositional muse: Establish a theme, wander from it, and then return via pop’s reassuring verse/chorus/verse structure. Amos would soon drift much, much further from her motifs, but here she’s uncommonly focused: The song’s circling introduction references her conservatory roots by evoking practice exercises, yet it’s catchy, and the bluntest moments in the melody fall exactly when Amos sings the title, a reliable songwriter’s trick.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Yet even in the singer’s most accessible song, idiosyncrasies abound: From intro to opening verse, the tempo slows drastically, and remains irregular. Her right hand on the piano doesn’t always sync with what her left is doing and often accentuates different beats, while her lyric references Satan and menstruation amidst soothing classical filigree. ""Sometimes, I said, sometimes I hear my voice,"" she sings in a tone </span><span>occasionally irked but ultimately joyful</span><span>: Her real self, muted since childhood, finally comes out to play.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For the outsider women and gay men who initially propelled Amos’ success, this hard-won message served as a clarion call, and they embraced her as if uncovering the challenging and most vulnerable parts of themselves. Tracy Chapman, Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, k.d. lang, Sinéad O'Connor, and the Indigo Girls had already begun to reach the same flock, but Amos—by virtue of her sexual intensity and subject matter—instantly commanded a bond only rivaled by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a>, whose eroticism peaked just as Amos arrived. ""Look, I’m standing naked before you/ Don’t you want more than my sex,"" she teased in ""Leather"" over strutting chords that recall Queen’s ""Killer Queen"". Like Madonna, Amos put earthly passions on display not necessarily to seduce her congregation, but to empower herself—and, by extension—her fans.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The difference between '94’s </span><i>Under the Pink</i><span> and its predecessor was that by this time Amos had sold enough to keep </span><span>Atlantic execs</span><span> at bay. In their absence, she and Rosse accentuated the orchestral pomp on some tracks while shrewdly deviating from it on others. Whereas she’d flatly rejected previous requests to replace </span><i>Little Earthquakes</i><span>’ pianos with guitars, here she fits in a few fleetingly noisy ones and bolsters the beat until it grooves.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These adjustments transformed Amos from rising singer-songwriter to major alt-rock upstart: ""Cornflake Girl""—the cartwheeling UK hit that preceded the album and showcases one of her spunkiest solos—helped <i>Pink</i> enter the UK chart at #1, while ""God""—the grousing, gnarly U.S. single—topped modern rock playlists. It’s nice that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">Sam Smith</a> and Hozier subvert the religious overtones of their churchy presentations with orthodoxy-slamming videos, but both lack the clarity and courage of Amos chanting, ""God sometimes you just don’t come through.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The rest wasn’t as pointed as </span><span>that</span><span>, but </span><i>Pink</i><span>’s extroverted arrangements worked as hard as </span><span><i>Earthquakes</i>’ </span><span>lyrics and melodies. Amidst other overseas hits like ""Pretty Good Year"", Amos dug deeper, particularly on ""Bells for Her"", which suggests a ghost pirouetting across John Cage’s prepared piano. The pitch on certain keys is way off, like an old upright in your grandparents’ basement, but the effect is finessed the way Jimi Hendrix bent notes from music to cacophony and back again. ""Can’t stop what’s coming,"" she moans repeatedly while refusing to name her subject. Adulthood? The rupture of a childhood friendship? Orgasm? Amos’ mysteriousness sometimes subsequently got the best of her, but here she masters it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Before, during, and immediately after these breakthroughs, Amos generated enough outtakes, covers, remixes, and live tracks to fill several UK and U.S. variations on each album’s many singles and EPs, all of them designed to generate enough sales from devotees to force radio’s hand. Here, on generous bonus discs, they flow like autonomous albums; the </span><i>Earthquakes</i><span> addendum favors tracks Amos and Atlantic dropped in search of an ideal launch, while the </span><i>Pink</i><span> supplement emphasizes the singer’s knack for reinventing her material on the fly.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Leading with a disc-long alternate version of <i>Earthquakes</i>, Amos’ 2006 box set <i>A Piano: The Collectio</i><i>n</i> already argued that ""Upside Down"" and ""Flying Dutchman""—both Sigerson-produced, string-wrapped efforts—equaled most everything that made the cut. Here, those fan favorites better complement Amos’ impulsive material, like ""Sweet Dreams"", which rewrites David Bowie’s ""Panic in Detroit"" as a Gallic jig, and ""The Pool"", an eerie excursion in extended overdubbed vocal tones that proved Amos boasted the harmonic chops to become a credible avant-garde classical composer. As her many cover versions attest, Amos honed discerning interpretive skills in her piano-bar adolescence: Her eerily funereal 1992 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB2c7_vyBSM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">treatment</a> of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" gently accentuates Kurt Cobain’s desperation while showcasing her exquisite phrasing. Check her timing and dynamics, the way she estranges his melody by pulling buried notes from chords while riding her sustain pedal and then releasing it as if drawing a breath. Even when she holds back, as she does here, Amos seethes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Pink</i>’s outtakes aren’t generally as memorable as <i>Earthquakes</i>’: Aside from her ominous ""Honey"", an eleventh-hour omission she’s <a href=""http://www.yessaid.com/talk/1honey.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> she regrets, the <i>Pink</i> B-sides explore the same mesmeric side of Amos’ songbook as the album’s long and winding ballads. The seven live tracks, however, affirm that Amos could pull more drama from one acoustic piano than ordinary bands draw from several amplified instruments, and not just on the hits. ""Here. In My Head"", a feather-light flip she also admits should’ve been on <i>Pink</i>, gets the knockout climax its studio incarnation denies, while ""Winter""—her disciplined and devastating invocation of childhood’s paradise lost—gets elevated to the level of ""Me and a Gun"", <span>as Amos emotionally amplifies and musically fleshes out every quietly anguished second</span>. It’s astounding.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-7cd0d03d-a4d8-8201-ba3d-d929a2b8da05"">Tori Amos arrived in an era when an unconventional, confrontational artist could also be commercial. Both <i>Earthquakes</i> and <i>Pink</i> went double-platinum in the U.S., and although American Top 40 radio never accommodated her, Amos managed to generate modern rock, adult contemporary, and dance club hits for 10 solid years before settling into cult-heroine status. Naturally, others came to wear her crown of anomalies and thorns: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/""><span>Lana Del Rey</span></a> remains the sole mainstream act to adroitly juxtapose and underplay personal trauma with classical finery, yet the legacy of these milestones linger over today’s underground: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"">Bat for Lashes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31317-john-grant/"">John Grant</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5734-lykke-li/"">Lykke Li</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett"">Owen Pallett</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"">Perfume Genius</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty"">Antony Hegarty</a>, and others all wear their sensitivities as strengths as she did.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>She did (and still does) this by straddling her piano bench like a lover with one foot pumping pedals and the other beating time, as if sending out long-suppressed erotic urges directly through her music, right at her audience. Listen to the live B-sides sequenced together at the end of each bonus disc that joins these reverently remastered editions of </span><i>Little Earthquakes</i><span> and </span><i>Under the Pink</i><span>, and you’ll hear this carnal communion evolve: At first her delivery </span><span>is</span><span> slightly mannered, and the crowd’s dead silent. But by the second disc, she’s flowing freely, and her following screams ecstatically in kind.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i><i>Earthquakes </i></i><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">chronicles a woman coming to terms with post-traumatic stress disorder. As she’d much later </span><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">explore on 2007’s<i> </i></span><i>American Doll Posse</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">, Amos had split her psyche into separate personas so she could deal with the pressure of being a both a minister’s daughter and prodigy.</span> On this album, Amos finds her truest primary voice, no more so than on her inaugural U.S. single, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSYr0etDzRM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Silent All These Years""</a>, which chronicles that discovery in real time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It was here that she discovered how to obey her compositional muse: Establish a theme, wander from it, and then return via pop’s reassuring verse/chorus/verse structure. Amos would soon drift much, much further from her motifs, but here she’s uncommonly focused: The song’s circling introduction references her conservatory roots by evoking practice exercises, yet it’s catchy, and the bluntest moments in the melody fall exactly when Amos sings the title, a reliable songwriter’s trick.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Yet even in the singer’s most accessible song, idiosyncrasies abound: From intro to opening verse, the tempo slows drastically, and remains irregular. Her right hand on the piano doesn’t always sync with what her left is doing and often accentuates different beats, while her lyric references Satan and menstruation amidst soothing classical filigree. ""Sometimes, I said, sometimes I hear my voice,"" she sings in a tone </span><span>occasionally irked but ultimately joyful</span><span>: Her real self, muted since childhood, finally comes out to play.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For the outsider women and gay men who initially propelled Amos’ success, this hard-won message served as a clarion call, and they embraced her as if uncovering the challenging and most vulnerable parts of themselves. Tracy Chapman, Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, k.d. lang, Sinéad O'Connor, and the Indigo Girls had already begun to reach the same flock, but Amos—by virtue of her sexual intensity and subject matter—instantly commanded a bond only rivaled by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a>, whose eroticism peaked just as Amos arrived. ""Look, I’m standing naked before you/ Don’t you want more than my sex,"" she teased in ""Leather"" over strutting chords that recall Queen’s ""Killer Queen"". Like Madonna, Amos put earthly passions on display not necessarily to seduce her congregation, but to empower herself—and, by extension—her fans.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The difference between '94’s </span><i>Under the Pink</i><span> and its predecessor was that by this time Amos had sold enough to keep </span><span>Atlantic execs</span><span> at bay. In their absence, she and Rosse accentuated the orchestral pomp on some tracks while shrewdly deviating from it on others. Whereas she’d flatly rejected previous requests to replace </span><i>Little Earthquakes</i><span>’ pianos with guitars, here she fits in a few fleetingly noisy ones and bolsters the beat until it grooves.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These adjustments transformed Amos from rising singer-songwriter to major alt-rock upstart: ""Cornflake Girl""—the cartwheeling UK hit that preceded the album and showcases one of her spunkiest solos—helped <i>Pink</i> enter the UK chart at #1, while ""God""—the grousing, gnarly U.S. single—topped modern rock playlists. It’s nice that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">Sam Smith</a> and Hozier subvert the religious overtones of their churchy presentations with orthodoxy-slamming videos, but both lack the clarity and courage of Amos chanting, ""God sometimes you just don’t come through.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The rest wasn’t as pointed as </span><span>that</span><span>, but </span><i>Pink</i><span>’s extroverted arrangements worked as hard as </span><span><i>Earthquakes</i>’ </span><span>lyrics and melodies. Amidst other overseas hits like ""Pretty Good Year"", Amos dug deeper, particularly on ""Bells for Her"", which suggests a ghost pirouetting across John Cage’s prepared piano. The pitch on certain keys is way off, like an old upright in your grandparents’ basement, but the effect is finessed the way Jimi Hendrix bent notes from music to cacophony and back again. ""Can’t stop what’s coming,"" she moans repeatedly while refusing to name her subject. Adulthood? The rupture of a childhood friendship? Orgasm? Amos’ mysteriousness sometimes subsequently got the best of her, but here she masters it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Before, during, and immediately after these breakthroughs, Amos generated enough outtakes, covers, remixes, and live tracks to fill several UK and U.S. variations on each album’s many singles and EPs, all of them designed to generate enough sales from devotees to force radio’s hand. Here, on generous bonus discs, they flow like autonomous albums; the </span><i>Earthquakes</i><span> addendum favors tracks Amos and Atlantic dropped in search of an ideal launch, while the </span><i>Pink</i><span> supplement emphasizes the singer’s knack for reinventing her material on the fly.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Leading with a disc-long alternate version of <i>Earthquakes</i>, Amos’ 2006 box set <i>A Piano: The Collectio</i><i>n</i> already argued that ""Upside Down"" and ""Flying Dutchman""—both Sigerson-produced, string-wrapped efforts—equaled most everything that made the cut. Here, those fan favorites better complement Amos’ impulsive material, like ""Sweet Dreams"", which rewrites David Bowie’s ""Panic in Detroit"" as a Gallic jig, and ""The Pool"", an eerie excursion in extended overdubbed vocal tones that proved Amos boasted the harmonic chops to become a credible avant-garde classical composer. As her many cover versions attest, Amos honed discerning interpretive skills in her piano-bar adolescence: Her eerily funereal 1992 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB2c7_vyBSM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">treatment</a> of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" gently accentuates Kurt Cobain’s desperation while showcasing her exquisite phrasing. Check her timing and dynamics, the way she estranges his melody by pulling buried notes from chords while riding her sustain pedal and then releasing it as if drawing a breath. Even when she holds back, as she does here, Amos seethes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Pink</i>’s outtakes aren’t generally as memorable as <i>Earthquakes</i>’: Aside from her ominous ""Honey"", an eleventh-hour omission she’s <a href=""http://www.yessaid.com/talk/1honey.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> she regrets, the <i>Pink</i> B-sides explore the same mesmeric side of Amos’ songbook as the album’s long and winding ballads. The seven live tracks, however, affirm that Amos could pull more drama from one acoustic piano than ordinary bands draw from several amplified instruments, and not just on the hits. ""Here. In My Head"", a feather-light flip she also admits should’ve been on <i>Pink</i>, gets the knockout climax its studio incarnation denies, while ""Winter""—her disciplined and devastating invocation of childhood’s paradise lost—gets elevated to the level of ""Me and a Gun"", <span>as Amos emotionally amplifies and musically fleshes out every quietly anguished second</span>. It’s astounding.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-7cd0d03d-a4d8-8201-ba3d-d929a2b8da05"">Tori Amos arrived in an era when an unconventional, confrontational artist could also be commercial. Both <i>Earthquakes</i> and <i>Pink</i> went double-platinum in the U.S., and although American Top 40 radio never accommodated her, Amos managed to generate modern rock, adult contemporary, and dance club hits for 10 solid years before settling into cult-heroine status. Naturally, others came to wear her crown of anomalies and thorns: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/""><span>Lana Del Rey</span></a> remains the sole mainstream act to adroitly juxtapose and underplay personal trauma with classical finery, yet the legacy of these milestones linger over today’s underground: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"">Bat for Lashes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31317-john-grant/"">John Grant</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5734-lykke-li/"">Lykke Li</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett"">Owen Pallett</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"">Perfume Genius</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty"">Antony Hegarty</a>, and others all wear their sensitivities as strengths as she did.

At the time Kit captain Kate Stables hadn’t even released a debut single, let alone a full album, but that made her an ideal inclusion: a less established artist who could benefit from proximity to more popular names while demonstrating the depth and breadth of the scene. Built around a deftly picked guitar theme and showcasing her earthy vocals, ""2 Wooden Spoons"" held its own against Stables’ contemporaries. But nearly a decade later—when folk has fully embedded itself in the indie mainstream such that we’ve dropped the ""freak"" appendage altogether—the song carries very few of the signifiers that might anchor it to that long-past trend.</span></p>
<p>Stables wears her eccentricities comfortably, whether she's bending an old word into new shapes or displaying a curious sense of professional timing. <a href=""http://www.sundaybest.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sunday Best</a>, the label that released <i>Folk Off</i>, quickly issued her debut 7'', with a full-length debut, <i>Krulle Bol</i>, released a year later. <i>Wriggle Out the Restless</i> followed in 2010, and the folksy austerity of her music caught the ear of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7136-aaron-dessner/"">Aaron Dessner</a>, who not only signed her to his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=brassland"">Brassland</a> label but secured an opening slot for This Is the Kit when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a> played New York in 2011. Four years later, Stables is releasing her third album, <i>Bashed Out</i>, which Dessner inevitably produced. This is Slow Music: patiently and carefully handcrafted, as though the process were just as important as the result, and released on her own whim rather than by industry dictate.</p>
<p>These new songs don’t sound terribly different from Stables’ first recordings nearly a decade ago, but the music is bolder and more purposeful, with a broader, richer palette of sounds. Dessner works in a minimalist vein, placing a handful of instruments at various levels in the mix but never locking them into place. A barely audible bassline rocks softly against Stables’ plaintive guitar theme on opener ""Misunderstanding"". ""Silver John"" blossoms into a swell of synths (courtesy of Thomas Bartlett a.k.a. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1258-doveman/"">Doveman</a>) and builds to a chorus of odd siren vocal calls. There’s a parallax quality to the music, an immersive sense of depth that makes the songs sound larger with each listen.</p>
<p>Even as he expands her range and emphasizes her idiosyncrasies, Dessner wisely stays out of Stables’ way, and she emerges easily as the dominant force on <i>Bashed Out</i>. Her guitar work is nimble but not fussy, and she conjures a sense of nameless menace on closer ""Cold and Got Colder"". On ""Spores All Settling"" her banjo playing is almost pointedly rudimentary, emphasizing the present moment rather than the perfect performance. She’s a complex and compelling personality, spiking her folksy whimsy (there’s a song about the smell of mushrooms) with shots of prickly wisdom. ""And so the outside, it bashes us in, bashes us about a bit,"" she sings on the title track, one of the album’s weightiest moments. </p>
<p>For Stables, creating music—or making art of any kind—means bashing right back at life, matching it blow for blow. Yet, this resilient album is less concerned with enduring immense tribulations than it is with enjoying life’s simple pleasures. Stables’ concerns are microcosmically personal, trading in minute details and small observations that provide immense contentment. ""Vitamins"" is an ode to fresh greens, while ""Nits"" describes sheep on a hillside as ""happy little fatties."" Both songs land <i>just</i> this side of unbearably precious, but Stables doesn’t seem to care how such moments strike the listener. After almost a decade presenting herself as This Is the Kit, she has learned to root her music firmly in her own quirks rather than in the demands of any particular genre or trend.</p></div>"|20417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20417-this-is-the-kit-bashed-out/|7.2|Stephen M.

To take rudimentary machine beats and attack them with scouring pads is neither new nor even particularly interesting in and of itself, but what distinguishes Low Jack's work is the way he seems to be groping his way towards his own musical language, one beyond the limits of either noise or techno as conventionally rendered. On his debut album, last year's <i>Garifuna Variations</i>, he twisted archival recordings of Central America's Garifuna people into grimy knots as part of a commission from Paris' Quai Branley Museum. Cut loose from the conceptual framework and institutional ties, <i>Sewing Machine</i> is a far freer album, and a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Most of the tracks here play out pretty much the same way: fire up the drum machine, run it through a mazelike signal path, and twist at the knobs until the air itself seems to bleed. Of all the people making distorted techno right now (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29118-kyle-hall/"">Kyle Hall</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32647-delroy-edwards/"">Delroy Edwards</a>, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/kupfer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Florian Kupfer</a>), few make their noise sing quite as expressively as Low Jack. It's impressive how much mileage he gets from a simple distorted bass drum. On each track, it's treated in a slightly different way, so that it has a different color and shape—round here, lumpy there, and over there, pocked with metal studs. In the turgid ""Fubu Knight"", through some arcane feat of audio sculpting, the snare drum sounds almost like a drawn-out scream. On the headbanging ""Sweatpants Chick"", probably the most unabashedly lunkheaded thing here right down to the title, he plays his filter's resonance knob like an instrument, wringing the approximation of a melody out of its swoops and shrieks. The filter also takes center stage on ""Zaltan's Jackets""; this time it quacks like Donald Duck, strutting and squelching in between medicine-ball-sized kick drums.</p>
<p>Not a lot of daylight typically makes it onto a Low Jack production, and that's particularly true of <i>Sewing Machine</i>; he might just as well have called it <i>50 Words for Coal</i>. ""Pocket Pussy"" begins with a squall of sooty white noise that's even uglier than the introductory track, which is an 87-second blast that sounds like a gurgle from the bowels of hell. But stick with it, and Hallais begins to show his handiwork. A minute in, kick drums come bursting through the murk followed by blotchy bass frequencies, and then the high-end chatter descends, alien and insistent. Fading out over a rhythm that might be sharpening knives, the six-minute track has the dramatic arc of a radio play—not bad for something made with little more than a drum machine and fuzzbox. <i>Sewing Machine</i> certainly isn't for everyone, but for listeners who like their noise as expressive as it is brutal, this slim album speaks volumes.</p></div>"|20418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20418-sewing-machine/|7.4|Philip Sherburne

At the time Calder seemed like a mismatch for a group defined by outsized presences: She’s not a born star like Case, nor is she an enigma like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"">Dan Bejar</a>, or a pop savant like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3100-ac-newman/"">A.C. Newman</a>. Her defining characteristic is her ordinariness, but ultimately that’s what has made her such a welcome foil to her colorful bandmates. She grounds the group, and while she may not be a marquee attraction, over their last few albums, her spotlight turns have become reliable standouts.<br/><br/> As with most of her co-leads in the Pornographers, the music Calder releases on her own shares little relation to that band’s escapist pop. For one thing, nobody ever dies on a New Pornographers record. Though its cover promised precious twee, Calder’s 2010 solo debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14510-are-you-my-mother/""><i>Are You My Mother?</i></a> was an emotionally heavy listen shaped by her mother’s battle with ALS. The shadow of death also hung over her more assertive and synth-driven follow-up <i>Bright and Vivid</i>, which added her father to her list of loved ones to grieve.<br/><br/>Death has been such a constant on her solo albums that by now its presence is just assumed. Even though she seldom addresses it directly on her self-titled third album, it’s always there. It’s present in the opener ""Slow Burning"", when she pleads for help coping with the nightmares that wake her, and it lingers to the very end of ""Remembering"", when she shares an afternoon in the sun with her lover and sings, ""Time will smoke us out but it’s really good to be here just like this.""<br/><br/>The album is filled with anecdotes like that, peaceful moments interrupted by reminders of life’s impermanence. It’s as if every time Calder set out to write a love song, she emerged instead with a portrait of survivor's guilt. But even at their most melancholy, Calder’s songs are less concerned with mourning than with living. To judge by these songs, her losses have reshaped her view or the world, leaving her with a Zen-like sense of acceptance. On the jaunty ""Take a Little Time"", the closest the album comes to New Pornographers-style hookiness, she assures her lover she’s not interested in holding grudges. Even the prospect of romantic failure doesn’t faze her. ""If we fall, then we fall,"" she sings on ""Song in Cm"".</p>
<p class=""p1""><br/> Like Calder’s previous solo albums, this one was produced with the man she ostensibly wrote many of these songs about, her husband Colin Stewart. But this effort feels distinct from its predecessors, more intimate but also more considered. It does more while calling less attention to itself. Calder often sings in little more than a murmur, as if retreating from the world, and Stewart’s production matches her voice. The understated mix disguises just how much instrumental and textural variation runs through these songs. Save for a few moments when the guitars boil over, the record plays as if covered by a blanket of snow. <br/> <br/> Apparently it took some trial and error to capture that delicate mode. In interviews, Calder has described the album as a second attempt, following an LP’s worth of material she recorded then scrapped. That do-over involved writing new songs and rewriting others, but it’s easy to imagine her just re-recording the same album, only quieter. In Calder's songs solace proves elusive and fleeting, but when she finds it, it's always during moments of calm.</p></div>"|20467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20467-kathryn-calder/|6.8|Evan Rytlewski

So it came as a surprise that they followed it up with a pitch-black, punishing take on Americana titled after, of all things, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8318-creedence-clearwater-revival/"">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> song. Its timing was ripe, arriving amidst the culture wars of the Reagan era: Gordon and Moore cast a shadowy portrait slicked in sweat and blood, not unlike the nightmarish caricatures of American institutions you often saw on the cover art for hardcore bands.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the band’s fury ran deeper than that. As Gordon recalls in her recent memoir <i>Girl in a Band</i>: ""I ... preferred to sing about the darkness shimmering beneath the shiny quilt of American pop culture""—more specifically, ""the westward pull, the American romance with death,"" as well as the collision of this all-American death-drive with the hopeful ecstasies of the hippie generation. Where Time Life Books was busy commemorating and canonizing Woodstock, Gordon and Moore raised up the leering specter of Charles Manson, highlighting the thin lines separating free love from violent sexual anarchy, and how such spaces are often exploited to attain power.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Bad Moon Rising </i><span>is obsessed with sex and power, specifically with how one informs the other. It is the band’s most explicitly sexual album, and among its darkest. ""I Love Her All the Time"", ""I’m Insane"", and ""Halloween"" (a bonus track that’s since become standard on all CD versions of the album) develop female subjects as supplicants to male authority figures, ceding their bodies (and therefore, their identities) to them as if there’s no other choice. ""</span>She’s on my side,"" Moore coolly says of his strung-out paramour on ""I Love Her All the Time"", repeating the song’s title with the unsavory enthusiasm of a cult leader who’s finally cracked the code. On ""Halloween"", Gordon struggles to identify just what it is that makes her succumb to a man’s wiles, finally theorizing ""it’s the devil in me"": the female sex drive, corrupted.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><span><i>Bad Moon Rising</i> is not so much a collection of songs as it is an extended, unending uproar, seamless in sound and theme. </span> This is partially due to the band’s recording strategy, </span><span>which translated the ebb-and-flow of their live show at the time into a singular composition. At this point in their career, Sonic Youth didn’t have guitar techs to assist during shows, and long stretches of feedback between songs allowed them time to tune. On the album, this approach lends itself well to a constantly shifting tableau of American nightmares, beginning with the primordial fury of ""Brave Men Run (In My Family)"" and barreling towards its final destination: Manson’s Death Valley and the terror of Helter Skelter. </span></p>
<p>In <i>Bad Moon Rising</i>’s world, the country’s loss of innocence—and its sexual corruption—began with an assault, chronicled in the terrifying ""Ghost Bitch"". Moore sounds possessed on the following, mournful track, ""I’m Insane"", a sinister piece assembled entirely of fragments from pulp novels like ""a steaming swamp,"" ""murdered angels,"" and the head-scratching ""inside my head my dog’s a bear."" It’s less a song and more the no wave aural equivalent of refrigerator magnet poetry, but it functions remarkably well within the album’s overarching narrative.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But what happens when women reclaim their bodies and fight back? Years before riot grrrl, ""Flower"" (a bonus track released after </span><i>Bad Moon Rising </i><span>alongside ""Halloween"" on 12” and added to the album in subsequent reissues) encapsulated the sex-positive sentiments, as well as the noise, of the forthcoming movement. Gordon's chanted manifesto, delivered over a paranoid, unstable rumble, urges us to ""support the power of women"" by ""us[ing] the power of man."" The nature of this power, of course, is sex, but Gordon’s vision encompasses more than the act itself; her culminating directive of ""Use the word/ FUCK!"" commands a recognition of women as carnal, sexual beings. ""The word is love,"" she adds, completing a circular logic proof of sorts: Power is sex, but sex is love; love is universal, so universal recognition of sex has the ability to empower all. Granted, ""Flower"" might scan as slightly hippie-dippy next to Kathleen Hanna’s acerbic prose, but its mangled punk instrumentation and feminist politics set a precedent.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Bad Moon Rising</i> reaches both its climax and conclusion with the Manson-inspired madness of ""Death Valley ’69"", Moore’s infamous duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2557-lydia-lunch/"">Lydia Lunch</a>, and the closest the album comes to producing a viable single. A tortured yell drags the record out of the doldrums of the preceding ""Justice Is Might"" and into a busted-up Chevy parked in Death Valley on some dead night, in the Summer of Love. Moore and Lunch don’t try to harmonize or sing on key, because their minds aren’t on the melody; they wail over and under one another like coyotes in heat. A single glance over the lyrics suggests another instance of male-on-female violence (""She started to holler/ I didn't wanna/ But she started to holler/ So I had to hit it""). And yet, the ecstasy with which Lunch vocalizes all but says ""This is a game, I’m trying to get you, and I’m winning."" The balance of power shifts once more as Lunch unleashes that orgasmic shriek at song's end: a brilliant imitation of the whimpering guitars, a final paean to chaos before the fade to black.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite its compelling aesthetic, <i>Bad Moon Rising </i>suffers from a few technical shortcomings which become more evident in this remastering, specifically Bob Bert’s tom-heavy approach to the drums. They play a critical role in conveying the primal energy coursing through ""Brave Men Run (In My Family)"" and ""Society Is a Hole"", but the atmospheric boost quickly wears thin: not just because he sounds like he’s drumming with crab mallets, but because he can’t be bothered to beef up his fills or do little more than the bare minimum. One can’t help but long for the frenzied kit work of Steve Shelley, the hardcore-schooled, improvisatory percussionist who succeeded Bert. Additionally, your mileage may vary where vocal melodies, particularly Moore’s, are concerned; his grating refrains on ""Society Is a Hole"" and ""I Love Her All the Time"" show he hadn’t yet developed the tightness and control he would exhibit later. That said, this dissonance is a defining aspect of early Sonic Youth albums, and some might find it refreshing compared to the straitlaced sound of, say, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP3ovD8ZSS4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Incinerate""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Since its release, <i>Bad Moon Rising </i>has left behind many legacies. Thanks to the mangled mass of the guitars, as well as the lack of anthemic verse-chorus-verses structure that dominated <i>Daydream Nation</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7349-goo-deluxe-edition/""><i>Goo</i></a>, the LP is regarded by many as Sonic Youth's most ""difficult"" album. Fans of contemporary acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a> (who Sonic Youth toured with prior to the <i>Bad Moon Rising</i> sessions) might find in the record’s structure a source of catharsis and narrative strength. Those who became fans post <i>Daydream Nation</i>, meanwhile, will need to re-acclimate themselves to the pitch-black soundscapes. And while the task may seem imposing, it’s also immediate and engrossing; after being immersed in this album's world, it’s jarring to return to the real one—and perhaps, by extension, Sonic Youth’s subsequent catalog, which never quite revisited the sheer alienation of <i>Bad Moon Rising.</i></p></div>"|20428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20428-bad-moon-rising/|8.1|Zoe Camp

Tenzer goes on to break down the etymology: ""Batu means rock or stone, and malablab is the active form of the incisively onamonopedic verb ‘to boil.’ A gamelan deserving of the sobriquet ‘boiling rock’ is likely going nowhere fast."" It’s tempting to assume that by adopting this phrase as the title of his debut solo LP, M.C. Schmidt is essentially taking the piss, making an esoteric jibe at himself. Yet there’s precedent: while an intellectual rigor informs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"">Matmos</a>, the Baltimore-based electronic duo Schmidt operates with bandmate/partner Drew Daniel, a playfully self-deprecating streak runs through the group’s public and recorded personas.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Recorded live at a series of locations by Schmidt, Due Process’ Thomas Dimuzio, Jon ""Wobbly"" Leidecker, and others, </span><i>Batu Malablab </i><span>has a ""magic eye"" quality, in the sense that initially listening to it is like watching a stranger empty her junk drawer. There are so many sonic odds and ends present, unleashed with what seems like such a gleeful disdain for compositional Western structure, that the impulse is to throw up one’s hands and surrender. Surrender often enough, though, and patterns emerge, seams begin to show.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s a loose, off-the-cuff vibe to these proceedings that’s worlds apart from Matmos’ sample-pasted, referent-laden grooves, or the metal and punk covers Daniel retools in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3860-the-soft-pink-truth/"">Soft Pink Truth</a> guise. A tangle of gong- and chime-like sounds inaugurates ""Lowland Side"", giving way to bass tones and re-emerging later among scurrying flutes. Prepared piano figures and mysterious scraps of percussion peek out of the humid gloom, then disappear into it, punctuated by occasional bird call samples. Somewhere along the line, the players glide into a peculiar species of out music, with a bass solo accompanying sounds that resemble a mechanic rummaging furtively through tools, bolts, and screws, eventually supplanted by a spine-tingling choir. It’s a fascinating, almost mystic pile-up: elements of Eastern and American Indian music mingling for cocktails, then taking in a m<span>usique concrète</span> set.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Less plainly predetermined than thrillingly accidental, <i>Batu Malablab</i> seems, at times, comprised of desperate misadventures.  Even when the recording does find its footing, the clamor retains a hint of streamlined anarchy that is, in its odd way, downright meditative: a rattling, seething ambience that quotes a number of genres<span>—</span>New Age, opera, world music, assorted species of avant-garde that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> celebrated on <i>Goodbye 20th Century</i><span>—</span>without being fully in thrall to any of them.

Troubleman Unlimited, the label he founded in 1993, started from a foundation of noisy hardcore—bands like <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/263538-Rorschach-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rorschach</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4427-unwound/"">Unwound</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3622-rye-coalition/"">Rye Coalition</a>—and expanded to include a staggering range of music, from danceable post-punk (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1354-erase-errata/"">Erase Errata</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4343-tussle/"">Tussle</a>) to noise and power electronics (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2016-hair-police/"">Hair Police</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5284-john-wiese/"">John Wiese</a>) to new-school goth (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"">Zola Jesus</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27869-pocahaunted/"">Pocahaunted</a>). When the rock world could no longer contain his ambitions, the obsessive record collector and one-time club promoter—at 17, he had flyered for New York’s Mars nightclub, where Vin Diesel worked the door and Bobby Konders spun house and dancehall—teamed up with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"">Chromatics</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1728-glass-candy/"">Glass Candy</a> producer Johnny Jewel to create <a href=""http://italiansdoitbetter.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Italians Do It Better</a>. The label became a platform for disco and synth-pop, as well as more esoteric beatmakers like Professor Genius and Invisible Conga People.</p>
<p>Pale Blue is Simonetti’s latest project. A new alias on a new label (2MR, or Two Mikes Records, a collaboration with <a href=""http://www.capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>’ Mike Sniper), it is nominally a solo affair, though a singer named Elizabeth Wight, of the San Francisco duo <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/silver-hands"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Silver Hands</a>, plays a key role, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28880-lower-dens/"">Lower Dens</a>’ Jana Hunter shows up on one of the key cuts. The title tells you something about its emotional register—wistful, elegiac, bittersweet— and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">the Field</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a> both offer clear antecedents for Pale Blue’s billowing synthesizers and yearning vocals. But for all the grandeur Simonetti wants to summon, Pale Blue’s sound is also modest, making the most of Wight's voice, layering and looping her to create an airy background wash that casts a rosy sunset glow over everything. Simonetti’s approach to structure, meanwhile, resembles a zoned-out road worker painting stripes on a lonely stretch of desert highway: Not a lot changes, but then, it’s not supposed to. The intensity rises and falls with the rolling hills, but the vistas remain the same, and the horizon never gets any closer.</p>
<p>Despite the uniformity, there are clear highlights. The title track is a big, bold, feel-good bummer of a tune that finds Wight testing the lower limits of her register, sounding a little like Siouxsie amidst a gleaming array of contrapuntal synths. ""Dusk in Parts"", the other obvious single, makes the most of Jana Hunter’s desolate wail, while the monotone bassline offers a sullen deadweight counterpoint to sentimental Rhodes melodies and chimes that glint like tear-stained cheeks. ""The Math"" could actually be mistaken for a <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a> release—if the recent ""Blurred Lines"" verdict actually counted as legal precedent, Heiko Voss and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"">DJ Koze</a> might conceivably take Simonetti to court for so skillfully replicating the vibe of Voss’ Kompakt Pop classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH5OIGXasEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Think About You (DJ Koze Mix)""</a>, and I say that in the most complimentary way possible. From the strings to the horn stabs to the buoyant background vocals, it’s a triumphant example of Simonetti at his extroverted best. The Bruce Springsteen cover ""Tougher"", on the other hand, represents the other end of the spectrum: it plays its cards close to the vest, with a trim arpeggio opening up only as much as necessary while Wight mutters come-ons. Her spoken-word vocals never quite synch with the beat, either, and as a result, it yanks us out of the production’s hypnotic swirl.</p>
<p>Some of the album’s more middling tracks—""Distance to the Waves"", ""Myself"", ""The Eye""—feel only halfway there. Simonetti has no issue letting a track that consists only of a single wavering chord and some ethereal background vocals drag on for seven-and-a-half minutes (""The Rain""). But if this 67-minute album is not without filler, even those airy expanses are perfectly pleasant. This unwillingness to edit himself was also an issue on Simonetti’s solo EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15678-capricorn-rising-ep/""><i>Capricorn Rising</i></a>, in which one song appeared in three different versions, comprising nearly half of the record’s running time. This tendency is ironic, because it moves in the opposite of Simonetti’s approach as a label head. It speaks, perhaps, to the perfectionist’s desire to come up with the best possible version of a particular sketch—unable to pick a favorite, he simply presents all its iterations, at unabridged lengths. But maybe that has to do with a desire to wring the most out of a given idea—the most pleasure, the most yearning, the most eyes-closed, lost-in-a-dream intensity beneath a slowly twirling disco ball.</p></div>"|20297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20297-the-past-we-leave-behind/|6.9|Philip Sherburne

There are traces of genres they’ve already spent some time exploring: British post-punk, '70s soul and funk, late '60s krautrock. The band recorded <i>Infinite House</i> in wildly different environments—Benton, Mississippi and Brooklyn—which serve as central and opposing life forces for the album. One minute murmuring, echoed vocals imitate spirits in a Southern forest, and the next frontman Carlos Hernandez is texting a lover and bemoaning the cost of living. It’s a scatterbrained trip, one that invites you to nestle into its grooves and get comfy before it rudely catapults you out again. </p>
<p>Take, for example, opener ""Company"". A muted bass line thumps through the first minute, joined by some leisurely strumming and a faint hi-hat. Drummer Julian Fader abruptly cues the rest of the band in for an outburst of noise and distortion as Hernandez hollers in sheer desperation, ""<i>Do you appreciate my company?</i>"" This is a group that basks in these kinds of bipolar switches, slinking away to a new mood just as they’d gotten grips on the one preceding it.</p>
<p>Nonsense is intrinsic to Ava Luna, and either of its two backup singers (Felicia Douglass and Becca Kauffman) is prone to breaking out into gibberish at any given moment. But they take this tendency to a new level on ""Tenderize"" when Kauffman breathily scats between Hernandez’s anxious yelps like a jazz club singer. Douglass’ shadowy harmonies counteracts them both, closing in the gaps at exactly the right points. When the group builds on each other this way, the result is eerily mystical. This layering works similarly on ""Coat of Shellac"", blending the slickness of R&amp;B with the harshness of post-punk and unpredictability of no wave.</p>
<p>The album has a loose, playful energy, and always seems to be ready to pounce on you. Skittish guitar improvisations tangle with neo-soul percussion on ""Steve Polyester"", while Kauffman alternates between speaking and sliding into song sporadically, as if by accident. ""Black Dog"" starts off with Hernandez telling a seductive, drowsy tale over a few simple guitar chords, allowing for a much-needed moment of respite. Of course, that too gives way to the dissonance, accompanied by haunting, gospel choir gang vocals. He often riffs on freewheeling blues-rock in the style of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a>, most prominently during the serrated rhythms of ""Best Hexagon"".</p>
<p>The most bizarre track—if forced to pick one—is ""Victoria"". Primal utterances dance circles around distorted, intergalactic synth beats. Kauffman takes a beguiling taunt (""You’re no good, baby!""), deconstructs it, then pieces it back together repeatedly. It’s a disorienting thrill that draws out the band’s innate ingenuity. There are plenty of other high points on the album—the aching chorus of ""Billz"" is arguably Hernandez’s most addictive yet—but listening to Ava Luna play off of each others’ quirks here is intoxicating. Minimalism has never been their strong suit, and they wrestle with controlling their lawless tendencies, yet <i>Infinite House</i> doesn’t compromise the group’s hyperactive curiosity. Keeping up with it requires careful attention, though unpacking it hardly feels laborious. Just don’t expect Ava Luna to do any hand-holding for you throughout the process.</p></div>"|20453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20453-infinite-house/|7.6|Tess Duncan

The wildly disparate and disjointed solo albums he's released over the last decade-plus have been generally engaging, though occasionally laborious, explorations of the outer-bounds of guitar-based pop music. They've showcased, first and foremost, an inclination to use more abstract elements to push beyond the straightforward riffery he put forth in his more famous gig. His new project Trickfinger, a tribute to the clatter of acid house, puts Frusciante in ostensibly unfamiliar territory. But as he's included more electronic flourishes on his solo efforts, it was only a matter of time before he decided to embrace the mechanized whirr of a host of synthesizers and drum machines en masse.</p>
<p>Frusciante's self-titled full-length debut under the moniker demonstrates his grasp of the intricacies of the form. As he's proven over time with his guitar work, he has a knack for capably conjuring not just the sound, but the feeling of long-past musical eras. From even the first judders of opener ""After Below"", he taps into the stark, subdued rattle of the earliest <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp Records</a> releases. Digitalist melodies become percussive and pummeling in their mechanistic repetition, locked-groove drum programming putters along for minutes at a time. Jittery snare work and rigidly interlocking synth lines populate both that track and the record as a whole, rendering it foreboding and overcast, and affecting at times. Tracks like ""Exlam"" and ""Phurip"" are able to channel the fidgety nervousness of this <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>-indebted gridlike construction into something uniquely unsettling. If you can give yourself over to Frusciante's aural panic attacks they can be as transcendent as those of his acid house forefathers.</p>
<p>But the less overwhelming moments of <i>Trickfinger</i> suffer from a surprising anonymity. Even when his seasick <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3733-sebadoh/"">Sebadoh</a>-like exercises under his own name turned obtuse and atonal, they were still immediately identifiable as products of his warped perspective. The flatulent bass runs on ""85h"" and ""Sain"" make them recognizable as acid house tracks, but there's not much more of interest going on than capable pastiche. Without the dynamic play and overstimulation that rules elsewhere, the endless repetition of these tracks starts to cut both ways. <i>Trickfinger</i> often provokes an engaging anxiety, but when Frusciante's not pushing at the edges of the form it can lack the magic of his otherwise unapologetically experimental solo work.</p>
<p>That could have something to do with the fact that this is only Frusciante's first album-length foray into the field. When looking back on the gradual shift toward synth programming, Frusciante<a href=""http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-04-guitar-player"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> talks about these efforts</a> as an attempt to learn the ""language"" of legendary electronic acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin"">Aphex Twin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4470-venetian-snares/"">Venetian Snares</a>. <i>Trickfinger</i> is, if nothing else, proof that he's finally fluent in that language. But it's also a reminder that Frusciante is at his best when he's jabbering away in a tongue of his own invention.</p></div>"|20478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20478-trickfinger/|5.9|Colin Joyce

There was a playfulness to his best songs which never undercut their sincere emotional power; if anything, the tossed-off lyrics enhanced that power, his irreverence contrasting starkly with the song's overwhelming emotional intensity. This was a skill he channeled from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"">R. Kelly</a>, executed in a more modern style; by the time R. Kelly released the obviously The-Dream-inspired <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ZkLIluh1M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Echo""</a> in 2010, the snake was eating his own tail, a tribute to The-Dream's ability to adapt an established dynamic to create something genuinely new.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But The-Dream spent the past five years slipping from that sweet spot of effortless transcendence: there's a sharp divide between The-Dream songs which work, and those that don't, and the latter category stacked some substantial gains over the course of the 2010s. Perhaps buying into the hype around his steadily growing stanbase and critical acclaim, he abandoned the high-pressure lottery of hits-first craftsmanship and tilted autobiographical, personal. But The-Dream is not a charismatic personality, and after he was caught cheating on his then-wife Christina Milian, he wasn't a sympathetic one either. As cruel as it sounds, perhaps it wasn't Terius his fans loved; it was his work, his melodic sense, his intuitive sensibilities and unpretentious workmanship.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Chastened, The-Dream's deft <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_PwH3Wk78w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That's My Shit""</a> is a return to that just-right poise of the serious and silly. The beat is understated, a two-tone stop-start organ tiptoeing forward on synthesized finger snaps, his protagonist's confidence underlined by the ""Yup!"" vocal interjections in the background. For the dancer, its use of space allows for a freer range of motion. The melody is equally relaxed, a barely-there nursery rhyme that taunts his target until the reassuring piano tones anchor his certainty at the chorus. But what makes ""That's My Shit"" so singular is the way The-Dream conveys an unconventional theme with emotional precision. The conviction with which he sings ""I know how to push that button, trust me y'all just fuckin'"" is funny, yet he is unafraid to let his heart show—boldly ""catching feelings.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The rest of The<i> Crown </i>EP does not thread the needle quite so gracefully. ""Prime"" is an example of one such failure: The-Dream is at his best when he isolates and emphasizes the familiar. But where ""That's My Shit"" epitomizes the bulletproof swagger of romantic confidence, ""Prime"" feels distant: Convincing a future lover of your value typically requires a bit more show-don't-tell than ""I know you think you're out of my league/ But I'm trying to tell you girl, I'm in my prime."" Even if interpreted as internal monologue, ""Prime"" suggests uncertainty and insecurity—relatable emotions, maybe, but not ones you'd sing about with pride.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In part, the misses might be a product of the format: ""All I Need"" links to ""Fruition"" like the infamous ""Yamaha""-""Nikki Part 2""-""Abyss"" triptych of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14449-love-king/""><i>Love King</i></a>, but on a 6-track record, it feels forced, his old ambitions with R&amp;B form reduced to mannerism. There's always been a certain degree of generosity to The-Dream's work, a feeling that one hook wasn't enough, that Tricky Stewart's production would be lusher and more ornamental, each record a compact snow globe of ideas and emotions. Yet closer ""Cedes Benz"" feels like a product of pressure. Each of its disparate parts—the grinding aggro opener, the menacing second act, the sensuous slow jam—feel undercooked, repetitious, combined in the hopes that no one would recognize the reheated elements interspersed throughout. It's not entirely empty of ideas, but the good ones are buried.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Fruition"" feels like the rare middleweight The-Dream track: held together entirely by a perfect guitar loop repeated as if it were a memory, an average song is redeemed by a single melody. ""All I Need"", however, almost lives up to our memory of The-Dream's earliest peaks, compelling and grandiose: it is unafraid to fail, to overreach. And in that ambition, it wrings more from the formula The-Dream approached on records like <i>Love vs. Money</i>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFhqeHkdHgU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fancy""</a>. It points to a key strength of The-Dream's songwriting. While we may never have really understood him, it was that yearning to be understood that his music so evocatively conveys: a willingness to risk embarrassment in an effort to convey human emotion through the boldest possible gestures.</p></div>"|20380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20380-crown-ep/|6.4|David Drake

It's largely conceptual, not particularly virtuosic, but it's effective for its own purposes, which, in this case, amount to inducing hypnotic focus and transmitting vague melancholy. Its main attraction is a suite of four meditative pieces for multi-tracked piano with subtle post-processing (there is also a second disc of remixes). The four pieces were originally written for a 2010 solo show at Naples' Galleria Fonti, where Gonzalez presented four short 16mm films of ballerinas dancing in front of mirrors. (The 2LP edition of the album includes all four films on a bonus DVD.) That piece, says Gonzalez, was inspired in part by a maxim from the Russian composer and spiritual teacher George Gurdjieff: ""To play scales is to become more in tune with your inner self."" That lone adage says more about the intentions of the project than any of the rest of its backstory.</p>
<p>It's not hard to draw a line from Gonzalez's new album back to<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2628-the-days-of-mars/"" target=""_blank""> <i>The </i></a><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2628-the-days-of-mars/"" target=""_blank"">Days of Mars</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2628-the-days-of-mars/"" target=""_blank""></a></i>, her 2005 album with Gavin Russom, and their assorted singles, despite the shift from synthesizers to coiled steel strings. Like that body of work, <i>In Remembrance</i> is fundamentally about lines and ways to braid them. ""I"" begins with a lonely descending figure that's vaguely reminiscent of the theme from <i>Halloween</i>—until it softens and turns inward, tangling up in a ball of contrapuntal phrases. The song, like the pieces that follow it, feels less composed than sculpted, a multi-track collage of piled-on arpeggios and cadenzas and trills. In ""II"", the left hand initially takes the lead, and the effect feels both more somber and more determined. ""III"" is the most lyrical of the set, and it's also the most obviously treated with delay; in ""IV"", she pounds away at bold, declarative chords, her foot firmly pressed down on the sustain pedal.</p>
<p>Given her emphasis on repetition, it's tempting to invoke the influence of American minimalists like Philip Glass, but <i>In Remembrance</i> doesn't have his rhythmic or tonal complexity. By design, I think, it's meant to sound unpolished; it's less about formal brilliance than the attainment of a kind of trance state. The occasional jarring dissonance recalls alternate-tuning buffs like Michael Harrison, though it's unclear whether they're intentional, the product of an unconventional tuning system, or simply the happy accident of an intemperate concert grand, astringent as a Sour Patch Kid. A closer comparison might be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19820-grouper-ruins/""><i>Ruins</i></a>, which evinced a similarly idiosyncratic approach to the instrument. But t<span>he closest precedent might be a wonderful 1996 album called <i>While</i> by the Chicago musician Thymme Jones, of Brise-Glace and Yona-Kit, made with a lone piano and a four-track cassette recorder. Like </span><i>In Remembrance</i><span>, </span><i>While</i><span> weaves together contrapuntal phrases into dense nests and thickets of sound.</span></p>
<p>The four remixes, one per piece, come from the Brooklyn producer Bryce Hackford. In keeping with the simplicity of the music, he hasn't overcomplicated his interventions. ""Remix I"" takes an eraser to the percussive side of the piano—the moment that each note is struck—and leaves only the sustain and the decay; the result is like a game of ping-pong played with dandelion tufts. ""Remix II"", with its looming kick drum and washed-out keys, recalls the heavier recordings in Wolfgang Voigt's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"" target=""_blank"">Gas</a> catalog, and the lumpy sample stabs of ""Remix IV"" faintly suggest Kompakt's Dettinger. The best of the bunch is ""Remix III"", which stretches out a right-hand trill over a spring-loaded rhythm and atonal synth bleats on loan from minimal techno innovator Robert Hood. Like Carl Craig's now-classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai1sfPKq2gk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of Gonzalez and Russom's ""Relevee"", it uses the original—just a scrap of it, but enough—as the springboard for a 10-minute-plus foray into techno at its most psychedelic. It's a testament to the strength of Gonzalez's work that she can provide the foundations for something so wild with such humble materials.</p></div>"|20429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20429-in-remembrance/|6.3|Philip Sherburne

In 2015, however, the concept of scrappy outsiders engaging with pop and dance music doesn’t carry the quixotic novelty it once did. As the boundaries between pop, indie, and alternative have blurred or disappeared over the last decade, Top 40 has become a less exclusive club. With re-tailored punk bands like Fall Out Boy and Paramore scoring pop radio play and Karmin trading their shticky YouTube covers of pop hits for hits of their own, the thought that a cheery, skateboarding keyboard-and-drums duo could play in the mainstream no longer seems at all farfetched.</p>
<p>On <i>New Glow</i>, Matt &amp; Kim meet Top 40 more than halfway. Considerably flashier than 2012’s self-recorded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17335-lightning/""><i>Lightning</i></a>, the album was brought to a sheen by several outside producers, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>’s longtime engineer Andrew Dawson and Jesse Shatkin, who co-wrote <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"">Sia</a>’s rafters-rattler ""Chandelier"" and assisted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4371-tegan-and-sara/"">Tegan and Sara</a>’s own pop makeover on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17597-heartthrob/""><i>Heartthrob</i></a>. As always, Matt &amp; Kim cartwheel through their hyper little songs with <i>Kidz Bop</i> levels of enthusiasm, and like a <i>Kidz Bop</i> compilation, <i>New Glow</i> is fixated on the sounds of now. The group’s once-chintzy canvas now includes grandiose hip-hop beats, whimsical trap appropriations, and candied dubstep drops, with occasional Auto-Tune and an air horn thrown in for color. If at times these songs sound like funhouse mirror versions of contemporary pop music, so have some of the biggest Top 40 hits of the last couple of years. ""Hey Now"" opens the album with a nod to the swing-rap circus of Baz Luhrmann’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18035-the-great-gatsby-ost/""><i>Great Gatsby</i> soundtrack</a>, while the frolicking ""Can You Blame Me"" feels as if it could give way to a Flo Rida verse at any moment.</p>
<p>Even with the top-dollar production, there’s still no mistaking <i>New Glow</i> for anything other than a Matt &amp; Kim album. Matt Johnson’s voice makes sure of that. He’s always sung in a dweeby, nasal whine, and here that voice feels more than ever like a dog whistle, a signal to the group’s core audience that, despite <i>New Glow</i>’s Top 40 flirtations, his heart still belongs to pop-punk. The same way that country stars play up their drawls when they sing crossover pop songs, lest their rural fanbase think they’ve forsaken their roots, <i>New Glow</i>’s contemporary aesthetic pushes Johnson to lean extra hard on his old, dopey vocal affectations. In the album’s most cartoonish display of overcompensation, he squawks the line ""We were too turned up!"" as if he’s snapping a pair of suspenders against his chest.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that Matt &amp; Kim don’t hold genuine affection for the pop and dance sounds they volley on <i>New Glow</i>. But if there’s cynicism in the album, it’s in the presumption that any old schmuck can toss off a great pop song with the right producer. From ""Get It"", a dance track that’s all drop and no sentiment, to ""Hoodie On"", a thin sartorial pride anthem for the Urban Outfitters set, every song here serves as evidence to the contrary. Even on the selfie-culture critique ""World Is Ending"", a rare attempt at profundity from a group that doesn’t often concern itself with deep thoughts, the lyrics feel about as considered as a homework assignment scribbled in the minutes before class. <i>New Glow</i> may be Matt &amp; Kim’s most polished album, but their songwriting has never been more amateurish.</p></div>"|20468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20468-new-glow/|4.6|Evan Rytlewski

Besides everything else, musically, the land-locked Sahelian nation never went through the same kind of cosmopolitan musical explosion that many other West African nations did in the 1960s post-independence era. Only around the turn of the century have some Nigerien artists broken into the international market, including Mamar Kassey and Tuareg groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5767-etran-finatawa/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Etran Finatawa</a> or Bombino. And now, of course, Tal National. </p>
<p>While Tal National’s 2008 sophomore album <i>A Na Waya</i> made them the most popular group in Niger, their following album and first international release <i>Kaani</i> officially established them outside the continent. Led by band leader Hamadal Issoufou Moumine and produced by Chicago-based engineer Jamie Carter, <i>Kaani</i> was a joyful barrage of traditional Hausa and Zarma vocals, soukous guitars, reggae synths, and percussion, all rolled up into a decidedly rock aesthetic. Then as now, Tal National took great pride in representing the ethnic diversity of Niger in their music and in their large rotating cast of band members. On their second-ever international release,<i> Zoy Zoy</i>, they build on <i>Kaani</i> and amplify everything to the nth degree. </p>
<p><i>Zoy Zoy</i>'s themes are as diverse as the traditions it pulls from. On ""Sey Wata Gaya"", for example, Tal National sing about refuting ongoing Islamist denouncements of their secular music. The bed of the track comprises a melismatic guitar riff repeating over and over against a Mandingue kora motif. In ""Tenere"", they sing about the violent <i>ouragan</i> (windstorm) of the Ténéré desert, a region frequented by the Tuareg. Fittingly, they cycle through a Tuareg assouf riff, which ripples mirage-like over hissy, subdividing hi-hats and a steady kick drum beat. The Hausa and Zarma vocals—mainly male lead vocal and female backing vocals—bound and echo across these arrangements. Altogether, these threads form a sort of tangled maze of melodic lines and jagged edges, interlocking motifs that repeat themselves like squares in a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>The music is colorful and bright and dizzying. It recalls the energy and wall-of-sound quality of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2384-konono-n1/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Konono No 1</a>, except more frenzied and texturally varied. Tal National are masters of lightning-speed time changes too, able to lock into a slower bluesy guitar solo as easily as an impromptu mbalax dance break (see ""Farila""). In spots, the group even tap into some <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ2rEj5KUgc&amp;spfreload=10"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">old school Ethiopian tizita vibes</a>, but sped-up and with a hypnotic psych rock edge. </p>
<p>That hypnotic effect is nowhere more evident than in the last two tracks. ""Kodaje"" and ""Saraounia"" are dances of possession. The tracks’ namesakes are spirits (<i>genie</i> in French<i>)</i>, the former Zarma and the latter Hausa, and both can speak through those they possess. The lead vocalist sings himself into a fever pitch, chanting and grunting and careening—this is the distilled version of the energy that propels the entire album. And it’s this energy that holds <i>Zoy Zoy</i> together, whether they be singing about fundamentalist pushback, the desert, or women.</p>
<p>Tal National’s ability to weave together all these thematic and musical elements with unflagging speed and energy is breathtaking. But it can also feel claustrophobic at times, especially when listening the whole way through and with headphones on. The two or three different polyrhythmic guitar lines present on every track are more or less split between the left and right channels. So to those raised on Western music, it can feel like getting caught between multiple conversations—albeit interesting ones. Listening through speakers, on the other hand, opens up another dimension of the album—you can visualize where the artists are positioned as they play. The artists’ emerge spatially before the listener, as if performing live, and Tal National are, first and foremost, a live band. They are the <i>ouragan</i> that they sing of—a thing hardly containable in the space of mere megabytes.</p></div>"|20392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20392-zoy-zoy/|7.2|Minna Zhou

But after that project became a real band and then similarly dispersed last year, Cohen decided to release music under his given name for the first time. Though he plays just about all the instruments on <i>Cool It</i>, the sound is right in line with those two Yellowbirds releases. Gone are vestiges of the rootsiness Apollo Sunshine incorporated in early albums and the kitchen-sink aesthetic the band explored on parting shot <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12232-shall-noise-upon/""><i>Shall Noise Upon</i></a>. With Yellowbirds and now this solo release, Cohen has settled comfortably into vintage, sunny psychedelia.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Cohen frequently lends his guitar skills to other artists (Bob Weir, Cee-Lo), so it’s not surprising that his six-string work steals the show here. Subtle synth washes provide atmosphere, but it’s the guitars—whether chiming, fuzzy, or processed to sound like a synthesizer—that supply the hooks and textures. Meanwhile, Cohen’s steady voice—like an American Lennon with some Dylan affectations—keeps it all casual. He’s content to let his music float by breezily, radiating warm and pleasant vibes. There’s always been a certain nonchalance to Cohen’s presence on record, and the chill-out feelings here are as chill as ever. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">That comfy passivity lines up with Cohen’s songwriting. A song about mountains becomes less about climbing and more of an ode to inaction on leadoff track, ""Let the Mountain Come to You"". And ""Midnight Conqueror"", despite the emboldened title, is actually about how it’s OK to go to bed angry or worried or indecisive. ""Sleep on it, baby,"" Cohen sings. ""Wait for the morning, let the night decide."" Even when he’s down and out, Cohen takes it all in stride. ""Right now I feel lonely… but pretty soon I’ll be in love again,"" he sings on ""Last Dream"". </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Not that there’s no struggle. The songs convey a sense of yearning for some alternate reality or paradisiacal afterlife—a place where ""trees don’t shake their heads in sorrow and nobody shakes in fear when they think about tomorrow."" That longing is key to the record. It’s what makes you realize Cohen cares about what he’s singing and that he wants something more, even if, on the surface, it doesn’t look like much is going on. On closing track ""El Dorado"", the sky turns red and rains for 100 years, but in Cohen’s mind, this is no Michael Bay movie. ""No one’s saying shit, it’s quieted down,"" he sings, ""and the gate’s wide open.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">While there’s rarely an inopportune time to put on a record that can transport you to a hazy weekend afternoon in the summer, Cohen’s consistency veers into predictability. <i>Cool It</i><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> is psychedelic, but it lacks the trippy surprises that the signifier implies. The most unexpected and memorable moments come from ""The Garden"", a bass-led groove that begins with Cohen standing in a garden, waiting for the rain. It’s a Friday, and he’s drinking a few beers (""beeeeeeers,"" his most Dylan-esque moment) while his band rehearses for a Sunday gig, the same one they’ve played for the past six years: ""We practice in a two-car garage, smoke around the kids."" Cohen sings of the children inhaling the adults’ fumes (""They’re gonna learn it someday""), then follows it up with the ultimate Sam Cohen existential shrug: ""If someday ever is.""</span></span></p></div>"|20401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20401-cool-it/|6.1|Joel Oliphint

His label boss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> is more successful and more readily meme-able, and there are plenty of rappers who are younger and/or more stereotypically ""youthful,"" but no one can match Makonnen’s omnivorousness, his openness, his sense of possibility. He’s a product of the Internet and incredible tragedy: A witness to the accidental death of his best friend at age 18, he spent seven years bouncing between jail, house arrest, and probationary purgatory. The online world served as a safe haven, a place for therapy and creative expression. He posted songs on Myspace, interviewed musicians and businesspeople on his personal blog, wrote and sang and drew and designed. His probation finally ended in May 2014; three months later, the most popular rapper in the world had hopped onto one of his songs.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s easy for young people to see themselves in Makonnen because many of them grew up spending their nights the same way: devouring every bit of culture in sight whether it’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers/"">the Killers</a>’ greatest hits or old episodes of ""Dragon Ball Z"", drowning themselves in tabs they never get around to reading. A few clicks away from some kind of fame, whether it’s 15 minutes on Twitter or a top 15 hit on the Billboard charts: that’s life if you came of age on the Internet, and Makonnen’s no different.</p>
<p>That’s not to suggest that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17041-ilovemakonnen-club-goin-up-on-a-tuesday-ft-drake/"">""Tuesday""</a> was a fluke, or a product of sheer coincidence rather than talent or hard work. It became a hit because of Makonnen’s genial nature, his oddball charisma, and his ability to craft a perfect, simple hook, something that stood out even when he was churning out Bandcamp tapes of basement pop that sounded more like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> than anything out of OVO’s shadowy, hyper-lean catalogue. You can hear it in the early versions of songs like ""I Don’t Sell Molly No More"" and ""Whip It"", in arrangements that are raw but ooze melody. Self-produced until 2013, his work took an immediate leap forward when he began working with outside producers on 2014 mixtape <i>Drink More Water 4</i>. Played against strange, vaguely gothic beats with real momentum and heft rather than the plinky, tinny sounds of his keyboard, Makonnen's own strangeness and versatility was amplified: his workmanlike relationship with drugs and alcohol, his wobbly vocal takes, the way he doodles arrhythmically like a kid coloring with the wrong hand. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19774-ilovemakonnen-ilovemakonnen-ep/""><i>iLoveMakonnen</i> EP</a>, released later that year (and again, with a slightly adjusted tracklist, a little later still), took that new formula and refined it further.</p>
<p><i>Drink More Water 5</i> is the first tape he's released since ""Tuesday"" rocketed him to minor fame, and so it's unsurprising that it's starrier and more polished than anything else in the series. But it also serves to illustrate a point you could've made at any point in the last few years: Makonnen songs are inherently risky propositions, destined to become impossibly sticky earworms or blatant failures with no intermediate outcomes in sight. Put another way, he's not interested in hitting singles or doubles: every swing is either a home run or a flagrant, wild strikeout. In ""Tuesday"" and ""I Don't Sell Molly No More""—and his verse on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32490-father/"">Father</a>'s louche breakout single ""Look at Wrist"", a sing-song transmission from another dimension—he managed the former, and <i>DMW5</i> has a few of its own, particularly the songs that feature other, more conventional rappers.</p>
<p>In the same way Makonnen took a step forward when he emerged from his DIY cocoon to work with other producers, he's a powerful complementary force, whether he's singing hooks or delivering verses alongside rappers who are tonally different. On the remixed version of ""Whip It"", he's a welcome burst of color against the hyperkinetic human fireworks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>; on ""No Ma'am"" and the remix of his earlier ""Dodging 12"", his melancholy spills over the edges of harder-edged, more aggressive drug rapping.</p>
<p>Songs like this are exceptions to the rule on <i>DMW5</i>. Much of the tape's remainder—and the solo Makonnen tracks in particular—are almost tuneless, sketches that are shroomy and distant rather than focused and catchy. Some, like the dewy ""Super Clean"" or ""Other Guys"", sound like they bubbled up from the minds of producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"">James Ferraro</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30721-daniel-lopatin/"">Daniel Lopatin</a> c. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/""><i>Replica</i></a>; others still, like stark confessional ""Get Loose With Me"", are an inch away from the blue, piano-pounding work of Spencer Krug's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28467-moonface/"">Moonface</a>. Makonnen is not a particularly skillful singer or lyricist, so these songs are dependent on qualities that are a little more unpredictable or intangible: emotional rawness, amateurish intimacy, a stray line or melodic phrase happening to click into place.</p>
<p>Beyond its value as a standalone release, <i>DMW5</i> invites larger questions about Makonnen's future as a mainstream star and the cap on his commercial potential. He's planning to release his major label debut later this year, and as the first member of OVO to come from outside of Drake's Toronto cabal, there's a lot of hope being placed on his ability to keep cobbling hooks together, like someone taking handfuls of spare parts and building capable sedans out of them. Can he crack down and deliver an album chock-full of heat rocks like ""Tuesday""? It's within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>But it seems much more likely that he'll follow in the footsteps of his greatest influence, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">BasedGod</a>: operating from the periphery, prolific and defiant, largely unconcerned with structure or melody or convention, opening doors for contemporaries who are more focused and/or traditionally skilled. (These doors don't have to be musical, either; consider Makonnen's fluid, nuanced response to questions about his sexuality in this <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/arts/music/ilovemakonnen-is-big-online-and-almost-famous.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>New York Times</i> profile</a>.) In the meantime we're left with tapes like this, floating in the ether, being asked to accomplish things their creator doesn't seem all that interested in pursuing.</p></div>"|20473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20473-drink-more-water-5/|6.7|Jamieson Cox

When Mac McCaughan declared, ""I think I’m hyper enough as it is"" on the album’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba44JRAjpV4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">opening salvo</a>, the statement functioned as both a readymade bumper-sticker slogan for Superchunk’s patented pogo-pop, and an admission of fatigue, signalling the refinement process that would play out over the band’s subsequent, pre-hiatus discography. Not coincidentally, around the same time, McCaughan promoted his solo project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3373-portastatic/"">Portastatic</a> from scrappy, sporadic pursuit to an equally prolific going concern, allowing him to not just quiet down, but branch out and explore sounds—easy-listening pop, Tropicalia, jazz, incidental soundtrack music, Prefab Sprout covers—that even a mellowing Superchunk wouldn’t accommodate.</p>
<p>Just as Superchunk sat out the 2000s—partly because their <a href=""https://www.mergerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merge Records</a> imprint had transformed from beloved indie label to <a href=""http://www.spin.com/2013/08/superchunk-merge-records-durham-north-carolina/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">job-generating local-economy savior</a>—Portastatic would likewise fall silent after 2006’s <i>Be Still Please</i>, its transformation from home-recording free-for-all to dignified, studio-smoothed art-pop outfit seemingly complete. But now that Superchunk have re-emerged this decade with two <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14642-majesty-shredding/"">well-received</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18365-superchunk-i-hate-music/"">return-to-form</a> albums, McCaughan finds himself in the same position as he was 20 years ago—eager to assert his lyrical voice without the risk of being overpowered by his primary band’s guitar roar. But this time, he’s not hiding behind a self-deprecating alias—with <i>Non-Believers</i>, he taps into a deeply personal, wistfully reflective mode of storytelling that demands putting his own name on the marquee for the first time in his 25-year career.</p>
<p>This album could have easily been titled <i>Here’s Where the Synths Come In</i>: though McCaughan is no stranger to keyboards, their use here is more dramatically purposeful than the textural shading they provided throughout the Portastatic catalogue, and inextricably intertwined with <i>Non-Believers</i>’ thematic framework. This is an album about growing up in and out of punk, its small-scaled but vigorous sound emblematic of the music’s transition into mechanistic New Wave at the dawn of the '80s (when synths essentially became the punk equivalent of hiring a string section). But while the bright, buzzy, fuzzy tones are redolent of a bygone era when these machines really sounded like the future, McCaughan’s vivid lyrical vignettes ground us in the sobering everyday scenes—as the celestial ballad ""Mystery Flu"" blossoms, he’s pondering ""the stripe of paint on pavement, the seam in cement, an easement to our coming loss"" like someone’s who’s spent far too many late nights on the interstate en route to another $50 gig.</p>
<p>Throughout McCaughan’s career, the lines separating his artistic, professional, and personal lives have been routinely blurred, so it’s fitting that the songs on <i>Non-Believers</i> double as pledges of romantic commitment and DIY self-sufficiency: The exultant chorus of ""Only Do""—""there is no try/ there is only do""—is both an invitation to elope and an epitaph-worthy summation of McCaughan’s work ethic. Lyrically, McCaughan’s following in the footsteps of elders who aged gracefully out of punk before him, whether channelling the rich observational detail of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">the Go-Betweens</a> on the high-school house-party reminiscences of ""Your Hologram"" or the hard-scrabble wisdom of latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4576-paul-westerberg/"">Paul Westerberg</a> on ""Our Way Free"" (a galloping, gently ascendent anthem that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire"">Arcade Fire</a> should really select as their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56184-arcade-fire-cover-dead-kennedys-california-uber-alles/"">local-hero cover-song tribute</a> the next time they roll through Durham).</p>
<p>Like those forebears, McCaughan has a gift for capturing simple, affecting moments without tipping the scales to sentimentality. Even the sleek dream-pop R&amp;B groove and smooth harmony hooks of ""Real Darkness"" are undercut by a despairing account of locked-in-the-bathroom teenage depression; ""family friends and strangers lift your chin and go, ‘smile kid’,"" McCaughan sings, but the ache radiating from his falsetto suggests such well-meaning platitudes only hasten the downward spiral.</p>
<p>But as much as <i>Non-Believers</i> mines memories of McCaughan’s formative years—be it the blown-out ghetto-blaster-fetishism of ""Box Batteries"" or the sight of ""an '82 Honda getting its tapes stolen"" on ""Your Hologram""—it’s ultimately a portrait of his current condition, and how all those young-punk passions and problems made him the confident, principled, and industrious man he is today. On the latter song, he says, ""I’ll be down in the basement/ I’ll be winding up wires,"" like an indie-rock lifer who’s got a permanent burn mark above his elbow from decades of spooling guitar cables around his arm at load-out. It’s a line he could’ve written when he was 15—and it sounds just as meaningful and virtuous on the cusp of 50.</p></div>"|20474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20474-non-believers/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Hot on the heels of January's excellent <i>Boogalou Reed</i>, <i>Know America</i> prents another stunning collection of blown-out, catchy, soulful garage rock. It is hardly a departure for Thomas, but it also shows growth – with each release Thomas’ stature and legend grows.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lamont has said that <i>Know America</i> is<a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/obnox-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a punk rock concept album about taking over a record station and playing his friends' records</a>, and the album boasts an appropriately joyous, ferocious energy. The pleasure of belonging to a community where your friends are your competition, your inspiration, and your favorite musicians is one of the best things about being part of any kind of DIY music scene, and <i>Know America</i> crackles with that communal glee.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> Under all the noise, he’s never forgotten the value of hooks or honesty: “Menocause”, the album’s first single, is a gospel-psych plea that rambles through heartache, not seeking salvation or resolution but simply honoring feelings that can’t be shoved down any longer. Contrast that with “Freaky”, a delightful, uncompromisingly sexual trashpile that sounds like the brash punk son of Funkadelic’s noisiest moments. They are part and parcel of the same human experience – desire, longing – and Thomas handles the whole range with a pop songwriter's ease.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Thomas has sat in the drummer’s seat for years for Cleveland outfits like Bassholes and This Moment in Black History, and he is also an excellent guitarist who knows when to pull out a short, searing solo and when to lean back. The constant, menacing guitar fuzz that runs throughout, occasionally swelling up and nearly overwhelming a song, is the glue welding together the disparate styles that make up Thomas’ distinct voice. He’s a singer with a lovely tone first made evident by </span><i>Louder Space</i><span>, his first record as Obnox in a proper studio, but he still knows how to manipulate and highlight rhythm. “Loudpack”, at the center of the track list, is a monster of a percussive noise track.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The goofiest moment on the record – “Hillbilly Intervention”, where Thomas pretends to be an ignorant bumpkin calling into the radio station to protest “Obnox and that whole n****r-ish punk movement” – is also the most serious. There is a  a tendency both within rock subgenre scenes and within criticism to cast rock as by and for white people, an ahistorical erasure Thomas refuses. His blackness is, of course, part of who he is, and he refuses to compromise any aspect of himself.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you somehow haven’t been paying attention to Thomas before this, hopefully </span><i>Know America</i><span> will rectify that situation. (If you get a chance to see him live, take it – he puts himself into his performance in a way that is exhilarating, exhausting and always worthwhile.) His music is alive in a way few records are these days – complex, emotional, and political in a way that resists sloganeering and cuts to the quick of what matters.</span></p></div>"|20402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20402-know-america/|7.9|Jes Skolnik

The </span>sample-heavy local producer is one half of the duo Retro Su$h! and a member of the alt rap collective <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32792-two-9/"">Two-9</a>, which has been bubbling in the underground scene for the last few years. The latter make trap music with nuance, but CEEJ has always been the most eclectic of the bunch, warping and chopping samples into genre-bending artifacts. As a pair, Rome Fortune and CEEJ are a perfect stylistic marriage unified by similar interests and tendencies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The duo’s latest joint mixtape, <i>loloU</i>, is the sequel to 2012’s <i>LOLO</i>; when comparing the two tapes, it's clear that Fortune has come a long way over three years. He's grown into a dextrous rapper, one no longer restricted by monotonous cadence, with a voice and flow that fit the nooks and crannies of productions across the musical spectrum. And he's moved from trap beats by Dun Deal and Childish Major to more impressionistic productions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32418-suicideyear/"">Suicideyear</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5378-bassnectar/"">Bassnectar</a> without a hitch—the wider his range gets, the more comfortable he becomes filling the pockets. On <i>loloU</i>, his role is to keep the unchanging CEEJ productions from getting repetitive, but sometimes he ends up drawing attention to himself for the wrong reasons. For every nimble flow there’s a bar like ""like soda, shake it up, I’ll spray it on ya.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At times, CEEJ’s lush, meticulously-selected productions work almost in spite of Fortune—the samples themselves do much of the communicating, and CEEJ is a master at presenting them. Sometimes (""lolo blUez"", ""cocaine fUtUre""), he lays out elements like strips on a spool of film, cutting and pasting them back together at the seams, and sometimes he chops them finely, allowing the ends to bleed into one another. When at his best, CEEJ finds the uninhabited space where genres meet. ""trials and tribUlations"", which draws from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTbBf1996dk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tortured Soul’s ""Fall in Love""</a>, reinterprets the original intro and distorts its vocals into a soulful epilogue.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When CEEJ's best overlaps with Fortune's best, you get ""take me away"", a rap ballad in a minor key that features a chorus with some of Makonnen’s richest falsetto. The dark, thundering chords leave space for Fortune's choppy flow to roll through, bridging the gaps. The pair meshes well in other instances, too, like ""blacktop"", where CEEJ and co-producer Kye Ricks flip a sample twice with contrasting tones and the rapper matches each mood. On ""blacktop"", also assisted by Makonnen, Fortune plays the placeholder perfectly, delivering brief verses that are closer to bridges over a gorgeous arrangement that carries most of the weight. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Chances"", a song about Fortune's willingness to push boundaries, serves as a sort of mission statement: ""Head down, work hard, get your damn crown."" But keeping your head down and being willing to take chances are conflicting ideals, and Fortune sometimes has trouble navigating that gap.</p></div>"|20406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20406-lolou/|6.2|Sheldon Pearce

As opening lines go, it’s hard to get more direct than that. It’s fitting then that the song itself is called ""Courage""—a phenomenon that the Villagers’ frontman describes as ""a feeling like no other, let me tell you."" The song is a kind of pat on the back for O’Brien but also a way of steeling himself to open up and reveal what the album’s remaining songs have yet to say—namely, that romance is the pits no matter who you happen to fall in love with, but romantic love is not nearly as hard as coming to terms with your own mysterious and complicated self.</p>
<p>Previous Villagers records—2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14322-becoming-a-jackal/""><i>Becoming a Jackal</i></a> and 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17509-awayland/"">{Awayland}</a>—</i>were much busier affairs, each Mercury Prize nominees in which O’Brien’s grandly orchestral and electronic-infused folk music is supported by a full band and a preponderance of big ideas. <i>Darling Arithmeti</i>c, by contrast, is a radically subdued affair—nine mostly acoustic-based tracks that O’Brien recorded at home alone, playing every instrument and mixing the record on his own. It makes sense then that the record is also the most strikingly personal he’s ever made—an emotional missive about love and relationships—in which the notoriously shy Dubliner finally opens up in a more direct way about his own sexuality.</p>
<p>Earlier this year O’Brien <a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/villagers-conor-o-brien-i-kind-of-realised-i-was-not-a-rock-star-1.2162717"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spoke</a> to the <i>Irish Times</i> about the motivations for his new record by saying, ""It’s not a news story: ‘Man is gay.’ I don’t want that to be the main focus. I wanted the album to be a human love album because everyone in the world feels those emotions at some stage. I really wanted to make sure that anyone who was listening could relate to the songs. I didn’t want to cut anyone off or make it seem as if I was only singing to my younger self.""</p>
<p>While O’Brien’s goal of speaking to the universal experience—rather than simply making what could be ostensibly pigeonholed as a specifically ""coming out"" record—is understandable, his lingering reticence leaves some of the material wanting. Tracks like ""Dawning on Me"" and ""No One to Blame"" are undeniably pretty—understated bits of finely distilled yearning—but they suffer from an intentional vagueness, the genderless and pronoun-free lyrics occasionally treading a fine line between charmingly sweet and frustratingly precious (""Excuse me while I die/ A million times before I meet your eyes with mine"").</p>
<p>For an album of mostly acoustic singer/songwriter fare released only weeks after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a>’ stunning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20218-carrie-lowell/""><i>Carrie &amp; Lowell</i></a>, the simple loveliness of <i>Darling Arithmetic</i> doesn’t always feel like quite enough. O'Brien is a deft songwriter with a wonderfully emotive voice, but it’s only when his lyrics become more pointed—as they do on ""Little Bigot""—that the record soars. Addressing a sort of of everyman asshole, O’Brien advises his would-be hater by singing that ""It’s okay to be tired/ So take the blame, little bigot/ And throw that hatred onto the fire."" Elsewhere, on ""Hot Scary Summer"", he charmingly recollects a lost love—""Remember kissing on the cobblestone/ In the heat of the night/ And all the pretty young homophobes/ Looking out for a fight""—before getting to the real heart of the matter: ""We got good at pretending/ Then pretending got us good."" For anyone who might have spent years grappling with their own idenity—or logged countless hours loving the one who didn't quite love them back the right way—the song hits every perfect bittersweet note.</p>
<p>The need to stop pretending—to admitting one’s deepest insecurities and wants—seems central to <i>Darling Arithmetic</i>, an album that delivers a gorgeous, if somewhat restrained, step forward. It’s a document of quiet, if not necessarily earth-shattering, revelations. ""In the darkness and the light/ I give you every side,"" O’Brien sings at one point, in what seems as much a promise to a lover as to the listener. Regardless of whether or not O’Brien chooses to go further down the troubadour path of working solo or will fall back into a full band scenario, one can only hope that making this record has proven to be a kind of emotional throat-clearing, a way of moving into potentially murkier and possibly even more personal waters. ""How did I get here?/ Am I ever gonna get back?"" he asks on the album-closing ""So Naïve"" as if revealing oneself so fully has stranded him in uncharted territory. That needn’t be a bad thing though. Previous Villagers records too often felt like puzzles—layers of densely-packed metaphors that, when unraveled, didn’t always add up to much. If <i>Darling Arithmetic</i> is the sound of someone dipping their toes into the waters and finding it to their liking, then perhaps the next Villagers record will be the sound of O’Brien diving in headfirst—even more fearlessly himself.</p></div>"|20393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20393-darling-arithmetic/|7.0|T.

That blend of reliable comedy tropes can drive inspiration for a long time, and when Tom Scharpling announced in 2013 that ""The Best Show on WFMU"" was coming to an end, the general consensus was that it was going out on top. Scharpling's alternately cranky and enthusiastic rapport with his callers and the inspired regular-Joe insight of the monologues woven in with them demonstrated his mastery of the radio comedy format, while the extended bits Scharpling did with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3998-superchunk/"">Superchunk</a> drummer and top-flight weirdo Jon Wurster made it the stuff of legend. This was the kind of phenomenon that sustained a more-or-less-weekly show over 12-plus years, which means their ""greatest hits"" collection is a sixteen-disc, 20-plus hour box set—with a bonus USB stick that includes another 4 ¾-hours' worth of material—that still could be described as ""scraping the surface.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That's a lot of mileage to get out of just two people, though the trick is that these people actually represent multitudes. Wurster's weirdly sympathetic call-in characters, co-created and co-written with Scharpling, are exercises in gradual-reveal lunacy that ramp up a conversation until both Scharpling and the listener are left repeating Wurster's ludicrous claims (""you are two inches tall"") and malaprops (""laser beans"") with a bewildered disbelief. Over the course of a call that can stretch past the 20- or 30-minute mark, a friendly conversation mutates into a series of escalating threats, an arrogant display of untouchability that eventually crumbles to reveal the hapless loser beneath, or, as the origin-point ""Rock, Rot &amp; Rule"" perfectly revealed, a self-proclaimed expert revealing just how arbitrary and flimsy his knowledge really is. It's comedy that breaks down just how funny it can be to hear somebody with way too much self-confidence obliviously dig his own grave.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's a cult phenomenon, but nothing about <i>The Best of the Best Show</i> feels closed off or for-fans-only, even given an overstuffed deluxe-package treatment that feels aimed directly at the diehards. The diehards might even find an excuse or two to gripe about omissions (where's ""The Chippert Report"" and its daring exposé of Davenport, Iowa's ""toilet rock"" scene?), but what's included is definitive and varied enough to draw in both entry-level listeners and longtime fans who snapped up all their previous collections on Stereolaffs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course there are usual suspects and recurring characters. New Jersey-defaming hoagie enthusiast Philly Boy Roy details his family's felonious Memorial Day exploits, battles post-Eagles playoff loss depression, and gets his wife to call in to reveal just how obsessed he is with Scharpling. The aimless, low-energy Pudge gets a few laughs as the call-in regular who has literally nothing to say short of ""I'unno."" And even with his central conceit basically being ""hippie Deadhead who takes bong rips mid-call,"" Wurster's giggly, wheezy-falsetto performances as Bryce and his rapport with the aggravated-yet patient Scharpling elevate a concept that other comedy acts would make into a one-dimensional caricature.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Couple these regulars with a few of the show's most notorious calls, including the first appearance by Fonzie inspiration/violent elderly sociopath Roland ""The Gorch"" Gorchnik and the introduction of splatter-flick auteur Trent L. Strauss (famed for <i>The Tool Belt Killer</i>, <i>The Hacksawist</i>, and <i>Art School Arson</i>), and you've got a strong cross-section of what makes the ""Best Show"" canon so beloved. When Wurster gathers more than a dozen of his most popular characters together in an hour-and-a-half panel discussion for Newbridge's highest office during 2008's ""Mayubinatorial Debate"", hearing him inhabit all these different characters in close quarters—Roy, Pudge, monstrously obese barbershop singer Zachary Brimstead, legendary drummer/erotic fiction author Marky Ramone—is pretty astounding. It's worldbuilding of a kind you don't often get from two people in any medium—and they did it pretty much pro bono.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A lot of Scharpling and Wurster's appeal rides on a certain sort of deep-knowledge obsession with the absurd minutiae of popular music and the people that take it extra-seriously. ""Rock, Rot &amp; Rule"" came in the middle of one of Scharpling's pre-""Best Show"" airings and provoked angry fans to call in to object to the rankings of Wurster's know-it-some musicologist Ronald Thomas Clontle. Wannabe rock stars who have unrealistic dreams of making it (""Count Rockula"", whose own box-set vision is trashed by notable music website shovel.com) share space with rock stars who have unrealistic ideas of what ""making it"" entitles them to (Wurster's version of Gene Simmons has a grand old time arrogantly auditioning the actual, in-studio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2455-ted-leo/"">Ted Leo</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6926-carl-newman/"">Carl Newman</a> to be replacement members of KISS). The ""Best Show"" fandom in indie rock is well-documented, and has roped in everyone from Michael Azerrad (briefly interrogated by Wurster on the air as to why Wire Train weren't included in <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>) to Damian Abraham (who became an evangelical enthusiast of the show and broke the ice on tour with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a> by swapping Philly Boy Roy anecdotes).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You get a ridiculous amount of stuff with this box set, sure: all that audio content, plus a book featuring some great essays by the aforementioned Abraham, comedian Julie Klausner, and call screener A.P. Mike, an extensive interview on the show's origins and developments with Jake Fogelnest, photos of archival material (including crib sheets Wurster used for some of the calls); and illustrations by longtime show-associated cartoonists Neil Numberman and Casey Burns. But what you're really buying, whether you're new to the world of Scharpling and Wurster or a Friend of Tom from back in the day, is an acknowledgement of a hard-won, rightly-earned cult. It's an in-group that always has more room for anyone willing to forge a deep connection with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-2E-X0RVYM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">town that's comin' to get ya</a>. And it can't be stopped—even Scharpling's 2013 farewell turned out to be a hiatus instead, and ""The Best Show"" continues to this day as an Internet show delving deep into the one of the biggest, strangest, best worlds in comedy. There's more—way more—where this box set came from, and this collection is a prime reminder of why we're lucky that it's not slowing down anytime soon.</p></div>"|20203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20203-scharpling-and-wurster-the-best-of-the-best-show/|8.8|Nate Patrin

The New Orleans native tours regularly and continues to release quality projects like last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19131-curreny-the-drive-in-theatre/""><span><i>The Drive In Theater</i></span></a>, 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17761-curreny-new-jet-city/""><i>New Jet City</i></a>, and 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"">Alchemist</a> joint-effort, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15385-covert-coup/""><i>Covert Coup</i></a>, but hasn’t been able to duplicate the bite of his 2010 breakthroughs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14474-pilot-talk/""><i>Pilot Talk</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14906-pilot-talk-ii/""><i>Pilot Talk II</i></a>. News of the third installation’s arrival sparked more interest than he'd enjoyed in awhile, as those outside of his core fanbase were curious to see if the next volume would do the series justice. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Curren$y is a bit of a cinephile, and treats each individual work like a grand production; it’s evident in the titles of his projects (see his 2012 tribute, </span><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Curreny-Priest-Andretti-mixtape.410830.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Priest Andretti</i></a><span>), and </span><span><i>Pilot Talk III</i> </span><span>begins with ""Opening Credits"", where he strolls over an authoritative soul sample like Max Julien in </span><i>The Mack</i><span>. For just over two minutes, he reflects on his career’s trajectory: ""It was right around the time/ I thought I’d have to move back with my mom/ I had to sell my first low-rider/ Halfway to the top went to sleep, woke up at the bottom."" The hopscotch path Curren$y has taken to success (from No Limit, to Cash Money, to independent juggernaut) is well-documented, but he rarely deviates from his cool-guy persona to reflect on his struggles.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Curren$y remains as irreverent as always, but he sounds more focused on <i>Pilot Talk III</i> than he has in awhile. The ominous ""Cargo Planes"", produced by Joey Fatts, sounds like the opening of a cinematic crime saga, but in this case it's a typical Spitta infraction: the theft of someone else’s girlfriend.

On ""Froze"", eccentric jester <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30571-riff-raff/"">RiFF RAFF</a> appears like the ghastly clown from <i>Spawn</i> to exchange swank over Harry Fraud’s slow-burn production, and Curren$y keeps his cool.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Although Spitta's range is limited, it’s never been a disadvantage; he’s a purveyor of lifestyle rap. His song titles, often named after random, inanimate objects or people (in the past we've gotten ""Chandelier"", ""Breakfast"", and ""Scottie Pippen"", and here we have ""Pot Jar,"" ""Briefcase"", ""Lemonade Mimosas"") testify his ability to find something worthy of appreciation in the seemingly ordinary. O</span>n ""Long as the Lord Say"", he sketches familiar imagery: ""Plottin’ like always/ Marble floor hallways/ Smoked out all day/ Tryin’ to get more paid."" His lyrics are like an ad from a men’s magazine targeting the 18 to 25 age demographic in real time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Because Curren$y himself is a control variable, production typically influences the quality of his output. Ski Beatz, who produced the bulk of the original <i>Pilot Talk</i> and its sequel, has left his imprint on everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay Z</a>’s <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5516-camp-lo/"">Camp Lo</a>’s <i>Uptown Saturday Night</i>. Noticeably absent from Curren$y’s discography following <i>Pilot Talk II</i>, it’s Ski's presence that makes <i>Pilot Talk III</i> so strong. The shimmering crash of the cymbals and pop of the drums on ""Alert"" are vintage Ski and very welcome.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-0b272ab4-9ed6-2101-6e3d-d609388c31cc"">Curren$y may not do ""new,"" but he is very good at what he does: riffing on cars, money, women, weed, and obscure moments from television shows. It’s difficult for the third version of something to truly reign supreme, especially when there’s little variation differentiating them. ""Audio Dope 5"" is solid, but nowhere near as experimental as the intoxicated stumble of ""Audio Dope II"".

The French composer’s three 19th-century piano works serve as an introduction to one kind of minimalism—maximum emotion created with the fewest ingredients—and they show what can happen when you have the right note in the right place at the right time. The formal elegance of the pieces, along with the underlying sense of yearning and clear surface beauty, have made them a natural fit for advertising and film, and the <i>Gymnopédies</i> long ago became ubiquitous, their structure a sort of auditory cliché. But even with the overexposure, the power of Satie’s pieces are still there inside of us, guiding how we respond to simple piano music that leaves a lot of space. Whenever contemporary composers—from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7569-gonzales/"">Chilly Gonzales</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1334-eluvium/"">Eluvium</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/"">Jandek</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin"">Aphex Twin</a>—use a piano in this way, they tap into these buried associations.</p>
<p>German composer and producer Nils Frahm’s most recent full-length, his fine 2013 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28863-nils-frahm/""><i>Spaces</i></a>, featured plenty of piano but found him putting the instrument into a number of different contexts and adding electronics (the set also included live tracks). But among the earliest works of his career were two albums of solo piano work, and he returns here with a third, an album he gave away free on <a href=""https://twitter.com/nilsfrahm/status/581954409359400960"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> two weeks ago. <i>Solo</i> is almost exactly what you might expect from a record like this one; it’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough.</p>
<p>Sometimes solo piano albums can get too sentimental, and can begin to sound like bad TV cues; sometimes they can be a little dry and academic, and can come over like an instrumental exercise. This one mostly fits into ""just right"" territory, balancing general loveliness with space and suggestion. Frahm's piano is creaky and there's a percussive tone coursing through some of these tracks, an extra ""pling"" that marks time with every keystroke. That extra texture gives a piece like ""Merry"" a tiny bit of grit to offset a gorgeous melody that might otherwise be overbearing, and gives the more downcast ""Some"" an extra ounce of dark weight. During its best moments <i>Solo</i> brings to mind some of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JwmBE8zg44"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lower-stakes work of Harold Budd</a>, where melody and mood become two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>The album’s second half finds Frahm playing more with form, but oddly the variety, rather than being welcome, actually breaks the spell of the album’s first half. ""Wall"" is a loud, pulsing piece that is interesting enough on its own but derails the album’s gentle mood, while ""Immerse!"" leans toward meandering abstraction, foregoing melody and in no way justifying its almost 11-minute length. Still, for a free album that sounds very nice in a room, <i>Solo</i> mostly delivers, tapping into that very specific identification with the solo piano as an expression of wistful sadness.</p></div>"|20471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20471-solo/|7.3|Mark Richardson

The former is an archetypal indie rock band—four white guys in standard guitar/bass/synth/drums formation, belonging to a distinctly Western tradition of dystopian art-punk. The latter is the multimedia recording project of Radwan Ghazi Moumneh, a producer of Lebanese descent refracting traditional Middle Eastern music through a modernist, avant-garde lens (right down to the numerically dense song titles that reflect Arabic text-speak for sounds not represented by English characters). Suuns release albums through populist indie labels like <a href=""http://www.secretcityrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Secret City</a> (in Canada) and <a href=""http://www.secretlycanadian.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Secretly Canadian</a> (in the United States) and have reached the ""what the fuck, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4dXpjzs14g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">we’ll do a Nike commercial</a>"" stage of their careers. Moumneh records for the defiantly non-conformist <a href=""http://cstrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Constellation</a> label, and works as a sound engineer, producer and co-owner at the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed</a>-affiliated Hotel2Tango studio. Suuns thrive on structural linearity and rhythmic precision; Jerusalem in My Heart demonstrates what you can do when you completely disavow both.</p>
<p>But for a city of millions of people, Montreal is a small town when it comes to Anglophone musicians with experimental leanings, and in the case of Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart, there exists not just a mutual-admiration society but a full-blown recording collaboration. The seven pieces on their jointly billed eponymous debut were actually recorded during a week-long session back in November 2012, but put on the backburner as both principals prepped their respective 2013 albums (Suuns’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17671-suuns-images-du-futur/"">Images Du Futur</a></i> and Jerusalem in My Heart’s debut, <i>Mo7it Al-Mo7it</i>). However, the extended gestation period between conception and delivery proves immaterial, because <i>Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart</i> sounds very little like the music either was making on their own at the time of its recording. The album’s success is contingent on the very fact that it never feels like a forced collision of two opposing musical approaches, but rather a natural cultivation of a shared underlying philosophy.</p>
<p>What Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart ultimately do have in common is a desired end goal of transcendence—the former’s two albums to date attempt it through lock-step grooves, synth-throbbed hypnosis, and Ben Shemie’s smeared vocalese; on <i>Mo7it Al-Mo7it</i>, the latter opted for free-form acoustic meditations, analog-electronic oscillations, and equilibrium-upsetting chants. On <i>Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart</i>, the collaborators unite Western rock convention with their ancient old-world antecedents: The appropriately clanging instrumental ""Metal"" plays like a call-and-response between a distorted Arabic melody—a distant echo of the Syrian wedding-singer boombox bootlegs that are foundational to the JIMH sound—and a mimicking fuzz-toned guitar that effectively turns it into a '60s surf riff. The glitchy and twitchy ""Seif"" relocates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a> to Beirut; the exhilarating closer ""3attam Babey"" hits pause on its whirring, motorik, synth-punk drive to accommodate Moumneh’s meditative vocal breaks, before an extended outro fuses them into the same third-eye-prying frequency.</p>
<p><i>Suuns and Jerusalem in My Heart</i> does leave you wondering what more the two entities could have accomplished had they worked on this for more than a week: the ominously intensifying clatter of ""Gazelles in Flight"" fades out just as the track seems ready to truly take off, while the incongruously off-the-cuff lullaby ""Leyla"" feels like a rough Suuns song sketch that lacks any of the collaborative frisson heard elsewhere on the record. But for both parties, the benefits of this recording experiment are obvious: For Suuns, it’s an opportunity to break out of their hermetic aesthetic and explore more open-ended modes of composition; for Moumneh, it’s a chance to forsake meticulously crafted soundscapes to indulge his love of raw punk and thumping techno. And whether they’re channeling the serene spirit of '70s krautrock or the corrosive croon of a Damascus busker, the implicit message is the same: for these two, there’s no place like drone.</p></div>"|20348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20348-suuns-and-jerusalem-in-my-heart/|7.2|Stuart Berman

His voice has a crystalline, choirboy quality, a projection of pure light, and on the cover of <i>Culture of Volume, </i>he's wearing a navy blazer with a tie clip and a tousled haircut; it could be ripped from his prep school yearbook. He performs alone, standing behind a standard setup of MacBooks, samplers and holding a bass guitar.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And yet, his East India Youth project has a distinctly intimidating air. Here is an incomplete list of the bulletproof influences he's namedropped for <i>C</i><i>ulture of Volume</i>: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno"">Brian Eno</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys"">Pet Shop Boys</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>, Andy Warhol, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>, Yellow Magic Orchestra. The album title is taken from a poem written by Eno collaborator <a href=""http://www.rjholland.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rick Holland</a>. <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/11366-east-india-youth-hostel-ep-quietus-label"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Music critics started a label for the sole purpose of releasing his first 12”</a> and <i>of course</i>, he was nominated for a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56640-mercury-prize-nominees-revealed/"">Mercury Prize</a> a year later. Coming on the heels of the idea-packed but unfocused <i>Total Strife Forever, Culture of Volume </i>is poised for a presumable ""pop"" breakout, but it still comes off as an academic pursuit, a veritable thesis on the legends of avant-garde art-pop. <i>Culture of Volume</i> doesn't just want to impress you; it wants you to behold it with chin-stroking, head-nodding awe.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At times this is the only pose even Doyle can muster towards his work. In the credits, he refers to the making of <i>Culture of Volume</i> as The Process and the first vocal track details the process of creating The Process. ""The end result is not what was in mind/ The end result is always hard to find,"" Doyle sings during ""End Result"", treating inspiration like a forensics expert. It’s preceded by a lengthy <i>Station to Station</i> homage of daunting electronic noise called ""The Juddering"". The guy likes definitive articles.</p>
<p>And so <i>Culture of Volume</i> presents itself as a record of Big Ideas and Big Statements and it sure as hell sounds big. ""Beaming White"" is the third track here, and that title about sums up the production's hyperclarity. Every drum pattern, every synth pad, every orchestral frill is a tool used to build gleaming edifices to house his spotless vocals. It sounds fantastic, which is to be expected of a record mixed by Graham Sutton. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/572-bark-psychosis"">Bark Psychosis</a> frontman has also worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5694-these-new-puritans"">These New Puritans</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/535-british-sea-power"">British Sea Power</a> and very few others; he’s not getting involved if the artist doesn’t aspire for a certain museum-ready quality. But those bands also understand the idea of art as entertainment; they’re showmen, whereas Doyle is a curator.</p>
<p>""Don’t Look Backwards"" toys with the idea of Balearic, but it's a picture of Ibiza without the partygoers, presenting a ""vague horizon set ablaze."" To convey a heightened emotional state, Doyle will say, ""At the point of passion/ I am inflamed""; it’s a rather chilly way of saying you’ve got the hots for someone. ""Entirety"" and ""Hearts That Never"" are futuristic electro-pop for dance clubs that always meet sanitation codes. And even if they are highbrow pop songs, they’re still pop songs all the same—Doyle needs to <i>sell </i>them.</p>
<p>He could one day evolve into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4644-patrick-wolf"">Patrick Wolf</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett"">Owen Pallett</a>-style auteur, but he currently lacks their capacity for theatrics, for personal revelation, for a vocal mode that conveys something other than bathos, for melodies that actually <i>pop</i>. If he’s going to try for a show-stopping, six-minute ballad, like he does on ""Carousel"", there has to be a show to stop in the first place; here, ""Carousel"" is a confession to an empty arena. The same applies to ""A Manner of Words""; Doyle asks, ""Turn this dull roar down"", and then the song goes on to serve as the record's 10-minute anticlimax. For a record so bent on impressing the listener, <i>Culture of Volume</i> somehow never manages to leave a mark.</p></div>"|20286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20286-culture-of-volume/|5.7|Ian Cohen

<p dir=""ltr"">You don’t call your record <i>White Men Are Black Men To</i>o unless you’re looking to stir up some questions about classification, and with their new album, Young Fathers double down on the confusion they inspired with their earliest releases. Their label bio even leads with the statement that the group has ""no ancestors,"" which is a funny thing to say about three men calling themselves Young Fathers because they all inherited their dads’ names. But their lineage is important, and audible: Graham ""G"" Hastings was born in Edinburgh; Alloysious Massaquoi hails from Liberia via Ghana, and Kayus Bankole was raised in the US by Nigerian parents. Young Fathers not only have ancestors but draw an enormous amount of energy from them, as <i>White Men Are Black Men Too </i>makes obvious: The record is a direct descendent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>, a grandson of krautrock, a distant relative of the earnest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3959-the-streets/"">Streets</a>, a grungy nephew of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a>. And, though it might change by the next time around, they’ve hit an unqualified category, for the first time: this is a rock record, almost a pop record. It’s raucous, messy, marked by a profound sense of urgency, intended to uplift and discomfit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Remarkably, <i>White Men Are Black Men To</i>o also addresses the questions posed by its name. The lyrics begin the conversation, but only get so far:  ""Old Rock N Roll"" starts with ""I’m tired of playing the good black/ I’m tired of having to hold back/ I’m tired of wearing this hallmark for some evils that happened way back."" Then, the speaker flips his loyalty—""I’m tired of blaming the white men/ His indiscretion don’t betray him""-—and reverses the album title: ""A black man can play him."" Then it flips back: ""Some white men are black men too, nigga to them, a gentleman to you.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The idea is jumbled, a little hollow, mostly a venting of frustration. More to the point is this simple line on ""Rain or Shine"": ""I ain’t strange enough."" And the most honest moment on the album, the moment where Young Fathers delineate their worldview the most clearly, is on the album’s standout (and most overtly TV on the Radio-soundalike) single ""Shame"", which begins with a dusty, drum-machine twinkle and rises up into a big, ragged, radio-ready melody. The chorus, self-flagellating and triumphant, switches between cries of ""It ain’t right, baby"" and ""What you do to feel better! What you do to feel good!""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But at any rate, the words are just the address on the envelope; the music is the letter itself. There is an appealing coherence in the album’s composition. Most of the tracks are built on juxtaposition between the low and high register: a vamping bass riff against a shrill glockenspiel, a dark guitar loop beneath a top cacophony of horns, synths, vocal wails. It’s a simple framework and a strong mirror to Young Fathers’ submerged cultural project: delineating a foundational reality (race, genre) and then mounting a tantrum against it. And, in the midst of this dissonance, the album’s sound is all tied together by shreds of surefooted, strong pop melody: ""27"" sounds almost like pitch-warped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"">Passion Pit</a> by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"">the Avalanches</a>, and ""Dare Me"" seems like a sweet little organ-backed ballad until it throws up a middle finger and breaks into an atonal, menacing shuffle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s not all coherent or wholly successful. Young Fathers’ people’s-mic earnestness can combine with their penchant for major-chord toplines to produce a funky but unmistakable cheese, as in ""Sirens"". Their fractious energy slants unfocused at times, too, and though the group does answer the question provoked by their album title, they do so by throwing their hands up—compacting the past like so much garbage and charging ahead. The sound of <i>White Men Are Black Men Too</i> is telling enough. It’s triumphant music for the hyperactive, plural city; it’s confrontational as a means to achieving communality, with no particular loyalties except to an anonymous, shifting collective of people who all want the same thing as Young Fathers—to be one thing, then the next, then the next.</p></div>"|20391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20391-white-men-are-black-men-too/|6.8|Jia Tolentino

Maybe it was the time their band played with one of Thomas' 156 (give or take) musical projects at a warehouse in Ypsilanti. Or maybe they crossed paths at a demonstration in Detroit. To quote a colleague, ""Fred Thomas is<i> always</i> standing right behind you at a basement show in Ann Arbor."" Which is to say that Thomas is a ""lifer"", that mainstay of the local scene usually viewed with some combination of admiration and concern. Their commitment is cool even if they’re pushing 40 and clearly not in it for the money, but what are their alternatives? Do they have any marketable job skills?</p>
<p>Thomas' most well-known project, the lo-fi throwback pop troupe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3699-saturday-looks-good-to-me"" target=""_blank""><span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_465590022""><span class=""aQJ"">Saturday</span></span> Looks Good to Me</a>, developed a cult following, but was always on the verge of a mainstream-indie breakthrough that never happened. He's also released eight albums under his own name, but <i>All Are Saved</i> is the first to see widespread release. From the sound of things, <span class=""il"">Fred</span> <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> would be at peace if it was his last. It's in the tradition of a very specific kind of record, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30204-father-john-misty"" target=""_blank"">Father John Misty</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16597-fear-fun/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fear Fun</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Kil Moon</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16674-among-the-leaves"" target=""_blank""><i>Among the Leaves</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4626-the-wrens/"" target=""_blank"">the Wrens</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8742-the-meadowlands"" target=""_blank"">The Meadowlands</a></i>—artists reinventing themselves as <i>their actual self, </i>lifers tired of watching their life pass by, tired of public indifference. With nothing to lose, <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> ditches any pretense of metaphor to speak on every embarrassment and sleep-depriving doubt. And the results are devastating and funny in ways that previous releases barely even considered, a biographical work of art capable of leveling people who have never heard of <span class=""il"">Fred</span> <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> until the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a record of epiphany, but there are no easy resolutions and false triumph. Despite its title, <i>All Are Saved</i> does not wrestle with mortality and arise with The Truth About What it All Means. It does not glorify the preciousness of our short existence. Most of it is derived from the realization that life, as it’s keenly described on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17347-fred-thomas-cops-dont-care-pt-ii/"" target=""_blank"">""Cops Don’t Care Pt. II""</a>, ""is so incredibly long/ Like a kiss on a bridge between two nervous ass kids/ Terrified of doing everything wrong."" The image of teenage lip-locking pops up on two different songs: on ""When They Built the Schools"", <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> recognizes the ""jelly legs and awkward elbows"" of first-timers who have no time for the ""burden of nostalgia"" that clings to<span class=""il""> him</span> like a wetsuit and essentially translates to ""regret"".</p>
<p>Most of the memories Thomas processes on <i>All Are Saved</i> aren’t even <i>good</i> ones, and yet they’re revived with piercing clarity—drunkenly smashing his flip phone in a Baltimore basement in 2003; watching a girl get embarrassed by her dad’s use of slang on an airplane; the role reversal of going to a free dental clinic and having his dentist turn out to be a drummer he produced eight years ago. These are the types of situations that fill up an impossibly long life, so when <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> opens the album asking his dog in its dying days whether trading 13 years of ""walking in a clear straight line"" for a human’s eight potential decades of fumbling is a ""shitty deal"", well... the answer is obvious, right?</p>
<p>The album at least<i> sounds</i> uplifting, adding layer after layer while <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> spins desperately in place. The aesthetic reflects the two cities in which this album was created, honoring Athens' indie rock lineage by its Elephant 6-style thrift shop orchestration. If you’ve followed <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> over the past two decades, this is a culminating work: the contrast of peppy horn blasts and foul-mouthed misanthropy on ""Expo '87"" recall <span class=""aBn"" data-term=""goog_465590023""><span class=""aQJ"">Saturday</span></span> Looks Good to Me; the spindly arpeggios of ""When They Built the Schools"" nod towards his emo-ish offshoot Lovesick; and the aquatic gurgling and electronic interludes make a case for reappreciation of his Type Records outlier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13287-city-center"" target=""_blank"">City Center</a> (namechecked in ""Unfading Flower"").</p>
<p>But otherwise, this is an idiosyncratic ""singer-songwriter"" record, filled with surprises and unorthodox percussion choices—a soupy tabla sample on ""Unfading Flower"", an erratic pound of a floor tom guiding the drunken amble of ""When They Built the Schools"". Vocally, <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> largely abandons conventional song structure and melodies, taking on a quasi spoken-word approach that allows him the maximum word count and lends a sarcastic edge to his sly note on""Bedbugs"": ""If I seem too entertaining, I’m not singing, I’m just talking to you.""</p>
<p>The most entertaining songs on <i>All Are Saved</i> are generally the cruelest: Both ""Bedbugs"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17300-fred-thomas-bad-blood/"" target=""_blank"">""Bad Blood""</a> speak in a language simultaneously more truthful and cutting than most of us allow ourselves. These rambling, bilious one-sided conversations might be mislabeled as ""rants""; more accurately, they’re the kind of righteously angry emails you spend all night honing to a fine point, and then sleep on, waking up relieved you never hit ""Send."" <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> provides us vicarious catharsis, but during the toxic airing of grievances of ""Bedbugs"", he makes the risks of such an approach perfectly clear—""You can’t tell everybody to fuck off forever.../ And be mortified when they finally do.""</p>
<p><span class=""il"">Thomas</span> trudges through difficult relationships like most of us, being ""so stilted and silent, not awkward, just angry."" That’s how he describes his presumable run-in with a more successful artist on ""Bad Blood"", whose music he likens to ""a pile of brown sweaters."" All at once, he wishes he could go beyond their brief exchange and express his envy and resentments, that it could be <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> on TV in 2015 had things worked out just a little bit differently for Saturday Looks Good to Me. Instead, he blasts through the fourth wall, summarizing the futility of his past decade with a gut punch—""This ‘first day of school’ shit just seems to keep happening...the smiles are so big and there’s no one at the gig."" The most painful lines are <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> quoting other people—""Hey I gotta go, but I’ll see you at the show!"", ""Man, it’s so cool, we’re glad you’re doing your own thing."" It's the sound of Thomas realizing that most of his interactions are compromised by his own self-pity and dishonesty.</p>
<p>And yet, this realization is the strange source of hope in <i>All Are Saved</i>: <span class=""il"">Thomas</span> seems inspired, even moved, by the possibility that the sharp, overwhelming and temporary pain of being forthright with someone can be a breakthrough after years and years of silence and half-truths.  It ties back to that line about those kids on the bridge and how <span class=""il"">Thomas </span>sets an example throughout <i>All Are Saved—</i>life is incredibly long when you’re terrified of doing anything wrong, and in the process of connecting with another person, it’s best to just go for it as directly as possible.</p></div>"|20357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20357-all-are-saved/|8.0|Ian Cohen

Not because the </span><span>opulent</span><span> pop of the Beach Boys, or his rich and tortured personal mythology, are showing any fade in ubiquity—a </span><a href=""http://loveandmercyfilm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>movie about both</span></a><span>, with Paul Dano and John Cusack playing younger and current-day versions of him, respectively, comes out this summer—but because the man himself is </span><a href=""http://smashinginterviews.com/interviews/musicians/brian-wilson-interview-talks-60s-sound-of-no-pier-pressure-and-why-love-mercy-brought-back-a-lot-of-scary-memories"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>speaking bluntly</span></a><span> of his possible retirement from music this year.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So for anyone who grew up with a reverence for Wilson’s</span><span> brilliant work—</span><span>which, especially if you’re from California, can veer into a fanatic sort of transposed paternal empathy—his new and eleventh solo album </span><i>No Pier Pressure</i><span> carries the burden of serving as his gold watch. </span><span>Yet the record largely cedes the floor to duets with trendy young singers (Kacey Musgraves, Nate Ruess of fun., Zooey Deschanel, all audibly rhapsodic), a foreign and not entirely flattering experiment for Wilson. The album’s clearest predecessor is Santana’s </span><i>Supernatural</i><span> (1999), from which sprang the malevolent radio hydra </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Whgn_iE5uc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Smooth""</a>,</span><span> and other forays into May-September duet hinterland. (There’s been an upswing of the latter in the past year, from Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga </span><a href=""http://www.cheek2cheek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>fluttering their jazz hands</span></a><span> all hither and thither to Barry Manilow’s gauche, </span><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/My-Dream-Duets-Barry-Manilow/dp/B00MIA0MHQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>grave-digging extreme</span></a><span> of shoving his voice into dusty audio of Whitney Houston and Marilyn Monroe.)  </span></p>
<p>Unlike Carlos Santana, though, who could just wedge in a noodling guitar break and shuffle back to <a href=""http://www.carlosshoes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>his inexplicable stiletto empire</span></a>, Wilson’s chipper duets never reach equilibrium. Either his presence feels underutilized—the syrupy ""On the Island"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5676-she-him/"">She &amp; Him</a>, in which his vocals are scant—or the guests feel shoehorned into musty production that undermines their own charisma. It’s apparent throughout that this album was <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brian-wilsons-girl-powered-lp-in-the-studio-with-the-beach-boy-20140718"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>originally intended</span></a> as a reunited Beach Boys effort, as their songwriting staples are faithfully represented: the orchestrations are lush and swooning, the lyrics set in beatific seaside tableaus and brimming with sepia wistfulness. Wilson sounds most confident with his former band cohorts; several tracks feature amiable turns from Al Jardine and David Marks. Of the whippersnapper duets, Wilson’s coziest harmonizing with Ruess, whose high, earnest keening could’ve been plucked from the Beach Boys’ <i>Sunflower</i> era.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In listening to <i>No Pier Pressure</i>, uneasy questions rise about base motives. Wilson freely admits that he <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/brian-wilson-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>doesn’t listen to modern music</span></a>, and was so surprised to hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a> rap that he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58994-brian-wilson-says-he-cut-frank-ocean-from-his-album-because-frank-wanted-to-rap-not-sing/""><span>dismissed him from the album</span></a>. That likely means that these duet artists were pitched to him for the project, with the hopes that some of those younger fanbases would follow along. <span>It’s a pretty farfetched </span><span>expectation: are Zooey Deschanel’s fans now really going to stampede </span><span>en masse to the nearest Urban Outfitters and demand <i>Orange Crate Art</i>?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But to speculate this project was foisted whole on Wilson would infantilize him, a casual disservice done all too readily in the press (what other 72-year-old Grammy winner’s collaborations would prompt the caveat </span><a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Album-review-Brian-Wilson-No-Pier-Pressure-6177368.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""whether he’s aware of it or not,""</span></a><span> despite his ability to </span><a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6524001/brian-wilson-no-pier-pressure-album-love-and-mercy-biopic-exclusive-premiere"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>still deliver an incisive interview</span></a><span>?). And there’s a warm timbre to all these artists’ voices that could surely appeal to Wilson. Whatever the cause, this is new territory for him: He’s sat in with young bucks here and there (</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--a78z8kvww"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Mini Mansions</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLcyiCwMHw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Emile Haynie</span></a><span>, the adulatory </span><a href=""http://thebestfest.com/brian-fest/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Brian Fest</span></a><span> concert last month in Los Angeles) but he’s never been gregarious with his own material. His most recent album collaborators have been old friends returned to the fold, from a reunion </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12155-that-lucky-old-sun/""><span>with </span><span>Smile</span><span> lyricist Van Dyke Parks</span></a><span> to the global Beach Boys reunion of 2012.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s a happy accident in disunion, though: the closing track ""The Last Song"", which was originally intended for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a> before she <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/brian-wilson-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>sulked off into the sunset.</span></a> It’s the autonomous note Wilson deserves to end on, a lovely, bittersweet swath of the elegiac strings and gilded harmonies he perfected in his youth with ""The Warmth of the Sun"" and ""Caroline, No"". Wilson sighs, ""Don’t be sad/ There was a time and place for what we had/ If there was just another chance for me to sing to you."" It’s a worthy, prideful summation of a gorgeous life’s work, both innocent and wizened at once. And he didn’t need any young blood to get there.</p></div>"|20367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20367-brian-wilson-no-pier-pressure/|5.6|Stacey Anderson

The son of Canadian folk artist David Woodhead, he grew up surrounded by live music and studio equipment, and discovered production while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8972-doldrums/"">tweaking his father's tracks into a noisy mess</a>. As a teenager, he ambled around Europe and was invited to live at Toronto DIY space House of Everlasting Super Joy, which eventually brought him into the famed Montreal scene responsible for birthing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"">Purity Ring</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/"">Majical Cloudz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17980-blue-hawaii/"">Blue Hawaii</a>, <a href=""http://arbutusrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arbutus Records</a>, et al. Hell, Woodhead's first song released as Doldrums was an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKMuY28xGPU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">official remix</a> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a>, an obvious and important inspiration to the '90s baby's synthy, sample-based avant-pop. It all reads like a young, independent artist's fantasy, and a more advantageous backdrop for Doldrums' first LP couldn't be dreamed up.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17646-doldrums-lesser-evil/""><i>Lesser Evil</i></a> made good on that promise in 2013, revealing that Woodhead's frenzied melodic sensibilities and nasally squeak could transcend the cresting wave of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/""><i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i></a> devotees. <i>Lesser Evil</i> was also fortunate enough to be wedged between the ascending stars of Grimes' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16211-grimes-visions/""><i>Visions</i></a> and Majical Cloudz's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18042-majical-cloudz-impersonator/""><i>Impersonator</i></a>: It was a good time to be an arty millennial with a laptop, and better still to be an information-hungry sound collagist with a distinctive voice. But where <i>Visions</i> embraced fluttering digitalia and <i>Impersonator</i> took a more direct, humanist approach, Doldrums' first LP burrowed into the uncanny valley, forging its identity from the schizophrenic clutter of online media and the hallucinatory states readily available in everyday life. Sleep, lucid dreaming, technology, ancient mysticism, prescription drugs, obscure YouTube clips, popular music, obsession, anxiety, love, death—<i>Lesser Evil</i> somehow made it all fit inside a puzzling logic that was more intriguing for its inscrutable delirium.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So it makes sense that Woodhead would continue his train of thought on album two, </span><i>The Air Conditioned Nightmare</i><span>. But if </span><i>Lesser Evil</i><span> took a macro view of that mania through a greased fisheye lens, then </span><i>Nightmare</i><span> examines it with a magnifying glass under harsh fluorescent light. And that can be just as unflattering as it sounds. The elements and production methods haven't been replaced so much as they've been reassessed and recalibrated. No longer is Woodhead's Yorke-ian tenor awash in whirlpools of clipped audio and choppy beat fragments; now the underlying synths have taken a forceful lead next to polished and pronounced drum machines. Doldrums has effectively cleaned up his act, and in the process he's rendered his music's least remarkable parts the loudest and most integral.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A bonkers track like ""HOTFOOT"", or the elegiac splendor of ""Funeral for Lightning"", works best in this new setting, largely because the energy and songwriting are powerful enough to wheedle some emotional magic out of the machines. More often than not, though, </span><i>Nightmare</i><span> buries the details in favor of a generic synth hook or noodly freakout. The saccharine bassline in ""Loops"", itself a trite tale of feuding lovers, seems to be gunning for a 2008 Urban Outfitters compilation—that is, when the song doesn't digress into a beatless murk of pitchy vocals and awkward sample juggling. On ""Industry City"", Doldrums </span><span>attempts to balance aggressive electro, slippery machine funk, aerial singalongs, and noisy rave approximations. It might go over well at a midday festival performance, but on record it sounds like tracklist filler.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are good ideas somewhere inside </span><i>The Air Conditioned Nightmare</i><span>, and anyone determined enough to look might get something out of them. Lyrics ranging from naively clichéd to slyly astute—often within the same verse—sketch a rough picture of Woodhead coming to grips with routine, non-transitory life. He fears the impending threat of mundane domestic relationships (""Blown Away""), condemns technological dependence (""My Friend Simjen"", ""Industry City""), illustrates the throes of romance (""We Awake"", ""Loops""), and ponders the loss of art and artists (""Funeral for Lightning""). The themes here are vaguely linked to a collection of Henry Miller essays on America's growing disconnection from nature and mankind, but no one would fault you for not catching any similarities outside of their shared title. Not even the singer himself can find a clear through line for his scattered coming-of-age musings. Some might call it simply ""growing up.""</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-2c355252-8adb-986b-e12c-e478683982f1"">Of all the songs, ""Video Hostage"" is the most significant. It also happens to be <i>Nightmare</i>'s unrivaled highlight. Over a rhythmic sample set that billows and sways like something off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/""><i>Replica</i></a>, Woodhead waxes analytical while in a trauma-induced existential trance. He's <a href=""http://diymag.com/2015/04/01/doldrums-gives-a-guide-to-new-album-the-air-conditioned-nightmare"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>said</span></a> it's loosely about desensitization, but the song also touches on questions of personal background, identity, artistic motivation, and nature. Woodhead seems to shed the world around him, examining finer aspects of his inner self. He's looking for the devil in the details, so to speak, and the music's effortless, unassuming composition mirrors his effort. You could say it's a rare sign of growth on the capricious <i>Nightmare</i>, but maybe it's just Doldrums finding himself right where he needs to be.</span></p></div>"|20363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20363-the-air-conditioned-nightmare/|5.4|Patric Fallon

Their follow-up, 2011’s <i>This Modern Glitch,</i> followed suit. But in the four years between their second and third albums, the sweet silliness has dissipated. With <i>Glitterbug</i>, the Wombats have repositioned themselves as more pained, serious characters, longing to get away from the life of excessive parties and settle into a meaningful relationship. At their worst, they degenerate into sleaze, delivering lines like ""There‘s no greater sight than you in your underwear removing mine.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Many of the synth-tinged songs on <i>Glitterbug </i>would sound right at home on a John Hughes soundtrack, and the album itself plays like a rom-com concept album, chronicling singer and guitarist Matthew Murphy’s long-distance romantic relationship with a girl he began dating in L.A. while he was still based in London (""My head is aching in GMT,"" he sings in a polite Robert Smith-style pout on ""Give Me a Try""). It’s ironic that a band whose singer once sang ""if this is a rom-com, kill the director"" would be putting forth something like this. But there’s more drama here than in previous works: <span id=""docs-internal-guid-711141da-99c0-b952-d030-955b2548604a"">Maybe Murphy is killing the director himself. </span>The number of drug references within the lyrics would seem like teenage exaggeration were it not for Murphy’s matter-of-fact delivery. There’s no ""The Wombats Proudly Present"" as a subtitle to <i>Glitterbug</i>, as there was for the first two releases. Perhaps because the Wombats as you knew them aren’t present, and they don’t always seem proud.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Glitterbug</i> mostly seems like it was born of a frustration of not having made it in the States yet. The defining moment of the album comes when all the instruments drop out of ""Give Me a Try"" and Murphy proclaims, ""We could be gigantic!"" If you asked him, he'd probably say it was the girl in L.A., but he seems to also be not-so-covertly courting potential American fans. You can hear the same beseeching subtext in the single, ""Your Body Is a Weapon"", where Murphy sings ""Is it such fantasy that I should think someone like you could love a creep like me?""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And the Wombats are seemingly pulling out all the stops to be gigantic. Instead of using a number of producers, as they did with their previous two releases, the Wombats recorded most of the tracks at the studio of Mark Crew, who can be credited with fast-tracking Bastille into U.S. arenas. And as with Bastille and other short-haired Euro rockers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2370-keane/"">Keane</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3853-snow-patrol/"">Snow Patrol</a>, there’s a very palatable poppy sheen on all of these tracks: <i>Glitterbug</i> is packed with anthemic hooks and synth pulses that sound like they were composed solely to lure Lexus. But what sets the Wombats apart from those acts is the lechery and squalor just beneath the surface. And when a car company inevitably co-opts one of the songs for a commercial, those in the know can quietly laugh at the wild disconnect with the subject matter.</p></div>"|20345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20345-glitterbug/|5.7|Pat Healy

She's just 26, but with more than a dozen releases to her name courtesy of projects like P.S. Eliot, collaborations like Great Thunder, and assorted guest spots here and there, she comes off like the leader of a DIY folk-inflected indie rock/punk scene, a spokesperson for a realm usually against spokespeople.</p>
<p>Crutchfield grew up in Alabama, naming her project after Waxahatchee Creek, where her parents have a house on a lake and where she's made a lot of her music. She's in Philadelphia now, an East Coast city that's cheaper than New York and that allows for more time to make music and just live. It follows, then, that there's a thriving scene there, too, with groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31468-radiator-hospital/"">Radiator Hospital</a> (featuring one-time Waxahatchee member <span class=""st"">Sam Cook-Parrott)</span> and members of her twin sister (and ex-P.S. Eliot bandmate) Allison's band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30624-swearin/"">Swearin'</a>, among others.</p>
<p><i>Ivy Tripp</i>, her third album as Waxahatchee, finds her fronting a band featuring multi-instrumentalists Kyle Gilbride and Keith Spencer (both from Swearin') and still coming off very much like she did on 2012's lo-fi solo effort, <i>American Weekend</i>. She's managed to bring in contributors and a greater range of instrumentation without losing that approachable intimacy. 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17688-waxahatchee-cerulean-salt/""><i>Cerulean Salt</i></a> technically had more people playing on it, but <i>Ivy Tripp</i> just <i>feels</i> bigger, in part because Crutchfield is growing steadily more confident. The songs are more cohesive and accomplished—polished isn't the right word, but now and then, there is a kind of shine. <i>Cerulean</i> came off like an extension of <i>American Weekend</i>: it surfaced just as many people were discovering the earlier record, and some listeners were confused by the timeline and which came first. <i>Ivy Tripp</i>, her first album for <a href=""https://www.mergerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merge</a>, feels more like a next step, something that exists on its own, and a move toward something else entirely.</p>
<p>In a statement about the album, Crutchfield said the title of the record is ""just a term I made up for directionless-ness, specifically of the 20-something, 30-something, 40-something of today, lacking regard for the complacent life path of our parents and grandparents."" She added: ""I have thought of it like this: <i>Cerulean Salt</i> is a solid and <i>Ivy Tripp</i> is a gas."" This make sense.<i> Cerulean</i> was an album about growing up and losing your innocence and <i>Ivy</i> seems to be about knowing yourself as a grown up, being in the middle of that, and figuring out what comes next. The past is definable and relatively solid; the future is more amorphous and trickier to capture or pin down. You get that sense, of searching, of grasping at something you don't entirely understand, in the album's lyrics and overall narrative.</p>
<p>The exact ""Ivy Tripp"" line on the record is ""Travel the world ivy tripping/ With no spotlight,"" and it's interesting to see where she's at now, as the spotlight finds its focus. On ""Grey Hair"" she sings: ""You might, wait and see me become/ A candle, precarious psychically among/ The ill at ease, the summer breeze/ But sugar soda pop songs play on the radio."" And, as she noted about the record, ""I think a running theme [of <i>Ivy Tripp</i>] is steadying yourself on shaky ground and reminding yourself that you have control in situations that seem overwhelming."" She doesn't deny the ambition either: ""I get short of breath because I can’t slow down,"" she sings (""Grey Hair"").</p>
<p>Many of <i>Ivy Tripp</i>'s song titles—""The Dirt"", ""Half Moon"", ""Bonfire""—are dusky and colored like earth tones, and that's the setting of the songs as well: moments in transition, the realm between night and day and relationships that have that same kind of momentary feeling. The lyrics feature many maybes and more than a few temporary situations (""You can lean on me for now"" in ""La Loose""), unread books, and things that may or may not have already ended. ""I’ll try to preserve the routine/ And I don’t want to discuss what it means,"" Crutchfield sings on ""La Loose"". People ""pretend to be strangers/ Lamenting a means to an end"" (""Air"") and ""imitate some kind of love"" (""Stale By Noon"") instead of just being in love. Music's an ""imperfect escape"" (""Half Moon"").</p>
<p>A low-level anxiety pervades, and on a song simply titled ""&lt;"" she offers an update on the Blank Generation: ""You’re less than me and I am nothing,"" goes the chorus. Earlier, in ""The Dirt"", she sings ""I’m a basement brimming with nothing great<span>.""</span> In ""Summer of Love"", a photo of people, and not the actual people, are the subject: ""The colors allure me but I can’t make out/ A face in the picture of palm trees/ The summer of love is a photo of us."" ""Sugar"" comes up a lot—a sweet thing without a lot of substance, but that tastes good. There's a penchant for finding beauty in small gestures and situations like sleeping or refusing to leave the beach. As well as bigger ones: ""You’ll deliver a fable I could live/ And I’ll throw it off the nearest cliff,"" she sings in ""The Dirt"".</p>
<p>The one thing that can drag <i>Ivy Tripp</i> down a little is that the lyrics are at times a bit vague or interchangeable. It turns out discussing emptiness can maybe feel a bit empty, and the words here don't always hit as hard as some of her prior work. That said, the way the words are delivered is essential, and with a voice like Crutchfield's—both rough and clear with a slight Southern twang—a lot gets said simply in how these things are enunciated.</p>
<p>That, and the album features a few of Crutchfield's best and catchiest songs. She's mentioned an interest in the New Zealand lo-fi pop band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4392-tall-dwarfs/"">Tall Dwarfs</a>; <i>Ivy Tripp</i> has the feel of classic indie rock. You'll be reminded of other groups here and there: ""The Dirt"" sounds a lot like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10106-the-vaselines/"">the Vaselines</a>, at least compositionally, and much of it would fit in very well at the original International Pop Underground Convention, on <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/35349-Simple-Machines-Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Simple Machines</a>, or with '90s Merge acts like Butterglory or Bricks (the fact that she did sign to Merge makes perfect sense—Crutchfield and her cohorts carry the same torch as <span class=""st""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6231-mac-mccaughan/""> Mac McCaughan</a> and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/322617-Laura-Ballance"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laura Ballance</a>).</span> She's mentioned Joni Mitchell <a href=""https://twitter.com/k_crutchfield/status/562744516244168706"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">time again</a>, as well as Cat Stevens, though on <i>Ivy</i>, you may think more about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"">Cat Power</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQzwyKCZGP0&amp;list=PLLniiH1IBXKelx7xVtCKYRir8tWwQPmyW"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>What Would the Community Think</i></a>.</p>
<p>Maybe as a result of the cross-pollination and familiarity, there's a casual feel to <i>Ivy Tripp</i>, something about it that's unhurried and relaxed. Which doesn't mean it isn't ambitious or accomplished. This is one way it's most reminiscent of the best '90s indie rock: it never feels forced or like she's making some kind of push. It's unhurried and natural and real. You also get a feeling listening to these songs that Crutchfield is just getting started, and it's exciting to hear a young voice rising so assuredly above the fray, one you can imagine inspiring kids years from now, and inspiring them to pick up guitars and sing and take control of their direction, too.</p></div>"|20437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20437-ivy-tripp/|8.1|Brandon Stosuy

Stumbling on my first video from Sicko Mobb, the duo of North Lawndale natives Lil Trav and Lil Ceno, at the bottom of a deep YouTube rabbit hole that summer, I was enthralled. ""Fiesta"", Sicko Mobb’s first song ever, had a finger-plucked beat that mimicked the rickety jostle of a go-kart track in need of repairs, brought to life by the duo’s barreling sing-raps. The individual components of Sicko’s sound were familiar, cherry-picked from Atlanta trap, Chicago footwork, and drill—even radio bubblegum—but the composite was unlike anything else out. The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qVGipVdut0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> looked like most every other Chicago rap video of its moment, except that everyone in it was smiling.</p>
<p>Sicko Mobb’s debut mixtape, <i>Super Saiyan Vol. 1</i>, was released in the last days of 2013, following the announcement that they’d signed a publishing deal with Stellar Songs/Water Music Publishing, Norwegian pop production duo Stargate's imprint for Sony. It was clear they were evolving quickly. Their skeletal, unmastered early tracks began to give way to glossy, more-is-more confections, with well-placed features from local heroes like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4345-twista/"">Twista</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"">Lil Durk</a>. The duo’s latent pop instincts were developing in real time, but they’d been in existence for less than a year, and still had some kinks to work out. The tape’s production quality was so sketchy that a remastered version was released months later—also swapping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30648-aap-ferg/"">A$AP Ferg</a>’s ""Fiesta"" remix for the original, a hint at Sicko’s then-undisclosed deal with Polo Grounds, home of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30605-aap-mob/"">A$AP Mob</a>. You had to wonder if Trav and Ceno had enough ideas to sustain a career past the initial endorphin rush.</p>
<p>Sicko’s sophomore project, <a href=""http://www.audiomack.com/album/fakeshoredrive/super-saiyan-vol-2-no-dj"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Super Saiyan Vol. 2</i></a>, proves the two have more tricks up their sleeves, and have clearly put the year-plus between releases to good use. Not only have Trav and Ceno sustained the momentum for a subgenre many wrote off as a passing phase, but they’ve also cleared out a previously nonexistent bop middle ground. <i>SSV2</i> is the most approachable manifestation of the bop sound yet, thanks to the duo’s increasing aptitude for crisp songwriting. The tape’s initially intimidating 23 tracks (not to worry: many are brief skits, and unexpectedly hilarious ones at that) are loaded with euphoric hooks and melodic twists and turns, embellished lavishly with crystalline synths and soaring skrrrtpeggios. Sicko have slowed down the tempo without sacrificing too much of the energy, giving Trav and Ceno’s heavily stylized flows room to breathe. They’ve tightened up the lyrics, too—for starters, they’re actually legible this time around. But where <i>SSV1</i>’s lyrics functioned as a mood board of lituations meant for quick scanning, on <i>SSV2</i>, their bars are worth a closer read.</p>
<p>""Kool Aid"", the tape’s lead single, doubles as the best example of Sicko 2.0. It’s the duo’s most leisurely song to date, significantly slower-paced than their usual fare but as sticky-sweet as its namesake beverage. Nobody is looking to Sicko Mobb lyrics for debate team fodder, but over the twinkling beat by the Blue Ranger, Trav and Ceno have honed in on a lyrical mode that perfectly suits them. Sicko’s music is often described in synesthetic terms—drippy candy-paint hues and high-fructose teeth-buzz—which they’ve cleverly repurposed here. ""Black coupes, bitch, we got the juice/ Orange Porsches, flavor orange juice/ Apple Benz, Bentley color blue/ Purple in my cup and rose, too,"" Trav coos like it’s the world’s most PG-13 nursery rhyme, with sensory details so vivid they’d make <a href=""http://sneakertalk.yuku.com/topic/231646#.VSNZr9zqZBU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Young Dro</a> jealous. Along with a generous handful of tracks including ""Penny HardAway"", ""Own Lane"", and the anthemic ""Rolling Stone"", it’s not out of the question to picture it crossing over with the right push.</p>
<p><i>SSV1</i> dropped in late December, the worst time of year for new music, especially given the duo’s summer-hued block party sounds. They’ve strategized this time, releasing <i>SSV2</i> just in time for the warm weather it channels. The timing feels right considering the rap landscape more broadly, too. When Sicko first emerged, mainstream rap was transitioning between moody phases, gradually edging out of Mike WiLL’s brooding reign. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> was spiraling away from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/""><i>Pluto</i></a>’s romanticism towards hoarse, punishing trap like ""Sh!t"", and drill remained relevant even as the spotlight shifted away; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> were rolling out their most sullen albums yet. Sicko’s relentlessly cheery aesthetic wasn’t particularly cool, or marketable. But <i>SSV2</i> arrives in the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32655-rae-sremmurd/"">Rae Sremmurd</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20113-sremmlife/"">debut</a>, an album stuffed with hits that have brought unabashed exuberance back to the rap charts, along with poignant, earnest 2014 smashes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen"">iLoveMakonnen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32661-rich-gang/"">Rich Gang</a>. Even Kanye’s seemed to lighten up in recent months. Joy is cool again, and nobody does joy quite like Sicko Mobb.</p></div>"|20470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20470-super-saiyan-vol-2/|7.9|Meaghan Garvey

Bassist and vocalist Mlny Parsonz left her home in New Jersey for the Peach State, where she linked up with guitarist/songwriter Josh Weaver, whom she eventually married (they have since split as a couple, but not as bandmates). Weaver belonged to a non-traditional church that appealed to some local artists and musicians, and when they introduced Parsonz, then an addict, to their religion, she saw a chance at redemption. ""I ended up quitting a lot—I was like, man, I'm gonna stop doing drugs and all this stuff as a way to clean up my life,"" she recalled in a recent <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/03/16/90-mlny-parsonz-of-royal-thunder/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MetalSucks podcast</a>, ""So in my early twenties, I had started going to this church, got kind of locked into it."" Parsonz and the other women in the church attended conferences where they were brainwashed to recall ""visions"" of their youth in detail for three days. Unsurprisingly, she lost her mind. With a reluctant Weaver by her side, the singer told the pastor she’d be back in two Sundays, got in the car, and never returned.</p>
<p>The days of the cult are over, but the guilt and the lingering doubts remain to haunt Royal Thunder's cavernous jams like ghosts in a manor. By the same token, the band's repulsion towards the structures (religious, cultural, or otherwise) that controlled them in the past reinforces a fierce impetus to innovate and impress, making them not entirely dissimilar from similarly strident acts around the state, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2699-mastodon/"">Mastodon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10043-kylesa/"">Kylesa</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"">Baroness</a>. It may have sported some uneven mixing and a few too many loose ends, but Royal Thunder's promising 2012 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16781-cvi/""><i>CVI </i></a>offered an emotional, self-assured, and diverse take on heavy psych viewed through a swampy lens. On their sophomore effort <i>Crooked Doors</i>, the quartet expand upon the anthemic aims of their debut, bolstered by a new guitarist and a proggier palette.</p>
<p>Contrasted with the traditional hard rock arrangements of <i>CVI</i>, <i>Crooked Doors </i>offers an expansive array of styles and textures across its 11 tracks, from understated folk to surging blues to labyrynthine instrumentals. Given the generous runtime of the tracks (most run over five minutes), it’s not uncommon for several of these elements to surface within a single song. Opener ""Time Machine"" rises up with a sturdy, tambourine-driven groove reminiscent of Heart, but before long Weaver’s short, choppy passages elongate, creating a bridge that appears to operate in zero gravity before the entire thing comes crashing back down to Earth for the finale. They employ a similarly bifold strategy on the heavier ""Glow"", making bedfellows of slide guitars and grungy choruses before gauzy strumming ushers in a period of calm. The aforementioned tracks are long-winded, but they’re grounded in robust choruses, which in turn derive their strength from Parsonz’s impassioned vocals. Show-offy and sinister, her multi-tracked soprano recalls Janis Joplin by way of Joan Jett, and the melodic cadences she employs on ""Glow"" and the Middle Eastern-tinged ""Forgive Me, Karma"" run the gamut from hymnal to hellbent.  </p>
<p>As the tempos stagnate towards the album’s back end, though, the affective force of her vocals loses potency—particularly on the pedestrian ballad ""One Day""—and all the runs in the world can't distract from the sameness. Admittedly, it feels strange to apply that sort of pejorative to an album that juggles opium-den mysticism (""Forgive Me, Karma""), dissociative psych (""Wake Up""), and reflections on brainwashing (""Floor""), but the main paradigms of <i>CVI </i>remain largely unchanged: On the aforementioned songs and more, drummer Evan Diprima and Parsonz start things off low and slow, tethering a cathartic buildup to a hook that subsequently pops its head out from prettier psychedelic scenery. It gets formulaic, to say the least. An intriguing, though ultimately unsuccessful exception arrives with closing two-fer ""The Bear I"" and ""The Bear II"", an exercise in stylistic restraint that frames Parsonz’s heart-wrought singing in pianos and violins, rather than guitars. While this feels like the perfect launching-off point for a solo venture, it's an underwhelming closing statement, too vague to do the band’s personnel and their creation story justice.</p></div>"|20354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20354-crooked-doors/|5.9|Zoe Camp

Her words are plainspoken and upfront, a PSA amidst otherwise-abstract swatches of explosive guitar noise, psychedelic circling drums, and muffled vocals. Pooknyw has said she spent 180 hours mixing Broken Water’s third full-length, <i>Wrought</i>, with Steve Fisk (the late-'80s producer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"">Beat Happening</a>). Which is to say, the moments when you can and cannot hear her statements are presumably very intentional.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This attention to detail is a progression for the Olympia trio, who formed in 2008, specializing in a weary yet cathartic sort of dream punk. The sound mixes ebbing shoegaze guitars and fast pings of aggression, with vocals split between Pooknyw’s indie-pop lilt and guitarist Jon Hanna’s scraping, unapologetically grunge twang. Broken Water are a politics-upfront kind of band, the kind whose drummer would take her clothes off at a hardcore festival to <a href=""http://www.wonderingsound.com//interview/who-is/who-are-broken-water/?show_review=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>deconstruct</span></a> ideas about materialism, punk, and image; scream ""MALE FREEDOM"" at men taking up too much space at shows; who had a song on their first demo called <a href=""http://brokenwatermusic.bandcamp.com/track/feminism"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Feminism""</a> which plainly (and literally) spelled out the word in the lyrics. At the same time, they’ve also routinely drawn inspiration from improvisational psych-punk and drone jams. Before <i>Wrought</i>, Broken Water’s last release was a wordless EP of two 15-minute songs, <a href=""http://brokenwatermusic.bandcamp.com/album/seaside-sedmikrasky-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Seaside &amp; Sedmikrasky</i></a>, with string arrangements by Lori Goldston of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It is appropriate, then, that Broken Water’s string of three LPs and two EPs have slipped between explicitly radical and introspective. And that </span><i>Wrought</i><span> opens with questions rather than answers. ""Am I right or am I wrong? All I know is I do not know,"" goes the beginning of ""High-Lo"". It’s a simple but poignant sentiment, tapping into the tension that comes from a life spent deliberating values and questioning everything. ""</span><span>Scapegoats for the police state over petty theft/ Yet we trust the dollar bill and uniforms with guns?"" she asks on ""Love and Poverty"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Wrought</i> searches for beauty in monotony and interrogates everyday oppressions, often in the same track. ""1984"" is a sprawling meditation on surveillance culture, where Pooknyw sings atop layers of slow-moving guitars about the NSA’s collect-it-all program of location-based metadata and turns it into something more poetic. ""Are you aware you are observed?"" she sings, her voice cool and even, almost drab. Other punk bands might pry open these ideas with palpable urgency, but Broken Water capture a central sadness and a numbness, tapping into the surreality of the surveillance state.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Close"" is Pooknyw’s take on a soul-crushing service industry job, with images of broken glass, mopping the floor, counting the till, locking the door. At the end of the night she tells herself over tired-sounding, behind-the-beat drums: ""More… need something more… than my wages garnished for a war."" On the page, Pooknyw’s punk poetry outlines a relatable, simple-enough narrative, but its wise and weathered feeling is made palpable in her deadpan vocal inflection and screeching walls of guitar noise. </span><span>Broken Water’s strength is in this multi-layered approach; they seem to understand intuitively how to underline and deepen their words with their playing, giving <i>Wrought</i> an almost-cinematic feel</span><span>. It seems fitting that Pooknyw is also a </span><a href=""https://vimeo.com/user1267458"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>filmmaker</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album finishes with ""Beach"", one of their lengthy stretches of meandering guitars, wordless vocals, and looming cello from Lori Goldston. This one clocks in at 12 minutes; it’s a testament to the fact that for all the broad strokes of politics, Broken Water are ultimately concerned with what they can evoke on an emotional level. By the time you flip the record over and start again, the same words that opened the record suddenly sound more charged, heavier, heartbreaking. ""Life … oh life.""</span></p></div>"|20416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20416-wrought/|7.5|Liz Pelly

Imagine if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"">Andy Stott</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20021-andy-stott-faith-in-strangers/""><i>Faith in Strangers</i></a> drew upon only Alison Skidmore’s voice and you have an idea of what Dozzy and Caragnano are up to here. There’s not a throb, kick or ambient wash to be heard, no hardware to spot. Caragnano’s effervescent and honed voice is the only instrument at work, providing stratospheric highs and low end, with Dozzy deploying an array of strategies and processing to mirror, multiply, and fracture Caragnano’s flexible voice across these nine tracks.</p>
<p>""Introduzione"" begins with Caragnano surrounded by multitudes of herself, a solo performer on a subway car soon crammed with chattering commuters jostling for space. While it sets the stage for what will follow, it’s one of <i>Sintetizzatrice</i>’s least interesting moments. But once Caragnano’s utterance ""rain"" on ""Starcloud"" begins to sound through the space, soon surrounded with innumerable echoes of herself, we enter two-and-a-half minutes of rarefied space, Caragnano’s every hum and sigh transmogrified into a heavenly body.</p>
<p>Dozzy finds myriad ways to recast Caragnano. ""Luci"" brings to mind the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick"">Julianna Barwick</a>. Dozzy takes the gossamer thread of a single breath at the start of ""Fraledune"", loops it until it becomes as expansive as a choir and then once that mass of sound is built, teases an even high sonority out of it. He moves Caragnano to the other end of the register for ""Parallelo"", favoring deep resonant tones, as if she is sounding from the bottom of a well. Another small mouth sound is used to approximate a thump on ""Parola"", which leads into the traditional Italian folk of ""Festa (A Mottola)"".</p>
<p>Myself, I prefer Caragnano when she’s less tangible and earthly, more cloudy and ineffable, as she is uttering ""love without sound."" About the only complaint to level at <i>Sintetizzatrice</i> is its brevity. The body-erasing moments collected here don't even break the half-hour mark, which is a shame, because the sound of Caragnano’s brief sighs stretched towards infinity is a wonderful sound in which to luxuriate. </p></div>"|20387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20387-sintetizzatrice/|7.2|Andy Beta

The guitar-driven giddiness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58125-toro-y-moi-announces-new-album-what-for-shares-empty-nesters/"">""Empty Nesters""</a> was a surprise whether or not you’ve heard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16520-toro-y-moi-june-2009/""><i>June 2009</i></a>, a collection of early Toro Y Moi recordings given a quiet, proper release in 2012. But at the very least, it provides precedent: before ""Blessa"", Bundick was sorting out what he wanted Toro Y Moi to be, and he wrote a number of classicist, lo-fi indie rock songs. Some of them kinda sounded like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_clMLVlNuI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No, really</a>.) That said, the past five years have seen Toro Y Moi change from a bedroom project to a tight, adventurous and successful touring band, so if <i>What For?</i> is Bundick revisiting his awkward phase, he’s doing so like a late bloomer confidently showing up to his high school reunion knowing just how well he’s aged.</p>
<p>Every Toro Y Moi release finds the band in transition, and so <i>What For?</i> might be seen as a regression in some ways; ditching guitar rock for electronics has become a sign of maturity for both listeners and artists, inverting the typical rockist trajectory. However, Bundick has always been canny about switching lanes: at the time, 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17516-anything-in-return/"">Anything in Return</a></i> felt like Toro Y Moi hitting its stride, making liquid and limber electro-acoustic dance-pop. Or, he sounded like a cuddly, plush <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou"">Caribou</a>, a role easier to accept in the absence of new Caribou music and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47276-toro-y-moi-to-release-new-dance-single-as-les-sins-on-caribous-jiaolong-label/"">mutual artistic appreciation between Bundick and Dan Snaith</a>. But then, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19762-caribou-our-love/""><i>Our Love</i></a> threatened to make Toro Y Moi redundant and while Bundick’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29197-les-sins/"">Les Sins</a> has run concurrent to his main gig, it's proven him to be an enthusiastic, earnest, and ultimately functional dance producer.</p>
<p><i>What For?</i> then serves as further evidence that Toro Y Moi’s malleability is the project's most endearing quality. That and Bundick is something of a post-grad role model, having the ability to be flexible, amenable to change, and ultimately successful in all ventures without showing much struggle. There are a handful of new modes here: the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"">Woods</a>-y rusticity on ""Ratcliff"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58974-toro-y-moi-shares-new-track-run-baby-run/"">""Run Baby Run""</a>’s pinwheel-eyed pop-rock would’ve been out of place on any prior release. But throughout, there’s revelation in the aesthetic familiarity Bundick has established: in particular, the globular harmonies, cushy production, and a pervasive dampness that either recalls the fog of his new home Berkeley or the humidity of his native South Carolina.</p>
<p>So if this is called Toro Y Moi’s ""indie rock album,"" the ""rock"" part is a vestigial appendage: yes, the basis for pretty much everything here is a trad power trio set up and the synthesizers use tones that predate the '80s and will thus be called ""organic."" But this is guitar music without abrasion or yearning, and it’ll play just as well in the venues in which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15129-underneath-the-pine/""><i>Underneath the Pine</i></a> and <i>An</i><i>ything in Return</i> were suited for<span>—r</span>ooftop parties, barbecues, apartment get-togethers.  </p>
<p>And after his first three LPs were given counterintuitive deep winter release dates<span>, </span><i>What For?</i> admits to Toro Y Moi’s music sounding best when the weather’s making you feel a bit more irresponsible than usual. So, even when the band shows vigor during the liftoff of ""Empty Nesters"", the quick pivots of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58701-toro-y-moi-shares-buffalo/"">""Buffalo""</a>, and the uptempo funk of ""Spell It Out"", nothing seems particularly pressing. Even as Bundick appears to have moved on from post-collegiate concerns to straight-up adult problems, <i>What For?</i> most oftens advocates tabling discussion until emotions have settled.</p>
<p>Which is to say that the pleasantry of Toro Y Moi might not be its most endearing quality, but it’s certainly the most enduring. The conversation should not end there<span>—</span>they’re pleasant, but so is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a>. So is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a>. So is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs"">the War on Drugs</a>. So is the vast majority of popular indie rock. And though these are Toro Y Moi’s peers, putting Bundick against them might seem unfair: he does not deal with Big Emotional Issues as directly as the aforementioned. The bigger problem is that <i>What For?</i> doesn’t address much of anything directly, and that’s an issue on a record which appears to make Bundick’s chops as a songwriter and a lyricist a focal point.</p>
<p>Befitting a guy best known for crafting a vibe, one can <i>sense</i> these songs are emotive and heartfelt. But close reading for confirmation shows thoughts that may have once conveyed relatable feelings forced against their will to become lyrics, i.e., ""Let’s awaken and turn on our minds/ No one is waiting for you in this line."" Either that or the persistent indifference tipped by the title of <i>What For?</i> becomes maddening whenever Bundick soft-sells waffles like, ""It’s whatever you want to do"" or, subsequently, ""What is it you want to do?"" So when he pleads, ""do I need to spell it out,"" the answer is actually, ""well, <i>yes</i>."" Without any kind of emotional or sonic grain to grip, what were well-constructed, well-meaning songs minutes prior are reduced to placeholders in your memory<span>—""</span>the one with the clavinet,"" ""the lead single,"" ""the six-minute closer."" The problem isn't that Bundick avoids confrontation or confession<span>—</span>most people do. But <i>What For?</i> is so passive it leaves your system the moment you’re done with it.</p></div>"|20385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20385-what-for/|6.6|Ian Cohen

What if it all began with breath? That’s one question at the heart of Gabrielle Herbst’s debut album as GABI, in which the singer and composer takes gorgeous, gossamer songs—songs that <i>feel</i> all but a cappella, even when they rest upon a spongy cushion of chamber instruments—<span>and blows them out until they pull apart.</span> <i>Sympathy</i> is a vision of music as free-flowing as air.</p>
<p>Pop records written with this kind of academic rigor are rare. Herbst studied composition at Bard with new-music heavyweights like Zeena Parkins and Marina Rosenfeld; later, she was an artist-in-residence at Robert Wilson’s Watermill Center, and she has written a short opera. At the same time, she’s <a href=""http://exploringthemetropolis.org/2012/10/an-amalgamation-of-sounds-mixed-with-personal-fantasy-an-interview-with-gabrielle-herbst/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">identified</a> as someone who ""loves listening to loud, simple, unabashed, healing pop music.""</p>
<p><i>Sympathy</i> gets its meadowy textures from violin and viola, undistorted electric guitar, steadying piano, and vibraphone; loosely woven background vocals evoke both the pointillist harmonies of '60s girl groups and the contrapuntal clockworks of Meredith Monk. But it’s not always so dulcet. Major- and minor-key passages pivot into dissonant drones and unstable frequencies. The album resembles the quieter moments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16352-ekstasis/"">Ekstasis</a> </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18378-julia-holter-loud-city-song/""><i>Loud City Song</i></a>, and it also brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"">Julianna Barwick</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18408-julianna-barwick-nepenthe/""><i>Nepenthe</i></a>. But Herbst’s adventurous arrangements and occasionally white-knuckled sonics set it apart from Barwick’s more genial sound, and Herbst is less influenced by the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TrX9_qaN9M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pop standards</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7paoM2cghjI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">densely imagistic narratives</a> that drive Holter’s music.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Herbst’s voice is the main attraction. It is the first sound you hear, in fact, a clear soprano wreathed in natural reverb: ""I wait for you."" Embodied with the language of romantic yearning, her voice provides the through-line that holds the record together, whether foregrounded in soaring cadenzas or multi-tracked into dazzling, kaleidoscopic arrays.</p>
<p>Thematically, <i>Sympathy</i> follows an arc so faint it might as well be traced in sand, one that takes us from desire to fullness, from ""I wait for you"" to ""Hallelujah."" Her images are both hyper-specific and deeply symbolic, overdetermined by centuries of song: wilting willows, stardust, a golden fleece. The haunting ""Love Song"" offers only nonsense syllables punctuated by a few concrete phrases: ""blue zero,"" ""electricity,"" ""I am yours."" It feels like a snapshot of the mind/body divide: blood pumping through the veins, current zapping through the central nervous system, the occasional flash of language.</p>
<p>Herbst’s lyrics frequently take the shape of mantras or koans, but she seems aware that language has its expressive limitations. The text of ""Home"" is just five words long (""Stay with him/ I’m home"") and the closing ""Hymn"" even shorter: ""Hallelujah! Blood and water."" But words on the page are hardly the point. The magic is in the way she embodies them—in the idea of breath incarnate. In repetition, they take on the weight of ritual, and as she extemporizes, she frees the voice from the shackles of speech. The bulk of ""Home"" is an extended, wordless cadenza that loops in the air like a bird, only to finally alight on the phrase, ""I’m home.""</p>
<p>""I have recently been trying to build rhythms by imitating the way that light reflects on walls or leaves reflect on the ground,"" Herbst <a href=""http://exploringthemetropolis.org/2012/10/an-amalgamation-of-sounds-mixed-with-personal-fantasy-an-interview-with-gabrielle-herbst/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> an interviewer in 2012; ""constant fluctuation, random but with a sense of purpose and believability. I seek to make organic rhythms with an internal logic even if that logic is not obvious or straightforward."" In <i>Sympathy</i>, that takes the form of tidal forces: phrases imperceptibly speeding and slowing, and glassy depths turning roiled and opaque. ""Over to the sea!"" she cries in ""Fleece"", and in ""Falling"", she points to ""phosphorescence floating… love as debris."" In ""Da Void"", she addresses the sea and her lover as one being: ""Your eyes/ Your tides/ Breathing/ You still/ Water I want to hear you breathing."" Strings swell, and a fingerpicked guitar sends ripples across the surface. It’s so beautiful it’s almost frightening, a sneakily sweet treatise upon the sublime. There’s nothing to do but sigh.</p></div>"|20409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20409-sympathy/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

Her primary instrument is once again a Renaissance-era treble viola da gamba, and she does all she can to extend its conventional range of sounds, drawing direct inspiration from the studio techniques of dub masters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee ""Scratch"" Perry</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24001-king-tubby/"">King Tubby</a> for English-language songs featuring her own vocals.</p>
<p>The gut-string viola da gamba first appeared in the mid-15th century and it's seldom heard these days outside of early music ensembles. This general lack of use and natural versatility make the instrument difficult for modern ears to easily identify. When bowed, it can sound like a cello or a modern viola; when plucked or strummed, it can sound like a harp or lute; and when tapped or thumped, it can even sound something like a hammered dulcimer. Schott has made use of all of these techniques at various points, but on earlier albums such as 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11096-les-ondes-silencieuses/""><i>Les Ondes Silencieuses</i></a>, her playing style was more traditional and her compositions more closely centered on post-Baroque chamber music.</p>
<p>On <i>Captain of None</i>, however, Schott casts tradition aside and frequently uses her viola da gamba as a percussion instrument to create impressively rich, dub-inflected basslines. In live performance and on past records, she has used various samples, loops, and delay pedals to layer her voice and instruments back upon themselves. Here, on such tracks as ""This Hammer Breaks"" she pushes these techniques to a new level of invention, with the strings of her viola refracted beyond all recognition.</p>
<p>In fact, there are times on <i>Captain of None</i> where the album’s architecture is so compelling it's easy to miss the resonance of the songs themselves. But pieces like ""I’m Kin"" and the title track positively vibrate with melodic ideas, their lyrics filled with oblique little koans (""I’m kin to two stones making fire, I’m kin to melted ice giving water"").</p>
<p>The album’s dub influence is felt most strongly on the bass-heavy ""Eclipse"" or ""Salina Stars"", which is laced with an Augustus Pablo-style melodica. It’s tricky to make a true dub album without the benefit of an actual rhythm section, but Schott's hands-on production effects of delay and echo slip in and out through these songs like apparitions, projecting a sort of dub silhouette across the armature of the album. It is an impressive feat of reverse engineering, and the way Colleen uses classical acoustic instruments to reconfigure modern idioms recalls Arthur Russell’s cello-driven <i>World of Echo</i> or Hauschka’s house music variations on <i>Salon des Amateurs</i>. Somehow, Schott is able to make these disparate elements feel organic and effortless.</p></div>"|20400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20400-captain-of-none/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

But there’s something wistful about the latest variety. The synths have the sculpted plastic bigness of Aquanet coifs, the rhythms sway like prom dances, and the lyrics seem tailored toward movie makeouts (or at least heavy stares). It’s become the default sound for a certain rising artist: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8981-a-small-pop/"">think small-pop</a> as mall-pop. Even the world of mainstream pop is there: see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17290-charli-xcx-doing-it-ft-rita-ora/"">""Doing It""</a>, Charli XCX’s moon-eyed pastiche of ""Lucky Star"" and ""Crazy For You"", or Taylor Swift’s record named after and sounding just like <i>1989</i>, or Carly Rae Jepsen abandoning her prior tween squees for the Dev Hynes-produced prom slow dance <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59121-devonte-hynes-ariel-rechtshaid-perform-all-that-with-carly-rae-jepsen-on-saturday-night-live/"">""All That""</a>. Listening to the revivalists, one would be forgiven for thinking the entire decade took place entirely inside roller rinks, at night, during one long, teary last dance.</p>
<p>As the twin daughters of Steve Kilbey of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/757-the-church/"">the Church</a>, Elektra and Miranda Kilbey have a better connection to this side of the '80s than most. Their father's band is best known for the dreamily acoustic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWxJEIz7sSA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Under the Milky Way""</a>, but is also responsible between its members for <a href=""http://home.earthlink.net/~thechurch/side-projects/say-lou-lou.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a small pantheon of side projects</a>, most somewhere in the folk/dream pop realm. And the Kilbey sisters aren't new to the form either: they've trod the pop boards as Say Lou Lou (formerly Saint Lou Lou) since 2012, and at this point, their sound’s crystallized into a formula. The setting will be night, or at least dark: one early track was titled ""Better in the Dark"", and the sentiment’s repeated at least twice on <i>Lucid Dreaming</i>. Their voices will keen plaintively over the beat. The reverb will sound reverbed. Enough gold and glitter will flow through photography and lyrics to put Tinkerbell, El Dorado, and Kesha out of commission. Listen to more than a few of their songs, and these start seeming less like running motifs and more like a drinking game.</p>
<p>Whether this comes off as heady atmosphere or anemic samey blur depends mostly on how many tracks have passed in succession—their first label, <a href=""http://www.kitsune.fr/journal/labelsartists/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kitsuné</a>, is best known as a singles label—but there are some highs amid the fog. Opener ""Everything We Touch"" is as good a condensation of the Say Lou Lou sound as any: a midtempo track that sparkles like an ice palace, full of poetaster plaints (""there’s a ghost in the machine and there’s a glowing light"") that do indeed sound better in the dark. ""Glitter"" is among the more substantial cuts, a lite disco throb reminiscent of the highlights of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26824-little-boots/"">Little Boots</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17978-little-boots-nocturnes/"">Nocturnes</a></i>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, sonic departures are so few that they’re almost welcome merely for existing. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"">Lindstrøm</a> collaboration ""Games For Girls"" uses the twins’ breathy blankness to taunting effect: ""I never tell you what I’m thinking about/ I don’t do anything at all,"" they coo over Lindstrøm’s politely louche disco strut, and the effect is provocative if a bit obvious. Liam Howe-penned ""Peppermint"" churns the atmosphere into a storm swell: the foregrounded piano, strings, and whispers conjure enough heaving melodrama that the twins get across a truly silly central metaphor.</p>
<p>This isn’t necessarily a given. Early track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15184-julian/"">""Julian""</a> tries for plot, namely that of a young-adult dystopia—""I’ll get us through the checkpoint, I know we’ll be alright""—a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXVF8LBq4lY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Cracknellian conceit</a> undermined by the Kilbey twins singing it as if the car’s pumping out soma. The entire back half of the album is undeniably pretty in patches—some Eurythmics arpeggiation here, Robert Miles piano there, an obvious hook more or less—but otherwise an indistinguishable haze, put over neither by the bleary-pretty instrumentation or the twins’ somewhat thin voices.</p>
<p><i>Lucid Dreaming</i> arrives after a succession of delays: debut single <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/sayloulou/maybeyou"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Maybe You""</a> dates back to 2012, they made the BBC Sound of 2014 longlist for tracks that emerged in early 2013, and the new material on <i>Lucid Dreaming</i> isn’t much of a departure from those. For an act so consistent in their sound, it’s hard to get a bead on their ambitions. The chanted hook and big drums of ""Nothing But a Heartbeat"" suggest Top 40 hopes, but that ground’s been trod often and better. Say Lou Lou’s place would be something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31247-to-love/"">Tove Lo</a> without the biting lyrical voice, or maybe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4371-tegan-and-sara/"">Tegan and Sara</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17597-heartthrob/""><i>Heartthrob </i></a>without the rush of feelings or huge legacy fanbase. They could go full-on dance—a promising option, if not always as starmaking for female vocalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/706-edm-has-a-problem-with-women-and-its-getting-worse/"">than the usually-men behind the boards</a>. Or they could remain in their current blog-pop lane—a <a href=""http://time.com/47993/the-what-where-when-and-how-of-betty-who/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slow, steady path</a> with devotees to be found along the way. After all, nocturnal melancholia sounds glorious during the night. It's just that something’s got to happen once the lights come up. </p></div>"|20132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20132-lucid-dreaming/|5.8|Katherine St. Asaph

The Los Angeles native, who records and performs as Shlohmo, saw a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19675-jeremih-shlohmo-no-more-ep/"">collaborative EP with Jeremih</a> delayed for months by mismanagement at Def Jam. In July, the two artists gave up and released the record for free, only to receive lukewarm reviews. Laufer also suffered through some personal losses, ones that he’s done his best to keep private. He’s <a href=""http://www.passionweiss.com/2015/04/02/this-is-just-really-concrete-and-in-your-face-an-interview-with-shlohmo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spoken</a> of hospital visits and funerals, of partying too hard and feeling like shit whenever he took the time to make music.</p>
<p>His second full-length, <i>Dark Red</i>, channels that heavy energy. The album is jarringly different from Laufer’s past work and a difficult, oft-deafening listen. The emotional anguish contained in many of these tracks was hinted at on his 2013 solo EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17735-shlohmo-laid-out-ep/""><i>Laid Out</i></a>, but some internal dial has spun from ""ennui"" to ""cold rage."" The album’s third track, ""Buried"", is most representative, a near seven-minute piece of what could be called abyss-core. Its engine is a yearning sample, distorted into fragments and underscored with menacing guitar progressions. Shlohmo has always been a fan of distortion, but on <i>Dark Red</i> he’s beating his synths to hell, from the opening chords of ""Meet Ur Maker"", which contains a recognizable Shlohmo melody ripped to shreds, to the steel-drum-like plinks of  ""Remains"".</p>
<p>Shlohmo has <a href=""https://twitter.com/shlohmo/status/542441664321568769"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">testified</a> many times recently that he is looking to avoid the trappings of his more pop-leaning projects. Once, he made an avant-garde R&amp;B that resembled the production of mainstream foils like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>. Now he’s dabbling in ambient noise and prog with dashes of drum’n’bass and allusions to footwork. Vocals are gone, samples chopped and buried. Collaborations have largely been nixed: ""I just want to do my own fucking thing,"" Laufer said in <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/2015/02/20/an-afternoon-at-the-wedidit-office-with-shlohmo-groundislava-and-rl-grime/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent profile.</a></p>
<p>Fans of the producer’s older work may blanche at the aggression of the first three tracks here, which function as an aural ""Beware of Dog"" sign, warning the faint of heart away. Yet after repeated listens, the front trio reveals some of the best moments on the album, demanding attention but also meriting it. Those who want the old Shlohmo will have to wait for the final two tracks, ""Fading"" and ""Beams"", which concede to fans, and constitute a kind of middle ground between the producer’s past work and the new album.</p>
<p>If <i>Dark Red</i> were another EP, all that fury boiled down to a manageable five or six tracks might make an impressive statement. At an hour run-time, Shlohmo’s change in tenor loses its shock value and becomes a slog. The four tracks that make up the album’s mid-section are unmemorable, a fact that their names—""Apathy"", ""Relentless"", ""Ditch"", ""Remains""—seem to acknowledge explicitly. When the album’s rhythm finally picks up again on the drum and bass influenced ""Fading"", it comes as a major relief.</p>
<p>Los Angeles’s Low End Theory club was an early site of the alchemical process that has melded hip-hop kids and beatheads together into a formidable coalition. Laufer was a frequent attendee and in response he formed the <a href=""http://www.wediditcollective.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wedidit collective</a>, a group of producers including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31527-rl-grime/"">RL Grime</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30635-suicide-mission-ft-baths/"">Groundislava</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29376-salva/"">Salva</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30667-ryan-hemsworth/"">Ryan Hemsworth</a>. All of these artists were early in working with modern electronic dance genres that share the musical vocabulary and dynamism of hip-hop.</p>
<p>But the rest of the world has caught up with this style of music-making, so on<i> Dark Red, </i>Laufer is scrawling furiously outside the lines. Early in his career, before he dropped out of art school, he talked about music as a diversion, something that was less serious and less restrictive than learning how to paint the right way. His experiences with the mainstream and the colonization of his own genre seem to have had a similar effect. With <i>Dark Red</i>, he’s taken another turn, slipping out of the pop-shadowing path he was on in exchange for something darker and bolder, but compromised by its own disorder.</p></div>"|20447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20447-dark-red/|5.9|Jonah Bromwich

Elemental forces faced off in the form of nearly naked men and women hustling and tussling with each other in the squared circle. There was a good guy and a bad guy, and you cheered for one of them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Since Barthes’ time, professional wrestling has developed in more complex—and some purists would say less satisfying—ways. But John Darnielle, leader of the Mountain Goats, grew up with the old wrestling. ""These were comic-book heroes who existed in physical space,"" he writes of his formative fandom in the promotional copy for <i>Beat the Champ</i>, the band’s new album. ""I was a child. I needed them, and, every week, they came through for me."" Darnielle rooted for the heroes. His stepfather, who <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yzdkdOjZhc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he’s memorialized </a>as a troublesome if not frequently terrifying presence in many Mountain Goats songs, rooted for the villains.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Beat the Champ</i><span> is not about Darnielle’s relationship with his stepfather. Instead, it’s about those men and women who were the wrestlers of his childhood, and what they went through while bringing him and children like him their weekly entertainment. These wrestlers don’t make appearances </span><a href=""http://www.today.com/popculture/wwe-champ-seth-rollins-puts-today-anchors-ring-after-big-2D80577352"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>on ""Today""</span></a><span>. Like the hero of ""Southwestern Territory"", they suffer long drives between sleepy towns for the promise of a few bucks and a patchy broadcast on black-and-white TV. Darnielle crawls inside their heads, his voice switching between his recognizably nasal drill and a tender lower register as he chronicles their camaraderie and willingness to hurl their bodies into each other.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Mountain Goats have been a proper band for more than a decade, and Darnielle is once again backed by the sturdy rhythm section of Peter Hughes and Jon Wurster, who push him forward without getting in his way. The horns from 2012’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17112-transcendental-youth/""><i>Transcendental Youth</i></a><span> return on ""Foreign Object"", in which Darnielle acts out a promo</span>—those speeches where wrestlers shout threats and taunts at each other—by vowing that he ""personally will stab you in the eye"" with an improvised shiv made from tape.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The rest of the record isn’t as brassy as ""Foreign Object"", an obvious crowd-pleaser, but it’s occasionally as bold. Darnielle’s exhortations on ""Choked Out"" channel the bloodlust of a wrestler ready to risk it all for fame. The down-tuned, menacing ""Werewolf Gimmick"" echoes ""Psalms 40:2"" from 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13483-the-life-of-the-world-to-come/""><i>The Life of the World to Come </i></a>as it eulogizes those ""nameless bodies in unremembered rooms,"" the arrangement rumbling like a car coming apart at the screws. ""Stabbed to Death Outside San Juan"", which loosely tells the story of real-life wrestler Bruiser Brody (who, yes, was stabbed to death outside San Juan) unfolds like a radio play, as Darnielle’s speak-song delivery is intermittently interrupted by a tremendous crash of strings and organs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">These songs describe the psychological states of the wrestlers (""I try to remember what life was like long ago/ But it’s gone, you know?"", from ""Southwestern Territory"") but they also find ways to fit into the mythology of Darnielle’s life. That tyrannical stepfather does pop up on lead single ""The Legend of Chavo Guerrero"", which narrates the title character's life from Darnielle's young eyes. The case for Chavo as Darnielle’s personal hero is as earnest as it is heart-tugging, and it explains why he made this record: ""You let me down, but Chavo never once did/ You called him names to try to get beneath my skin/ Now your ashes are scattered on the wind.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One of Darnielle’s premier talents as a musician is his ability to cast personal mantras as singalong anthems. At his best, his songs feel as essential as water. Mountain Goats fans will testify to the healing powers of standing arm-to-arm with hundreds of people while shouting <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetIgGXH6DA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I am going to make it through this year if it kills me.""</a> <i>Beat the Champ</i>, however, eschews universality by coming from such a specific point of view. You don't necessarily need to know what a heel turn is in order to connect with ""Heel Turn 2"", but it doesn't hurt. </p>
<p>There’s a noble simplicity to these songs, though, reflecting Darnielle’s warm memories of his wrestling fandom. The respect he has for these men and women, and what they must have been through, is obvious. On ""Unmasked!"", a wrestler sings to his costumed opponent, whom he's about to defeat and subsequently unmask before the world. For wrestlers who choose to perform with a mask, hiding their real face is everything. To reveal it is an incredibly serious act. But the pressure of maintaining this illusion for the dwindling crowds has gotten to this anonymous masked man, who is ready to move on. ""By way of honoring the things we once both held dear, I will reveal you,"" his opponent sings. When you’re a kid, what’s happening on TV isn’t very complicated. Then, you grow up and learn the truth.</p></div>"|20381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20381-beat-the-champ/|6.6|Jeremy Gordon

And <a href=""http://www.strut-records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strut</a> hasn’t done that with the fourth volume of their <i>Next Stop Soweto</i> series. But in adding a fourth volume to the original three, the label has inched a step closer to focusing the musical kaleidoscope of 1960s and '70s South Africa into a coherent image. Perhaps 10 volumes from now, they’ll complete the trick. The first three sets focused, respectively, on mbaqanga and other township sounds, psychedelia and soul, and jazz. This one picks up most clearly where <i>Vol. 2</i> left off, following the march of underground psych and soul into the disco era. In the process, it gives us a glimpse at the South Africa that grooved under apartheid’s heel; there aren’t attention-grabbing headlines in it, but people find a way to live and have a good time in even the most oppressive circumstances. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In spite of the series title, not all of the music was made in Soweto, the sprawling city that grew organically on the edge of officially white Johannesburg. Likewise, while economic stratification in South Africa during this period was severe, don’t come expecting something too gritty—this is hi-fi music recorded on good gear. It’s also almost entirely unknown outside of the communities it was made for; most of these bands don’t yield much information when you look them up online. The pop music of South Africa, for whatever reason, hasn’t received as much attention from Western reissue labels as West and East Africa, so most listeners will find themselves getting acquainted with a whole lot of artists they’ve never heard of before.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Almost all of them had something hot to offer, though. The Drive’s ""Ain’t Sittin’ Down Doin’ Nothing"" is a crunching funk instrumental with dive-bombing Moog and a slow-burning horn section, Abafana Bama Soul offers funk underpinned by the four-on-the-floor thump and bouncing basslines of mbaqanga, and the Movers’ ""Soweto Disco"" sounds like an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14686-earth-wind-fire/"">Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</a> on-stage jam. Saitana’s group backing vocals on ""1,2,3"" cloak a pointed political message (""One, two, three, your turn is over/ ...our turn has started"") in disco glitter, and the song builds tension and release with odd key changes and unexpected melodic shifts that mirror the message.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">During this period South Africans were steeped in American sounds, and the English-descended white population, which tended to be more anti-apartheid and more likely to associate with the black population than the Boer-descended Afrikaners, was well-connected to the British music scene, a connection that sometimes bled over sonically into the townships. Kabasa’s ""Unga Pfula a Chi Pfalo"" is charging heavy funk, but the guitar seems to be on loan from some British hard rock band, and it gives the song a nasty, ass-kicking edge. The cold synths of Damara’s ""Mmamakhabtha"" have an affinity with new romantic synth-pop and sound oddly up-to-date in a post-chillwave world.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The excitement of hearing all these tracks for the first time is bolstered somewhat by knowing that this is just a first pass at South Africa’s disco era; there is a lot more to unearth and reassess. If there’s a chink in the armor here, it’s that the sheer amount of music there is to uncover from this place and time suggests that a generalist compilation may ultimately be a less effective way to explore it than to go deeper into the individual scenes and recording companies to find the stories that underlie the music. Nevertheless, <i>Next Stop Soweto Vol. 4</i> is another well-assembled look at lesser-known music from a very complicated time and place.</p></div>"|20309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20309-next-stop-soweto-vol-4-zulu-rock-afro-disco-mbaqanga-1975-1985/|8.3|Joe Tangari

As of now, it’s Gary McClure’s project and his alone, but the songs won’t require a lot of maintenance to be ready for the road: guitars, bass, piano and vocals are layered about the same way they would have if American Wrestlers were just four guys in a cheap studio. But there’s always that rigid, so on-the-beat-it’s-actually-<i>off </i>thwack of a snare, a bass drum that sounds like a blown subwoofer and the occasional hint of McClure hitting the power switch on the thing—all reminders that American Wrestlers is McClure starting a rock band with his imaginary friends.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1785179/band-to-watch-american-wrestlers-theres-no-one-crying-over-me-either-stereogum-premiere/franchises/band-to-watch/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Until about a month ago</a>, American Wrestlers was in fact a pointedly anonymous project, an attention-seeking tactic that went out of fashion right about the time <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a> went public.  The music feels a few steps behind the times as well, but that's a major component of its charm. Perhaps coincidentally, the album shares some of the best qualities of Fat Possum's major 2011 releases: the dog-eared alt-rock melodies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"">Yuck</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck"">debut</a>; the lo-fi, low-end thump of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29667-youth-lagoon/"">Youth Lagoon</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15873-the-year-of-hibernation"">The Year of Hibernation</a>; </i>the (also formerly incognito) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28890-unknown-mortal-orchestra/"">Unknown Mortal Orchestra</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15539-unknown-mortal-orchestra"">oddball psych odysseys</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the promo-cycle theatrics, the songs themselves tend to make strong first impressions. McClure leads songs off with breezy guitar leads, memorable titles become indelible lyrics, choruses make satisfying, expected leaps. And despite its disheveled exterior, McClure’s lyrics generate positive energy out of bad vibes: ""There’s No One Crying Over Me Either"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17236-american-wrestlers-i-can-do-no-wrong/"">""I Can Do No Wrong""</a> respectively turn self-pity and a lack of introspection into superpowers.</p>
<p>There’s no simple genre tag for American Wrestlers, though singles ""Kelly"" and ""I Can Do No Wrong"" imagine an alternate history where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"">Phoenix</a> started their career as Tascam 4-trackers. The grubby production appears to be a product of necessity, the natural result of <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/03/30/stream-american-wrestlers-debut-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">McClure’s rudimentary equipment and skills</a> rather than an allegiance to lo-fi aesthetics, but it still lends <i>American Wrestlers</i> a distinct character: The 12-string sparkle of ""I Can Do No Wrong"" gets toned down just enough to not be blinding. And had the singles been given a properly sync-ready production, you might already be tired of hearing them from a commercial for macrobrews or luxury sedans.</p>
<p>The highlights of <i>American Wrestlers</i> reveal themselves immediately, but elsewhere on the record McClure demonstrates a curious ability to bury concise hooks in otherwise-doughy or unfinished songs. The contrast between the southern rock lead of ""Holy"" and its passages of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">National</a>-esque piano is intriguing on first exposure; it is not enough intrigue to sustain a six-minute song on its own. ""Wild Yonder"" evokes the ear-turning pitter-patter of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3902-sparklehorse/"">Sparklehorse</a>’s balladry and would’ve served as a nice shift in tone had it been three minutes, but it goes on for nearly twice that long.</p>
<p>This pattern repeats itself on the album's Side B, when ""Kelly"" is followed by ""Left"" and ""Cheapshot"", 18 minutes of music that you can hear straining for ""epic"" but fail to generate any real volume dynamics or textural motion. These shots at a bigger sound only end up fully demonstrating the limitations of McClure’s compositional methods.</p>
<p>It's in these moments where it occurs to you that the biggest problem with a solo project is that there's no one there to tell you ""no."" At some point during the ponderous stretches of ""Wild Yonder"" or ""Cheapshot"" or ""Left"", perhaps McClure would've noticed someone else in the band starting to drift off or suggested that maybe he should get to the chorus more quickly. ""I Can Do No Wrong"" may be a highlight on <i>American Wrestlers, </i>but the title sentiment is his project's Achilles heel.</p></div>"|20285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20285-american-wrestlers/|6.9|Ian Cohen

<div class=""gmail_default"">
<p dir=""ltr"">On his debut album, 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17795-lapalux-nostalchic/""><i>Nostalchic</i></a>, producer Stuart Howard (aka Lapalux) showed a strong affection for 1990s R&amp;B. He sifted the era's body-rolling sensuality through computerized filters, piecing the threads into cryptic slow jams and bastardized dance tracks. His music, across <i>Nostalchic</i> and several EPs, thrives on a patchwork approach, a mismatched blend of glued-together tape strands, heavy drums, and warped vocals. It's wonky enough to fit alongside that of <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> label mates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/989-daedelus/"">Daedelus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"">Gaslamp Killer</a>, but it's distinguished by a cosmopolitan sophistication, conjuring images of pretty people in dark clubs, sipping mixed drinks in trendy clothes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The producer establishes a more aquatic vibe throughout sophomore album <i>Lustmore</i>. The compositions are more straightforward than those on <i>Nostalchic</i>, merging saxophones and billowing synths with results resting somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"">James Blake</a>'s sparsity and early 2000s neo-soul. ""We Lost"", in particular, resembles a Musiq Soulchild track—the instrumental is decidedly Soulquarian; the vocals are mostly indecipherable. ""Whenever I think about the album I think about the bar scene in <i>The Shining</i>,"" Howard told FACT in January, speaking of <i>Lustmore</i>. ""There's something about that strange, hallucinatory psychological madness that relates to the music."" To that end, <i>Lustmore</i> doesn't really move; it lingers like dense fog until it slowly dissolves.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In a way, the disoriented mood better aligns with another Kubrick flick—1999's </span><i>Eyes Wide Shut</i><span>. </span><span> </span>But <i>Lustmore</i> suffers from a lack of coherence. Its various feint and detours feel purposeful, but the album buckles under the weight of Howard's ambition, leading to a leading to a disjointed listen. Sultry numbers like ""U Never Know"" and ""Closure"" fit into Howard's overall aesthetic, but the mix of straight-ahead singing and woozy ambience feels outdated and timid alongside the more fluid, strange ""Sum Body"" and ""Midnight Peelers"". </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The guest singers aren’t filtered so heavily, which makes for an easier listen, yet the output feels staid compared with his previous offerings, where he achieved the right mix of airy and bizarre.<i>Nostalchic</i> was tough to get into, but there was a certain charm to Howard’s esoteric style that set him apart. <i>Lustmore</i> doesn’t feel honed in; it sounds like a vast collection of songs that never quite go anywhere. Much like <i>The Shining</i>, there’s no telling what you’ll get from one scene to the next on <i>Lustmore</i>, but it ultimately ends with a thud.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Howard shows flashes of ingenuity on <i>Lustmore</i>'s ""Don't Mean a Thing"", the album's most realized offering. Here, Howard finds a nice groove and stays put, looping the vocals into sporadic bursts while forgoing the stilted patterns of other songs—namely ""Push N' Spun"" and ""Make Money"". On ""1004"", Howard builds a nice shape-shifting atmosphere; the track smoothly transitions into a spacey upbeat gem that punctuates the LP. Ultimately, though, it's tough to discern just what <i>Lustmore</i> aims to be. It's dubbed as a hypnagogic release, but in Howard's quest to explore the void between sleep and alertness, the album frequently veers off the path, leaving me to wonder if there were clear directions to begin with. Instead of a full movie, <i>Lustmore</i> is a collection of half-edited scenes that don't quite gel.</p>

Judging from that image, you wouldn't be faulted for assuming the band's debut, <i>This World Is Not Enough</i>, may end up being the unintentional comedy album of the year, but looking at Rønnenfelt’s track record, it's worth indulging him for a quick minute.</p>
<p>As the frontman for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a>, he’s carried the Danish punk firebrands across three good-to-great albums, from the wild-eyed pummel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15576-new-brigade/"" target=""_blank""><i>New Brigade</i></a> through last year’s curveball <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19806-iceage-plowing-into-the-field-of-love/"" target=""_blank""><i>Plowing Into the Field of Love</i></a>, which offered country-informed punk rave-ups as well as desperately drunken ballads, all with uncommonly successful results. Now with Marching Church, which has been around in some capacity since 2010, Rønnenfelt seems to be doubling down on <i>Field of Love</i>’s risk-taking, enlisting members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30458-lower/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Lower</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32374-puce-mary/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Puce Mary</a>, and others for an improvisational avant-garde LP that stretches the boundaries of the soul recordings (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">James Brown</a>, Sam Cooke) that inspired it.</p>
<p>How you approach <i>This World Is Not Enough</i>, and how patient a listener you consider yourself to be, will factor heavily in your enjoyment of it. ""Well I’m still being convinced that I contain some kind of godlike charm,"" Rønnenfelt croaks over the rapture-heralding drums and slashing guitars of opener ""Living In Doubt"", and it's often hard to disagree with him. As on <i>Field of Love</i>, he cuts a striking figure, a confident but conflicted young man who rambles like a junior year philosophy major in the throes of a fever dream. And while his rakish sexuality and winking sense of humor are on display once again, this time he seems to have crawled a little too far into his own head.</p>
<p>He holds off for approximately two songs—including the great, sax-laden <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/59062-marching-church-iceages-elias-bender-rnnenfelt-share-king-of-song-video/"" target=""_blank"">""King of Song""</a>, which kind of sounds like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" as performed by people who’ve never actually heard ""Sympathy for the Devil""—before going off-the-rails. So, just as quickly as things seem to be shaping up for <i>This World Is Not Enough</i>, ""Hungry for Love""—a seven minute panic attack of clattering cymbals, strained strings, and Rønnenfelt's trademark mad spouting—rears its head. It’s fascinating but also purposefully repellent, a moment when the idea of self-indulgence threatens to mutate into a wildly pretentious guilty pleasure. From here on, the record follows ""Hungry for Love""’s lead, and it never quite finds its way back.</p>
<p>And yet, <i>This World Is Not Enough</i> displays little moments of greatness amid the chaos and confusion. You’ll have to wade through almost five soupy minutes of rusty bells, anguished moaning, and hovering guitars on ""Your Father’s Eyes"" before being rewarded with a soulful, horn-assisted death waltz, though it’s a nice reward anyway. But, all said, there’s just too much wide open space to fill here, and especially on the album’s draggy back half, it’s fairly clear that Rønnenfelt and company have absolutely no idea what to fill it with, but decide to try anyways.</p>
<p>This usually means more shapeless, frequently unpleasantly calamitous dicking around from the players, and more moaning from Rønnenfelt. (It can also mean a painfully dull cover of the eternal <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC3AXQ8dPJM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Dark End of the Street""</a>.) And while he is often quite good at conjuring up vividly disquieting imagery, it’s rarely enough to keep your attention. But somehow, <i>This World Is Not Enough</i> is too cluelessly conceived and sloppily executed to get very mad about it. What is frustrating are the infrequent but genuinely interesting moments of creativity and cohesion, which suggest that if Marching Church had taken their time and laid off the improv a little, there might have been something special here.</p></div>"|20436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20436-this-world-is-not-enough/|5.6|Zach Kelly

Three years ago, the Baltimore band’s standout single ""Brains"" shone as a melodic gem inside the largely experimental <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16555-nootropics/""><i>Nootropics</i></a>; now, on the band’s third album, core songwriter Jana Hunter embraces open, ringing melodies. Like a lot of current music, <i>Escape From Evil</i> siphons its aesthetic from the storied pop of the '80s, but it’s not content to stop at homage. Lower Dens use the past—its clichés and its innocence—as a lens through which to imagine a queer and open future.</p>
<p>As an aesthetic reservoir, the '80s continue to feed an abundance of nostalgia, from the American highway fantasies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">the War on Drugs</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow/"">Twin Shadow</a>’s boy-meets-girl melodramas. Inhabiting characters from the past can lend a singer a certain gravitas; unburdened by modern irony, big emotions play bigger on a decades-old frame. But few artists have seized that retrospection as an opportunity to flip the power dynamics that governed pop culture 30 years ago. For Lower Dens, a neon palette serves as fertile ground for subversion. Hunter absorbs the range of gendered feeling from Billy Idol to Bonnie Tyler, emerging as a bandleader capable of flipping effortlessly between extremes of masculine aggression and feminine yearning.</p>
<p>The word ""genderfluid"" didn’t exist 30 years ago, but it’s a useful term for gripping the edges of this new work. The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2iSVHh_Wn8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for the album’s lead single ""To Die in L.A."" works almost as a queer retelling of William Friedkin’s 1985 drama <i>To Live and Die in L.A.</i>, complete with characters that aren’t cast based on their actors’ birth-assigned gender. Hunter appears as a masculine presence in a buzz cut and suit to glower at the video’s lead femme, who’s vying for movie stardom; in the clip’s last image, the main character sets fire to a painting of herself, then she and Hunter gaze into the flames as it burns away. </p>
<p>The video is full of ambiguous, evocative imagery, and <i>Escape From Evil</i> also runs thick with powerful, slippery emotions. While Hunter seems more enamored of radio hits by the likes of Gary Numan and Flock of Seagulls here, Lower Dens never quite settle into an easy genre hook. A krautrock chug left over from 2012’s <i>Nootropics</i> powers ""Company"", where Hunter assumes the role of anonymous authority figure with lines like ""you look really uncomfortable if I might be honest"" and ""we just want to help."" You can hear the same smirk that Mike Patton wore on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezAoxiLQRd0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Faith No More’s ""Land of Sunshine""</a>, the same glee in inhabiting a vague malice disguised as aid. </p>
<p>Hunter is a charismatic singer willing to deal in grand, sweeping gestures and also idiosyncratic specifics. <i>Escape From Evil </i>is a vivid world of queer retrofuturism, a wide open space that offers access the emotionality of the recent past without subscribing to its violence.

Since 2010, Luis Vasquez of the Soft Moon has twisted his personal demons into songs, quietly breathing new life into gothy post-punk. On his new album, <i>Deeper</i>, he pushes his foreboding synth-pop even further.</p>
<p>Given the nature of Vasquez’s music, it’s almost too perfect that <i>Deeper</i> was recorded in seclusion in the mountains of Italy at a studio simply called Hate. Even though the Soft Moon has always essentially been a one-man show, the tracks on <i>Deeper</i> are light years beyond the fuzzy bedroom recordings on the project’s 2010 debut. Working alongside producer Maurizio Baggio, Vasquez has married his old school goth pop sensibilities (imagine a dalliance between NIN’s <i>The Downward Spiral</i>, Depeche Mode’s <i>Black Celebration</i>, and Chris &amp; Cosey’s <i>Songs of Love and Lust</i>) with production that positions the album firmly in the now. He still lays a thick sonic fog over these tracks but the songs operate with a kind of icy precision, leading to a record is both unrelentingly dark and amazingly fastidious. </p>
<p>Like its predecessors, <i>Deeper</i> leans more heavily on overall mood than it does on obvious hooks, but there are catchy moments. “Far” is the kind of hyper-morose electro pop that wouldn’t have been out of place making kids pogo at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcave_%28club%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Batcave</a> back in the early ’80s, while “Wrong” has the kind of jackhammering synths and stuttering beats that could have dropped off an old Nitzer Ebb single. But <i>Deeper</i> is more than a collection of cleverly assembled references. It splits the difference between the more glacial dirges (“Without”, “Wasting”) and intricately-layered synth tracks (“Feel”, “Black”) without feeling too turgid or weighed down by the record’s decidedly bleak subject matter.</p>
<p>Vasquez himself remains a kind of cipher—a detached vocal presence too often content to float along the periphery of the songs. When he abandons the processed vocals or the Reznor-esque sing/speak and let’s his voice come through, the results are often surprising. On “Wasting” when he ominously intones “You’ve gotta take life by the hand/ Let the substance close you in/ Hope to one day come alive,” it provides what is one of the album’s few moments of emotional reprieve. And the record occasionally suffers a fate common to aggressively “dark” music—the lyrics, though undoubtedly deeply personal, tread a fine line between effectively bracing and the stuff of bad teenage poetry.</p>
<p>Occasional goth clichés aside, <i>Deeper </i>is a thing of beauty. Few contemporary artists have managed such a clever reimagining of post-punk and spooky new wave in a way that sounds both familiar and somehow fresh. Nowhere on <i>Deeper</i> is this more evident than on the album’s closing track, “Being”, a six-minute stunner that builds from bits of collaged tape loops and whispers before evolving into a pulsing industrial track and ultimately exploding into a wall of white noise as Vasquez screams “I can’t see my face/ I don’t know where I am.” For an artist who seems hell-bent on finding new ways to take listeners somewhere both beautiful and frightening, the song’s final three minutes of hiss and roiling noise seems like a perfectly appropriate place to end up.</p></div>"|20411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20411-deeper/|7.8|T.

(He is now a two-time Fast &amp; Furious franchise cast member.) Regardless, it was an accurate, if incomplete, descriptor: In the early-’00s glory days of throwback jerseys and meticulous cornrows, Ludacris led a wave of Atlanta-helmed rap into crossover success, transforming dancefloors around the world into microcosms of the city’s sound. Without staunchly regionalist classics like the libidinous Shawnna-starring “What’s Your Fantasy” and instant mosh pit starter “Southern Hospitality”, there would likely be no so-called New Atlanta, the catchall term for the landscape of boundlessly engaging rappers like Future, Migos, and Father’s Awful Records crew.</p>
<p>Ludacris’ ninth album, <i>Ludaversal</i>, is his first in five years, and it’s a not-very-subtle attempt at testing his staying power against this backdrop. “They say Luda don't want it no mo’ / Nah, nigga, I'm as hungry as the first day,” he raps on the album’s opener, over a double-time beat courtesy of David Banner. I’m still here, seems to be the 37-year-old’s<i> cri de coeur</i> on <i>Ludaversal</i>, as he meditates on the music industry and his place within it.</p>
<p>Luda is one of the most technically inventive rappers of his era, with lithe, adaptable flows, but he emerges on <i>Ludaversal</i> as an unlikely hip-hop traditionalist, at times sounding like an ""Empire"" approximation of himself. Despite production from current-day heavy hitters like Da Internz and Mike WiLL Made It, he still comes off like a relic from the past, the class clown who never quite grew up. When they don’t land, the jokes and double-entendres are egregious, landing with a practically audible <i>Amirite</i>? Notable example: “I leave rappers confused like Will.i.am’s barber” on “Beast Mode.” Sandwiched in the album’s first half, apropos of nothing, is a skit called “Viagra”, a recording of a 911 phone call placed by a man with an ostensibly never-ending erection.</p>
<p>There are some high points, though: In interviews Luda has described the project as his most personal yet—that’s often a marketing phrase bandied about too generously, but it rings true in this case. On songs like “Grass Is Always Greener” and “Charge It to the Rap Game,” he grapples with the downsides of fame; for every luxury he can afford, he has to contend with a money-grubbing family member or a vicious press mechanism that feeds on celebrity gossip. “Ocean Skies,” a song about his father’s fatal alcoholism and his own struggles with substance abuse, is the album's centerpiece, but, like much of <i>Ludaversal</i>, the value is in his emotional honesty, not his execution.</p>
<p>Rap fans with memories of the early ‘00s will always have a fondness for Ludacris, and it’s hard not to want to root for him. It’s never a <i>bad</i> thing, exactly, to hear his voice on a track, even a silly one. But on <i>Ludaversal</i>, I can’t help but think of Young Thug’s casual yet searing critique of Jay Z in a recent GQ interview: ""If you're 30, 40 years old, you're not getting listened to by minors.”</p></div>"|20373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20373-ludaversal/|5.3|Rawiya Kameir

There’s probably a deep and worthy discussion to be had somewhere in there, but the Sonics don’t give a shit about that, nor should they. The Tacoma band’s new release <i>This Is the Sonics</i> is their first studio album of all-new material in 49 years, and that fact alone is staggering. What’s even more remarkable, though, is how one of garage rock’s most legendary bands has dared to test their legend by making a record that spits, snarls, drools, honks, wails, and screams as if it were 1966 all over again.</p>
<p>Granted, recording with Jim Diamond doesn’t hurt. The former Dirtbombs bassist and famed producer of the White Stripes’ self-titled debut spares no grime or fuzz. The album was recorded mono, live in the studio. “Bad Betty”, the most powerful original composition on the album, hints at the rock-appropriated folklore of Black Betty in its title while remaining gleefully ignorant of anything except how to pound a riff into the ground in execution. Vocalist/keyboardist <span id=""docs-internal-guid-fff4149d-7bff-0ca4-c882-e24005eea903""><span>Jerry Roslie</span></span> sings of the wild, leather-clad woman who puts his own savagery to shame, the septeguenarian whooping and screeching like a tomcat in heat.</p>
<p> Roslie is joined by fellow founding members Larry Parypa on guitar and vocals and Rob Lind on saxophone and vocals; the lineup is rounded out by bassist Freddie Dennis (a veteran of the Kingsmen, one of the Sonics’ Pacific Northwest garage-rock brethren in the ’60s) and drummer Dusty Watson. Together they lock into a single-minded, almost monomaniacal unit, pulverizing numbers like “Be a Woman” and “Spend the Night” into lumps of distorted, house-wrecking lust. Roslie’s voice, though, is the star. Still steeped in the R&amp;B of his youth, his corroded pipes—which produced godlike shrieks on ’60s Sonics classics like “Strychnine”, “The Witch”, and “Have Love Will Travel”—sound somehow rawer.</p>
<p>R&amp;B informed the Sonics’ unhinged passion from the get-go, and <i>This Is the Sonics</i> pays proper homage to the group’s roots. Willie Dixon’s “You Can’t Judge a Book by the Cover”—by way of Bo Diddley’s iconic version—is given a giddy workout, with Lind’s sax squawking nauseously over a jackhammer backbeat. Eddie Holland’s “Leaving Here” gets similar treatment; the fact that it’s one of garage rock’s most threadbare standards doesn’t keep the Sonics from putting a fresh coat of paint on it. The best cover on the album, though, is of Hank Ballard and the Midnighters’ “Look at Little Sister”, whose hoot-and-holler horniness is rendered simultaneously sleazy and boyish. Less successful is a rendition of The Kinks' “The Hard Way”, which the Sonics rip through a little too quickly for the melody to survive intact.  </p>
<p>No song on <i>This Is the Sonics</i> summarizes the band’s grizzled, miraculous resurrection like “Save the Planet”. In it, they thumb their noses at the hippie platitudes that helped render garage rock (briefly) extinct in the ’60s; Parypa’s bluesy, sneering riff is more of a taunt than a hook, and Roslie makes it crystal clear why he believes Earth should be preserved: “We have to save the planet / It’s the only one with beer!” King Khan, one of the Sonics’ most faithful spiritual offspring, couldn’t have put it better himself. The Sonics’ children are legion, and every generation of garage rockers owes them. Roslie and crew surely know this, but from the timeless sound of <i>This Is the Sonics</i>, they might just as well be oblivious to their legacy. Legacies are for the dead. The Sonics are alive and viciously well.</p></div>"|20212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20212-this-is-the-sonics/|7.5|Jason Heller

But since relocating to Toronto in 2012, Rault has been acting more like the high-school heartthrob with straight-A grades and football-scholarship potential who ditched class to drop acid with the freaks beneath the bleachers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After sharing bills and making friends with local eccentrics like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19363-slim-twig/"">Slim Twig</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29681-us-girls/"">U.S. Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19632-actual-water-call-4-fun/"">Actual Water</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20241-ripe-4-luv/"">Young Guv</a>, it's probably no coincidence that Rault’s hair has gotten longer and greasier, his clothes more torn, and his face more razor-resistant. But most importantly, his traditionalism has been corrupted into wonderfully woozy, glitter-speckled power pop. Rault’s recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19810-king-tuff-black-moon-spell/"">Tuffened</a>-up sound makes him a natural fit on the roster of California’s Burger Records, a veritable Disneyland for retro-gazing rough-cat rockers. While <i>Living Daylight</i> was initially released last year in Canada on Pirates Blend in seven-song EP form, this enlarged 10-song version is being promoted by Burger as Rault’s proper introduction to the world. (His current website noticeably <a href=""http://michaelrault.com/music/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">downplays</a> his earlier discography.) </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Rault belongs to a growing legion of modern-day garage-spawned rockers—The Smith Westerns and Foxygen among them—who seem less interested in mining the standard British Invasion/Nuggets/CBGB continuum than the phenomena that sprung up between those movements: bubblegum, glam, Rundgrenian soft-rock, solo-Beatle solipsism. Recorded partially at home and in an Edmonton studio with Rault’s cousin Renny Wilson,<i> Living Daylight </i>strikes a playfully wobbly balance between in-the-room rawness and cerebral strangeness. And when Rault pounces on the fuzz pedal—like on the T. Rex boogie of “Real Love (Yeah)” or the Plastic Ono blues of “Hiding From a Heartache”—the ensuing distortion feels less decorative than rhythmic, like the subliminal rev of a car motor. Rault’s simple lyrics sound as if they belong to a more innocent era, but while he may stick to tried ‘n’ true themes of looking for love and/or losing it, he’s as adept at conveying the hormonal frustration of the former (the taut, soul-stompin’ “All Alone (On My Own)”) as the crestfallen pathos of the latter (the lush, candlelit ballad “Lovers Lie”).</p>
<p>The three additional tracks on this new edition are dropped right into the middle of the original tracklisting, and they reinforce the perception that the record’s strongest songs are still its original ones. The expanded format is more of an opportunity for Rault to retrofit some of his back catalogue with his new sound: “I Wanna Love You” toughens up a sock-hop romp from Rault’s 2010 debut <i>Ma-Me-O</i>, while the sneering  ""Suckcess"" is thrust into a “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3PznrYmWzc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeepster</a>” drag race. But Rault’s experimentation never tips over into excess: with songs kept to a tight three-minute average, and the singer’s winsome way with melody anchoring each, <i>Living Daylight</i> shows that it’ll take more than unkempt hair and production trickery to obscure Rault’s essential charms.</p></div>"|20347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20347-living-daylight/|7.3|Stuart Berman

That sly flip—the thrill and release in activating anger—is the emotional ingenuity in Jlin’s music. It’s a certain mindfulness she has in common with Rick Owens, who used her music—and that of pioneering footworker RP Boo—for his </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0HG0Gutvw4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>FW 2014/15 Paris Fashion Week show</span></a><span>. Grim, monochrome upper; mind-altering interior.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Dark Energy</i> has all the hallmarks of footwork—its frenzied pacing, arrhythmic kick drums, a graphic command of blank space—executed with clear-eyed self-determination. This gives the album an opaque, thoughtful quality. It's Jlin’s first release, centered around a track that first went live in 2010 (""Erotic Heart""), which means she’s had time to think about what she’s doing and, more importantly, what she is <i>not</i> doing. While working shifts at one of Gary’s many large steel mills, Jlin spent months perfecting the music, including songs like ""Guantanamo"",  which cleaves hair-raising dialogue from <i>The Ring</i> with a grip of pin-sharp synths. Her tenacity feels even more significant when you consider that she’s a woman working in the man-saturated field of electronic production, and footwork in particular. For women, producer’s anonymity is both gift and curse.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A bunch of these song titles also invite loose contemplation on narratives of blackness, and/or racialized peoples. ""Black Diamond"" and “Black Ballet” scan more literally, whereas songs like “Guantanamo,” “Ra” and “Mansa Musa” prompt ideas about history, mythology, imprisonment, culture wars and a clash of civilizations. Jlin doesn’t editorialize, and this record isn’t specifically about identity politics. But she’s from Gary, a blue collar, black-majority city, making a record within a genre created for and by African-Americans at a time when the non-white citizenry is growing increasingly restless and hella loud about owning its art and likeness, its safety and life expectancy. <i>Dark Energy</i> has absorbed some of the shock. It has knowledge of self. Throw it onto the list of recent albums, like Heems’ <i>Eat Pray Thug </i>and Kendrick Lamar’s <i>To Pimp A Butterfly, </i>that<i> </i>take personal, political and temporal stock of our lives and refuse to be one-dimensional in chronicling these experiences.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This sense of brooding becomes music that feels venomous. ""Mansa Musa""—the name of a prominent ruler and cultural benefactor of the Mali Empire—clarifies <i>Dark Energy</i>’s happy-scary tension best.</span><span> Halfway through the album, its fizzy, midtempo gait feels like a break from the intensity. But it’s a feint. Effervescent synths and skeletal drums lift the song up only to have a descending bassline and stiff snares prick its rise, sending it flopping to its death like a deflated balloon.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-1715a2d7-70f7-a10e-f498-b833f65b3487""><span>With the exception of vocal snippets, which appear frequently, Jlin doesn’t bother with traditional sampling. She’s generated her own instrumentation: from the winding, symphonic piano loop that opens the album on ""Black Ballet"" and the atonal moan of a Chinese erhu violin on ""Unknown Tongues"" to the guttural synths that skim the bottom of ""Ra"". Like Jlin it’s unconventional, particularly within footwork. Her homespun mutation of the genre feels like she’s staging an interrogation, and there’s the sense of threat: What do you feel when you hear the hollowed-out militant stomp and shiver of ""Black Diamond""? What physical realm does this song slip into and out of as pinched, tweaked-out synths whirr ecstatically to life then stop? Are you having fun yet?</span></span></p></div>"|20450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20450-dark-energy/|8.5|Anupa Mistry

<p>Gibbard’s desire to write from a less personal standpoint is understandable, considering the widespread misunderstanding that any song in the first-person <i>has</i> to be autobiographical—his private life is a matter of public record these days, and surely he’s grown tired of having to clarify that wasn’t <i>him</i> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvnw-8wmT8M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">eating Thanksgiving dinner in a suburban Denver Catholic church</a> after dad bounced or treating <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADa7n1fM12g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that girl from Silver Lake like complete shit</a>. But even when Gibbard was clearly writing in character, the sketches were<i> personalized,</i> and therein lay the genius of his work—he had an uncanny ability to see things as others might, penning deeply felt and detailed lyrics, willing to risk certain sentiments and awkward phrasings to reward the listener with a richer, more complex and relatable experience.

<p>But Gibbard's change in approach hasn't coincided with a change of subject; <span class=""il"">Death</span> <span class=""il"">Cab</span> for Cutie has not developed a political conscience, nor is Gibbard suddenly experimenting with tone poems.

It’s startling, almost amusing, to hear a hackneyed line like that cutting against the stonefaced sobriety of his delivery and plangent reverbed guitars—every pejorative stereotype of <span class=""il"">Death</span> <span class=""il"">Cab </span>becomes true for four minutes.  </p>
<p>And yet Gibbard also indulges some explicit nostalgia for older Death Cab—during the climactic kiss in the baggage claim, the song reveals itself as basically fan-fic to the video for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmsEAWQwHY4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Movie Script Ending""</a>. This spark of recognition happens far too often on <i>Kintsugi</i>, resulting in songs that just sound like an impersonal reading of better ones from the past. Solo acoustic centerpiece ""Hold No Guns"" wants badly to be <i>Kintsugi</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDHY1D0tKRA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Will Follow You Into the Dark""</a>, but the narrator pleads harmlessness rather than ""til <span class=""il"">death</span> do us part and then some"" devotion. ""Binary Sea"" makes a blatant metaphorical callback to the planetary myth-making of  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3b6hDCIeDk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Transatlanticism"" </a><i>and</i> a number of previous weepy closers (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xctfikAsxmE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stable Song""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vYNyBmn6LE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Lack of Color""</a>). The lightly chiding tone and basic structure of  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEZk9A67f-E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Your Heart Is an Empty Room""</a> is reprised for ""Everything’s a Ceiling""—little of <i>Kintsugi</i> gives the impression that Gibbard’s motivation to reboot <span class=""il"">Death</span> <span class=""il"">Cab</span> is matched by legitimate inspiration.</p>
<p>The newly luxurious production sets Costey up as a convenient scapegoat; ""Everything’s a Ceiling"" and ""Good Help (Is So Hard to Find)"" are the newest sounds here, and they recall the pop-funk Silly Putty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30622-the-1975"" target=""_blank"">the 1975</a> or the Neighbourhood, both of whom are currently competing with <span class=""il"">Death</span> <span class=""il"">Cab</span> for KROQ spins. Otherwise, <i>Kintsug</i><i>i</i> sounds not altogether different than <i>Plans</i>, with Costey's chromed-out glossiness subbed in for Walla's fragile glassiness. Costey keeps Gibbard’s voice as high as possible in the mix, just as Walla would have; the sole exception is the distorted cloak on late-album highlight ""Ingenue"", which is the one track that makes good on <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1785656/working-with-the-scars-death-cab-for-cutie-repair-themselves-for-kintsugi/franchises/cover-story/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""il"">Death</span> <span class=""il"">Cab</span>’s hope to integrate electronic influences</a> like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27655-jon-hopkins"" target=""_blank"">Jon Hopkins</a> without just sounding like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a>. In the context of the full album, this just feels like their latest well-meaning, but ultimately empty promise of a cred infusion (see also: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can"" target=""_blank"">Can</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Kintsugi"" actually refers to a Japanese style of art where broken ceramics are fused together with gold, an apt metaphor but a weirdly honest one. And yet, when <i>Kintsugi</i> gets broken into individual pieces, there are heirlooms worth treasuring. Advance singles ""No Room in Frame"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58773-death-cab-for-cutie-share-the-ghosts-of-beverly-drive/"" target=""_blank"">""The Ghosts of Beverly Drive""</a> are where Gibbard remembers to write great <span class=""il"">Death</span> <span class=""il"">Cab</span> for Cutie songs the way he knows how—zooming on important specifics that speak on a larger idea, trying to make sense of newly formed concepts as he’s explaining them to someone else, rather than starting with the most broad, market-tested metaphors. Maybe it’s <i>not</i> Gibbard driving down I-5 through Fresno Valley, maybe it’s <i>not</i> him doomed to live with regrets in a city <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whgQ_HDnfXw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he still harbors resentments towards</a>. It <i>probably</i> is, but at least Gibbard is willing to share some of himself while leaving plenty to the imagination. It also helps that these songs deliver <span class=""il"">Death</span> <span class=""il"">Cab</span>’s proprietary chorus melodies, winding, thrilling and sunlit like the Pacific Coast Highway of which Gibbard sings so fondly.</p>
<p>But I get it: <span class=""il"">Death</span> <span class=""il"">Cab</span> for Cutie have gone platinum, they’ve hit #1 on Billboard, they’ve been nominated for a Grammy <a href=""http://www.grammy.com/videos/47th-annual-grammy-awards-best-pop-performance-by-a-duo-or-group-with-vocal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and lost to ""My Humps""</a>, they’ve played the former NBA arena in the city where they started and now they’ll play the Hollywood Bowl in Gibbard’s new home. If he’s straining to go against his instincts by writing self-explanatory songs like ""Good Help (Is So Hard to Find)"" and ""You’ve Haunted Me All My Life"" with equally pat arrangements and melodies, well, he’s got cheap seats to reach now. But after 12 years of hearing him repeat ""I need you so much closer"" ad infinitum, that line never hurt more than it does now.</p>

Since his 2011 alliance with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a>’ Maybach Music, the D.C. rapper has found success but has never seemed comfortable with it. And the critical failure of his last album, 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18215-wale-the-gifted/""><i>The Gifted</i></a>, must have shaken him to his core, because at first blush, his latest effort, <i>The Album About Nothing</i>, screams ""return-to-form."" Its title nods to his 2008 ""Seinfeld""-referencing breakout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11963-the-mixtape-about-nothing/""><i>The Mixtape About Nothing</i></a>, a freebie hosted by <a href=""http://foolsgoldrecs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fool’s Gold</a> impresario <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7639-nick-catchdubs/"">Nick Catchdubs</a>. This was around the time when the first wave of ""weirdo"" nerd guys like himself, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27563-charles-hamilton/"">Charles Hamilton</a>, a pre-pop <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27692-bob/"">B.o.B</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/"">Kid Cudi</a> were springing forward—emotional, obsessed with melody, ambitious, accessible. Wale promptly eschewed that sensibility for guest verses on songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"">Waka Flocka Flame</a>’s strip club paean <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skhxizRYxps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No Hands""</a> and Ross’ my-cum-tastes-good commercial <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb6HZa151s8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Diced Pineapples""</a>. Through it all, he struggled to exude palpable confidence. So what does it mean that after all of this push-and-pull, his fourth studio album finds him gazing back towards his origins?</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>The Album About Nothing</i> begins by holding a mirror to Wale’s past, which reflects some of the trappings of his more-famous present. The intro is informed by go-go, D.C.’s signature reworking of funk, and a sound he used frequently early in his career. And once again, the voice of Jerry Seinfeld acts as commentary, stitching the tracks together thematically.  But Wale doesn’t have to rely on audio clips from ""Seinfeld"" anymore: He has Jerry, himself (the two are friends, and Jerry even name-dropped him as one of his ""top five"" in </span><i><a href=""http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/09/tiff-top-five-chris-rock-review"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Top Five</a></i><span>) providing the sound bites. On ""The Helium Balloon"", one of the more interesting songs on the album, he laments his reception as an artist, adding ""Still know what my core needs/ So fuck who ignores me."" What follows isn’t so much the diligent fan service all this promises, though, so much as a muddied collage of attempts at current trends and a lot of sour disaffection. In other words: a Wale album.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Wale clearly remains frustrated with his inability to ascend to the top tier, and on <i>Nothing</i> he presents himself as a rap-industry antagonist. He burrows into the background of ""The Middle Finger"", revealing his discomfort around other rappers and making a hook out of ""Fuck you, leave me alone."" On ""The Glass Egg"", he opts for cleverness over anger, upending <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THtqUDitQ4I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Groove Theory’s ""Tell Me""</a> and flipping its lyrics (""I’ve been doing my own thing""; ""Tell me if you are for real"") from their original incredulous-about-a-crush context into the cry of an outsider. It works so well that it’s almost surprising no one has done it before.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Nothing</i> is a long album, with one cut coming in over the six-minute mark, and when it is sludgy, it is exhausting. The most unfortunate moment is ""The One Time in Houston"", an amateurish attempt at the city’s signature syrupy screw sound. ""The Girls on Drugs"" cleverly samples Janet Jackson’s house party celebration <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=33&amp;v=ApsK6qTaIZ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Go Deep""</a>, but isn’t packed with enough of Wale’s dour thoughts to sound like he’s doing anything more than cribbing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20271-if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late/""><i>If You’re Reading This, It’s Too Late</i></a> flow. For someone who spends so much time decrying other rappers’ lifestyles, it’s a wonder why he is pantomiming at all.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Interpolation is one of the constants of <i>Nothing</i>. ""Balloon"" concludes with a pseudo-dancehall coda loosely riffing on Ini Komoze’s crossover ""Here Comes the Hotstepper"". ""The Success"" borrows from the Eurythmics’ ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"". ""The Body"" fully rips ""You Remind Me of Something"" by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"">R. Kelly</a>, who might not be the best guy to pay homage to in 2015, but when you have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a>, an heir to the Chicago R&amp;B throne, on the hook, it’s a little easier to take. ""The Body"" is the last of five romantic songs on the album, most of which fail to captivate: Only on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a> collaboration ""The Matrimony"", and on the tender ""The Bloom (AG3)"", where he reminds us how good he sounds rapping over a live band, does he sound alive.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-db58bdd9-7644-0ed5-72ae-ed37ee172e4b"">Wale remains intent on dismantling the public’s sour perception of him, but he doesn’t seem to know how. He wants us to know he’s ""Lil Wayne meets Wayne Perry/ Bad Brains from the go-go"" (""The God Smile"") but he’s loaded his album with the opposite: There are no lyrical acrobatics à la Weezy in his prime, and his reference to Wayne Perry is a head-scratcher because Wale has never purported to be a gangster. He waxes political on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"">J. Cole</a>-featuring ""The Pessimist"" about the negative perceptions of black America, through the lens of police brutality or ""Love &amp; Hip-Hop"", but is missing the punk fervor of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/275-bad-brains/"">Bad Brains</a> he namechecks. While there are clear themes throughout the record (love, black experience, a rapper’s malaise), <i>The Album About Nothing</i> is mostly about fear. Fear of becoming an outsider projecting a false hatred of the inside, fear of pushing musical boundaries to nurture one’s own creativity, fear of being vulnerable and, thusly, denying his listeners access to himself. If Wale could only shatter those walls and deliver an album where he no longer sounds like a caricature of himself—it’s no wonder he loves ""Seinfeld""—he might finally get back the amnesty he has been so desperately grasping at for the past five years. All he has now is <i>Nothing </i>to lose.</span></p></div>"|20425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20425-the-album-about-nothing/|5.4|Claire Lobenfeld

The misunderstandings may have stemmed from his association with Auto-Tune, a program misunderstood by nearly everyone. Some complained and covered their ears, while helpful rockists pointed out that Peter Frampton had a talking guitar in the '70s. Everyone else—almost literally <i>everyone</i> else, at least on the radio—began sounding like him. Through it all T-Pain remained steadfast—a guy who was singing and rapping before marrying the two was something you had to do to be relevant, and whose primary instrument made him a target. But far from being a doormat, he <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yfISlGLNU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">made the best joke about himself</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27233-the-lonely-island/"">the Lonely Island</a>, and then made devastating observation that the ""mockery"" of his type of music was nominated for a Grammy, but not his actual music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And then there was ""D.O.A."" And then there was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"">The-Dream</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a>, and most importantly, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> and a new wave of Atlanta rap.

There was Tiny Desk T-Pain, aka, <a href=""http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/t-pain-lifelong-struggle-respect-stoicville-nappy-boy-review/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""oh he can really sing!""</a> T-Pain, which despite pandering to the lowest form of pop authenticity-baiting, accomplished the feat of momentarily reminding us: Hey, this is a real human, and this human can sing. It was endearing and impressive. There was <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-sadness-of-t-pain"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sad T-Pain</a>, regaling us with truly heartbreaking stories about his taking all his negative press and industry guff to heart. Finally, there is new T-Pain. T-Pain is back!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For a guy with this career trajectory, the results on </span><i>The Iron Way</i><span>, his first slab of new music in a little over two years, are unsurprising. He remains somewhat anonymous in spite of his sound’s ubiquity, and his mixtape is essentially straight down the middle half-killer, half-filler. Where all the weirder, more free-thinking Auto-Tune visionaries in his wake took the sound and spun it into</span><span> new directions, T-Pain is content to still warble T-Pain songs. The best ones are cavernous slaps about drinking, strip clubs, and heartbreak, and the second best ones are the more upbeat and sprightly slaps about drinking, strip clubs, and heartbreak.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Which is to say: T-Pain is not, and has never really been, a person I want to hear rap. The weakest songs on </span><i>The Iron Way</i><span> push that rapping to the forefront, to often-awkward and clumsy results. This includes all the songs with features from Young Cash, Sean Jay, Bun B and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"">Big K.R.I.T.</a>, Yo Gotti and Snootie Wild, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32756-og-maco/"">OG Maco</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a> and K Camp. There is a song called ""The King"", and it features Bun B and Big K.R.I.T.: Don’t you already know exactly how it sounds?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The best songs on </span><i>The Iron Way</i><span><i> </i>are the ones that establish an appropriate vibe for the subject matter. The sunny weed ode ""Need to Be Smokin"", the straight up power romance ballad ""Heartbeat"". T-Pain soars on ""Let Ya Hair Down"", a seductive track featuring The-Dream, a long-overdue collaboration that is the perfect union between two guys with great voices who love to twist and turn those voices into new shapes. And usually they sing about sex: On ""</span><span>Booty Butt Ass"",  T-Pain manages to quote ""Oh my God Becky"" in a chorus that doesn’t feel corny, and then in the outro, he morphs the mood of the song from ""strip club turn up"" to ""crying in the champagne room.""</span><span> It’s a mesmerizing two minutes, partly because it’s the most outre moment on a pretty straightforward tape. If everyone else is getting emotional in the club, why not the guy who arguably started the trend over a decade ago?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-f60496a5-76ac-c735-f2b2-da5c9e3e4d00"">This isn’t to paint T-Pain into a corner, just to say that maybe the reason he's battled anonymity over his long career is because he gave us everything we needed on ""I’m Sprung"" (and two years later, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBrRBZy8OTs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Buy U A Drank""</a>). Other guys took his ""thing"" and made it weirder or sexier or more avant garde. But he’s been content, behind a sheepish smile and many features over the years, to continue to do his thing. The world is currently run by dudes Auto-Tuning their emotions into weird new places. T-Pain did it first. And when he’s playing to his strengths, he’s arguably doing it better than anyone else.</span></p></div>"|20438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20438-the-iron-way/|6.1|Matthew Ramirez

But being the straight man in a band like Monotonix still makes you the wildest guy in most any other room, and Gat's post-Monotonix music is clearly the product of a frenzied, restless spirit. <i>Director, </i>the second record from Gat's eponymous trio, was recorded over three marathon 12-hour sessions with engineer Chris Woodhouse, best known for his work with one-take wonders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a>. A series of freewheeling jams were eventually whittled down to a lean 29 minutes and change, then mingled with field recordings the well-traveled Gat collected over the years. The results are all over the place in every sense of the phrase, a frequently dazzling display of the trio's impressively far-flung influences.</p>
<p>To listen to <i>Director</i> is to feel yourself barreling forward; riffs don't so much unfurl as fly by and songs seem to vanish almost as soon as they appear. <i>Director</i>'s constant motion makes it a particularly tough record to pin down for more than a few seconds at a time; in less than half an hour, Gat and company touch on everything from bossa nova to soukous, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>-style jazz-rock to the head-swimming spazz-outs of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5037-ponytail/"">Ponytail</a>. <i>Director</i> is conversant not just in many styles, but many languages; centerpiece ""North to South"", for instance, features lyrics in Hebrew, Portuguese, and English. The Israeli-born Gat and Gal Lazer and the Brazilian Sergio Sayeg bring a remarkably vast number of styles to the table here, gleefully recombining them as they go. And you need not know how to suss out a Phyrgian scale or tell your son from your samba to dig into <i>Director</i>; this is a world party, respectful of tradition but unafraid to throw everything in a blender and gulp.</p>
<p>Gat has technical prowess to spare, but he's less concerned about getting things exactly right; there's a seat-of-their-pants feel to the whole of <i>Director</i>, the occasional near-flub a product of their refusal to slow down for any length of time. While Sayeg stays deep in the pocket, Lazer's drums—with cues from Gene Krupa, John Bonham and Tony Allen—and Gat's guitar either tussle like dogs and crackle like flint. Vocals, used sparingly, are often sunk low in the mix. This, combined with Gat's conversational field recordings, gives <i>Director</i> the feel of driving past a bustling street scene with the windows down; you can feel the radiance in the air, even if you're moving just a little too quickly to quite put your finger on it. Despite its sitcom-length runtime, <i>Director</i> manages to feel maybe 10 minutes shorter, so rarely does it pause to fully soak in the scenery.</p>
<p>For all its energy, <i>Director</i> ends not with a bang, but with a floorward collapse. The brief, diffuse ""Underwater Prelude"" seems designed to provide a respite from the calamity that precedes it, but it only ends up sapping the built-up momentum. The skronky ""L'Atlantis"" sounds like the intro to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> song that never fully gets itself off the ground. And closer ""Tanto Que Nem Tem"", with a lovely, mournful vocal turn from Sayeg, is punctuated by bursts of noise that distract where they're meant to disorient. Still, the wildness of the ride <i>Director</i> takes you on more than makes up for this rocky landing. </p></div>"|20372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20372-director/|7.0|Paul Thompson

Black Emperor returned to record after a long hiatus with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17283-allelujah-dont-bend-ascend/""><i>Allelujah! Don’t Bend! Ascend!</i></a> they weren’t quite releasing new music.<i> </i>The album consisted of pieces the Montreal collective had composed during the early 2000s, back when they were at their most prolific, and the album was simply a matter of getting long-performed work down in the studio. <i>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</i> contains music of a more recent vintage, which is potentially significant because following Godspeed has always meant grappling with a basic question: When you have one of the most distinctive sonic profiles in music—that trademark quiet/loud mix of soaring guitars, epic strings, and field recordings—how important is it to branch out beyond it? Do we want a Godspeed album that sounds like anything but Godspeed?</p>
<p><i>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</i>, conceived a decade after their initial run, when they defined everything this band is and should be, does not offer a new wrinkle. There is nothing about this album—from the particulars of the recording to the riffs to the arrangements—that would have sounded out of place if they had released it in 2002. Change is not Godspeed’s way, but the other side of that coin is that, despite many imitators, there’s also nothing else out there that sounds quite like them. The shifts on this record involve pivots more than actual movement: At points, guitars are unusually prominent and the music feels a bit heavier. It’s also their shortest album. But beyond a few such tweaks, the album is Godspeed to its core, moving from thin drones to Wagnerian pomp and circumstance and back again over long, patient stretches.</p>
<p>As much as any record they’ve made, the music here is meant to work as one, and sequencing and flow is everything. They’ve been working out this material live for some time now, and fans have taken to calling the whole ""Behemoth"", an appropriate descriptor given its heaviness. Though there are four tracks, the album really happens in three movements. The first and third contain the slowly building refrains and crashing climaxes, and the middle two tracks are more of a single 16-minute piece consisting of drones, gushes of guitar feedback, and fragments of strings. On the vinyl version of the album, the A-side cleverly ends with a locked groove to suggest a sense of continuity, but the CD version finds the two middle pieces flowing one into the next.</p>
<p>Sandwiching the drone section between the two crashing fanfares makes good sense, allowing the album to breathe and suggesting more variety than it might otherwise. Opening track ""Peasantry or ‘Light! Inside of Light!’"" is the album’s highlight, and ranks with Godspeed’s best work. The guitar riff has serious weight and crunch to it, and the piece unfolds with a modal sweep. But the transformation the main line gradually undergoes, where a dramatically beautiful desert vista becomes a setting for a melody that suggests a drunken holiday singalong, shows that there’s still a lot they can do with their basic ingredients.</p>
<p>""Peasantry"" and the closing ""Piss Crowns Are Trebled"" are so intense and grandiose they skirt self-parody, always a risk with this band. But it's possible to give Godspeed the benefit of the doubt, in part because of how they’ve conducted themselves throughout their career. In 2015, music like this is usually used to sell things, whether it’s a product or<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOPgwZ9hj00"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a television show</a>. There’s <i>so much feeling</i> in it, huge washes of sound that could easily be regarded as manipulative, and capitalism inevitably strives to pair these kinds of sounds with product. As a listener, to give yourself over to this kind of soaring music, allowing yourself to be carried away, implies a certain amount of trust. Godspeed You! Black Emperor record and play instrumental pieces that exist to move you, using only the force of music, and in a space where sound is the primary context. It's a different kind of transaction. You have to let your guard down, and Godspeed have to transform feelings into compelling records. They're still on track.</p></div>"|20334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20334-asunder-sweet-and-other-distress/|7.6|Mark Richardson

In the case of Jodeci, the news was more encouraging: more than just a nostalgia act, the groundbreaking '90s R&amp;B group were one of the original purveyors of male ratchet. There would be no Chris Brown or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31498-partynextdoor/"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a> if DeVante Swing, K-Ci, JoJo and Mr. Dalvin hadn’t stomped and writhed all over R&amp;B, opening up a new, sex-positive lane for male rappers and singers. Until Jodeci unlocked the swag, R&amp;B singers were often blazer-and-sweater wearing singers, rarely approaching the energy and aesthetic of a rapper. (The foursome was truly a marquee act on this front—check out this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2DZfyVUkeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">safe sex PSA from 1995</a>.) Twenty years on from their third album <i>The Show, the After Party, the Hotel</i>, Jodeci’s returned to a hip-hop and R&amp;B landscape that’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krlxHu6pAA0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more sexually liberated than ever before</a>. So, what’s on the agenda for <i>The Past, the Present, the Future</i>?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In some ways, the 'Bad Boys of R&amp;B' tagline was just a foil: Jodeci, led by producer/singer DeVante Swing, remains a group of soul classicists, thematically inspired by the intimacy and lewdness of sex and buttressed by the aesthetic and energy of hip-hop. So, like the second single ""Every Moment"" hinted, this is another record of silky, pro-forma bedroom soul; a classic, if slightly tame Jodeci record, with no real aesthetic challenges or age-inappropriate shifts in style. It’s a fans-first album that certainly won’t be played outside of urban radio formats—but then, it's rare to hear anything as assuredly black as Jodeci’s pristine, four-part harmonies and celestial new jack swing outside those formats anymore anyway.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Those Things"", one of <i>The Past</i>’s best tracks, begins in that classic territory before rapid-fire kick drums and snares and a warped synth offer a genius update: New jack swing for a post-trap world, courtesy of former protégé <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a>, who produces the track as well as ""Incredible"". A wave of sweet <i>oohs</i> breezes through ""Stress Reliever"", paired with thick drums that give the track the airy whimsy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12181-jai-paul-btstu-edit/"">Jai Paul’s ""BTSTU""</a>. Most of the remaining 11 tracks are closer to ""Too Hot"", which lifts the thunderous bass line from Dawn Penn’s classic, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_LKYyXFFrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Don't Love Me (No, No, No""</a>. It’s all ingenious, brawny R&amp;B that celebrates the past, but there’s not much on this album of midtempo ballads that presents a vision of the future. The few guest starts here don't upset the balance: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27692-bob/"">B.o.B</a> (""Nobody Wins"") and Mila J (""Body Parts""), deliver lukewarm verses and are outperformed by the bombast of the group vocals. Despite the evidence ""Those Things"" puts forward, Jodeci is clearly comfortable living amidst the vaulted synths of their prime, and that doesn’t have to be a bad thing.</p>
<p>In truth, they display a confidence in declining to chase or win over new fans that is exceedingly rare in legacy acts. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy</a>’s retreading her own trailblazing route by glomming onto <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7717-mary-j-blige/"">Mary J. Blige</a> had to go to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a> to get some play. Jodeci are no longer music’s go-to bad boys.

The album contains elements of his prior work under the name—particularly its general tone of melancholy and disrepair—but he chooses to zone in on the drifty and (mostly) instrumental side of his music for this album. It’s a subtle shift but not an insignificant one—he sounds more confident and in control than on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17670-benoit-pioulard-hymnal/""><i>Hymnal</i></a>, which veered closer to a grab-bag aesthetic. As is often the case when artists reinvent what they’re doing, Meluch had to go backward to move forward, forgoing digital tools to work in an analog environment. The results are more otherworldly, with tiny drones and banks of noise and blocks of tape hiss all coiling around one another, locked tight in an uneasy embrace that only Meluch can connect or disconnect.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What </span><i>Sonnet</i><span> gains over other albums Meluch has made is a more acute sense of direction. The tone varies in shades throughout, sounding like a lost radio broadcast fighting through static, or music humming quietly out of a dysfunctional intercom in a broken down hospital. At some points it reaches such a level of atrophy that it feels like the instruments are disintegrating in Meluch's hands as he records with them. It’s an album that will get slotted into the ambient category, but it’s not ambient in the sense of being something to relax to or to have on in the background. It’s more arresting than that, as ideas crystallize in short, ever-repeating loops.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Meluch's method here is to take field recordings of industrial equipment and nature and attempt to replicate them on guitar. But <i>Sonnet</i> isn’t an album that benefits from being broken down into parts—it’s best consumed whole, in a single sitting, where Meluch’s sense of exploration can truly unfold. At times, he’s knee-deep in sludge, making tar-like guitar lines sound like something you wade through. At others, he’s up in the stratosphere, channeling the mesh between krautrock and shoegaze that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1524-flying-saucer-attack/"">Flying Saucer Attack</a> were practicing circa <i>Further</i>.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-61a1ee80-5ca3-a601-5ae1-5b29747a9ede"">Vocals come rarely on <i>Sonnet</i>—Meluch removed most of them while paring down the album to its core emotions. When they do appear, they're just another element ghosting into the murk. The result is often reminiscent of the space <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28582-leyland-kirby/"">Leyland Kirby</a> works in when he records as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"">the Caretaker</a>, all haunted mirrors and nearly forgotten memories, constructed at the very point where those things feel like they’re about to permanently slip into oblivion. <i>Sonnet</i> positions Meluch somewhere beyond the insular place he occupied before. </span></p></div>"|20304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20304-sonnet/|7.2|Nick Neyland

That those points needed making says plenty about the Edmonton songwriter, who’s since refined her '60s-styled indie-pop under the Faith Healer alias. Jalbert, who seems both assured and self-scrutinizing, sidelines in the kind of record-collecting, plainclothes punk bands who covet the Troggs over the Pistols, which frees up her solo work to dive into her daydreamy subconscious. On </span><i>Cosmic Troubles</i><span>, her second solo album, she shares private epiphanies and stares at her bedroom ceiling as the universe unravels.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Recorded with longtime collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31031-renny-wilson/"">Renny Wilson</a> in his parents’ makeshift basement studio, <i>Cosmic Troubles</i> sounds every bit as excitable and debut-fresh as <i>Brother Loyola</i>. It meanders calmly from in thrall to enthralling, and enjoys the trip—by the chorus of ""Canonized"", Jalbert and Wilson are playfully excavating <i>White Album</i>-era Beatles via the shambling exuberance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3517-the-raincoats/"">the Raincoats</a>, and it sounds fantastic. If there’s little impetus to write great songs that don’t sound like other great songs—usually, it transpires, songs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>—the references rarely grate; it’s a record that keeps its influences close, like childhood toys under the bed, in a way that’s reassuring rather than cumbersome.</p>
<p class=""p2"">For much of the album Jalbert sings in a calmly vacated tone. Her demeanor is neither ingenuous nor jaded, and she has the dreamy air of somebody who’d spend therapy sessions psychoanalyzing her shrink. Despite the record’s rigorous self-analysis, Jalbert owns her self-consciousness, and applies it on her own terms. Sometimes it becomes a principle ingredient. ""Fools Rush In"" embodies the narrator’s hypercritical subconscious in a taunting Beach Boys harmony: ""I'm so stupid, ba-ba-ba."" ""Again"" taps into the goldmine of whimsy that links neuroses and laundry—""It’s a pain to stretch yourself out after being through the wash""—while ""Angel Eyes"", conventional but no less enchanting, opens its heart with the unrelenting steadiness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a>. For all its stylistic play, the record’s tenor is uniformly self-certain.</p>
<p class=""p2"">So it’s all the more alarming when it cracks. The title track, for one, is musically on-point, with haunting echoes of Jefferson Airplane. But its words depict a domestic dispute in stark terms: ""I was out of my mind with my hands around my neck/ You raised yours to slap them off, and I raised mine out to protect."" After the heavenly ""Infinite Return"", ""No Car"" kicks up a heavy riff, before describing a recent breakup from which the partner’s fingers are ""bruised into my flesh.""</p>
<p class=""p2"">In these fragments Jalbert’s songwriting seems to crystallise, her gentle dredging a way to send you fathoms deep into her mind without having to follow all the way. At times it sounds like, having grown out of nihilism, Jalbert is reaching for the nearest tune to get lost in, her stories a psychic sojourn on the route home to oblivion. By the time you return to ""Fools Rush In"", where she slides from lackadaisical soul-searching into idle contemplations of suicide-by-drowning, <i>Cosmic Troubles</i> sounds a sadder, vaster album than before, but one whose meditations can soothe your bones like an inviting stream.</p></div>"|20371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20371-cosmic-troubles/|7.4|Jazz Monroe

The demon takes human form; it can’t be seen by anyone but the cursed, and those who’ve previously borne the curse. (It only targets one person at a time.) It doesn’t run—it walks, stopping only when it’s in range for a vicious attack that leaves the victim’s limbs snapped, and their pelvises crushed by coital rage. It can’t open doors, but it knows how to knock. It’s the dark presence behind one of the more gripping horror movies of recent memory, as well as a fantastic argument for abstinence.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The soundtrack is handled by Disasterpeace, aka Rich Vreeland, an electronic artist who’s best known for a series of video game soundtracks. </span><i>It Follows</i><span> is his first film score, and he’s worked diligently to build a cohesive world of ominous moods. There are several recurring motifs: a booming percussion that comes like the monster pounding on the door; a shrill klaxon signaling when danger is near; a pattern of corrupted synths chugging into motion like some futuristic train on its way to the junkyard. A window shatters. A cluster of digital hornets buzz and whine. A jet turbine spins into motion, the air supercharging to an agonizing din, only to die down and leave the room sapped of tension. It’s a score that announces when something is about to happen, only to suddenly upend expectations and leave the room on edge.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>It Follows </i>wouldn’t exist without <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a>’s movies, and neither would the score. ""Title"" sounds like an update of Carpenter’s <i>Halloween </i>theme, as a lonely piano line is slowly enveloped by gothic dread. The melody is echoed on ""Detroit"", the arpeggiated tones brushing up against the sublime as the synthesizers drone from underneath. This is where you’d maybe dock Vreeland and the filmmakers a point for originality, except <i>It Follows </i>comes at a precarious moment for the American horror movie. Everything is either point-of-view or torture porn, and frankly, if someone wants mine a source as fertile as <i>Halloween</i>, they should go right ahead.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Like all OSTs, <i>It Follows</i> makes the most sense when you’ve seen the movie it’s made for—and you <i>should</i> see it, especially if you can watch horror movies in genuine terror of what’s about to happen. But it can work in other contexts, and a quick scan of Vreeland’s work shows he isn’t a one-trick composer leaning on his Casio. I’m most familiar with his score for </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez_%28video_game%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fez""</a><span>, a video game that’s ""Super Mario"" meets M.C. Escher, in which a pixellated alien explores a slowly decaying cartoon world. </span>""Fez"" <span>is a playful, adventurous game in which a sense of whimsy is frequently juxtaposed with the solitude of the unknown. Vreeland’s score conveyed those moods, just as his work for </span><i>It Follows</i><span> captures the paranoid fervor aroused by finding your normally comfortable surroundings transformed into a danger zone. Is it your friend you’re looking at, or the monster? How about now?</span></p></div>"|20427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20427-it-follows-ost/|7.3|Jeremy Gordon

Cryptic break-up notes, a tumultuous split with <a href=""http://www.epicrecords.com/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Epic</a>, a realignment with <a href=""http://www.harvestrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harvest</a>, cancelled tours (including one with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a>), no-show gigs: All of these antics were tolerable, sometimes fun, when they came backed up by compelling music. But even that part of the bargain, over the last year, has proved questionable. Last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19472-death-grips-niggas-on-the-moon/""><i>Niggas on the Moon</i></a> leaned too heavily on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> samples and flattened their approach, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20102-fashion-week/""><i>Fashion Week</i></a> was an intriguing, if ultimately directionless, collection of instrumentals. <i>Fashion'</i>s song titles spelled out<i> JENNYDEATHWHEN, </i>hinting cryptically that their next album would be <i>Jenny Death</i>, the second half of the two-part sequence called <i>The Powers That B. </i>But by <i>Fashion</i>, it was hard to tell if even their hardcore faithful cared about what they would do next. </p>
<p><i>Jenny</i>, which Death Grips streamed on YouTube last week in advance of its release,<i> </i>is the record they needed to make. It’s not on the level of their artistic and commercial breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16512-death-grips-the-money-store/""><i>The Money Store</i></a>, but it will absolutely remind you of why you loved them in the first place. In fact, it’s so different from (and better than) <i>Moon</i> that it shouldn’t even be tethered to it. On these ten tracks, they’ve harnessed the unbridled energy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18779-death-grips-government-plates/""><i>Government Plates</i></a> into their most fully formed songs since <i>Money</i>, which helps justify their bluster.</p>
<p>Producer Andy ""Flatlander"" Morin brings a lot of the death-disco of <i>Money </i>back into the mix, which broadens their approach without compromising their potency. Nothing here reaches the aggro-pop heights of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13421-ive-seen-footage/"">""I’ve Seen Footage""</a>, but ""Inanimate Sensation"" comes close; it's clear why it was released as the first single. Over Flatlander’s seasick bass synths, Stefan ""MC Ride"" Burnett jumps through various vocals patterns—his trademark bark, chopped-and-screwed raps, menacing whispers—and ends up with something like a Jock Jams for the underworld. The buildup to MC Ride’s final verse is a staticky, topsy-turvy rush, culminating with the soon-to-be-immortal ""I like my iPod more than fucking!"" Yell that with your headphones on at work. </p>
<p>MC Ride was so sorely missed on <i>Fashion</i> that his presence on <i>Jenny</i> feels like a triumphant comeback. Flatlander may provide the electronics and Hill may bring the percussive energy (and also lent initial critical credibility) to Death Grips, but MC Ride is the unpredictable heart of the group. He was somewhat lost in the madness of <i>Plates</i> and subdued on <i>Moon, </i>but he is in full, raw force here:<i> </i>The title ""I Break Mirrors With My Face in the United States"" brings to mind a sadistic animated .gif enacting the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"">Black Flag</a> <i>Damaged</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/damaged.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a>, and MC Ride's raging, hypnotic vocal reinforces this impression. He isn’t just a spiral of rage, either—""Pss Pss"" casts him in creep mode, suggesting illicit fantasies in a hushed whisper.</p>
<p>The music on <i>Jenny</i> nods to Death Grips' more conventional rock influences, but it’s in no way trying to pander to a rock audience. Each element they reference is blown up and rebuilt in their own vision. Vaguely surfy dream-pop gets shot into overdrive on ""Centuries of Damn"". ""Beyond Alive"" and ""ON GP"" both contain big rock riffs, the latter approaching metalgaze territory. ""GP"" inflates MC Ride’s discontentment into something massive and anthemic. It’s jaded stadium rock—all it needs is a stadium and an ironclad guarantee they’ll show up.</p>
<p>You hear more of drummer Zach Hill’s acoustic drums on <i>Jenny</i>, too. He continues to unlearn his technical prowess from his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2003-hella/"">Hella</a> days, but he’s electrifying even when going back to basics. Throughout, you can hear them furthering their vision for aggression without borders, swallowing in hip-hop, hardcore, industrial, and the hardest forms of dance music, while not in debt to any one of those elements. Death Grips don’t just imagine a world where rap-rock is redeemed and various forms of heaviness coexist side-by-side, but where those lines are obliterated. That fantasy may not have panned out quite the way it should have, but to deny their ambitions does a disservice to what heavy music can be.</p>
<p>Closer ""Death Grips 2.0"" acknowledges the ongoing ""will they or won’t they"" dynamic that’s long been a point of frustration amongst their critics. The title suggests a rebirth, but the content, a sort of Araabmetalmuzik blast of cut-up industrial beats, could also be a fiery demise. It’s the perfect Death Grips closer, especially with their status in constant question. Right after their alleged ""breakup,"" there were eulogies for the group, but Death Grips are not the sort of group to be eulogized. Are they calling it quits after this record and tour? Was the breakup even real to begin with? It’s hard to speculate whether <i>Jenny</i> is a redemptive closing chapter, a new beginning, or some other inscrutable part of Death Grips’ master plan, if they even have such a thing. What is evident is that <i>Jenny Death</i> is some of their strongest material in a while, and may even return a few disillusioned converts to the flock.</p></div>"|20451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20451-jenny-death/|8.1|Andy O'Connor

On his 2012 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16381-kingdoms/""><i>Kingdoms</i></a>, Greene delivered a set of workmanlike deep-house all built around carefully manipulated vocal samples. Spread out over the next couple years, Fort Romeau’s ensuing four EPs documented both his continually improving production abilities and his widening palette. Thanks to moments like the <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/169236-Kosmische-Musik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Kosmische</i></a>-influenced slow burn of 2013’s ""Stay/True"" (from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18483-fort-romeau-stay-true-ep/"">EP of the same name</a>) or the stuttery tech-house/2-step of ""SW9"" (also from the EP of the same name), Greene quietly established himself as an intriguing new voice in the genre.</p>
<p><i>Insides</i> is Fort Romeau’s second full-length record, and although it doesn’t continue on quite the same upward trend of his recent discography in the risk-taking department, it does boast some of his most fully dimensional and impressively produced work yet. While there are barely any vocal samples to be found here, it’s adorned with the kinds of textures and details that had been missing from the wide-eyed <i>Kingdoms</i>. Tonally, it’s a darker and more pensive affair, one that’s less concerned with its vocal centerpieces and more interested in atmosphere, craft and classicism.</p>
<p>Some have framed <i>Insides</i> as a modern throwback record, one that owes its sound to Chicago house more than anything else, and indeed, from the first acidic squiggle in opener ""New Wave"", it’s evident that Greene is studiously and consciously showing his work. Having toured and DJed a fair amount in the time since his last full-length, it seems that he’s come back to the studio with knowledge and reverence to burn, and the galloping pianos and wending atmospherics in the 8-minute long ""All I Want"" and the brooding single-note synth warbles and tech-house flavorings of ""Insides"" bear that out.</p>
<p>But merely painting <i>Insides</i> as an homage to Chicago would be to miss the thing that makes it most interesting. Ultimately, it’s Greene’s willingness to decorate house music’s form with new sounds and reference points that distinguishes him from the scads of Beatport randoms. <i>Insides</i> is inflected with tinges of <i>K</i><i>osmische</i>, ambient and microhouse to the extent that some of its best tracks—like the intricate patchwork of bells and percussion of ""Cloche"" or the lonely synth arpeggios of ""IKB""—could barely pass for house at all. Elsewhere, the loping computer music of ""Folle"" and the whirlygigging synth-aided second half of the ten-and-a-half-minute long ""Lately"" recall artists as varied as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>.</p>
<p>That Fort Romeau was rashly named after an adjacent town while Greene was in France tells you something about his attitude to his music. He may occasionally be trumpeted by classicists as a flag-waver for the old school, but there’s no actual agenda here beyond his desire to make interesting new sounds. He's getting better at it with every passing release.</p></div>"|20244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20244-fort-romeau-insides/|7.5|Mark Pytlik

In place of the intense polish of the duo’s most recent album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18295-fuck-buttons-slow-focus/""><i>Slow Focus</i></a>, Hung offers a brief look at the way his mind works when faced with a vastly pared-down set of tools—in this case, a Game Boy. (Though as he has said, that choice was simply a convenient solution to the dearth of portable, easy-to-manipulate gear during Fuck Buttons’ last tour.)<br/> <br/>Writing music on an obsolete gaming tool probably seems hopelessly antiquarian to some (especially if you grew up with the DS) but the uninhibited, high-strung music Hung wrings from it feels fresh. There’s nothing here of the magnitude of their massive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13617-tarot-sport/""><i>Tarot Sport</i></a> centerpiece ""Olympians"", or the protracted leer of <i>Slow Focus</i>. The biggest and brightest moment is the irrepressible glitch-fest ""Korea Town"", a gorgeous tide of bleeps and bloops, with romantically wafting strings laid on thick on top.<br/> <br/>The EP’s other two tracks are harder-edged, built on heavily metronomic beats with just enough swing to stick. They’re also nowhere near as pretty: The propulsive, bull-headed stomp ""The Plane"" is stippled with sharp, abrasive sound effects, pushing the rough equipment to an aggressive extreme. Hung also shows a punkish sense of humor, adding in an almost comically seasick warble partway through ""Fables"". All three songs sound like a loose extension of the unconventional methodology that’s driven Hung and Fuck Buttons bandmate Benjamin John Power’s collaborative jamming.</p>
<div>The EP also benefits from a handmade quality, one that you certainly wouldn’t find on a Fuck Buttons album at this point. Hung and Powers have often worked with cheap equipment, from karaoke machines to children's toys, though they've shown an increasing focus on sound quality as the scale of their work has increased. Here, Hung's unvarnished approach serves to highlight themes that repeatedly creep into his work—an underlying affinity for gear-grinding industrial sounds; a focus on process over a specific end result. In that sense, it's a welcome refresher.</div></div>"|20405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20405-rave-cave-ep/|7.0|Abigail Garnett

With a catalog that deep, it certainly would've been well-earned if the British-born musician decided to undertake the exercise of compiling a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:20th_Century_Masters_albums"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">20th Century Masters</a> collection of his disparate, dusty, and largely under-the-radar recordings. But though the name may suggest otherwise, <i>Deep Hits</i>, his debut release as Tufthunter, is a less self-indulgent affair. Instead, it's a collection of what Momtchiloff does best—guitar-centered pop songs, delightful and charming despite (or maybe because of) their lack of grander ambition. This time around there's an extra spark thanks to a host of guest vocal turns from friends he's accrued over the course of his career.</p>
<p>Even though there's a different voice on each track, Momtchiloff conjures a fairly unified mood. <a href=""http://didnotchart.blogspot.com/2015/03/tufthunter-deep-hits.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In a recent interview</a>, he acknowledged that the revolving-door concept of Tufthunter owes itself to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2742-stephin-merritt"">Stephin Merritt</a>'s project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3812-the-6ths/"">the 6ths</a>. But while those records skipped around the world of indie rock, enlisting luminaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2842-bob-mould/"">Bob Mould</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/586-lou-barlow/"">Lou Barlow</a>, Momtchiloff's guests are mostly confined to the twee world he came up in. Album opener ""Lit Up""'s lyrical focus on partying for ""old times' sake"" is central to the exercise that Momtchiloff is undertaking on <i>Deep Hits</i>. That Lois Maffeo-featuring track, as well as a handful of others, recalls the sunny strumming of his days in Heavenly. But this isn't merely an occasion for the accomplished guitarist to trot out his own familiar lilting lines: He's offering up a twisted and ramshackle take on the whole history of indie pop.</p>
<p>On ""We Fly By Night"" he conjures a compelling vision of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>-indebted krautrock, motoring on the back of a searing organ drone and a couple of brittle and anxious lead lines. He enlists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2643-the-magnetic-fields/"">the Magnetic Fields</a>' Claudia Gonson for wry, orchestral backed storytelling on ""How Venus Got Her Name"" and his former bandmate Amelia Fletcher for stripped down <a href=""http://shop.krecs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">K Records</a> joy on ""My Future Band"". It's a difference of shades, sure, but by capably nodding to a whole host of genre touchstones over the course of the record, he demonstrates range in a style more often known for its charm than its technical ability.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Momtchiloff has resisted the temptation of literally making a compilation of his work, <i>Deep Hits</i> ultimately does something similar anyway, offering the whole spectrum of twee in a tidy 46 minutes, with all the pitfalls that may come with doing so. Even those legendary <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Records_discography#Compilations"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Records comps</a> had their down moments. So it's understandable that when he runs the tracks a little longer, as on ""Low Life"" and ""You're All Going to Die"", the allure of the pastiche tends to wear a little thin. But at its highest points, like Gonson's dead-eyed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_So_Stories"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">just-so story </a>and the self-doubting straightedge anthem ""The Drink and the Drugs"", <i>Deep Hits</i> suggests a promise for Tufthunter that goes beyond just capably looking in the rearview mirror.</p></div>"|20389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20389-deep-hits/|6.9|Colin Joyce

Warner Brothers’ highest grossing film of 1954 was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw5i-PVLMVY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Them!</i></a>,  about a scourge of atomically enhanced ants. Soon, all everyday bugs were distorted to inspire fear and horror, a trend lasting well into the 1970s, where movies gave us reason to fear fire-starting roaches (1975’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0OnDYxdilk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Bug</i></a>), African killer bees (1978’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZamBZEDmKU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Swarm</i></a>) and flesh-eating earthworms (1976’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyTpkR2cwLo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Squirm</i></a>).</p>
<p>One of the most profound—albeit neglected—sci-fi horror films to arise from the insect- kingdom subgenre was 1974’s <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_IV"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phase IV</a>. </i>Like<i> Them!, Phase IV</i> scrutinized ants, but instead of being supersized by radiation, these ants had been intellectually enhanced by a cosmic event<i>. </i>The movie holds a special place in the hearts of cinephiles and graphic designers as the lone film made by Saul Bass, an artist who designed the posters for <i>Spartacus</i> and <i>Anatomy of a Murder,</i> and the title sequences for <i>West Side Story</i>, <i>Vertigo</i>, and <i>Goodfellas, </i>among others. Alas, his lone foray behind the camera was a disaster: <i>Phase IV</i> sank without much attention upon its release, and is probably most famous today for being <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YlYz6Nzq-s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mocked</a> in the very first season of <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i> (and, I suppose,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvUaK_MWkDg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> inspiring a Yeasayer video</a>). Perhaps that’s why its soundtrack has never seen release until now, with <a href=""http://waxwork-records.myshopify.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Waxwork Records</a> paying loving tribute to the film with a special vinyl pressing.</p>
<p>Brian Gascoigne has credits intermittently spanning decades, ranging from <i>The Dark Crystal</i> to <i>Gosford Park</i> to <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, and he’s worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a>. He gets the compositional credit on this soundtrack, though the intense analog synthesizer work is contributed by Desmond Briscoe and David Vorhaus. The soundtrack also features Japanese percussionist Stomu Yamash’ta. While many sci-fi and horror films of the '70s are usually brief cues (rare is the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a> track that runs longer than three minutes) what makes <i>Phase IV</i> such a fascinating listen forty years later is that the compositions are broken down into four exploratory, ever-evolving sections, each in the eight-minute range, spanning a wide spectrum of emotion, from fear to pastoral calm, from alien to earthly.</p>
<p>The drones that open ""Phase I"" might be Ligeti-like vocal choirs or bent circuits, but no matter the source, they make the skin prickle with dread. The sinewaves of Briscoe and Vorhaus soon blossom and Yamash’ta’s rumbling tympanum emerge, only to have it all give way to a walking bassline and some sludgy electronics, which threaten to dissolve the piece until a dirge-like theme returns at the end. Flute and strings emerge on ""Phase II"" and carry through most of ""Phase III"" but the analog synthesizers return midway through the piece and carry most of ""Phase IV"". There are traces of sound that might bring to mind the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31611-bitchin-bajas/"">Bitchin Bajas</a> or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19349-oren-ambarchi-stephen-omalley-randall-dunn-shade-themes-from-kairos/""><i>Shade Themes from Kairos</i></a>, but the sound here is pretty much of its own realm. With <i>Phase IV</i> finally back in print (although still missing the original psychedelic ending that Bass imagined for the film), it’s cosmic justice of a sort that the accompanying music can now take its rightful place among the 70's strange soundtrack pantheon.</p></div>"|20386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20386-phase-iv-ost/|7.4|Andy Beta

This is a big claim, considering his career: 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7510-greetings-from-michigan-the-great-lakes-state/""><i>Michigan</i></a>, 2004's stripped-down <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7512-seven-swans/""><i>Seven Swans</i></a>, 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7514-illinois/""><i>Illinois</i></a>, and 2010's knotty electro-acoustic collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14738-the-age-of-adz/""><i>The Age of Adz</i></a>. He's also had residencies at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, collaborated with rappers and the National, donned wings and paint-splattered dayglo costumes, and released Christmas albums. But none of those side projects were ultimately ever as interesting, or effective, as when Sufjan was just Sufjan, a guy with a guitar or piano, well-detailed lyrics, and a gorgeous whisper that could reach into a heartbreaking falsetto.</p>
<p>Part of what makes <i>Carrie &amp; Lowell</i> so great is that it comes after all of those things—the wings, the orchestras—but it feels like you're hearing him for the first time again, and in his most intimate form. This record is <i></i>a return to the sparse folk of <i>Seven Swans</i>, but with a decade's worth of honing and exploration packed into it. It already feels like his most classic and pure effort.</p>
<p>By now the album's main narrative is well-known. <i>Carrie &amp; Lowell</i> is titled after Stevens' mother and stepfather. Carrie was bipolar and schizophrenic and suffered from drug addiction and substance abuse. She died of stomach cancer in 2012, but had abandoned Stevens much earlier, first when he was 1, then later, repeatedly (""when I was three, three maybe four, she left us at that video store,"" he sings on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17370-sufjan-stevens-should-have-known-better/"">""Should Have Known Better""</a>). His stepfather, Lowell Brams, was married to Carrie for five years when Sufjan was a child. As a testament to the importance of his role in Stevens' life, Brams currently runs Stevens' label, <a href=""http://asthmatickitty.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Asthmatic Kitty</a>, and shows up repeatedly in the record, most poignantly on the title track, where Stevens frames those five years as his ""season of hope.""</p>
<p>Stevens has always written personally, weaving his life story into larger narratives, but here his autobiography, front and center, is itself the grand history. The songs explore childhood, family, grief, depression, loneliness, faith, and rebirth in direct and unflinching language that matches the scaled-back instrumentation. There are Biblical references, and references to mythology, but most of it is squarely about Stevens and his family. A few of the songs (""Carrie &amp; Lowell"", ""Eugene"", ""All of Me Wants All of You"") mention the summer trips to Oregon that Stevens made, between the ages of five and eight, with Carrie, Lowell, and his brother. There are Oregon-specific references to Eugene, the Tillamook Burn forest fires, Spencer Butte, the Lost Blue Bucket Mine, and swimming lessons with a man who calls him Subaru. These were moments when Stevens was closest to his mother, or at least in most constant proximity to her, and he recorded some of <i>Carrie &amp; Lowell</i>'s tracks on an iPhone in a hotel in Klamath Falls, Oregon, as if trying to find a way to recreate those moments one more time.</p>
<p>Other songs focus on an adult Stevens coping with the aftermath of those early years, and the blankness his mother's distance and death left in him. He beats himself up for not trying harder to be closer earlier. On ""Should Have Known Better"" he sings ""I should have wrote a letter/ Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling."" He talks about his own drinking (""Now I'm drunk and afraid/ Wishing the world would go away"") and drug abuse, disconnected relationships (""You checked your text while I masturbated""), self-loathing, and emptiness (""In a manner of speaking I'm dead""). There are suicidal thoughts (arm cutting, driving a car off a cliff, drowning, and questions like ""Do I care if I survive this?""), which he pushes away with his faith and by focusing on the wonders around him (""Sea lion caves in the dark,"" the hysterical light of Eugene, Oregon). There is a lot of blood. Some broken bones. Tears. There is also a constant need to be closer—to his mother, to himself, to the world around him—even when it seems useless: ""What's the point of singing songs/ If they'll never even hear you?"" (""Eugene""). The other main character here is his brother, Marzuki Stevens, and his daughter, Sufjan's niece, who provides the one true moment of joy on the record: ""My brother had a daughter/ The beauty that she brings, illumination"" (""Should Have Known Better"").</p>
<p>As he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9595-true-myth-a-conversation-with-sufjan-stevens/"">told</a> Pitchfork, ""With this record, I needed to extract myself out of this environment of make-believe. It’s something that was necessary for me to do in the wake of my mother’s death—to pursue a sense of peace and serenity in spite of suffering. It’s not really trying to say anything new, or prove anything, or innovate. It feels artless, which is a good thing. This is not my art project; this is my life."" On the second to last track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17333-sufjan-stevens-no-shade-in-the-shadow-of-the-cross/"">""No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross""</a>, he sings, in falsetto, ""Fuck me I'm falling apart,"" and it is maybe the barest, most honest declaration you'll hear on a record this year.<span style=""text-decoration: line-through;""><br/></span></p>
<p>His relationship, or lack thereof, with his mother is complex: He never hates her. He feels her everywhere: She passes through him as an apparition, and everything comes back to her in one way or another. ""I love you more than the world can contain/ In its lonely and ramshackle head,"" he sings. He doesn't cast blame. ""Fourth of July"", a tender song about her death, is filled with terms of endearment (""my little hawk,"" ""my firefly""), and questions about how he can raise her from the dead and then make the most of his own life, before he ends the song by repeating, soberly, ""We're all gonna die.""</p>
<p>The lyrics here are masterful and carefully shorn, and the music is as well. Stevens is joined by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4517-laura-veirs/"">Laura Veirs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28938-s-carey/"">S. Carey</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1258-doveman/"">Thomas Bartlett</a>, and others, but they come off as ghosts in the room around his carefully constructed soundscapes, compositions that tastefully blend acoustic and electronic elements that grow deeper with each listen. There are pianos, organs, starry washes, smears of synthesizers, clicking percussion, unidentifiable pulses, doubled vocals, soaring background harmonies, and quickly picked acoustic guitars that will remind you of Elliott Smith. In the past he'd get showy with multi-part suites or huge arrangements; the writing here is just as ambitious, but never showy. You often forget the music's there, but when you don't, it's catchy, inventive, melodic, seamless. The haunting production, too, is minimal but fathomless.</p>
<p>Stevens has been making music for a long time, and <i>Carrie &amp; Lowell</i> shines a light back on the rest of his oeuvre. You realize the story of <i>Michigan</i>'s ""Romulus"" is heartbreakingly real, down to its references to Oregon (""Once when our mother called/ She had a voice of last year's cough/ We passed around the phone/ Sharing a word about Oregon""), and that desperate desire for even one touch: ""Once when we moved away/ She came to Romulus for a day/ Her Chevrolet broke down/ We prayed it'd never be fixed or be found/ We touched her hair."" He loves his mother, and is ashamed of her, and can't stop loving her. It's one example of many, and when you re-listen to the past albums, and songs like ""The Seer's Tower"" and its once mysterious ""Oh, my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us,"" it acts as a skeleton key to what was once an ineffable sadness. As he put it in ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr."": ""Even in my best behavior I am really just like him/ Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid."" Here are those secrets laid bare.</p>
<p>There is a photo in the booklet of a young Stevens, at the table, eating a banana. It's one of a few photos in the booklet that seem to depict some of those Oregon summers: a beach spotted with rocks, a small half-painted wooden house near trees and hills. His look is not happy or sad; he's just a kid at a table, eating. But there's something melancholic there, something maybe you add onto it after listening to <i>Carrie &amp; Lowell</i>, but something real nonetheless: His mother is standing beside him. She's not looking at him, but she's there. (She appears in three shots, and in none of them can you see her eyes.) You imagine Lowell took the picture (on the back of the booklet you see his reflection in the mirror of a photo taken of Carrie crocheting). It's a haunting feeling that that little kid, years later, would create a masterpiece so knowing about suffering, sadness, death, and loneliness. In that photo, though, he's still a kid, with all those kid hurts, trying to make sense of the world. And, at least for that moment, he's close to his mother. And it seems like maybe he's happy.</p></div>"|20218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20218-carrie-lowell/|9.3|Brandon Stosuy

Part of the pleasure to be derived from the Prodigy's sixth studio album comes from the fact that there's really no reason, in 2015, for the Prodigy still to exist. A quarter-century, after all, is an awfully long time to try to hold a sneer, but that's precisely what they've been doing since Liam Howlett founded the group in 1990 with a couple of dancers, Keith Flint and Leeroy Thornhill. While the U.K. raved under the sign of a giant yellow smiley face, the Prodigy adopted a demonic rictus.</p>
<p>That attitude, paired with Howlett's machine-gun breakbeats, mangled cartoon samples, and acid-metal amalgams, repeatedly took the group to the upper reaches of the British pop charts, and it helped them become one of the first British dance acts to break America when they signed a rumored $5 million contract—with Madonna's Maverick label, no less—for their 1997 album <i>The Fat of the Land</i>, a Trojan Horse for ""electronica"" that also paved the way for a lot of regrettable rap-rock. That record's concussive repercussions can still be felt through all manner of dance music that is loud, aggressive, and in love with its own transgressions: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKaL7WL-onI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Express Yourself""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUDVMiITOU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Turn Down for What""</a>, you name it.</p>
<p>But the Prodigy never really seemed to <i>matter</i> in quite the same way again. After a seven-year wait, 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6486-always-outnumbered-never-outgunned/""><i>Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned</i></a> was a mixed bag of <i>Fat of the Land­</i>-style retreads, and, five years after that, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12706-invaders-must-die/""><i>Invaders Must Die</i></a> sounded like still more rendered <i>Fat</i> drippings rescued from the pan—just beefed up to meet the production standards of the then-ascendant dubstep scene. Perhaps <i>The Day Is My Enemy</i> benefits from the fact that, in the past few years, the zeitgeist has moved on yet again—to hip-hop and R&amp;B, on the one hand, and deeper, moodier shades of dance music on the other—which means that the Prodigy sound increasingly like a genre of one.</p>
<p>The title song, which opens the album, is a malevolent high point. The guitar riff rains down like a buzz bomb and the quarter-note ride cymbal sounds like an anvil; Martina Topley-Bird, of all people, sings a trembling couplet borrowed from Cole Porter's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAawm4OhQJU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Through the Night""</a>. There's a wild, madcap energy to it—I'm reminded, incongruously enough, of Colourbox's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4UasSnTKWE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hot Doggie""</a>, from 4AD's <i>Lonely Is an Eyesore</i> compilation—that carries through the rest of the album's best songs. The double-barreled ""Nasty"" rockets ahead on a distorted <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biwa"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">biwa</a> riff, rolling breakbeats, and call-and-response chants courtesy of longtime vocalists Keith Flint and Maxim, while a woozy Theremin melody taps a winking camp sensibility. ""Destroy"" fuses Belgian rave with skronking baritone sax, while ""Rhythm Bomb"" cribs the chorus of Jomanda's 1988 diva-house tune <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oEFuxl9pKw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Make My Body Rock (Feel It)""</a>.</p>
<p>The best thing on the album, by far, is ""Ibiza"", a breakbeat fusillade stitched together with rayguns and chintzy Hammond organs; pub philosophers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32265-sleaford-mods/"">Sleaford Mods</a> spit the withering hook—""Eye-beetha! Eye-beetha!""—and it's such a natural pairing, you wonder why they don't sing on <i>all </i>of the Prodigy's songs. The Prodigy, for all their anger, have never really been about meaning—just see ""Smack My Bitch Up"", or the equally execrable ""Baby's Got a Temper"", an ode to Rohypnol—but the Mods' sudsy expositions actually manage to lend a layer of depth to the music, even if it does just entail shouting ""Transmit! Transmit! What's he fucking doing?"" over and over.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the lyrics are as corny as ever. In ""Wall of Death"", Maxim and Keith Flint shout, ""You're not ready to visualize/ I'm not here to be sterilized/ Follow me to the wall of death!"" In ""Wild Frontier"", Maxim warns us that we've got to face our fear in the—yeah, you guessed it—wild frontier. And then there's ""Invisible Sun"", a ham-fisted attempt to capture Soundgarden levels of grandeur in trap beats, twangy guitars, and straight-up doggerel: ""Invisible sun, I'm stumbling in the dark/ Invisible sun, a shadow upon the stars/ Invisible sun, shining where there's no path/ Invisible sun, burning out question marks.""</p>
<p>So, yes, there are easily as many misses as hits on the album, and 14 tracks is probably about seven tracks too long. Not to mention that ""Get Your Fight On""—lyrics sadly not written by <a href=""http://www.mnftiu.cc/category/gywo/war81/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Rees</a>—samples Pepe Deluxé's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_d8NhNmiRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Salami Fever""</a>, which the Prodigy already sampled on 2009's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncaNlxvTFzg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Take Me to the Hospital""</a>. Then again, Howlett has been repeating himself in one way or another for some 25 years now; can you blame him for going back to a particularly fertile groove? </p></div>"|20360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20360-the-day-is-my-enemy/|6.0|Philip Sherburne

Frank</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentangle_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pentangle</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/mike-cooper"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently reissued early works</a> of Mike Cooper are all among the examples. On <i>Primrose Green</i>, he embraces those inspirations without wrestling with them. He lugs their aged weight around as signs of good taste and his self-proclaimed place in a historical lineage. Though Walker comes from a mid-sized city in Illinois, he sings as if he bounced between the British Isles as a kid. Alongside his shoplifted accent, he apes Morrison’s trademark grunts and melismas.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: Walker is a prodigious talent. He’s one of the leading young stylists in a crowded instrumental guitar scene. He possesses the light touch of Bert Jansch, the unbottled energy of Peter Walker, and the musical erudition of John Fahey. And he has a Miles Davis-like capability to surround himself with astounding musicians, from early collaborator Daniel Bachman to the band of Chicago jazz firecrackers who not only support him on <i>Primrose Green</i> but also supply many of its best moments. Walker is versatile, too, with a chameleonic quality that allows him to slip into ragged electric blues and bucolic acoustic reveries with equal ease. Of all the songwriters trying their hand at this revivalist approach during the last decade, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31339-steve-gunn/"">Steve Gunn</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30386-hiss-golden-messenger/"">Hiss Golden Messenger</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a>, Walker is the most natural and enviable.</p>
<p>The band he built for <i>Primrose Green</i> is a stirring, captivating ensemble, too, the kind of group that could jam for an uninterrupted hour and never lose an audience’s attention or its own freewheeling focus. During the extended introduction of ""Love Can Be Cruel"", for instance, they delight in the space between folk-rock form and jazz-band freedom. Heavy acoustic strumming, sharp electric guitar and twinkling keyboards dart around a deep rhythm, working into a frenzy until the song approaches the ecstasy of a raga. ""On the Banks of the Old Kishwaukee"" depends upon another stunning groove built by drummer Frank Rosaly and bassist Anton Hatwitch. Walker wires a moaning blues theme into the beat, suggesting the wonderful roots-rock patience of <i>American Beauty</i>-era<i> </i>Grateful Dead. The band sizzles during ""Sweet Satisfaction"", dips and dives during ""Same Minds"", and charges into vibraphone-and-bass bedlam during ""Summer Dress"".</p>
<p>But the trouble comes with Walker—the songwriter and singer, not the instrumentalist. For someone so obsessed with classic troubadours, he has a damning disregard for his own songs. He over-sings almost every part of this record, trying to match his heroes with an inadequate instrument. The screamed lover-boy exhortations of ""Summer Dress"" are counterproductive at best, copycatting at worst. He treats every written syllable of ""Sweet Satisfaction"" like a chance to slur a half-dozen of them, stretching words until it’s easier to ignore them. Walker’s lyrics read like a set of unfinished end-rhyme exercises by a college student who has just discovered the Beats. Smoking grass at night makes him feel ""alright""; leaving his love, however cruel, would make him into a ""fool.""</p>
<p>For a point of contrast, see ""Griffiths Buck Blues"", the one instrumental number on <i>Primrose Green</i>. Over a harmonium drone, Walker musters pure energy and expression with only his guitar. As he starts and stops, slows and sprints, he communicates dread and unease with the conviction his voice lacks. </p>
<p><a href=""http://deadoceans.com/artist.php?name=walkerryley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The extensive biography</a> that accompanies <i>Primrose Green </i>positions it as ""an album of a sort we haven’t seen since the 1970s""—a bit of description perhaps <i>too </i>on the nose, as these 10 songs are acts of pure creative anachronism and affectation. The shape of Walker’s voice and the twists and turns of his band reanimate a specific aesthetic without adding much more than the tools of modern production. While <i>Primrose Green </i>is a great statement for a '70s freak-folk cosplayer, I just hope it’s not a career-defining one for Walker.</p></div>"|20215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20215-primrose-green/|6.2|Grayson Haver Currin

Huge, looping riffs stretch across deeply repetitive percussion, creating an atmosphere somewhere between trance and stupor. The word ""psychedelic"" is never far away when reading descriptions of the band, but three albums into their career, they’ve explored many colors on that particular spectrum. Beginning with outward-facing, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7676-josh-homme/"">Josh Homme</a>-indebted rock on their eponymous debut in 2009, they switched to something closer to krautrock on 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18015-follkazoid-ii/""><i>II</i></a>. Here, they tighten their sound, cutting out the meandering themes and occasionally sloppy riffing. There are only four songs, but extra details emerge slowly on repeat listening.</p>
<p>German producer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwe_Schmidt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Uwe Schmidt</a>, better known as Atom™, has been brought in as a collaborator, bringing the discipline of his immersively repetitive electronic music with him. He’s also credited with playing a Korg synth that belonged to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> during the 1980s. Föllakzoid can’t let go of their roots entirely—at best, they’re channeling the LSD-laced guitar patterns of Loop and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a>; at worst, vocalist Juan Pablo Rodrigues leans too hard on foggy vocal effects that recall Brooklyn psych also-rans (and labelmates) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3486-psychic-ills/"">Psychic Ills</a>. They’re most effective when working somewhere between their rock instincts and Schmidt’s concise approach. Opener ""Electric"" recalls a more-guitar heavy version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>’s ""Get Innocuous!"", where a patient build combines with a subtle layering of elements to deliver the album’s most transcendent moment.</p>
<p>Föllakzoid barely shift course over the 45-minute <i>III</i>. The riff that dominates the closing ""Feuerzeug"" is only a breath away from the one that towers over ""Electric"". ""Piure"" is the best example of that here, mixing up backward-masked electronics, menacing ambient noise, and a guitar churn that sounds like it was played by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>’s Michael Karoli. In general, the album treats its journey as circular, a path of tiny incremental steps that eventually leads us back to where we began. </p>
<p>In 2014 Föllakzoid played a set at Primavera Sound, leaving behind <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-cl=85027636&amp;x-yt-ts=1422503916&amp;v=VJZ1tNTgE18%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this video</a> memento to mark the occasion. The beginning is marked by the reading of a poem by the Chilean writer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Huidobro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vicente Huidobro</a>, which is heavy on birthing and religious imagery, where each line is so dense in implication it’s easy to just disappear into it for a while. It’s a handy comparison for the type of feeling Föllakzoid try to convey in their music, where their vaguely epic songs—only one track here, the nine-minute “Feuerzeug”, is less than 10 minutes in length—gain an allure by gradually stacking up moments of powerful suggestion. It doesn’t always reach the level of spiritual purity it could, but there’s a touch of steel and a sense of pacing that was missing from Föllakzoid’s prior work, positioning <i>III</i> as a gateway for a much a deeper dive into altered states.</p></div>"|20364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20364-iii/|6.5|Nick Neyland

Hugo Pierre Leclercq had bigger conquests in mind. The instrumental ""Imperium"", the first released song from his new <i>Adventure</i>, was first featured on the soundtrack of the globally massive soccer video game ""FIFA 15"". This is a distinction that often breaks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/76-qa-steve-schnur-fifa-2014/"">big artists to a world audience</a>, and Madeon’s mixture of colorful, sample-heavy EDM and its attending uplifting lilt made for the perfect feel-good vibe directly before the complexity of the new ""FIFA"" made you want to hurl your controller through your brother’s flat screen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With <i>Adventure</i>, Madeon’s debut LP, the producer presents a strikingly versatile collection. In a landscape filled with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67qworViFpY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hot-on-paper-but-kinda-""eh"" collaborations</a> between big name vocalists and hip producers, Madeon deploys his guests (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"">Passion Pit</a>, R&amp;B singer Kyan, Bastille frontman Dan Smith) with a stirring effectiveness. Album highlight ""Pay No Mind"" weaponizes Passion Pit's bright synth-pop for a stadium anthem, and the warmth of ""La Lune"" recalls a more laidback version of Bastille’s catchy hit ""Pompeii"". On tracks like ""OK""—which features a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"">Charli XCX</a> sample culled from a scrapped collaboration—and ""Pixel Empire"", Madeon pays homage to 8-bit video game soundtracks, reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16498-essential-mix/"">Essential Mix</a> and the incomparable (yes, incomparable) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz-nnTzUQUg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Donkey Kong Country"" soundtrack </a>all at once. While <i>Adventure</i> carries all the hallmarks of your usual skyscraping EDM release—stomping breakdowns, soaring choruses, maximalism-for-the-sake-of-it—it also straddles a fine balance between being a pop record and being a dance record.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though not everything is as huge as its banner singles, more inward-looking tracks like the closer ""Home"" are arguably as successful. ""Home"" perhaps best exemplifies Madeon’s range, given that it’s one of the only songs on the album that features Leclercq’s vocals. Over a track that moves from delicate and glimmering to sweeping, Leclercq sings delicately before jumping into the thundering chorus. It’s a sweet note to end on, and marks a signpost for the young producer to follow, if he chooses that direction. The good thing about <i>Adventure</i> is that there are many markers like this; on the path to what feels like something huge, Madeon’s journey is just beginning.</p></div>"|20379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20379-adventure/|7.8|Corban Goble

The tape itself was vintage Future but also magnificently petty, and it went mostly underappreciated as a result. He continued his strong run with the Zaytoven-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20166-future-beast-mode/""><i>Beast Mode</i></a>, which was an equally snappy but less petulant response to his emotional turmoil. After announcing plans <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2015/03/future-announces-dirty-sprite-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">earlier this month</a> to keep the ball rolling with a sequel to 2011’s <i>Dirty Sprite</i> on Twitter, Future unexpectedly dropped <i>56 Nights, </i>the latest in what feels like a sustained campaign.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The mixtape's title refers to the amount of time Future’s DJ, Esco, spent in a Dubai jail on a trip to the 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. It’s officially billed as a DJ Esco tape hosted by Future, the first since 2013’s <i>No Sleep</i>, but unlike that 23-track offering, featuring contributions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32662-shy-glizzy/"">Shy Glizzy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31028-young-scooter/"">Young Scooter</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32494-peewee-longway/"">PeeWee Longway</a>, 5<i>6 Nights</i> is Future standing alone with no guests. When he raps ""None of this money that matter; all of my niggas, they matter"" on ""Diamonds From Africa"", it feels like an acknowledgement of his DJ’s ordeal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Future still has other problems, too, and like <i>Beast Mode</i> and <i>Monster</i> before it, <i>56 Nights</i> hints at the lingering effects from his soured relationship. Where many songs on <i>Beast Mode</i> found Future trying to sort out the pain of estrangement in the embrace of other women, <i>56 Nights</i> drowns in a potent drug concoction that influences both its sound and his addled, prattling lyrics, which often give way to profound moments of clarity. Casual sex is often written off as tedious, only spurred on by copious drug use (""I didn’t wanna fuck the bitch/ This molly made me fuck her even though she average,"" on ""March Madness""; ""I pour up again and again/ I said I wasn’t gonna fuck with that bitch then I fucked her again,"" on ""Never Gon Lose""). The overarching theme is reliance on drugs over women, a preference he spells out on ""Purple Comin In"": ""Fuck a bitch on that shit, I don’t need her"" versus ""Fell in love with that drank and I need it."" Future seems to have developed a codependency on pharmaceuticals, one that fills a void and levels his unease—on ""Trap Niggas"" he raps, ""I’m drinking Activis, the only thing that relax me""—and this continuous state of inebriation allows Future to be remarkably open.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The bulk of the production on <i>56 Nights </i>is handled by Southside with one song produced by Tarentino. Both are members of 808 Mafia, the in-house production team of Waka Flocka Flame’s Brick Squad Monopoly, and Future follows their unhinged, woozy lead, lining knocking 808s with frenetic flows that fumble into mumbling like on ""No Compadre"".  He occasionally offers brief bits of social commentary and self-reflection: On ""March Madness"" he sings ""All these cops shooting niggas, tragic"" and on ""Trap Niggas"", ""I got a lower case T across my chest/ Your crack house doing numbers then you blessed/ You move your mama to a crib from the 'jects."" The ideas arrive as garbled fragments that, when pieced together, tell his story, and <i>56 Nights</i> is an unfiltered look at life through the eyes of a wasted Future.</p></div>"|20424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20424-56-nights/|7.3|Sheldon Pearce

As she’s grown, she’s moved farther in this direction, away from the plain-spoken vulnerability of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12134-alas-i-cannot-swim/""><i>Alas, I Cannot Swim </i></a>into <span>vocals that curl words into secretive murmurs, and lyrics that tiptoe up to confessions then stop just short. </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPvKcGe0E5w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mythology</a> and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubdWPJSCbos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>formal allusions</span></a><span> swirl around even her candid moments, assuring that any autobiography is lost in the fog.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So it’s a mild shock to hear Marling sing ""We shared an apartment on the Upper West Side"" toward the beginning of her fifth record </span><span><i>Short Movie</i>. The lyric is rooted</span><span> to a specific place, a specific happening in her life. It’s even a precise moment—2012’s post-Hurricane Sandy blackout, which left most of lower Manhattan without power and ""dark, as if no one lives there,"" as she says on ""False Hope"". In interviews, Marling acknowledges <i>Short Movie</i> is more unguarded, though characteristically only to a point: ""The arm’s distance was getting closer with this record for sure, but then I stopped,"" </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/01/laura-marling-short-movie-i-got-my-childish-wonder-back"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>she told </span><span>The Guardian</span></a><span>, </span><span>declining to elaborate.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In part, the new sense of openness comes from the sound.<i> Short Movie</i></span><span> is her first album written on electric guitar—specifically, her father’s old Gibson 335. It’s not a drastic change, as Marling’s uptempo tracks have always had </span><span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO2gm29rI7E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">muscle</a>, </span><span>but it’s palpable nevertheless. Marling toured </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18066-laura-marling-once-i-was-an-eagle/""><i>Once I Was an Eagle</i></a><span> with longtime cellist Ruth de Turberville (who contributes lovely arrangements on </span><i>Short Movie</i><span>) but little else in the way of a band or instrumentation, and on<i> Short Movie</i>, she clutches every guitar fill like it’s a long-lost piece of her identity, luxuriating in space and writing bigger and hazier songs to match. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The arrangement on ""Warrior"", for instance, is stranded atop a canyon of echo and given an arrangement so vast and dusty that Marling almost gets away with the America rip (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAJ0l4OBHM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yes, that one</a>). ""Warrior"" is hauntingly serious, but elsewhere you can hear here loosening up: ""Strange,"" a near-spoken disembowelment of a hapless cheating man, wouldn’t work without the cruelest hitch of a laugh in Marling’s voice as she informs him, ""I don’t love you… I’m pretty sure that you know."" It’s easily the standout: every syllable delivered like acid, and lyrics that continually walk up to the line and cross it—right up to ""No, I do not believe we were born equally.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Short Movie</i> has been called Marling’s ""quarterlife crisis"" album, but the crises she's grappling here are the same ones she's confronted her entire career: love as a threat to autonomy, suitors as perpetual disappointments, wariness of intimacy but also of the alternatives. Album opener ""Warrior"" is a mythological conceit typical of Marling—men as warriors, women as the steeds they misuse. Marling is the sort of artist to deliver ""I feel your love"" like it’s synonymous with fear, or choking gas; ""Walk Alone"" is the sound of a woman who’s sat with herself long enough to realize, horrified, that what she hears inside is a lonely-morning dirge.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This turns out to be <i>Short Movie</i>’s main, minor downfall: Most of these themes were explored, in more eviscerating detail, in <i>Once I Was an Eagle</i>, and the album meanders in the second half. Without an overarching conceit like <i>Once I Was an Eagle,</i> <i>Short Movie</i> comes off sounding like a transition record, a short movie in the sense that it’s a prelude to something bigger. But Marling’s career is remarkable in part because album after album she not only delivers on those bigger things, but delivers them in her idiosyncratic voice. S<span>he’s spent her entire career dodging comparisons, but by now she has earned the right to be compared only to herself.</span></p></div>"|20377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20377-short-movie/|7.4|Katherine St. Asaph

Their music can feel like a trek through a </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihextXXsLew"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>forbidding city winter</span></a><span>, so it’s fitting that the group holed up in December to craft the quick-hit </span><span>follow up EP </span><i>700 Fill</i><span>. Though it arrives at the tail end of an uncommonly brutal cold season and literally namechecks North Face jacket models and the grade of their goose-down filling on a song (""Steep Tech""), </span><span><i>700 Fill </i></span><span>is a lighter, breezier listen than its predecessor, thanks to the group’s eagerness to toy with its sound and writing process.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Much of </span><i>700 Fill </i><span>was written in just a week by rappers Wiki and Hak over beats that producer Sporting Life pieced together ahead of recording. The lack of an overarching concept gives the new material a freer feel, as Wiki trades grizzled storytelling for battle raps and rhyme acrobatics. Still, there are gems here: ""Arnold Palmer"" kicks a metaphor comparing the titular ice tea and lemonade hybrid to Wiki’s own biracial heritage while pining for a cold Brisk and a fat J on a rooftop in summer, while ""Bethel"" triumphantly renounces </span><span><i>So It Goes</i></span><span>’ high school graduate career anxiety after a year of good press and extensive touring. </span><i>700 Fill </i><span>cycles between fleshed out cuts and looser lyrical workouts like ""Lenape Lane"" and ""Sticky Trap"" but even the most perfunctory of these exercises are intriguing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Wiki’s internal rhyme-heavy raps and Hak’s airy hooks were occasionally too divergent to gel on </span><i>So It Goes</i><span>, but with </span><i>700 Fill</i><span>, Ratking seems to be figuring out what to do with Hak. The EP confidently cuts him loose on intros, bridges and outros as a confectionary dusting to Wiki’s gruff veneer, although he’s still working out what to do when he’s tossed an entire verse on ""Lenape Lane"" and ""Bethel"". </span><i>700 Fill</i><span>’s not afraid to throw the Wiki-Hak balancing act out the window, though: The two best cuts here are ""Eternal Reveal"", a gossamer Hak reverie with a short Wiki verse stuck in the middle, and ""Flurry"", a spitfire Wiki solo cut. Sporting Life’s taking verses too, and the brusque, unpolished humor of his voice is a reminder that home base for the group is Harlem.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With Ratking’s rapping axis exploring new forms of expression, <i>700 Fill </i>is really a showcase for Sporting Life. He’s eased off the needling skronk of <i>So It Goes </i>and the group’s debut EP <i>Wiki93</i> in favor of spacier, more melodic textures. ""American Gods"" and ""Eternal Reveal"" both revisit Sport’s knack for flaying a sample beyond recognition but drop his trademark willful dissonance, the former in service of a soulful sendup of New York’s Just Blaze era and the latter, an idyllic waltz. Otherwise, Sport prefers affixing trap drums to winding, ghostly synth lines to dizzying effect. Imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/173-dan-the-automator/"">Dan the Automator</a> popping in the Mike WiLL era.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>700 Fill</i> </span><span>is the sound of Ratking pulling its sound apart between albums to feel around for what works and doesn’t. Its off-the-cuff sound and free Bittorrent release strategy suggest a group attempting to sidestep the press and PR machine to sneak around and find itself. ""We’re talking about practice,"" Wiki sneers in ""Bethel"", quoting a </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d29VsG35DQM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>classic press conference</span></a><span> from NBA superstar Allen Iverson. ""Not the game!"" If Wiki, Hak and Sport are just in warm-ups here, the form is still on point.</span></p></div>"|20355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20355-700-fill-ep/|7.2|Craig Jenkins

The fact that he’s now a <a href=""http://warp.net/artists/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a> mainstay is fitting—much of the music on <i>Flame Rave</i>, a four-track EP that follows his excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19905-clark-clark/""><i>Clark</i></a> LP from last year, mirrors the future vision mapped out in the label’s earliest releases. It doesn’t imagine a world much beyond the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11714-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-ii/""><i>Artificial Intelligence</i></a> compilation or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3360-polygon-window/"">Polygon Window</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6393-surfing-on-sine-waves/""><i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i></a>, where the future remains all burning chrome and collapsing new buildings. It’s to his credit that Clark can survey such a thoroughly excavated space and scrape out something worthwhile from it, and <i>Flame Rave</i> pushes on the <i>Clark</i> thread of big-theme dystopia until it begins to resemble something like a great dynastic collapse.</p>
<p>Several worlds converge here, merged by Clark's skill and experience. There’s something of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-haxan-cloak/"">the Haxan Cloak</a>’s deliberate hugeness, as well as the sense of techno shifting from a harbinger to a retro-future marker. On ""Silver Sun"", the EP’s lead track but also its weakest, Clark knots up a jungle breakbeat with slow-moving loops, drawing out a subtle sense of conflict that ties into his fascination with technology that throws up error messages everywhere. He never drives his music to the point of total malfunction, instead positioning himself in the gulf between a great night out and a bad one. ""Silver Sun"" even ends with some rave-y whoops and cheers, but it’s thoroughly backgrounded and filtered through heavy distortion, making it feel like a vicarious thrill at best.</p>
<p>The idea of Clark on the outside of club culture looking in is something he’s touched on in interviews. He has the air of an observer at times, while at others he’s deeply engaged, and it’s when he entwines both modes that his music becomes engrossing. ""To Live and Die in Grantham"", its title perhaps a nod to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, builds around trance techno patterns that recall the ""pure trance"" version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26142-klf/"">the KLF</a>’s <a href=""https://youtu.be/GgdfbbgEsyI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Time Is Love""</a>, which surely comes from a lifetime of studying the form. But it’s all wrapped up in rushes of warm, emotive electronics, suggesting someone keen to move his audience in both brain and body. </p>
<p>The cover of <i>Flame Rave</i> shows a face split into light and dark. It mirrors the scaly black-and-white picture from the sleeve of <i>Clark</i>, but the juxtaposition of color neatly reflects the progression he’s made from one of his most acclaimed albums to date. <i>Flame Rave</i> finds a little more joy, a little more to celebrate, among the retro-terror his music often evokes. If <i>Clark</i> was the sound of someone scaling an awesome peak, this is the point where he settles in, throws a big party, and gets caught up in pure emotion.</p></div>"|20399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20399-flame-rave-ep/|6.9|Nick Neyland

For </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4234-thursday"" target=""_blank"">Thursday</a>, this cohort<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> appears to be smaller than most.</span> In fact, the overwhelming consensus is that <i>Waiting</i> is their least potent work, an opinion that’s less uncomfortable to hold knowing that it <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/rank-your-records-thursday-geoff-rickly"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">is also Geoff Rickly’s</a>. But that’s more a reflection on the overall strength of their catalog and how every Thursday record managed to be superlative in its own way: <i>Full Collapse</i> is the most influential; <i>War All the Time</i> the heaviest; <i>A City by the Light Divided</i> remains their most melodic, <i>A Common Existence</i> their most brutal; and <i>No Devolución</i> their most comprehensive. <i>Waiting</i> simply stands as Thursday’s most promising and earnest album.</div>
<p>These are qualities that are granted retroactively, and the slick packaging of this reissue (including their now-iconic dove logo, which didn't actually appear until <i>War All the Time</i>) realigns <i>Waiting</i> as part of Thursday’s arc rather than an outlier. While it’s easy to appreciate because of what it led to, <i>Waiting</i> managed to stand out at the time because of Rickly’s passionate, verbose lyrics and near-frightening intensity. This was by far the most developed aspect of Thursday’s sound in 2000 and would continue to set them apart even as a still-healthy record industry figured out what the hell to do with them.</p>
<p>At the time of <i>Waiting</i>, Thursday didn’t quite know where they stood either. The music itself is agitated, propulsive. ""Porcelain"" was inspired by the suicide of a friend and begins the record expounding on the heartbreaking fragility of life itself, contrasted with Rickly’s anger and resentment towards a society unwilling to take the smallest steps to protect those who might not be able to help themselves. Rickly also advocated for ramped-up suicide prevention measures and tighter background checks for gun buyers in the lyrics sheet.</p>
<p>The same overwhelming frustration courses through ""Dying in New Brunswick"", perhaps the most tortured track Rickly would ever write. As with most of <i>Waiting</i>, it’s drawn from his own experience<span>—</span>his girlfriend at the time moved to the titular city and was raped within a week. Rickly tries to understand her trauma (""In these city streets I hide my face/ I turn away when you look at me/ And every night when I try to sleep/ I can feel your hands all over my body"") as well as cultural mores and legal hurdles that causes the victim to blame themselves (""They say it doesn’t happen that often/ But it’s happening right now""). The only thing the two songs share is a longing for escape, from the city, from everything<span>—</span>death is preferable to the liminal state of <i>dying.</i></p>
<p>It’s extremely bleak stuff, to the point where a song called ""Ian Curtis"" is one of the <i>least</i> harrowing. Like many, I arrived at <i>Waiting</i> only after discovering <i>Full Collapse</i><i>,</i> and I heard the chorus of ""Ian Curtis"" as a prescient barb at the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division"">Joy Division</a> worshippers that would overrun neighboring New York City years later: ""I heard Ian Curtis hang himself again in your band."" <span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">As it turns out, it’s ""in your bed"", and the scene is actually of Rickly and an ex listening to Joy Division in bed together.</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> Given this rueful context, as well as that of ""Porcelain"", the image reflects on the absurdity of romanticizing suicide.</span> </span>""Ian Curtis"" is followed by an instrumental called ""Introduction""; who wouldn’t want a breather and restart after all of this?</p>
<p>Such is the urgency of <i>Waiting</i>, with Rickly so inspired to just get this weight off him that the band didn’t have time to really figure out what to do besides <i>push</i>. Occasionally, you can hear the sheared, trebly guitars of Texas Is the Reason (whose Norm Brannon heads up <a href=""http://collectrecords.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Collect Records</a> with Rickly), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a>’s more ruminative moments, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3986-sunny-day-real-estate"">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>’s yearning, exploratory passages. Thursday had too much of a melodic underpinning for ""screamo"" or even ""post-hardcore"" to really stick, but they had yet to figure out how much to commit to pop. On ""Porcelain"", Rickly can barely catch his breath chasing its cyclical melody, unable to fully give the chorus the boost it needs; by <i>Full Collapse</i>, they’d learn to explode on ""Understanding in a Car Crash"" and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYvwXYs1x7w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Standing on the Edge of Summer""</a>. At times, it’s the sound of a band throwing songs together rather than crafting them: On ""In Transmission"" the dissonance between Rickly’s melodies and the lead guitar unintentionally serve its central metaphor of communication breakdowns. There are strong moments, but everything that <i>Waiting</i> did well, <i>Full Collapse</i> did better.</p>
<p>But the same could be said of <i>Full Collapse</i> in relation to Thursday’s future works. In fact, <i>Waiting</i> gives hints of how they’d progress even beyond their commercial breakthrough. The violins are a nice touch on ""This Side of Brightness"", but they’re just a touch; on <i>No Devolución</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4l6MFI6Xc0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart""</a>, Thursday knew how to be orchestral. The social conscience that started to emerge on ""The Circle Ends"" would be fully explored on <i>War All the Time</i> and <i>A Common Existence</i>. And then there’s the last song they ever recorded, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IupVaAh4sw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stay True""</a>—Rickly’s addressing an up-and-coming punk rock band and giving advice on what it’s like to be young, ambitious, idealistic, thin-skinned and prone to relying on outside validation. It never sounded patronizing or condescending; anyone who’s heard <i>Waiting</i> knows that Rickly and Thursday have been in that same position.</p></div>"|20375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20375-waiting/|6.5|Ian Cohen

The band seems to have designed it that way: Along with the guitars and percussion, there are horns, strings, constantly hammering glockenspiel, even bagpipes, all blaring at once, like 11 open browser tabs autoplaying or a block of car alarms set off by a passing motorcycle. Hunter Hunt-Hendrix, the band’s leading force and <i>The Ark Work</i>’s primary arranger, has talked in interviews about realizing the sound in his head; <i>The Ark Work</i>, he claims, is the closest he’s come to sharing it with us. The sound he's designed here feels purposefully <i>too</i> large, a pressurized force exploding out of confinement. Hearing it feels like watching someone's head split open, which might be an appropriate image for a band so concerned with themes of annihilation and rebirth.</p>
<p>The second way to experience <i>The Ark Work</i> is as a kind of aesthetic gauntlet, hurled with an audible <i>clunk</i>. Liturgy’s previous albums, 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13915-renihilation/""><i>Renihilation</i></a> and 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15427-aesthethica/""><i>Aesthethica</i></a>, cast Hunt-Hendrix’s imposing ideas—which he has tried to clarify, perhaps comically, in a pair of perfectly inscrutable diagrams included with <i>The Ark Work</i>’s packaging—in songlike forms. <i>The Ark Work</i> is closer, in its 57-minute expanse and grandeur, to a symphony—something long and Germanic, maybe by Bruckner. Long sections of it hang stubbornly in place, pitched between bedlam and boredom, before surging over another exhilarating crag in the music’s development.</p>
<p>Recurring themes pop up, like alpine flowers dotting a mountainside. ""Follow"", the album’s first full track, begins with a chiming contrapuntal figure in the glockenspiels, led by pedal tones in the bass line. It has a fragile, otherworldly quality, which the band snuffs out briskly when it plunges in moments later. The theme resurfaces a few tracks later, on ""Follow II"", played by an organ, on ""Haelegen"", and then again on ""Total War"". Each time, it feels like a welcome space for contemplation amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>These moments provide navigable markers on what can frankly be an imposing, even dismaying listen. <i>The Ark Work</i> is harmonically rich, but <i>very</i> slow; to say that it moves is to point out that glass is technically a liquid. The most awe-inspiring payoffs occur after agonizing liftoff: On ""Follow II"", strings and horns lifts the music up, like pigeons on strings tied to a Mahlerian orchestra. The mass seems to hang an inch or two above ground, groaning and threatening to split open, before the seams burst and Hunt-Hendrix’s little voice spills out.</p>
<p>This sense of watching an impossible bulk lift skyward is the most thrilling sensation <i>The Ark Work</i> provides, and it happens two or three times across the album. In these moments, Hunt-Hendrix’s thrashing ambitions feel justified, and they position Liturgy not as descendants of black metal but of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>, eager to chase exhilaration to punishing, Herculean extremes. The crazed energy of <i>Ark</i>’s best music feels indebted to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzcarraldo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Werner Herzog’s </a><i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzcarraldo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fitzcarraldo</a><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzcarraldo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></i>, and Hunt-Hendrix has more than a touch of Herzog’s maddening genius/genius madman dynamic about him. In both cases, the primary question haunting the project's edges is ""Is this guy kidding?""</p>
<p><i>The Ark Work</i> has another unfortunate Herzog parallel, and it’s a specific one: In order to enjoy the grand vision before you, you have to block the sometimes-irritating sound of the creator’s voice from your ears. On previous albums, Hunt-Hendrix screamed in a register that was both shocking and oddly delicate, like gift wrap tearing. On <i>The Ark Work</i>, he drones on a single note, with very little variation, for most of the time. It sounds deadening on first contact, and it doesn’t reveal much depth on repeated listens. He seems to be aiming for a trancelike, occult mood, and he has referenced the triplet flows of Three 6 Mafia as inspiration. The long incantatory passages of ""Quetzalcoatl"" and ""Father Vorizen"", which seem like his most direct attempts at applying this rhythm, offer a handy example of just how far a sound can travel from its origin.</p>
<p>That is a charitable way of saying that his vocals often border on unendurable. On ""Father Vorizen"", his droning is mostly tuneless and nearly rhythmless, a persistent hum that you find yourself wanting to swat away. Because it is competing with massive elements, his voice has been doubled up and set slightly to the side in the mix, making him sound less an entranced cult leader, stoking the flames, than someone mumbling in a corner. When he moans ""The doors of perception will open and close/ Hope will exist in a problematic relationship with reason/ Libidinal energy will whirl round like a rattle rattling/ Hearts will be stopped bones will shatter shattering,"" on ""Quetzalcoatl"", the prevailing knock on Liturgy as a dog-and-pony show for Hunt-Hendrix’s half-baked musings feels uncomfortably close at hand.</p>
<p>It is an unfair judgment to pass on the glorious, rippling full-band unit, however: Greg Fox, one of the most intuitive, thrilling, and musical drummers of his generation, is back in the band, and his playing, as it did on <i>Aesthethica</i>, feels truer to the spirit of Hunt-Hendrix’s philosophy than any of his declarations. The band plays with tremendous power, verve, and energy, but the results feel leaden, even after dozens of listens. For all of its dense conceptual underpinnings, <i>The Ark Work</i> comes up curiously short on new ideas long before the album ends.  The stretch of music covering the album’s first five tracks—""Fanfare"" to ""Quetzalcoatl""—invokes awe, terror, confusion, joy, despair. At this point, however, <i>The Ark Work</i> is less than half over. Inevitably, some chair-squirming occurs. Fatigue sets in; interest ebbs. This is the flip side of grandeur: When you stretch it out far enough, it becomes difficult to distinguish from terminal boredom.</p></div>"|20313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20313-the-ark-work/|6.4|Jayson Greene

Paul Rose, got his start making dubstep in the now-classic sense—heads-down, skunked-out, half-time steppers—but as UK dubstep evolved into ""bass music,"" Scuba seemed the likeliest candidate to graduate to festival main stages. After a string of singles whose titles spoke to his newfound ambitions—""Adrenalin"", ""Flash Addict"", ""Hardbody""—he capped off his transformation with 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16341-personality/""><i>Personality</i></a>, which married his sumptuous sound design to ecstatic piano house riffs, thundering four-to-the-floor bangers, and echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">the Chemical Brothers</a>' stadium-filling big beat.</p>
<p>But Rose made <i>Claustrophobia</i> in a year that, for health reasons, he took off from touring, and perhaps as a result,<i> </i>the album spends as much time looking inward as it does contemplating the reactions of the massing crowds. Stylistically, the album is roughly split between techno, ambient, and IDM; with one foot in the living room and one foot in the club, it suggests that Scuba's ""big room"" phase is over, at least for now.</p>
<p>Rose certainly hasn't turned his back on dancers; ""Television"", ""PCP"", and ""Black on Black"" are among the heaviest tracks in his catalog. So is the brilliant ""Why You Feel So Low"", a throbbing monster whose glowing low end faintly echoes the best of <i>Consumed</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3330-plastikman/"">Plastikman</a>. But his approach to techno is idiosyncratic. The pulsating ""Levitation"", left untethered to a kick drum, becomes an ambient track almost by default, and the same thing happens to the aptly named ""Drift"". A more conventional artist would have chained both to a four-to-the-floor anchor, but Rose seems to have faith that the listener doesn't always need a metronomic handrail. </p>
<p>Scuba's music has always <i>sounded</i> wonderful—warm, rich, enveloping, ultra-vivid—but <i>Claustrophobia </i>feels like a major step up; the sonics are simply dazzling. Rattled keys, wind chimes, rubbed wineglass rims, half-heard voices, and all manner of incidental rustle serve to make the music leap from the speakers. ""All I Think About Is Death"" pairs those tricks with a woman's mournful singing to create an entrancing update of trip-hop. ""Needle Phobia"" starts out as a dead ringer for the drone that opens <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume II </i>before morphing into a shuddering tribute to the sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>'s <i>Amber</i> LP. And then there's ""Family Entertainment""—just two-and-a-half minutes of wailing babies and hospital acoustics that swell into a disconcerting fluttering in the ears. As it dissolves into a spray of static, it has the ring of hard-won epiphany.</p>
<p>There's a moment on ""Television"" where the music just <i>stops</i>, with a massive crescendo giving way to nothing but a thumping kick drum. It <span>feels a little bit like that gag in the Road Runner cartoons where Wile E. Coyote goes skittering off over the edge of the cliff, and the same anticlimactic fake-out crops up again on </span>""Drift"", a moody thrum that briefly threatens to go full-bore and then changes its mind at the last minute: There's a heart-in-mouth crescendo, a roll of the drums, and then, just where you'd expect pyrotechnics, inky silence. And it happens again on ""Black on Black"", the kind of sooty, industrial-tinged banger that Scuba can seemingly turn out in his sleep. It's a clever trick: instead of beating audiences over the head, it reels them in; instead of projecting outwards, it reflects inwards.</p>
<p>Scuba's album titles have always tended to read pretty literally: <i>Triangulation </i>suggested his path through dance music's crowded waters, tacking and jibing between techno and dubstep; <i>Personality</i> reflected the swagger of a newfound confidence. But <i>Claustrophobia </i>doesn't seem quite so straightforward. Far from sounding backed into a corner, after a strategic retreat from the big time, Rose seems right at home.</p></div>"|20296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20296-claustrophobia/|8.1|Philip Sherburne

""To the south, dictators on altars...To the west, missiles pierce the shallow graves"", intones vocalist Chi Orengo, mixing allusions to geopolitical turmoil with imagery of contemporary warfare. Like<i> Nasty Witch Rock</i> writ large, this ominous missive is rife with goth-rock melodrama. Orengo’s theatrical delivery harks to 1980s Angeleno acts like Red Scare and 45 Grave, while Anasazi’s serpentine guitar leads evoke Rikk Agnew’s cascading, chorus-laden riffs for Christian Death’s debut. The tom-tom thump recalls London's Batcave club, and blackened UK anarcho-punk outliers like the Mob and Amebix loom prominently. Despite these signifiers, Anasazi—who formed in 2010 and have recorded a handful of prior demos and EPs—find sly ways to subvert genre convention, mingling goth tropes with fantasies of retribution upon the criminal justice system and its shills.</p>

Rather, the black ceremonies in Orengo’s lyrics are deployed against the state.

Anasazi’s mystic insurgency is a clever conceit, appealing to fans of B-horror campiness and an era’s exasperation with federal gridlock. Legislation and litigation are mere salves on the political system’s fetid carcass, Anasazi suggests, so ""Hex da System"" instead. The lyrics booklet includes instructions.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unfortunately, the production on <i>Nasty Witch Rock </i>is just dismal, rendering most of the lyrics unintelligible and flattening the dynamic range. On albums by Toxic State label-mates and scene peers like Crazy Spirit and Hank Wood &amp; the Hammerheads, piss-poor fidelity helped thicken the punk bands' violent churn. But for Anasazi, it saps vigor from what should be intensifying turnarounds and builds. On ""Maniac in the Mirror"", the saturated guitar and stifled cackles feel limp, while the tuneful co-vocals on ""Thelema’s Will"" and ""Morbid Native"" get squandered by inscrutable mixing. That it was produced by Ben Greenberg—who’s perfectly deft with heavy, bleak music, as evidenced by recent work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31728-the-ukiah-drag/"">Ukiah Drag</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19670-the-ukiah-drag-in-the-reapers-quarters/""><i>In the Reaper's Quarters</i></a>—is vexing.</p>
<p>But the most vivid illustration of <i>Nasty Witch Rock</i>’s shortcomings is Anasazi’s earlier, better-produced 7”s, ""I Saw the Witch Cry"" and ""Attic Noise"", released in 2012 by <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a> and Toxic State, respectively. On ""Bone Collector"", from ""Attic Noise"", Orengo’s voice is harrowing, the drums are muscular, and the guitar riffs sound like ice picks to <i>Nasty Witch Rock</i>’s mushy snow. The sonic definition gives Anasazi’s song arrangements real menace, which in turn boosts the potency and power of Orengo’s occult chants. With three songs running over 15 minutes, ""Attic Noise"" is Anasazi’s most compelling cry for a coven’s coup d'etat. <i>Nasty Witch Rock, </i>meanwhile,<i> </i>suffers from a studio seance gone awry.</p></div>"|20383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20383-anasazi-nasty-witch-rock/|6.5|Sam Lefebvre

As Jesse Malin portrays her—or someone like her—in ""Oh Sheena"", from his new album <i>New York Before the War</i>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">Ramones</a>’ mascot is older and wiser, stuck perhaps in the kind of dead-end life she once dreaded, but not cynical just yet. ""There’s a world outside if you want it, there’s a world outside you can know,"" Malin promises her, wondering if we can realize any of those dreams we let slip away when we became adults. Sheena has to be in her late 50s or early 60s, but he believes it’s never too late to live up to the promise of her teenage rebellion. Nearly 40 years after <i>Rocket to Russia</i>, she can still break away.</p>
<p>Even if it’s more about a punk ideal than an actual flesh-and-blood person, ""Oh Sheena"" works up some genuine poignancy as Malin, a rock'n'roll veteran of more than two decades, surveys his own past. In the 1990s he came up with the band D Generation, who were so mired in New York rock history that they co-opted the gutter glam and platform shoes of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4889-new-york-dolls/"">New York Dolls</a>. After four albums the group disbanded and Malin launched a solo career defined by critical raves and commercial indifference. Riddled with references to local landmarks and local bands, <i>New York Before the War </i>is both the record he’s been trying to make his entire career and the record he’s been making all along: a collection of songs defined by New York City, beholden to its history and his place within it.</p>
<p>That title may be a reference to the studio where he recorded the album, which featured a prescient bit of graffiti. But ""the war"" could just as easily signify the cataclysm of 9/11 or even Giuliani’s seven years as mayor, during which time he fundamentally changed the city’s character. However, the New York of <i>Before the War</i> ultimately isn’t the real city itself, but something like a more literary creation. This is the New York of the Ramones and CBGBs, of Jonathan Lethem and Paul Auster, of <i>The Warriors</i> and <i>Taxi Driver</i>. Every guy on the corner is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14922-johnny-thunders/"">Johnny Thunders</a>, and every girl in a bar is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a> circa <i>Just Kids.</i></p>
<p>This is the New York of our collective imagination peopled with dreamers and artists, gutter saints and garage bands. It’s also a city perpetually in the process of disappearing. ""Now they’re closing down the book store, and they’re putting up a condo,"" he sings on ""Addicted"", which percolates with the kind of jittery energy anyone who’s set foot in Manhattan will recognize. When he sings the line, ""I’ve lived here all my life,"" it sounds like a very specific kind of introspection, not unlike that of a subway rider studiously avoiding eye contact with anyone else in the car.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest thing about this imagined New York is its diversity. Malin doesn’t get into loft jazz or Bronx salsa, but <i>Before the War</i> covers a lot of ground within the confines of rock-and-roll, ranging from the expected punk-derived rave-ups to barstool ballads to heart-on-sleeve country. He not only makes these disparate styles fit together naturalistically, but also allows them to comment on the album’s overarching narrative. The opener, which is actually called ""The Dreamers"", manufactures suspense via a progression of cinematically ominous piano chords, which are only dampened somewhat by the awkward refrain: ""Every time I hear the sound of my international baby."" ""Bar Life"" is a rousingly rueful drinking song about an immigrant whose dreams are preempted by alcoholism, and there’s something both reassuring and depressing about hearing so many people singing along to his downfall.</p>
<p>There is nothing new in Malin’s depiction of New York, and that may be the whole point: He wants this milieu to be instantly familiar. He wants you to connect Sheena with the Ramones, he wants you to hear echoes of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2052-richard-hell/"">Voidoids</a> in ""Freeway"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"">Television</a> in ""Boots of Immigration"". So many local references may be tedious for listeners who already suffer from New York fatigue or who don’t think you have to move to Brooklyn to start a band. While Malin makes the nostalgia generally relatable, he doesn’t evoke the setting with much specificity or detail. In fact, it’s hard to shake the notion that he is merely taking part in the city’s ongoing romanticization of its own gloriously seedy culture and history, which has been the local pastime since before Sheena copped an attitude.</p></div>"|20369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20369-new-york-before-the-war/|6.7|Stephen M.

His discography is overshadowed by the names he has worked with—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2475-jamie-lidell/"">Jamie Lidell</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>, and many musicians from Canada's indie and electro circles, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3271-peaches/"">Peaches</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"">Feist </a>(he was a key contributor to the Grammy-nominated <i>The Reminder</i>). It's more likely that you own several albums with his name in the credits than one with his name on the cover.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that he's changed his name and style several times. Gonzales' influences encompass classical, jazz, rap, chill-out music and easy-listening pop, and he continually reshuffles them to emphasize one strand or another. Before the '90s were out, he quit the Warner Bros.-signed Canadian alt-rock band Son, moved to Berlin and started releasing keyboard-driven coffeehouse electro under the apocryphal surname Gonzales. Then he came back in the '00s as Chilly Gonzales, a pop-classical songwriter and pianist with a sideline in '70s radio pastiches (see the album <i>Soft Power</i>).</p>
<p>In chamber music, he found something like a solid niche. Gonzales' neo-Romantic mode has been his most productive in recent years, with the second of two <i>Solo Piano</i> albums being longlisted for the Polaris Prize. He returns to it on <i>Chambers</i>, a modest, plush song cycle with the new addition of string arrangements performed by Hamburg's capable Kaiser Quartett. The configuration allows Gonzales to build out his Satie-like compositions into homages to other composers from classical music history.</p>
<p>But <i>Chambers</i> should not be mistaken for the kind of contemporary classical coming out of Naxos, ECM or New Amsterdam. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29319-victoire/"">Victoire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"">Nico Muhly</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8718-valgeir-sigursson/""><span>Valgeir Sigurðsson</span></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30072-ymusic/"">yMusic</a>, for instance, all sound downright recondite next to Gonzales. He is more interested in where the form has been, and, as he tells us in liner notes and a <a href=""https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/musical-genius-chilly-gonzales-explains-the-history-of-pop-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vice op-ed</a>, in making us hear it as Schubert was heard in his day—as pop. With Impressionist and minimalist diversions, he plies an extroverted row that ends in the Romantic era, untroubled by dissonance, alternate tonality or complex time. It's as if Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Varèse never happened.</p>
<p>Gonzales has a soft, precise touch on the piano, tastefully decorating nimble progressions with expressive spills through nearby scales. As an admittedly novice string arranger, he favors ranks of staccato pulses and gently fencing legato lines, splicing them effectively on ""Advantage Points"". On ""Prelude to a Feud"", cascading piano arpeggios inspired by Bach and electronic dance music break out into a Tchaikovsky-like courtly dance. ""Cello Gonzales"" fashions the instrument of the title, with its plaintive vocal quality, into a Mendelssohn tribute. ""Sweet Burden"" channels dreamy, pensive French Impressionists; the lush, broad eddies of ""Green Leaves"" summon Vivaldi; ""Solitaire"" and others pine for Schubert.</p>
<p>Gonzales makes some valid claims for the album's pop aspects—""Sample This"" purports to transmute a Southern rap bounce track, while ""Switchcraft"" is modeled on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a>'s asymmetrical flow. You can hear it if you try, but it's unlikely that a casual listener will perceive these as bangers. Gonzales' limited interest in forms and textures beyond pristine, overt beauty level the record out toward soundtrack music, consistent with crowd-pleasers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27990-peter-broderick/"">Peter Broderick</a>, without many layers to peel back over time. Though enjoyable, it may land in a limbo, too simplistic for fans of great chamber music or its challenging modern variants; too classical—lacking bells, whistles, samples and beats—to make it more than pleasant dinner party music for people coming from the indie side.</p></div>"|20376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20376-gonzales-chambers/|6.2|Brian Howe

<p>In rap music, the album has become a hurdle. You can count on one hand the rappers who can accomplish the following two feats: getting a label to release an album, and having that album be good enough that fans aren’t imagining the ways in which it could have been more like the artist’s previous—usually more unfettered and pure—work. In the increasingly fraught journey from underground to mainstream, no time is more uncertain than when mixtapes and EPs must finally become an album. You get one or maybe two shots to prove your staying—and earning—power before your resources get shifted to the next dude with a few radio hits or a small but growing fanbase. It is a grim and unfair reality, and on his major label debut album <i>Mr. Wonderful</i>, Queens jester Action Bronson more or less flips his middle finger at it—an admirable response, though ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Consider that the first time we hear Bronson’s voice, he is singing in an exaggerated off-key warble. The song falls apart twice, with Bronson cursing that he can't get his vocals right. The moment feels like a rejection of the idea that a major-label debut needs to be a no-nonsense statement to be remembered for decades. In theory, this approach would be refreshing, and if any rapper could let the attendant album pressure roll right off his back, it’s Bronson, who inhabits a character whose reality bares little resemblance to his—or our—own. Yet those atonal vocals end up feeling like a warning sign that Bronson is not going to upend the way rappers make their debut albums. Instead, it turns out, he’s just going to derail his own.</p>
<p>Those nagging vocals—the kind of singing you do to momentarily piss off your significant other—not only embody the spirit of the album, but they conveniently highlight exactly when and where <i>Mr. Wonderful</i> falls apart. After an opening handful of tracks that sound reliably like Action Bronson songs—with a few noticeably ritzy, retro-soul productions—the album shifts into a suite introduced by ""THUG LOVE STORY 2017 THE MUSICAL (Interlude)"", a sketch in which an older man sings to Bronson about a lost love who disappeared from the streets.</p>
<p>What follows is a musical of sorts wedged into the gut of the album, with Bronson continuing the story of a runaway girl who has left the protagonist brokenhearted. On ""City Boy Blues"", Bronson fashions himself as a bluesman, singing and mumbling over a jazz-bar instrumental. Next is ""A Light in the Addict"", a maudlin and forgettable song made with longtime collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30321-party-supplies/"">Party Supplies</a> that features an unnecessary multiple-minute piano outro. It’s all wrapped up by ""Baby Blue"", in which Bronson kisses the woman off with those same whining vocals, over a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5304-mark-ronson/"">Mark Ronson</a> production that could have fit on an Amy Winehouse album.</p>
<p>This digression is conceptually ambitious, but the execution seems to purposefully undercut the exercise, as if the suite was the result of an argument between a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other about what the album should accomplish that was won by neither. When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a> shows up at the end of ""Baby Blue"" with a verse of playfully inconsequential insults—""I hope every soda you drink already shaken up,"" ""I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck""—before admitting he hopes his heartbreaker is still happy, he pulls off in half a minute what Bronson couldn’t in fifteen: using an imagined story to reveal humanity through humor.</p>
<p>Bronson, it should be noted, has hit that note before. ""THUG LOVE STORY 2017 THE MUSICAL (Interlude)"" is a callback to ""Thug Love Story 2012"", a standout from his still-excellent mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16425-action-bronson-blue-chips/""><i>Blue Chips</i></a>. That song was connected to the multi-character track ""Hookers at the Point"", inspired by the HBO documentary of the same name, in which Bronson rapped in different voices from the points of view of a pimp, prostitute and john, in the process showing that he could consider and illuminate the world outside of his own head. Those two songs felt almost effortless in their construction, while the suite inside <i>Mr. Wonderful</i> feels at once belabored and half-assed.</p>
<p>From there, the album closes with a whimper. Party Supplies, Bronson’s most reliable partner, is brought back again on ""Only in America"", a track with a classic-rock guitar riff that feels like an inadequate sequel to the duo’s fantastic jukebox rap trifle ""Contemporary Man"". A few tracks later, there is a live recording of a meandering new song called ""The Passage""—if you can figure out the purpose of its inclusion you will have gotten further than me.</p>
<p>Amidst all this are a few tracks—""Terry"", ""Actin Crazy"", ""Galactic Love""—featuring Bronson spitting fantastical bullshit over laidback beats. This is where he is at his most natural, approachable, and likeable, dotting his world-traveling fantasies with the names of gourmet foods. Instead of slicing at convention, Bronson accepts it—bringing himself back to square one, which <i>Mr. Wonderful</i> argues, was a pretty fine place after all.</p>

It was a dramatic way of wiping the slate clean, of marking a line between ""then"" and ""now."" Previously, he had been known as one of the standard-bearers for the <a href=""http://nightslugs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night Slugs</a> label and its concussive club sound, and his 2012 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16768-classical-curves/""><i>Classical Curves</i></a> is widely regarded as one of the label's high points.</p>
<p>The songs he performed at Unsound bore little in common with his previous material, though, and neither does <i>Dream a Garden</i>, where jangly guitar licks and reverberant synthesizer predominate, and where half the tracks feature Latham's own earnest, high-pitched vocals. The album swims in reverb, phaser, tremolo, panning, and distortion. Where <i>Classical Curves</i> was slick and brittle, equal parts techno and grime, <i>Dream a Garden</i> is sticky and humid; where <i>Classical Curves</i> seemed streaked with graphite, <i>Dream a Garden</i> buckles like moldy carpet.</p>
<p>Latham assembles this sound from a mossy patchwork that proves hard to source: The watery keyboards often recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>, or a more moth-eaten <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>. The guitars—notes bent, signal clean—often evoke funk, or at least an idea of it. In ""Proud"", the wah-wah hints at <i>Hot Buttered Soul</i>; in ""The Garden Thrives"", the tone and strumming style recalls Prince's ""Sexy Dancer"".</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, this sound is all him. To Latham's credit, there's really nothing else out there that sounds like it. The newness of it is exciting, and so is the fullness of his vision; between the narcotic mood and the omnipresent murk, <i>Dream a Garden</i> suggests a maze-like expanse within its borders, perfect for getting lost in. Unfortunately, the album only partly lives up to those promises. The songwriting isn't quite there, for one thing. Chord changes meander, or get tripped up on a single leaden pedal tone. The same elements crop up again and again, and the layers of effects and detuned keyboards eventually turn oppressive; the album isn't much more than a half-hour long, but by the end it feels like chugging eggnog on a summer's day.</p>
<p>And Latham's voice frequently sounds thin and strained, perpetually aiming for notes that are just beyond his reach. He tends to bury it deep in the mix, too, so that it's almost impossible to decipher what he's actually singing. (The lone line I could pick out, from ""Today"": ""And not so long ago/ I was a child with a computer."") ""This is a record about love and resistance,"" declared the press release for the album, and in <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/17459-jam-city-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> he has stressed the necessity of finding ""different emotional avenues of political expression."" Those might be his goals, but sometimes it's not enough to just <i>dream</i> a garden; to get it to actually bear fruit takes planning and hard work, and to have planted in more fertile soil than he has chosen here. </p></div>"|20295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20295-dream-a-garden/|6.5|Philip Sherburne

In just the last handful of years, we’ve seen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> take the mantle and inspire a school of hoarse, melody-driven imitators, only to be phased out by adlib-happy hit machines like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos"">Migos</a>, yawping innovators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>, and precocious party-starters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32655-rae-sremmurd/"">Rae Sremmurd</a>. There’s a loose formula: Get acquainted with local hit-making producers like Zaytoven, Metro Boomin, the 808 Mafia crew; get a hit on the strip club circuit and local airwaves; collaborate extensively and pump out free projects hosted by the mixtape DJ of favor; maybe sign a 360 deal. The formula works, and has pumped out a lot of great, occasionally cutting-edge rap music.</p>
<p>But it’s not the only way to find success in Atlanta, as Awful Records’ kingpin Father has proved. His effortless-sounding, maddeningly catchy single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF9kOkRCnyo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Look at Wrist""</a> exploded on to the scene last summer, turning dancefloors into <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zN6mEQ8m9A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cooking dance</a> mosh pits nationwide without so much as a DJ Holiday drop. Along with peers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"">iLoveMakonnen</a> and Key! (conveniently, the single’s two featured artists), he’s part of the latest iteration of ""New Atlanta,"" broadly characterized for their DIY ethos and rough-around-the-edges minimalism. And while Makonnen quickly became the scene’s most visible constituent, Father’s been proving himself as its most consistent member. <i>Who’s Gonna Get Fucked First?</i>, a 12-song blast that dropped unannounced last week, is his strongest project yet, and a flag planted firmly in the soil of rap’s current epicenter. He reminds us that with good ideas and confidence in your own vision, you don’t need to play by any rules but your own.</p>
<p>""Look at Wrist"", the song that put Awful on the map, came with a hilarious subtext that almost didn’t register because of its hypnotizing repetition. ""Never had to whip a brick, but I get the gist"" felt like meta-commentary on middle American rap fans’ investment in trap lingo with a total remove from the lifestyle. Father wasn’t moralizing—we’re all just trying to have fun here—but this wry, knowing wink consistently informs his work, even in the midst of the turn-up. This is music that’s deceptively simple, that’s deeper than it lets on.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The SoundCloud description of <i>Who’s Gonna Get Fucked First? </i>states its intent plainly: ""32-mins of pure, unfiltered debauchery."" This is party music about girls and drugs and fights, over efficient beats with lots of empty space. The unprintable title might give some initial pause, but it fits. Even more than partying, this is an album about sex—weird, freaky, intoxicated, potentially group sex—but also, consensual, mutually pleasurable, and age-appropriate. Father handles the topic with a maturity and egalitarianism that feels revelatory, resulting in the most sex-positive rap release of the year. On ""Vamp"", in the midst of frothing come-ons, Father reminds his paramour, ""You have a right to all your choices."" ""Morena"", featuring Awful members Stalin Majesty and Abra, riffs on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rhf5n27BGc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Big Pun and Joe</span></a> in an adoring homage to women of color. (Elsewhere, Abra—one of Awful’s two female members—steals the show on bratty, hater-baiting flex ""Gurl"".) And on album highlight ""BET Uncut"", Richposlim delivers a strong candidate for best guest verse of 2015, clowning slut-shaming men into submission: ""I say she’s sexually liberated! You call her ass a ho."" It’s one of many sharp insights hidden in plain sight amid the Henny-guzzling and pill-popping.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Where so much<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/""> Atlanta rap</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/661-can-og-maco-be-more-than-a-one-hit-wonder/"">the last half decade</a> has been indebted to crunk, Father seems more inspired by snap music, the subgenre that tore up mid-2000s parties with ringtone-friendly 808s, finger-snaps, and raucous dance instructionals. The sound requires a rare sort of magnetism, one that can command a room without seeming to try, a quality Father has in spades. Jermaine Dupri’s label So So Def also looms over the project, and Father even references So So Def one-hit wonder <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwXeN2FsE7w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">J Kwon</a> on bow-throwing, drink-sloshing two-minute cut ""Everybody in the Club Gettin Shot"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But Father’s primary influence isn’t from Atlanta (or, arguably, from this plane of existence) at all: He has always shown a clear debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>, less in sound than in based spirit. He nods to him directly on grimy cut ""Read Her Lips"", one of three KeithCharles Spacebar-produced tracks here, with the hook: ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m5CIcbytfM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>First I go on tour,</span></a> then I fuck my bitch."" But the album’s basedness—its oddly memorable turns of phrase, sincere devotion to the absurd and mundane, and purposefully sketchy, homemade quality—feels like a logical extension of a brain raised on bugged-out cartoons, anime, and the infinite rabbit hole of the Internet. Father was a visual artist before coming around to rap, and has <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2014/09/father-young-hot-ebony-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>cited</span></a> a childhood fascination with ""Rocko's Modern Life"" and other '90s cartoons informed by acid trips and dirty jokes—stuff with a visceral appeal for children, but a snarky, debauched subtext for adults. It’s the same ethos that turns even the most seemingly straightforward Father tracks slightly askew.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-80fdba1e-4812-f777-91e1-bac2cb4a54c0""><span>With the exception of the KeithCharles Spacebar contributions, Father handles the production of the album himself. His style is aggressively minimal, leaving him room to experiment with rhythm and timing to better effect. It’s the ideal canvas for lines that embed themselves into your subconscious for days, the stuff you catch yourself mumbling into the mirror while brushing the Henny aftertaste off your teeth. And Father’s wry, casual lyricism is sharp and often loaded with insights, capable of doing a lot with a little. On the excellent ""Back in the ""A"" Freestyle/On It"", Father sets a hilarious scene with just three simple lines: ""Run up on me, leave you looking like Eddie Winslow/ In that episode when he got his ass beat/ Take my niggas, then cash out at the Zaxby’s."" He then insists on buying lunch for the whole squad. Friends, fights, and fast food: It might not be what you’ve come to expect from the hallowed grounds of ""New Atlanta,"" but Father’s never played by those rules anyway.</span></span></p></div>"|20413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20413-whos-gonna-get-fucked-first/|7.7|Meaghan Garvey

They seemed to be equals exchanging wisdom, Margaux says, except suddenly she realized they weren’t; she was starting to become more like<i> him</i>. ""He’s just another man who wants to teach me something,"" Margaux says dismissively.</p>
<p>A variation of this same line appears in the chorus of Chastity Belt’s ""Drone"", the opening track on their second album <i>Time to Go Home</i>. It’s a song about the illusion of freedom and respect within a relationship, its context vague but the sentiment arguably universal. ""I never expect much from anyone,"" Julia Shapiro sings. ""So I’m never disappointed and I never have to trust.""</p>
<p>The past few years have borne witness to a tidal wave of young, female fuck-ups in pop culture. The women who get too drunk on the dance floor, who date men who are bad for them, who don’t have their shit together <i>and</i> are unapologetic about it, are everywhere, from ""Girls"" to <i>Frances Ha</i> to<i> How Should A Person Be?</i> And Chastity Belt, who preached the joys of fucking boys on the dancefloor and shouted ""Pussy Weed Beer"" on their last album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18426-chastity-belt-no-regrets/""><i>No Regerts</i></a>, may as well claim this title too.</p>
<p>But there’s a sadness to <i>Time to Go Home</i> beneath the drunken mayhem, one that leads to serious self-reflection and earnest inquiries about being a functioning human. Where the band once crooned jokingly about healthy punk lifestyles, pretentious tattoos and nip-slips, now they chew away at existential questions. Throughout the record they work through the hurt they’ve accrued, Shapiro singing over twangy electric lines about the lies she’s fed herself, her desire to just skip out on her own thoughts sometimes, and how she envies anyone who just feels alright. ""What is real?"" guitarist Lydia Lund sings on the gorgeous track ""Lydia"" before answering herself: ""It’s what you feel."" Even a song like ""Cool Slut"", a proud endorsement of sleeping around that would have felt fun and confident on their previous record, feels laden with a layer of doubt here.</p>
<p>Chastity Belt haven't traded their raucous party-girl ways for slow-paced sob stories; ""Why Try"" and ""Trapped"" are both shimmy-worthy surf rock jams and ""The Thing"" is a certified head-banger, a screaming ode to the John Carpenter horror flick of the same name. But you can hear them peering down upon their worries with a drearier set of beer goggles than before. <i>Time to Go Home</i> is a beautifully composed record about confronting your fuck-ups, but it’s also a record about feeling numb to them. And with every hit they seem to take to the heart and head, Chastity Belt proves that sometimes the best response is a big shrug of indifference.</p></div>"|20310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20310-time-to-go-home/|7.6|Hazel Cills

Which is to say that the Cribs are usually the least renowned people in the studio on any given Cribs album. The Jarman brothers can claim another hall-of-famer as alumnus after <i>For All My Sisters</i>, as they put power-pop patron saint <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3130-ric-ocasek"">Ric Ocasek</a> behind the boards for their sixth LP.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While Ocasek’s post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/690-the-cars"">Cars</a> C.V. includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6501-no-doubt"">No Doubt</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices"">Guided by Voices</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/275-bad-brains"">Bad Brains</a>, as a producer, he will forever be tied to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>’s <i>Blue Album<span>—</span></i>it’s an association so strong that Weezer themselves have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8611-weezer-green-album/"">used</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19830-weezer-everything-will-be-alright-in-the-end/"">it </a><i>twice</i> to signify a return to form. And without any context, you’d think the Cribs were Ocasek’s impressionable and adroit young charges. ""Finally Free"" and ""Pacific Time"" are structured like early Weezer songs<span>—</span>midtempo, in 6/8 time, with adenoidal, agitated verses leading up to a falsetto whoop in the chorus. Or, check the thin, rigid synth-lines that creep through ""Mr. Wrong"", and the guitars EQ’d to sound like synths on ""An Ivory Hand"". Then again, the Cribs’ loose-limbed playing and occasionally misanthropic tendencies are more spiritually in line with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal""><i>Pinkerton</i></a>—the pansexual frustration expressed on ""Diamond Girl"" gets a bit close to ""Pink Triangle"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Maybe Ocasek provides more of a sheen than Fridmann and Albini did on 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16567-the-cribs-in-the-belly-of-the-brazen-bull""><i>In the Belly of the Brazen Bull</i></a>, but either removing and adding an extra coat of gloss is basically all a producer can provide the Cribs at this point. Thought they still land on magazine covers in their native UK, the band has more of a unique role than a unique sound—<i>For All My Sisters</i> is a scruffy, buzzy and very hooky guitar album that doesn’t quite scan as ""punk"" or ""indie"". Which is to say it sounds like the '90s and really could’ve used MTV’s captive audience. It's easy to imagine this sort of thing finding favor with American Anglophiles back when they actually bought CD’s—perhaps an equivalent to a latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4000-supergrass"">Supergrass</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/143-ash"">Ash</a>.</p>
<p>But then there are moments when the Cribs honor their reputation for prickliness. At multiple points, they snipe at their <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/17/florence-and-the-machine-indie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">landfill indie</a> peers, albeit with more subtlety than <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QpkuxPJ-8A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hey Scenesters""</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13709-ignore-the-ignorant""><i>Ignore the Ignorant</i></a> or telling the NME that the <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/glastonbury/29197"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""mainstream attitude of indie bands today is a bigger problem than global warming""</a>. When Ryan Jarman sings, ""We’re not as straight as they want us to be"" during ""Diamond Girl"", you might hear ""they"" as the extremely straight white male likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32495-royal-blood"">Royal Blood</a> and Catfish and the Bottlemen currently reigning over nominal UK indie. An even sharper jab is audible on ""Burning for No One"": the line, ""Dancing on the screen/ I still see you as the star power you used to have,"" sorta <i>has</i> to be about Jarman’s ex <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5426-kate-nash/"">Kate Nash</a>.</p>
<p>It's likely that any chest-puffing here (""Finally Free"", ""Mr. Wrong"") is meant to compensate for  a broken heart. After all, ""Burning for No One"" is meant as a sort of human torch song, the title taken from Jarman likening himself to ""a candle on a vacant table/ Being so denied."" Besides, it’s hard to take <i>For All My Sisters</i> as an act of sincere aggression when the Cribs have called it a supposed companion piece with a rawer, <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/the-cribs/82886"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more trad-punk record they recorded with Steve Albini</a>. Of course, the last time they recorded with Albini, the result was <i>In the Belly of the Brazen Bull</i>, an album that wasn’t all too different than this one. So it remains to be seen if that’s just another example of the Cribs’ taste for modest interior decoration or whether they can really pull down the structure.</p></div>"|20287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20287-for-all-my-sisters/|6.7|Ian Cohen

Doris</i> is cool, but you can hear the doubt in my voice."" The remark played into the narrative surrounding the album: that it was a document of re-acclimating to the world after <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/complex-exclusive-we-found-earl-sweatshirt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a year lost to boarding school</a>, of trying to figure out (amongst a sudden rush of newfound attention and worldly temptations) what kind of music the still-teenage rapper was really interested in making. Nonetheless, ""doubt"" seemed a curious way of describing the actual music on <i>Doris</i>. Earl exhibits a stunning level of technical and tonal control on that album;<b> </b>if <i>Doris</i>, in all its brazenness and complexity, was Earl feeling timid, what would the opposite sound like?</p>
<p>His latest album, <i>I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside,</i> suggests an answer. From the first bars of the swaggering organ-driven opener ""Huey"", it feels like the realization of a voice that, in some sense, he's had an APB out on since his first record: one that is both fluid and all angles, vacillating between naked introspection and pushing us as far away as possible. He sounds deadly serious and self-effacing at the same time, and his rocky, withdrawn psychology is more visible, and easier to trace, than ever. </p>
<p>Increasingly Earl is doing more with less, to an extent that might surprise many fans. He streamlines his verses radically, sometimes rapping at half his average speed on <i>Doris</i>. <i>I Don’t Like Shit</i> will come as a letdown to those who valued his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"">DOOM</a>-esque free association or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>-esque title-fight motor-mouthing, but he's lethally effective, absorbing whole styles for a verse's time as they seem to fit him. He strikes cocky, familiar poses in inventive ways (""Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me/ 50s in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth,"" ""Niggas, my team is magicians/ We think of the shit that we want then we get it""). ""DNA"" finds him insult-rapping in stop-and-start and triplet flows straight from Kevin Gates and Lil Herb. <span>He never sounds like he's experimenting or even switching hats<span>—</span>just finding the mode of communication that best fits his thought or mood.</span></p>
<p>The album’s aesthetic is still based in the ambling beats, messy synth counterpoint and off-jazz chording to which <a href=""http://www.oddfuture.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> releases usually defer. But Earl, who produces every track except Left Brain's ""Off Top"", dims the light to near-darkness. Melodies are oblique or hardly there, with keyboard leads diced up and strewn across tracks in fragments; drumbeats are tuned down and fuzzed out halfway into oblivion. The lead single ""Grief"" is perhaps the most interesting piece of production on the record—set back in a haze of post-industrial smog, it wheezes along like a broken piece of rusty machinery. The sound resembles the murky and glitch-ridden ""alternative trap"" of Chicago rapper <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/boob7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lucki Eck$</a>, a recent collaborator of (stylistically like-minded) R&amp;B artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>.</p>
<p>While other OF artists struggle to avoid self-parody or anonymity, Earl is carefully whittling away at the proclivities he's always had, remaining confident that he’ll light upon something that feels fresh and honest. So far, he's right. He’s making music that never gets ahead of itself, or what he needs to communicate: the way he processes the outside world (on an example-by-example basis) and why and how he runs away from the things he runs away from. <i>EARL</i>’s precocious kid who said things you couldn’t believe he was saying, or <i>Doris</i>’ prodigal teen who had insights beyond his years, both feel distant. With nothing to prove and no longer an upstart, Earl sounds, more than ever, simply like himself.</p></div>"|20422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20422-i-dont-like-shit-i-dont-go-outside/|8.0|Winston Cook-Wilson

After that group dissolved some years back, Whispers adopted his childhood nickname—he was a soft-spoken kid—for his solo work. His keyboard demos attracted the attention of fellow lo-fi eccentric <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>, who invited him to open a few of his shows. Whispers may have appeared as a kindred spirit to Pink, but the Midwestern songwriter approaches his work with far less theatricality and chaos than the volatile L.A. figure. His quick, sweet debut <i>Summer in Pain</i> is pared down to the basics, spelling out heartbreak and frustration with a tried-and-true palette of organs, drum machines, and a world-weary tremble. </p>
<p>While Pink at times seems almost unconscious of the labels people apply to his work, Whispers breaks out the B-word within his album's first 30 seconds. He introduces himself as ""the greatest bedroom popper...in the tri-state area"" before he sings a note. Later in the record, he punctuates songs with interludes in the same register, decrying how he feels like a lost soul in a pre-apocalyptic world. I think he's trying to humanize himself with these gestures, to point out the absurdity of making bedroom pop about his feelings before he goes and does it anyway. But to crack open the fourth wall before he's even built it comes through as a little self-conscious, a little insecure.<br/><br/> Those bedroom pop songs about his feelings, though, are worth the corny showmanship that pads them. Like Owen Ashworth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30302-advance-base/"">Advance Base</a> (formerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/698-casiotone-for-the-painfully-alone/"">Casiotone for the Painfully Alone</a>), Whispers can wring heart from a cheap set of keys. The album's middle section shows off his skill at crafting grooves and melodies; ""Heart Don't Know"" strikes a sugar-coated melancholy with its warm chords churning underneath Whispers' ragged voice. On ""Pain in Love"", he laments, ""I wanna change the way I feel tonight/ I wanna love again."" He writes rudimentary lines, but sometimes the best way to undercut depression and desire is just to spell them out in the plainest terms. Sometimes all you need to feel better is just to ask for it.<br/> <br/> ""Love is easy when you don't give a shit,"" Whispers advises on ""Michael, Don't Cry"". ""Life is easy when you want to die."" The only conclusions he manages to reach on <i>Summer in Pain</i> contradict themselves, but they're the best indication of where his head's at. Here's a guy trying to claw his way out of a tangled emotional state by pretending he's surrounded by clean lines. It works when he sticks to the music. The spoken-word framing screams ""look at me, I'm here, I exist"", when the songs are enough to convince us in the first place.</p></div>"|20378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20378-summer-in-pain/|6.4|Sasha Geffen

But for Spencer, indecency and sincerity were the same thing, fuelled by a devout belief in the sort of primal, provocative, persona-driven rock'n'roll embodied by everyone from Little Richard to Iggy Pop to James Chance. The Blues Explosion name was an both an assertion of tradition and an act of treason, reconnecting '90s post-hardcore indie rock with a history it had disowned, trolling blues purists who assumed the band was mocking the form, all while pissing off their own garage-punk base by importing </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90iaLaPMa9g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>raps from Beck</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhOPB2rKk80"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>beats from Dan the Automator</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Alas, since regrouping after a six-year hiatus in 2010, the Blues Explosion now exist in a world where the context that made their past work so outrageous has all but evaporated, while even a horndog come-on like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9mkVE9dN1s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""baby, baby, you sure like to fuck""</span></a><span> seems downright chivalrous at a time when pick-up lines have been replaced by Snapchat dick pics. The Blues Explosion are fully aware that their moment has passed—that line quoted at the top of this review leads off a song called ""Funeral"", which sets the thematic tone for a record that essentially functions as the Blues Explosion’s answer to </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/608-to-the-5-boroughs/"">To the 5 Boroughs</a></i><span>. </span><i>Freedom Tower-No Wave Dance Party 2015</i><span> is a eulogy for the seedy New York City where Spencer first earned his notoriety—amid the early-'80s triangulation of hardcore, rap, and the avant-garde—and an attempt to come to terms with the gentrified version that exists today. But it’s also an album that rarely forgets the first three letters of ""funeral"" are f-u-n.</span></p>
<p>Compared to 2012’s commendable if conventional comeback effort, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17056-meat-and-bone/"">Meat and Bone</a></i><span>, </span><i>Freedom Tower-No Wave Dance Party 2015</i><span> more easily locks into the singularly gritty groove the Blues Explosion patented circa 1994’s </span><i>Orange</i><span>. (""Funeral"" is pretty much </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90iaLaPMa9g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Flavor""</span></a><span> squeezed into a tapered set of </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZmxNM6DwsY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Bellbottoms""</span></a><span>, and destined to usurp the latter as the band’s entrance theme of choice.) And if the </span><span>No Wave</span><span> in the album title is a bit of a misnomer—this ode to NYC is more </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11816-run-dmc-king-of-rock-raising-hell-tougher-than-leather/""><span>DMC</span></a><span> than </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2568-dna-on-dna/""><span>DNA</span></a><span>—they at least get the </span><span>Dance Party</span><span>part right, with an infectiously upbeat energy that keeps that action moving at a brisk clip</span> (albeit without the speed-freak menace that once brought out their berserker best). But even if it mostly avoids the scratched-up boom-bap of the band’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcOKE2qHs9c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">past hip-hop nods</a>, <i>Freedom Tower</i> could very well be the band’s most overtly rap-inspired record to date—it’s just that, instead of absorbing the texture of hip-hop into the album’s production, they cop its cadence in the punky performances.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to detect the influence of early Chuck D on Spencer’s ""Wax Dummy"" spiel, while ""The Ballad of Joe Buck""—powered by Russell Simins’ thundering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dZbAFmnRVA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Halleluwah""</span></a><span>-sized beat—sees the frontman assume the nursery-rhyme flow of a circa-'79 block party MC. But these modes are natural fits for Spencer’s maniacal, motor-mouthed mojo, infused with a playfulness that undercuts the chest-beating posturing endemic to rap-rock. And as far as minimalist three-piece rock bands go, Spencer, Simins, and Judah Bauer are at their most intuitive when acting like cut-and-paste producers—they’re still less interested in songwriting than song-writhing, constantly contorting and distorting a track’s trajectory to maximize the endorphin rush. On frenzied, byzantine workouts like ""Born Bad"" and ""Dial Up Doll"", the Blues Explosion cycle through the history of rock'n'roll like one of those YouTube videos that </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOGukFBw_Hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>summarizes a season of </span><span>""Game of Thrones""</span><span> in two minutes</span></a><span>, stripping out stuff like character development and emotional arcs and stitching together only the most essential riffs, rhythms, and one-liners.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-d2f2b9d7-25f9-ec8c-c613-e4408ea1853a"">Spencer turns 50 this year, a factor that’s less audible in <i>Freedom Tower</i>’s spirited swagger than in the frothy dad-worthy humor that occasionally rises to the fore—like the proud Rufus Thomas-inspired ""world’s oldest teenager"" boast on the roadhouse funk of ""Do the Get Down"", or the urban-cowboy blues of ""Down and Out"", a light-hearted requiem for a modern-day, overpriced New York where even ""a million dollars ain’t gonna last you but one year."" And while <i>Freedom Tower</i> isn’t exactly a concept album, it can belabor the NYC-nostalgia angle: From the titular nod to Run-DMC’s breakthrough single to the CBGB shout-outs to the archival JSBX interview snippets, ""Tales of Old New York: Rock Box"" is practically a VH1 special in miniature. But the album’s backward-gazing perspective doesn’t detract from the fact that <i>Freedom Tower</i> contains some of the Blues Explosion’s most inspired, vital music since their mid-'90s peak. And in a world where brawnier but decidedly humorless blooze-belters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"">the Black Keys</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32495-royal-blood/"">Royal Blood</a> still fill arenas, the Blues Explosion’s cheeky, scrappy brand of rock'n'roll is still something to cherish in the here and now.</span></p></div>"|20243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20243-freedom-tower-no-wave-dance-party-2015/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Recorded in a cloud of echo and shrouded by the distortion endemic to lo-fi equipment, Ahmed’s pieces used to feel distant, transmitted from some faraway plane and warped en route. Though <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5msAopm8YY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black Midas</a><span style=""color: #008000;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5msAopm8YY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""</a>,</span> from his excellent 2005 debut, was a gorgeous duet for piano and guitar, the recording added enough ghostly essence for the result to imply witchcraft. At its core, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Y32JvkQ4o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stained Sky""</a>, from his 2012 debut for <a href=""http://immunerecordings.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Immune Recordings</a>, was a chugging power ballad, but with the chords overloading the microphone and Ahmed’s voice interred by static, it became otherworldly, less a hit than a haze. ""The term singer-songwriter generally conjures up negative connotations,"" <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/ilyas-ahmed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he once told Tiny Mix Tapes.</a> ""I do consider what I do to be songs for sure, although my definition of songs might be different than others’.""</p>
<p>Ahmed’s new album and second for Immune,<i> I Am All Your Own</i>, might shrink that divide. Many of these eight songs are some of his most lucid and communicative, pushing the tunes beyond their surrounding textures. During ""The Last Laugh"", he repeats a short, beautiful phrase on electric guitar and sings softly above it, his harmonies out of time in a way that recalls the narcotic phasing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>’s early records. Room noises and equipment hums populate the background. But at last, the song—a bittersweet ode to a dying relationship—feels central, not just a vestige of the process. ""All You Say"" is another big Ahmed ballad, with heavy, slow strums of a few easy themes. The music wobbles, as if the tape machine were unsteady, but Ahmed takes care to play softly enough for the rendering to remain clear. Even when an electric guitar roars in for the second half, Ahmed tucks it just beneath the vocals and acoustic, letting it accent and illustrate his emotional disappointment without overwhelming it.</p>
<p>The adjustment seems incremental for Ahmed, a matter of moving a few knobs and adjusting some microphones. But the effect is revelatory. Ahmed has often collaborated and toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>’s Liz Harris, and his shift here recalls the move Harris made for last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19820-grouper-ruins/""><i>Ruins</i></a>, stepping from beneath the din and drone to play plaintive confessionals at the piano. So it goes with <i>I Am All Your Own</i>: Ahmed’s voice has never seemed so approachable and assured.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the heartsickness of these songs was too profound to hide, Ahmed seems newly compelled to connect. For all of its intricacy, Ahmed’s music never felt vulnerable so much as exploratory. On <i>I Am All Your Own</i>, he seems to have experimented enough to know that his structures and sentiments are strong enough to support themselves. ""I Need to Fix My Body So I Can Light My Mind on Fire Again"" is a tender, frank lament about how our neuroses disrupt important relationships. Picking a 12-string and tapping a tambourine, his slight falsetto breaking just above the riff, he produces something like a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12bM1CqHoBY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toad the Wet Sprocket</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdYWuo9OFAw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goo Goo Dolls hit</a> from an alternate universe,<span> a place that Ahmed once seemed embarrassed to admit he even visited.</span></p>
<p><i>I Am All Your Own</i> does reduce the once-beguiling mystery of Ahmed’s music. What you hear with these numbers is mostly what you get, with surface noise and sonic mess to penetrate. Some may find that the new transparency makes his work a bit pedestrian, the work of another guy with a guitar and a few chords sharing simple sadness. But Ahmed’s senses of song and arrangement remain highly idiosyncratic, where verses spill into choruses and solos in unpredictable fashion. Listening back to Ahmed’s early work, that has always been the case, but he’s finally resolved to let us in on his secret.</p></div>"|20211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20211-i-am-all-your-own/|7.7|Grayson Haver Currin

From the raw garage krautrock of 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14212-deep-tissue/""><i>Deep Tissue</i></a> to the snarled wavelength scrambling of 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18203-people-of-the-north-sub-contra/""><i>Sub Contra</i></a>, People of the North is where organist Bobby Matador and drummer John Kid Millions—joined, frequently, by Oneida guitarist Shahin Motia—go to really let their hair down. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3782-sightings/"">Sightings</a> bassist Richard Hoffman sits in for <i>Era of Manifestation</i>, a dense suite of molten noise-jazz that suggests a deconstructed<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Corner"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> On the Corner</i></a> sans funk and horns. The title references a period in the mid-1800s when American Shakers experienced visions, visitations, and other mystical phenomena. Its namesake, the result of a five-hour jam session, can often feel wondrous in an apocalyptically tactile way, as if all the world’s elements were being set against one another at the same time. The almost arbitrary way most of these compositions end—as though some stone-faced neighbor suddenly took an ax to the power line—simultaneously bolsters and subverts the manic intensity of the music.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The extended, variegated drone that kicks off opener ""Grain Diagrams"" is a head-fake; soon the drums are slamming with purpose, and the organ chords are clawing up through the stratosphere. On frenetic, crispy ""The Whirling Gift"", the unit jitterbugs mercilessly, a no-wave Rube Goldberg machine. The shorter takes are no less visceral: consider ""Vise"", where a twitchy organ hiccup is sacrificed, inch by inch, to a widening, distorted black hole, or the apoplectic Taser bebop that characterizes ""Religion in Their Work"".</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s only on the title track that the quartet allows a bit of air—if not light—into its hermetically-sealed dome. A bristling, cacophonous groove explodes, then everything falls away, save right-channel distortion and a left-channel organ fugue. That stillness feels damning and isolated, but doesn’t last long, and the rest of ""Era of Manifestations"" is spent struggling to attempt to get back to its own speed. Unable to find traction, Millions pounds in futility, unfocused, while a frustrated Matador jabs and smothers his keys; every attempt to regain the previous velocity fails. A funny thing happens in the process: This venting creates a nervy, tug-of-war frisson that’s ultimately far more invigorating than what immediately preceded it. Like much of People of the North’s catalog, <i>Era of Manifestations</i> comes across as an attempt at extreme therapy; I secretly find myself hoping the band never quite finds the peace that its raging towards.</span></p></div>"|20284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20284-era-of-manifestations/|7.8|Raymond Cummings

Not that event seems to matter either way to Barnett, who shows up in her own songs like a bemused local taking questions from a camera crew that rushed to the scene in hopes of finding someone more interesting. ""I had goggles on,"" she notes in the swimmer song (""Aqua Profunda!""). ""They were getting foggy/ I much prefer swimming to jogging.""</p>
<p><i>Sit</i> is Barnett's first album, the follow-up to two EPs collected on a Barnettily-titled product called <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18641-courtney-barrett-the-double-lp-a-sea-of-split-peas/""><i>The Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas</i></a>. Its music is descended from 1990s grunge, descended in turn from '60s garage and psychedelia—the rocks to the balloons of Barnett's thoughts, which blow back and forth above the distorted guitars buoyed by gas we can't actually see. Without her words, the music would sit there; without the music, Barnett would drift away. Half the time, she doesn't even sing, but talks, slipping into melody mid-line as though she just remembered she was playing music.</p>
<p>A young writer with a working sense of humor and no apparent agenda, Barnett seems like a throwback to a simpler time—Simpler Times being less a period in history than a fictional place visited through fairytales, Buddhist anecdotes, and characters like Winnie the Pooh, whose creator, A. A. Milne, is sometimes credited with the line from which Barnett takes her record's name. An ease surrounds her music, a looseness: Even at their most clever, her songs glide from line to line and thought to thought, a stray observation about cracks in the walls leading to something about the wrinkles in Barnett's own palm, propelled by rock'n'roll that seems to find itself plenty serviceable but nothing to stop and fuss over. ""I just know what I know,"" she recently told <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/arts/music/courtney-barnett-prepares-her-debut-album.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The New York Times</i></a>; ""I think I'm shit some days, and some days I think I'm pretty good,"" she told <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/courtney-barnett-writes-all-the-best-songs/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grantland</a>. To paraphrase the composer and philosopher <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Cage"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a>, Barnett has nothing to prove and she's proving it.</p>
<p>Doting too seriously on <i>Sometimes I Sit</i> misses what I take to be Barnett's point: Life is but a dream, tra la la, whatever. Even the album's biggest moments grow from small places, like the washed-up seal corpse in ""Kim's Caravan"" that spins out into a meditation on mortality, pollution, what it means to be stewards to our environments and to ourselves—a mental crescendo matched by a band that keeps ebbing deeper into feedback. In the end, Barnett returns invariably to herself, a subject she finds hard enough to understand. </p>
<p>If all this seems a little heady in discussion, it's to the credit of Barnett and her band—Dave Mudie, Dan Luscombe, and Bones Sloane—that it doesn't sound that way on record. I don't know how things are in Barnett's Australia, but here in the U.S., A.D. 2015, she seems like an anomaly: A young songwriter who is smart but not intellectual, humble but not wimpy, into the past but not theatrical about it, aware of her feelings and aware of how too many feelings makes everyone bored.</p>
<p><i>Sometimes I Sit</i>'s most sentimental song is that house-hunting one. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17351-courtney-barrett-depreston/"">""Depreston""</a>, it's called—a quiet, countryish ballad that breaks up the noise around it. Barnett takes us into the neighborhood, into the house, into the sad little details that make her seem like a writery-writer: the picture of a young soldier, the safety rail in the shower. She mentions them once and doesn't linger because she knows there's no point—nothing she could add to the image would make it sadder than it is. Instead she slips into a refrain of how much it might cost to tear the house down and build a new one, which she repeats over and over again, until the memory of the shower is gone. A little life is plenty.</p></div>"|20268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20268-sometimes-i-sit-and-think-and-sometimes-i-just-sit/|8.6|Mike Powell

Instead, refracted guitars, neon keyboards, and muffled saxophones percolate around a padded house beat and a drum kit’s gentle kick. A half-dozen players rise steadily into a krautrock-like sprawl, their textures swirling around the constant thump. When at last Cabic arrives with a few lines about the disorienting effects of insomnia as the dawn breaks, he sounds small, diffident and unsettled, like he’s still finding his place within the very band he’s built. ""Out in the real world/ Confusion’s keeping score,"" he meekly offers in the first chorus. His voice fights to stay above the backing: ""Out in the real world/ Close calls and closing doors.""</p>
<p>The song, the sentiment and Cabic’s hesitation to lead both represent a one-tune summary not only of the vexing, indecisive <i>Complete Strangers</i> but also of Vetiver’s career of equivocal output. After the end of his primo North Carolina indie rock outfit the Raymond Brake in the late '90s, Cabic dispatched to San Francisco. Vetiver emerged there several years later as part of the young century’s wild freak-folk entourage. The group’s self-titled 2004 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8528-vetiver/"">debut</a> delivered a placid and promising collection of gentle ballads and eclectic exercises, making Cabic an easy counterpart for tourmates and collaborators <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"">Joanna Newsom</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"">Devendra Banhart</a>.</p>
<p>But for the next several years, members drifted in and out of Vetiver as the leader pulled sideman and production duties for a dozen others. Vetiver struggled for self-definition, seeking it in a set of cover records and several albums that only grew more unfocused. There were moments of folk-rock shamble and Laurel Canyon bliss, power-trio crunch, and New Wave languor, all linked by a thin thread of psychedelic pop wanderlust. <i>Complete Strangers</i>, which scans like the faceless mixtape of a J.Crew annual spring clearance sale, encapsulates that decade-long conundrum with 10 thin tracks.</p>
<p>Cabic tries on a variety of guises during <i>Complete Strangers</i>. With shimmering guitars and carousel keyboards, ""Loose Ends"" suggests the easy jangle of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds"">the Byrds</a> as recreated by power-pop champions <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3833-sloan/"">Sloan</a>. ""Time Flies"" flits through gentle tropicália, rhythms shuffling behind a guitar duet between Cabic and Banhart, who appears on his first Vetiver album since 2006. ""Current Carry"" laps in the same warm Pacific waters as Jack Johnson and John Butler, a bulbous bass line bouncing beneath syncopated acoustic strums and the lightest funk. ""Shadows Lane"" explores a reverberating melancholy that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/777-the-clientele/"">the Clientele</a>’s late, great records. Cabic’s croon floats like a whisper above a gentle drum trot and clouds of echo.</p>
<p>Supported by producer <a href=""http://jdmanagement.com/thommonahan/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thom Monahan</a>, who has remained a constant on all Vetiver albums, and a crack team of musicians familiar from many of those releases, Cabic delivers all of these looks competently. In particular, he sells ""Edgar"", a slow-burning ballad built for a miniature orchestra and the album’s best moment. And he sounds at ease with closer ""Last Hurrah"", a halcyon folk-rock number. He clearly <i>gets </i>all these forms he’s exploring. Too often, though, the songs sound like mere skeletons constructed from obvious and disconnected influences. After a spin or two, there’s no reason to revisit much of <i>Complete Strangers</i>, nothing left to discover aside from just how threadbare these tunes are. The richness of Cabic’s forebears eludes him, as though he’s too busy moving between styles to commit to any of them. He does a lot to highlight his predecessors’ work but very little to advance it.   </p>
<p>A vague feeling of regret lingers throughout much of <i>Complete Strangers</i>. Cabic announces his discontent with dreams during ""Confiding"" and his unease with the exigencies of everyday existence during ""Backwards Slowly"". He bemoans the fame of others at one point and decries the luck of other people’s big breaks during another. Never before has Vetiver’s presiding melancholy been so bitter, but it’s understandable, too. After six albums, Cabic has yet to build a discernible and discrete identity for this band. It remains the ongoing also-ran from a loose freak-folk confederation that’s splintered in a dozen surprising ways. ""I’m still figuring the album out,"" <a href=""http://www.highroadtouring.com/vetiver-announces-tour-in-support-of-complete-strangers-out-324/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cabic wrote in the note</a> that announced <i>Complete Strangers</i>. ""It feels like someone I’ve just met yet known for a long time."" That is an apt assessment of Vetiver’s discography at large, too—a catalog full of familiar shapes made by someone who has yet to figure out how to make them function as one. It’s as if, after a decade, Vetiver is waiting for Andy Cabic’s real voice to enter the mix at last.</p></div>"|20076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20076-complete-strangers/|4.9|Grayson Haver Currin

Team’s debut and not enough like it, unsure of whether to top </span><i>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</i><span> or move on.</span></div>
<p>On <i>The Scene Between, </i>Parton has gone back to his original method of composing, recording and producing all of the music himself, save for the vocals, which means he’s purposefully inviting comparisons to <i>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</i>.<i> </i>And yet, the results feel like his most truly songwriterly work yet. Without context, you’d think the Go! Team of <i>T</i><i>he Scene Between</i> were just a jubilant group of British indie pop enthusiasts emerging from their local DIY scene (the fact that they share their name with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn-N1ceo9cM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Calvin Johnson project</a> doesn't hurt).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His range as a composer, rather than an auteur or producer, has never been more evident. The minty fresh melodies of ""What D’You Say?"" and ""Did You Know?"" posit the Go! Team as having more in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"">Camera Obscura</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31949-alvvays"">Alvvays</a> than any crate-digger. On ""Her Last Wave"", they’re all of a sudden a dream-pop act. It’s all connected by Parton’s chunky drums and chaotic, buzzing production, roughage to the confectioner's pop.</p>
<p>But it’s a cohesive listen that doesn't quite translate into a cohesive statement of purpose. The presence of three interludes assumes the record is meant to be played in sequence, but the individually strong moments of <i>The Scene Between </i>never communicate with or build off each other enough. Considering it's bookended by its strongest tracks, <i>The Scene Between </i>might actually be a more satisfying listen on shuffle.

""I thought catchy melodies are the hardest thing to do in music,"" Parton admitted. Perhaps. The more important thing is to connect, and Parton believes the only way to do that is to make sure the power is never, ever off.</p></div>"|20252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20252-the-scene-between/|7.2|Ian Cohen

He is, in other words, starting his career at a time in life when most artists are winding theirs down. His debut, <i>Narcotic Lollipop</i>, arrived in 2002, followed up by the excellent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4367-bluefolk/"">bluefolk</a></i> in 2006, after which Jones took a hiatus of nearly a decade. On last year’s <i>Ancestor</i>, the spidery crawl of his guitar playing and the subdued croak of his vocals felt particularly compelling in the wake of so many dull revivalist bands mining the same Appalachian string-band history for inspiration. Perhaps due to his age and his experience—as an epileptic, as a nightclub owner, as a ballet dancer, carny, escape artist, lute player, thespian, father, and husband—Jones has a very distinct perspective on the joy of music and the burdens of life and death.</p>
<p>Throughout his brief musical career, Jones has refined a specific brand of minor-key Americana, rooted in the hills of his native Appalachia, in a way that casts him as an heir to a tradition rather than a student of history. To anyone who has heard any of his music, <i>Love &amp; Torture</i> will sound instantly familiar—almost to its disadvantage. Perhaps because it was recorded with the same personnel and approach, <i>Torture</i> picks up almost exactly where <i>Ancestor</i> left off. It has the same side-scrolling pace, the same dreamy texture of guitars, and even long-time friends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15516-patty-griffin/"">Patty Griffin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7059-kurt-wagner/"">Kurt Wagner</a> singing in the background. The album sounds less like a standalone collection and more like a sequel, as Jones seems to be settling into what has become his signature sound.</p>
<p>If many of the tracks on side one blend into one another, that may be due to Jones’ reliance on rigid song structures. He writes verses almost exclusively in couplets, and those pairings of rhyming lines lend the songs a similar lilt. <i>Love &amp; Torture</i> turns livelier when he breaks free of that stricture, when the rhymes aren’t quite so neat, when it grows more and more unhinged. Jones and producer Roger Moutenot loosen the later songs from their careful structure and allow more rust and static to develop. The delicate melody ""Ships"" emerges from an indecipherable fog noise, while ""Russia"" features an all-studio singalong of the ramshackle chorus: ""Meet me in Russia, we’ll have some vodka."" It’s a throwaway line, but Jones and his motley crew invest it with dark possibility. </p>
<p>The most affecting moments have a similar inexplicability: ""Song"" descends into a din of disembodied applause, and the 6-minute ""Who"" unravels into tangles of distortion and errant harmonica chords, as though Jones is carving these songs out of hard stone. By the time ""Say Amen"" intones its benedictions, <i>Love &amp; Torture</i> has come full circle, with Jones once again penning those familiar couplets and singing with what sounds like a newfound wisdom. It may tread the same rocky terrain, but it’s a journey worth taking.</p></div>"|20358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20358-love-torture/|6.8|Stephen M. Deusner

<p dir=""ltr"">Following a series of collaborative and solo efforts and the official end of Ghost after thirty years’ work, Batoh's new act, the Silence, is at once a continuation of the past and a break from it. One of Batoh’s longest-standing musical partners, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Kazuo Ogino, returns, while longtime <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12-acid-mothers-temple/"">Acid Mothers Temple</a> drummer Futoshi Okano is also on hand. Other members include baritone saxophonist Ryuichi Yoshida, veteran of Satoko Fujii Orchestra Tokyo and other jazz projects, and Jan Stigter, who also performs in the murkily beautiful duo Jan and Naomi. A familiar name is absent: Michio Kurihara, the remarkable guitarist whose participation in Ghost in the late 1990s and the previous decade elevated them to astonishing heights.</p>
<p>The central dynamic of Batoh and Ogino remains strong, which helps the Silence stand out clearly as its own project. The mood is calm, focused, and open-ended, as if the songs are meant to serve as springboards for live performances as much as a document of their final form. The stately piano and organ on ""Lemon Iro No Cannabis"" invoke classic rock without the rote tedium, and as flute, harmonica and more enter the arrangement, a sense of reclamation and transformation enters into the music. Batoh’s singing remains gently intense, as if he is half in rapture.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At this point, Batoh’s vision has the force of a life’s work backing it up. ""Götter Im Exil"", for instance, feels like one of Batoh’s most direct statements in song. ""Jewels in Tibet"" underscores his continuing strong interest in both Tibetan culture and politics, but the gentle Americana of the music recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"">the Band</a> as much as anyone. On ""Black Is the Colour of My True Love’s Hair"", the folk standard turned into a classic via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5062-nina-simone/"">Nina Simone</a> and covered innumerable times since, they demonstrate their continued interest in cultural recombination: Their version<b> </b>features a fluttering, engaging flute part that somehow feels both grave and genteel, while avoiding simply sounding like Ian Anderson. Immediately following that is a lively take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>’s ""Tango Whiskeyman"", one of the German legends' first songs with Japanese singer Damo Suzuki. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Silence are already recording a second album due for release later in the year, and the fact that the concluding cello-tinged track is called ""Overture"" further hints that there’s more to come. But the best prediction of the future may be the longest song on the album, the 8-minute instrumental ""Triptycon"". Nothing to do with Tom G. Warrior’s post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22778-celtic-frost/"">Celtic Frost</a> band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32169-triptykon/"">Triptykon</a> beyond the name, it consists of three parts that flow together into a lovely composition that feels like result of a good live jam. A little mysterious, suggesting mists on mountainsides and dark caverns, it’s not a sudden break from the past of Ghost but a clear sense that its core spirit continues into the future.</p></div>"|20374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20374-the-silence/|7.5|Ned Raggett

The record was a success, but Lewis seemed impatient with the smaller-scale stardom it brought, and made his hunger for bigger stages plain in interviews. On his 2012 follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16805-confess/""><i>Confess</i></a>, he upped the stakes, projecting in a booming, testosterone-rich voice over massive pop-rock tracks. It was a self-consciously spectacular pop record, and it solidified Lewis as someone eager to make Big Statements.</p>
<p>It’s easy to root for artists with this drive—the bedroom-to-stadium leap,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16844-gossamer/""> when it goes right</a>, is thrilling to witness, and major statements (and artists’ desires to make them) are a large part of what makes following music so worthwhile in the first place. The trouble with big leaps is that they can come with precipitous drop-offs, and on <i>Eclipse</i> Lewis plummets, hard, into a valley of deep ridiculousness.</p>
<p>Lewis’s influences have always felt rooted in '80s pop radio, when thundering drum machines and vocal overdubs stormed the Earth. On <i>Eclipse</i>, the sound edges into the twilight of '88, a moment when power ballads like Chicago’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uKLTtVqQpE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Look Away""</a> ruled the airwaves. The dewy piano of ""Alone"", coupled with Lewis’s echo-drenched vocal, summon unwelcome memories of Richard Marx’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E2EHVxNAE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Right Here Waiting""</a>. As he did with <i>Confess</i>, Lewis produces, and on <i>Eclipse</i> he pushes everything so far to the brink that it all tips over. The album sounds like the work of Ron Nevison, whose late-'80s work for Damn Yankees and Jefferson Starship set a new standard for what it meant to sound ""overblown.""</p>
<p>On <i>Confess</i>, Lewis gave us an outsized performance of masculinity that felt slippery, or at least self-aware, and a lot of that complexity lived in the dynamics. The choruses were massive, but the verses were taut and punchy, and the two worked in tandem. On <i>Eclipse</i>, that nuance is mostly erased, as is nearly any dynamic marking south of <i>ffffffff</i>. Most of the album is delivered in a triumphal shout. The chorus of ""To the Top"" punches the top of the mix so hard that there is almost nothing left to feel except stunned, and it carries a dangerous whiff of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYAAbbuEpnw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Diggler performing ""You’ve Got the Touch""</a>.</p>
<p>Lewis dials back the volume once or twice on <i>Eclipse</i>, and each time it’s a welcome reprieve. ""Old Love/New Love"" is a legitimately sexy, fluid dance-pop song, marked out with a side-chained four-to-the-floor pulse and house pianos. The big, blocky synths of ""When the Lights Turn Out"" are slightly reminiscent of '80s Jam &amp; Lewis, and Lewis’s voice is light and pretty above them. It might have a slight whiff of aerobicizing to it, but it’s sincere, and it’s possible, if you squint, to imagine it playing alongside One Direction (a huge compliment, in this case).</p>
<p>Playing next to One Direction is Lewis’s goal, and he is admirably focused and direct about it. ""I hate when people that are <i>definitely</i> in the indie world posture themselves as pop stars when they lack the ambition, practice, and craft of someone who is at the top of their game in pop,"" he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9575-twin-shadow/"">told</a> Pitchfork in January. His disdain is rooted in a competitive impulse to swim with the big fish—he has also submitted material for Chris Brown and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>—and <i>Eclipse</i>, which is also his first album on Warner Bros., is his bid to join them. But the music feels wedged between weight classes—too ridiculous to be indie rock and too ponderous and generic for Top 40 pop. Say this for <i>Eclipse</i>: It doesn’t miss by half measures.</p></div>"|20321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20321-eclipse/|4.9|Jayson Greene

It was accessible but strange, sweet but dark, and though it enlisted a wide range of collaborators, the vision was unmistakably Tinashe’s throughout. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Six months later, we are given <i>Amethyst</i>, a free, seven-track mixtape Tinashe recorded in her childhood bedroom over Christmas vacation. It’s a ""thank you"" gift to fans, she <a href=""https://twitter.com/Tinashe/status/577607195652665344"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>, but it’s also a reminder of where she came from. She may have <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXRnmOzgHog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">glo’d up</a> over the past year: she recently announced that instead of touring with Iggy Azalea this spring as planned, she’ll be joining the U.S. leg of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20058-nicki-minaj-the-pinkprint/""><i>Pinkprint</i></a> tour, to which the only valid response is <a href=""https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/577537019502444544"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""SWISH!!!""</a> But, as <i>Amethyst</i> implies, she’s still that girl messing with Pro Tools in her room in the dark, deeply invested in doing things her way.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In fact, </span><i>Amethyst</i><span>’s seven tracks are immediately more compelling than any of her pre-</span><i>Aquarius </i><span>tapes. Back then, circa 2012-13, the vision was there, and she was an expert at setting a mood, the listless, vaguely horny sort where you can’t decide whether sex or weed will put a dent in your late-night ennui. But like so much of the so-called ""alternative R&amp;B"" of its time, it lacked something central to great R&amp;B from all ages: in-the-flesh humanity, presence, something you can </span><span>feel</span><span> instead of just a tantalizing silhouette or ghostly caress.</span></p>
<p>But there is unambiguous groove here on <i>Amethyst</i>. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30667-ryan-hemsworth/"">Ryan Hemsworth</a> production ""Wrong"" meanders for a bit, then snaps into Tinashe’s funkiest cut to date. It’s infinitely more interesting than either of the two’s previous collaborations, back when both were still considered niche artists. Tape highlight ""Worth It"", produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"">Iamsu!</a>, offers <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvS9w-lTMc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3LW</a>-style sass, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx0xzO73Amo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Candy Rain""</a> sweetness, a hint of Iamsu!’s signature slap, and a minute-long sax solo by Khris Royal. Over production by duo Nez &amp; Rio, native Chicagoans who crafted some of drill’s formative hits (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJIhso-ldI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shout out Nez &amp; Rio / This beat is so stupido""</a>), Tinashe summons true vulnerability on ""Something to Feel"". The tape feels alive in a way little of her pre-<i>Aquarius</i> work had managed to, with a presence that punctures the numb glow of your computer screen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Subtle pop culture references are sprinkled throughout <i>Amethyst</i>: a riff on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBAtAM7vtgc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jerome’s in the house""</a> on ""Wanderer"", yipping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>-style adlibs on ""Looking 4 It"". ""I be twerkin' alone, looking for it,"" Tinashe sighs, and the moment reminds us that Tinashe has come to seem like a uniquely genuine presence in R&amp;B. She's someone who listens to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a> and weird SoundCloud remixes, who loves to geek out on Ableton in her room as much as she loves to get 2 on, a little sparkly but a little dark, someone who would be making this music even if no one was listening.</p></div>"|20388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20388-amethyst/|7.1|Meaghan Garvey

By the time Holden arrives to that line on ""Housebroken"", he’s shifted perspectives from a quizzical, concerned narrator to a dog that’s actually a person that’s actually a metaphor for the part of ourselves that legitimizes societal complacency. More importantly, a good number of people who heard the Hotelier’s breakthrough LP had no idea its predecessor, <i>It Never Goes Out</i>, even existed. And, ""My younger years were something, but that isn’t my life"" more or less sums up the fraught relationship the Hotelier have with their debut—while it’s a strong record whose songs are still included in their live sets, they’re just barely able to recognize the people who made it.</p>
<p>In a literal sense, the Hotelier did not make <i>It Never Goes Out</i>. <a href=""http://www.rockfreaks.net/files/a/1333446878.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Hotel Year</a> did. Moreover, the record was written when the band members were between the age of 16 and 18, living at home and struggling to be heard. After digitally self-releasing the record, the band signed to Mightier Than Sword, a punk label which <a href=""http://homelikenoplaceisthere.tumblr.com/post/70171251415/tomorrow-is-going-to-be-a-very-exciting-day-for"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Holden has maligned as predatory and underhanded at worst and defunct at best</a>. While it’s reasonable to see the reissue of a four-year old album as a victory lap after <i>HLNPIT</i>’s out-of-nowhere success, <a href=""http://www.tinyengines.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tiny Engines</a> is also ensuring that people can actually own a physical copy of <i>It Never Goes Out</i> for the first time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Heard again, <i>It Never Goes Out</i> does sound like the product of its environment, and those arriving to this record in 2015 will likely be startled by the youth of its creators—the word ""buttface"" is used in two different songs. Thematically, <i>It Never Goes Out</i> is guided by the most teenaged, punk perspective in existence: rejecting the expectations of middle-class suburbia and realizing the capacity for your own disillusion and disapproval. Holden’s tools are rudimentary here: not just<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/""> Beatles</a> (""Lonely Hearts Club"") and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">the Smiths</a> (""Title Track (There is a Light)"") references, but some of the most common ones. Walmart and Hallmark are castigated for co-opting love. Volumes of Nietszche and Thoreau are namechecked. Holden sneers, ""We’re all actors"" and the opener states ""Our Lives Would Make A Sad, Boring Movie"". Earnest, blowtorch-intense convictions like these are something of an occupational hazard for a young punk band, and when <i>It Never Goes Out </i>isn't skirting cliche, it's embracing it with a bear hug. </p>
<p>But these songs power through any sophomoric tendencies because even in their earliest days, the Hotelier were an unusually theatrical and ambitious punk rock band—these are songs you want to <i>act out</i> while singing. ""An Ode to the Nite Ratz Club"" and ""Title Track (There Is a Light)"" in particular are fully-formed Hotelier compositions that allow Holden’s rangy, expressive vocals free rein. They have already figured out how group chants and guitar solos can help ""anti-bro"" sentiments play well in a gym, a trait that distinguishes the band as the only mosh-pit/group-hug facilitators to rival <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"">Titus Andronicus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids"">Japandroids</a> over the last few years.</p>
<p>That said, <i>It</i><i> Never Goes Out</i> is a debut that registers more deeply in retrospect knowing what it leads to, particularly when it hints at what might have inspired <i>HLPNIT</i>’s most cathartic moments. During ""An Ode to the Nite Ratz Club"", Holden and a friend bond while committing petty, destructive acts around a construction site, ""Until the night when it got way too serious/ And you showed me your damaged wrists...And if I had only known that it would be the last time we'd be on that level with one another/ I would have never let you go."" It was a startling revelation then; three years later, it’s a possible connection to the suicides explored on ""Dendron"" and ""Your Deep Rest"". The album rides out on a glorious, call-and-response blaze, and it conveys a sweetness the Hotelier may never recapture. Four years later, it will always stand as the best album of the Hotel Year, the promising, awkward and strident band who labeled their music the work of <a href=""http://thehotelyear.bandcamp.com/album/it-never-goes-out"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""devotional kids""</a>.</p></div>"|20322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20322-it-never-goes-out/|7.7|Ian Cohen

You can forgive yourself if Kim's name isn't familiar: He was a minor but persistent radio presence during the late '60s and early '70s, and he's most known for co-writing the Archies' novelty hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9nE2spOw_o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sugar Sugar""</a> and for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ym3RlvVR9M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rock Me Gently""</a>, the type of innocuous AM trifles you're most likely in 2015 to hear as comedic relief in a Judd Apatow movie (or in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXUjSgWBhy8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">commercial</a> trading on that same aesthetic). Kim had several lesser, similar hits before going dark for several years, releasing some music as Baron Longfellow, and finally returning under his own name in 2004. (He was coaxed out of retirement by the Barenaked Ladies' Ed Robertson, which suggests that Kim is a much bigger deal in Canada than in the US.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>It's Decided</i> resurrects material from both writers' pasts in addition to new songs, and while the promise of marrying Kim's featherweight pop sensibilities with Drew's glowing orchestration is intriguing, the result mostly scans as ""pleasant rock music"" and nothing more. Kim has a metered, handsome baritone; it's the voice of an old showman, smoothed by singing ""Rock Me Gently"" to moms and grandmoms at innumerable county fairs and casinos. Drew, less excitable here than on BSS records, decorates the tracks with well-pruned horn charts and little keyboard doilies. The whole operation is very mature and artistic—see also Kim's man-in-black routine on the album cover—such that no one could ever confuse Kim with a man who sang some hokey songs many years ago.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kim and Drew are both artists capable of making you cringe, albeit for wholly different reasons: Kim for his cornball pop instincts and Drew for his bombast. You can hear some of Drew's puerile fascinations in the lyrics to ""Heaven Without a Gun"", just as you can spot Kim's lingering populism in the duo's re-working of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVh49cIHow0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shoot 'Em Up Baby""</a>, a doo-wop trifle Kim wrote in 1968. On BSS castoff ""Who Came First"", both Drew and Kim seem less tethered to pop-rock tradition, to more favorable results.  Elsewhere, the results sound something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"">the National</a>. What it all adds up to is anyone's guess. Is this a reclamation project? No one seems to be suggesting Kim's catalog is buried treasure. For better and for worse, there is nothing cringe-inducing on <i>It's Decided</i>; the record mostly sounds like I should remember to tip my barista.</p></div>"|20365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20365-its-decided/|5.9|Andrew Gaerig

Walsh was a founding member of hard-charging ‘00s electro outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2055-holy-fuck/"">Holy Fuck</a>, with an impressive production and engineering résumé to boot: he’s worked on recent efforts by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30564-metz/"">Metz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32165-viet-cong/"">Viet Cong</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31949-alvvays/"">Alvvays</a>, a collection of good records from bands with terrible names. (Perhaps it’s familiar terrain for a co-founder of <i>Holy Fuck</i>.) Fader has lent her voice to a handful of decent folk-rock records, and she released a set of unassuming folk-pop under her own name in 2009. While Walsh worked with Fader on that record, their work together as Etiquette is more of an equal partnership: she handled the bulk of the songwriting, Walsh shaped the album’s sound and atmosphere.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Walsh’s work with Holy Fuck revolved around the creation of electronic music’s sounds, rhythms, and shapes using entirely analog means. You can hear the vestiges of that idea on <i>Reminisce</i>, even though the album’s mood is very different from that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10838-lp/""><i>LP</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14207-latin/""><i>Latin</i></a>: there’s a texture and an unpredictability to the instrumentation that keeps it from feeling cool or sterile. Instead, <i>Reminisce</i> feels warm and cocooned, with synth melodies that hang low, heavy, and liquid. There are some saturated bass lines on the album, but those synths end up bearing a lot of rhythmic weight. They’re wrapped tight around Fader’s voice, with a balance between intimacy and spareness that’s reminiscent of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">the xx</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While some songs on the album take on a little of Holy Fuck’s bite and speed (the aggressive ""Twinkling Stars"", for example), the best ones are allowed to roast like they’re bubbling in a Crock-Pot, slow and humid. ""Attention Seeker"", a venomous wake-up call to a friend, is an obvious highlight, looming thick and heavy. The pace and density pair well with Fader’s narrow, affectless vocals, but I spent much of the remainder of </span><i>Reminisce </i><span>wishing for more range and dynamism on her part. A little variety and boldness could’ve been put to good use on the album’s back half, where tracks start to blend together into one wet, smoggy cloud.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cec2a3cd-336b-7a33-9be2-c83b66563c29""><i>Reminisce</i> does receive occasional jolts from the contrast between its sound and lyrical themes. Fader and Walsh’s partnership extends beyond the studio to their domestic lives, and they’re working with a set of consciously ""sexy"" signifiers, but this isn’t a collection of goopy love songs. It’s colored by loneliness and uncertainty, and even a bit of sourness. ""Brown and Blue"" is a good example, with Fader singing over synth patterns that sound a bit like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"">Tame Impala</a>: ""It’s the tilt of your head when you try to decipher/ What I am saying/ And the look in your eyes, I can’t tell/ If it’s weary or overwhelmed."" The song ends on a more positive note, but you can’t get into that kind of detail unless you’ve spent enough time staring at someone’s face to recognize tiny changes; they’re the sort of minute physical reactions that happen naturally when you’re tired of trading blows over something that’s ultimately meaningless. It’s subtle bits of writing like this that make <i>Reminisce</i>’s intimacy feel real and earned: peeks at the work it takes to keep love alive and thriving.</span></p></div>"|20361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20361-reminisce/|6.7|Jamieson Cox

In both artists’ worlds, the stakes are unbearably high, the characters’ motives are unclear, and morality is knotty, but there is a central force you can feel steering every moment. The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzZHydZEV4E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Good and Bad Hair""</a> musical routine from Lee’s 1988 feature <i>School Daze</i> depicted black women grappling with colorism and exclusionary standards of American beauty. Mookie’s climactic window smash in 1989’s <i>Do the Right Thing</i> plunged its characters into fiery bedlam, quietly prophesying the coming L.A. riots in the process. In these moments, you could feel the director speaking to you directly through his characters and their trajectories. Lamar’s records, while crowded with conflicting ideas and arguing voices, have a similar sense of a guiding hand at work.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lamar’s new album, <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, doesn’t explicitly bill itself as a movie like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"">good kid, m.A.A.d city</a></i><i> </i>did, but the network of interlocking dramas explored here feels filmic nonetheless, and a variety of characters appear across the album’s expanse. The opener, ""Wesley’s Theory"", turns the downfall of action-star-turned-convicted-tax-dodger Wesley Snipes into a kind of Faustian parable. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4102-snoop-dogg/"">Snoop</a> drops by on ""Institutionalized""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dre</a> himself phones in on ""Wesley"". The mood is wry, theatrical, chaotic, ironic, and mournful, often all at once: On ""For Free? (Interlude)"" an impatient woman ticks off a laundry list of material demands before Kendrick snaps back that ""This dick ain’t free!"" and thunders through a history of black oppression, spoken-word style, as if to say, ""This money you crave, it’s blood money."" The album is dotted with surreal grace notes, like a parable: God appears in the guise of a homeless man in ""How Much a Dollar Cost"", and closer ""Mortal Man"" ends on a lengthy, unnerving fever-dream interview with the ghost of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"">2Pac</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The music, meanwhile, follows a long line of genre-busting freakouts (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">The Roots</a>’ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology_%28album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Phrenology</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"">Common</a>’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Circus_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Electric Circus</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"">Q-Tip</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13471-kamaal-the-abstract/""><i>Kamaal the Abstract</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"">André 3000</a>’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakerboxxx/The_Love_Below"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Love Below</i></a>) in kicking at the confines of rap music presentation. There’s half a jazz band present at all times; pianist Robert Glasper, producer/sax player Terrace Martin and bass wizard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a> give <i>Butterfly</i> a loose, fluid undertow every bit as tempestuous and unpredictable as the army of flows at Kendrick’s disposal. The rapper’s branching out, too, exploding into spastic slam poetry on ""For Free?"", switching from shouty gymnastics to drunken sobs on ""u"" and even effecting the lilt of a caring mother on ""You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said)"". It turns out Kendrick’s new direction was every direction at once.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite all this, he’s still toying with a narrative on the sly: Just beneath the surface lies a messianic yarn about avoiding the wiles of a sultry girl named Lucy who’s secretly a physical manifestation of the devil. Kendrick refuses to dole out blame without accepting any, however, and on the chaotic free jazz excursion ""u"" he turns a mirror on himself, screaming ""Loving you is complicated!"" and suggesting his fame hasn’t helped his loved ones back home. Kendrick’s criticisms, as they did on <i>good kid</i>, come with powerful, self-imposed challenges. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29167-bilal/"">Bilal</a> quips on the chorus to ""Institutionalized"": ""Shit don’t change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Kendrick’s principle of personal responsibility has treaded dangerously close to respectability politics lately, especially after a prickly remark about the Mike Brown shooting in a recent </span><a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6436268/kendrick-lamar-billboard-cover-story-on-new-album-iggy-azalea-police-violence-the-rapture"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Billboard</i> <span>interview</span></a><span> that seemed to pin the death on the victim, but </span><i>To Pimp a Butterfly </i><span>avoids that trap.

""Complexion (A Zulu Love)"" is a tender note of appreciation for women of all skin tones with help from North Carolina rapper Rapsody (whose slickly referential guest verse contains a nod to ""Good and Bad Hair""). This is an album about tiny quality of life improvements to be made in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It might not be the message we want in a year where systemic police and judicial inequality have cost many the ultimate price, but that doesn’t bankrupt it of value.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-46efe0aa-2f66-f1f3-f353-7b1f7fa443c7""><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> pivots on the polarizing lead single, ""i"". Upon release last autumn, the sunny soul pep talk came off lightweight and glib. When it appears deep in the back end of <i>Butterfly</i>, though, ""i"" plays less like the jingle we heard last year and more like the beating heart of the matter. To push the point, the album opts for a live-sounding mix that ditches out midway through, giving way to a speech from the rapper himself. In tone, the speech is not unlike the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ2PEJGeNHw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>legendary 1968 concert</span></a> where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a> waved off security and personally held off a Boston audience’s fury after news broke that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. ""How many niggas we done lost, bro?"" Kendrick shouts over the crowd. ""It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left."" Underneath the tragedy and adversity, <i>To Pimp a Butterfly </i>is a celebration of the audacity to wake up each morning to try to be better, knowing it could all end in a second, for no reason at all.</span></p></div>"|20390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/|9.3|Craig Jenkins

Smith (guitarist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"">Explosions in the Sky</a>) and Matthew Cooper (multi-instrumentalist laptop composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1334-eluvium/"">Eluvium</a>) hit upon what seems, in retrospect, like a no-brainer collaboration. Joining skyward-facing post-rock to earthy ambiance, they clasped together like yin and yang, with the guitarist's widescreen beauty wending among the producer's sheer harmonic forms. They called their project Inventions, an ironic name for a band that sounded exactly how you imagined it would (personally, I'd have gone for Eluvium in the Sky with Diamonds). </span></p>
<p><span>It seemed like an idea that would work once and then quickly become redundant, but less than a year later, the duo proves that presumption wrong. <i>Maze of Woods </i>is a cut above your average sparkly instrumental zone-out music. It's still a welcoming, familiar pastiche of ambient, drone, shoegaze, and post-rock. It's also much thicker with compositional (instead of just textural) ideas, surprises, and a wealth of new sounds, like the majestic streaks of noise tearing apart the delicate tones of ""Moanmusic"" and scraping over the final track like an apocalyptic carriage arm. </span></p>
<p>Sometimes, you can tell a lot about a record by its remixers, and the ones included with <i>Maze of Woods</i>' bonus material—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15809-a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen/"">A Winged Victory for the Sullen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28582-leyland-kirby/"">Leyland Kirby</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">the Field</a>—help to frame the record proper. The album's use of short, slack loops echoes Kirby's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"">the Caretaker</a> project: A chorus wobbles on a tilted photograph in ""Feeling the Sun Thru the Earth at Night"", and distant string-like passages crop up in ""Slow Breathing Circuit"" like an amnesiac's memory. Meanwhile, the Field is reflected in the album's liberal use of drum machines, samples and towering, diaphanous chords.</p>
<p>For all of its dreamy moods, <i>Maze of Woods</i> frequently edges toward electronic pop, and is more expansive and dynamic than the debut. ""Escapers"", with a broken beat and dub-echoed voices, wouldn't raise an eyebrow on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> hard-drive purge, the storm clouds of ""Peregrine"" abruptly clear out into a bright <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada"">Boards of Canada</a> knock, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"">Orb</a>-like twinkles scatter over big frosty peaks on ""Wolfkids"". Smith's guitar is often recognizable and he provides a variety of delicate effects, from hollowed-out thwacks to what sounds like a glockenspiel made of lasers. </p>
<p>The album also makes subtle but widespread use of the kinds of clipped, deformed vocal samples we're used to hearing in electronic music. A length of unintelligible aria twists through ""Springworlds"" like a lost ribbon, and chattering voices are woven deep into the piano-rich fabric of ""Peregrine"". Throughout, and to the album's benefit, the duo's individual identities are more fully dissolved, so they can be more malleable in pursuing the idea behind a given song.</p></div>"|20370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20370-maze-of-woods/|7.6|Brian Howe

(She meets her demise later in the episode.) Within ""The X-Files"" universe, spanning more than two-hundred episodes and nine seasons, Lorraine Kelleher is a minor part, to say the least. But producer Kai Hugo nonetheless chose the name for a track on his second full-length release under the Palmbomen alias. The track, with its canned claps, faux woodblock clops, acid lines and laser pips slowed by cough syrup, is a strange and woozy standout on an odd yet amiable effort.</p>
<p>As Ganz Nackisch, Hugo favored the dusty-stylus distortion and filtered-house thump that was already out of fashion in France in the late '00s. By the time of his 2010 EP <i>Moon Children</i>, he had shifted gears, favoring the slo-mo arpeggios, 2am-hour synth washes and reverbed vocals popularized by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/""><i>Drive</i> soundtrack</a>. ""Stock""—off his 2013 album <i>Night Flight Europa—</i>embraced the sounds of the continent, from Italo to taser-riddled electro but not much of it stuck. While past productions dabbled in vocals,<i> Palmbomen II</i> does away with them entirely and the album is decidedly more insular and the better for it, sounding like Hugo recorded it all while locked in his bedroom.</p>
<p>If he did so it seems likely he was simultaneously watching every last DVD of ""The X-Files"": Each track on <i>Palmbomen II</i> derives its name from a character on the show, and Hugo's choices, like ""Lorraine Kelleher"", reflect an obsession and peculiarly deep knowledge of every sub-minor and one-off character. There’s no ""Knowle Rohrer"" or ""Marita Covarrubias"" to be found here, much less ""Toothpick Man"" or ""Luis Cardinal"", so even adepts of the show might not glean the connection. Instead, Hugo has a track named for the systems analyst situated near a volcano on Mount Avalon who had a silicone-like tentacle burst through his throat in one early episode (""Peter Tanaka"") as well as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>-esque one-minute interlude named for Mulder’s mother, ""Teena Mulder"".</p>
<p>Taken in one setting, the album could use a bit more movement, BPM-wise, its pacing somewhere between drugged and extremely hungover. ""Gerd Thomas"" feels lethargic, the sluggishness of the 303 and handclaps offset by a sprinkling of marimba. The interlude ""Caitlin Ross"" sounds like it could be from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> demo and ""Rebecca Waite"" rides percolating tropical hand drums, distorted thumb piano and a rattle that makes for one of the album’s brighter moments. Tape hiss infuses every number, giving the album a sense of nostalgia, right down to the garbled tape outro of ""Leo Danzinger"". But Hugo seems to be invoking the '90s not as a vague point of reference, but as a very specific point on a timeline. I’d peg it to 1992-1993, right when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>’s own homemade acid compilation <i>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</i> cuts off and when Chris Carter’s ""The X-Files"" first goes on the air.</p></div>"|20323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20323-palmbomen-ii/|7.3|Andy Beta

It’s not a nostalgia-driven record, but you can definitely catch a whiff of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"">T. Rex</a>, and eyeliner-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> wafting through the band’s heavy riffs and stoned melodies.</p>
<p>However, <span class=""il"">Wand</span>’s most obvious touchstone is a little more contemporary: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a>. Over the last couple of years, Segall and his close-knit crew<span>—</span>bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"">White Fence</a><span>—</span> have established a headier and heavier take on dinosaur rock by amping up the tempo and coating familiar-sounding riffs in a layer of lo-fi psychedelic grime. From the double-tracked falsetto vocals to the alien guitar tones, their influence is clear and present on <i>Golem</i>. <span class=""il"">Wand</span> aren’t sound-alikes, but they also aren’t shy about appropriating moves from the other bands in their scene.</p>
<p>And they’re pretty good at those moves. Evidently there are no hard feelings: Wand has opened for Ty Segall and the band’s singer/guitarist Cory Hanson has also accompanied Segall comrade <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"">Mikal Cronin</a> on the road. Wand’s debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19650-wand-ganglion-reef/""><i>Ganglion Reef</i></a>, was released on Segall’s <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a> imprint, <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/products?filter_label=GOD"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GOD?</a> It’s a bit like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a> releasing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24134-badfinger/"">Badfinger</a> on Apple<span>—</span>an act that took heavy inspiration from their more well-known mentor/producers, but also delivered independently memorable material on their own in a similar style. </p>
<p>There are some notable differences, though. Where their peers might ground stoney riffs in personal and real-life inspired subject matter, Wand’s tunes tend to dwell in the wizard candle-lit realms of the fantastic. Some of Hanson’s lyrics (""The forest is soft and the spiders are dead"") sound like they might have first been uttered in the midst of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. And who knows, maybe they were; the members of Wand <a href=""http://thewildmagazine.com/blog/cory-hanson-wand-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">have been known to play the game</a>. </p>
<p>Fantastic imagery aside, D&amp;D is not a bad platform for understanding Wand. The game makes use of established ground rules, but the tone and setting can be embellished to suit the tastes and interests of the players. Wand’s foundation lies in the old-school prog/psych sourcebook, but the songs often wander away from the script in a way that is refreshing. Glimpses of pop nostalgia are regularly smeared over with anachronistic synthesizer squiggles or blotted out with heavy rock riffs reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"">the Melvins</a>. These are the record's best moments—when a Marc Bolan vocal seamlessly blends into the kind of tape-collage weirdness that might have been at home on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/521-butthole-surfers/"">Butthole Surfers</a> LP. Still, listening to <i>Golem—</i>which arrives via Los Angeles garage and weirdo-rock standby <a href=""http://intheredrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In the Red</a>—it’s hard to shake the been-there-done-that feeling. Wand excels at delivering heavy and murky sounds, but they're a bit late to a conversation that their peers have already dominated.</p></div>"|20338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20338-golem/|7.0|Aaron Leitko

The biggest appropriators, like Harlem’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30605-aap-mob/"">A$AP Mob</a> and Miami’s Raider Klan, have repurposed the sounds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24062-dj-screw/"">DJ Screw</a> and the lingo of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5406-ugk/"">UGK</a> into a sort of chopped-and-screwed noir. It’s a haunting take on trill culture that sucks out most of the funk, leaving only distorted vocals and waves of ambience. Houston up-and-comer Maxo Kream is taking heed of the poachers and embracing their renditions of Houston rap and culture. He isn’t interested in reclaiming the city from squatters; in fact, he’s more than willing to play by their rules, and on <i>Maxo 187</i> he seeks a middle ground between the city’s perception and its reality.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The record is a sinister and visceral portrait of Houston street life that binges heavily on the A$AP brand of trill, even enlisting one of its producers (A$AP P on the Boards). The music is a binary of local Houston and the more panoramic, now global idea of Houston, which spawned the #BEENTRILL movement and the widespread abuse of lean. Kream's sound is far more derivative of the A$AP crew than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10668-z-ro/"">Z-Ro</a>, but his music is still deeply indebted to Houston gang culture. The music is most menacing when Kream drapes his gangland tales over creeping synth progressions and pulsating bass lines reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29688-spaceghostpurrp/"">Spaceghostpurrp</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoi5LF9NDvo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pheel tha Phonk 1990""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kream has been completely indoctrinated by gang culture, and on songs like ""Thirteen"" and ""KKK"" his raps are imbued with the rhetoric. At times, it’s borderline propaganda: On ""Paranoia"", which is produced by A$AP P on the Boards, he raps remorselessly about killing civilians and decapitating grandmothers for some sort of greater good (""Fuck your opinion I’m just trying to make a living""). It's chilling, in part because he doesn't even sound like he's trying to convince anyone that what he’s doing is worth it. <i>Maxo 187</i> doesn’t portray cripping as an escape from the hood but a liberation from ordinary life.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The lyrics are peppered with occasionally complex ideas exposing the corrosive nature of gangs, and Kream softens these ideas with accessible metaphors. When he finds the right balance between the two, his wordplay clicks. ""My boys goin' pop I ain’t talkin' Backstreet/ My guns goin' pop and the bullets in sync,"" he raps on ""1998"", laying the groundwork for a personal flashback to the year in question. Most of his more engaging rapping takes place when he avoids talk of homicide altogether. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32490-father/"">Father</a>-assisted ""Cell Boomin"" and dual-sided ""Trap Mami / Flippin"", both produced by Houston beatsmith Wxlf Gxd, are drug peddler anthems with bouncing flows t<span>hat explore static thump and a syrupy codeine haze. </span></p>

His message was clear: The city has changed, so its sound should change with it. However, Kream has tethered himself to the A$AP interpretation of Houston rap and the music he’s making now is heavily shaped by the outside perception of his city, the reappropriation of Screw into something even more ominous. Though Kream maintains his ties to Houston street life, he continues to find himself in the reflection of those that have been pantomiming H-Town rappers for years now instead of those within the city limits.</span></span></p></div>"|20356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20356-maxo-187/|6.6|Sheldon Pearce

In that time, they haven't really changed their basic formula: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6569-brian-chippendale/"">Brian Chippendale</a> still bashes his drums with chaotic precision and bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15251-brian-gibson/"">Brian Gibson</a> manages to make four strings sound like many more. From the beginning, their mix of mayhem and heaviness brought to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27097-harry-pussy/"">Harry Pussy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a> playing at the same time. But they somehow showed up in big features in magazines that didn't normally care about noise, and in the record collections of people who felt pretty much the same.</p>
<p>The musical landscape around Lightning Bolt has shifted more than a few times during this period, but the duo continue full-throttle with the kind of triumphant blitz they served up when they first emerged from Providence, R.I. When Lightning Bolt started in 1994, future <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"">Black Dice</a> member Hisham Bharoocha handled vocals and guitars for the band, and the difference between the two groups is instructive. Black Dice came out of the same punk/art-school world as Lightning Bolt but they chose a more winding path—from violent punks to noise mongrels to psychedelic noisemakers to gleeful <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a> electronic tweakers. LB have remained tunnel-vision focused. The respect for the initial approach suggests an endless possibility in a few gestures, a sensibility that runs counter to the over-stuffed, ADD, and of-the-moment world we live in.</p>
<p><i>Fantasy Empire</i> is their first LP in five years; it's also the first recorded in a proper studio—<span>Pawtucket</span>'s Machines with Magnets—and you can tell. The sound is bigger and more defined; they haven't cleaned things up, exactly, it's just easier to figure out what's leveling you. You can make out deeper textures and striations, and the greater detail lends variety without shifting away from the blown-out repetition. There's also a larger dynamic range—just when you think a song's gotten as big as it possibly can, they pile on more sounds like live loops, synthesizers, tape constructions, and bass overdubs. Rather than serving as a compromise, the shifts that come with higher production values are positive.</p>
<p>Some of Lightning Bolt's mid-period albums grew dull after repeat listens, or made you think about how you'd rather see the music performed live. <i>Wonderful Rainbow</i> from 2003 had an almost pop catchiness to it, and you get that here, too. With a few listens, there's a feeling of anticipation for certain breaks or shifts or, as at the end of ""Over the River and Through the Woods"", head-bangs. And more than any of their records, if you play it loud, and close your eyes, it's very easy to imagine being in the same room as the Brians. (They've been doing some of the songs at their shows since 2010, and the album has a very broken-in feel to it.)</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Chippendale's vocals have gotten stronger, as he's moved from the early chirps and howls to legit contact-mic crooning. His voice has typically been another strand of noise; here he feels like more of a proper singer, one who can compete with everything going on around him. At the start of ""Over the River and Through the Woods"" he clears his throat like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22778-celtic-frost/"">Celtic Frost</a>'s Tom G. Warrior, and later in the song, he's a strangulated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3180-ozzy-osbourne/"">Ozzy</a>. On ""Horsepower"", he approximates a swaggering demigod on the riff party, while ""Runaway Train"" sees him turn into a metal circus barker. The band's last full-length record, 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13577-earthly-delights/"">Earthly Delights</a></i>,<i> </i>had a metal edge to it, and as the comparisons above suggest, Lightning Bolt go further in that direction on <i>Fantasy</i>. This is noise doom, more or less, the crystalline tone and soloing on ""Dream Genie"" is the stuff of Steve Vai heaven, and ""Horsepower"" brings to mind Geddy Lee howling into a maelstrom kicked up by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a>. This is also their most flat-out rock'n'roll album to date, and their best since <i>Wonderful Rainbow</i>.</p>
<p>Most of the tracks have an anthemic forward march—these songs are built for speed. That's especially true of the massive 12-minute closer, ""Snow White (&amp; The 7 Dwarves Fans)"", whose tongue-in-cheek title nails the essential Lightning Bolt aesthetic: part punk rock, part adult fairytale. They're still doing what they've always done, but <i>Fantasy Empire</i> is the best they've done it in a long time, and the new sheen makes everything seem magic again.</p></div>"|20174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20174-fantasy-empire/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

His latest full-length solo release, <i>Trap Genius</i>, is in the same lineage, offering a newly straightforward take on Southern-fried street rap. </p>
<p>Tree has his sights set on lean, ATL-esque club records here but, perhaps despite himself, <i>Trap Genius’</i> songs always come out in his own highly specific style. His ragged but tuneful baritone recalls Howlin’ Wolf more than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a>, and, as always, it lends his songs a weighty, soulful quality. He supersedes and reframes beats better than he rides them, especially when they’re not his own.</p>
<p>The primary ""trap"" signifier is Tree's rigid, triplet-ized flow, which these days is put to use by everyone from unofficial patent owners <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a> to trend-hopping chart-toppers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>. Tree’s take on it, however, is far from conventional. He's not by nature a nimble rapper—he raps fast, but never treads lightly—and on tracks like ""Betta Than Eva"" and ""Red Yella"", a lengthy set of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-hq_CHNH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Versace""</a> triplets creates something of a bull-in-a-china-shop effect. Tree careens across the beat like a heavy projectile, papering over negative space and integrating bluesy inflections, sometimes singing from the gut in a nod to gospel.</p>
<p>The prevailing tone of the songs is celebratory, finding Tree enjoying the spoils of his labor as a rapper; he’s not offering the perspective of a gangbanger, but of an entrepreneur who proudly ""got [money] without ever touching the 'cane."" However, the ghosts of the lifestyle he grew up in—and his friends who are still caught up in it—lurk in the corners of his verses, and in the newscasts, cop radio dialogs, and field recordings of arrests that break up the tape. But these often faceless figures are side characters. For them, the money in which the rap-famous Tree revels (""Money the only thing matters at this point"") is a curse (""All the money in the world couldn’t save a homie"") that clouds judgment. One of the album’s standout images is of a friend ""sitting in county for weeks contained/ Dreaming of being free and broke.""</p>
<p>This best-friend/worst-enemy dichotomy is central to plenty of dope-boy rap, but the picture Tree paints is more complicated and is filled with contradictory perspectives. The cloud-rappy ""New or Leins"" even finds him telling the story of a woman looking for love in all the wrong places, visiting cheating boyfriends in jail. The panoramic approach is inspired, even when the shifts in vantage are abrupt, and the subjects underdeveloped.</p>
<p>Tree tends to linger between the cracks that define and politicize genres, themes, and flows, pitting them against each other in games of his own creation. He hears something that’s popular, figures out what people love about it, and then flips it at market price. The inclination is evidence of an omnivorous love of music, not an interest on cashing in on trends. What inspired him initially is always sublimated into his own sound; it’s ""soul trap"" even without the original beats to which the term usually refers. With no production from Tree, <i>Trap Genius</i> might not seem like a good way to get to know him as an artist, but all of his strengths are here, including his unique sense of rhythm, melody, storytelling, and economy.</p></div>"|20337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20337-trap-genius/|7.1|Winston Cook-Wilson

She delivers the phrase in an eloquently flat voice that suggests an Americanized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>, perhaps not as intimate but more agile in her phrasing, and she bends that last long ""O"" upwards toward a heaven that may or may not actually be there. She might be talking about death, but in the context of both the album and the song, it’s more likely she’s talking about something potentially worse: touring. You can’t load up the security and comfort of home with the guitars, amps, and drum cases, but there’s always room in the van for anxiety and disappointment. You might leave a friend or lover behind, and only occasionally will you find a bit of peace alongside the side of some highway. ""I found a new love,"" Bernstein tells her old love, ""a love of the new world and what it would be without you.""</p>
<p>Touring is not the subject of <i>No News from Home</i>. It’s more like the backdrop against which the band’s songs as well as its own story all play out: a necessary rite of passage for any indie act, an inevitable fact of life like taxes and that other thing. The four musicians in Houndstooth all know that life intimately: Before they played their first show together in May 2011, they cut their teeth in such Portland bands as the Parson Red Heads, Inside Voices, and the Threads of Grass. They had developed a local reputation as a dynamic live act skirting the difference between breezy country rock and tightly-coiled krautrock, but when they recorded their first album, 2013’s <i>Ride Out the Dark</i>, they abridged their epic jams into tidy pop songs. It may not have been exactly representative of their onstage attack, but it showcased Bernstein’s distinctive vocals and John Gnorski’s spidery guitar licks and it allowed them to tour well beyond the Pacific Northwest. </p>
<p>That experience obviously informs both the sound and the subject matter of <i>No News from Home</i>. Especially on the slow-burn ""Amelia"" and ""Witching Hour"" (with its sly shout-out to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30506-donnie-joe-emerson/"">Donnie &amp; Joe Emerson</a>), the songwriting is sharper and more open-ended, as though the stories they’re telling are still unfolding before them. Furthermore, the band have developed a more confident dynamic, evoking a sense of motion and travel in the clash of guitars and the persistent click of Graeme Gibson’s snare. Album opener ""Bliss Boat"" sounds like a natural show closer, highlighting seemingly everybody in the band. There’s a subdued swing in the rhythm section and scrappy drama in the guitars, as the song builds fluidly into an epic jam that’s part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>, part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">Byrds</a>.</p>
<p>All that touring and woodshedding has apparently taught them not to waste a note, because the first side of <i>No News from Home</i> has a determined cohesion, sequenced to evoke the choppy rhythms of the road. Almost inevitably they lose some of that focus on side two, whose songs don’t have quite the same sense of purpose or that same sense of movement. Closer ""They’re Racing Tonight"", with its hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Springsteen</a> mythology, saunters instead of speeds off into the sunset, with so little sense of closure that you can almost hear the words ""To be continued…"" as that last organ chord fades. Hopefully, their next album will take Houndstooth even further from home. </p></div>"|20340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20340-no-news-from-home/|6.9|Stephen M. Deusner

A young band's stellar new record might be streaming for free on Bandcamp somewhere, but it's easily lost. Finding vital underground music often requires a resourceful middle person—usually, someone who goes to a lot of shows and owns an inordinate number of zines and tapes. It's to Andrew Savage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a>' credit, for example, that bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32151-beth-israel/"">Beth Israel</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29683-yuppies/"">Yuppies</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19485-eaters-eaters/"">Eaters</a> found an audience online. Each record on his label <a href=""http://dulltools.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dull Tools</a> seems to challenge complacency and subvert expectations. </p>
<p>True to the label's reputation, the Brooklyn band Pill prove slippery to pin down on their debut EP. Post-punk is implied in Veronica Torres' deadpan vocals and Jon Campolo's echoing guitar clack, but Ben Jaffe's saxophone scrambles the signal. Sometimes, his melodies recall Steve Mackay's foundation work on ""Fun House"", and elsewhere, he detours into skronking freakouts à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13692-pharoah-sanders/"">Pharoah Sanders</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"">Colin Stetson</a>. There are circuit-bent electronics and blasts of noise, dour monotone vocals sung in unison and all-out screams. Across the EP's five tracks, which were produced by Andy Chugg of the art punks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30104-pop-1280/"">Pop. 1280</a>, Pill keep listeners on their toes while navigating their own chaos.</p>
<p>While Jaffe's sax is a fascinating wild card, Torres' lyrics are the heart of this music. She targets seemingly innocuous moments in a relationship, peeling back the facade of domestic bliss and exposing ugly truths in shouted blurts. ""Personality Flaw"" depicts a couple who initially appeared compatible, but now are locked in a war of wills where nobody wants to compromise. ""TV Wedding"" explores how technology glosses over real-life despair. On ""Hotline"", Torres playacts the role of a ""California blonde"" in a one-sided conversation that's clearly predatory in nature. (""Oh, you wanna touch me <i>where</i>?/ Oh no, I'm younger than <i>that</i>!"") The narratives are sometimes abstract and symbolic, but Torres' phrasing has a way of cutting through the haze. On ""Psychic Nipple"", after several lines alluding to entitlement, she delivers the devastating clincher ""Privilege is a warm body that loves you.""</p>
<p>This is where Pill showcase what they're capable of—they are loose with form, they pack in a lot of ideas, and they successfully deliver an emotionally complex narrative where joy is accompanied by an impossible-to-ignore undercurrent of danger. The band's debut outing is enigmatic—a Dull Tools record through and through—but it's also well crafted, full of stellar performances and unflinching lyrics. Not bad for a band's first recordings.</p></div>"|20366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20366-pill-ep/|7.4|Evan Minsker

Under her own name and as <a href=""http://jesuislepetitchevalier.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Je Suis Le Petit Chevalier</a>, the French musician, painter, and writer makes sound art that consistently feels like the articulation of a single, inimitable brain. <i>A Readymade Ceremony</i> might be her most literally intimate effort to date. Often it sounds like she’s sitting right next to you, whispering into your ear with her hand cupped around it. The up-close effect of her voice is matched by her music, whose tones, drones, beats, and samples are so detailed, it’s as if you’re listening through a microscope.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That aura of privacy pervades the album so thoroughly that it seems inappropriate to focus on any individual track. But one piece does serve as the record’s center of gravity, a kind of album-in-miniature capturing the greatness of the whole. The 10-minute </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/shelter-press/a2-felicia-atkinson-loeil"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""L’Oeil""</span></a><span> features Atkinson whispering words ""extracted and derived"" from the 1941 </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Bataille"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Georges Bataille</span></a><span> short story </span><a href=""https://thesorcerersapprenticeonline.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/no-18-madame-edwarda.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Madame Edwarda""</span></a><span>. Beneath her rolls a bed of wind, static, rumbles, and a plethora of other environment-building sounds.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There’s a tactile feel to that backing, but when placed behind Atkinson’s hypnosis-inducing vocals, it all feels like it’s happening subconsciously. Repeating simple phrases like ""I used to be played more often"" and ""hanged by the shower curtain’s rod,"" her voice seems to comb across your skin, in a sort of avant-garde version of </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>ASMR.</span></a><span> But the point is less about inducing physical response—though ""L’Oeil"" is practically telepathic in that way—than about simultaneously engaging brain, heart, and gut. You feel it because you understand it and vice versa. The words Atkinson intones and the notes she summons are equal parts sound and sense, so the way she says something and what it means become inextricably linked.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The rest of </span><i>A Readymade Ceremony </i><span>extends that alchemy, always feeling both tactile and subliminal, literal and abstract. Atkinson’s past work often involved dense, sometimes obscuring layers of echoing sound. But here there’s a new sense of lucidity and spaciousness that feels refreshing, like a sun shining after fog has cleared. By bringing her sounds into sharper focus, Atkinson has sacrificed none of their depth—in fact, getting to see everything makes it more obvious how much is going on.</span></p>

The breadcrumb trail of news reports depicting their progress over the years—they were recording with<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52454-nirvanas-krist-novoselic-plays-on-modest-mouses-new-record/""> Krist Novoselic</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42358-modest-mouse-and-big-boi-working-together/"">Big Boi</a>; they were switching producers—gave the worrying impression of a band that maybe didn’t know what the hell they were doing. In 2013, they <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51057-modest-mouse-cancel-tour-to-work-on-new-album"">canceled a tour</a> to hit the studio, and somewhere in there founding bassist Eric Judy quit the band. The process left in its wake some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35634-new-song-modest-mouse-autumn-beds/"">dropped</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35935-stream-a-new-modest-mouse-song-history-sticks-to-your-feet/"">singles</a> and a few different release dates, along with a lingering sense that maybe this venerable indie institution’s creative motor was stuck in neutral.</p>
<p><i>Strangers to Ourselves</i> finally sees the light of day this week, and to hear Brock tell it, we’re getting another album ""as soon as legally possible."" They are <i>back</i>, in other words, and vigorously making up for lost time. For better and for worse, the album betrays no signs of its troubled birth. They might have spent eight years in the wilderness, but what they have delivered is…a Modest Mouse album, one that sounds like it could have been released five years ago. There are no new directions or tweaks to their approach. ""Lampshades on Fire"", the first single, is a good example. It offers a sort of greatest-hits version of all the sounds Modest Mouse have become known for—""Here’s the hard-swinging backbeat! Here are a few of those eerie-sounding harmonic guitar bends, and  here are some tight, clipped 'bah bah bahs!'"" Still, there’s satisfaction to be had, hearing this band of pros finding and hitting their marks so emphatically. They've been a touring juggernaut for years now, and you can imagine many of these songs exploding live.</p>
<p>Here and there some new flourishes pop up. The glimmering mallet percussion on ""Ansel"" is a nice touch, something we’ve never heard on a Modest Mouse record before. Opener ""Strangers"" is a patient and pretty ballad, featuring drowsy brush work by drummer Jeremiah Green, a prominent cello line, and Brock’s gentle, lilting midrange. The delicately fingerpicked acoustic guitar figure in the beginning of ""Coyotes"" is also lovely, a bit of late-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>. ""The Best Room"" may or may not be inspired by a UFO sighting, as Isaac Brock coyly hinted in a recent <a href=""http://www.studio360.org/story/why-it-took-20-years-to-write-modest-mouse-new-single/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. But the song is an unruffled and sweet pop-rock number that hits a feeling Modest Mouse never bothered with in their earliest days: It is sunny, optimistic, relaxed. Not even ""Float On"", their massive hit and a teeth-gritted ode to positivity, had this easy sense of goodwill to it.</p>
<p>At times, the record feels labored, like you can hear every studio session that went into its creation. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-334daa5f-2473-43d6-a679-8d55cf26529d"">By the time the metal guitars have crashed into ""Sugar Boats""—and the tubas enter in a moment later, doubling over them—the song has grown both overwhelming and boring. ""Pistol (A. Cunanan, Miami, FL. 1996)"", meanwhile, is an overcooked, clattering mess, a sloppy retread of ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" that might be the worst song Brock has ever recorded. On these moments, you get the sense the band simply recorded for eight years until someone told them to stop</span>.</p>
<p>What’s ultimately missing are new ideas, or a fresh spin on their old ones. The lyrics, which used to be a very good reason to listen to a Modest Mouse record, are no longer the draw. Brock’s voice remains remarkable, an exclamation point he can bend into attention-getting shapes—a Tourette’s-like yelp, a heartburn-belch, a rooster crow. So lines like ""We’re the sexiest of all primates"" (""The Best Room"") are simply awkward, like a party quieting down just as you shout something particularly banal.</p>
<p>Any band that stays together for nearly 20 years, transitioning from indie to major label, losing and gaining members along the way, is going to change. A long time ago, Modest Mouse were known for volatile, destructive behavior and piercing insights, but their last two albums have positioned them as paragons of alt-rock professionalism, a band that takes their fans and their albums seriously and think hard about how to deliver on their expectations. Here they sound like they’ve settled into their status as a reliable indie rock institution. <i>Strangers to Ourselves</i> is a pleasant album, and one that completes their transition from ""inspired"" to ""sturdy"".</p></div>"|20335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20335-strangers-to-ourselves/|6.4|Jayson Greene

Though it’s been decades since the trailblazing techno-pop of solo albums like <i>Thousand Knives</i> and<i> B–2 Unit</i>, he’s continually revisited pieces from throughout his career, including his time in the seminal electronic trio Yellow Magic Orchestra. Sakamoto has released more than a half-dozen studio albums of reconfigured material, making his discography less a straight line than a phylogenetic tree. A song like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btyhpyJTyXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Energy Flow""</a> might find its first spark of life as a brief commercial jingle, then expand into Japan’s first-ever instrumental chart-topper, then find its way into a modern classical form. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGs_vGt0MY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence""</a>, the iconic centerpiece of his soundtrack for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a> vehicle of the same name, has been re-worked repeatedly, including a bit-crushed reduction during recent live performances with German sound sculptor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/68-alva-noto/"">Alva Noto</a>. And 2002’s <i>Century of Reform</i> is itself a set of hypotheses testing the versatility of a single theme. Sakamoto’s great strength throughout his massive oeuvre is his search for new vantage points.</p>
<p>The Japan-only compilation <i>Year Book 2005–2014</i>, collecting rare and unreleased commissioned work, comes at a difficult time for its maker. Last summer, Sakamoto announced that he’d been diagnosed with throat cancer, and would be taking some time away to prioritize treatment. The 63-year-old musician’s output has since consisted of just one album, a live collaboration with Illuha and Taylor Deupree, recorded the year before his hiatus. The past decade has seen Sakamoto’s once panoramic focus narrow to the minute particulars of just a few genres: His collaborative albums with the likes of Noto, Deupree, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Fennesz</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4986-christopher-willits/"">Christopher Willits</a> each have their idiosyncrasies, but all deal mostly in cold drones and ambience, while his solo efforts have been mostly focused on piano. Thanks to the wide variety of contexts its 30 pieces were written to serve, <i>Year Book</i> winds up being the most representative—and rewarding—Sakamoto album of its titular period.</p>
<p>The opening invocation, ""Cantus Omnibus Unus"", is a severe Gregorian chant that stakes out new territory for the composer. The brief piece sets the tone for the first disc’s bleak minimalism, where fragments of Debussy keys shimmer gently along a barren digital landscape between pockets of warmth and harmony. These works demonstrate an intuitive grasp of the sounds Sakamoto has continued exploring with his Western collaborators of late, while the fragmentary ""Visionaire"" reminds that these are gestures he discovered for himself on 2002’s spectral <i>Derrida</i> soundtrack.</p>
<p>Breaking from its predecessor’s sustained tone, the second disc bounds in all directions. ""2099"" is a digitized take on free jazz textures, while a 2011 remix of Meredith Monk’s ""Astronaut Anthem"" repurposes the original’s tension to create a drowsy sense of bliss. Two pieces from Sakamoto’s collaborations with Fennesz wind up here: ""Ropa"", whose comforting romanticism is more akin to Leyland Kirby than anything off <i>Cendre </i> or <i>Flumina</i> ; and ""PEACE"", a tortured gale of noise made for an Amnesty International campaign against the death penalty. The three-part ""Dharma"" suite floats somewhere between Sakamoto’s <i>Little Buddha</i> score and his overlooked New Age tendencies, while the arpeggiated ""Meditation"" adds some classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> to the atmosphere.</p>
<p><i>Year Book</i> is also an endearing reminder that Sakamoto remains a man of great humor. ""AUDI 2011""—a title that might as well be vaporwave—observes ""the beauty of the Audi car’s streamlined body"" (says the liner notes) through a player-piano experiment not unlike those on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20156-computer-controlled-acoustic-instruments-pt2-ep/"">recent EP</a>, while ""Otowa"" sounds like a pointed commentary on the sterile pseudo-classical that usually steers luxury car commercials. And the two long ""Nokiartek"" pieces are without a doubt the most alienating creations ever billed to a major cellphone company. There’s a deep amusement in realizing that Sakamoto’s most corporate commissions tend to sound the weirdest and least sociable.</p>
<p>""Whitescape#2"", a haunted minute of piano and pixelation, takes us up to the weeks before Sakamoto’s diagnosis, and the end of his body of work to date. In his official announcement—<a href=""http://sitesakamoto.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">still tacked to his website’s front door</a>—he promises a return to music after a full recovery. There is no reason to believe he won’t. But even were he to stop writing music tomorrow, <i>Year Book 2005–2014</i> is yet more evidence that Sakamoto’s discography is by now a memory bank so rich and vast you could spend a lifetime in it. </p></div>"|20324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20324-year-book-2005-2014/|7.8|Jakob Dorof

From discarded band names<span>—</span>she has performed as Laura and the Tears as well as Hey Laura<span>—</span>to changes in style, the English singer has done her share of exploration before finally landing on her own name and a strong, confident electro-pop sound for <i>Soft Control</i>. It’s a big record<span>—</span>dramatic crescendos, orchestral arrangements, pounding percussion<span>—</span>for which Welsh enlisted a bevy of big name production and songwriting talent, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32713-emile-haynie/"">Emile Haynie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32338-devonte-hynes/"">Dev Hynes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5848-john-legend/"">John Legend</a>, and a slew of others.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While Welsh’s voice is undeniably powerful, it’s sometimes hard to differentiate her from her more well-known contemporaries. In a blind taste test, multiple songs here could be B-sides or demos from any of a number of British artists, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"">Florence Welch</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a>. Not bad company to be in, for sure, and Welsh is, vocally, on par with both. In fact, it’s more the fault of the sheer volume of collaboration on the album that keeps it from coalescing into a cohesive, forceful whole.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That said, Welsh makes good work of many songs on the album. The John Legend co-write ""Hardest Part"", with its heartbeat thump and minimal synth arrangement, allows Welsh to get her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13589-annie-lennox/"">Annie Lennox</a> on, bringing some real heat to an otherwise straightforward R&amp;B ballad. She transitions effortlessly from her power range into a delicate, breathy upper register, and the result is natural and tender. ""Unravel"", produced and co-written by Dev Hynes, is more a showcase for Hynes than Welsh, who performs the song beautifully, but without any particular individuality. It’s more of a Dev Hynes song than anything else, and on a debut where Welsh is clearly trying to define her sound, it’s a loss.</p>
<p>Laura Welsh really shines at extremes. Whether she’s breathless and restrained on ""Hardest Part"", or pushing the boundaries of her voice on ""God Keeps"", Welsh stands out when she’s allowed to plumb the depths of real heartbreak, confusion, and discovery. On ""Still Life"", a gentle, whispery R&amp;B track hidden towards the end of the record, production, writing, and vocals finally gel, with results that skew a little bit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7099-the-police/"">Police</a> and a little more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"">Sade</a>.</p>
<p>For an artist who has undergone so many identity experiments before her debut, <i>Soft Control</i> is a promising, if not groundbreaking, beginning. Welsh has staked her claim as a singer who can adapt to the needs of her various producers and co-writers. What’s next, then? To take that claim and carve out the place as one of the electro-pop women of power she is always compared to, by making an album that is cohesive and entirely her own.</p></div>"|20342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20342-laura-welsh-soft-control/|6.3|Maud Deitch

To date, the 27-year-old has guest vocals on songs by Le1f (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Dvfr1DlFM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Star Me""</a> and <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/le1f/air-max-ft-rahel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Air Max""</a>) and rapper/singer DonChristian’s album, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/donchristian/sets/renzo-piano"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Renzo Piano</i></a>. While her style is hard to grasp from her limited in-house contributions, on Rahel's recently released debut, <i>Alkali</i>, her approach mirrors that of her early '00s pop-R&amp;B predecessors like Nivea, Ashanti and others: passionate vocals, a surgical focus on relationship disappointment and a sometimes foolish urge to hold on to something that’s gone bad long ago.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What initially stands out most about <i>Alkali</i> is its lush production, which in large part comes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30213-the-drum/"">The-Drum</a>’s Jeremiah Meece, who’s also credited as an executive producer. While it could have easily fallen into the one-long-song trap that many do when chasing cohesion, <i>Alkali</i>’s sounds glide into each other, one track after another, their R&amp;B fundamentals enhanced by off-kilter elements like the vocal processing that’s sprinkled throughout the album. The tracks are also distinguished by Rahel’s biggest strength on the record: her charm.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Her lyrics may not mirror the en-vogue, complex masochism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>, but her around-the-way girl sentiment resonates nonetheless. Her plainspoken lyrics, coupled with her conversational delivery, make it easy to zero in on her troubles. At times, <i>Alkali</i> feels like a one-on-one intervention with your friend who’s in need. On ""Bae"" with fellow Camp &amp; Street member DonChristian, Rahel’s patience is running thin with a love interest who’s playing too many games, which perfectly segues into ""Restless"" where she demands complete honesty. It’s also during a distorted monologue in the latter where a giggly but serious Rahel urges, ""Stop frontin’...we grown now."" There’s often a seesaw of angst, playfulness and frustration in young relationships, which Rahel illustrates here quite naturally.</p>
<p>Rahel doesn’t spend the entirety of <i>Alkali</i> losing sleep over her uncooperative lover, though. At the midway point is ""The Break"", where the frustration  finally boils over into an ""I'm through"" proclamation. But, even in her exit, she’s still conflicted and attached: On ""The Current"", she sings a somewhat false-sounding ""we’ll be alright"" and ""I think we gon' make it.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What’s most interesting about <i>Alkali</i> is how it changes depending on its context. When taken in as a full narrative, the nuances are easy to single out and appreciate, but when removed from context, no track outside of the ones that featured her Camp &amp; Street teammates (""Bae"" and ""Flutter"") stand alone. There’s nothing groundbreaking about the content either. But maybe intricacy isn’t what should matter much for <i>Alkali</i>, an album very much about the heart.</p>
<p>On the album closer ""Easy"", Rahel brings the narrative to a gratifying conclusion, singing ""I feel like keeping what's mine/ 'Cause nothing is worth more than I."" After her agony and ever-changing emotions, the affirmation feels hard-won and honest. Wounded and disappointed, Rahel’s resilience, self-analyzation and ability to rid herself of baggage feels like a triumph—and it's one you can feel even if you’re just focusing on the music.</p></div>"|20298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20298-alkali/|6.8|Lawrence Burney

The most popular story about what happened next goes that some college kids in Indiana heard it and started a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=secretly+canadian"">record label</a>. Less well-known is the story of a young singer-songwriter halfway around the world: Irish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5983-glen-hansard/"">Glen Hansard</a>, then most notable for his role in the 1991 flick <i>The Commitments</i>, heard <i>Cease</i> and became obsessed. He wrote Molina a fan letter and was floored when Molina actually wrote back. The two struck up a friendship that evolved over the years: They toured and even recorded together, including a split seven-inch in 2000.</p>
<p>Molina’s death hit Hansard hard, but he took some solace in his friend’s music, assembling a group of musicians who had played with Molina and jamming. Initially, they had no plans to record, much less release anything, but the sessions went so well that they devised a tribute, and the result of his therapeutic re-immersion is an EP titled <i>It Was Triumph We Once Proposed</i>. Hansard chooses these five tracks as fan more than as a friend, and he wisely gives no thought to comprehensiveness. How could you possibly cover such a productive career in such a short tracklist?</p>
<p><i>Triumph</i> opens with ""Being in Love"", from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26175-songs-ohia/"">Songs: Ohia</a>’s 2000 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7334-the-lioness/"">The Lioness.</a></i> The song isn't one of Molina’s best-known compositions, which only makes its inclusion feel like a discovery. The original is slow, quiet, and intense, with Molina singing about the risks of any relationship over a rusty industrial beat, a churchly organ, and sharp stabs of guitar. Hansard gives the song a classic-rock makeover, transforming Molina’s dark musings into a chorus that sounds just shy of hopeful. ""We are proof,"" he sings, one beat before a guitar crashes through the vocal line, ""that the heart is a risky fuel to burn."" This is what the song might sound like if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2945-magnolia-electric-co/"">Magnolia Electric Co.</a> had recorded it, and it works so well you can almost hear Molina singing along.</p>
<p>Nothing else on <i>Triumph</i> surpasses this nervy cover. Rather than radically rethink the other songs, he wraps them around himself like a warm blanket. On ""Hold On Magnolia"", his voice wavers slightly as he sings about Molina’s favorite subjects: the road, the moon, the heart, the job at hand. Likewise, ""Farewell Transmission"" is a sturdy rendition of one of Molina’s most popular songs, with Hansard’s vocals drawing out the measured optimism in the lyrics. Molina is often described as a bleak songwriter, and after his death in 2013, his reputation for facing up to dark truths only intensified. ""The real truth about it is no one gets it right,"" Hansard sings, but he puts even more emphasis on the next line: ""The real truth about it is that we’re all supposed to try.""</p>
<p><i>Triumph</i> offers implicit argument that Molina glimpsed the light of morning in the darkest night, and this idea serves as the EP's most powerful tribute. It is also a welcome corrective to the idea that Molina's struggles with addiction and depression can be decoded through his lyrics. Hansard shows us Molina trying to be his best self in his music. The EP builds to an abrupt finale with ""Vanquisher"" and ""White Sulfur"", a pair of songs that barely pass the two-minute mark. Hansard closes the record with the line, ""So then, I have to be going, okay."" At first it sounds like a tearjerker, but Hansard owns the words and directs them toward Molina. It’s powerful not because it reminds us that Molina is gone, but because it makes him feel present once again, if only for a few minutes.</p></div>"|20336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20336-it-was-triumph-we-once-proposedsongs-of-jason-molina/|7.3|Stephen M.

Upcoming records from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30204-father-john-misty/"">Father John Misty</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30501-matthew-e-white/"">Matthew E. White</a>, and new kid/not-kid Tobias Jesso Jr. (he’s 29) would all center on an archetype now associated mostly with the 1970s: the weary dude, wise beyond his years, spinning tales of love and loss from his piano bench before moving over to a barstool. It’s an image that took hold during the '60s hangover, when baby boomers traded youthful dreams and started becoming their parents, a little less certain with each new season that they were, in fact, still crazy after all these years. This highly personal, smaller-scale music was less about The World and more about the geography of a wounded heart. Jesso, Misty and White, in their own ways, are all drawn to a similar directness, a love of the well-written song composed and performed solo. </p>
<p>Hearing Tobias Jesso Jr.’s album, <i>Goon</i>, it turns out he has less in common with his peers than we thought. Father John Misty’s J. Tillman is by far the most literate and complicated of the three songwriters, using a fictional persona to plumb the depths of his own desires and self-loathing. Matthew E. White is more producer and arranger than singer-songwriter, someone who lets the horn arrangements and mic placement do the talking. And Tobias Jesso Jr. is ultimately more of a wide-eyed innocent, a songwriter with a naturally expressive voice who has a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">McCartney</a>-like propensity for melody and an innate drive toward simplicity.</p>
<p>In the late '60s and early '70s, L.A. singer-songwriters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15999-randy-newman/"">Randy Newman</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3092-harry-nilsson/"">Harry Nilsson</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a> got their start by writing songs for others, playing small clubs on Sunset, and skulking around record label offices. Jesso did <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9528-tobias-jesso-jr/"">try writing for others</a>, but his rise could only happen on the Internet: Some songs posted to YouTube, an exchange with an admired producer (in the case of Jesso, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls"">Girls</a>' JR White), a debut record on<a href=""http://www.truepanther.com/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a hip label</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58647-tobias-jesso-jr-and-the-roots-play-how-could-you-babe-on-the-tonight-show/"">a ""The Tonight Show"" appearance</a> before the LP even comes out. This isn’t just luck, of course—Jesso already had some connections from his time living and working in music in Los Angeles and a few famous friends, and his little label is part of the indie juggernaut <a href=""http://www.beggars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beggars Group</a>. But if his quick ascent owes a lot to living in a networked world, his music sounds as natural as breathing. Jesso has a knack for writing songs that you feel like you’ve heard before, even if you can’t quite pin down a precise antecedent. Which is another way of saying he writes songs that sound ""classic"" in the best sense of the word.</p>
<p>The highlights here sound like songs that could be covered and interpreted any number of ways by other vocalists, with a rock-solid melodic and harmonic foundation. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17286-tobias-jesso-jr-how-could-you-babe/"">""How Could You Babe""</a> is among them, moving from slow, halting verses that build tension until the glorious release of the chorus. On the last refrain, Jesso pushes his voice in its upper register to the point where it cracks, a clever suggestion of desperation that speaks to his intuitive sense of phrasing. ""The Wait"" is a two-minute acoustic pop confection featuring Jesso on guitar, a weightless gem that floats by like a freshly blown dandelion seed. A pair of songs, ""Hollywood"" and ""Leaving LA"", hint at Jesso’s background as a journeyman musician in Los Angeles, but the main idea behind virtually every song is the precariousness of love and affection.</p>
<p>Fans of those YouTube demos had to wonder how Jesso’s intimate music might hold up to studio glare, but Jesso’s producers (White handled eight songs, Pat Carney of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"">Black Keys</a> two, and Ariel Rechtshaid one) treat his music with a simplicity that suggests utter confidence in the material. The songwriter’s voice, piano chords, and plucked acoustic are the focus, and bits of light drumming and the odd back-up vocal are often the only augmentation. The approach leads to songs that feel unusually whole. You couldn't imagine taking anything away from these songs, and it's equally hard to imagine adding anything.<b> </b>""Leaving LA"" is a masterpiece of sonic understatement, moving between solo piano and a blissful interlude of voices and what sounds like harpsichord. ""Bad Words"" finds Jesso’s voice pinched and distant next to a Fender Rhodes and subtle drumming. His vocal line and piano move in unison on ""For You"" as a violin saws away in the background; it all bleeds together until it feels like a single, intricately textured sound.</p>
<p>If Jesso seems to have a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/619-burt-bacharach/"">Burt Bacharach</a>-like command of how verses, choruses, and bridges can add up to more than the sum of their parts, he’s got a ways to go before giving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22398-hal-david/"">Hal David</a> a run for his money with the pen. The words are here to serve the music, to fit the rhythm and cadence of the tune rather than the other way around. In a couple of places (""Crocodile Tears"" and ""Can We Still Be Friends"", which sounds disconcertingly like the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7U3lo80YrQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">theme song</a> from ""Cheers"") that can lead to rhyme schemes so predictable in their girl/world obviousness as to become a distraction. But these moments are few, and Jesso overcomes<b> </b>them as McCartney did—with the sweetness of his voice. ""There’s a thing called hate/ And a thing called love, too/ Like the love I have for your Mom/ And for you"" reads awkwardly on the page, but Jesso’s smooth musical diction makes it sound almost wise. His voice couldn’t be any more suited to this kind of music if it was created in a lab, but beyond just hitting the notes he also has a great feel for inflection, how to squeeze the most out of every syllable and transition.</p>
<p>With its clear debt to a specific era, <i>Goon</i> has a meta quality, an album of music that illustrates the power of music. While the songs are almost all about heartbreak, they could be more likely to have you ruminating about the role music plays in heartbreak instead of the emotional pain itself, but this distancing effect, in which the songs unfold so patiently, doesn’t diminish the record’s pleasures. Of the trio of 2015 songwriters mentioned above, Jesso <i>sounds</i> the most like Nilsson, in terms of the grain of his voice and his ability to sound wounded while also floating just above his travails, but his music is very different in spirit; Jesso’s approach is to state things plainly, dress them up in a gorgeous tune, and sit down and deliver it in the most spare and economical manner possible. <i>Goon</i> isn’t an album of layers; what you hear is what you get, which in this case turns out to be something special.</p></div>"|20153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20153-goon/|8.5|Mark Richardson

The constraints of genre didn’t really suit him, and his best-known work was with German <i>kosmische</i> legends Popol Vuh, most notably in a series of soundtracks scored for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001348/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Werner Herzog</a>’s films. <i>Kailash</i> provides an introduction to the spare piano music Fricke worked on throughout his career, which was cut cruelly short by a stroke at age 57 in 2001. It’s been assembled by <a href=""http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Jazz</a>, in a loving tribute: The first disc contains a mix of released and previously unreleased piano works, while the second contains a score to a documentary Fricke co-directed with his bandmate Frank Fiedler in the mountains of Tibet. This material edges closer to the metaphysical side of his output with Popol Vuh—a smart move that could hook in fans who haven’t ventured into his lesser-known works. A DVD of the documentary, also titled <i>Kailash</i>, rounds out the comprehensive package.</p>
<p>The piano work here covers a considerable timespan, from 1972 to 1989. During these years, Fricke returned to the piano after years spent wandering various disciplines. According to David Stubbs’ krautrock book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Future-Days-Krautrock-Building-Germany/dp/0571283322"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Future Days</i></a>, Fricke studied classical piano as a child, played jazz-fusion later in life, worked as a film critic, and had something resembling a spiritual epiphany when poring over old Mayan texts (one such text was the inspiration for the name <i>P</i><i>opol Vuh</i>). Fricke had something of an obsession with purity, both in a sacred and literal sense—the Moog synthesizer that was his trademark for a while was replaced by the piano for, in his words, its more ""human"" and ""direct"" feeling.</p>
<p>If those quotes make Fricke sound like some kind of traditionalist, it was never a feeling conveyed in his otherworldly music. The soundtrack disc in this set contains many of the elements that became hallmarks in his work, including banks of foggy drones, reverberating cymbal splashes, and an air of dark rumination that conjures a decidedly inward-gazing spirituality. Fricke's soundtrack work stands on its own, apart from its visual stimulus, mostly because Fricke has a talent for imbuing his music with a strong sense of journey and place, making sure that contrasting ideas gently cascade into one another. There's a traceable arc from the prickly field recordings in ""The Garden Morya"" and ""Nomads Move"" to the gentle, wave-like structures of ""Last Village"" and the subtly creeping ""Valley of the Gods"". Fricke was clearly keen on reflecting both the light and dark side of his personality—something the <i>Kailash</i> soundtrack fully embodies.</p>
<p>The leap from the <i>Kailash</i> score to the piano work is only a departure in the tools Fricke used. It’s not hard to see how his spare work informed the slightly more full sound of his music under the Popol Vuh name. The suite of three ""Spirit of Peace"" songs build around slowly repeating motifs and moments of near silence as notes gradually fade to grey, which is exactly how the best Popol Vuh tracks work, albeit with different instrumentals. Popol Vuh’s classic <i>Hosianna Mantra</i> (1972) prominently featured Fricke’s piano playing, and much of the material here resembles a version of his ideas from that album with a few layers stripped out. ""The Heart"" is the centerpiece of this set, with Fricke flickering between tranquility and a jagged edge, occasionally letting out an audible sigh, obviously lost in the circular shapes that engulf him in his art.</p>
<p>The piano works make abundantly clear that Fricke was a musician with an exquisite ear for when <i>not</i> to play. He comes close to letting loose on the rippling mid-section of ""Moses"", but holds back, allowing the track its own painfully mournful exit. Both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/827-julian-cope/"">Julian Cope</a> (in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrocksampler"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Krautrocksampler</i></a>) and one-time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a> sideman Gary Lucas (in a <a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Wire</i></a> epiphany) compared Fricke to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"">John Cale</a>, and it’s not hard to see why. They share a classically trained background, which they would try to escape from and embrace at various times in their careers. The positively jaunty (by Fricke’s standards) ""Garden of Pythagoras"" even resembles Cale’s piano playing on his and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>’s elegy for Andy Warhol, <i>Songs for Drella</i>—a record about love and loss and the wonder of formative experiences. Those big concepts are all over this album too, demonstrating how Fricke could summon them up with the lightest of gestures.</p></div>"|20242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20242-kailash/|7.3|Nick Neyland

Outsiders might focus on guns, strip clubs, and trapping, but the city's borders are limitless, and Two-9, the collective that includes Curtis Williams and duos FatKidsBrotha (Johnny and Dave) and Retro Su$h! (CEEJ and Jace), are vital examples of what lies just outside those lines. They are versed in trap music, and their sound might superficially recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32494-peewee-longway/"">Peewee Longway</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31028-young-scooter/"">Young Scooter</a>, but their lyrical focus is more varied and their energy cooler. They built up an independent buzz, and last year, they signed with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/?"">Mike WiLL Made It</a>’s <a href=""http://www.interscope.com/eardrummerrecords"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ear Drummer Records</a>. In February, they released <i>B4FRVR, </i>their first full-length project. In a city where everyone is striving to be <i>that</i> next rapper, on <i>B4FRVR </i>Two-9 appear unconcerned with grabbing the solo spotlight.</p>
<p>Two-9 don’t hop on each other’s lines or burst halfway through a verse to give a couple bars; they’re organized and reserved. Cross talk is limited to skits that transition between tracks. On highlight ""Money Counter"", the hook of ""money counter sounding like a chopper"" is given space to breathe instead of being <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8kNWkAcMBw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">repeated to a point</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-hq_CHNH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">of near meaninglessness</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-0kZ_jeIHI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like other Atlanta acts</a>. That careful attention to structure benefits the Mike WiLL-produced sweet slow jam of ""She Could Be Shawty"", but in other moments it makes the tape feel a little like a Saturday night house party afraid to disturb its neighbors.</p>
<p>Signing with Mike WiLL Made It’s label doesn't appear to have boxed them into his production camp. Gothic trap 808s appear on ""Verified"" and ""Functioning"", but the rest of the tape is far more laidback. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32198-metro-boomin"">Metro Boomin</a>, who has made earth-shaking beats for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>, gives them ""Full House"", which feels perfect for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a>’s signature cabanas. Opening track ""Gather Round"", from producer Childish Major, is a bit of dusty soul that manages to recall a time in Atlanta rap before ""trap"" became a catchall term. Metro and Childish are transplants to Atlanta, from St. Louis and South Carolina respectively, but Two-9’s vision of their city expands beyond the confines of the I-285 highway loop.</p>
<p>The only thing missing from <i>B4FRVR</i> is any kind of warmth or apparent joy. At the end of ""Full House"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a> bursts into laughter, and it immediately becomes the most relatable moment on the tape. He’s clearly having a blast recording, where the rest of Two-9's members appear too reserved to even hint at such enthusiasm. <i>B4FRVR </i>reps its city, gives good vibes, and perhaps next time Two-9 could enjoy their own party.</p></div>"|20318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20318-b4frvr/|6.5|David Turner

Their self-titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11929-pyramids/"">debut</a> from 2008, released on Hydra Head, was a beautiful mess, filled with lush tones that traced jagged musical directions. Sometimes, they were <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1394-emperor/"">Emperor</a> reconfigured as a dream pop group, other times, they sounded like someone left a drum machine running on a <a href=""http://lovesliescrushing.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lovesliescrushing</a> track. Even though black metal and shoegaze were obvious reference points, Pyramids felt alien to both. They were like explorers making up the map as they go. After a series of collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30180-horseback/"">Horseback</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3124-nadja/"">Nadja</a>, and <a href=""http://wraithshc.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wraiths</a>, Pyramids finally return with their sophomore album, <i>A Northern Meadow</i>. Here, they’ve developed a front-to-back sound that pushes their metal leanings to the forefront, while also upping the enigmatic glow of their debut. This consistency leads to their strongest effort yet.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A lot has transpired in the Pyramids camp between the two records: namely, Hydra Head shut down and Pyramids moved to <a href=""https://www.profoundlorerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Profound Lore</a>, Hydra Head’s successor of sorts as a leader in groundbreaking metal. Vocalist and founding member R. Loren concentrated on his label, <a href=""http://handmadebirds.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Handmade Birds</a>, as well as his side projects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29223-white-moth/"">White Moth</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29093-sailors-with-wax-wings/"">Sailors With Wax Wings</a>, in that period too. Pyramids never really went away, but they hadn’t made a proper album in some time, so it’s no surprise that they’ve changed quite a bit. <i>Meadow</i> commits to layers upon layers of black metal swirls, cascading riffs never ceasing except to leap to another song. They’ve got a better grip on their ambient influences by infusing them into the guitars rather than leaning on electronics. Even their most obviously black metal song, ""The Earth Melts Into Red Gashes Like the Mouths of Whales"", is smoothed into gleaming waves by how the riffs float and the alternating sonorous voices of Loren and M. Craig. ""I Have Four Sons, All Named for Men We Lost to War"" is one of their most aggressive tracks, but sifted through their vision, it’s stripped of chest-beating primitivism. It reinforces that beauty and heaviness are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In ""I Am So Sorry, Goodbye"", some of the self-titled's jagged beauty reappears. It leads off with a chopped riff dripping with melancholy, and towards the end, the melodies break apart and disintegrate like space debris in slow motion. Closer ""Consilience"" also explores this seductive decay, but in a smoother, more gradual fashion. Guitars spiral ever so gracefully into a black hole, dying slowly but not without one last kiss to the audience. This album benefits from one idea being taken to its limits, as opposed to the free-wheeling of their debut.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For <i>Meadow</i>, Pyramids recruited some crucial names in experimental music and underground metal to augment the core lineup. French black metal genius Vindsval, leader of the shape-shifting but always idiosyncratic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23037-blut-aus-nord/"">Blut Aus Nord</a>, takes over drum programming from D. William, who focuses on electronics. Vindsval drives a black metal pulse beneath the guitars' veil, making him a shadowy figure more in control than it seems. (Funnily enough, Loren does a spot-on impression of Vindsval’s vocals on ""The Substance of Grief Is Not Imaginary"".) Colin Marston, an esteemed metal producer who also abstracts metal in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"">Krallice</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31518-gorguts/"">Gorguts</a>, contributes guitar, and his touches are all over the record. He, with original guitarist M. Dean, steer the bands towards death metal in the main riffs of ""Grief"" and ""Sons"", and processed through Pyramids, it sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30946-portal/"">Portal</a> with prettier vocals. Vindsval and Marston both contributed to remixes that came as a separate disc on the self-titled record, and their familiarity with Pyramids' vision makes them natural allies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30644-william-fowler-collins/"">William Fowler Collins</a> rounds out the guest lineup by providing an ambient undercurrent that runs in and out of the record. This heavy roster of powerful names might send expectations soaring, but where <i>Meadow</i> succeeds is that no personality, from the core group or the guests, dominates. They all fall into and become one with the Pyramids aesthetic. This is in contrast to their Nadja <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13669-pyramids-with-nadja/"">collaboration</a>, which, while excellent, had clear lines where both bands came in. Vindsval’s appearance drew a lot of hype from metal fans anticipating this record, but this isn’t a Blut Aus Nord record outsourced to dudes living in a Texas college town. Pyramids are their own unit, and in owning up to their oddities and making them coalesce, not clash, <i>Meadow</i> becomes their most confident statement.</p></div>"|20261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20261-a-northern-meadow/|8.0|Andy O'Connor

""I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution,"" it purrs, echoed by synthesizers and guitars in the background. ""We became creatures that should not exist by natural law."" The warm Texas drawl belongs to none other than Matthew McConaughey, as the homicide detective <a href=""http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2657398/quotes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rustin Cohle in HBO’s ""True Detective"".</a> ""I think the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our program and stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal,"" he says, and for the next five tracks of this powerful concept record, Andrew Curtis-Brignell speculates about how McConaughey might be right.</p>
<p>Curtis-Brignell started Caïna when he was only 19, using the project as a sort of solo exorcism. In 2005, the opening track of his raw first demo (which he’s <a href=""http://cainaband.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">made available online</a>) imagined life ""without these demons."" By 2011, he’d improved the production, expanded his techniques, and opened the membership to include occasional guests. But the theme of personal examination and upheaval had become the permanent thread: ""Modern day Sisyphus/ Rolling a boulder uphill,"" he offered during the massive, mythology-rich <i>Hands That Pluck. </i>""Remaking tower of Babel in my own image."" In heavy metal, movie samples often play their own self-reflexive game of ""Name That Obscure Horror Film or Philosophical Treatise,"" but the McConaughey sample opening of <i>Setter of Unseen Snares</i> suggests that Curtis-Brignell is trying to tell a broader story this time. It's not just that <i>he's</i> fucked; we all are. </p>
<p>Over an atmospheric mixes of black metal, industrial menace, and post-rock grandeur, Curtis-Brignell lampoons the systems we love and lean on for the record’s three-song midsection. Like its title suggests, ""I Am the Flail of the Lord"" conjures a divine monster essentially out to imperil us all. Over a sinister riff, the ferocious title track fantasizes of divine intervention but refuses to deliver it. ""Vowbound"" trots out scenarios of religious subservience, where sacrifices are made in exchange for supposed protection. The narrator prays like Isaac on the altar and sells his daughter off as Old Testament property. ""But my prayers go unanswered,"" Curtis-Brignell screams over the song’s rising action before chanting out the title like an unanswered schoolyard taunt.</p>
<p><i>Setter of Unseen Snares</i> is a work of synthesis for Curtis-Brignell, the point where he pulls many of the disparate styles and sounds he’s investigated during the last decade into 33 efficient minutes. That introductory collage, for instance, showcases the nuance of someone who has experimented at length with <a href=""http://cainaband.bandcamp.com/album/emitter-follower"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">drone</a> and <a href=""http://cainaband.bandcamp.com/album/furl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sound-art.</a> The title track staples <a href=""http://cainaband.bandcamp.com/album/litanies-of-abjection"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a little post-punk</a>—see the strangled, barbed riff that ricochets through it all—to menacing hardcore built by a quaking beat and Michael Ribeiro’s hoarse, forceful bellow. This, too, is the first Caïna album since 2008 to include the assistance of an outside producer; that second set of hands and ears, Joe Clayton, enable Curtis-Brignell not only to pull a decade of interests and explorations into one small space but also to have them fortify one another. Though this record lasts for only half an hour, it feels bigger than all Caïna releases, even the two-hour <i>Hands That Pluck</i>. </p>
<p>That quality become paramount for the final two tracks, which offer the brief rising action and climax of this atypically concise concept album. During ""Applicant/Supplicant"", Curtis-Brignell imagines a family making good on McConaughey’s idea after all, as the Earth’s ecosystem has crumbled. They climb in a spaceship and head for the ""horizon,"" only to realize that ""we are the damned."" The journey winds through blast beats and monastic chanting, death-metal precision and cinematic crescendos—tools Curtis-Brignell uses to make the tale of a few rubes in a sky-bound vessel both pitiful and poignant. ""Orphan"", the 15-minute finale, surveys the wreckage after the crash, sounding like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a> leading <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1822-guns-n-roses/"">Guns N' Roses</a> through ""November Rain"". There’s one last sustained onslaught of black metal as the end of the world arrives, fulfilling the album’s threat. It’s gorgeous and daunting, a moment that takes the theatrics of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30675-winterfylleth/"">Winterfylleth</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a> and shapes them toward a clear narrative purpose. <i>Setter of Unseen Snares </i>then simply fades into silence—a concept record beautifully and unapologetically finishing what it started.</p></div>"|20269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20269-setter-of-unseen-snares/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

She is on her third generation of pop iconhood, after all, and her work comes freighted with decades of discussions about sexuality, appropriation, and whether what she is doing is ""shocking"" or ""fake"" or ""appropriate."" In the run-up to <i>Rebel Heart</i>, a series of bad-press flare-ups—myriad <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/xW44caGEUI/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram-based</a> <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/passantino/madonna-calls-her-son-the-n-word-on-instagram-deletes-commen#.gxn41Q1nNv"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">controversies</a>, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/03/10/madonnas-rebel-heart-pr-campaign-had-been-weirder-than-usual/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">comparing</a> her album leak to rape—suggested that maybe Madonna had slipped from our reality entirely. Yet, the surprise of <i>Rebel Heart</i>, her 13th album, is its groundedness, its centering of the Real Madonna in the mix.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In a way, <i>Rebel Heart</i> fits squarely into a growing canon that also includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20181-vulnicura/""><i>Vulnicura</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1763-kim-gordon/"">Kim Gordon</a>’s new memoir and the autobiography of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">Slits</a> guitarist Viv Albertine: female artists of a certain age making mature, candid work about divorce, and the rediscovery of the artistic self that follows in the wake of the rupture of their domestic life. <i>Rebel Heart</i>, like <i>Vulnicura</i>, digs in on the vertiginous aftermath (most spectacularly on ""Living for Love"" and ""HeartBreakCity""), and finds steadiness in the pure loves of children, the bedrock of self, and spiritualism. As is traditional Madonna™, her lyrics reach for top-shelf Catholicism, conflating spiritual and sexual salvation in a way that never makes entirely clear whether the supplication is being offered at the foot of Christ or a bedmate.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On the absolution-seeking ""Devil Pray"", she sings about the futility of escaping pain and recites a garbage head’s shopping list of street drugs that offer brief relief—including, but not limited to, sniffing glue. As she chants ""Save my soul/ Devil’s here to fool ya"" a bed of throaty, orgasmic samples rises in the mix, a hundred tiny Madonna-voices in coital abyss. It is a strange, tender, comical thing, this Madonna song that cites huffing and invokes the presence of ""Lucifer."" But ultimately, it’s a boring stadium-throb lite-EDM song about seeking sobriety and/or big-G God. It’s also a Madonna-doing-Madonna cliche, which is too often the downfall of </span><i>Rebel Heart.</i></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The good news is that most of the time, Madonna-doing-Madonna seems in on the joke. There’s the masterfully campy ""Bitch I’m Madonna"", and then the 50 Shades of What-the-Actual-Fuck of ""S.E.X."", which goes from trad break-you-off/come-inside talk to mentions of ""chopsticks,"" a ""dental chair,"" a ""golden shower"" and raw meat as erotic objects in a voice that sounds like she’s calling on her Creepy Frog phone while wearing a zipped fetish mask. On ""Holy Water"" she draws a comparison reminiscent of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vp4Qjkl_uA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey and Pepsi-Cola</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The deep production team on<i> Rebel Heart</i>—Ariel Rechtshaid and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a> in particular—have previously done work referencing classic '80s Madonna, and seemingly have a good sense of what suits her voice and still-evolving mature-era aesthetic. The soulful diva house of ""Living for Love"" sounds like it should have been the single off the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7717-mary-j-blige/"">Mary J. Blige</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20050-the-london-sessions/""><i>London Sessions</i></a> album, complete with celestial gospel chorus and piano 8s. It kicks off the album and serves as its thesis—Madonna as triumphant (yet vulnerable) phoenix from the flame, seeking good love and God, raving in the dawn after the darkness. Much of the 14-track domestic commercial version (as well as crushingly long 25-track super deluxe version) mines the same territory.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When she’s not hammering self-help maxims in the breakup zone, she is ordering the pop cosmos around her, much like she’s been doing since approximately 1985. ""Bitch I’m Madonna"" is a fantastic argument that <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2014/11/20/sophie-diplo-nicki-minaj-and-madonna-have-recorded-a-song-together-according-to-diplo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Sophie, Nicki Minaj, Diplo &amp; Madonna album</a> should come out, like, <i>tomorrow</i> and save everyone’s summer. It’s corny and glorious, its Nicki verse the most energizing 26 seconds of the album—and it’s also a convincing plea for big-tent EDM to get weird. On the surface it’s essentially the most artful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30345-keha/"">Kesha</a> song anyone’s ever made, but grows progressively more warped and bubblegum until it falls apart amid seizing saw synths. It’s Madonna as cartoon diva, but then it’s piggybacked by the pained ballad flipside: On ""Joan of Arc"" she opens up, as much as any ultra famous pop performer can in four minutes, about how hard it is to be the public Madonna, followed by paparazzi and dissected by trolls online. ""Just hold me while I cry my eyes out,"" she sings. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It’s a curious cocktail, one that makes it seem like she is actively taking on the mantle of What Madonna Means To Us In 2015. </span><i>Rebel Heart</i><span> finds her recoiling and resigning from it, refusing it, fucking with us, examining her own history and playfully crushing it under her boot heel. Yet, while some songs never quite make their point, others drill down on bad ones. The cringe-inducing ""Body Shop""—wherein Madonna takes a body-as-a-car metaphor into mortifying territory that makes you wish for an Auto Wrecker: ""You can polish the headlights/ You can smooth out the fender."" (Bon Scott is probably spinning in his grave like a rotisserie chicken.) With songs like that sandwiched between unabashed bangers and tenderhearted treacle, and constant codeswitching from Madonna the character to Madonna the human being, </span><i>Rebel Heart</i><span> grows confusing and irreconcilably uneven as it progresses. As valiantly as the album tries, it’s hard to hit reset on the Madonna we’ve known and loved, after 30 years of campaigning for our hearts and minds.</span></p></div>"|20293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20293-rebel-heart/|5.1|Jessica Hopper

It might be surprising to hear this piece of black, gay underground dance culture drift into Ariana Grande's sphere, but part of what draws major-label collaborators (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/"">Tinashe</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"">Charli XCX</a> and, now, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>) into Cashmere Cat's orbit is his Tumblr-ready ear, which is where today’s aesthetic subcultures flourish.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Ha"" isn’t as immediately identifiable on the Cashmere Cat song as it is on Lotic’s ""Heterocetera"". On the title track from the Berlin-based producer/DJ, the source is more obvious (and maybe more expected, given that J’Kerian Morgan is black, gay and American) but also lovingly massaged, cajoled like Play-Doh, into something colorfully reverent. Lotic filets the iconic cascading modular synths, sending screaming wisps out onto the track before sinking slowly into a bubbling, steaming pit of sound. It’s pretty macabre except for a hollow dembow, which moves the scary story along at deceivingly pleasant pace.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Heterocetera</i> might not be a happy recording, but that’s what makes the five-track collection so ambitious. This is Lotic’s third release in just over two years—his first for <a href=""http://www.tri-anglerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tri Angle Records</a>—and perhaps the clearest iteration of his phantasmagorical approach to clinical, after-hours techno. There are no overtures to pleasure, no simple hooks, entry points (save for the ""Ha"", if that does it for you) or clear parallels. The closest analogue to Lotic, at least energetically, might be fellow Texan <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/32825-travi-scott/"">Travi$ Scott</a>, who makes a similar mess of genre—hip-hop, in Scott’s case—and also brings a gothic energy to club music.</p>
<p>So, imagine this: it's 4 a.m., and you're in a room lit by a single red light bulb in the corner, Lotic’s ""Slay"" lumbering to life on the system. There is no bassline anchoring the warm, atonal synth lines. Instead, patches of distortion rattle around the skeleton of the track, forming an indistinct textural scaffold of percussion. It sounds like something slowly moving closer to you, perhaps crying to itself. Suddenly, everything in the room—the sounds, the people, the red light—feel like they're closing in around you.  </p>
<p>This is what Morgan does best: He takes disparate sounds and doesn’t tether so much as <i>nudge</i> them together, in a way that conveys an active mood. It's what so many other producers strive to do but can’t until they are far older than Morgan. A ""Ha"" sample might seem contrived to some, but he knows that, so he hacks away, letting its guts spill formlessly forth. His masterful way with configured elements provides the illusion of a story without dictating the narrative: Here, you decipher the tones and rhythms, and conjure your own ideas of good and evil.</p></div>"|20319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20319-lotic-heterocetera-ep/|8.0|Anupa Mistry

That's apt to be the case for 28-year-old Chicago rapper Gerik ""Gzus Piece"" Raglin, who was pulled over in Ohio on New Year's Day and arrested for allegedly trafficking over $15,000 in heroin. One-half of the bubbling Chicago duo White Gzus (alongside Marek ""Blanco Caine"" Fortineaux), Raglin now faces a legal battle which threatens to blunt a promising career before it even achieves lift-off.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Stackin' N Mackin' Vol. 2</i> is the duo's second release. A follow-up to their locally celebrated 2014 debut, the tape was recorded partially in the wake of Raglin's legal trouble. Possibly as a result, it can feel rushed, as if they ran out of time focusing the camera and just snapped the photo. What's good and at times great about the White Gzus project is that—despite the slight blur on the image—the picture feels fresh and unique.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Their ambitions are disarmingly straightforward. Initially a side project for both of its members—Gzus Piece and Blanco Caine are both a part of the Treated Crew, alongside recent G.O.O.D. Music signee <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32818-holt/"">Holt</a> and producer/former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> DJ Million Dollar Mano—they seem as surprised as their audience to have stumbled upon a rewarding recipe with a handful of familiar ingredients. The building blocks are 808s and sumptuous, enveloping grooves, a throwback to the sounds of labels like Suave House and Rap-A-Lot. Perhaps the best example is lead single ""Return of the G"", a twinkling Snapback-produced track which makes the most of its five minutes with an expansive, immersive sound. But a simple formula helps keep all records in bounds. The group's rapping reflects a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5406-ugk/"">UGK</a>-like dichotomy: Gzus Piece is the group's refined half, with a casually clever flow that sounds preternaturally unbothered; Blanco is rawer, more blunt. Their silent partner and musical glue is Mr. E, who produces several beats and is responsible for the tape's mixing and mastering.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Mr. E likes to repurpose hip-hop history to his own ends. At first glance, it can seem distracting. Tracks like ""Still Sippin'"" and ""Volume 2"" flip the same samples as hip-hop staples (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4388-three-6-mafia/"">Three 6 Mafia</a>'s ""Sippin on Syrup"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"">Raekwon</a>'s ""Verbal Intercourse"" respectively) with which White Gzus could never measure up. Yet this baldly tasteless re-purposing of the classics gives White Gzus an edge over other revivalists. Where others might pay slavish devotion, Mr. E simply swipes the originals and gives them a more modern, functionally effective kick.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This method also short-circuits songwriting liabilities for groups like White Gzus, who are under-funded independent artists without A&amp;Rs or access to high-profile collaborators. After all, the ""Verbal Intercourse"" sample is a classic for reason, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnkZADFFfYA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SWV's ""Use Your Heart""</a> flip on ""Cross Town Classic"" is an immediate canvas which draws on the contrast between Blanco's bruising rap style and its breezy '90s effervescence. This is simply clever production, sampling in the old school sense, deriving its creative force as much from economic necessity as anything else. Tracks without familiar samples can be more hit-or-miss; Mic Terror's chorus on ""Return of the G"" is one of the best on the album, and points to how hooks can be an occasional stumbling block elsewhere. ""Count Up"" is a terrific late '90s throwback with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a>-style ribbiting noises, but the sung chorus feels like it could use slight pitch correction to snap more tightly into place.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are missteps and visible seams here and there, but more songs work than don't. The group is just beginning to map out a new and fertile sound, a constellation of styles that manages to thread between the drill and backpack strains of Chicago hip-hop. If the sudden threat to Gzus Piece's freedom has served to frame the group's music with pathos it previously lacked, then so be it. But in an ideal world, he wouldn't have to go through that, and could instead mine this vein for all it's worth, since White Gzus really is just getting started.</p></div>"|20301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20301-stackin-n-mackin-vol-2/|7.3|David Drake

If it’s not his biggest hit (that would be the Oscar-nominated ""Miss Misery""), it’s certainly Smith’s most-covered song by a long shot, with jazz interpretations by Madeleine Peyroux and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3217-christopher-oriley/"">Christopher O’Riley</a>; faithful renditions by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5150-chris-garneau/"">Chris Garneau</a> and someone or something called Saucy Monky; live versions by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2888-metric/"">Metric</a> and Agnes Obel; even a strange performance by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a>, of all people. Millions of YouTubers with a guitar and a digital camera have uploaded a homemade cover, and are probably still doing so as of this writing.</p>
<p>With so many versions out in the world, it’s difficult to put a new signature on the tune, and maybe Avett and Mayfield should get credit for not even trying to make it their own. Instead, they sing it with an almost defiant reverence, as though consciously blurring the line between cover and karaoke. They dutifully preserve the structure and the tone of the original, adding only a few new details, such as the short, descending bass theme in the intro and the gentle stridency in the acoustic strums. Yet, for all their faithfulness, they can’t quite convey the conflicted emotions or the bleak undercurrents of Smith’s lyrics.</p>
<p><i>Seth Avett &amp; Jessica Lea Mayfield Sing Elliott Smith</i> is a document of two talented musicians trying to figure Smith out. The duo conceived this project in 2011 when the Ohio singer-songwriter toured with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5496-the-avett-brothers/"">Avett Brothers</a>. On backstage pianos as well as in professional studios, they picked their favorite tunes, devised new arrangements, and worked out new harmonies. Nearly everything on the album, however, will sound immediately familiar to any Smith fan, and any Smith newcomer is advised to check out <i>Either/Or</i> or <i>XO</i> first. That rambunctious piano still storms its way into ""Baby Britain"" at the same time, as though Avett sampled that part from the original. The guitar notes on ""Ballad of Big Nothing"" still bend into the same shapes. At least they punch up a pretty straight reading of ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" with some electric guitars and a rhythm section—a fine interruption of the album’s general solemnity.</p>
<p>But the only real risk they take is on Mayfield’s sped-up, roughed-up reimagining of ""Roman Candle"", off Smith’s 1994 debut. It’s brash and assertive, with Mayfield turning the violent central lyric (""I want to hurt him, I want to cause him pain"") on its head simply by changing the gender of its deliverer. Most of Smith’s songs sound aggressively lonely, as though he could never get out of his own head to connect with other people; having two voices on these songs could potentially transform Smith’s monologues into conversations, presumably between lovers. Especially on ""Baby Britain"" and ""Somebody That I Used to Know"", Avett and Mayfield strike an easy chemistry together, her exquisitely drowsy drawl offsetting his more expressive vocals. Still, they don’t play up the idea of <i>Sings</i> as a duets album, nor do they try to adjust the songs’ points of view or find new implications in the lyrics. Perhaps in the end they are simply too smitten with the idea of Smith as a beautifully doomed artist to create anything beyond a loving, reverent, and therefore sheepish tribute.</p></div>"|20204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20204-seth-avett-jessica-lea-mayfield-sing-elliott-smith/|5.4|Stephen M.

This stereotype persists even though the most visible and critically lauded bands are often the ones who buck conventions, whether the results succeed or not. (The embrace of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5803-nachtmystium/"">Nachtmystium</a>’s half-baked psychedelic black metal is a perfect example, as is any given <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"">Liturgy</a> press cycle.) Norway’s Enslaved have coasted on that odd critical goodwill for some time now. While Enslaved’s early 2000s work showed how complex and multi-faceted black metal could be, 2008's <i>Vertebrae</i> tread a little too close to alternative rock, pointing to the danger in conflating black metal ""evolution"" with ""accessibility."" Their more recent albums have dug somewhat back into their black metal roots, but their fascination with other, less extreme forms rock never waned, and on <i>In Times</i>, their 13th album, it officially becomes become their crutch.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""color: #000000; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"">Enslaved remain capable performers -- the opener “Thurisaz Dreaming” is filled with prime Norwegian blasting and screeches--but the prog-rock sheen on the record, like they only focused on the softer side of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25088-kansas/"">Kansas</a>, flattens out the fury. As a result, their raging and their simmering happen on the same wavelength. ""Building With Fire"" touches upon the band's more melodic work from <i>Below the Lights</i> and <i>Isa, </i>but other than that, there isn’t a whole lot differentiating one song from another, and many feel longer than they are. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A lot of this falls on Herbrand Larsen, who provides keyboards and clean vocals. His voice has an angelic pleasantness, serving as foil to bassist and lead vocalist Grutle Kjellson’s rasps, and sometimes it feels that’s all he’s there for. He holds back throughout, refusing to go all-out and overdrive the record. Parts that should feel grand, as a result, often feel bogged down and too comfortable. At the end of ""Nauthir Bleeding"", Kjellson and guitarists Arve Isdal and Ivar Bjørnson (who is a founding member along with Kjellson) rapidly intensify in attempting at reaching something glorious. Instead, Larsen neuters the song with soft-rock mewling, driven by some need to make it palatable, like he’s hosting a theoretical corpsepaint-and-cheese party.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Halfway through the title track, there’s a nearly poppy chorus of vocals that feels like it should liven the mood. It’s not a bad part in and of itself, as in the hands of a capable songwriter or producer—Devin Townsend’s pop-metal maximalism comes to mind—it could be incorporated successfully somewhere else. Here, it's just an odd fit among the dour seriousness surrounding it. </span><i>Times</i><span> is in need of ""Havenless"", their anthemic song from </span><i>Lights</i>, or at least something like it.<i> </i><span>It would break up the monotony here. </span><i>Times</i><span> isn’t offensively bad or controversial, and it might have benefitted from being either. Instead, we’ve got some Black Metal Muzak here, competent musically but too timid to go into the depths, emotional, musical or otherwise, that black metal should strive for.</span></p></div>"|20315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20315-in-times/|6.2|Andy O'Connor

It’s a hip-hop musical (<a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/6157599/tupac-musical-holler-if-ya-hear-me-swift-closes-broadway"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they don’t do well</a>) about a family dynasty (rap has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwS14TiO7Pk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">very few</a>) led by a tenacious singing mogul (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3yHhiqQaEU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hmm</a>) and the drug smuggling, songwriting wife who took a fall so that her husband and sons might prosper. It’s a ratings juggernaut,<a href=""http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/06/foxs-empire-breaks-23-year-record%5D"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> smashing decades-old records for increases in viewership</a> with every episode. It’s a hit on social media thanks to the scathing wrath and inimitable style of Taraji P. Henson’s matriarchal lead, Cookie. Unlike Fox’s last flagship musical serial ""Glee"", however, it is not matching its improbable Nielsen success on the Billboard charts thus far.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is not for a lack of talent. <i>Empire</i>’s resident musical supervisor is none other than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a> (with assistance from sometime collaborator Jim Beanz), who has supplied show creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong with polished, radio-ready sounds. Even so, the ripped-from-the-headlines story arcs that make the show so enjoyable for hardcore music fans sometimes hinder its music. The show’s lead performers are feuding brothers Jamal and Hakeem Lyon (played respectively by the pensive Jussie Smollett and the preening Bryshere Gray AKA <a href=""https://instagram.com/yazzthegreatest"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Yazz the Greatest""</a>). Jamal is the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>-reminiscent singer, both in his yearning, cerebral songwriting and his quest to find acceptance for his sexuality. Rapper Hakeem is a bad-boy type, a sort of amalgam of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29472-tyga/"">Tyga</a>, Chris Brown and Kid Ink. Hakeem’s girlfriend Tiana (Serayah McNeill) is an R&amp;B chanteuse who seems styled after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a>. It’s never clear whether ""Empire""’s music is meant to exist in the present mainstream hip-hop landscape or to mirror it as commentary.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s frequently suggested on the show that Hakeem values the night life more than his craft, and if the character is intended to be a sendup of pop-rap underachievers, it’s a respectable stroke of withering humor. Unfortunately there’s very little space between the performances on the show depicting Hakeem off his game and the ""good"" Yazz performances included on the soundtrack. The songs that are meant to validate him as a talent are ingratiating aspirational boilerplate. His calling card ""Drip Drop"" <a href=""http://themuse.jezebel.com/empire-tried-to-make-a-song-called-drip-drop-happen-1683942826"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">made</a> <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/2069534/empire-drip-drop/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">waves</a> online, but the mechanical precision of the performance kills it dead, and ""Empire""’s biggest Hot 100 success is the Jamal-led ""You’re So Beautiful"", anyhow.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Jussie Smollett’s Jamal is the light of the ""Empire"" soundtrack. When his lithe warble cuts through these tracks, you’re not cocking your head to the side to imagine a star; you’re hearing the real thing. He’s flashy on Tim’s sinister horn stomp ""Keep Your Money"" and sufficiently wounded on ""Good Enough"" to distract from striking similarities to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4920-justin-timberlake/"">Justin Timberlake</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOrnUquxtwA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Goes Around… Comes Around""</a>. Smollett nearly upstages Yazz with an unhinged vocal on the chorus of ""No Apologies"" and lends gravitas duetting with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5765-estelle/"">Estelle</a> on her recent single ""Conqueror"" that the song lacked as a solo cut. Small wonder Columbia recently<a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/1881418/empire-actor-jussie-smollett-scores-deal-with-columbia-records/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> signed him to a solo deal in real life</a>. (One hopes a similar windfall awaits Timbaland protege V. Bozeman, who wowed viewers with the rousing ""What Is Love"" in the show’s pilot episode, only to vanish for the majority of the season.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The soundtrack’s celebrity collaborators, meanwhile, are a mixed bag. Jennifer Hudson stops by to guide the nonmusical elder Lyon brother Andre through a mental health crisis on ""Remember the Music"" (and pops up alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a> for the carefree ""Whatever Makes You Happy""). J-Hud’s voice is gobstopping as ever here, but ""Remember the Music"" flubs a shot at mining her tear-jerking majesty on a piddling arrangement. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7717-mary-j-blige/"">Mary J. Blige</a> abets Terrence Howard’s patriarch Lucious Lyon on the stirring piano ballad ""Shake Down"", which succeeds in spite of (or perhaps because of) Howard’s histrionic vocal. The cracked-genius guest spot of the set is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2544-courtney-love/"">Courtney Love</a>, who guests as Elle Dallas, a fallen rock goddess staging a risky comeback. Her weathered torch song ""Walk Out on Me"" suggests she could do <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey"">Lana Del Rey</a> better than Lana Del Rey if she ever set the guitar down for good.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Empire"" is a wonder of absurd tricks and unforeseen turns, but the ultimate goal—rendering its music as something more than just a side platter to gripping TV—proves elusive. Where Jussie Smollett and the growing roster of famous faces lining up for guest appearances are concerned, it’s easy. But it’s still hard to see Yazz as much more than promising and eager for now. The ""Empire"" songwriting apparatus is still coming together, it would seem, but with upwards of ten million pairs of eyes trained on the show week after week, success can’t be far off. They’re warped enough to turn Dire Straits’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAD6Obi7Cag"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Money for Nothing""</a> into swag rap and to feed Courtney Love a gospel choir. There’s nothing they won’t try, and it’s exhilarating: Sooner or later, they’ll probably strike gold.</p></div>"|20299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20299-original-soundtrack-from-season-1-of-empire/|6.5|Craig Jenkins

But while Mendel has been Dave Grohl’s longest-serving foot soldier, he’s also the most unassuming one—he’s neither as iconic as Pat Smear, as flamboyant as Taylor Hawkins, nor as <a href=""http://www.fimho.com/wp-content/gallery/chris-shiflett-tattoos/Chris%20Shiflett%20Tattoos%206.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tattooed</a> as Chris Shiflett. Lieutenant represents his first solo bid, and the new alias feels like a sly nod to his deputy ranking in the Foos' megalithic machine. As the outrageously titled but tastefully executed <i>If I Kill This Thing We’re All Going to Eat for a Week</i> makes clear, Mendel is not the sort of guy to celebrate going solo by screaming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7rCNiiNPxA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m30s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I was always caged and NOW I’M FREEEEEEEEEE!""</a> Humble and soft-spoken to a fault, he often sounds as if he’s meekly tiptoeing around the shadows of his own spotlight.</p>
<p>Though the album boasts a formidable guest list of fellow alt-rock lifers—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a> drummer Joe Plummer, Page Hamilton of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1922-helmet"">Helmet</a>, Sunny Day’s Jeremy Enigk, and fellow Foo Shiflett—there are no scene-stealing cameos here; everyone involved respectfully adapts to Mendel’s relaxed, low-key wavelength. In sharp contrast to his day job, Lieutenant favors unwaveringly pleasant, gently swaying sing-alongs that would fit comfortably amid the more rustic end of the 21st-century <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a> roster, as a buffer between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"">the Shins</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29611-the-head-and-the-heart/"">the Head and the Heart</a> (whose Josiah Johnson also appears here). But even with the decibel meter dialed down to accommodate his wounded croon, Mendel struggles to assert himself, flattening out the album’s dynamic variation in the process.</p>
<p>The music bounds from breezy, string-sweetened chamber-folk (""Belle Epoque"") to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>-via-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3130-ric-ocasek"">Ocasek</a> power-pop (""Rattled"") to brooding power ballads (""Lift the Sheet""), but Mendel maintains a passive, shoulder-shrugging presence through it all, keeping the album’s heart rate steady, obscuring his lyrical intent, and muting its emotional impact. It’s an issue that’s only compounded when the arrangements get busier, like on the shifty, brass-bolstered ""Sink Sand"", which sounds like a holdover from the Foos’ New Orleans sojourn on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19864-foo-fighters-sonic-highways/""><i>Sonic Highways</i></a>. (By contrast, Mendel’s voice finds its most natural fit on ""Some Remove"", a pretty '70s soft-rock throwback whose gauzy Rhodes organ fuses perfectly with his wistful sigh.) Given the album’s dream-team assembly of players and broad instrumental palette, Mendel clearly has ambitions to create elaborate songs within intimate spaces. But listening to <i>If I Kill This Thing...</i> feels like staring into a terrarium: It's easy to admire the attention to detail and lovingly crafted quaintness, but hard to get inside.</p></div>"|20266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20266-if-i-kill-this-thing-were-all-going-to-eat-for-a-week/|5.8|Stuart Berman

The Toronto noise band's sludge-punk clamor reaches volumes that rival <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30564-metz/"">METZ</a> or Cellphone (Toronto has proven in recent years to excel in producing impressively loud acts), and the cacophony might not always offer the greatest support for a multifaceted voice like Mayberry’s. Her nuanced tone is buried even further under the primal shouts of lead singer, Jude, but if you listen beneath the din, it's clear that Mayberry actually has an exquisite voice. You can't help but wonder what it would sound like front and center.<br/><br/>Enter her other project ANAMAI, which is, in some respects, the polar opposite of HSY. Originally an outlet for Mayberry’s solo songs, ANAMAI came to fruition when she met electronic artist and producer David Psutka, a.k.a. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29413-egyptrixx/"">Egyptrixx</a>, whose background in London dance music places him far outside of Mayberry’s universe. But the two have found a common ground, and Mayberry’s solo project has evolved into a duo. Together, Mayberry and Egyptrixx have taken her ideas and formed songs rich with texture and palpable kinetic power. Their debut full-length, <i>Sallows</i>, is nothing like their main projects, focusing on an eerie experimental folk that brings a new kind of heaviness to Mayberry’s vocals.<br/><br/>To make way for Mayberry’s rippling voice, songs are kept rather sparse. Fingerpicked electric guitars are given space to swell up with each note, mingling with Mayberry’s echoes into a thick fog. Sometimes, drums and tambourines enter the picture, giving songs like ""Everyone"" and ""Black Crow"" more movement, but ANAMAI have established an inherently deliberate pace. On ""Half"", Mayberry languidly draws out a story of a potential romance over six minutes of a metronomic drone. Intermittently, she replaces choruses with one-liners like ""We kill time,"" sung with an ominous gravity. <i>S</i><i>allows</i> also includes three tracks from ANAMAI’s 2013 self-titled EP—""Mute Flames"", ""Altar Coals"" and ""Black Crow""—and they are the album’s most propulsive moments, polished and amplified to align with the whole.<br/><br/>With almost every song purposefully crossing the five-minute mark, Psutka's feel for atmosphere comes into play. Mayberry’s dirges come couched in cinematic settings that recall the early-rock'n'roll darkness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28408-timber-timbre/"">Timber Timbre</a>. On ""Mute Flames"", Mayberry’s fragmented phrases are placed beneath a swirling scrim of alien sounds. ANAMAI's ambitions lie in the same vein as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"">Julianna Barwick</a>, and while they haven't mastered the mood in one swift endeavor, they haven't deviated too far from the template. ANAMAI may not be as pummelling as a HSY record, but their metaphysical weight makes up for it, producing an even more striking result than Mayberry’s other band.</div></div>"|20312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20312-sallows/|7.1|Melody Lau

Few younger bands capture just how fucking <i>fun</i> heavy metal can be to listen to, but Ranger take riffs and speed very seriously and little else, which appeals to those wanting a rush without the seriousness of other, more extreme genres. On their full-length debut, <i>Where Evil Dwells</i>, they retain much of what made <i>Knights</i> memorable, while tweaking their sound just slightly to accommodate a longer running time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With two new guitarists, Ville Valtonen and Mikael Haavisto, Ranger throw in some classic NWOBHM licks in addition to the mix of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3TcCQzXyG8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Canadian</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQB3AUcZzWU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">German</a> speed metal they’ve cut their teeth on thus far. The melodic leads and anthemic vocals of ""Dead Zone"", for example, could be from Angel Witch or a pre-Bruce Dickinson <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden/"">Iron Maiden</a> cut. Where <i>Knights</i> proved just how relentless they can be, <i>Evil</i> reveals an ear for catchiness too. ""Phantom Soldier"" features some of their most gripping riffs, especially the bridge breakdown. You can easily imagine singer Dimi Pontiac (who also plays bass) whipping a crowd into a fist-pumping frenzy over it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With a need to make a strong debut statement comes sharper production, and Pontiac’s vocals benefit the most. His voice is much higher in the mix, which greater outlines his snarl. His high screams are still in evidence, but <i>Evil</i>’s production illuminates his normal singing voice, which has a snarky bite not unlike a less nasally Dave Mustaine. The attitude in his vocals carries as much weight as their riffs, and allows Ranger to harness the most adrenaline from their songs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ranger take one big risk on <i>Evil—</i>the ten-minute title track, just under half the length of <i>Knights</i>. Is it their ""At War With Satan"", Venom’s infamous 20-minute orgy of Satanic excess? Not quite: It sounds like they took two Ranger songs and just smashed them together. The only issue with ""Evil"" is its placement; it should close out the album, not the single ""Storm of Power"". ""Storm of Power"" is Ranger at their most concentrated and reckless, a blitz of light-speed solos, breakneck rhythms, and gang vocals, but it would work better placed earlier, as a way to build towards ""Evil"". But <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"">Metallica</a> worked in a similar approach on <i>Master of Puppets</i> by placing the grand instrumental ""Orion"" before the apocalyptic rager ""Damage, Inc."". Metallica, however, did things most bands couldn’t, then or now. It's a minor sequencing issue, though, and on the whole, <i>Evil</i> is not just an amped-up take on a classic form, but an exhilarating testament to how and why metal continues to gain younger converts.</p></div>"|20273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20273-where-evil-dwells/|7.3|Andy O'Connor

""I just like hitting </span><i>stuff </i><span style=""font-family: georgia, serif;"">that makes a noise."" That’s no grand revelation if you’ve followed him so far: Since the release of his debut EP, 2011’s </span><a href=""http://mokolours.bandcamp.com/album/ep1-drum-talking"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Drum Talking</i></a><span style=""font-family: georgia, serif;"">, the British/Mauritian composer has mixed hip-hop, soul and Afro-Caribbean dub with the Sega music of his homeland, resulting in hypnotic, tribal-infused dance grooves. Mo’s music is an acquired taste; beneath the percussive clatter is a rich, minimalistic approach that grows more contagious as it plays.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: georgia, serif;"">For Mo’s new EP, <i>How I (Rhythm Love Affair)</i>, he follows last year’s <a href=""http://mokolours.bandcamp.com/album/mo-kolours"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled LP</a> by sampling old R&amp;B records, blending obscure clips into his own jaunty African-themed melodies. He ditches the lo-fi aesthetic of his previous work for a clean mix that maximizes his use of crackling vinyl (""I Find My Eyes"") and woodwind instruments (""On My Way"", ""Sumerian Mother""). In some ways, the new gloss is welcomed: Mo’s music is understated enough, so it’s tough to vouch for great tracks like ""Mini Culcha"" and ""Mike Black"" when you can barely hear them. That’s part of Mo’s charm, though: He recedes into his music, his words never louder than a mutter as the beat unfolds. He unites disparate tones the same way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29949-paul-white/"" target=""_blank"">Paul White</a> does—by taking the most random acts of everyday life—a chant, a mouth click—and creating something clever. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: georgia, serif;"">There aren’t enough bright moments on <i>How I</i>, which breezes by far too quickly without much impact. Even the bright spots feel underdeveloped and none of the songs ever go anywhere. Take the Deniece Williams-sampled ""How I"" as an example: Here, Mo loops a lyric from ""Silly"" (""How I want you""/ ""How I love you"") and supplants it with layered drums and shakers. The concept works initially, except Mo never builds upon it; instead, he leans on the idea until it expires a short time later. The same goes for ""Sega Chuckle"", which has the best drum work of all the instrumentals, but Mo spoils it with shrieking vocal clips. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: georgia, serif;"">Mo knows how to make great EPs. 2012's <a href=""https://mokolours.bandcamp.com/album/ep2-banana-wine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Banana Wine</i></a> and 2013's <a href=""https://mokolours.bandcamp.com/album/ep3-tusk-dance"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Tusk Dance</i></a></span><span style=""font-family: georgia, serif;""> trekked the same spacious path as <i>Drum Talking</i>, but they seemed to stick. I can revisit songs like ""Bomptious"" and ""Biddies"" and feel the same good feelings as when they released. Without a strong anchor, <i>How I</i> finds Mo Kolours adrift, still searching for the right formula to catapult his sound.</span></p></div>"|20333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20333-how-i-rhythm-love-affair-ep/|5.8|Marcus J.

What if things blew apart just as you stopped joking? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"">Das Racist</a>’s career arc was never an obvious one—sometimes it was hard to tell if they were shrugging or lunging at us—and its solo members are now puzzling their way through the aftermath of an ambiguous legacy. Himanshu Suri, aka Heems, always felt like the breakout star, if the crew had such a thing. They were all funny, but Heems was also quietly charismatic and occasionally vulnerable: On Das Racist tracks like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMeAvOgDUdE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Amazing""</a> or <a href=""http://dasracist.bandcamp.com/track/17-you-can-sell-anything-prod-diplo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Can Sell Anything""</a>, he was all three at once. <i>Eat Pray Thug</i>, Heems’ new solo album, finds him summoning all of these qualities, some of the time, but the album as a whole isn’t vivid or well-realized enough to banish the sense that something is missing.</p>
<p>Heems has said in interviews that <i>Eat Pray Thug</i> is his most personal project. A handful of songs draw directly on his experiences as an Indian-American in a post–9/11 world, and they are sharply observed, painful, emotional, and deeply quotable. On ""Flag Shopping"", he offers vivid images in a halting, tom-roll cadence: ""Your dad mad, cuz he lost all clients/ Dad, why you crying? I thought that we had the spirit of the lion/ He take it out on you, his belt big like Orion’s."" On the album closer ""Patriot Act"", he adopts a short, bellowing delivery, nicked from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a> at his imaginary-crime-boss peak, to spit a tangle of contradictions: ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Product of Partition</a>/ Dripped in Prada for the stitchin', proud of superstitions/ Got powder in the kitchen."" Heems <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/arts/music/heems-talks-about-eat-pray-thug.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked</a> to the<i> New York Times</i> about his desire to reclaim rap language from the inside, and songs like ""Patriot Act"" show him doing just that, applying a lifelong love of hip-hop to the gritty particulars of a specific life. </p>
<p><i>Eat Pray Thug</i> isn’t lacking in ideas, just focus, and there are long stretches where it’s much harder to connect to Heems’ persona. ""Sometimes"", the opening track, produced by longtime collaborator Gordon Voidwell, is about ""dualities,"" as the rapper told both NPR and the <i>Times</i>, but here is an example of how that plays out in the song: ""Sometimes I’m like this, sometimes I’m like that/ Sometimes I’m pretty thin, sometimes I’m pretty fat."" Tossed-off lines like these lack the smart-dumb zing of his Das Racist writing or, really, any zing at all. Heems drones the word ""clarity, clarity"" for a few bars on the song, then deadpans: ""Sometimes I write hard, sometimes I’m mad lazy/ I just repeat words like ‘clarity,’ fucking crazy."" It’s DOA as a punchline, and reminds me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2772-encore/""><i>Encore</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"">Eminem</a>, where he’d fill up entire verses with the lamest jokes he could think of simply because he could.</p>
<p>The most uncomfortable moments on <i>Eat Pray Thug</i> are like this, watching a guy try for ironic laughs and failing, and they feel like unwelcome holdovers from Heems’ previous life. Wordplay like ""The great gats be the TEC-9 and AK"" (from ""Hubba Hubba"") only remind us how good he used to be at this sort of high/low culture switch-up. ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVe22Yew5Jw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Made enough friends</a>, like I play in the Wrens,"" he raps on ""Sometimes"", and as one of the people who actually gets that joke, I find myself unaccountably saddened that it exists outside of a chat window.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Heems reaches for styles that are simply beyond his grasp as a musician. ""Pop Song (Games)"", ""Damn, Girl"", and ""Home"" are stabs at accessibility that fail for a more prosaic and difficult-to-circumvent reason: Heems’ voice. Landing somewhere between pained groan and mocking whine, it lacks expressive range, and it points to the biggest problem facing Heems and his fellow former members: They were, from the beginning, a fragile musical equation. None of them were naturally appealing on the mic, but the three of them together, projecting camaraderie, sent a specific message: We might not be very good at this, but we’re <i>way </i>better at it than you realize. They hung together, in a hangdog sort of way.</p>
<p>Without that camaraderie, a lot of those obvious flaws, which were built into the DNA of the group, float to the surface, and 11 tracks of solo Heems proves to be a lot to take. Together, they were a bunch of bored, antic college kids, smarter than they seemed and maybe, sneakily, smarter than everyone you knew, masking some complex feelings behind jokes. Alone, they are three adult post-wiseasses, in search of a story as good as their last one.</p></div>"|20307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20307-eat-pray-thug/|6.3|Jayson Greene

""I just have a straightforwardly lizard-brained...'whoa…KILLER' reaction to hearing David’s rhythmic chops going off,"" Madak said, going on to note that watching DJs slip the tune into a set ""was like watching someone execute a really hair-raising parallel parking job in one shot."" Therein lies the thrilling paradox in Kennedy's dance productions: they are inscrutable, bordering on the avant-garde, and yet still provoke primal, dunderheaded glee. We're all still cavemen bashing sticks and rocks together, but one caveman taught himself polyrhythms.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kennedy has honed his highly rhythmic style over the course of a dozen-plus singles as Pearson Sound, most productively since he dropped his Ramadanman title in 2011. He's done so as one of the UK's most adventurous DJs and as co-head (with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30976-ben-ufo/"">Ben UFO</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28648-pangaea/"">Pangaea</a>) of London's <a href=""http://hessleaudio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hessle Audio</a> label, whose sparse release schedule has proved mostly bulletproof. (The label's weekly Thursday broadcast on <a href=""http://rinse.fm/podcasts/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rinse FM</a>, largely helmed by Ben UFO, is vital listening for fans of underground electronic music.) But whereas Kennedy's peers have cobbled together styles from house, techno, grime, and the remains of dubstep—and therefore tread in the middle of some Venn diagram or another—Kennedy's work seems to exist at a single nexus point, fully discrete, tangential to his surroundings.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Pearson Sound</i> is the long awaited debut album: nine terse, often brutish rhythm tracks laid out end-to-end, because ambient interludes and extended outros are for mama's boys and DJs, respectively. Kennedy's compositions consist chiefly of drums, most recognizable as such, and so the experience of listening to nine tracks in a row is not unlike having some dental work done under local anaesthetic—there's lots of painless drilling, popping, and clicking, perhaps some tingling. About 40 minutes later, it's over.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Pearson Sound</i> re-calcifies Kennedy's aesthetic after recent releases saw him dip his toes into <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6AFWHc3fgM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tonal arpeggios</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFdAQtOgd0I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gummy grime melodies</a>. His tracks are economical and athletic, prizing both strength and dexterity. This is borne out in tracks such as ""Glass Eye"", which doesn't seek to bash but dizzy, and does so with a paucity of elements: just some shivering snares and a liquid string figure.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Kennedy twists his drums just so, playing with dub and house conventions. His snares aren't treated with delay so much as suspended in gelatin, left to quiver, quiver, quiver until finding a state of rest. He's adept at using tonal percussion, crafting melodies from toms and congas the way some producers use pianos. Opener ""Asphalt Sparkle"" features what is either a hi-hat playing 16th notes or a chain being slowly pulled. The track's rhythm doesn't swing; it cranks. There's a natural, but ephemeral, comparison to the ""drum tracks"" that came out of Chicago in the mid- and late-1980s. Drum tracks were tools to help DJs house-ify their sets; Kennedy is composing with rhythm, an outgrowth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8811-shackleton/"">Shackleton</a>'s early dubwise singles or the nimble grooves of bass explorer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22116-loefah/"">Loefah</a>, placing him amongst the small group of producers who learned more from dubstep than how to book DJ gigs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What's refreshing about Kennedy's tracks—alluded to in Madak's quote above—is the amount of fun he wrangles out of such a sparse and austere template. The melodic elements are bright and whipsmart. The synthesized horn sound that buoys ""Headless"" sounds like it's being played by a sad emoji. ""Swill"" is like the ballroom classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_URFoqkwWLY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Ha Dance""</a> reflected in a funhouse mirror. ""Crank Call"" is a disorienting tour de force, featuring a ringing telephone, heavy breathing, and what sounds like a filter sweep being performed on a pack of laughing hyenas.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Perhaps unsurprisingly coming from an artist who mostly bangs on cans, the nine tracks on <i>Pearson Sound</i> don't represent any kind of narrative or linear progression. Even for a dance album—a notoriously tricky medium—it can feel disassociated, so just as you'll never doubt you're listening to Pearson Sound, you may forget you're listening to <i>Pearson Sound</i>. Another quibble: The harsher, craggier sound palette used here—the product of analog gear, reading the <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=27769"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">press junket tea leaves</a>—strips these tracks, subtly, of the graceful hypnosis of Kennedy's finest works (""Clutch"" and ""Lola"", in addition to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvCA_olsdsI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""REM""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5dwf_5eSQk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Untitled""</a>). Still, Pearson Sound tracks are lessons in how to push boundaries without sacrificing dance music's primeval instincts, and <i>Pearson Sound</i> contains nine such lessons. Bang some things together in celebration.</p></div>"|20177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20177-pearson-sound/|8.1|Andrew Gaerig

Essentially just natural runoff from the glut of afterparty compilations that overstuffed the ""various"" placards in dance music sections in record stores everywhere for most of the early 2000s, <i>Late Night Tales</i>’ big trick is a semantic one. By reframing these mixes so they’re more about a non-specific 3 A.M. state of mind as opposed to corny aspirational moods (lest we forget ""chillout"") or Balearic Valhallan ideals (the café, the beach house), the series has widened its brief to allow for more forms of early morning contemplation, in turn becoming a sort of Rorschach test for its contributing artists.</p>
<p>Thanks to appearances from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"">Air</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp/"">Röyksopp</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a>, the series has uncovered all manner of post-party comedown gentleness and record collection curiosities, but you’d be hard pressed to find an artist who fits the profile of the ideal <i>Late Night Tales</i> subject better than Jon Hopkins. Coming off the back of his breakthrough, 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18090-jon-hopkins-immunity/""><i>Immunity</i></a>, Hopkins is a session musician with a thoughtful approach towards techno, an inclusive attitude towards the mainstream (he’s worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2051-imogen-heap/"">Imogen Heap</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>) and a default setting that tends towards the lugubrious, all values that might as well describe the label itself.</p>
<p>Hopkins assumes the role of resident dreamweaver with all the comfort of a man slipping into his favorite pajamas. The album’s opening section is a confidently strung together sequence of shimmering pianos, arpeggiated synths, gently plucked strings, and yawning techno that culminates in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28863-nils-frahm/"">Nils Frahm</a>’s effervescent ""More"" and immediately establishes Hopkins’ touch for the featherlight. A composerly sensibility informs the rest of the mix, not only courtesy of contributions from fellow composers Frahm, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/2020029-Ben-Lukas-Boysen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ben Lukas Boysen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1968-david-holmes/"">David Holmes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27990-peter-broderick/"">Peter Broderick</a>, but also in the way Hopkins deploys solo instrumentals to close chapters and cleanse palettes. Between Boysen’s opener (""Sleepers Beat Theme""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5072-helios/"">Helios</a>’ closer (""Emancipation""), and the album’s centerpiece (Hopkins’ solo piano cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer/"">Yeasayer</a>’s ""I Remember""), <i>Late Night Tales</i> feels as neatly demarcated into three acts as any film or book.</p>
<p>In between those three pillars sits an equitable spread of current electronic (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28780-holy-other/"">Holy Other</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29245-teebs/"">Teebs</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>), folk music (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6327-alela-diane/"">Alela Diane</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4141-songs-of-green-pheasant/"">Songs of Green Pheasant</a>) and indie rock (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7374-school-of-seven-bells/"">School of Seven Bells</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5523-health/"">HEALTH</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28265-jonsi-alex/"">Jónsi &amp; Alex</a>). Hopkins moves easily between genres; like the airy music he’s selected, many of his transitions feel almost invisible. While that’s mostly a good thing, it’s easy to miss a little bit of range from this set of songs. With the exception of Letherette’s ""After Dawn""—which is pretty much the only moment that things push past third gear, and which sounds especially great in the context of so much gossamer music—there aren’t even any tiny tremors to be felt from <i>Late Night Tales</i>. In the end, though, that feels like a minor quibble in the face of such a mix; this is an inspired collection of songs, even if you do get the feeling Hopkins prefers to spend his late nights alone.</p></div>"|20239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20239-late-night-tales/|7.5|Mark Pytlik

""This is the last time I’ll be making your drinks on the house,"" she sings as the guitars float around the room like the memory of cigarette smoke. The jukebox is playing nothing but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painters</a>, which suits this barkeep just fine. ""You’ll be paying starting right now,"" is her ultimatum, but she doesn’t say it out loud. Instead, she sings it like she’s promising herself she’ll be stronger next time. Nelson strikes such a tone of dread and regret, though, that she sounds like she’s been repeating this mantra every night for months already and knows she’ll probably keep repeating it every night for months to come.</p>
<p>The fact that the freeloader sounds so self-absorbed—""Flash me a secret smile while you’re lying right to my face""—reinforces the sense of mundane tragedy and makes you sympathize more strongly with the barkeep. Nelson spent years uncapping beers and mixing drinks around San Francisco, so she’s probably writing and singing from experience. But that doesn’t matter. ""Paying"" captures the inner voice of her narrator so clearly and compassionately that the song achieves the texture of real life regardless of the backstory. We’ve all made and broken similar promises to ourselves.</p>
<p>No other song on <i>Fast-Moving Clouds</i> is quite so specific in its setting or quite so unsettled in its emotions as ""Paying"", and that’s fine. Nelson displays a sharp eye for sympathetic characters (even her romantic antagonists come across as confused rather than manipulative or mean), and she can distill an entire relationship down to a single lyric. ""You’ll pull my hair but not hold my hand,"" she sings on ""Impossible Love"", sounding like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8324-nancy-sinatra/"">Nancy Sinatra</a> fronting a garage rock group. Both naïve and knowing, that taunt only hints at the irony of a couple blessed with sexual chemistry but cursed with romantic incompatibility.</p>
<p>Because Nelson knows the difference between describing emotions and enacting them, it’s tempting to categorize <i>Fast-Moving Clouds</i> as a songwriter’s album. But that seems too limiting. This is, at least in part, a rhythm guitarist’s album, one where the notes compete with the lyrics for your attention. Working with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3953-kelley-stoltz/"">Kelley Stoltz</a> as well as a small troupe of Bay Area musicians, Nelson makes those guitars chime and sparkle on songs like the sunny-sad ""Uneasy"" and the soft-focus jam ""Every Other Sunday"". Her primary inspirations seem to be ornate '60s pop and austere '90s slowcore; that pairing of florid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">Beach Boys</a> elements and mopey <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/321-bedhead/"">Bedhead</a> ambience might seem contradictory, but Nelson makes it sound perfectly natural, each bringing out something new in the other.</p>
<p>Neither a revivalist nor a gearhead, she’s not interested in mimicking a scene or fetishizing a guitar tone. Even if a few songs—most notably, ""Snake Shake""—sound like rough sketches, <i>Fast-Moving Clouds</i> benefits immensely from its mid-fi, almost homemade sound, which lends weight to her inventive pop flourishes: the mutated go-go guitar vamp of ""Impossible Love"", the recorder and mute trumpet that voice her wild desire on ""Black Telephone"", the revving motorcycle rhythm of the title track. Nelson deploys these elements expertly, allowing them to lend epic stakes to everyday conflicts, even something as humdrum as serving that drink you told yourself you’d never mix.</p></div>"|20311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20311-sarah-bethe-nelson-fast-moving-clouds/|7.4|Stephen M.

Now the title reads as accidentally prophetic: This is likely to be the only album ever to feature members of Jethro Tull and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast"">Best Coast</a> and a guy who worked with Poco, and you have to wonder what Warner Bros. were hoping for by allowing a band like JEFF the Brotherhood to conduct their own fantasy draft. But at least their short stint in the big leagues allowed the group a shot to make good on the upward trajectory promised by 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15452-we-are-the-champions"">We Are the Champions</a></i>. Instead, <i>Wasted on the Dream</i> just skulks back to a keg that was kicked far too long ago.</p>
<p>No one should have to apologize for party rockin’, of course. But when your basic M.O. is ""we’ve got mustaches and a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lunYo16vQhg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sixer</a>,"" there’s only three ways your eighth (!) album can go.  You grow increasingly debauched until your body gives out or the authorities come calling. You discover <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements"">the Replacements</a> and start writing wistful, ruminative songs with acoustic guitars. Or you take a third path, cut by recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady"">Hold Steady</a> and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27852-free-energy/""> Free Energy</a> releases and followed by JEFF the Brotherhood here: scale back in the name of ""good, clean fun."" It’s an overreaction to any encroachment of ""I’m too old for this shit,"" countering age with enthusiasm in the hopes of perking the ears of listeners who might still get titillated at the mention of beer and weed in a radio rock song. At best, <i>Wasted on the Dream</i> is an eager, ""responsible"" parent letting the high school kids get drunk at their house because they gotta do it <i>somewhere</i>. At worst, they sorta sound like narcs.</p>
<p>Sample lyrics: ""The world has turned into a great big ball of shit."" ""Marijuana makes me wanna take off all my clothes."" There’s one song where Jake Orrall is too drunk to karaoke and many others that refer to ""the dream"" as some kind of vague vision quest guided by an unnamed hallucinogen. Quoting the lyrics at length disarms deeper criticism once you realize what you’re up against<span>—</span>it’s harmless, mostly, the sort of played-out and time-stamped easy laughs that lead one to believe the flute solo on ""Black Cherry Pie"" could’ve been inspired by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c_ufaxeSTs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ron Burgundy</a>, even if Ian Anderson actually plays the damn thing.</p>
<p><i>Wasted on the Dream</i> argues for the viability for modern classic rock and at the very least, it wants to interact with the kids rather than resort to Kid Rock-style concern trolling about the obsolescence of the <i>geetar</i>. Their generous hooks and effective riffs establish the Orralls as premiere Buzz Bin archivists,""Cosmic Visions"" somehow recalling both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a> and the one time when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins"">the Smashing Pumpkins</a> sounded like they were having fun, which is to say it’s a major bite of ""Where Boys Fear to Tread"". They’re an able stand-in for fellow alt-grunge torchbearer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"">Wavves</a> on the Bethany Cosentino feature ""In My Dreams"", and their stoner-rock allegiances are confined to ""Melting Place"", which manages to recall ""Black Sabbath"", ""Iron Man"", ""Paranoid"" and JEFF's single-entendre spirit guide, ""Sweet Leaf"", the four Black Sabbath songs known by even the most casual fans.</p>
<p>It's all crunchy and cloying and probably better if you're high, but that just makes <i>Wasted on the Dream </i>something like a store-brand version of your favorite cereal; it's close, but not <i>there, </i>usually a matter of texture and feel. Despite doubling their number of guitar strings from three to six and their live personnel to a quartet, <i>Wasted on the Dream</i> is a buzzless, antiseptic recording, with hotshot producer Joe Chiccarelli (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">The Strokes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon/"">Spoon</a>, Jason Mraz, it just gets weirder) spraying Febreze all over the room.  Or, there just isn't an established character selling it to you, no way to ascertain a discernible <i>JEFF the Brotherhood-ness </i>through it all. But maybe that's just as well for an act that always felt destined not to be America's preeminent party-rock band, but a <i>pre-party</i> band—surely fun, but a warmup for something bigger and more memorable.</p></div>"|20320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20320-wasted-on-the-dream/|5.2|Ian Cohen
