Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. Yes, empty gestures and idiocy abound, so it makes sense that a smart guy like Static would call bullshit. Still, there's a danger in getting boxed in by sheer negation, and for the overwhelming majority of <em>In the Meantime</em>, the Chicago emcee sounds like nothing so much as a man without a home.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Static is particularly fond of the kind of buzzing, metallic beats that instantly signify a grouchily dystopian outlook to anyone who's ever owned a Def Jux record. Almost everything on this half-hour platter-- proper songs and periodic instrumental interludes-- leers with disjointed rhythms and spare clatter. There's even a track of eggheaded sociological pedantry, ""Of Prophets and People"", from a dude who already sounds a good bit like Mr. Lif anyway-- complete with herky-jerky sub-Autechre beat work!</p><p>Fortunately, most of Static's lyrical artistry is reserved for pure misanthropy, and if rappers, bloggers, and hipsters need someone (else) to write a version of ""Radio, Radio"" just for them, he's certainly not a bad man for the job. ""Internet Superstar"" is a relatively predictable but still spot-on piece of musical pwnage, earning points for castigating the chickenshit racism of the modern-day message board and, admittedly, making nice with a requisite lolcat reference as well. More strangely and memorably, the succeeding ""Man Up"" finds Static aiming his ire at indie dudes who wear women's jeans, expressing stupefied disdain at the concept of ""Cutting off blood to your package/ Just to get some action."" And lest it be said that Static's only conveys contempt for the subcultural habits of white people and isn't an agent for change, there's the helpfully individualized ""Hates on a Plane"", a wicked little narrative wherein our hero serves up rough sexual justice to a belligerent fellow airways traveler. Erring on the truly funny side of mean with lines like ""You got on tight pants but one titty's bigger than the other,"" Static proves himself a worthy contemporary of down-to-earth, grown-man shit-talkers like Murs and Rhymefest.</p>
<p>Like those rappers, he'll probably be underrated largely because he occupies an uneasy middle ground in the hip-hop landscape, failing to exhibit enough of the righteous piety expected of the underground's saviors while lacking the pop appeal to cross over. Perhaps this reality has something to do with why Kid Static is most complicatedly aggrieved over hip-hop itself. Wasting no time on ""Rappin N Shit"" in claiming ""I don't battle,"" Static proceeds to state that ""if you're the emperor of this rap shit then I'm Brutus,"" before very deftly poking fun at hip-hop's nagging self-reflexive tendencies with the refrain ""Picture me rappin' about rappin' 'n shit."" ""I Identify"" threatens at first to be another acid bath with its opening aside of ""stereotypical yo"" followed by Static's mocking boast that ""Everything's a freestyle/ I got bitches.""</p>
<p>Then a funny thing happens, and just before the end of this 30-minute pisstake Static actually opens up a little bit about ""growing up in Illinois,"" and even in the midst of a groaning joke about Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes finds cause to confess ""This rap shit is the best trip."" Hopefully this fleeting moment of positivity won't prove to be too contagious-- Static has potential to be just the kind of self-aware cynic a frequently over-reverential art form like hip-hop always needs.</p></div>"|11618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11618-in-the-meantime/|7.1|Joshua Love

Then again, just as the two- or three-minute songs from Jay Reatard feel epic, he's given his fans a near-career's worth of riches in that time. It's true that nearly one-third of these tracks are demos and alternate versions of songs from 2006's <em>Blood Visions</em>, but he hasn't rested on his laurels for one moment since then. This compilation is beyond helpful for collecting so many one-off singles, and actually makes for an excellent intro into the world of Reatard for the uninitiated. <br/><br/>Anyone who's caught Jay Lindsey and his band live over the past year or so has probably heard ""Night of Broken Glass"": It's a simple but effective juxtaposition that sums up Lindsey's reference points fairly well, from the Devo-brand jerkiness of the verse into one of his most breathless punk-rock choruses. (It speaks to the man's casual approach to history to have what sounds like an empathetic warning song from a guy whose last side project was named the Final Solutions.) Those only familiar with <em>Blood Visions</em> may be surprised by the other tracks from the <em>Night of Broken Glass</em> EP. ""Another Person"" has perky carnival keyboards, stiff new-wave affectations, and sophisticated self-harmonizing, while the foreboding lyrics in ""All Over Again"" are betrayed by a swinging and sweet backing track without a flying-V guitar in sight.<br/><br/>""I Know a Place"" and its B-side, ""Don't Let Him Come Back"", are just as disarmingly gentle, but it further speaks to a songwriter steeped in punk traditions who's absorbed a lot more than his album covers might suggest-- not in the least bands like the Go-Betweens, who originally recorded the deep cut ""Don't Let Him Come Back"" in 1979, with Reatard following suit after Grant McLennan's had passed in 2006. It's a faithful, acoustically driven version marked by Reatard's hiss-soaked multi-tracked vocals, making his lonely yelp into a basement chorus line.<br/><br/>""Hammer I Miss You"" is slow and loopy power-pop that struts rather than races, with a great faraway wail and a guitar part like a downhill snowball for the chorus. But between the staccato full stops of ""All Wasted"" and the screeching vocal of ""It's So Useless"", its B-sides might do the best job of reconciling his former, younger fury with his just-slightly slower punk-pop of late. ""In the Dark"" is one of Reatard's most explicit Wire nods, though it's mid-tempo beat is still infectiously urgent, the single for which also featured two sluggish lo-fi demos of what would be two <em>Blood Visions</em> stand outs, ""Searching For You""  and ""Haunting You"" (which would be renamed ""Nightmares"" and Fading All Away"", respectively-- the promo we reviewed inverted the titles, but both demos are clearly named from key lyrics in each.) Here, they seem to sink underneath the melodrama of the broken relationship they detail; ""Searching for You"" holds up, as it's an uncharacteristically wistful song for Reatard, while ""Haunting You"" doesn't fare as well-- hearing a lyric like ""I won't stop until you're dead"" isn't quite the same without the clattering engine of the band behind it.<br/><br/>Those unexpected quirks are more evident on the ""Blood Demos"" 7"" released on Stained Circles. The title track is just as biting as its album counterpart, but its chorus melody is more static and the transition between it and the verses much less smooth, while the juxtaposition of the sterile verses to the careening chorus of ""Turning Blue"" was sacrificed for a more manic and more streamlined approach on the record. That said, there's still something happening here; a sense of melody and purpose that still lifts them above the other exemplary singles from <em>Blood Visions</em>. Letting the seams show a bit with these demos not only reveals a bit about his process, but it illuminates the link between his earlier career and his recent breakthrough, while going a long way to prove that record was more than three or four chords and a fake accent.<br/><br/>Song for song, <em>Blood Visions</em> might still outclass this compilation (though this is certainly more diverse), but again, mind those dates at the top: In this short span of time Reatard cranked out more memorable songs then some acts do in their whole careers. If there's a creeping criticism to be had, it's that Jay Reatard solo songs always sound like Jay Reatard, be they slow or fast, quiet or loud, played on synths or guitars. It's a fine line between consistency and stasis that he's toeing, and something to bear in mind as he continues as he continues to record for Matador. For a songwriter hitting this kind of unstoppable stride over the past two years, however, it's a moot point. Whether you watch that DVD or not, it's an era worth celebrating.</p></div>"|11952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11952-singles-06-07/|8.1|Jason Crock

The Swedes aren't much on inspiration, these metaphors (tritely) suggested, but boy are they good at turning others' ideas into safe, efficient, everyday-luxury items. Gothenburg, Sweden's Girlfrendo, whose members would eventually form Love Is All, played Bis- and Kenickie-esque twee-pop almost deserving of the usual Swedish-pop faint praise, but at their best they brought uncommon charm to the role of the lonesome square.</p><p>When Love Is All arrived, frazzled and frenzied, with 2006's <em>Nine Times That Same Song</em>, they certainly had their precursors-- Life Without Buildings, X-Ray Spex, half of the K Records roster-- but girl-group music had never sounded quite as, for lack of a newer word, <em>punk</em> as it did through that lo-fi looking-glass smudge. Unfortunately, less of what makes Love Is All more than just another stylish yet inexpensive bedroom set could be heard earlier this year on remix compilation <em>Mixed Up</em>, where the same songs that once made us dance, swoon, and spazz out now too many times went nowhere like so much furniture. On their U.S. tour earlier this month, Love Is All started selling a five-song covers CD-R. If <em>Mixed Up</em> had Love Is All's songs hooking up with other artists' styles, the new <em>Wishing Well + 5</em> EP-- eMusic's variation on the tour CD-R, with a slightly altered track list-- marries the Love Is All style to other people's tunes.</p><p>The results confirm not only that there is such a thing as a ""Love Is All style,"" but also that, given the right material, it can be a great look. ""Wishing Well"", the disc's opener and sole original track, bodes well for Love Is All's forthcoming sophomore album, expected next year. Like recently posted MySpace demo ""New Beginnings"", this one puts handclaps and male backing vocals behind Josephine Olausson's romantically challenged yips and cries, here perkily bemoaning the futility of superstitions. Like the rest of the tracks on the EP, it was apparently recorded live at practice, which suits this group just fine.</p>
<p>Love Is All's din still has within it that Girlfrendo delicacy, and a precarious balance between the two keeps their performances sounding as if they could at any moment go careening into the abyss-- be too cute, too skronky, too much. A cover of the Pastels' ""Nothing to Be Done"" teeters exquisitely on this brink, mussing up the jangle-pop classic with frantic disco hi-hats, honking sax, and a red-lining vocal duet by Olausson and guitarist Nicholaus Sparding. It takes fewer changes than you might think to fill A Flock of Seagulls' glossy new-wave classic ""I Ran (So Far Away)"" with <em>Nine Times</em>' drunken frustration. That same feeling comes across more clearly in a rollicking cover of moddish obscurity ""Fucking Hell"", called ""Golly Gosh"" on the actual CD-R (The original is by Jed Dmochowksi, a UK singer/guitarist who recorded for Television Personalities mainstay Dan Treacy's Whaam! label in the early 1980s).</p>
<p>When Love Is All stray further from material that lets them be equal parts Karen O and Aleksandra Campesinos!, the nervous giddiness subsides. They slow down on a cover of Dire Straits' ""So Far Away"", replacing the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> version's palm-muted power chords and Dylan-for-MTV gruffness with sax-led  languor, but they'd have been better off fucking up Carole King. ""Kung Fu on the Internet"", salvaged from Glaswegian post-riot-grrl group Lung Leg's 1997 <em>Maid to Minx</em>, is a little too close already to Love Is All's busy-doing-nothing approach; they can obliterate original's ""Batman""-esque riffs, but they can't add the ""emotional content"" the song complains about.</p>
<p>Sure, the <em>Wishing Well + 5</em> EP could've been more interesting if it were <em>+ 7</em>, but the ratio of pluses to minuses wouldn't much change. Love Is All's writhing, thrashing ""Darling Nikki""-- on the CD-R but left off the official release, because, well it's a Prince song-- couldn't possibly improve on the <em>Purple Rain</em> hit, so it gets downer and dirtier. An unreleased cover of Faith No More's rap-metal-predicting 1989 smash ""Epic"", is a curio-- a reminder that the original had a <em>Pretty Hate Machine</em>-sized hook and that the Strokes trump Mike Patton when it comes to streching the word ""it"" beyond all meaning. Though ""Darling Nikki"" would've been the EP's chaotic, um, climax, the exclusion of these two tracks doesn't change what <em>Wishing Well + 5</em> is: a confident lark from a band for whom love is just the start (and pop is nothing like a day at some far-flung furniture warehouse).</p></div>"|11955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11955-wishing-well-5-ep/|6.4|Marc Hogan

It was both boring and efficient electric folk music, allergic to fuss and incapable of breaking a sweat. So what the hell happened? Drums were never, ever the point. Yet here they are, playing an integral (central?) role on the Brooklyn duo's follow-up, <em>Too Old to Die Young</em>, a record that growls where its predecessor purred, unsettles where it soothed, and generally does whatever it can to make more racket. So this is what the volume knob's for, huh? <br/> <br/> Of course, adding a force behind the kit can do that to a band. And journeyman Ryan Sawyer has been around the block-- with decibel-adorers like At the Drive In, Celebration, TV on the Radio, Stars Like Fleas, and earplugged into the 62 spot on the Boredoms 77 Boadrum plot. Faced with a résumé like that, what were Mullan and Mies to do but brawn up their yawny folk? So here they are, recasting themselves as a rangy rock band. With feedback and everything. But does it serve them well?  <br/> <br/> On occasion. In the place of Tall Firs' dreary hush, <em>Too Old</em> offers tracks like the adamant lead-single ""So Messed Up"", and the Pavement blotter ""Hairdo"", where Sawyer turns his band into a crew of galvanized indie rockers-- a strange look for a couple of saddos who were supping codeine last time out. But the energy is far from unbecoming, bringing Mullan and Mies out of a self-imposed coma with a couple more BPMs. Then there's ""Warriors"", where the Firs gets downright skin-crazed and wild. Toms patter and cymbals rattle while the guitars do what we never dreamt they could: stir themselves into a mini-furor.  <br/> <br/> But Sawyer's work is a distraction when the songwriters long for their old template. Both ""Hippies"" and ""Blue in the Dark"" are caught between worlds, with warm guitar lines that wouldn't sound out of place on the debut, but with drums that beg to be matched and cathartic outros that come too little, too late. Indeed, the hallmark of this record is a disjointed sort of dynamism, a frustrating lack of cohesion indicative of a band that's still feeling itself out. After all, Sawyer's entree is a game changer. Before, Tall Firs might as well have been Mullan or Mies' solo project, dudes with guitars playing self-contained songs and sounding half asleep. Now, uneven or not, the songs seem to breathe on their own, benefiting from a shot of rhythm and a healthy sweat.</p></div>"|11956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11956-too-old-to-die-young/|5.8|Robbie Mackey

This happens most often with critics, but there are understandably plenty of dilettante fans who only want to hear the most innovative, top-tier acts. It's a situation that keeps some great bands from getting great press and, in some cases, drives some of those cream-of-the-crop bands to distraction. It's a trap that Modey Lemon have fallen into: being an above-average garage-rock band from their debut up through <em>Thunder + Lightning</em> somehow wasn't enough. 2005's <em>The Curious City</em> added many psychedelic touches and ADHD song suites to their overall sound, and while they'd grown pretty far from their spirited beginnings, they managed to grow up with grace. <em>The Curious City</em> would have been a great album for them to ride off into the sunset on-- and after the three years of silence that followed, I'd assumed they had.</p><p>While the band's return from their hiatus is welcomed, <em>Season of Sweets</em> presents what would have made for a fine batch of rough-and-ready rock songs that the band should be used to cranking out, were they not weighed down by their grander ambitions. The proto-metal riff of ""The Bear Comes Back Down the Mountain"" is anchored by a purple synth-bass gurgle, and the rest of the record rolls forward on an impressive low-end rumble. The song nods to the psychedelia they dabbled with on <em>Curious City</em>, but adapted into their own more economical and familiar style. Yet its simple melody is stretched a bit thin over its five-minute duration, which sets the tone for this often loose, occasionally plodding batch of tunes. The dropped-note swing of ""The Peacock's Eye"" loses much of its momentum during a half-hearted instrumental interlude, and even the sugary chorus of ""It Made You Dumb"" grows tired the third time around. The drumming is inventive and buoyant throughout, but it would need to be-- even with the addition of Jason Kirker on bass, leaving Phil Boyd to Moog and guitar, the frequent instrumental breaks are often aimless. There's an appropriately icy guitar tone and the rattle of snare taps on ""Ice Fields"", though the vocoder and siren noises are superfluous details. This track and many others are close to the syrupy vintage psyche of their labelmates and buddies in Apes, though not nearly as thorough or convincing in their psychedelic nods.</p><p>While I'm not one to complain over someone taking a page from Oneida, the searing guitars and frantic organ riff of ""Milk Moustache"" is one of the few moments on the album where the band kicks up any dust. To be fair, most of these moments fall at the end of <em>Season of Sweets</em>, making for a record with a long, patient build rather than the usual peaks and valleys of standard album pacing. The title track takes off from that momentum with under three minutes of relentless drumming and a guitar part that's more squall than actual notes, yet with all its swagger it remains as sweetly melodic as its namesake. ""Live Like Kids"" is a 10-minute finale-- naturally-- and while its melody is static, they build tension gracefully and purposefully when given the space. As for the tracks preceding it, however, they seem to split the difference between adventurous and cathartic, reaching a middle ground that appeases neither end of the spectrum. It wasn't too long ago that the Modey Lemon had amassed unexpected confidence, but <em>Season of Sweets</em> sounds like a band still in transition.</p></div>"|11954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11954-season-of-sweets/|5.8|Jason Crock

On previous outings, Mr. Battle of Who Could     Care Less (can't believe Brian Howe used ""Brick""-layer before I had a chance     to) and Son, Ambulance's Joe Knapp were namedropped in an approximate 1:1.5 ratio, but not only     has Knapp given us nearly four years to dig up different piano man comparisons,     he's pretty much ditched the ivories altogether.  But even if one of Saddle Creek's most quietly     ambitious artists is flying without a net, it's hard to call it thrilling,     since Knapp forsook that adjective when he punned on his band name.  Which just gives us another easy way out     while dealing with Son, Ambulance's third LP, which is intermittently fluid and     challenging in its arrangements and occasionally gorgeous-- but a lot of times,     it just feels like you can't possibly finish it in a wakeful state.</p><p>For the first couple of listens, Knapp's willingness     to play dress up carries the day.  ""A     Girl in New York City"" is a bit tough to trace lyrically, but it does an     admirable job capturing the essence of its saucer-eyed title character, reflecting     all sorts of wonder and culture-vulture consumption in its constantly morphing,     light-loafered samba arrangement; the brief forays into buzzy guitar soloing     even brings to mind <em>Hissing of Summer     Lawns</em>-era Joni Mitchell, before the fever-dreamy ""Legend of Lizeth"" takes a     soak in Canterbury Calgon.  But Son,     Ambulance is too laidback to be out of a comfort zone for long, and the wafting     major chords of ""Quand Tu Marches Seul"" finds ""technically proficient Piano Magic"" and     ""heavily narcotized Dears"" as the borders.</p><p>What ties all of it together is Knapp's modest everydude     voice, which rarely is intrusive but even more rarely sounds like it's     operating from a position of strength.  ""Wild     Roses"" goes for a real-talk romance in the manner of ""Something"" (down to the     George Harrison-worshipping guitar solo), but it's more suited for ""Nashville Star""     where an appropriately outsized voice can realistically compete with the     beyond-shlocky lyrics (""You can take her out dancing/ Spend all night drinking     beer"") and gooey instrumentation-- Knapp tries to kick things up with an     ill-fitting backwards echo effect that sounds like his larynx getting shredded.     But he also lacks the grit that could     sell the rootsier material- the hangover balladry of ""Yesterday Morning"" simply     stews when it's trying to simmer, and it's not so much an anchor as an     albatross-- there are points where you wonder if it's ever going to end.</p>
<p>Occasionally, <em>Someone     Else's Déjà Vu </em>is focused enough to be effective-- the off-time strums of ""Horizons""     manages to kickstart an otherwise terribly drowsy midsection, while ""Juliet's     Son"" provides the most luminous passage through gauzy, low-key harmonies despite     the words not really hitting like they should.      But such concision is a rare find on a record that Knapp likely     considers to be his <em>Lifted</em>, an     Americana feeding frenzy that considers its sprawl as much of an end as the     means.  But more than any pedal steel     touch or straight-shooter lyric, what made that record is something sorely     lacking here, namely being young and full of shit enough to see limitations as     hurdles instead of ceilings.  The proof's     in the title: <em>Someone Else's Déjà Vu</em> would've benefitted from Knapp making a stronger claim of ownership to his     lofty visions.</p></div>"|11957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11957-someone-elses-deja-vu/|5.4|Ian Cohen

These days bootlegs-- particularly bootlegs like Bowie's October 1972 gig in Santa Monica, which enjoy a degree of fan reputation-- aren't the enemy, they're a blessed revenue stream. <em>Santa Monica '72</em> has had some level of official release before, but this version is repackaged and unlimited: An opportunity for casual fans to experience what is supposedly the best Bowie show on record.<br/> <br/> The obvious comparison for <em>Santa Monica '72</em> is <em>Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture</em>: same tour, but a very different document. That album is David Bowie returning to Britain as a conquering hero (and stunning his fans with his apparent retirement)-- this one finds him far from home and still feeling his way into stardom. The Ziggy look and concept-- the jumpsuit, the shock of red hair, the sci-fi glam rock-- had kicked doors open for Bowie in England, but its impact in the USA hadn't been quite so great. <em>Santa Monica '72</em> is the sound of a cult act pushing hard for breakout success.<br/> <br/> Bowie had two big advantages in this push: An exceptional backing band in the Spiders from Mars, and four albums worth of very different material to draw on. The combination let him put on a show that could build and twist to keep its audience riveted. If you're familiar with <em>Motion Picture</em>, you'll know that its slow songs get rather lost in the general end-of-tour bombast, with Mike Garson's piano especially suffering. On <em>Santa Monica '72</em>, though, Garson sounds as intimate and effective as any Spider on a mid-set semi-acoustic section that forms the record's slow-burning highlight.<br/> <br/> Before that the Spiders set their stall out with a brisk ""Hang on to Yourself"" and a snarling ""Ziggy Stardust"". But ""The Supermen""-- Bowie's unearthly vision of future gods-- is where this album really starts to smolder. The bridge into the show's quieter phase, it's stronger and stranger here than on <em>The Man Who Sold the World</em>, with Bowie's disturbing images and Mick Ronson's blurts of caveman guitar playing compellingly off each other. ""The Supermen"" conjures a sense of uncanny menace that carries the singer through intense takes on ""Five Years"" and ""Life on Mars?"", and ensures ""Space Oddity"" retains some power even when Bowie's doing the take-off noises himself. ""Andy Warhol"" is a standout, closing with a hushed, creepy solo, after which Bowie decides to tell an incomprehensible story about a lobster and a palm tree. The crowd and singer laugh nervously: It's endearing, given Bowie's reputation as a showman and manipulator, how gauche all his stage patter on this disc sounds.<br/> <br/> Bowie's in-song confidence and command, though, is impeccable. Art-rock credentials proven after a 10-minute ""Width of a Circle"", the show's second half is a thrilling space glam rave-up, the kind that sparked Bowie's early fame. Ronson is very much an equal partner, keeping ""Queen Bitch"" and ""John, I'm Only Dancing"" savage while Bowie brings out their catty catchiness. His guitar lines on ""Moonage Daydream"" prowl all over the song, rescuing it from some deeply unconvincing backing vocals.<br/> <br/> Not everything Bowie tries on <em>Santa Monica</em> works-- I've never liked his overwrought reading of Jacques Brel's ""My Death"" and even this relatively subdued take doesn't change my mind. And his take on the Velvet Underground's ""Waiting for the Man""-- one of the set's rarities-- is too mannered. But the blistering closing tracks chase doubts from your mind. A fierce ""Suffragette City"" sounds more like the Turbonegro version than the Ziggy one, and the freshly-written ""Jean Genie"" is a revelation, sharp and wide-eyed pop rather than the rote glam exercise it became on record. After an hour's roaming through Bowie's early catalogue, he and the Spiders sound giddy with confidence, up for anything.<br/> <br/> With bootlegs there's often a danger of confusing rarity with quality: whispered fan legends can wither when exposed to commercial sunlight. But as the man says, the beat it comes out better on a stolen guitar, and <em>Santa Monica '72</em> earns its fan reputation. This is at once a snapshot of a hungry group on terrific form, and a fascinating look at an emergent star.</p></div>"|11947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11947-live-santa-monica-72/|7.7|Tom Ewing

He won the DMC World DJ Championships in 1997, at the age of 15, and he would go on to DJ for Kanye West at the height of his fame. He turned down an opportunity to DJ for Jay-Z <em>on principle</em>, out of loyalty to Kanye (although he would agree to handle musical direction for Hova's tour-- having cake, meet eating cake).</p><p>Nike's been pretty shrewd in selecting timely, suitable artists for its <em>Nike+ Original Run</em> series, which features continuous mixes designed for exercise, so it's not surprising that they've turned to A-Trak for their latest. Nor is it surprising that his contribution to the series features the same steel-wheel virtuosity, slippery micro-cuts, acrobatic beat shuffling, and block-party swagger that made his <em>Dirty South Dance</em> LP such a blast.</p><p>What is mildly surprising is that A-Trak regards this as his debut album (he says so twice on the Fool's Gold label website) rather than a one-off thing, which creates some unreasonable expectations for it. A lifestyle accessory with corporately mandated demands (Nike, quite sensibly, dictates the structure and pace of mixes in the series to conform to the physiology of a runner) can't be the kind of balls-out creative manifesto we want from a long-awaited debut.</p>
<p>A-Trak's mix essentially includes five distinct movements. After a calling-card warm-up, the beat drops and we get into ""Say Woah"", where a fat, fuzzy caterpillar of a bass line, needling funk guitars, and a hype man's call-and-response get our blood pumping. It ramps up fast: When A-Trak starts slicing up the vocal sample after a brief edit, it's like we've gone straight from mild stretches to full-tilt step aerobics. As the discrete elements of ""Say Woah"" get spliced and juggled with typical dexterity, the pinging Euro techno of the second movement washes in and gets syncopated with squelchy flecks, bass grenades, rubbery rumble-strip synths, and 808 claps.</p>
<p>The third section is a slinky, mid-tempo cool-down, with gusts of noir-ish synthetic strings and serviceable club-rap by Fool's Gold artist Kid Cudi (there's a leaked snippet with Lupe Fiasco on the track, but apparently Lupe couldn't be cleared, which perhaps explains why a guy you've probably never heard of says he misses the days when he could walk around in public). Movement four is total choogle, with A-Trak grinding hard on strobe-light synth sequences and revved up splashes of countermelody, and five brings us to an arpeggio-happy finish line. If this sounds all over the place, it kind of is. Maybe it's weird that A-Trak's original productions feel less cohesive than his cuts of other records-- we'll have to wait for an unmediated LP before we can say for sure whether this scattershot feeling is intrinsic to his original work or specific to this project.</p>
<p>As far as the whole running thing goes: I ventured out into this hundred-degree summer to give it a shot. It worked fine until the tense yet kinda sluggish Kid Cudi section-- I tried running in slow motion, but it's hard, and the neighbors look at you with pity. So instead of finishing, I had a nice wheat beer with lemon on the porch. I'd like to blame A-Trak, Kid Cudi, Nike-- anyone but myself-- for my truncated run, but that would be unfair, like getting pissed off at MF Doom when you listen to his music and discover you still can't shoot lasers out of your eyes.</p></div>"|11953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11953-running-man-nike-original-run/|6.5|Brian Howe

This new DFA ""group"" (see how that works?) doesn't submit to interviews, perform live, manifest any Google results unrelated to Syclops, show up on film, have fingerprints or dental records, etc. Fulton's penchant for relative anonymity explains why a guy who's done remixes and production for Annie, Hot Chip, and Kathy Diamond, and whom is half of Mu, can keep such a low profile. Put it this way: Syclops features the Tin Man on keyboards, the Cowardly Lion on bass, and the Scarecrow on drums, with Maurice Fulton as the Wizard of Sheffield. Pay particular attention to the man behind the curtain.</p><p>And anyway, who cares about biographical shenanigans when we finally get what's ostensibly a proper solo album from Fulton? If he needs to be left alone to make music this good, we should let him be. <em>I've Got My Eye on You</em> (rim-shot optional) is DFA's second direct-hit entrance this year, a contemplative counterpoint to Hercules and Love Affair's flamboyant debut. The clinically exact robo-funk of early single ""Where's Jason's K"" was almost too polished for its own good, but luckily, the acidy B-side ""Monkey Puss"" (which isn't featured here) turns out to be a better representation of the album proper: It's visceral and lyrical, thumping as jaggedly as a distressed cardio patient's EKG. </p><p>We might not get ""Monkey Puss"" on <em>I've Got My Eye on You</em>, but we do get ""The Fly"", which features the same kind of strident, Morse code melody, artfully stuttering and ghosting out, interpolated by overdriven bass. It's a bit like French producer Vitalic's jaw-clenching vigor, but where the latter tends to plow down the center, Syclops utilizes every minute degree of stereo channel space. Opening track ""NR17"" traces a labyrinth of pitched percussion and barely audible sub-tones through your headphones, as flying saucers circle ominously; one imagines that Fulton's studio comes equipped with a protractor, compass, and tinfoil hat.</p>
<p>These extreme but seamless contrasts-- of physical and synthetic sound sources, hectic and placid moods, tricky and candid patterns-- typify the album. The loping ""5 Out"" splashes sprightly lounge piano over clipped vocal samples and sawtooth synth waves. On ""The E Ticket"", shaggy jazz drums launch a bass workout flecked with crystalline arpeggios and periodic synth washes. ""Mom, the Video Broke"" is sort of a mirror image of ""The E Ticket""-- the latter starts off tight and gradually widens like a cone; the former turns its jazzy percussion into jackhammering mechanical drums as the elongated synth-bass riffs move through fiddly variations. The title track's reverb-brushed percussion verges on musique concrète, at stark odds with the celestial fluff drifting around it, and ""Naoka's F"", with chords radiating through a vast array of torqued pings, chirrs, and blips, feels like the view from an airport's moving walkway-- a respite from harried striding, as busy scenery rolls tranquilly by. </p>
<p>Overall, <em>I've Got My Eye on You</em> is the sound of preternatural studio expertise being pressed into the service of the listener's delight. The delicate melodic structures and decorative rhythmic patterns seem to want to please us, rather than just impress us. This befits someone who goes to such lengths to isolate his name and ego from his music, and results in a lot of terrific moments, like when the hushed ambiance of ""A Lovely Sunday"" suddenly lights up with surprising but weirdly apt G-funk whistles. Fulton's bio remains shrouded, but this album tells us that he's a generous and kind of crazily brilliant producer, which is all we really need to know.</p></div>"|11951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11951-ive-got-my-eye-on-you/|8.2|Brian Howe

""Bring us a virus, unite us in irrational fear/ Bring us a     mandate and some band-aids and a six-pack of beer."" Kent Lambert sings those     lines on the title track to Roommate's sophomore album, <em>We Were Enchanted</em>. A few tracks later, on ""New Steam"", he invokes     the muses, ""Newsman, sing me the blues, man."" In addition to these ostensible     references to SARS and Fox News, Lambert also invokes violent video games,     haunted McMansions, fluorescent supermarkets, and ""constitutional abuses,"" striving for an of-the-moment gravity that will reflect the dystopia     suburban America     has become. <em>We Were Enchanted</em> is     almost baroque in its topicality, but topicality is easy to achieve. Much     harder is knowing what to do with it once you're there.</p><p>Lambert hoists the same end-of-days anxiety that fueled Don     DeLillo's 1985 novel <em>White Noise</em> and     Godspeed You! Black Emperor's 1998 debut <em>F#A#</em>∞. We've heard the world end this way before, but at the very     least, this type of statement album gives the group's expanded line-up a lot to     do. On Roommate's 2006 debut, <em>Songs the     Animals Taught Us</em>, Lambert played most of the instruments himself, but has     since recruited a community of roomies to flesh these songs out with a mix of     live instrumentation, drum loops, programmed sounds, and weird shit. They give     these songs range: With traces of Ennio Morricone, Jack Nitzsche, Philip Glass,     and Pink Floyd-via-Secret Machines, <em>We     Were Enchanted</em> sounds more like science fiction-- specifically the     zero-gravity prog-rock of <em>Heavy Metal</em>-- than     literary fiction or apocalypse rock.</p><p>That's not such a bad thing, but the music does have to     carry what little heft the album has. ""Day After"" opens <em>We Were Enchanted</em> with a clattering of what the liner notes say are     ""canjos"" (and which the press release says were made by Chicago     high school students). It's an unsettling sound, promising to usher listeners     into a strange, threatening world. Sure enough, these songs sprawl and bend     themselves into odd shapes. The title track dissolves into an unexpected     ""Tubular Bells"" interlude, a brief respite that seems more unsettling than the     cacophony around it, at least until Lambert breaks the spell singing, ""Funny     monkey, come haunt us again."" On ""Tea Leaves"", a stand-out, the band     establishes a Beach Boys pop melody, then deconstruct it in a clatter of drums,     guitar, and ""gameboy programming."" Justin Petertil's guitar menaces throughout     the album, dogging Lambert's vocals on ""Way Out"" and soloing on ""Last Dreams of     Summer"", but generally, the musicians band together like a last-days cult,     especially on the sing-along ""Night"", which sounds like the Polyphonic Spree at     a funeral. Musically, there are moments of real dread, but the     songwriting-- studiously abstract, yet as sensationalized as the blues-singing     newsmen-- leavens rather than intensifies that terror. <em>We Were Enchanted</em> makes a whimper, not a bang.</p></div>"|11949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11949-we-were-enchanted/|4.8|Stephen M.

Yet, as much     as he seems more attuned to these warped beats, droning guitars, and scribbled     synths, he sounds uncomfortable on the glammy ""Radio Euphoria"" and the     faux-angry ""I Come Down"".</p>
<p>For Arthur, working in the EP format might have been a means     to jumpstart his creativity, to think outside his album-a-year box, but there's     actually very little experimentation on these songs-- nor much we haven't heard     before.

<p>By the fourth EP, <em>Foreign     Girls</em>, Arthur sounds as exhausted as, no doubt, the listener. These songs     are almost impressive in their sparkling inconsequentiality. ""Everybody loves     foreign girls,"" we're told on ""Foreign Girls"". ""Everybody wants foreign girls.""     ""Stay"" seems to exist only for the synth belches on its chorus, ""New     Satisfaction"" for its slowed-down psych-rock organ riff. Good elements, but     with little underpinning beneath them. Yet the spare arrangement of ""Lovely     Cost""-- just voice, guitar, and piano-- sounds genuinely off the cuff, as if Arthur     went from idea to execution in the span of a short spring afternoon.

That tally doesn't even take into     account his work as a visual artist working in both photography and painting     (collected at his new website Museum of Modern <span class=""nfakPe"">Arthur</span>).     Arthur's relentless output-- likely to outstrip the parameters of the word     prolific by year's end-- often seems like an outgrowth of his cultivated     eccentricity, but there are deep contradictions embedded in his method:     Certainly he controls his output completely, as he owns his own label, but his     prodigious production implies something more akin to an assembly-line approach     to creativity rather than an artist's careful self-editing.     Furthermore, flooding the marketplace only dilutes the impact of the work, and     in this case listening threatens to become more of an obligation than a     pleasure.</p><p>A deeply idiosyncratic artist, Arthur is nevertheless not an     especially innovative singer or songwriter, certainly less so now than earlier     in his career, when he was messing with loops and delays, a one-man band     creating a strange and provocative racket. There's very little racket on <em>Could We Survive</em>, to its considerable     disservice. Tasteful yet never intrusive-- in other words, a bit dull-- the     first of these four EPs portrays Arthur as a troubadour-poet musing briefly on     life during wartime. With its military snare rolls and Dylan harmonica, the     soldier's-eye-view ""Rages of Babylon"" manages to be anti-war, pro-troops, and     not a little obvious. His stilted imagery and slightly detached vocals often     conflict with the everyman perspective he's attempting to capture, suggesting     an artist too far removed from his subject. At least ""Morning Cup"", bolstered     by a delicate mandolin phrase, sounds suitably conflicted, suggesting a hopefulness     that's all the more poignant for being so precarious.</p><p><em>Crazy Rain</em> is more     animated, more of a mess, and all the better for it. This is Arthur rocking out     with mostly compelling weirdness: ""Killer's Knife"" is all filtered vocals and     distorted guitars, ""Nothin' 2 Hide"" all brooding beats and <em>Shaft</em> guitar, yet they're both compelling in their surface     pleasures alone, especially after the gravity of <em>Could We Survive. </em>On ""I Wanna Get You Alone"", he shows off a     Princely falsetto, nearly inhuman and barely recognizable against the Twilight     Singers-style backdrop (a few of that band's members, including Greg Dulli,     appear on <em>Crazy Rain</em>). Yet, as much     as he seems more attuned to these warped beats, droning guitars, and scribbled     synths, he sounds uncomfortable on the glammy ""Radio Euphoria"" and the     faux-angry ""I Come Down"".</p>
<p>For Arthur, working in the EP format might have been a means     to jumpstart his creativity, to think outside his album-a-year box, but there's     actually very little experimentation on these songs-- nor much we haven't heard     before. Instead, the tactic seems to have reinforced some of his bad habits,     such as equating brashness with innovation and using phrases like ""the     spaceship in my mind."" The third EP,<em> Vagabond     Skies,</em> mixes elements of <em>Could We     Survive</em> and <em>Crazy Rain</em>, but not     necessarily the good ones. These quiet, electrified songs sound pleasant     enough, but indistinctive. Only ""She Paints Me Gold"" and ""Second Sight"" stand     out-- and not in a good way-- the former because it features a long, pointless     guitar solo (reminiscent of last year's fiasco <em>Let's Just Be</em>) and the latter because it volleys self-consciously     between unremarkable verses and shrill, shouted choruses.</p>
<p>By the fourth EP, <em>Foreign     Girls</em>, Arthur sounds as exhausted as, no doubt, the listener. These songs     are almost impressive in their sparkling inconsequentiality. ""Everybody loves     foreign girls,"" we're told on ""Foreign Girls"". ""Everybody wants foreign girls.""

Not exactly--     the story told by RZA in the <em>Wu-Tang     Manual </em>has one major advantage over the narrative sorta-established by his     alter ego over the past decade (!) in that it actually has something of a point     to it.  Namely, that any time the Wu has     been caught slippin', it's because everyone else failed to give RZA the benefit     of the doubt.</p><p>And while it's easy for RZA to claim ownership of 20/20     foresight while trying to do the unprecedented, micromanaging the careers of     eight budding superstars, it wasn't until winter of last     year where his <em>artistic </em>leadership     underwent real scrutiny.  While a Wu-Tang project in name, <em>8 Diagrams </em>was ultimately considered RZA's     baby, as the rest of the Clan (most notably Raekwon and Ghostface Killah) wiped     their hands of it upon release, slamming the Abbot as a control     freak ""hip-hop hippie"" that went behind everyone's back to completely change     the character of the record-- a sentiment that gained even more traction after     the subsequent drop of Ghost's excellent but     cruise-controlled <em>Big Doe Rehab. </em></p><p>But the divisiveness was more talked about than practiced-- both     records had nearly equal fortunes commercially (none) and critically     (almost rote praise).  Still, it's     easy to see how RZA could piggyback on this situation and garner so much     goodwill leading up to his latest solo LP.  First off, he didn't come     out of that fiasco looking as petty as Ghost and Rae do when they bitch to the     media, and while <em>8 Diagrams </em>wasn't     the maverick work of genius some tried to pawn it off as, his sonics did enough     to temporarily deflect the fact that half the Clan sounded frighteningly     washed-up.  More to the point, Bobby     Digital is actually a more trustworthy brand name as far as solo albums go--     his first two bows are uneven, but unhinged semi-classics     amongst the Wu faithful, while <em>Birth of a     Prince</em> (released as RZA) contained tracks like ""We Pop"" and ""Fast Cars"" that have few peers     in his discography in terms of sheer awfulness.</p>
<p>Yet despite     being erudite and lucid in his recent outside pursuits, <em>Digi Snacks </em>finds RZA unable to convey what he really believes,     stumbling through mealy-mouthed lyrical and musical ideas before passing the     baton to a more engaged but exponentially less interesting subordinate.  He's actually become easier to parse-- far     less of the ""prominent dominant Islamic Asiatic black Hebrew"" stuff;     unfortunately he's a lot harder to <em>understand. </em>Here he's working with about three mismatched cadences at once on ""Booby Trap"", as a     grown man going by the name of Dexter Wiggles shouts, ""Zap! It's a booby     trap/ Would you like a digi or a Scooby snack?""      Even as someone who thought that ""ears of corn/ And heads of lettuce"" ran     on some engine of internal logic, <em>Digi     Snacks</em> is unknowable, switching from boilerplate social uplift (""I said, 'damn that's poverty'/ He said, 'that really bothers me'"") to Gods and Earths     pillow talk to Wu mythologizing to standard-issue gun talk, all of it bound     together by god knows what-- maybe a weird admiration of Jay-Z's <em>The Black Album</em>?  <em> </em></p>
<p>It's as good of a guess as any, considering RZA bites the     ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"" flow wholesale on ""No Regrets"", and slaps it on a <em>Maths &amp; English </em>leftover starved of     air and funds. But I guess we shouldn't go any further before discussing     ""Straight Up the Block"", a collaboration with David Banner that makes more     sense than it first seems-- after all, both have an aversion to meter and a penchant     for dubious political conspiracies.  But     this attempt at an international player's anthem manages to be the most     egregious misuse of talent outside of the Mets-- Banner     salvages the beat from Swizz Beatz' scrapyard and then tunes down RZA's voice     to the point where his slow grind French (""Je m'appelle Bobby     Digi-tell...mademoiselle"") tumbles out of his mouth like broken Slinkys.</p>
<p>Advance single ""You Can't Stop Me Now"" gave the impression     that we might get a more earthbound, introspective RZA, but it's like ""December 4th"" without those silly interludes-- who hasn't heard this story of     his come-up dozens of times?  It doesn't     help that RZA sounds almost completely uninvested. He could just as easily be     reciting from a book, which is technically an improvement over the thudding, bored     verse from Inspectah Deck, who might as well be rattling through the Yellow     Pages. With that you see the ill effects of the estranged Clan,     since Deck's bow is the only one from the A-listers on the entirety of <em>Digi Snacks</em>.</p>
<p>After the turbid nightmares of <em>8 Diagrams</em>, it's no surprise that <em>Digi Snacks </em>is a notably lighter affair, but it just divides RZA's     work between a pop audience that never really wanted him and the hardcore Wu     heads who think ""Tearz"" is as soft as they should ever get.  ""Good Night"" revives the waterbed motion of ""My     Lovin' Is Digi"" better than the eponymous sequel, mostly because it's still     entertaining to hear didactic rhymes about sinking one's ""Titantic"" (sic)     into your Atlantic and the boundless verbal elasticity needed to fit ""Chicago,"" ""Virgo,"" and     ""convertible"" in the same rhyme pattern.</p>
<p>If anything, <em>Digi     Snacks </em>managed to pinpoint where we are in the Wu cycle of life.  In 1998, hip-hop was flush with enough cash     to possibly sustain a Bobby Digital movie and now, low-overhead labels like     Koch ratchet down expectations to the point where it can be pursued as the     niche project it always was.  But     ""half-baked"" isn't an improvement over ""raw"" for a guy like RZA, and anyone     who's heard a recent Kool Keith record can tell you that an astounding catalog,     reality-defying self-confidence and an otherworldly alias can't restore rapidly     dwindling goodwill on its own. Things just ain't the same for quasi-mad     scientist/ghetto philosopher/sexual dynamo superheroes.</p>

Thanks in large part to two of those singles, ""Mandarine Girl"" and ""Body Language"", a collaboration with M.A.N.D.Y. that was deemed Ibiza's 2005 ""Track of the Season,"" they're among the most globally recognized names in an increasingly fractured electronic dance-music scene, and they tour assiduously to support that reputation. The duo's members, Walter Merziger and Arno Kammermeier, also co-direct Get Physical, the label they founded in 2002 along with Thomas Koch (DJ T) and M.A.N.D.Y.'s Patrick Bodmer and Philipp Jung. But it's not just the length of their workweek, nor the fact that their biggest hits are now three years behind them, that must be tiring. It's their ambitions. Despite their roots in club culture, Booka Shade and Get Physical determinedly pursue the home-listening audience as well as the dance floor, at a time when album sales are down and electronic albums are even more of a ""why bother?"" proposition. As much as fans dance at their shows and DJs play their singles, Booka Shade are rare holdouts for grownup electronica, the kind of subtly shaded comfort listening, equally informed by pop and technological play, that has all but disappeared in this decade.<br/> <br/> <em>The Sun and the Neon Light</em> is certainly their most grown-up album yet: there are fewer obvious singles and more brooding, downtempo moments. While Booka Shade have always been known as a software-centric project-- one of the few acts to be sponsored by a software company, their albums bear the imprimatur of Berlin's Native Instruments, makers of soft-synths like Reaktor and amplifier simulators like Guitar Rig-- they move into the world of ""real instruments"" on this disc, a sure sign of a band intent upon a rather conventional kind of musical maturation. ""Outskirts"" features strings courtesy the German Film Orchestra of Babelsberg; gentle acoustic guitar rustles prominently in ""Solo City""; and there's even a scrap of acoustic blues, a sort of tongue-in-cheek genre cameo, at the center of ""Dusty Boots"".<br/> <br/> What's curious, then, is that <em>The Sun and the Neon Light</em> feels less lively than any of their previous work, in both mood and sonics. I've always suspected that Booka Shade's reliance on software synthesizers bears some of the responsibility for a certain airlessness in their sound, but that hasn't always worked against them: On tracks like ""Mandarine Girl"" and ""Body Language"", it's precisely the buzzy, pulse-wave sounds that give the music its charge, hovering ominously between euphoria and uncertainty, tinged with a whiff of electrical fire. But this album seems somehow even more cloistered; despite the copious amounts of space in the music-- Booka Shade honed their craft composing music for television advertisements, and they clearly know their way around the studio-- nothing ever seems to really breathe, to open up. I don't mean to privilege one kind of electronic sound over another-- championing ""grit"" in electronic music is often a rockist feint towards specious notions of authenticity, and analog synthesizers and drum machines are not necessarily better than their software-based, ""virtual"" counterparts. But too much of this album feels static, like a hothouse vacuum.<br/> <br/> That's too bad, because it works at cross-purposes with the duo's obvious goal for this record: With four vocal tracks at its core, it's clearly their attempt at pop crossover. Given their reputation for crowd-pleasing, you'd expect them to do it better. ""Pop"" needn't mean Kylie, of course, and it certainly doesn't here: Booka Shade take their cues from Depeche Mode, from chord changes to sound design, from the vocal stylings to the familiar second-person delivery. The vocal melody of ""Control Me"" is a dead ringer for Depeche Mode's ""World in My Eyes"", while the shuffling ""Psychameleon"" is as indebted to ""Personal Jesus"" as it is to Kompakt's glam-derived <em>Schaffel</em> stomp. The songs aren't bad, but they hardly feel essential; something about their neatly resolving chord changes and their careful balance between controlled noise and mellifluous tastefulness seems self-canceling. They dissolve as soon as they're finished. (The lone exception is the quietly overwrought ""Sweet Lies"", which is pretty bad; fortunately, it dissipates just as quickly.)<br/> <br/> Two singles, ""Karma Car"" and ""Charlotte"", preceded the album in various club mixes, and it's no coincidence that they're the strongest things here. Booka Shade, fortunately, remain crackerjack composers for the dance floor. ""Charlotte"" expertly juggles a fat, goofy bassline with oodles of squelchy counterpoint lines that spin into a dizzying array of brighter-than-life overtones. (More malleable than all but the most sophisticated of their hardware counterparts, software synthesizers are particularly good at that kind of spine-tingling morphology, and Booka Shade know how to wring every last drop of excitement out of a modulating filter.) I have no idea what they're singing through their vocoders, but here the human element does help to warm up the song; pop and rave in equal measure, the song's a worthy homage to Madchester's madcap spirit.<br/> <br/> ""Karma Car"" is even better. No matter that it essentially recycles every trick in the Booka Shade playbook-- or maybe precisely for that reason-- it's one of their best tracks yet. Bleepy contrapuntal phrases, clever chord changes that pivot like universal joints, shivering bass-and-treble harmonies that glide in unison up and down the scale-- they're all here, plus some lovely <em>Black Celebration</em>-aping synths, and a baritone chorus that's genuinely hummable. It's tracks like this that keep me interested in the group. But the ability to score hits doesn't equal the capacity for essential longplayers. Ultimately, <em>The Sun and the Neon Light</em> is an unwittingly perfect title for the album, and not only because it conjures the alternating senses of brooding and yearning that their music aims for. What the title describes is just as ineffable as their sound: you can see it coming down, but somehow it fails to leave any tangible impression.</p></div>"|11941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11941-the-sun-and-the-neon-light/|5.8|Philip Sherburne

And at 79-minutes long, <i>Focus Level</i> comes about as close to eternity as a compact disc will allow. And that's kind of hard to take in one sitting.</p>
<p>Formed in New York in 1997 by selected Matador Records employees and a professional record collector, Endless Boogie practiced for nearly four years before playing their first show-- an opening slot for Stephen Malkmus in 2001. Since then, the band has done small-scale tours with Dungen and the chameleonic Finnish metal group Circle (who are also their No Quarter label mates) as well performing sporadically in their hometown. They've released two limited press 12"" records-- <i>Endless Boogie I</i> and <i>II</i>-- which have at this point vanished forever into the collector scum ether. A hobby band for aging music nerds, Endless Boogie is dangerously low on careerist aspirations. They won't even play a show unless somebody invites them to.</p>
<p>For the most part, the music on <i>Focus Level</i> can largely be described with the language one might use for a barbecue chicken recipe-- hooks are slow simmered and gooey, leads are greasy, and the skin is slightly charred. Over the course of 10 minutes, songs like ""The Manly Vibe"" and ""Executive Focus"" work the unexplored (and unexpected) ground between Neu! and Black Oak Arkansas-- carrying hypnotic grooves into tongue-wagging bar-rock abandon with the dueling dollar-bin solos of guitarists Paul Major and Jesper Eklow. Major also enhances the swampy vibe with a stew of bridge troll grunts and growls. ""Tell me why that is/ The paper boy don't come no more,"" he ponders on ""Bad River"", fully capturing the low growl of Captain Beefheart-- and also Dr. Teeth. But the lyrics are just as soon said as forgotten as the band departs on a laid back stroll toward the next guitar solo. <i>Focus Level</i> is rock minimalism at its most casual-- austere repetition and art noise that's good for both the bong-water soaked psych-cognoscenti and the chili cook-off.</p>
<p>But if you've seen enough Coors Light commercials, there's a good chance that a large portion of <i>Focus Level</i> will slide beneath your threshold of sensory perception. It's hard to think of a genre of music more ubiquitous than the electric blues, and after hearing more than an hour of Endless Boogie's mellow chugging the music starts to slide, er, <i>out</i> of focus, becoming a dank and yellow aural wallpaper. Their earlier limited press records each served up one monolithic sidelong jam, and then two snack-size portions-- which is closer to the right dose. Given the band's MO-- you know, endlessness-- it's easy to understand how Endless Boogie couldn't pass up the chance to release a double album. The four-sided record is the hallmark of classic-rock over-indulgence, and the extension of that indulgence is Endless Boogie's whole show. But it can be a hard show to sit through.</p></div>"|11939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11939-focus-level/|6.8|Aaron Leitko

To my mind, this distinguished him from the more interchangeable contingent of instrumental hip-hop producers: a prototypical Daedalus track is about as sticky as an oil slick, but Lipp's indelibly outsized themes sear themselves into your brain. He's an unabashed crafter of bangers, with none of the stereotypical indie producer's crippling fear of transparency.</p><p>Lipp's as dependable as ever on <em>The Outside</em>, sequencing analog synths over kinetic breakbeats, and splicing his peripatetic influences-- vintage electro; Krauty Detroit club and Eurocentric filter-swept techno; jazzy undie-hop; brisk G-funk; decadent Sunset Strip glitz-- into anthem after swaggering anthem. <em>The Outside</em> could have easily comprised a continuous double-disc with 2006's <em>Tacoma Mockingbird</em>, except that it mixes up its purebred anthems with some IDM contortions. The uncomfortably titled ""Baby Tank"" refracts pop-industrial through a prism, while ""The Machine and the Wind"" is crystalline ode to sprung clockwork.</p><p>Lipp's music is catchy because it's repetitive, establishing an infectious melodic theme and grinding on it for three to five minutes. But it's engaging because it behaves unpredictably within this repetition: Lipp vamps on his themes through fugal variations and diverse FX sweeps. In the cosmopolitan jungle of the title track, he smears his robo-funk theme with acid-squelches and chokes it with sundry gargle effects so it whizzes around like a punctured helium balloon over the pimp-strutting low end. The mellower ""Opening Ceremony"" flips the script: here, it's the low end that distends and mutates, while the hovering synth clouds and pinging melody remain relatively constant, beyond the judicious introduction of some tooth-grinding ring modulator effects.</p>
<p>Lipp also keeps things lively by occasionally expanding his palette beyond toxic-sunrise Korg tones. ""The Area"" slips needling funk guitar and splashes of piano into its stylized neon squiggles, and ""7 Mile Tunnel"" hurls a delicately sliced voice amid the bumper-car synths. And his tonal range is admirable-- he can go mystical, as on ""Beyond the City"", which deploys trills of revelation (similar to those on Four Tet's recent ""Ribbons') to terrific effect; he can go svelte and simmering, as on ""The Meaning"", whose ground-hugging synths lick and glimmer like small flames. He can flip a bassline so clipped and compressed that it sounds alien, or a bassline so rich and organic it sounds like someone humming. And he can do it all while feeding us exactly the unpretentious heaters we've come to expect from him.</p></div>"|11938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11938-the-outside/|7.5|Brian Howe

Eno's rhetorical sally dates back to 1975, and the story since... well, it's not much of a story in and of itself. What <em>has</em> been a story, as the music has bedded down with softness and nuance, is how the ""ambient"" enterprise has come to color everything else around it. </p><p>Setting aside their considerable beauty, the ambient tracks on <em>Muting the Noise</em> owe part of their impact to how they fit in with the rest of what's going on in electronic dance music. Such is the fate of any ambient album now, it would seem-- especially when the album is compiled by a dance label in Berlin. That's the home of Innervisions, the label run by house heads Dixon and Âme, and the imprint's stable of producers represents their milieu as more than just a cluster of ambient devotees. What makes ambient tracks by Âme and Henrik Schwarz compelling, then, is not just their amorphous atmospheres, but also the ways those atmospheres evoke the kinds of atmospheres that both producers rub down in their more rhythmically antic brands of now-sound house.</p><p>It would be a mistake to undervalue their considerable beauty, though. If some ambient music is made to be taken for granted, then Âme doesn't help the cause with ""Doldrums"", a gorgeous rush of synth cycles that phase in and out over just the barest hissy suggestion of a beat. Schwarz does it better with ""Arthur"", an intricate piece dotted with a florid piano theme reiterated in different ways and metallic percussion that plays less in measures of rhythmic beats than in timbres of pure sound.</p>
<p>Rhythm doesn't figure strongly on <em>Muting the Noise</em>, aside from the sense of momentum gathered in cycles and loops. A few tracks, Karma's and Tokyo Black Star's especially, fall into that propulsively loping realm of ambient scored by Tangerine Dream in <em>Risky Business</em>. (There's many a fantasy of sensuous train travel to be entertained here.) A couple of others skew as noisy in comparison: I:Cube's ""Nuées Ardentes"" hints at ravy sounds while crackling under with dub, while Stefan Goldmann's ""Life After Death"" plays like a moody piece of musique concrète-- all ghostly reed squeaks and test-tones mixed into a disembodied spell. </p>
<p>Nothing on <em>Muting the Noise</em> stands to redirect what's thought about ambient music as a project or as an addendum to other sounds, but all of it is measured and ambitious in its way. The only curious standout is the outro by Klaus Schulze. With his stints in Tangerine Dream and Ash Ra Tempel and a sizeable solo career, Schulze is a legend, yes, and his ""Invisible Musik"" covers lots of ground-- but an incongruous running time of 18:08 makes it hard not to at least wonder what happens when ambient steps out beyond its modest means.</p></div>"|11940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11940-muting-the-noise/|6.2|Andy Battaglia

    Oddball Rappers. Lugging the backpack long before there was a codified arty
    hip-hop scene, Del sneaked onto the radio, clinging by his fingernails to
    cousin Ice Cube's Chuck Taylor strings. Of course, even his hard-rock relative
    was befuddled by the Sapien's giddy spirals of abstract, meaningless verbiage.
    ""Del,"" queried Cube on his oddball cuz's debut, ""What the fuck is a Funkee
    Homosapien?""</p><p>
    
    What the fuck, indeed.  Del was never shy when it came to flaunting his
    restless MC intellect, favoring elaborate puns and encyclopedic vocabulary
    over, like, meaning. The classic example of this, naturally, is Del's first
    single, 1991's ""Mistadobalina."" The track served as a lengthy put-down on
    some guy named Mr. Bob Dobalina, about whom very little was clear except that
    Del found him a little silly.</p><p>
    
    Del has always seemed irritated at having to address the real world, and as
    such, his best verses are completely divorced from it.  For the most part,
    his last few albums have kept things defiantly surreal, which is great fun,
    but also chafes the listener. Surely, a lyricist with Del's heavy-duty
    intelligence has interesting thoughts to share about something other than how
    cool he and his friends are.  It seemed we'd never know... until now.</p><p>
    
    Paired with the Automator, the Kool Keith-embraced-and-scorned poet laureate
    of creepy, oppressive beats, Del has finally sent himself where he belonged to
    begin with: outer space.  On <i>Deltron 3030</i>, he unravels an album-length
    narrative about the titular year, in which he's a superhero named Deltron Zero
    (a plot not entirely dissimilar from that of RZA's <i>Bobby Digital</i>).
    Armed with his two sidekicks, the Automator (here saddled with the unfortunate
    sobriquet ""The Cantankerous Captain Aptos"") and scratch mastermind Kid Koala
    (aka ""Skiznod the Boy Wonder""), Deltron-Z combs the galaxy, supporting his
    secretive Earthling existence by participating in weird rap battles where
    one's rhymes summon psychic powers that physically damage the opponent.</p><p>
    
    At least, that's what may be going on. Like most hip-hoperas, there's not
    much stock placed in narrative coherence here. Fortunately, the plot setup--
    delivered by a deliciously, almost impossibly bored-sounding Damon Albarn--
    gives way to a loose set of ruminations on a myriad of subjects. Of course,
    the rap-battle set pieces afford Del plenty of time to lavish attention to
    his favorite subject: how cool he is in relation to you and any poor soul
    who would dare challenge his verbal supremacy.</p><p>
    
    But, allowed room to imagine a whole world, many of <i>Deltron 3030</i>'s
    most impressive tracks show our hero exploring a wide-ranging variety of
    surprisingly weighty topics. The future is imagined from the bottom up: Del
    lives in a secret lair in the Bay Area, unbothered by exorbitant rents while
    the world around him falls to pieces.  The Earth is run by a select,
    superwealthy oligarchy who have consigned the underclasses to rot away. (Yes,
    this is the future.) The environment's in ruins, there's fighting in the
    streets, and Paul Barman gets a speaking role. In short, things are in bad
    shape.</p><p>
    
    Such dire straits reveal Del as a surprisingly acute social critic. He even
    lacks a New York protest MC's frustrating tendency towards self-righteousness,
    instead favoring targets that actually deserve his wrath: he wants to destroy
    corporate control and ""convert them to papyrus,"" mostly, and his oppressed
    underclass is racially diverse.  Like the man says, ""It's not about separation/
    It's about the population."" He resents the appropriation of hip-hop, but not
    necessarily by palefaces. He just doesn't like biters because they're messing
    with the genre's chances of being taken seriously.</p><p>
    
    In the end, that's the most exciting thing about <i>Deltron 3030</i>. Though
    never self-satisfied or deliberately obscure, the record is an infinite
    improvement over the wanky verbal gymnastics that currently crowd smug,
    jerk-off rappers' 12-inches. Though Del may have helped start that trend,
    here he aches to say something significant. In places-- like the sad, almost
    Gothic ""Madness,"" the album's masterful centerpiece-- he even succeeds.  Now
    liberated from the obnoxious demands of everyday reality, he's finally found
    a way to say something meaningful about it.</p></div>"|2272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2272-deltron-3030/|8.8|Sam Eccleston

    As I was finishing an interview with Gregg Gillis in July 2006, he casually mentioned his desire to see M. Night Shyamalan's
    just-released fantasy movie <em>Lady in the Water</em>. Given the film's wretched reviews-- a
    pitiful 24% on Rotten Tomatoes-- and the train-wreck hype
    surrounding it, I thought he was kidding. He wasn't; Gillis liked some of Shyamalan's
    other flicks, so he wanted to check this one out. Simple. And it's this
    omnivorous, pleasure-seeking attitude toward pop culture that defines his work as Girl
    Talk. (Luckily, his taste in music is superior to his taste in film.)</p><p>
    Unlike mash-up makers in it to figure out the lamest way to combine
    two song titles, justify their existence with cheap mp3 blog Diggs, or wind up in a Cobrasnake shot with some Olsen twin look-a-like, Gillis
    just really likes stuffing tons of his favorite FM moments into
    bursts of Top 40 overload. ""I'm a pop music enthusiast,"" he told me. Hailing from the anti-flash city of
    Pittsburgh, Gillis has sidestepped the Absolut-sponsored stigma
    associated with of-the-moment party starters ever since 2006's <em>Night Ripper</em>
    sent him on a never-ending tour of sweat-stained clubs. While his live set changes with the ebb and flow
    of the Hot 100, this is Gillis' first major release as a semi-popular act. Unsurprisingly, his new record, <em>Feed the Animals</em>, comes off like the ultimate July 4th
    rooftop soundtrack. Seems like those stage-crashing dates made the
    unassuming former biomedical engineer even more eager to indulge his
    hungry followers. As the recognizable samples zip by at a
    dizzying clip, it's as if Gillis is standing tall above the fray, screaming: ""Are you not entertained?!""</p><p>
    Even with pop's long tail extending with each passing year, there are still new trends that recall the days when hits were hits and major labels ruled the world. While Gillis' pile-on sampling style isn't new (see: <em>Paul's Boutique</em>, DJ Z-Trip, the Avalanches, 2 Many DJ's, et. al),
    its confluence of shamelessness and abundance is unparalleled. For all
    its forward thinking, <em>Feed the Animals</em> has an old-school bent. First
    thing: It's an album. Many of Gillis' contemporaries
    couldn't be bothered with such an outdated concept, but by choosing the
    LP route-- instead of, say, a monthly series of hit-blending MP3s-- he's
    outing his traditionalist tendencies. Gillis is not just trying to just tide his
    fans over until the next show here, he's trying to give them something
    to anticipate at the next show. 
    </p>
<p>
    Which brings us to the Three
    Stages of Girl Talk: knee-jerk recognition, easy-to-swallow consumption,
    and, finally, cemented recontextualization. When people go apeshit for
    his famous Biggie-Elton John pairing, they're taking pleasure in their
    own memories, the room's collective memory, the indisputable greatness
    of ""Juicy"" and ""Tiny Dancer"", and, possibly above all else, they're
    cheering for the Girl Talk song that combines all those things so seamlessly. In concert, these mental synapses pop at the same time, and the result is thrilling-- the apotheosis of the Girl Talk experience. </p><p>
<em>Feed
    the Animals</em> offers a new round of associative concoctions ready
    to blow out clubs this summer and beyond. Perhaps in an effort to work
    his crowd up quicker and more efficiently, Gillis spikes his signature mix of
    current smashes, hip-hop, 1980s pop, 90s alternative, and classic rock
    with a slew of wedding-ready staples. There's a reason why every bar mitzvah DJ has Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's ""September"" in their jam bag and, when it's coupled with Ludacris' pitch-shifted verse from Fergie's ""Glamorous"", it slays. Similarly, snippets from the Jackson 5, the Spinners, and a decent chunk of ""Whoomp! (There It Is)"" provide instant, natural highs.  </p><p>
    Several of <em>Night Ripper</em>'s best moments had Gillis
    unlocking the vulnerability of roughneck rap verses with relatively
    somber backing tracks, and <em>Feed the Animals</em> continues with these
    hard-soft moments. Lil Wayne gets the treatment twice: first when his ""Stuntin' Like My Daddy"" verse (""where I'm from we see a fuckin'
    dead body everyday"") is put over top the ageless ""Nothing Compares 2 U"",
    and then when the hook to ""Lollipop"" is backed by ""Under the Bridge""--
    apart from some pitch issues, the latter's perfect fit is uncanny. The more
    typical juxtapositions are predictably hit (Lil Mama pushing
    shiny lips over Metallica's ""One"") and miss (Jay-Z's ""Roc Boys (And the Winner Is...)"" boasts are miniaturized by Radiohead's
    ""Paranoid Android""), and the classic rock inclusions have a way of
    derailing the mix's meticulous r&amp;b/dance flow. But that's the
    beauty of Girl Talk-- if you hit a lackluster patch, it's over before
    you can say the Band vs. Yung Joc. </p><p>
<em>Feed the Animals</em> helps to solidify Gillis'
    role as the supreme 80s-baby pop synthesizer. And while others have
    attempted to claw up to his lofty position, no one has managed to match
    his unique mix of diversity, pace, and open-mindedness-- not to mention
    his exquisite ear for snagging the best 15 seconds of every three-minute track blaring from your clock radio. He's post-modern,
    post-guilty pleasure, and post-lawsuit (maybe). ""The whole basis of the
    music is that people have these emotional
    attachments to these songs,"" he told me. ""Being
    able to manipulate that is a really easy way to connect with people.""
    Easy for him; good for us.

Framed by stringy, grunge-rock hair, it's the face of Stockholm's Andreas Kleerup, already one of the most internationally successful players involved in Sweden's current reign as global pop incubator. Perhaps unlike, say, Robyn, Peter Bjorn and John, ex-Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman, or Jens Lekman, you probably don't recognize him-- by name <em>or</em> by face. All right, then. That's why they call this an introduction.</p><p>
    If you know Kleerup already, you probably first heard about him as producer of Robyn's 2006 single ""With Every Heartbeat"", an orchestral electropop ballad full of soulful melodies and the queasy emotional conflict of a breakup that hurts every bit as much as you know it's right. Re-released last year in the UK, the song went to the top of the charts, and the new U.S. single has done well on domestic dance and singles sales charts this year as well. After the Robyn coup came remixes for Shout Out Louds, the Concretes, and others, along with a collaboration on the latest Cyndi Lauper album (seriously).</p><p>
    Kleerup's self-titled album-- currently import-only outside of Sweden-- marks his solo debut, though he has appeared on a few scattered releases (including a remix of the Tough Alliance) as a member of an electropop trio called the Meat Boys. The CD booklet offers seven more portraits of the artist's unsmiling face, each about the same except for different color schemes or shadows. The album itself puts Kleerup's best face forward, featuring ""With Every Heartbeat"" plus 11 other home-recorded songs; aside from several completely solo excursions, the tracks stay pretty much within the same computer-plus-Swedish-chanteuse template. Good thing it's an enjoyable template.
    </p><p>
    ""With Every Heartbeat"" still sounds devastating here, and the other collaborations take a similarly lovelorn path. The best is ""Until We Bleed"", with up-and-comer Lykke Li, which again relies on strings and a house beat, this time with frazzled synths coaxing out the volatility that distinguishes Li from her peers. It's as good an introduction to the singer as anything on her estimable, Bjorn Yttling-produced debut, <em>Youth Novels</em>. The Concretes' Lisa Milberg brings the gentle anguish and pop-oriented lyrics of her group's latest, <em>Hey Trouble</em>, to ""Music for Girl"", which sounds like the Knife doing Motown: ""The songs, you know, they never leave you for another."" Closer to the Robyn track's bright expressiveness are lonesome, Italo-tinged comedown ""3AM"", with Marit Bergman (who has also been produced by Yttling, including on a 2002 debut titled <em>3.00 A.M. Serenades</em>) and Titiyo-sung second single ""Longing for Lullabies"". Titiyo's older sister, none other than Neneh Cherry, strikes a vague, awkwardly worded political stance on children's choir-assisted ""Forever"", though her smoky voice still resonates.
    </p>
<p>
    Kleerup's tracks without guests are the real revelation. ""Thank You for Nothing"" is another standout, with the producer's own wounded vocal repeating within whirring beats. ""On My Own Again"" takes a peppy John Hughes-film left turn, with the cheeriest synths on the album and ramshackle acoustic guitars. The instrumentals-- from hard-charging, Simian Mobile Disco-esque opener ""Hero"" to fragile, ambient-leaning finale ""I Just Want to Make That Sad Boy Smile""-- don't break the momentum. Look at that album cover again. Yep, it's the face of a guy who just recorded an accomplished, cohesive debut, one that should please fans of ""blog house"" and Swedish pop alike. Now if only he owned a razor.

    If Nurse With Wound means anything more to you than ""that band that takes up a whole browser in the 'Industrial/Goth' section of my local record store,"" chances are they inhabit a strange place in your collection. Equally indefinable and uncollectible, Steve Stapleton's Nurse With Wound have spent the past 30 or so years crafting what sounds like indigenous music for household appliances. That Stapleton's latest, <em>Huffin' Rag Blues</em>, has dropped with a silent, drone-y thud even amongst out-music fans is no real surprise, as even NWW cultists aren't starved for material (e.g. 2005's decidedly under-considered <em>Angry Eelectric Finger</em> is receiving a double CD/photo book addendum). <em>Huffin' Rag Blues</em>, a collaboration with, among others, experimental sound artist Andrew Liles, extends Stapleton's exploration of the bizarre and arcane via tricks like obscure and disorienting samples and minimal industrial noise-- this time juxtaposed against bop and swing music.</p><p>
<em>Huffin' Rag Blues</em>' nods to big band and jazz-- as well as its appropriations of linear, identifiable grooves-- suggests NWW's 1996 question <em>Who Can I Turn to Stereo?</em> might be Stapleton literally asking his boombox for answers (rather than casually pondering who he can transmogrify into a Sony). The aborted album-opening story of ""Willy the Weeper"", a chimney sweep with a dope problem, starts with a januty accompaniment, and is followed by ""Groove Grease (Hot Catz)"" and a lounge organ that surprisingly isn't overrun with angsty noise-niblets until its final minute. ""Thrill of Romance…?"" sets a pulsing horn and spindly Latin guitar work under Freida Abtan's vocals, which sort of sound like Kim Gordon doing standards. ""Cruisin' for a Bruisin'"" rolls a bass-y horn bauble over careening car noises, the noir of <em>Sin City</em> interpreted as roly-poly funk.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, most of <em>Huffin' Rag Blues</em> is spent accomplishing something most albums this singular and creative couldn't imagine: boredom. Stapleton has ideas for miles but the speedometer's fucked. ""Wash the Dust From My Heart"" is a straight-played jazz homage replete with a walking bassline and careful xylophone vibes; that it contains occasional ambient interruption does not distract from its six-minute runtime. ""Advance single""  (ha!) ""Ketamineaphonia"" opens with a snippet of ballpark organ before settling into five minutes of hapless beat instruction and slight orchestral breaks. ""Black Teeth"" inconceivably bats around Captain Beefheart congo-skronk, allowing Matt Waldron ample room for a sub-drug conversation between Satan and, um, a man that wouldn't have made the cut of a third-grade puppet show (""And Satan says 'Here comes a storm/ Get off the bus' and the Man says 'Shutup Satan/ Satan shutup' and Satan says ""Here comes another stop/ Get your fat ass off the bus'""). ""Juice Head Crazy Lady"" and ""The Funktion of the Hairy Egg"" are the most classically NWW tracks here, and while the former sounds inspiringly deranged for four minutes, ""Hairy Egg"" stands as a 14-minute behemoth mercilessly sequenced in the three-hole, eventually devolving-- predictably, somehow-- into a cacophony of barnyard noise.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Huffin' Rag Blues</em> should probably get points for distinguishing itself from the endless string of NWW releases. The cover art-- pressed in a glossy digipak with colors other than black and photos suggesting things other than sadistic sex-- basically assures as much. <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/20461-salt-marie-celeste-she-and-me-fall-together-in-free-death-the-musty-odour-of-pierced-rectums""><strong>Stapleton's complained in the past </strong></a>about his releases floating into the ether, but <em>Huffin' Rag Blues</em>, inspired and deeply flawed, deserves both your consideration and your dismissal. Stapleton's tireless mind merits as much; he was probably right to bitch. And if <em>Huffin' Rag Blues</em> isn't wtf/""Things done changed""/NWW on Demand enough for you, take heart: that <em>Angry Eelectric Finger</em> addendum is eligible for free shipping with Amazon Prime.

A journeyman soul singer, Womack scored 26 chart singles in the 1968-1976 period documented here, but he rarely seems to turn up on, say, oldies radio. He first recorded in the early 60s as part of the gospel act the Womack Brothers, who promptly followed their mentor Sam Cooke's example and went secular as the Valentinos. Later on, he married Cooke's widow (which supposedly got him blacklisted on radio for a few years), wrote a bunch of hits for Wilson Pickett and others, played guitar on records including Sly Stone's <em>There's a Riot Goin' On</em> and Aretha Franklin's <em>Lady Soul</em>, and returned to the charts under his own name in 1968.</p><p>
    Weirdly enough, given his songwriting credibility, Womack spent a good chunk of this era funking up the least soulful pop hits he could find: His first solo hit was ""Fly Me to the Moon"", and he followed that up with ""California Dreamin'"", ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"", and ""Fire and Rain""; his ""Sweet Caroline"" doesn't show up here, but it charted too. Even so, he barely seems to pay attention to those songs themselves: they're all about showing off how impressive his pipes are. (The backing musicians are, unsurprisingly, not credited here either.) He kept dipping back into his older repertoire, too. A 1975 duet with Bill Withers is a remake of the Valentinos-era ""It's All Over Now"", which the Rolling Stones covered for their first British #1 hit in 1964; there's also a 1973 remake of the Valentinos' other hit, ""Lookin' for a Love"", from an album called<em> Lookin' for a Love Again</em>. That title says something about the general sense of commercial desperation on display here; the remake went to the top of the r&amp;b charts, which says something about how desperation moves can pay off if they're executed gracefully enough.</p><p>
<em>The Soul Years</em> is a solid compilation of Womack's hits, sequenced for vibe rather than chronology (although it ignores the fact that his chart career didn't end in 1976; he released three Top 5 r&amp;b albums between 1981 and 1985, and continued to bat at the lower regions of the r&amp;b singles chart for years after that). Put it on at a party and it'll keep everyone happy. But even at his best, Womack was reliable rather than magnificent, a craftsman rather than an innovator. Nearly all of these songs see him skillfully following up on somebody else's bright ideas. Some of those ideas stuck with him for a long time: all over <em>The Soul Years</em>, you can hear little vocal tricks he picked up from Sam Cooke. ""Across 110th Street"" is Curtis Mayfield-style blaxploitation funk; ""You're Welcome, Stop on By"" is a trip into Marvin Gaye territory; a couple of recitative-into-song numbers cop their moves from Clarence Carter and Isaac Hayes. The collection's highlight, ""The Preacher/More Than I Can Stand"", in which he sermonizes onstage on the subject of cheatin' for a few minutes until the band dramatically kicks in, suggests the improvisational force he developed as a touring gospel singer.  </p><p>
    What salvages a lot of these songs, and maybe even what buoyed them up the charts, is that Womack's clearly (and deservedly) in love with the grit and honey of his own voice-- he called his autobiography <em>Midnight Mover: The True Story of the Greatest Soul Singer in the World</em>. Virtually all of them are fine examples of the r&amp;b of their era; scarcely any of them offer something that wasn't done better by somebody else.</p></div>"|11935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11935-the-best-of-bobby-womack-the-soul-years/|6.2|Douglas Wolk

    Kazutaka Nomura bristles at this idea: <em>Serious music</em> has to be <em>austere</em> to be taken <em>seriously</em>. So the biographical materials that accompany the wandering, zero-percent-serious <em>Pwrfl Power</em> seem to position this noisenik's acoustic debut as a brave ""statement record,"" a flag-waver that proudly maintains, Weird Can Be Important Too. Of course, that isn't a wrongheaded sentiment at all. Only problem is, the statement is rarely backed up by Nomura's songs, which spend far too much time on shock tactics and broken English cheerleader lyrics to make convincing cases for themselves.</p><p>
    In a perfect world, <em>Pwrfl Power</em> would showcase Nomura's oft-impressive mastery of the acoustic guitar. As it stands, the album's eleven tracks dabble in Guthrie picking, Kottke alchemy, and even a bit of Ogurusu Norihide quietude. But you have to strain to notice the fanning of styles. What Nomura forces the listener to pay attention to, almost exclusively, is his words-- the presumably put-on ESL awkwardness, childlike nonsense, and whimsy he scatters atop his pieces. Sure, defend all you want, but whether or not the Japanese expat is employing a shtick, songs about dead birds, retarded dogs, and tomatoes simply feel contrived.</p><p>
    Of course, when he's lucky enough to find a convincing sentiment, the wide-eyed innocent thing actually works. ""It's Okay""'s warm refrain of ""It's okay to be yourself, because you are you""-- currently soundtracking an eSurance ad-- opens the album brilliantly, making an impact with a sort of ""duh"" wisdom. Likewise, when Nomura sings of falling for an unattractive girl on ""Alma Song"", there's something endearing in his clueless bluntness. But such qualities don't make it into clunkers like the straight-jacketed ""Heaven, Dog, and Rainbow"", or ""Let Me Teach You How to Hold Chopsticks"", a whacked pop number about teaching a girl to hold chopsticks, and not beating her up because she's pretty.
    </p>
<p>
    Strangely (or maybe predictably), abuse is a theme that emerges several times throughout. Especially on the lengthy ""Soft Boy"", a semi-narrative about a soured romance told from the perspective of a female. ""I've been waiting,"" sings the spurned protagonist, hovering over her cell phone. ""Hit me back, hit me back, hit me back, hit me back, or just hit me, like you used to do."" The fact that it's Nomura's stab at a compelling narrative (and not a non sequitur-laced vignette about losing your keys or roadkilled cats) helps the song climb to the top of the heap here. Indeed, it's the only instance in which Nomura pulls off the damaged weirdo bit successfully, and ironically, the most austere moment on this seriously strange record.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining over the     existence of bands like Denton, Texas' Pyramids (not to be confused with     the 60s surf rock and/or screamo bands of the same name), but rather     feeling a bit overwhelmed at the sheer amount of ideas to be unpacked     from this monster of a debut album. While it's easy to pinpoint the     band's contemporaries, there's no confusing any of the material here     for Boris, Sunn 0))), or Jesu. Yes, they play up the same prettiness vs.     ugliness tensions as those bands, but the lines aren't drawn so     clearly, and most reference points deteriorate within seconds.</p>
<p>One     Pitchfork staffer compared this debut to ""someone disemboweling a     Radiohead record,"" and considering how inchoate this offering is,     that's a pretty serviceable point of entry. That said, Pyramids is a     much messier affair than simply grafting double-kick bass drums and     palm-muted power chords to <i>Kid A</i>. For every skull-rattling series of     drones, there's a long expanse of shapeless dream pop, or a thoroughly     un-groovable section of cerebral post-rock, or just plain insanity.</p>
<p>Despite     each of the 10 tracks here hovering around the three-minute mark,     Pyramids have hardly organized their creativity into nice, neat     packages. The songs tend to meld together rather than stand as     self-contained works. Opener ""Sleds"", one of the few exceptions to that rule, eases us into the album with a wispy Sigur Rós melody from singer     S. Windett. However, once the haunted house moans of ""Igloo"" take over,     there's no getting off the ride. A pesky twin bass drum rears its head     at seemingly random points, so arhythmic that even its presence on an     ambient no-brainer like ""The Echo of Something Lovely"" feels unnerving.     When Windett's vocals detach themselves from the omnipresent flurry of     effects swirls and backwards riffs, the album reaches the kind of peaks     you'd expect from a Hydra Head release. ""End Resolve"", one of the few     instances of melodic and rhythmic synergy, sounds like Thom Yorke     fronting Pantera. On ""This House Is Like Any Other World"", Windett     unravels what's probably the only sustained vocal melody here, made all     the more compelling by its struggle to outshine a thrashing     instrumental cacophony.</p>
<p>Although the back     half stagnates in nondescript death drones, an accompanying disc of     remixes provides a glimpse of Pyramids' potential once they better     utilize their ideas. Jesu's remix of ""Something Lovely"", one of the     bonus disc's four re-imaginings of the track, flashes remnants of the <i>Lifeline</i> EP's delicate shoegaze, a useful lesson in understatement. French metal     group Blut Aus Nord take fey opener ""Sleds"" in the opposite direction,     slathering the reverb splashes with dirge-like arpeggios and Satanic     grunts. As a few botched renderings prove, though, the second disc     doesn't fully humble Pyramids, it just trims the fat off areas where     they seem hellbent on sabotaging themselves as some sort of     post-modernist joke. Sure, they're a very raw talent, but a formidable     talent nonetheless, and this record's peaks hint at even greater     musical epiphanies to come.</p></div>"|11929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11929-pyramids/|6.5|Adam Moerder

Tropical rhythms and warm-weather themes color releases by Jens Lekman, the Tough Alliance, Studio, and the Embassy-- all of whom have recorded for Gothenburg-based label Service. TTA and Studio have since founded their own labels, each with its own cryptic website. Signed to TTA's Sincerely Yours, Air France invited listeners to their ""Beach Party"" with last year's too-good-to-be-true <em>On Trade Winds</em> EP. Air France's latest, the 23-minute <em>No Way Down</em> EP, is better.</p><p>
    The seaside disco of the Gothenburg groups shares many traits with the DJ-ing style named after the Balearic archipelago, off the coast of Spain. Dreamed up on the Balearic island of Ibiza by Argentina-born DJ Alfredo Fiorito in the mid-1980s and soon brought to London, the sound spanned laid-back, groove-oriented music ranging from conga-accented Italo disco and the iridescent proto-techno of Manuel Göttsching's classic <em>E2-E4 </em>to hypnotic indie rock by the Woodentops and offbeat selections from soft-rock, prog, and global pop music. As a DJ-centered art, Balearic house was inherently based on manipulations of other people's music.</p><p>
    Balearic is far from the only musical perspective that can unite an eclectic variety of records without regard to genre or historical context. As the KLF observed in their book <em>The Manual: How to Have a Number One the Easy Way</em>, ""All records in the Top 10 (especially those that get to #1) have far more in common with each other than with whatever genre they have developed from or sprung out of."" That's true from ""Take Five"" to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". What distinguishes the music of Air France and their Sincerely Yours colleagues from the more rock- and groove-oriented sounds of Studio or Norwegian cosmic disco DJs like Lindstrøm, Prins Thomas, and Todd Terje is that they've taken to heart not only Balearic, but also the teachings of chart pop.
    </p><p>
    Air France use elements of both Balearic and pop to create their sumptuous, sincere fantasy world. In that respect, Air France's <em>No Way Down-- </em>currently import-only outside of Sweden <a href=""http://www.klicktrack.com/sy/releases/air-france/no-way-down"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>except as 320 kbps mp3s</strong></a>-- is reminiscent of the Avalanches' dazzlingly great <em>Since I Left You</em>, another record that finds wide-eyed delight in silly stuff like truth, beauty, and fun, as well as Jens Lekman's <em>Night Falls Over Kortedala</em> and the Tough Alliance's <em>A New Chance</em>. It imagines an impossibly idyllic place through sounds that probably could never have been performed that way in real life. Though it's been said, many times, many ways: Welcome to paradise.
    </p>
<p>
    Unlike Balearic disco contemporaries such as Studio or A Mountain of One, <em>No Way Down</em> does childlike joy, not hypnotized headiness. Typewriter-like clicks and John Williams-ready horn fanfares, complete with tympani, introduce the opener, ""Maundy Thursday"". This track soon settles into chilled-out synth washes and sober piano melodies, establishing a tone of sincerity without sacrificing lush outdoor beauty. The swooning string flourishes on finale ""Windmill Wedding"" aren't far off from the introduction to hip-hop producer Bangladesh's ubiqitous beat for Lil Wayne's ""A Milli"". Electric guitar and piano ripple across each other like waves, giving way to Spanish-tinged guitar, percussive human breaths, broken-up female vocals, church bells, and bird chirps. The <em>coup de grâce</em>: the whinnying of a horse. You can almost picture someone's gallant lover galloping across the surf.
    </p>
<p>
    Other tracks are more in the foamy wake of the group's breakout indie late-2006 track ""Beach Party"". ""Collapsing at Your Doorstep"" is gorgeously produced, stupidly catchy, and totally affecting, with an elegant dance groove and an infectious hook. The verses throw lyrics to the wind in favor of wildlife sounds, congas, and woodwinds, which bask in harp glissandos and Göttsching-esque guitar filigrees, plus some string and horn samples. ""No more, no more, no more, no morals anymore/ Throw bottles, throw bottles, throw bottles at your door,"" a woman seems to be singing, followed by children's voices: ""Sorta like a dream?"" ""No -- better."" Nearly as perfect is ""No Excuses"", with handclaps and a yearning chorus: ""No excuses left/ Waiting to fail, but not quite yet."" It's like Saint Etienne for an endless summer.
    </p>
<p>
    As with many other gifted pop and Balearic artists, Air France also happen to be sticky-fingered. Their sources are varied, yet the pleasure isn't recognizing the different sonic elements, but in relishing their almost supernatural co-existence. ""Beach Party"" lifted its hook from Lisa Stansfield. The <em>No Way Down</em> title track directly quotes the Happy Mondays. The melancholy intro that precedes Go! Team-esque horns and cheers on ""June Evenings"" is from late-1980s TV fantasy-romance ""Beauty and the Beast"", as are the children's voices on ""Collapsing at Your Doorstep"", describing both the show's fantastical underground world and the joy of being with someone you love. If <em>No Way Down</em> is about a place that doesn't exist, it's a place where fairy tales are true and where old pop culture ephemera can-- in Air France's fertile musical imagination, at least-- live happily ever after.

Chandra and Leigh's voices and surname adorned Jenny Lewis' 2006 album, <em>Rabbit Fur Coat</em>, an intensely individual document of a boho-celeb's passage through adulthood that found its creator wrestling fearlessly with faith, sex, and all the other things that nag at a maturing heart. Lewis' record may not have been musically adventurous, but her self-aware smarts allowed the Rilo Kiley frontwoman to overcome the typically pale strictures of alt-country and produce the best work of her career.<br/>
     <br/>
    Lewis' twin harmonizers tread the same politely restrained sonic path on their debut full-length, <em>Fire Songs</em>. Unfortunately, the Watson Twins don't possess Lewis' lyrical or performative presence, and all too often their words and melodies fail at even the modest task of standing out from such innocuous landscapes. Calling it coffeehouse music would actually be a correct application of an oft-misused pejorative. It's bullshit to label the work of fierce women like Lewis, Kathleen Edwards, and Martha Wainwright thusly, but in the case of the Watson Twins the soft-soled shoe truly fits.<br/>
     <br/>
    Within a certain very unobtrusive framework, <em>Fire Songs</em> is, truth be told, pretty musically solid. ""How Am I to Be"" kicks things off with a nice Motown-ish vibe, while ""Map to Where You Are"" is spiced with some nifty Mexican horns. The occasionally rambling, ruminative bent of the album's guitars (particularly on ""Dig a Little Deeper"" and ""Sky Open Up"") point to the influences of the Grateful Dead and Neil Young (the girls covered the latter's ""Powderfinger"" for a charity comp earlier this year). Hardly stretching, sure, but you couldn't accuse <em>Fire Songs</em> of being utterly undifferentiated either.<br/>
     <br/>
    That the Watson Twins blend seamlessly into these backdrops, however, is far from a compliment. Of course it's lovely to an extent when the girls harmonize, but neither owns a voice strong enough to convey much besides a languid aridity. And it's not as though their softly-sung words carry quiet bite either-- mostly these lyrics are either unmemorably nebulous or else ring generically false, like the hard-drinking set-up of ""Bar Woman Blues"", the image in ""Lady Love Me"" of ""those bruises you still have on your arm"" or the gently cooed suggestion on ""Old Ways"" that ""you're always on fire."" The noteworthy exception is ""Only You"", which momentarily dispenses with generalities and presents a genuinely nuanced portrayal of the selfishness inherent in love.<br/>
     <br/>
    Far more emblematic of the Watson Twins' approach is their limp cover of the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", which robs the song of all its giddy desperation, replacing it with something that aims for ache but ends up settling for a mere freeze-dried prettiness. You get the sense they could perform the same service with any source material-- the Ramones, ABBA, Slayer, all rendered sleepily sweet.</p></div>"|11932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11932-fire-songs/|4.6|Joshua Love

It's cute and all, but it's also a bit of misdirection: most of the names dropped in this track belong to hip-hop artists, yet for all the invocations of rap icons from Bambaataa to Dre to Dilla, Plantlife's <em>Time Traveller</em> sounds a lot more like a record informed by those artists' production influences rather than the artists themselves-- a second cousin to hip-hop, once removed.</p><p>
    And if that cartoon spaceman voice stops short of admitting he was there when Prince decided to start wearing purple, the rest of the record spends a good deal of time proving it. If the paisley vibe hasn't hit you after reading the tracklist (""Agirllikeudeservesamanwhotreatsuhowulike""; ""Got 2 Find a Better Way""; ""Fool for U""), it probably will after the dirty-minded heavy ballad ""Don't Go Around Looking for a Broken Heart"" and the panting, guitar-driven come-on of ""Lovetoy"" (""Sexy girl, I wanna be your lover boy/ Sexy girl, I wanna be your lovetoy""). And if lead singer/producer Jack Splash doesn't have Prince's vocal range-- he mostly sticks to a somewhat raspy falsetto, which is engagingly dizzy enough to help you ignore how one-dimensional it is-- he definitely has the baby-I'm-a-star routine down. And judging from the darkly comic references to ego tripping and loveless sex in ""They Pay Me 4 This (Typqlsupastar)"", he knows how to subvert it as well.</p><p>
    But on the whole the album's more in the spirit of <em>1999</em>'s omnivorous r&amp;b than a full-fledged knockoff of it, and there're plenty of other familiar funk touchstones all over its DayGlo surface-- P-Funk, Zapp, the Ohio Players, Rick James-- to give it a broader personality that isn't derivative of much else aside from a certain wide-spanning era. The music on <em>Time Traveller</em> is a bit more postmodern and outlandish than the neo-soul production and session work Splash has done for the likes of John Legend and Estelle, ranging from modernized Sly &amp; the Family Stone-esque rave-ups (""Outta Control"") to sleek roller-disco (""Rollerskate Jam"") to semi-Latin yacht-soul (""Sun Shines Through Your Love"") to a guitar-drenched closing slow jam Shuggie Otis would envy (""Fool for U""). What it lacks in a unified style it makes up for in a referential (and reverential) enthusiasm that anyone with a subscription to <em>Wax Poetics</em> should recognize as an individualized, well-crafted love letter to funk gone by-- and funk yet to come.</p></div>"|11931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11931-time-traveller/|7.9|Nate Patrin

    Since the early part of the decade, singer and multi-instrumentalist Margaret Wienk has been firmly entangled within the twisting vines of Philadelphia's prolific psych-folk community. Along the way she has recorded with such luminaries as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, Espers, Damon and Naomi, and Philly's cult-soundtrack troupe The Valerie Project. But her primary vehicle as a singer and songwriter has been Fern Knight, a folk-rock quartet whose debut album <em>Seven Years of Severed Limbs</em> first appeared in 2003. In the time since then, Wienk's songwriting has grown increasingly pastoral and gothic, and with their eponymous third album, Fern Knight now can sound as if they are in deliberate retreat from our current millennium.</p><p>
    Philadelphia's communal folk scene has been so vibrant that it has become that much more difficult for individual talents to distinguish themselves. This has especially been the case for Fern Knight, as Wienk and her group so clearly share a sensibility and common pool of folk influences with Espers. This affinity is further heightened on <em>Fern Knight</em> by the involvement of Espers' Greg Weeks-- an omnipresent figure where Philly psych-folk is concerned-- who helped produce the album and contributes some guest backing vocals.</p><p>
    As with Espers, the music of Fern Knight echoes the spirit and atmosphere of any number of obscure 1970s British folk-rock acts while managing to not sound specifically like any one in particular. The closest ancestors to their sound might be early Steeleye Span, who made similar use of violin and guitar pairings, and the darker orchestrations of such vintage underground acts as Comus or Oberon. Though these rather musty influences risk turning <em>Fern Knight</em> into something of a restoration piece, the album succeeds in large part due to Wienk's classical roots and her innate melodic instincts. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album fairly overflows with images of greenery and the natural world, as Wienk's lyrics abound with fiddlehead ferns, waves of seafoam, various forest critters, and romantic beds of pine needles and moss. Throughout the album, however, a dark undercurrent of trouble and dissonance lurks beneath these deceptively placid idylls. On the opening ""Bemused"" the group's subtle washes of cymbal, harp, and acid guitar loom like ominous thunderheads, while James Wolf's violin provides a spot-on melancholic tug to the lovely, haiku-like ""Hawk Mountain"".  
    </p>
<p>
    Predictably enough, these dark tides eventually draw <em>Fern Knight</em> in a progressively apocalyptic direction, and-- with a nod to hallowed psych-folk tradition-- does so in the form of a song suite. Lofty aspirations aside, the album closing three-part ""Magpie Suite"" results in some of the group's most sumptuous and satisfying work to date.  (The piece even opens with a lyrical reference to Milton's <em>Paradise Lost </em>just in case you might otherwise underestimate the gravity of the situation.) In a form that owes as much to chamber music as to folk, this elegiac suite layers cello, violin, and harp beneath the overlapping vocals of Wienk and Weeks before cycling to a lovely, Baroque choral finish that points hopefully toward the prospect of rebirth and a new dawning. 
    </p>
<p>
    Needless to say, some of Fern Knight's anachronistic details will require a certain level of tolerance that some more temporally grounded listeners might lack. (Personally I wish that Wienk and Weeks had opted to use fewer spacey echo effects on her otherwise crystalline vocals.)  But throughout the album, glimmers of invention and humor are allowed to shine through, such as on the wry ""Synge's Chair"". What sounds on the surface to be yet another somber treatment of a traditional folk dirge instead reveals itself to be a comic Irish travelogue. As the song details their journey, a group of travelers give up their search for the elusive Synge's Chair landmark and instead go have a drink in a bar, returning at last to the present and to those traditions that should be relatable to all listeners. <br/>

David Cook from <em>American Idol</em> had 11 singles in the Hot 100 shortly after his big win. Lil Wayne put up seven Hot 100 singles the week of <em>Tha Carter III</em>. On a much more intimate scale, Sally Shapiro-- the pseudonymous Swedish chanteuse whose <em>Disco Romance</em> debut LP has been bewitching audiences with its fragile mix of warm-hearted synth-pop and icy Italo disco since its original European release in 2006-- has now released her second remix album of 2008. Artistically if not commercially, it's a better idea than Wayne's godawful guest verse on the latest Mariah Carey remix.<br/></p><p>
    Great though <em>Disco Romance</em> is, I'm not sure how many people were clamoring for two volumes of remixes from it. Of the people who might be inclined to check out <em>Remix Romance Vol. 2</em>, though, I can't imagine too many will feel their 10 bucks (or, sigh, torrent ratio) were completely wasted. <em>Remix Romance Vol. 1</em> came as the famously reticent Shapiro was stepping out with her first interviews and DJ gigs, and its 10 tracks turned her shy bedroom disco into disco-disco, putting her wispy vocals and sugar-frosted melodies through the club-friendlier paces of top-notch remixers such as Lindstrøm, Junior Boys, and Juan MacLean. It was a surprisingly successful reconfiguration of the sound Shapiro and producer Johan Agebjörn conceived for <em>Disco Romance</em>, and <em>Remix Romance Vol. 2</em> is, despite a slight overall drop in quality, refreshingly of a piece with its predecessor.</p><p>
    With so many versions of the same Shapiro material already floating around on the world's luckier hard drives, <em>Remix Romance Vol. 2</em>'s best tracks tend to rework their originals rather dramatically. Much as Norway's Lindstrøm did ""Time to Let Go"" as epic psychedelic disco, Canada's the Russian Futurists make Shapiro's signature internet hit, ""I'll Be By Your Side"", into a Russian Futurists song. Considering the Russian Futurists are, like Shapiro, synth-pop romantics who tend to send critics scrambling for snowflake-flimsy metaphors, their ""Side"" keeps plenty of Shapiro's spirit even while adding bouncy lo-fi beats, thrumming guitar-like synths, and lead vocals by the group's Matthew Adam Hart. The Postal Service half Dntel puts sparse, glitchy beats reminiscent of his other group's ""Against All Odds"" cover behind ""Find My Soul"", with wobbly vocal effects that perhaps explain why the song has been retitled ""Find My Ghost"". An Italo disco original, Alexander Robotnick, shifts the Roger Gunnarsson-written ""Anorak Christmas"" from synth-driven twee carol to beat-heavier Eurovision contestant.
    </p><p>
    Newer artists also find plenty to say through Shapiro's songs. Montreal's CFCF-- whose remixing credits include Crystal Castles, HEALTH, the Teenagers, and Apache Beat-- kicks off the compilation with a version of ""Time to Let Go"" that sounds like Justice if their steez were 1980s adult-contemporary rather than heavy metal, as cheesed-out keyboards float across muscular bass lines and thumping beats. Closer to a proper Ed Banger banger is a remix of the same song by Spitzer, a buzzy French brother duo who also recently remixed Kylie Minogue; they chop up Shapiro's vocals and use them as wordless accompaniment for their aggressive filter-disco. Two contributions by fellow Frenchman Dyylan may be excessive, but his takes on ""Hold Me So Tight"" and U.S. <em>Disco Romance</em> bonus track ""Jackie Jackie"" could hardly be more different-- the first lush and upbeat, the second spaced-out and beatless, a pleasant-enough comedown to finish the album.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Remix Romance Vol. 2</em> isn't going to be anybody's favorite album of 2008, but it doesn't have to be. Aside from unnecessarily reprising Agebjörn's ""Norwegian electrojazz"" remix of ""Find My Soul"", which much of Shapiro's Web-savvy fanbase will probably have already heard from the original Swedish <em>Disco Romance</em>, the second compilation of Shapiro remixes continues to put enough new touches on Shapiro's slight if solid songbook to offer the diehards (for whom this release is presumably intended) a few fresh twinges of romance. New listeners should still head straight for the proper LP, but in a time when remixes have come to function more like blog-oriented marketing tools than something fans or DJs might actually spend money on, <em>Remix Romance Vol 2.</em> sounds less like a case of striking while the fire is hot than a breath of fresh air.

It's not a raspberry-- no tongue involved-- more like an imitation horse whinny, and it's the kind of thing you might see a baby doing when she's figuring out all the different sounds that the body can produce. Well, Molly Siegel of Ponytail knows this gesture, and she thinks enough of it to have it be her first sound on the band's second album, <em>Ice Cream Spiritual</em>. At the beginning of the opening ""Beg Waves"", as two guitars play one little angular riff over and over while the drummer makes a nifty hi-hat pattern, like all three are stretching before heading out for a long run, Siegel puts her lips together and lets them flap and then turns the hum into a sort of ""mmmh-bhrrrrrrrr-ahhh!"" And we're off.</p><p>Siegel's voice is an object of fascination in Ponytail because you can't figure out exactly what she's doing and why. The guitars (there are two, played by Ken Seeno and Dustin Wong, but no bass) and drums (by Jeremy Hyman) speak the familiar language or rock'n'roll, but she's coming from somewhere else. She grunts. She shrieks. She wails. She moans. She howls. She chants. She almost never sings, forget about talking: With her approach to vocals, a bunch of words strung together would only be a distraction. Of the however many hundreds of sounds she makes over the course of this album, maybe 1% are used in service of an understandable unit of language. The rest of the time she goes where the spirit moves her. It'd be one thing if she were ""using her voice as an instrument,"" as we music writers like to say, but that's not really it either. She doesn't have any particular vocal gifts, no four-octave range or studied arsenal of effects, and she's not doing anything you couldn't do if you had the desire, stamina, and a few bags of medicated cough drops. But here she is.</p><p>It's hard to know how Siegel's approach might work if she were in another kind of band, but in Ponytail her voice fits perfectly. While their sound may at times overlap with certain experimental rock outfits from Japan-- OOIOO, say, or Afrirampo-- Ponytail are more inclined toward catchy riffs and hooks, and thus far they've shown an aversion to the abstract, free-form noise odyssey. It's not enough fun. Deerhoof are another common reference point, which makes some sense, but Ponytail are far less studied, the more cerebral prog overtones swapped out for the ""Hey guys, let's grab these guitars and make a racket in the garage!"" pleasures of a surf rock band.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that Ponytail are casual and making it up as they go along. All three instrumentalists, as far as I can tell, have chops, and these songs are filled with the kind herky-jerky stop/starts, tempo changes, harmonized leads, and tricky fills you don't think to try unless you have some confidence in your ability. One of the things that elevates this record above <em>Kamehameha</em>, the band's comparatively crude (but still pretty great) 2006 debut, is the sound. With J Robbins producing and the vastly improved sonics, you have a much clearer idea of what everyone is doing. Little things are important with this band, and here, you can actually make them out.</p>
<p>So you get all the tactile detail of the crashing drums in ""G Shock"" as they move from the rolls of the elongated opening section to the galloping propulsion of the tune's middle. You get the hissing of the subtle hi-hat during the track's quiet breakdown, where Siegel coos almost melodically and everything all of a sudden turns sweet. And you get the real sense of atmosphere from the opening of ""Late For School"" as one guitar lets loose a gorgeous cloud of feedback drone, which is then dispersed by the insane arpeggios that take over two minutes in. (Indeed, the guitar tones throughout are an absolute wonder, enough to make even the most jaded electronic music head fall in love again with the possibilities of the guitar/amp interface.)</p>
<p>While Japanese noise-rock or latter-day indie prog come to mind, the band I keep thinking about while listening to <em>Ice Cream Spiritual</em>-- and this even without proper tunes-- is the Pixies. Something about the twists and turns these songs take-- the way they don't quite work like they're supposed to and so wind up working <em>better</em>-- has the feel of <em>Surfer Rosa</em>/<em>Doolittle</em> at their most chaotic. At times it seems like Ponytail took the second half of ""Tame"", the point where Frank Black is reduced to heavy breathing and throat-shredding screams while Kim Deal lets out her ""Ah-ah-ah"" sighs, and extended that minute-long section to album length. And you could see these guys writing something about a superhero named Tony.</p>
<p>Another way to understand Ponytail, finally, is by thinking of them in terms of Baltimore, their city. Like Dan Deacon and the Wham City crew, Ponytail are finding ways to take the concerns of childhood and channel them into deceptively sophisticated music. But instead of the 8-bit toys that every middle class American has laying in front of their televisions, Ponytail build monuments to the boundless energy of kids with a real rock band's tools. And it's here that the pre-verbal approach taken by Siegel again becomes important. I should note that her vocals are going to bug plenty of people, and she may well turn out to be the reason you can't get into this band. But heard another way, over the course of this tremendously fun album, from that opening blurt on, she begins to make a weird kind of sense. Listening to her, I think of John Cage's quote about poetry taken to its logical extreme: She has nothing to say and she is saying it. Loudly. And with a sense of joy that's nothing short of infectious.</p></div>"|11928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11928-ice-cream-spiritual/|8.4|Mark Richardson

    Centro-Matic and South San Gabriel
    are typically discussed as more or less solo projects for Will Johnson, the
    ambitious Austin troubadour who
    specializes in dark, dusty desert noir. It's not just that he is a primary
    contributor to both bands, or that he launched Centro-Matic as a home-recording
    project, but that his contributions under each banner sound so distinctive.
    There's no mistaking his gravelly vocals, his rummage sale lyrics, or his
    rusted-out guitar tone. Each of his groups defines itself by how it deploys
    these signature elements: Centro-Matic grind out weathered but tightly wound
    indie rock, treating Johnson's sometimes indecipherable lyrics as fever dreams
    brought on by exposure to the sun and distortion. South San Gabriel, which
    features all of Centro-Matic plus a revolving line-up of friends, dresses
    Johnson's vocal in strings, drum loops, and off-kilter sounds, their ornate
    arrangements favoring ambience above all else.</p><p>
<em>Dual Hawks</em> is, for
    lack of a better word, a double album: two LPs packaged together, one from
    Centro-Matic and the other from South San Gabriel,
    explicitly underscoring the innate similarities between the two projects as
    well as the complementary differences. On paper, it sounds like an intriguing
    idea, but the Centro-Matic half so thoroughly outshines
    the other that it's hard to imagine anyone playing both after a month or two.
    In other words, it's bound to become a single album in practice. Which raises a
    question: Why even compartmentalize these variant musical impulses? Why not
    shuffle them song by song, so that Centro-Matic's spiritedness might add
    gravity to South San Gabriel's ambience and vice versa?</p><p>
    It's not that the South San Gabriel
    half is bad, just a bit slow and sleepy. Where Centro-Matic songs seem
    spring-loaded, these tracks sprawl. Songs like the plodding ""When the Angels
    Will Put out Their Lights"" and the thudding ""Of Evil/For Evil"" sound
    overthought and fussy, as if Johnson worked to include everyone who showed up
    at the studio. There are moments of clarity, as on the clockwork ""Kept on the
    Sly"" (Matt Pence's drums are as distinctive as Johnson's vocals) or on closer ""From
    This I Will Awake"", with its combination of organ drones and wailing voices. There
    are eleven musicians on these recordings, yet it still sounds like a Johnson
    solo project (specifically like his actual solo album <em>Vultures Await</em>), placing his vocals at the forefront and dressing
    them in strings and effects that suggest, but don't always achieve, a sort of <em>No Country</em> widescreen vista.
    </p>
<p>
    Tighter, louder, faster, and punchier, the Centro-Matic half
    picks up where 2006's excellent <em>Fort</em><em> </em><em>Recovery</em><em> </em>left off, maintaining that musical
    intensity across eleven songs. The drums still scuffle, the guitars still
    grind, and Johnson still comes across as a desert romantic on par with Calexico
    or Howe Gelb. Unlike them, however, he has a weakness for lyrical impenetrability.
    ""Eighteen tubes of butane running corporation fairs / It's discount-like and out
    of time,"" goes the opener, ""The Rat Patrol and DJs"", but as Johnson sings them,
    they sound nevertheless compelling, especially when he crafts unexpected hooks
    from the ooo-ooo-ooo's at the end of each chorus couplet. 
    </p>
<p>
    As the album proceeds, Johnson allows quick glimpses of
    larger issues, like the doomed rock shows on ""Remind Us Alive"": ""Did you notice
    the frequencies will damage you for life?"" Johnson spits, drawing out the long
    syllable in the last word, ""as if the saccharine songs they're playing ain't
    enough of a lie."" The band itself undergirds Johnson's words with a sound that
    is anything but saccharine. Pence alternates between chugging, nearly
    robotic beats and cymbal-punishing high drama, and Scott Danbom's synths pop up
    in odd places, like he's stalking you. Centro-Matic are a guitar band above all
    else, and Johnson and Mark Hedman's dual hawk guitars slice against each other,
    the rhythm lines almost undercutting the leads. As crafty a songwriter as
    Johnson may be, the music delivers more meaning than the words. That's what South
    San Gabriel shoot for and what Centro-Matic achieve naturally.

    Dosh fits many of the backpack rapper stereotypes. He sits on the Anticon roster, a bastion of rule-breaking hip-hop that has no truck
    with the likes of, say, Cam'ron or Petey Pablo. He comes from
    Minneapolis, home of the Replacements and Prince, but wanting for
    nationally known rappers, save the canonized-on-the-quad Atmosphere.
    Dosh's beats aren't composed of soul samples, drowning in bass, or
    expressly built to house verses and choruses: they are impressionistic,
    surging, cut loose of 4/4 constraints. Over the frenzy of drum machines
    and looped samples, he would take the pensive swirl of his vintage
    Rhodes and pile it dramatically-- with a flair for surprise-- on top of
    something else.</p><p>
    But he doesn't rap. His connection to the genre won't be obvious
    to most listeners. In fact, you might call him electronica's answer to
    the rising tide, reported in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, of one-man
    operations that sound like bands. But listening to Dosh, as opposed to
    listening to the equally skilled Four Tet, you don't have the sense of
    technology rudely intruding into the creative process, of the wizard
    too busy to care whether we can see him behind the curtain. He does
    care: where Four Tet parades his mastery of vivid, unapologetic
    collage, Dosh goes for a mastery of illusion.</p><p>
    So like any illusionist, he takes care to start and end with a
    bang. Only Dosh could imagine, let alone orchestrate, a meeting of
    Andrew Bird's tender violin and Fog's hyperactive guitar and bass. The
    play of vibes and keys lends this, the album opener ""Don't Wait for the
    Needle to Drop"", a mesmerizing texture, the grooves recalling a
    funk-tinged, gamelan symphony. ""Capture the Flag"" falls on the other
    end of <em>Wolves and Wishes</em>, where it reaches for the same exotic
    grandeur. Strings appear again, in sampled form, along with the Dosh's
    fuzzy arpeggios. But now we hear a sax pumping away. And more
    surprisingly, we hear Dosh's own voice lowered over the maze
    of noise, cutting a passage of coolness and clarity into the thickets
    of dense, off-kilter instrumentation.
    </p>
<p>
    Between these bursts of color, the album rarely tones it down.
    Without sounding repetitive, a network of reappearing themes, people,
    and sounds holds <em>Wolves and Wishes</em> together. Andrew Bird returns to
    grace ""Kit and Pearle"", for instance, with more anguished turns on his
    violin, underneath Dark Dark Dark's sighing vocals. The outer tracks'
    air of exoticism pours back in on the rhythmically brilliant ""Food
    Cycles"" and ""Keep Up Appearances"". And Dosh's protégé Mike Lewis
    launches his sax into Jeremy Ylvisaker's vibrating, room-filling sheets
    of reverb on ""Wolves"". Not until we reach the final minutes of the
    tectonic, Sun Ra-repping, Arthur Russell-influenced epic ""First
    Impossible"" do we hear an unexpected, unmistakable rap beat. It fits
    right in. People want to call this IDM. The label tells vendor to file
    this under ""Rock"". Bristling with jazzy forms, infused with a global
    soul, <em>Wolves and Wishes</em> turns hip-hop's philosophy of bricolage into a
    glitchy, raucous, genre-spanning achievement.

    Since 1992-- when they were best known as the rhythm section for the much-loved Galaxie 500-- Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang have occupied the kind of niche it's hard to imagine many new indie bands falling into: They make modest, sleepy, intimate folk records, one every few years, around tours and collaborations and running a small label and small press. They've found a pleasant nook and they keep to it, commanding just enough respect and attention to remain comfortably unbothered. <em>Within These Walls</em>-- reviewed here belatedly, and with apologies-- is the latest missive from that nook, and it's a bit difficult to wrap one's head around: It's the best-sounding Damon &amp; Naomi release in a while, but it's also, somehow, less engaging than a lot of the duo's back catalog, a string of records that weren't hugely bothered with ""engagement"" in the first place.</p><p>
    The shift in sound is both gorgeous and timely. The current fashion in indie folk music, after all, is for the <em>freak</em>--  something dark, mysterious, and shot through with psychedelics, as if made by hairy, acid-damaged people in forests at night. It's a treat to hear these two shoot off in the opposite direction: Where previous records from them have been cozy to the point of small-room claustrophobia, this one is positively outdoorsy. The horns that murmur through ""On the Aventine"" conjure up open sky, either sun-filled or pleasantly gray; the production sparkles breezily, and makes you want to throw open your windows, take a short stroll. As background music, it's unimpeachably beautiful, warm and understated. There's a realism, space, and depth of field to the sound that's a very welcome respite from the compressed, blaring way most things are produced these days; it suits the band perfectly.</p><p>
    The album is at its best when that sound combines with the work of longtime D&amp;N collaborator Michio Kurihara, of the (more interesting) Japanese psych/folk group Ghost: His guitar leads, solos, and embellishments here are flat-out soaring. It's that fact, unfortunately, that underlines what's so problematic about <em>Within These Walls</em>. When Kurihara's playing, the album veers into terrific instrumental music, with that guitar confidently occupying center stage, holding the reins firmly; but when either Damon or Naomi are singing, things falter. Sometimes it's the lyrics, which read better on paper than they do on speakers; sometimes it's the melodies, which lilt pleasantly but never worm their way very far into one's head. But mostly, I suspect, it's the limitations of those two voices, both of which are smooth, clear, sedate, and close-miced-- tones that work well for fragile bedroom folk, but struggle to command the stage of these wide-open songs, especially when put up against the power of Kurihara's guitar.
    </p>
<p>
    This is strange, since so many Damon &amp; Naomi albums have come off the other way: decent albums some of us are more inclined to like because they feature the right personalities, two people in a nook we like to check in on. <em>Within These Walls</em> feels like the opposite: a very good record weighed down by two personalities who can't quite command it-- like seeing television stars look suddenly awkward and meek on a movie screen. Which is a shame, because when you're not paying enough attention to this record to need a commanding center, it sounds absolutely marvelous.

For them, ""little"" is scarcely an option: Instead, they've built a career out of conjuring God-sized renderings of sorrow, fragility, and teary joy, rarely on a scale anything less than epic. They've done this instinctively and automatically, sometimes to the detriment of their compositions, leaving the impression that the songs are secondary vessels for spectacle. In the sense that they're less concerned with intellectual honesty than they are with the overall visceral impact of the thing they're creating, Sigur Rós are the Michael Bays of melodrama.</p><p>
    That, of course, is no bad thing-- especially not for a band that does spectacle so well-- but it does invite a problematic dynamic when it comes to the long haul, one wherein they run the very real risk of piling on ever-more ludicrously for the sake of justifying their existence. That's why, after four full-lengths and a string of EPs that saw them bloat their sensory cavalcade of strings, horns, cavernously reverberated guitars, and sweetly vocals to heaven-scraping levels of pomp, last month's single ""Gobbledigook"" came as a refreshing and shockingly grounded new direction. Gone were the celestial delays and cloud-parting refrains; in their place, a tangle of acoustic guitars, thumping percussion, and rabid vocals. Not only did it sound like Sigur Rós doing Animal Collective (!), it sounded like a way out.</p><p>
    And certainly, about half of <em>Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust</em> (translation: ""With a buzz in our ears we play endlessly"") constitutes a much-needed change of direction for Sigur Rós. Building on the gains made from 2005's transitional <em>Takk</em>, they deliver plenty of moments where they sound more spirited, looser, almost playful. The unifying element in these instances is brevity; from the tumbling, modest solo acoustic ballad ""Illgresi"" to the celebratory ""Við spilum endalaust"", some of the band's best songs come when they consciously confine themselves to the pop format. You get the feeling that, on a past album, they might have let ""Góðan daginn""'s acoustic guitar arpeggios and chiming bell tones waft around interminably. Similarly, one of the album's highlights is a major key summer song called ""Inní mér syngur vitleysingur"" which manages to squeeze some of the band's hallmarks (parading horns, glockenspiels, and a stunning teardown and subsequent buildup) into a positively economical four minutes. The compression generally serves them well, forcing them to make choices they might not otherwise confront when there's 10 minutes of real estate to occupy.</p><p>
<em>Með suð</em> was produced by Flood (U2, PJ Harvey, Nine Inch Nails) and recorded, variously, in New York, London, Reykjavik, and Havana, a sure sign of a conscious attempt to shake up their methodology. If there's anything disappointing, it's that Sigur Rós weren't more militant about affecting that change. While the album's greatest triumph is its relative leanness, two songs still threaten the nine-minute mark. The first is the conflicting ""Festival"", which features singer Jonsi Birgisson doing his quavering choirboy routine over a churchly organ for an interminable four and a half minutes before swelling into an instrumental eruption on par with Sigur Rós' finest ever. It's so arresting and muscular on its own that it hardly needs the first bit to introduce it; that the band chose needlessly to build it into a beast feels a bit like old habits dying hard. Far more unforgivable is the comically overstuffed ""Ára bátur"", which is a bet-hedging and nerveless exercise that bridges another aimless solo piano movement with a culminating swell so over-the-top that Andrew Lloyd Webber himself would have deemed it a little much. That the album's official bio proudly touts the 90-strong recording (which boasts both the London Sinfonietta and the London Oratory Boys' Choir) as ""the largest musical undertaking of the band's career""-- and that it's easily the worst thing on here-- speaks volumes of a different kind.</p><p>
    These safe, pandering choices otherwise mar what could have been a game-changing evolution. Instead, <em>Með suð</em> promisingly announces itself as a sunny, happy, easily digestible record before relapsing into old school, heavy-bloat, high-calorie Sigur Rós. Ultimately, there are too many wonderful moments here to deem it anything less than a beautiful record, but armchair producers might find themselves similarly wishing for less fat. How do you say ""less is more"" in Hopelandic? I worry we'll never know.</p></div>"|11924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11924-me-su-i-eyrum-vi-spilum-endalaust/|7.5|Mark Pytlik

""It sounds like the Gipsy Kings,"" she replied in a neutral tone. It wasn't a complaint, but nor was it a compliment; perhaps she was simply commenting on the remarkable fact that someone would want to make a Kylie song sound like the Gipsy Kings, or the even more remarkable fact that Kylie herself would propagate the result. A few months later, over at her house with some friends, the familiar sound of Kylie's vocals and Studio's ringing guitars emerged in the background. The moment passed without comment, but I felt a small, irrational surge of satisfaction: somehow even ""it sounds like the Gipsy Kings"" had become a selling point.</p><p>
    Before people start rushing towards or away from this release on the assumption that they'll find a ""Bamboleo"" or two, I suspect ""the Gipsy Kings"" was shorthand for ""lashings of Spanish guitar."" But the style of the observation, rather than the content, is what matters: There's something about Studio that compels people to repeat this gesture, emphasizing the purposeless perversity of whatever sonic lineage they identify-- just replace ""the Gipsy Kings"" with ""Sting"" or ""World Party,"" or whatever you like. It's not a surprising response: The most widespread and painfully boring critical line on ""nu-Balearic"" music is that its primary function is to render previously intolerable music tolerable-to-hipsters, redeeming Elton John or Paul Simon via the canny addition of a disco beat and some dub echo. This take isn't wrong, exactly, but it's the kind of sociological analysis that makes you hate the world a little bit more after reading it, rather like earnest discussions of how to woo soccer moms for votes. That, plus pretty much anyone who tries to take a position of knowing ""I see through this"" superiority towards hipsters is at first glance being<em></em> hypocritical.</p><p>
    The kernel of truth here is this: What Balearic revivalism does is create a single ""genre"" that can portray a whole host of different types of music in their best light, giving a sense of second-order purpose to music whose functional purpose wasn't entirely clear previously. Perhaps it was too slow, too elaborate, either too songful or not songful enough, too cheesy or perhaps too self-important. Studio rate highly on all of these fronts: Too enraptured with grooves to be a proper rock band, but too attached to morose rock grandstanding not to be; too torpid and dreamy to be a proper dance outfit, but too in love with dancing to be anything else. More subtly, the Swedish duo's music verges on cheesy at the precise moments that it appears self-important (although it's a truism that these are frequently two sides of the same coin). Studio's self-importance is discomforting because it's never clear whether their reach exceeds the grasp or, rather, the act of reaching just a little too far is the entire point of their music. Half the thrills come from watching just how effectively they can deploy bombast. </p><p>
    Following on from <em>Yearbook 1</em>, a collection of their own songs, this second installment offers an abrupt left-hand turn by focusing on Studio's facility as remixers for others, and it's surprising to discover just how easily the Studio sound can be grafted onto the work of others with surprising versatility. Without their own despairing vocals, Studio sound less like the Cure listening to Fela Kuti on a beach in Ibiza, and rather closer to the emergent nu-Balearic norm of heavy, languorous disco grooves-- the 4x4 kick drum is surprisingly dominant, although not unwelcome. What distinguishes Studio's work from their peers, beyond their ever-present fetish for cascading sprays of iridescent guitar, is their prickly restlessness: Most of the inclusions here resist the temptation to coast on a strong groove, instead continually morphing through a kaleidoscopic succession of interlaced motifs like a Mandelbrot set. </p><p>
<em>Yearbook 2</em> alternates between one-offs (like the gentle summertime pop of their remake of the Shout Out Louds' ""Impossible""-- the most conservative cut here) and a sort of staple Studio remix sound: mysterious, almost dark disco grooves populated by glistening synthesizers and glittering shards of the duo's trademark guitar. The quietly ominous epic treatment of A Mountain of One's ""Brown Piano"" and the broiling, dramatic take on Williams' ""Love on a Real Train""-- they could almost be movements in a single piece-- win the day for the latter group, if only because their glowing eddies and curlicues of sound offer the most ostentatious display of the duo's strengths. As remixers, Studio are at their best when most tantric, when their grooves submit to the effervescent fluidity summed up in the title (and, vaguely, the sound) of Can's album <em>Flow Motion</em>, sliding inexorably forward from detail to detail on an endless plateau of simmering intensity.  </p><p>
    Such is Studio's studio wizardry that it's easy to forget that they're also a rock band, especially when they're crafting such delicate, delectable avant-disco remixes. But it's the absence of Studio-as-themselves which ultimately makes <em>Yearbook 2</em> a less captivating experience than its predecessor. On a track-by-track basis, this is as much a bonus as a drawback: Freed from the distractions of having to concoct songs, the duo can concentrate on eking out every drop of prettiness from their grooves, and there's a satisfying sense of aesthetic purity to the formal loveliness of much of their work here. But taken as an album, <em>Yearbook 2</em> can seem emotionally flattened out when compared to its predecessor; there's nothing as gloriously wallowing as ""West Side"" or as unabashedly emotional as ""Out There"".  </p><p>
    The one tune to transcend this dilemma entirely is the remix of ""2 Hearts"", perhaps because Studio have simply replaced one exaggerated song blueprint (moping pseudo-goth British indie rock) with another (ecstatic femme-pop). In fact, Studio's version ends up a better song than the source material, its relative spareness allowing Kylie's performance to shine with an intensity that is undetectable in the original's over-cluttered glam homage. Submerged in Studio's glittering guitar spiderwebs, supremely supine disco beats and endless layers of dub echo, Kylie's vocals are genuinely moving. All the glam ambiguity of the original is sensitively excised from this version: The song's deadpan sarcasm had no place amongst Studio's endless horizons of lovestruck earnestness. More than any other tracks here, ""2 Hearts"" successfully makes the argument for Studio as an in-house band for other pop outfits: a deadly-serious Scandinavian Sly &amp; Robbie, if you will. Hopefully the duo won't be forced to make the choice between backroom boys and rock gods any time soon: More than just about anyone else they deserve to have their cake and eat it too.</p></div>"|11923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11923-yearbook-2/|7.8|Tim Finney

    To call the Goslings' gritty music ""post-apocalyptic"" might be a tad over-dramatic. But there is something destructive and earth-scorching about their hyper-distorted noise/metal. Maybe ""post-disaster"" is more like it: <em>Occasion </em>might not sound like the end of the world, but it definitely sounds like the end of a record collection. Imagine a room destroyed by fire, with only melted LPs of black metal, harsh noise, and heavy shoegaze left behind. Pile the remains onto a turntable, dig a needle into the smoldering muck, and it might sound something like the warped sludge of this Florida duo.</p><p>
    On the surface, the Goslings seem dependent on glitches, ripples, and other anomalies produced when extreme volume overloads amplifiers and recoding equipment. Almost nothing on <em>Occasion</em> is clear; everything is caked in a sonic crust so dense, it's hard to imagine how the original notes and beats would sound on their own. But there's more to what Max and Leslie Soren are doing than technical fuckery. Like other prime abusers of audio reproduction-- Coachwhips, Ariel Pink, Sightings-- they use distortion as a tool rather than a gimmick. Their lumbering songs are inherently distorted, written with warped senses of time and tone that require a muddy environment to thrash around in.</p><p>
    That time warp is the most appealing aspect of <em>Occasion</em>. Most songs seem to randomly speed up, slow down, and hit sonic black holes out of time altogether. ""Motorcade"" sounds like a My Bloody Valentine tune at 16rpm, with big chords stretched into rubbery elastic. The crunchy ""Vitium"" sticks Leslie's howls inside grinding static, while the album's best track, ""Mandy"", is a masterpiece of temporal illusion. At first drums set a regular pulse, but soon the pace deadens, then quickens, then caves in on itself, turning guitar sludge, drum pound, and buried vocals into a tornado of debris.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Occasion</em> might sound like an experimental record, and certainly the Goslings push sonic envelopes. But at heart they are a metal band, and their unit of currency is the dark, heavy riff. They never lose sight of the primal power of elongated chords-- each song can be seen as an attempt to test how durable one big riff and one clanging drum beat can be. The answer is almost always ""very,"" and the mileage the Goslings get out of their sputtering twin engines continues to impress.</p></div>"|11609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11609-occasion/|7.7|Marc Masters

    always open with references to bong water and lava lamps. 
    They are clearly serious musicians, after all, and though their music 
    swims in 1970s head-rock signifiers-- reverbed 
    guitar washes, droning sitars, and drum-circle bongos? Don't mind 
    if I do!-- it builds momentum with an unforced grace and attention to 
    detail that warrants more careful consideration than corny jokes about 
    incense and beanbag chairs allow. But when you decide to name 
    the opening track on your fourth album of warmly pulsing instrumental 
    rock ""Stoned at the Taj Again""-- well, you're just asking for 
    it.</p><p>
    Actually, the stoner-rock tag probably 
    wouldn't bother these guys much. They identify themselves on their 
    MySpace page as-- gasp!-- a <em>jam band</em>, and thoughtfully name-check 
    Pink Floyd right up front, so that we don't have to. The five long-form 
    compositions that comprise <em>Take Refuge In Clean Living</em> all occupy 
    more or less the same languorous headspace and blend together into a 
    pleasantly hypnotic whole. But repeat listens reveal a sturdy musical 
    intelligence upholding the entire affair, which is probably why an album 
    this drowsy never once feels aimless. ""Stoned at the Taj"" builds 
    slowly from a mammoth-sounding two-note synthesizer riff into some delicate 
    pentatonic guitar noodling before the central motif, a hazy four-note 
    sitar refrain, announces itself, and the track launches into a raga-rock 
    rave-up that recalls the Byrds.  (Throughout the album, it should 
    be said, Grails demonstrate the effortless command of faux-Easternisms 
    that only lifelong study of ""Eight Miles High"" and ""Kashmir"" 
    provides.)</p><p>
    Elsewhere, <em>Take Refuge</em> offers 
    a haunted cover of the Ventures' ""11<sup>th</sup> Hour"" that transforms 
    cool surf-rock into windswept desert-rock via a cavern of reverb and 
    an imperial harpsichord; the result could pass off as incidental music 
    for David Lynch's <em>Inland Empire</em>. That air of dark mystery, 
    which pervades the album, is partly due to the skillful arrangements, 
    but also comes from the immaculate mastering and production, which makes 
    heavy use of contrast and lends the appropriate air of otherworldliness.  The best moments on <em>Take Refuge in Clean Living</em> 
    resemble ""a pinch felt in a dream,"" to quote another (far superior) 
    album that takes place in a similar numinous middle distance: <em>Perfect 
    From Now On</em>.
    Grails have been honing their spaghetti-western 
    drone-rock for almost a decade, and have reached a point where 
    they can skillfully fold just about any element into their ambient 
    haze. To say that nothing stands out from the whole on <em>Take Refuge</em> 
    is not so much an insult as it is an observation that Grails have 
    succeeded in their aims, which is to create a full-length that flows 
    uninterrupted from start to finish. There is something charmingly anachronistic 
    about this goal, and it adds to the appealing sense that Grails 
    exist in a kind of time warp.  After all, it was never really considered 
    ""cool"" to make this sort of music, but that hasn't stopped three 
    or four generations of bands from turning down the lights and attempting 
    to craft something resembling a soundscape. And there are moments 
    here-- especially on the quietly gorgeous cello-and-piano coda ""Clean 
    Living""-- where Grails successfully transcend the trappings of 
    their genre and tap into something truly celestial.</p></div>"|11605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11605-take-refuge-in-clean-living/|7.8|Jayson Greene

    Martina Topley Bird, one-time featured vocalist for Tricky, last released an album in 2003, the understated Mercury Prize nominee <em>Quixotic</em>, which seemed to want to pick up where Massive Attack left off. It was mostly melody-free and plodding, but also adventurous, sexy, and different. Five years later, and with production assistance from Danger Mouse, Topley Bird tries her hand at groovy songs built on tinny keyboards, dirty guitars, and organ.</p><p>
    Songs that bring to mind the 1960s referencing of Amy Winehouse and Duffy might please some listeners. Like ""Baby Blue"", for example, which contributes a glittering piano to Topley Bird's feathery vocals. In general, though, her voice isn't strong enough to carry Wino's genre, let alone the song. Like so many of her efforts, this song is too quiet-- the voice muffled by heavy drums, synth beats, and a swathe of effects pedals. Similarly, ""Poison"" and ""Valentine"" also bend to an apparent craving for all-female trios of a bygone era without much success.</p><p>
    ""Shangri La"", along with opener ""Phoenix"", may be the standout here. The mix of violins, organ, and bass is too chaotic, but it's intriguing once the vocals arrive just over a minute in. The chorus-verse format organizes everything into a clean, moving, enjoyable force. The sound of the words, if not their meaning, creates the momentum here: ""When I reach town/ Baby I'm a touchdown/ I see us in the way we are/ And I'm running for a train/ And I'm coming home again/ And then maybe I can slowdown.""
    </p>
<p>
    There is a lot of vertiginous rabbit-hole exploration on <em>The Blue God</em>, and while it might be unfair to suggest this kind of music doesn't fit into the big picture of 2008, well, it really doesn't. There is proof in nearly every genre that listeners just want to dance; the requirement leaves room for every kind of emotion, as long as it's slotted into a tempo of 120 or above. Topley Bird attempts to get things moving multiple times on the album, but the overall effect is one of balladic daydreaming. At those times, her creations are overly delicate, her message lost in compositions that are alternately frothy and sludgy. The Orbison-like ""Valentine"" is pretty, aerated with harmonies and slow guitar strums. But it's still too sleepy-- not just in tempo, but in its ability to create complexities and tiny revolutions from a repeating melody and a diverse set of instruments.

The white suburban kids who idolize gangster rappers are old news, and the rich kids have always loved to rub elbows with the poor. But when a man tries to identify with a woman, he doesn't just hit the normal problems of ""white male gaze"" and ""exploitation of the other"" and ""being a jackass"": There's also the third rail of male sexuality, where identifying too closely with a woman might make you seem, perish the thought, sensitive. So instead, the guys who dig a girl like Liz Phair have to play up the attraction, the lust, the submission to a rock'n'roll goddess-- even when, for many of them, the lust ain't the main draw.</p>
<p>The other tactic is to take credit for what she's done. And guys can take plenty of credit for Phair's early career. Rock critics like Bill Wyman brought Phair to Chicago's attention when they ranted and raved about <i>Guyville</i> weeks before the thing came out. The Rolling Stones recorded <i>Exile on Main Street</i>, the loose template for <i>Guyville</i>'s 18 tracks-- and one of the blues-rock genomes that saved this from being just another singer-songwriter set. And a couple other guys, co-producer Brad Wood and engineer Casey Rice, helped nail the minimalist production of <i>Guyville</i> and its follow-up, the underrated <i>Whip-Smart</i>.</p>
<p>It was the guys like her Johnny or her Joe-- the titular guys in the indie boy's club centered in and around Chicago's Wicker Park-- who preened for her, dicked her over, and taught her how to push back, inspiring her and making it necessary for her to write these songs in the first place. And it was guys who took the piss when she started headlining at venues that were too big for an amateur. Playing a New Year's Eve show at the Metro as your sixth or seventh gig is a lot to bite off. And if I recall correctly, she bit. But stagecraft and starpower weren't the point: Those of us who were taken in by Phair loved her because she was-- sorry to use the word-- real.</p>
<p>Men and women have written paeons to Phair since <i>Guyville</i> was released, putting her swagger, strength, and mundanity in whatever context meant the most to them-- ""girl next door,"" ""older sister,"" ""younger sister,"" ""easy lay,"" ""slut next door,"" ""bitch."" But let's start with ""female rocker."" <i>Guyville</i> still runs up your spine on track one with its full-on opener, ""6'1'"", which is the best song she's ever recorded: tough but exposed, with cute feints in the lyrics, a wicked riff, and the door slamming open on her sassy tomboy vocals. On cuts like these, guys can dig Phair because she's one of the guys.</p>
<p>The songs are mostly sprints or drones, and on relistening to it, it's striking to hear the full-band cuts next to the solitary head space of songs like ""Glory"" or ""Shatter"", where she's backed more by a memory of guitar than by the raunchy blues-rock of the album's other half. The production of the ballads replicates the intimacy of a bedroom recording without the tape hiss or bum notes, which is an awesome illusion; and only a beginning songwriter could make such elemental riffs sound so exciting.</p>
<p>Phair has famously struggled to become a star, and never quite made it. <i>Guyville</i> turned her into an object of fascination, but those early gigs revealed she wasn't a superstar: She had to get by on talent, and perceptiveness. She has the gift of turning everyday downers into rock, and the shock came when she sang about things that nobody else discussed in public.</p>
<p>The cover shot nipple, ""I want to be your blow job queen,"" the outro of ""Fuck and Run"" (""...even when I was 12"")-- this stuff was startling at the time, but I'm guessing it won't register with any teenagers who discover this today. You can get Savage Love right on your cell phone, and young adults today can browse mainstream blogs and read about machines that will fuck you. Sad to say that at the time, it was shocking to talk about non-missionary sex with the girl you could take home to mom, but today, on ""Flower""-- the one about blow jobs-- the line that surprises is her Dungeons &amp; Dragons-like reference to ""minions.” (On the original, she said she'd fuck the guy's girlfriend.)</p>
<p>Also hard to explain would be the sound, which is grey and wedged entirely in the midrange. When a ""remastered"" edition was announced, I had to wonder if the remasterer had actually heard the thing before taking the job-- but hearing it now, the treatment works: the rhythm section, when there is one, has more punch, and Phair's vocals come a little closer to your earlobe. The package also comes with a poorly-made DVD of interviews that Phair conducted with people from Chicago who knew her when-- Steve Albini, Ira Glass, the Urge Overkill guys. It makes a scene that fancied itself ""the next Seattle"" seem exactly as insular and provincial as it really was.</p>
<p>More useful would have been a tighter focus on Phair-- say, a better set of her B-sides and demos. Would it have killed ATO to throw in more of her early, even less-inhibited Girly Sounds material? Three B-sides grace this reissue, including the meandering ""Ant in Alaska"" and a curious cover of Lynn Tait's ""Say You"".  They're nice throwaways, but they explain little about what was going on around the making of her debut.</p>
<p>Fifteen years on, <i>Guyville</i> occasionally sounds dated-- for its particular sexiness, and its particular indieness. But the songwriting holds up. She ticks off all the bruises and embarrassments of relationships, and never lets her defenses get in the way. Naturally as a guy, I can't speak for what women saw in the record back then, or how young women will take it now. But of all the albums written from a woman's perspective, this is one of the most accessible to men. It's intriguing to watch her deal with us-- not as a mere revolutionary, but as someone who knows that sex will always be tough, so she always has to be tougher. She's been tested in ways we never will be, and we understand just enough to admire her for it. Men don't get what it's like to be a woman. But spinning this record, you swear that you could.</p></div>"|11921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11921-exile-in-guyville-15th-anniversary/|9.6|Chris Dahlen

    With a few exceptions (including, but not limited to, his wiry and emotional debut album <em>Alcachofa</em>, the gorgeous <em>Achso </em>EP, and many of his perkier remixes), Ricardo Villalobos has spent the past five years or so mining that corner of minimal house where ""nothing happening"" becomes a happening, uncovering moments of magic-eye shifts in perception when privation is transformed into an embarrassment of riches. Last year's <em>Fabric 36</em>, a mixed-together compendium of new Villalobos productions, pushed this absence-excess dynamic to its extremes, its delirium of quietly overlapping rhythms and uncomfortable vocal samples verging on being too-much of that not-enough that constitutes the producer's odd charm. I use ""charm"" deliberately here: The word ""genius"" gets bandied about just a little <em>too </em>easily with this guy, though you can see what people are aiming for when they make the claim. There's an inscrutable quality to Ricardo's music that makes him seem way ahead of any curve you're on, and this sense of a higher intelligence is seductive even when the music fails to be. ""It's not him,"" I've often thought when a particular Villalobos track has left me cold, ""it's <em>me</em>.""</p><p>
    Villalobos seems to be pushing the less-is-more line further and further these days; but then, he's getting better at it, or at least more fluent. With his latest double-LP release <em>Vasco EP Part 1</em> (yep, that's two pieces of vinyl for four tracks, and it's only <em>part one</em>) he retreats slightly from the through-the-wormhole (or at least k-hole) antics of <em>Fabric 36 </em>and its sister vinyl release <em>Sei Es Drum</em>, for a partial return to basic house principles. But unlike the compulsive swing of his recent remix of Shinedoe's ""Phunk"", or his remarkably catchy, hype-inducing DJ tool ""Enfants (Chants)"", <em>Vasco </em>has no truck with house's traditional pleasures.</p><p>
    On ""Minimoonstar"", one of two new productions included, melody is abandoned almost entirely, in favor of rippling drums and a quirky, xylophone-like bassline that slides around uneasily for 13 minutes. Taken as a whole, its radical uneventfulness is perverse, but at any given moment the sheer delicacy of its sound (in particular its bruised, radioactive bass tones) is bewitching. Still, it's hard not to suspect that Villalobos' increasingly hardline stance against structure, dynamic, and linearity is undermining the execution somewhat: <em>""</em>Minimoonstar""<em> </em>crests at about six minutes, with eerie ambient washes giving a sense of significance-- if not exactly purpose-- to its aimless meanderings; but Villalobos then seems to shy away from the pathos he hints towards, drifting instead into doldrums of fitful kicks whose game-faced emptiness is frustrating more than enigmatic. His reluctance to force emotions onto his audience is noble in some ways, but as listeners sometimes we need to be manipulated. 
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps this sense of trailing off wouldn't be so stark if <em>Vasco </em>didn't include a stunning remix of ""Minimoonstar"" by Shackleton, the erstwhile dubstep producer now increasingly determined to beat all the Germans at their own games. While never seeming overtly structured, Shackleton's remix drifts organically through several movements that build in intensity with a lethal grace. As with his own recent track ""Death Is Not Final"", here he uses a pulsing 4X4 kickdrum less as a concession to house groove than as a nominal structure around which his rhythmic excursions can roam even more willfully than before: the astonishing middle section contrasts a solemn house pulse with ringing and melodramatic widescreen percussive patterns that sound like stones skipping across the surface of a bottomless lake, unabashedly evoking a kind of spiritual agoraphobia.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite its title, Villalobos' second track, ""Electronic Water"", is by far the less fluid, opting for an awkward, fidgety groove that promises less but ultimately delivers more, its wired-up nervousness culminating in a closing stretch of compulsive computer funk that's as smile-inducing as anything in the producer's back catalogue. Still shunning melody or emotion, ""Electronic Water"" at least embraces narrative, moving logically from near-formless substance towards a semblance of chattering electro that's pure form. Remixer San Proper takes this idea further, enclosing the entire thing in a cavernous but insistent house groove that sacrifices little if any of the original's unpredictable rhythmic spikiness. Villalobos acolytes will doubtless make sneering references to functionalism and hidebound DJs-- you'll know them because they will be unable to say anything bad about anything Villalobos has ever done-- which misses the point somewhat: A good deal of the attraction of the original ""Electronic Water"" lies in how it almost seems to yearn towards becoming proper house, its rhythms probing blindly for some kind of stable reference. 
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, taken together, Shackleton and San Proper's efforts feel like the logical conclusions that Villalobos deliberately leaves off the page, although they're conclusions that tend in opposite directions, with San Proper embracing sensuality and Shackleton thematic soundscaping. <em>Vasco </em>is not an album for the uninitiated, or for those looking for another way into the producer's bewildering and labyrinthine aesthetic; it's less an album than a survey, less a statement than a question mark. If Villalobos' hypnotic excursions into ""nothing happening"" are by now their own genre-- and let's accept that they are-- then <em>Vasco </em>asks what kind of nothing we want to happen, and whether Villalobos is the guy to give it to us. Shackleton carries the day here (if only just) because he reminds us of how devastating Villalobos himself can be when he's prepared to meet us halfway, still ahead of the curve, but glancing back to where we are, and trying to put into words we'll understand the indescribable things he's seen.

Is it something that comes up after years of sample-searching, where months upon months' worth of listening hours and beat dismantling spur a fascination with the original soul or jazz product via reverse-engineering osmosis? Or is it just a growing disenchantment with the idea of plugging away at ProTools? Whatever the motivation, Ninja Tune's longtime resident hip-hop geeks Ollie Teeba and Jake Wherry-- better known as the Herbaliser-- took a gradual but noticeable shift into live-band dynamics over the course of their decade-and-a-half career, solidifying their current incarnation of horn-driven pop-funk bombast on 2005's <em>Take London</em> and finding themselves right at the center of the nu-Swingin' London retro-soul maelstrom that Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse belatedly became the faces of.</p><p>
    It's an interesting place for the Herbaliser to wind up, but it's also a perilous one: as one of the more straightforward and unassuming groups to come out of the otherwise avant-blunted mid-late 1990s Ninja Tune camp, their sense of populist feel-goodery only gets more lapel-grabbingly eager-to-please when you factor in blaring brass and Nixon-age demi-kitsch. Like <em>Take London</em>, there's some points on their first post-Ninja Tune release, <em>Same As It Never Was</em>, that threaten to suffocate you in a chortling wave of self-aware schmaltz, like some kind of Mike Myers version of Lalo Schifrin or the John Barry Orchestra. Dopey genre-film-score homages like the cop-show lite-funk clichés of ""Blackwater Drive"" or the bumbling Benny Hill mugging of ""Amores Bongo"" don't radiate much excitement or smarts -- sure, they're kind of funny-ha-ha, but ultimately frivolous and cheesy enough to damage initial impressions of what would otherwise be a well-assembled work of inoffensively likeable pop-funk revivalism.</p><p>
    Fortunately, those moments are just speed bumps, and better failed levity than failed grandiosity anyways. When Jake, Ollie, and the Easy Access Orchestra horn section (Andrew Ross and Ralph Lamb) consolidate their efforts into less goofy turf, they come across like a solid set of compatriots to your typical Daptone Records band, sporting a chameleonic modular-soul versatility that doesn't strain too hard to fit into hip-hop turf. Whenever they're playing behind a vocalist, which they do for the majority of the record, they stick to providing a solid backbone and let all the attention focus on whoever's got the mic. So you get Jean Grae, who goes back with the Herbaliser over a decade, fitting a novella's (or a screenplay's) worth of fraternal betrayal and true-crime intricacy inside ""Street Karma (A Cautionary Tale)""-- and suddenly the cop-show vibe that made ""Blackwater Drive"" come across sort of flippantly sounds a lot more intense this time around. And even if the epic-Western tone makes the bounce of ""Just Won't Stop"" sound a bit off, Yungun's sympathetic Luddite laments over YouTube culture and record-shop closings give it some gravity.

    Then there's Jessica Darling, who appears on five of <em>Same As It Never Was</em>' twelve tracks and gives the album much of its character. A 22-year-old Londoner who sings a bit like a Southern U.S. r&amp;b vet in her late fifties, it's kind of a disconnect to hear her go all Jean Knight on some assorted Mssrs. Big Stuff in ""You're Not All That"" or paraphrasing Smokey Robinson's lyrics for ""Get Ready"" on ""Can't Help This Feeling"". But the displacement in era and culture and continent aren't really what makes her voice surprisingly appealing-- she just sounds comfortably fierce and high-energy, a belter who's a little too raspy and rough for your more polite coffeehouses (though closer ""Stranded on Earth"" proves she can work chillout duty just fine). Even as the post-Winehouse fragmentation of nu-soul drops artists into bleached pockets of mannered, by-the-numbers nostalgia (have they green-lit <em>The Commitments II</em> yet?), <em>Same As It Never Was</em> at least risks something-- and when it's not tripping over its clownish go-go boots, it makes a good-enough case for going all the way live.

Factor in that he's a prolific bugger-- appearing in any number of bands, combos, and permutations, playing any number of styles with any degree of commercial or artistic aspirations-- and that's a whole lot of context bogging down his constantly expanding discography. <em>A Perfect Place</em>, for example, is presented as the original motion picture soundtrack to the film of the same name. The art is laid out like a lost Italian thriller, replete with dramatic stills bathed in red. And if the soundtrack weren't packaged with a copy of the film itself, one would be forgiven for presuming the music provided only the theoretical score to a movie that existed only in Patton's mind.</p><p>
    The film (written and directed by one Derrick Scocchera, co-founder of Fantoma Films, who last year released a couple of volumes of Kenneth Anger works) is a droll, fitfully funny hardboiled noir/black comedy hybrid, shot in 'Scope and presented it black and white. It also runs just a short 25 minutes. Patton's released score, on the other hand, runs ten minutes over that, which may show where the priorities lie. It's a Patton soundtrack with a bonus DVD, not the other way around.</p><p>
    Patton, of course, is a huge film score buff. His band Fantomas pays tribute to the greats (by way of chamber metal), and his Ipecac label released a useful sampler of less than obvious Ennio Morricone music. Predictably, Morricone looms large over much the score, as does the influence of someone like Henry Mancini in Latin jazz/tiki mode, and if the music plays a subtle role in <em>A Perfect Place</em>, Scocchera constantly calls attention to it in the most conspicuous of ways, primarily through its characters fiddling with radios.
    </p><p>
    ""What is that?"" asks one guy as the other scans the dial of a car radio.
    </p>
<p>
    ""I don't know,"" the other guys responds. ""I've never heard it before. Should I change it?""
    </p>
<p>
    ""Eh, keep it on,"" says the first guy. ""I kind of like it.""
    </p>
<p>
    Subtle the diegetic nod is not. Fortunately, Patton's score isn't nearly as in your face. That cue in question, ""A Perfect Place"", features twang guitar, whistling, and the occasional synth squelch, and sounds right out of the world of Il Maestro. The two cues called ""Car Radio"" are basically just static filled runs across the fuzzy dial, pausing briefly on a number of diverse and strange snippets, while manic percussion occasionally gives a jazzy edge to some of the other cues. The lounge rock of ""A Perfect Twist"" features Patton on vocals, but most of the remaining score veers away from pop and plops instead into the infinitely deep pool of pop culture and kitsch.
    </p>
<p>
    Even more than Morricone, Patton mentor John Zorn and his own eclectic, semi-experimental soundtracks inform Patton's explorations. Zorn, of course, has released several compilations of Filmworks, collections of music written for films both released and unreleased, obscure and even more obscure. Listening to Patton's bits and pieces, most of which don't hit the three-minute mark, it's easy to imagine him following suit. Surely the guy must have hours of this stuff stowed away. All he needs now, with <em>A Perfect Place</em> as a sort of self-contained calling card, is a few dozen filmmakers giving him a ring to justify unleashing it all.

It's true, and it bodes poorly for hacks like me, because at this point Kidz in the Hall-- an Ivy League-educated underground rap group signed to Buckshot's label-- have generated such a strong buzz that they're pretty much set. They did it through a slew of celebrity collaborations and a hilarious video, ""Drivin' Down the Block (Low End Theory)"", which has gotten much-deserved TRL airplay. The album-closing remix of the song featuring Pusha T, Bun B, and the Cool Kids is quite good as well, and the version floating around produced by and featuring El-P is even better.</p><p>
    Fine. But this is not a great backpack hip-hop album. Everyone complains about Naledge's shortcomings as an MC, but more unfortunate is his lyrical aversion to clever turns of phrase. There's nothing here as half as imaginative or witty as ""Cappuccino"", the breakout track from L.A. rappers the Knux, a duo often compared to the Kidz. As Peter Macia noted in his spot-on Pitchfork review of the guys' last record, <em>School Was My Hustle</em>: ""There's little evidence that school was actually their hustle."" And indeed the album's lyrical anemia is all the more surprising considering their Penn degrees.</p><p>
    The cringe-worthy lines could fill a whole song: ""Ride tracks sort of like a NASCAR"" (from ""Paper Trail""); ""My car like a Shop Rite, got cheese, got bread, yeah yeah I shop right"" (from ""Drivin' Down the Block""); ""I think I love her, but I think I hate her at the very same time"" (from ""Love Hangover""). The beats are less urgent this time around as well. There's nothing that equals the power of <em>Hustle</em> tracks ""Ms. Juanita"", ""Wassup Jo'"", or ""Ritalin"". Double-O's tracks are breezy, nostalgic, and serviceable throughout, but don't stick in your head.</p><p>
    ""In the spirit of Jimi, Rick James, and James Brown,"" Naledge announces at the beginning of ""Lucifer's Joyride"", but a more accurate characterization would be ""in the spirit of Gym Class Heroes,"" the current MTV Hits darlings who also play lip service to the greats but water their shit down with clumsy innuendo such as when Naledge encouraging us to ""get a little drunk, get a little naked. Let's go where the wind takes us."" (Are we in a boat?)</p><p>
    ""Lucifer's Joyride"" has little Jimi, Rick, or James, but it does have just about everything else-- vocoder; allusions to drugs, gambling, and prostitution; a soul sample so drowned out you can barely hear it, and of course Gym Class Heroes' Travis McCoy, who is better at doing what he does than these guys are. With their frantic, rushed rhymes, and beats which are a bit too eager to please, the Kidz may be popular. But if they want to any cred they're going to have to learn to be themselves.</p></div>"|11514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11514-the-in-crowd/|5.5|Ben Westhoff

    The pedal-pushing droners Double Leopards and heavy rock deconstructionists Mouthus are two of the best noise groups around. Not coincidentally, they're also two of the closest, having shared a practice space and performed together frequently. So it was pretty exciting when the two bands merged to form White Rock, with Double Leopards' Mike Bernstein and Maya Miller joining Mouthus' Brian Sullivan and Nate Nelson. Their 2005 album <em>Tarpit</em> (named after their communal quarters) mixed enveloping soundscapes with disjointed sludge, approaching the best work of either band.</p><p>
    Religious Knives, another Mouthus/Double Leopards collaboration, is a different proposition, but one that's becoming even more exciting. The group began as the trio of Bernstein, Miller, and Nelson (bassist Todd Cavallo has since joined in), and are a much more conventional group than White Rock. With Bernstein on guitar and vocals, Miller on organ, and Nelson on a more standard drum kit than the electronic-acoustic hybrid he plays in Mouthus, the band even looks like a power trio on stage. This is a sharp contrast to Double Leopards, who crouch around their instruments and prefer to face each other rather than the audience.</p><p>
    The first few Religious Knives releases were rather noisy, but hints of melody and beat gradually slipped in. Following that path, the group has now found its strongest voice, a 1960s-ish trance-jam sound touching on garage, krautrock, and even Doors-style organ-pop (it's telling that a recent live CD includes a cover of ? and the Mysterians' ""96 Tears""). Atop Nelson's looping rhythms and Miller's hypnotic chords, Bernstein-- an unabashed fan of Neil Young and the Grateful Dead-- pours his guitar like syrup over pancakes, and moans like a vampire afraid of sunlight. The result is the musical equivalent of a slow-rolling storm cloud. Religious Knives songs seem to hang in the air and move forward, leaving thick trails of echo behind.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Resin</em> is their best record yet. Compiled from singles, split releases, and live sets, it has the coherence of a studio album. The best songs offer simple melodies rising like beams of light through fog: ""Everything Happens Twice"" melts Nelson's marching beat into a Can-like jam, while ""The Sun"" fuses Miller's Manzarek-ish chords to swaying fuzz. Even the album's loosest tracks-- like the open-ended ""Twelve Bottles and One White Cone""-- have an urgency that's oddly catchy. Religious Knives' affinity for drone is never far away, but the melodies are what make Resin so enticing.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>It's After Dark</em>, recorded by the trio version of the band and produced by Samara Lubelski at Rare Book Room Studios, opens with the same kind of blood-flow that <em>Resin</em> courses with. ""In Brooklyn After Dark"" chugs forward for 11 dense minutes, as Bernstein hums stoned musings about the band's home: ""In Brooklyn after dark/ The helicopters are the birds...The children all have gray hair/ They stare and stare and stare and stare.""
    </p>
<p>
    But the rest of the album isn't quite so energetic. Most tracks are slow and subdued, with Nelson's beats more relaxed, and Bernstein and Miller sounding generally dreamier. Even a different version of ""The Sun"" meanders in comparison to <em>Resin</em>'s strident take. Not that Religious Knives aren't good at being mellow-- the haunted-house jam ""It's Hot"" and the Terry Riley-esque ""Noontime"" are mesmerizing enough to dilate any eyes. But <em>It's After Dark </em>is just a bit more uniform, just a bit less urgent, than <em>Resin</em>. Still, these two releases are the band's peak so far, and show a growth that suggests they too will be bested, and probably soon.<br/>

    Back in 2006, an opera student from New York City named Rachel Zevita auditioned for
    ""American Idol"". Armed with a bright personality and even brighter hippie
    duds, she convincingly sang Jeff Buckley's ""Eternal Life"" and lite-soul classic ""Get Here"", along with some glass-shattering opera blasts. It was not your typical ""Idol""
    try-out. At the end of the eclectic vocal exhibition, Simon Cowell
    asked her: ""Who would you like to be?"" If Shara Worden-- the
    opera-trained leader of New York City's My Brightest Diamond-- was a
    little younger and a lot more desperate for attention, she could've been that ""Idol""
    oddity. Able to tackle everything from a drum 'n' bass version of ""When
    Doves Cry"" to a foot-stomping take on Nina Simone's ""Be My Husband"" to a
    karaoke-hustling ""I Will Always Love You"" with shocking ease live, Worden's voice is one of the most astounding in all of
    indie rock. But, after listening to her dark, impressionistic sophomore
    album and then watching her crack bassoon jokes and mimic Michael Jackson at
    a recent show, I'm left with the same question as Cowell: Who would
    Shara Worden like to be?</p><p>
    According to MBD's head-snapping debut, <em>Bring Me the Workhorse</em>, the
    singer-songwriter-arranger-musical omnivore wanted to be the female
    Jeff Buckley with a more pronounced perfectionist bent and without sex.
    She brooded about unspeakable terribleness, dead bugs,
    talking dragonflies and glue factory-bound horses with the seriousness
    of a ghostly naturalist. Even more, she turned what should've been an
    overreaching neo-transcendental nightmare into something even the most
    protective Buckley-phile would swoon over. Worden's heady, music school
    talents were apparent but not overbearing and she tempered her flower
    child side with considerable menace. The first track on <em>A Thousand
    Shark's Teeth</em>, ""Inside a Boy"", continues with this winning formula. The
    rest of the album does not.</p><p>
    Originally conceived as a record full of string quartet pieces, <em>Shark's
    Teeth</em> was always bound to be a riskier affair than the more straightforward
    <em>Workhorse</em>. Though the strings-only mandate fell by the wayside
    somewhere along the LP's six-year gestation, its Debussy-inspired
    impressionistic flourishes remain. Songs often sidestep repetitive structures in favor of more meandering paths. Woodwinds and
    strings follow elaborate charts. These more mannered
    experiments start off curiously pleasing.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Ice and the Storm"" quickly
    rebukes the infatuation of ""Inside a Boy"" as it chronicles the
    quivering finale of a relationship with human nature intact: ""I want a
    storm to blow it out/ I want to shake myself and turn my heart inside
    out,"" wails Worden, while all sorts of harps, choirs and skittering
    snares turn her wants into realities. ""If I Were Queen"", meanwhile, lovingly mixes
    the fantastical with the mundane. Over delicate strings, Worden uses
    her hypothetical royalty to bring a distant loved one closer just so
    they can ""collect things and argue where to put them"" together. The
    playful ""Apples"" somehow makes folding clothes sexy, and album
    centerpiece ""From the Top of the World"" is the most exquisite thing on the disc, its celestial marriage vows working in perfect tandem with an
    immaculate symphony underneath. The latter half of the record
    quickly falls into a mid tempo malaise, though, with Worden's ethereal
    references to the heavens growing staler with each overly precious
    arrangement. The first part of the nearly seven minute ""To
    Pluto's Moon"" sounds like a sub par tribute to Björk's insular
    masterpiece <em>Vespertine</em>, while the second part veers dangerously close
    to trip-hop wallpaper. The indulgences begin to overwhelm and, by the
    end of the album, Worden's fantastical charm turns itself inside out. It's too posed for its own good.
    </p>
<p>
    Frustratingly, what should be the album's best song isn't on the album.
    A recent live favorite, ""The Gentlest Gentleman"" is available only as a
    bonus track on iTunes (it's also currently streaming for free on MBD's
    site). Thematically, the exclusion makes sense; ""Gentleman"" is a
    stunningly simple ukulele ditty that goes down easy after <em>Shark's
    Teeth</em>'s orchestral intricacies. It's also the most direct My Brightest
    Diamond song to date, with Worden saying goodbye to a loved one with
    understated grace. ""If this is to be the end well, hey, that's it,"" she shrugs, resigned but resilient. A creative chameleon with endless wells
    of technical skill, Worden stuffs <em>Shark's Teeth</em> with studied know-how. ""Gentleman"" bypasses such careful intelligence-- it gives the
    singer away more than a thousand of violins ever could.

    Please, stop right there. Certainly by now, you've noticed the numerical rating several pixels above this second sentence, and you're already thinking, ""Another 7.something. No time for this."" Your pointer is above the back button, your finger on the trigger. Don't do it, please: Over the past two months, I've listened to <em>The Ken Burns Effect</em>, the second proper record from New York-centered collective Stars Like Fleas, about 50 times, and I'm about as close to offering a conclusion now as I was around spin five. The number above is a suggestion to listen but also a waiver to go right back to your Fleet Foxes or Lil Wayne if need be. That is, it's an absolute indication of quality, not a guarantee you'll find your new favorite band. <em>The Ken Burns Effect </em>is one of the year's most ambitious and daring records, blessed, beset and united by the desire to steer clear of indie rock's middle road, to be ambitiously good. It loses and wins big, sometimes in the same song, sometimes in the same verse. But, at the very least, just as you shouldn't pass on a band because of an inane name like Stars Like Fleas, records this cared for shouldn't be skipped because of a rating. Sometimes, I think <em>The Ken Burns Effect </em>deserves a 10.0. Sometimes, it feels like a 2.0. You might hate it. You might love it. But you need to hear it.</p><p>
    Stars Like Fleas deals mostly in symphonic pop de-/reconstructions, building around the words of co-architect Montgomery Knott with elaborate stacks of melodies and slingshot maneuvers that dart through seemingly linear movements. No moment of <em>The Ken Burns Effect</em> suggests the path of least resistance. Even the band's pop ideal, the three-minute ""Berbers in Tennis Shoes"", twists contexts and introduces unease. ""Berbers"" bounces to a steady, springy rhythm, and wide, arching horn-and-string arrangements lift its four sections up and along. But such relative rhythmic stability clashes with the song's broader sonic dual: Banjo, glockenspiel, harp, flute, and a flugelhorn guide the melody along, but a current of dissonance-- occasional sharps and flats from the pretty instruments and an electric guitar that threatens to raze the whole thing with noise-- runs like a bright blue vein beneath otherwise unblemished skin. And Knott isn't selling you on empty sentiments, either: ""Have you slept with your fill of men?"" he asks acerbically, later indicting with the suggestion, ""Money saved for those who were fucking you."" Similarly, ""Karma's Hoax"", which opens the album after a collagist introduction, pits skittering drums and squawking bass clarinet and baritone saxophone beneath beautiful dream-like vocals, pedal steel moans and patient piano chords. The drums and horns temporarily overrun the song's softer side, slapping at the theme like Albert Ayler letting ""Spirits Rejoice"" with Fred Frith and Joey Baron.</p><p>
    Fortunately, Stars Like Fleas don't use their philosophy of flourishes just to corrode or provide wrinkles. ""I Was Only Dancing"" is a simple country-ish creeper-- steady drums, banjo, and acoustic guitar gliding under Knott. He sounds most comfortable somewhere between Dave Matthews and Chris Martin, quietly insistent but capable of rising into choral resplendence when needed. The band forces his voice here, and, in turn, they help deliver one of the record's best moments. Even though Knott's words indicate deep desperation, the chorus-- lifted by good company-- sounds like the darkest clouds broken by the brightest sunlight must look. Continuing sounds possible, enjoyable even. And there's ""Falstaff"", which reads less like a ""song"" and more an like elliptical, illusory verse entwined into a glorious musical setting. Those free drums return, dispersing the rhythm into a gorgeous matrix of sound. Trilled violins flash low in the mix. Single piano notes rise, hover, dissipate. Sharp dobro licks cut through it all, like a sharp knife made gorgeous by craftsmanship. Even without vocals, you'd never forget ""Falstaff"" and its strangely interlocking whorls. 
    </p>
<p>
    Those compositional complexities and wormholes stem somewhat from the band's foundation and evolution. Stars Like Fleas has long been Knott and Shannon Fields, together forming ideas, then organizing a sprawling core of part-time members and collaborators to expand them. No less than 21 people-- from Sam Amidon and Espers' Jesse Sparhawk to former Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn-- contribute to <em>The Ken Burns Effect</em>. While most of the additions work, such loose collaboration is the double-edged sword that likely shaved the number up top that everybody's so worried about. Some of the ideas feel slightly pedantic-- like an (admittedly accomplished) microtonal drone that introduces ""Toast Siren""-- or even lazy, like the token electronic beat that rattles after the drums on ""You Are My Memoir"". By adding too much to a song, Stars Like Fleas occasionally diminish the mass of their own accomplishments, reducing the gravity of the best moments. You're left floating. Moving quickly from one allusion or clipped phrase to the next, Knott's words sometimes do the same. Eventually, though the band will bring you back.

On his solo record <em>Ghost Town</em>, he's using many of those same glassy, treble-heavy electronic tones, but just as P&amp;L can replace guitar and bass with unfamiliar sqeals, Friel goes further and replaces the drums, the vocals, and pretty much the whole band with the wheeze and skronk of electronic instruments.</p><p>
    Even as he abandons traditional rock instruments, he bends his new toys to the particular vision of his better-known band-- that is, to twist noise until it's basically pop. Opening track ""Ghost Town Pt. 1"" builds slowly from honking and sputtering into a thunderous bass chug, setting a rhythm that almost overwhelms its prideful 8-bit-like theme. That same deep, distorted bass is the bedrock of ""Desert Song"", though its melody is woozier and less distinct than the album opener; high-pitched whistles mark out more video-game territory, but they slide in and out of tune as the cascading mechanical beats take the foreground. ""Buzzards"" is almost a pocket-sized rave, its rhythm relentless, its keyboards drunkenly melodic, its background whistling and wheezing demanding more and more. The quiet ring of ""Ghost Town Pt. 2"" has a dog-whistle melody countered by a theremin-like tone, but they fold over each other and slowly recede into another ear-piercer and hip-shaker. From its extended intro to its slow-burning melody matched to a tireless rhythm, it's a distinctly rock move that unfolds like many of P&amp;L's monster singles.</p><p>
    But <em>Ghost Town</em> is far more than just demos for Friel's other band, which you can tell from its forays into a more desolate and mournful atmosphere. The hiccuping ringtone beat of ""One Legged Cowboy"" could fit in with the minimal, melodic IDM Thom Yorke ventured into on his solo album, and its quiet whistles are lonely and almost kitschy as the track's open space begins to evoke the album's title. The same goes for closing track ""Horse Heaven"", which could almost soundtrack the closing scenes of a Western with its low-battery siren melody augmented by far-away church organ over the slow, inevitable march of its rhythm. As it is with Friel's day job, your mileage with this may vary depending on either how you noisy you like your pop, or how poppy you like your noise. However, the fact that Friel has accomplished the same ends in a much more difficult context, all while adding his own distinctive and personal touch, is no small feat.</p></div>"|11918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11918-ghost-town/|7.6|Jason Crock

Papers scattered and walls sea-green in morning light, it's the type of squat-able city residence you'd expect to find an art collective haunting. The photos serve Twine's inviting electronic scribbles well, but unlike some of their sound-art peers-- Fennesz, Tim Hecker, Gastr Del Sol-- whose work suggests entropy or decay, Twine's compositions sound like careful reconstructions of the decayed. A mix of twitching electronics, long, semi-coherent samples, and lapping melodic figures, <em>Violets</em> suggests painting a wall to peel or building stairs to creak.</p><p>
    Like a peek into the off-limits bedroom of a high school crush, much of <em>Violets</em> serves as fascinating melancholy. Snippets of voice, both sampled and recorded, float in and out of the album's chambers, vying for time with doped-down rhythm tracks and slo-mo guitar. On their fourth album and second for Ghostly International, Greg Malcolm and Chad Mossholder have mastered these atmosphere-heavy pills, to the point where ""there's nothing new under the sun"" would be apt criticism if any part of <em>Violets</em>-- save its cover art-- suggested the sun would come out tomorrow. The penultimate ""Lightrain"" uses a now-anachronistic answering machine, the device's junkyard destiny straining its recordings far more than the curtain of buzz and dewy piano they're forced to fight through. Two female guest vocalists-- Alison Shaw (of Cranes) and Gail Schadt-- offer mostly seamless cooing as a windy reprieve from <em>Violets</em>' claustrophobia.</p><p>
    But while Twine clearly seek to ply their doom with disconnected voices, their discordant, mordant guitar work is the battery that powers <em>Violets</em>. ""Disconnected"" is the simplest track here, but it offers a weird inversion of melody/rhythm relationship: a pendulous electric guitar-- one that wouldn't be out of place on one of fellow Ohioan Jason Molina's doom-folk records-- strains out chords in slow-clap time while a combustible beat sputters on like its drum machine blew a sparkplug. The title track places a preacher under trance-metal guitar while a xylophone-synth line offers the tiniest of sonic counterpoints. It is indicative of <em>Violets</em>' overarching mood that opener ""Small"" features a barely ascendant melody line that plays under a recording of heavy rain. Whatever its pieces, Twine's compositions rarely disguise their origins: instruments, voices, and electronics remain mostly separate. <em>Violets</em> can seem fatigued and depressed without reason or release, but its hardships are lessened because Twine always allow listeners insight into their structure.
    </p><p>
    ""Longsided"" condenses Twine's strengths and failings: the track begins with a rough male voice bitching about lodging over a phone. Over the next seven minutes the track ping-pongs between industrial noise, ominous drone, and glitchy beats. It's a fucking mess, and it highlights a sense of restlessness that runs through <em>Violets</em>: tracks like ""Counting Off Again"" and ""Piano"" from Twine's eponymous 2003 album found a hard-won compromise between familiar atmosphere and sonic ingenuity. <em>Violets</em> seems to abandon the latter half of that deal, sounding relatively conventional, or at least as conventional as a band can be inside the realm of sweaty, mush-brained sound dramas. At their best, Twine can sound like they're matting Silly Putty against the Books and then stretching and distorting the resultant print, using their beefy track lengths to elongate the silences between words and flirt with numbing repetition. <em>Violets</em> offers plenty more of these weirdly personal in-betweens, but they're starting to feel less weird.

Over the course of two albums, this unselfconsciously cute and     relentlessly earnest quintet has emitted     rainbows of their own, delivering exuberant, glittery folk-pop that's bursting     with childlike joy and a sincere appreciation for the sloppy, big-hearted     wonder of youth. They are a warm-and-fuzzy respite from an indie rock world     that's overburdened with too-serious bands trying to make self-important ""art""-- this is, after all, a group with a tap-dancing percussionist-- though their whimsical songs are infused with raucous energy and real     emotion. And while their third full-length (called <i>O</i> for the shape of the frame     that holds the nameless album's cover artwork) features their most mature songwriting     yet, these Peter Pans are still committed to an innately innocent sound that's     free of pretense and full of spontaneity and ingenuity.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i> O</i> expands upon Jamie Pressnall's arsenal of tap-shoe     percussion, embracing group stomping, cymbals, and live drums to fill out the rhythm     section while exploring new ways to manipulate and record their tried-and-true     tap sound. With this newfound rhythmic depth, the Tillys' five songwriters can     take chances on a few harder-edged tracks. On ode to schoolyard smack-talking ""Pot     Kettle Black"", which was recorded in a local school's gym with a 10-person     stomp group, the band matches its marching beats with a tough electric guitar     melody that struts and stops abruptly, overshadowing its usually     lighthearted, buzzy synths. Singer Kianna Alarid, who has always used her girlishly     feisty voice to a cheerleader-y effect, unleashes her inner Karen O, wringing     distortion from her mic with her acidic, kittenish tones to match the garage-rock     assault of the music. And ""Too Excited"", the album's other ""aggressive"" (by     Tilly's tender standards) guitar gem, opens with Pressnall's extended tapping     intro and evolves into snotty, defiant cacophony that includes a group cheer of     a chorus and the dropping of multiple f-bombs. But even on these tracks, amidst     their rowdier rhythms and steelier guitars, the Tillys maintain the playful <span class=""me"">naïveté</span> for which they are known.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Despite the evolution of their sound, Tilly and the Wall     haven't forgotten about what made them appealing in the first place: bright co-ed harmonies, rousing choruses, and their overall open-hearted     good nature. And so they lure you into this rich, multi-dimensional collection     with opener ""Tall Tall Grass"", which wouldn't have sounded out of place on     their debut. The soaring acoustic number starts out spare, but uses the dreamy     interplay between Alarid and Neely Jenkins' sweetly sassy sopranos to take     flight amidst a stately piano line and a surprisingly reverb-heavy guitar solo.     And elsewhere the band gives in to their penchant for big, sing-along hooks and     glorious, celebratory noise. Both ""Jumbler"", which is built on handclaps and     off-kilter piano melodies and is studded with horn slides, and the aptly named ""Cacophony"", which makes the most of the band's wealth of vocal talent by layering tangy three-part     harmonies over Pressnall's galloping rhythms and some revival tambourines, will     remind listeners why they fell in love with this charming band: Because     Tilly and the Wall aren't jaded or studiously cool or blasé. Because they know it feels     good to stomp your feet and scream at the top of your lungs. Because they haven’t lost their connection to the emotional freedom of childhood-- that     moment in time when you feel the rawness of your emotions, but haven't learned to be     ashamed of them yet.</p></div>"|11619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11619-o/|7.6|Rebecca Raber

    exercises in maximal minimalism, shaping deceptively simple ingredients
    into textural edifices.  Yet they're full of space and nakedness. 
    Neurosis' songs require patience, with long periods of brooding before
    big, bloody payoffs.  Kelly and Von Till's solo acoustic careers are
    really not that different from Neurosis.  They're quieter, of course,
    but they simply distill the band's concerns-- earth, wind, fire, soul-- to their barest essences.  Music need not sound heavy to be heavy.</p><p>
    Kelly's <em>The Wake</em>
    relies heavily on this principle.  It's mostly just his voice and
    guitar.  The former is appealingly husky, while the latter is starkly
    minimal.  This pairing yields a beauty that's a little bare sometimes. 
    Despite their transparent presentation, the lyrics are oblique: ""The
    patterns bring truth/ The stars bring vengeance/ The reasons unknown/  There is no why.""  Such abstraction can feel wispy, though at times
    Kelly's guitar gives the songs meat.  ""The Searcher"" has a dramatic

    Eye"" is sturdier due to counterpoint, as a distorted lap steel guitar
    keens over Kelly's dirge-like strumming.  It's a distant wolf with a
    fire nearby, and it's shiver-inducing.</p><p>
    Von Till's folk is much more full-bodied due to diverse instrumentation.  On <em>A Grave Is a Grim Horse</em>,
    he girds his acoustic guitar with electric guitar, banjo, fiddle,
    cello, drums, and Hammond organ.  The result is a lucid, Nick Drake-esque setting subtly crowned with electricity.  Von Till also benefits from covering some masters: Drake, Townes Van Zandt, Lyle Lovett. 
    However, his songs more than stand on their own.  The alt-country
    lament of ""Looking for Dry Land"" could have come from Red House
    Painters.  Pedal steel guitar gently weeps in the twangy ""Western
    Son"".  ""Brigit's Cross"" alternates crackling electric chords with
    plaintive fiddle lines.  A quavering organ illuminates ""The Acre"",
    which instructs, ""You must work with the acre you are given.""  Von Till's not just speaking in metaphor.  He moved from the Bay Area to a rural life in Idaho;  <em>A Grave</em> is the happy result of a metaller being literally put out to pasture.

But in the six years that have elapsed since the German band's 2002 Stateside breakthrough <em>Neon Golden</em>, the Notwist haven't changed so much as the definition of what it means to be an indie/electronic crossover act.</p><p>
    For the Notwist, the gradual adoption of IDM idioms was less a paradigm shift than a complementary outcome, with the clicks and cuts that permeated <em>Neon Golden</em> and its 1998 predecessor <em>Shrink</em> providing a more modern variation of the tape hiss and crackle that formed the intimate ambience to the classic 80s indie-rock records on which brothers Markus and Micha Acher were raised. But since <em>Neon Golden</em>'s release, the indie/electronic divide that the Notwist so carefully toed has been obliterated in a flash of strobe lights, with acts like Cut Copy and Hot Chip pushing shy-guy indie-poptronica out of the bedroom and onto discotheque floors; compared to the outsized, big-room ballast of ""Lights and Music"" and ""Over and Over"", the Notwist's brand of mechanized melancholy now seems understated.</p><p>
    Of course, the obvious move would be for resident programmer Martin Gretschmann to beef up the beats and set the synths on squelch<em></em>. But for all of their rhythmic manipulations and percussive precision, the Notwist have always strived to move the heart over the hips. And if anything, their knee-jerk response to indie's current clubland crossover is to head back to the garage: <em>The Devil, You + Me</em>'s stellar opening salvo, ""Good Lies"", begins with a bright, jangly guitar riff and a pounding floor-tom beat that mainline Sonic Youth's <em>Daydream Nation</em>, while frontman Markus Acher introduces the anthemic, gently fist-pumped chorus. But the song's euphoric rush-- emphasized by its breakdown/rebuild structure-- is decidedly at odds with the betrayals described within. Acher provides a candid glimpse into a troubled marriage by describing it in terms of the material goods used to prop it up-- ""I remember good lies/ When we carried them home with us/ To our bedside tables and the coffee sets""-- thereby keenly drawing parallels between dysfunctional relationships and the IKEA-furnished apartments that house them: the cool surface appearances barely concealing the soul-deadening sterility. The equally affecting ""Gloomy Planets"" works a similar contrast between expression and repression-- overtop spirited folk-song strums, Acher asks ""why is everything so locked up?"" before the song's ascending, accelerated climax lets it all out in a cathartic gush of tremoled synth tones and motorik motion.</p><p>
    Appearing in the first and third positions respectively, ""Good Lies"" and ""Gloomy Planets"" make an early case for <em>The Devil, You + Me</em> as the Notwist's return-to-rock gesture, and the fact that the title track-- a glockenspiel-glistened  acoustic lullaby-- is based upon a chorus melody very similar to that of <em>Neon Golden</em>'s ""Pick Up the Phone"" might suggest the Notwist are settling into a comfort of zone of sorts. Though they comprise <em>The Devil, You + Me</em>'s most immediate moments, these songs aren't the most representative ones on an album that proves to be every bit as intricate in construction and disorienting in effect as its celebrated predecessors. Melody is an absolute, but everything else is fair play: on the unnerving ""Alphabet"", a tense one-chord acoustic strum clears the way for a procession of horror-movie drones, power-drill guitar squall, laser-beam synths clattering drum breaks and incessant sleigh bells-- recalling the soundtracky beat-scapes the Notwist fashioned in 2006's <em>13 &amp; God</em> collaboration with hip-hoppers Themselves-- all while Acher drops one-liners like ""I won't sing you algebra"" with an eerie sense of calm. Later, on side two, the bedside ballad ""Sleep"" projects a break-of-dawn optimism that's mischievously undercut by piercing glitches and booming dub breaks, the latter of which also form the backbone for the shadowy slow-motion creep of ""On Planet Off"". But even as the <em>mise en scène</em> around him mutates in unexpected, sometimes sinister ways, Acher's voice is unwaveringly poised, an eminently curious instrument that manages to project both disaffection and great concern in the same breath.</p><p>
    In contrast to its briskly paced first act, <em>The Devil, You + Me</em> doesn't so much build to a finale as gradually wind itself down, lending the album a sense of anti-climax; in retrospect, it would have been a smart idea to reassign ""Gloomy Planets"" to the home stretch so as to break up the second side's mid-tempo momentum. But even after a six-year siesta, the Notwist's approach to pop music-- exploiting both its formal properties and endless possibilities-- is no less captivating and visionary than before. And when Acher declares himself ""Gone, Gone, Gone"" on the album's sweet, uncannily Nico-esque closing ballad, you're left hoping you won't have to wait another half decade for a reintroduction.</p></div>"|11917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11917-the-devil-you-me/|7.7|Stuart Berman

    Auburn Lull have proven surprisingly hard to forget. Minor members of Michigan's minor space rock scene-- think Burnt Hair Records, Windy and Carl, Mahogany; call it suburbgaze-- the Lansing quartet are now on their fourth Darla release: a reissued 1999 debut, a rarities comp, and two proper full-lengths. And like the copy of <em>Alone I Admire</em> I copped so many years ago in one of those same Michigan suburbs, <em>Begin Civil Twilight</em> reminds of a time when I very nearly bought a Landing record every time I entered a record store and when I actually did buy a used Flying Saucer Attack album every time I entered a record store. Auburn Lull sell a particularly dense, nurtured form of dream-pop that acts as an admirably neutral standard for a genre and scene whose survival instincts have proven cockroach-like.</p><p>
    Auburn Lull sport a perfectly shoegaze-y name-- well, perfectly American anyway, as those E'd-up cross-pond Brits wouldn't be caught dead in something so drearily Midwestern-- but even that genre would imply too much grit: <em>Begin Civil Twilight</em> takes far more cues from ambient or even new age music. Guitarist/vocalist Sean Heenan captains the band with a sadistically slow metronome; drummer Jason Wiesinger possesses either otherworldly patience or mountains of sedatives. Along with guitarists/bassists Jason Kolb and Eli Wekenman they resist any and all temptation to create friction or to amass tension. Apply all standard music-critic buzzwords to the guitars: float, drift, languish, glide. Drum patterns are whisked away like accumulated rain from a windshield.</p><p>
    Compared to their peers, Auburn Lull are relatively less willing to blur their sounds-- guitars and keyboards mostly meld, but there are traceable lines drawn between the vocals, bass, and drums. The difference seems to arise less out of a desire to produce proper pop music than to not let Heenan's understated delivery and actual melodies go to waste. Opener ""Light Through the Canopy"" peels away to reveal a heavily reverberated Heenan worming his way through a contoured melody: ""This is how it's supposed to go,"" he claims, light/lite guitars wearing threadbare behind him in confirmation. ""Broken Heroes"", <em>Twilight</em>'s most overt pop stab, relies on little more than intermittent bass gurgles during the verse, allowing Heenan and wife Elsa room to mourn in unison. ""November's Long Shadows"" (stereotypical song title alert level: Orange) features a curlicue lead guitar that cuts through the ever-present sheen and gives the song a vague college-rock feel. ""Coasts"", ironically, is the closest <em>Twilight</em> comes to propulsion, dancing with a skittish high-hat before stumbling into a jog, little guitar bends and stabs darting in and out of a tastefully martial drum pattern.

    While the band's lack of saturation has heretofore worked to its advantage, with each successive release Auburn Lull sound less like squirreled-away torch-guarders and more like a veteran group of studio wizards retracing their steps very, very, very slowly. <em>Twilight</em> contains plenty of Auburn Lull autopilot: little tone poems with vague clips of dialogue (""Geneva""), four and five minute swaths of effected guitar (""Civil Twilight""), or blank soundscapes that serve only as cots for pretty acoustic noodling (""Stanfield Echo"" and, most egregiously, the untitled nine-minute closer). These are not offensive compositions, just extraneous ones that seem like dead weight for a band three albums in and capable of lovingly muted pop. Auburn Lull remain charmingly unswayed by time; hearts grow fonder, sure, but metal rusts and shelves dust over, too.<br/>

Plus some barely serviceable party tunes. And, oh yeah, they're kinda sexy, too. Actually, it's tough to tell exactly which readymade, tongue-in-cheek pop angle they're adopting, but the duo's genesis unequivocally stems from a mutual jadedness towards the record industry. Both Katie White and Jules De Martino cut their teeth in teenage pop groups only to see their music career as adults hamstrung by bum record deals and one false start after another. Bent on seeking vengeance, the pair packs loads of not-so-subtle jabs at the industry into their spotlight-hungry debut, but despite the tough talk, they can't avoid sounding like the simplistic saccharine pop lifers they are.</p><p>
    Of course, no one expects an album like <em>We Started Nothing</em> to carry the torch for subversive, incendiary popular song (see Robyn, Santogold, and M.I.A., among others, for that); we just demand good hooks and lots of 'em. Any hand-wringing over the Ting Tings's conceit as Top 40 mutineers is rendered moot by the inadequacy of their pop craftsmanship. Shticks may make for easy initial criticism, especially with great pop acts already straddling the lines between the charts and indie (cf. Lily Allen, the Pipettes, Annie), but when a band sport featherweight singles like ""Shut Up and Let Me Go"" and ""That's Not My Name"", they'd be lucky if listeners pay attention long enough to even notice their bit.</p><p>
    The duo self-produced <em>Nothing </em>and, thanks to their hefty experience, they accurately cop pretty much any genre they want, from fratty new wave to mopey twee-pop. Problem is, they pay little attention to detail. On a breezy summer jam like single ""Great DJ"", this can pass as shrewd understatement, but other tracks don't benefit from the same. ""Fruit Machine"" is a grinding bitchslap that never really connects, wanting so badly to sound just a smidgen as tough as Peaches or M.I.A. but inevitably melting into painfully adorable, boring Toni Basil cadences. When the time comes to really crank up the party engine, White and De Martino prove even more shorthanded. After club-footed dance numbers ""We Walk"" and ""Shut Up and Let Me Go"" sink the album, the duo tries to bring it home with the six minute-plus self-titled closer, a seemingly endless, riff-less stab at B-52's bacchanalia that never gets off the ground.</p><p>
    Maybe it's my own vengeful sadism talking, but the Ting Tings sound much more engaging when sad. ""Be the One"" and ""Traffic Light"" may not possess the immediacy to qualify as standout tracks, but the goth-tinged twee of the former and aching lullaby of the latter makes for the most fully fleshed-out ideas amidst a sea of half-baked inklings here. Maybe once the Ting Tings stop trying so hard to convince everyone they're having a good time and start <em>actually </em>having a good time, these cute little ballads will no longer be their sole redeeming quality. For now, we're stuck listening to them flounder for revenge like they haven't learned a damn thing from Shakespeare or <em>The Wrath of Khan</em>.</p></div>"|11594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11594-we-started-nothing/|3.8|Adam Moerder

As first lines of an album go, this one, the opening shot fired on Silver Jews' 1998 album <em>American Water</em>, is among the greats, up there with <em>Raw Power</em>'s ""I'm a street-walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm"" and <em>Straight Outta Compton</em>'s ""You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge."" It's an especially great line coming from Silver Jews' David Berman because ""perfection"" as a concept has little place in his universe. In this landscape, flubbed notes exist alongside amazing guitar solos (when Berman's buddy Stephen Malkmus is around, anyway), shirts are untucked, keys are more suggestions than rules, some of the best lyrics in rock history are interspersed with unapologetic groaners (I could kiss the guy who wrote, ""Come to Tennessee/ 'Cause you're the only ten I see"") and characters are often flawed to the point of paralysis.</p><p>
    Perfection being what it is for Silver Jews, and Berman being so comfortable with that notion, it's easy for fans to gloss over the rough patches. I have a feeling I'm not alone when I say that on every SJ record-- save <em>American Water</em>, almost-- I still skip around a bit. The nature of Silver Jews allows for inconsistent albums, even though the records appear infrequently. Two or three or four duff tracks on one record is nothing to get worked up about, and they may even add to the ramshackle charm. And so while <em>Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea</em>, the first Silver Jews album in almost three years, has the usual small handful of eh-to-just-OK tracks, it also feels different from prior Silver Jews albums in a way that's hard to put a finger on.</p><p>
    Part of it could be the lack of knockout songs. There are no instant entries to the SJ canon, nothing here that knocks you on your ass, not a single ""How did he write that?"" moment. And this problem is there from the beginning, the opening, where SJ have always killed: Where <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em> grabbed us by the throat with ""Punks in the Beerlight"" and <em>The Natural Bridge</em> turned a chair around and sat us down to explain ""How to Rent a Room"", <em>Lookout Mountain</em> opens with the plodding and dull ""What Is Not But Could Be If"". You feel like you just tripped and fell awkwardly into the album.
    </p><p>
    It doesn't help that the production is oddly harsh and distant-sounding; where Berman sounds best clear and uncluttered, so that it seems like he's engaging you in conversation, on this record his voice has a weirdly persistent metallic reverb clinging to it, like he's broadcasting from inside a tin can and you're straining to connect with him. Something about the sound makes him sound a bit uneasy, stiff, and a touch less confident. Busy Nashville producer Mark Nevers handled a chunk of the recording and all the mixing, and the warmth he's been known to give albums by Lambchop, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, and the Clientele is missing here. Berman's bassist and vocalist wife Cassie is, as she was on <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em>, far too high in the mix. There were some weird choices made in the studio.
    </p>
<p>
    I shouldn't dwell on the production, since this band started out as the lo-ist of the lo-fi, recording white noise-packed songs on answering machines-- and besides, you listen to Silver Jews for words. But an album that finds Berman in a more focused mode lyrically, writing lines that seem to straighten out some of his bent lyrical aesthetic, would do well to come with a more welcoming sound. In any event, there are still good songs with quotable lines here, thankfully, and the tunes throughout are solid. The lengthy, bouncy, Dylan-y ""San Francisco B.C."", in particular, is packed with lyrical nuggets: ""We had sarcastic hair/ We used lude (sic) pseudonyms/ We got a lot of stares on the street back then"" and ""She said, 'You don't make enough to provide for me'/ I said, 'What about the stuff that we-- quote-- believe?'"" are two. (I love how you can picture the fingers in the air setting aside the word ""believe."") 
    </p>
<p>
    If the focus throughout seems to move away from stringing together rich, penetrating images, Berman is still skilled enough with words to make him do what he wants them to. The peppy, rushed ""Aloysius, Bluegrass Drummer"" is a surreal short story, with a title character who is a dishwasher at a restaurant ""Open 'til the end of time"" and who falls for a girl ""all strung-out on hard street fat."" And then the weary countrified lament ""Strange Victory, Strange Defeat""-- which wonders about the ""handsome grandsons in these rockband magazines"" who have supplanted ""the fat ones, the bald and the goateed""-- works pretty well, even if the second half of the song doesn't stick. The closing track, ""We Could Be Looking for the Same Thing""-- a cozy ballad that finds David duetting with Cassie-- strips the lyrical flourishes back almost completely: Lines like ""Where the days turn the weeks into months of the year"" and ""I've been around some and I've seen enough to know/ We could spend happy lives, inside the days of you and me"" could have been written by any number of singer-songwriters. That seems purposeful: Berman seems to have something specific that he wants to get across, and he's OK saying it in what, for him, is a direct way.
    </p>
<p>
    With both <em>Lookout Mountain</em> and <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em>, there's been discussion about these records being made after Berman's time staring into the abyss, when he survived a suicide attempt, worked through a serious drug problem, got married, started touring, and generally got his shit together. So it's tempting to hear some of the differences with this record-- the tamer imagery, the more even keel, the highs that aren't so high-- as somehow mirroring the changes in Berman's personal life. For me, though-- since I never knew how tough Berman had it while enjoying his records up through <em>Bright Flight</em>, never had a clue as to depths of his suffering, and never heard his music in that context-- it seems wrong to start thinking about such things now. Instead, I prefer to think of <em>Lookout Mountain</em> as an album of pretty-good songs from a guy who has written some unbelievably great ones, and will, more than likely, write some more of that quality down the road. There's never been any kind of definable arc with the Silver Jews, no movement toward a fixed point; it's more about keepin' on keepin' on. Once perfection is off the table, and you're just doing the best you can with what you have, there will be moments like this.

But listening to the English guitarist's new album, it's clear it's not that simple. While echoes of those three and some of their contemporaries are still present in Blackshaw's music, these days you can hear just as much Terry Riley and Philip Glass in his work. His synthesis of acoustic experimentalism and minimalism is so complete at this point that it's possible to call it Blackshaw's own style.</p><p>
    His evolution as an instrumentalist hasn't so much been one of technique (he arrived quite fully formed in that department) as one of diversification. Blackshaw continually expands his approach, and on <em>Litany of Echoes</em>, his sixth album, he's extended his reach away from the 12-string acoustic guitar to the piano, building the record's bookends, ""Gate of Ivory"" and ""Gate of Horn"", off of thick, relentlessly repetitive piano figures. His approach to the piano, though uncomplicated in terms of musicianship, shares much in common with his approach to the guitar. On the latter, he often uses open tunings that allow him to leave notes ringing while he plays short figures or to take advantage of sympathetic vibrations that add clouds of overtones to his music. On the piano, it's a little more straightforward: Blackshaw puts the sustain pedal to the metal and turns simple chords into sheets of harmony. This produces the same kind of sympathetic overtones, but in a great many more octaves.</p><p>
    It's still his guitar playing, however, that thrills the most. On ""Echo And Abyss"", Blackshaw alternates dense passages of fluttering, thick guitar and piano chords with sparse solo acoustic guitar passages. In these instances, he plays simple melodic figures over and over, subtly mutating them. The notes he leaves ringing, particularly when he plays harmonics, create sound for the listener that isn't actually even there-- the beating of two close notes against each other creates the auditory illusion of oscillation, adding a false dimension to the sound that nonetheless enriches it.
    </p><p>
    Blackshaw employs violinist/violist Fran Bury to deepen the texture of some of his extended compositions, but ""Infinite Circle"", the smoothest, most harmonically placid song here (it's sort of New Age-y at times) is the only one where it sounds much like a violin or viola normally does. ""Past Has Not Passed"", the album's most stunning composition, features the strings scraping away at the back of the guitar. Bury sets up a pool of drone for Blackshaw to drop strange, sweeping chords into before settling on a pedal tone and working out the song's primary theme, which he reiterates countless times, carefully controlling his constant dynamic fluctuations.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Litany of Echoes</em> gives me the impression that Blackshaw began to feel so thoroughly in control of his craft on last year's brilliant <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em> LP that he needed some new element to destabilize it. The piano doesn't so much do that as logically extend what he already does with 12 strings into a much larger resonating box. Partly because of broader palette, this album loses some of the magnificence of its predecessor, but it is still a heaping pile of gorgeousness that adds another chapter to a young guitarist's already very impressive and increasingly indefinable oeuvre.

They disbanded in the mid-1980s, just as more and more people were growing aware that there was music being released all over the world, some of it-– gasp!-– not even in English. Still, the Senegalese group had it better than most. During their initial run, at least, Orchestra Baobab ruled West African pop, and their impact and influence were such the group eventually reconvened, at last getting the star treatment not just locally but around the globe.</p><p>
    Orchestra Baobab's aptly titled 2002 comeback disc, <em>Specialist in All Styles</em>, encapsulated many of the ever-evolving group's strengths, in particular their knack for musical assimilation. Equally informed by Cuban and indigenous African musics, not to mention hybrids like Congolese rumba and Senegal's own pop strain mbalax, the disc found them picking up where they left off. Six years later, <em>Made in Dakar</em> continues the voyage with still more seamless style blending. Of course, nothing here is as crass as, say, rap-metal. Orchestra Baobab's fusion is far more subtle, and always rooted in traditional music. While world music elitists might prefer their sounds obscure, exotic, and mysterious, Orchestra Baobab is so smooth, so deceptively accessible, that for once the liner notes actually significantly enhance the listening experience.</p><p>
    We learn that the lead track, ""Pape Ndiaye"", stretches back to 1968, and marked one of the first modern updatings of a traditional griot song. We see that ""Nijaay"" was first performed by Baobab back in 1972; the version here features a cameo from Youssou N'Dour, whose own stardom eventually came to eclipse Baobab. ""Beni Baraale"" is a tribute to Guinea's equally groundbreaking Bembeya Jazz; Guinea guitarist Baba Nabe joins Baobab guitarist Barthélemy Attisso in what amounts to a tip of the hat by way of ethno-musicology.
    </p><p>
    Each song here-- with vocals performed in Wolof, Portuguese Creole, French, and Malinke-- is equally rich in history, testament to one of the few positive outcomes of European occupation as they deftly incorporate soul and salsa, rumba and jazz, reggae and country, an exercise in cross-pollination made all the more impressive by the near invisibility of the threads connecting it all. That's ultimately what makes Orchestra Baobab such a joy: It's dance music, pure and simple, made for others to have a good time, easily appreciated on the basis of its musicianship alone (Attisso is particularly inspired throughout) but becoming more impressive the deeper you dig into what's actually being done.

    Ignore that score, kind of! You are reading a rave, the only tire-slashing stipulation being that this duo can only achieve so much subglory, even at their finest! I actually <em>like</em> the great cynical joke that the Presets went to conservatory but anti-compositionally named their band after authorless automation. Seriously, hating on the Presets is like hating on Cheetos. You know damn well what you're getting, that the product leaves fingerstains, and that it is not ""good,"" but can still be a tad awesome, occasionally. Having a Presets jam stuck in your head, though, is akin to holding a crinkly orange bag of that aforementioned snack up to your maw for a slide-gorge and getting a single errant Cheeto lodged somewhere in your overalls, or ski suit, or tight Modular tee, or whatever: It's sort of annoying but also sort of Aryan-trash James Bond to keep it hidden somewhere in your getup, undetectable via naked eyes.</p><p>
    Debut full-length <em>Beams</em> committed the casual sin of many an electro-pop album-- it contained four hits and a bunch of filler tracks only distinguishable from fellow whoom-whoom-whoomers such as, say, Boys Noize by a giddy Reagan-era gloss. The singles-- and their remixes-- created enough goodwill, though, that one didn't wholly disdain the Presets for surrounding the hits with all that parsley-house. (I'd go as far as to say that each iteration of ""Down Down Down"" is a calf-cramping, forelock-swinging, sweat-drinking <em>banger</em>.) This sophomore release, despite its titular breach of the moratorium on dreary, been-done apocalypse puns, is laudable for pretty much sustaining every cut's levels of quality, such as they are.</p><p>
    Once again, vocalizer Julian Hamilton plays impressionist. Mostly gone now, though, are his ribald takes on PiL's John Lydon, Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, and Matthew Dear. <em>Apocalypso</em> features blasé (and certainly intentional?) apings of the Faint's Todd Baechle/Fink, the B-52s' Fred Schneider, and Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder. The effect is: sass aplenty, as each song's verses are sneered with macho Billy Idol bombast, only to go high/falsetto on the chorus, and then refrain like the Cult's Ian Astbury moonlighting as a motivational speaker for real estate agents. Kim Moyes' programmed keys are hardly solely responsible for <em>Apocalypso</em>'s being so much aural potpourri atop the toilets of dance clubs hosting 80s nights: You get dabs of swooning Moz, booty-rap-caliber lyrics about girls hungry for ""T-bone,"" triumphant elemental clichés straight outta Bon Jovi, and even hair metal's preoccupation with sterile priapic imagery and prowlerism (check the metal masks and crystal boners making up the artwork of this disc and recent singles). Even their embrace of being labeled ""gaybe"" seems to quaintly hearken back to my childhood of watching painted dudes with teased hair and lacy outfits all bothered on MTV. 
    </p>
<p>
    Hamilton and Moyes' mutual derivativity eventually suggests hybrids of hybrids, like Klaxon Killers meets Duran Justice. Everything here goofily struts and snarkily pulses, and its crassness is the only tonal ""advance"" on display since, well, the proliferation of electroclash compilations at the dawn of this decade. ""My People"" and ""Talk Like That"" are the most punishing (in a good way) numbers, while the boring ""Together"" is apparently a study of how bpms affect sleep rhythms. ""Eucalyptus"" is the oddest effort, as it careens from threatening vamp to Erasure smooshiness-- interesting but ultimately abortive. 
    </p>
<p>
    So this album is a seminar on how to score exactly par in this genre: Simplistic overdriven synth riffs, drained drum-machinery, a rockist 'tude, intense vacillations from ""flowing"" to ""jilted,"" blurry buildups to stark breakdowns, choruses unmeant to penetrate conscious consciousness, sirens, laser sounds, consistent privileging of urbanity, etc. (""This Boy's In Love"" is particularly rich, in that the romance doesn't get belted about as passionately as its context: ""Under the city lights!"") That even the ""human"" ""analog"" vox are constantly looped and stretched doesn't help give <em>Apocalypso</em> the antiseptic, Kubrickian-soundstage feel attained by the best digitalia. The fun herein notwithstanding, as you listen, try to not to place an eBay bid on a Fantom Fogger, think about how unvogue it was when Trans Am re-did this stuff before everybody else (and got called Loverboy loyalists), and tag these tunes in your playlists as (At Least It's) Not the Bravery, or maybe just Huuuge In Sydney.

    Regardless of their still-burgeoning profile and local-hero charm, the supreme confidence of the M's has been apparent from the very beginning. From their first eponymous EP onwards, they've written simple, soaring melodies and cobbled together anthemic rock from the glam of Bowie and T. Rex, the saccharine tunes of the Kinks and later Britpop, and the alternately scrappy and surging guitars of 90s American indie. It's the band's knack for making all that seem natural and effortless that's made them worth revisiting with each release, but on their third record that confidence has manifested itself in a different way: rather than barnstorming, the M's on <em>Real Close Ones</em> are starting to sound aloof. They subtract elements once integral to their sound, add a few no one saw coming, and pay unhurried homage to artists they've never nodded to before. If previous records had them pulling all the cool records out for new guests, <em>Real Close Ones</em> is what you'd hear on your ninth or tenth visit to the M's' apartment. Congratulations; you're bros now.</p><p>
    Part of that aforementioned confidence surely stems from the members' time spent in earlier bands. Three-fourths of the M's originally started in psych-pop outfit Sanoponic, and those roots are beginning to make themselves heard in these 13 songs. So while ""Big Sound"" starts things off with the weaving urgency you'd expect from the M's, its fuzzy production and seemingly anemic low-end sounds at first like something is missing-- like a car coming down the street without a windshield. ""Breakfast Score"" restores the ample low-end, but they soon add violin presets that would normally only fly in the haze of modern psych-pop. It reads like it should be at odds with the band's guitar-driven rock, and it's jarring at first, but it's incorporated with the same deliciously disinterested manner as any other part of their pastiche.</p><p>
    The guitar tone in ""Pigs Fly"" has gone for days without water, but the echo on the vocals serves the yearning harmonies perfectly, and some spacey Rhodes floating over it makes for the dreamy, sun-bleached highlight of the disc. ""Don't Be Late"" is tentative acoustic pop that phases in and out, as if being heard across the street through mid-day traffic, and ""Papers"" gets smokier with gurgling bass tones, lazy drum machine beats, and backwards guitar-- all sewn together into coy, crooning pop. The guitar intro for ""Get Your Shit Together"" is jagged indie with serious soul, but it's merely a segue into another woozy glam rock we've come to expect from the band, with some extra honking bass and a bit of Harry Nilsson's cracked swagger. Speaking of: ""Naked"" could be a dead ringer for ""Coconut"", a self-admittedly creepy ditty about where and why nudity can happen that never raises its voice above a drunken slur.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Ultraviolent Men"" begins as careless drum-machine pop, but the chorus once again shows the band's knack for melodies that blossom from nowhere in moments of subtle surprise. ""Impossible View"" is a swinging rocker toting a formidable low-end, though it may get its strength simply by standing next to the album's many diversions, not to mention the impossibly annoying chorus of ""Bros in Arms"". After that, tracks like the largely acoustic ""Tryin To Keep"" or the tireless Beatles worship of ""Days in the Sun"" end the record on an extended and lethargic denouement. Following their first two crunching and careening albums, it may seem as if the M's have lowered the bar for themselves, but through all the detours they've made an album that sounds more like themselves than any previous work. There's more personality here than pastiche, and that bodes extremely well.<br/>

Wolf Parade doesn't seem like a band that routinely logs its eight hours: <em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em>, the group's 2005 debut, was riddled with allusions to sleeplessness, and its follow-up, <em>At Mount Zoomer</em>, is no less restless-- it's a fraught, expansive ode to being way too awake. ""We're tired,"" vocalist/guitarist Dan Boeckner admits, voice defeated. ""We can't sleep.""</p><p>
    While prepping <em>At Mount Zoomer</em> for release, the band reportedly promised Sub Pop ""no singles,"" which-- no matter how attached you are to the notion of the LP as a singular document-- seems like a self-defeating vow. Paradoxically, for a statement of cohesion (take these tracks together, or don't take them at all), <em>At Mount Zoomer</em> is inherently disjointed, very much the product of two distinct, if exceptional, songwriters. Unluckily for Wolf Parade, the success of Boeckner and co-frontman Spencer Krug's side ventures (Handsome Furs and Sunset Rubdown, respectively) means their stylistic tics are now public information, and, as effectively as these dudes co-exist onstage, they're still singular creative forces.</p><p>
    The band's resolve to enlarge and intensify itself-- <em>At Mount Zoomer</em> seems focused on skewing darker, on sounding nastier, more perilous, and less straightforward than its predecessor, with elaborate arrangements and, you know, no singles-- translates into a lot of proggy diddling (and, ironically, less theremin). The approach yields predictably mottled results: <em>At Mount Zoomer</em> is both captivating (""Call It a Ritual"", ""Language City"", ""California Dreamer"") and a little bit exhausting. </p><p>
    Recorded in Petite Église, the Quebec church owned by Arcade Fire, and produced by drummer Arlen Thompson, <em>At Mount Zoomer</em> is free from the influence of Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock, who produced the bulk of <em>Apologies</em>. Lyrically, familiar themes abound: multiple allusions to funerals, cities, dreams, empty rooms, and things that mean nothing. Wolf Parade are uniquely skilled at skewering contemporary (see also: urban, digital, accelerated) culture, and these songs relay a sense of being stuck in the wrong spot at the wrong time-- it's a tense, tenuous place to live.  </p><p>
    ""Soldier's Grin"" opens with punchy keyboard and guitar, before Boeckner steps up to outline the scene: ""In my head, there's a city at night,"" he sings, voice clear and desperate. Although the song's objectively optimistic, full of twittering synths and mewling guitars, it's also deeply anxious, and when Boeckner promises ""what you know can only mean one thing"" it seems pretty evident that that one thing's no good. ""Call It a Ritual"" is equally uneasy; Krug's quiet, opaque vocals are spectral and strange-- less piercing than Boeckner's, but way more atmospheric-- and the track descends into a dreamy, muddled haze that feels a little bit like sleepwalking. ""California Dreamer"", another Krug-penned cut, is epic in scope: Although it's only six minutes long, it's relentlessly squirmy, flitting from quiet, guitar-driven dirge to full-band throwdown.  </p><p>
    Whereas <em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em> closed with an unimpeachable tract of songs, from ""Shine a Light"" on, <em>At Mount Zoomer</em> fizzles and sags after its sixth track-- the record's grueling backend culminates with the contentious, 11-minute ""Kissing the Beehive"", a stubbornly unmelodic finale marked by a mush of throbbing guitars and histrionic vocals (ironically, it's the only track that Krug and Boeckner co-wrote). <em>At Mount Zoomer</em> is fractured and spastic, and at times, the band's ambition eclipses its strengths. Still, there's something about Wolf Parade's fragility that's profoundly relatable, and the sense that the entire operation could fall apart at any second-- that we're all tottering on the brink of total dissolution-- is as thrilling as it terrifying.</p></div>"|11616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11616-at-mount-zoomer/|7.7|Amanda Petrusich

A few years later, while in Germany Khan formed ""psychedelic soul big band"" the Sensational Shrines. By 2004, King Khan and the Shrines had played shows across Europe, along the way releasing not just a handful of 7"" and 10"" records, but also two full-length albums: 2001's <em>Three Hairs &amp; You're Mine</em>, which was produced by White Stripes engineer Liam Watson, and 2004's <em>Mr. Supernatural</em>.</p><p>
    Most people didn't hear about King Khan and the Shrines until last year, when <em>What Is?!</em>, their most recent LP for German label Hazelwood, seared the band's combustible combo-- Stax plus <em>Nuggets</em> plus hiss-covered indie-rock screwiness-- onto listeners' collective noggins. It was as if they were the Dirtbombs on simultaneous James Brown and Sun Ra kicks, or Black Lips with less of the Vice-ready comedy and more underlying pathos. Now signed to Vice, King Khan and the Shrines present a few of the best tracks from <em>What Is?!</em>, along with some of their earlier cuts, on label debut <em>The Supreme Genius of King Khan and the Shrines</em>. Despite the appropriately over-the-top title, it's not so much a <em>Greatest Hits-- </em><em>What Is?!</em> has slightly better songs overall-- as a chronicle of how Khan became King.</p><p>
    The strongest tracks, where the band's unhinged nostalgia meets not only squealing discord but also Khan's stupefying jester/soul-man antics, appeared previously on <em>What Is?!</em>. Take nourishment from the Hammond-drenched soul food-stamps of ""Welfare Bread"". Hear Khan go howling mad and a step past girl-crazy amid the sitar-like guitar and wah-wah pedals of ""I Wanna Be a Girl"". The string-tying absurdity of ""69 Faces of Love"", or the prickly dick jokes and ""Venus in Furs"" string drone of ""The Ballad of Lady Godiva"" are sadly absent, but the deafness-repping James Brown of ""Land of the Freak"", the Stooge-ian assault of ""No Regrets"", and the relatively sane red-line retro of ""Outta Harm's Way"" are all present and accounted for, as they should be.
    </p><p>
    The seeds for that sound were sown long ago, as the older tracks on <em>The Supreme Genius of</em> show. The record opens where it oughta-- at a record store-- with the masochistic ""Torture"", originally from a 2000 7"". The ""she's fat, she's ugly"" chorus of 2001 10"" cut ""Took My Lady to Dinner"" loses its novelty sooner than some of the band's later ideas, and yet every time Khan sings about bringing home the bacon (or his special lady's Empire State-sized ass), well I just break down and laugh; queasy ballad ""Fool Like Me"", from the 2001 debut LP, finds similar redemption. ""Sweet Tooth"", off a 2004 split LP with the Dirtbombs, has the party ambiance of <em>What's Going On</em>, but it, like a few of the tracks on the second half of the album, shows a group not quite fully formed, lacking the self-awareness and depth of their best work. ""My heart is broke and I feel alone,"" Khan intones on 2003's ""Que Lindo Sueno"". Even at their worst, they're merely retro. 
    </p>
<p>
    It probably bodes well for King Khan and the Shrines that their best days aren't already, uh, years behind them. If you're a newcomer to their cracked vintage universe, <em>The Supreme Genius of</em> should be an excellent introduction, the band as they currently want the world to see them. If you arrived with <em>What Is?!</em>, this one might not get as many spins, but it'll still provide important context and a couple of tracks you probably hadn't heard. And if you've been listening to these guys since the Spaceshits...why the hell didn't you tell anyone?!

Interest in the music outside of the communities it was made in is at an all-time high, and there is a new crop of intrepid reissue labels willing to put in enormous amounts of time and energy to bring this music to a whole new set of waiting ears. These are not the fly-by-night exploito outfits of old-- Popular African Music, Sound Way, Analog Africa, the newly resurrected Strut, and Graeme Counsel's recent series of African music projects on Stern's/Syllart do it the right way, tracking down the original masters when available, finding the artists, and making sure they get paid.</p><p>
    Analog Africa's Samy Ben Redjeb already had loads of cred for the way he handled his two previous releases, which featured Zimbabwe's Hallelujah Chicken Run Band and Green Arrows, respectively. He traveled to Zimbabwe and spent time with the creators, digging deep into their stories and emerging with great-sounding, informative compilations that thoroughly introduced the listener to both the music and the musicians. <em>African Scream Contest</em> moves a few thousand miles northwest to Benin and Togo, two chimney-shaped former French colonies (Togo was a German colony until WWI) squeezed between West Africa's Anglophone giants, Ghana and Nigeria.</p><p>
    These are small countries, usually overshadowed by their neighbors in international affairs but nonetheless culturally and musically rich, and both have experienced the numbingly common ailments of former European colonies to varying degrees. Most of Francophone Africa fell heavily under the sway of Congolese rumba in the 1960s and 70s, or developed heavily Cubanized forms of their own-- Senegal, Guinea, and Mali in particular developed their own sounds parallel to rumba. Benin and Togo were certainly not exempt from rumba's charms, but they were also caught in the highlife crossfire between Ghana and Nigeria, and the funk and soul sounds imported in massive quantities to those countries in the 60s and 70s inevitably found their way across the borders.
    </p><p>
    There's even a case to be made that Afrobeat developed just as much in Cotonou, Benin, as it did in Lagos, Nigeria. Ignace de Souza &amp; His Melody Aces were pulling in rock elements as early as 1962, and there's plenty of funk in his work with the Black Santiagos-- if you can find a copy, Original Music's long out-of-print Ignace de Souza compilation, <em>the Great Unknowns, Vol. 1</em>, is wall-to-wall brilliant. Benin had an amazing surfeit of excellent bands by the early 70s, and Redjeb tracked down many members, a touch-and-go process he describes vividly in the liners, which function as both educational piece and travelogue. 
    </p>
<p>
    The kings of the Cotonou scene were Orchestre Poly-Rythmo (there are innumerable variations on their name; the most complete is Tout Puissant Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou Dahomey). Though Redjeb makes an admirable attempt to offer as much variety as possible, Poly-Rythmo still shows up three times, once on its own and twice as a backing band. The band recorded in all kinds of styles-- check Popular African Music's <em>Reminiscin' in Tempo</em> disc for their highlife sound, and Sound Way's <em>Kings of Benin Urban Groove</em> for their funk side-- but these three all feature a particularly wicked high-speed groove that they were the first to perfect. Their ""Gbeti Madjro"" is stunningly funky, with a few head-spinning passages where the band strips back to just guitar, bass and drums as if to say ""even at our most skeletal, we are twice as powerful as anyone else.""
    </p>
<p>
    The quality of the recordings is excellent, and the remastering brings out the depth in each one, but the character of the sound is about as raw funk gets. Togo's Roger Damawuzan (sometimes spelled Damahouzon) has all the screaming charisma of early-70s James Brown, and his ""Wait for Me"" balances his gruff vocal with a cool, mellow guitar riff and burbling bass. The horns and guitar sound utterly Memphis, but the cracking drums are all West Africa. His countrymen, Napo de Mi Amor et Ses Black Devil's, turn in a burning, organ-led Afrobeat tune that recalls the style of some of their Ghanaian colleagues.
    </p>
<p>
    Back in Benin, Orchestre Super Jheevs des Paillotes come closest to matching Poly-Rythmo's breakneck Afrofunk groove on the amazing ""Ye Nan Lon An"", which swivels around an Afrobeat backbeat with a breathtaking guitar part that earns pride of place ahead of the vocals in the mix and makes that upside-down engineering decision sound completely logical. It's counterintuitive moves like this that make African funk such a constant joy to discover, and there are plenty more on this disc. But beyond that, there's just a uniqueness to these musicians' take on funk and Afrobeat that's magnetic. Dig the garage rock organ flipping out over the funk beat of El Rego et Ses Commandos' ""Se Na Min"". Try not to dance to Picoby Band d'Abomey's outrageously raw and rhythmic ""Mi Ma Kpe Dji"". If you're into funky African music you won't be able to resist them.
    </p>
<p>
<em>African Scream Contest</em> easily joins the ranks of the most essential African funk compilations, partly by covering ground no one else has walked on, but mostly just for relentlessly kicking ass for over an hour. This is some of the best funk ever recorded anywhere, and it ranges from quick blasts of hyperspeed groove like Le Super Borgou de Parakou's ""Congolaise Benin Ye"" to the ruminative Fela-style Afrobeat of Vincent Ahehehinnou and Les Volcans' spicy Afro-Cuban workout. Whether you've been hunting down El Rego 45s on eBay for years or just heard and loved your first Fela reissue, this disc is emphatically for you.

    Are the manifold manifestations of twee the most fearsome
    boogieman facing rock music?  Did you
    frame that Sasha Frere-Jones article where he complained about indie not being
    black enough?  Ever consider buying a
    Decemberists concert ticket just for chance to get a clean shot at Colin
    Meloy?  You should probably just stop
    reading right now.  Odds are, this very
    site is reviewing four other records that you'll almost certainly like more
    than this one.</p><p id=""tav81"">
    Okay, are they gone yet? 
    Great.  Admittedly, the old-salt seafarer archetype
    may as well be the paleface dope boy at this point in terms of tired ubiquity, and
    <em>All We Could Do Was Sing </em>is built on the very things that tend to keep the rhythm bandits at bay:
    massed choruses, prop pieces, nautical terminology, female bandmembers.  The good news is that the band's official
    debut (following the 2007 collection <em>Wind
    And The Swell</em>) is still a solid art-pop album at its core, and importantly,
    more <em>American Gangster </em>than <em>The Crane Wife-- </em>i.e., though anchored by
    a central narrative and supported by enough real life experience to tell the
    tale, Port O'Brien weaves its way in and out of the story whenever it's convenient.  Which I suppose would make the heaving,
    power-chorded scene dismissal ""Pigeonhold"" Port O'Brien's ""Ignorant Shit""-- an
    album highlight of playful venom that couldn't have less to do with the actual
    concept, which wraps up with the scratchy Exxon barb ""Valdez"" (""There's no way they can repay the sea/ There's about two million ways you could repay me"").</p><p id=""tav86"">
    It's a lyrical deception that carries throughout,
    particularly on ""Fisherman's Son"", which, despite being something an
    autobiographical retelling of cannery work in Alaska,
    is actually more of a country mouse/city mouse examination of the
    universal
    burden of living up to or breaking free of familial expectations.
    Likewise, the slowly rising string drama of ""Stuck on a Boat"" could
    just as easily be an allegory transferable to titles like
    ""Stuck in a Cubicle"". 
    </p>
<p id=""tav87"">
    While those two in particular manage to retain a rickety,
    unkempt charm, Port O'Brien come perilously close to running aground on
    obvious influences.  ""Don't Take My
    Advice"", cop of Modest Mouse's ""Perfect Disguise"" and all, is one of the more
    lethargic odes to wandering eyes you'll ever hear, dragging ass too heavily to
    really chase it, and ""In Vino Veritas"" finds Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Otherside""
    ambling on a horse with no name.  Of
    course, if you want to paint these guys as another teetering collective gassed
    off Arcade Fire fumes, overlong interlude ""The Rooftop Song"" serves up a
    softball c&amp;w approximation of ""Wake Up"" for your convenience.    
    </p>
<p id=""tav88"">
    But Port O'Brien know how to win skeptics over, a good trait
    to have when you're touring with sonically similar bands like Rogue Wave. This album is bookended
    by the most propulsive tracks-- ""Close The Lid"" does a wide-eyed scamper through
    its deceptively roomy five-minutes, latching on to a ragged guitar hook amidst
    the torrent.  But if they don't appeal to you in the first four minutes, odds are they won't at all-- ""I Woke Up Today""
    is a mission statement and a summation, a sticky acoustic motif over relentless
    drums, the group singing in chorus the whole time, echoing the main theme of
    its title by rhyming it with  ""in a very simple
    way.""  Turns out Port O'Brien take to the
    sea for the same reasons many do-- either as an escape or a search for some sort
    of cosmic truth.

The group is clearly well-versed in minimalism, and they make thoughtful meditations using a wide range of instruments (the CD notes list more than 20, including harmonium, singing bowl, water, and birds). But their farther-out drones tend to drift into ruts, and their music is more engaging and unpredictable when they mix abstraction with melody.</p><p>
    The best example comes in the middle of <em>The Siren's Wave</em>, during two 10-minute tracks that hit the poles of Nalle's sound. ""Voi Ruusuni (O Rose)"" is an elongated tone-poem with some hypnotic elements, especially Hanna Tuulikki's Yoko Ono-like wail. But mostly the track wanders with no clear destination, its sonic range narrow and its energy level unchanging. By contrast, ""Secret of the Seven Sirens"" moves purposefully from idea to idea. The band still rambles loosely, unrestricted by set patterns, but a little structure makes them more focused. It also frees Tuulikki and partners Chris Hladowski and Aby Vulliamy to try sounds that ""Voi Ruusuni""'s monolithic drone can't accommodate.</p><p>
    The rest of <em>The Siren's Wave </em>divides along similar lines. The gentle ""Alice's Ladder"" and the ethereal ""Young Light"" both entice with small melodies, but the morose ""First Eden Sank to Grief"" (Nalle aren't exactly comedians) sags into monotony. There are exceptions: the drone of opener ""Nothing Gold Can Stay'' mesmerizes due to Tuulikki's responsive voice, which sounds more like a string instrument than human breath. Tuulikki, who wrote most of these songs, smartly makes her singing the album's spine. Evoking Joanna Newsom, Björk, and Finnish avant-folker Lau Nau, she can sometimes get a bit too mannered, but she is admirably unafraid of any vocal sound, as childlike or atonal as it may be.</p><p>
    Even when Nalle meanders, you can hear strands of many influences in their loose concoctions, from La Monte Young to Tower Recordings to White Magic. This bodes well for the group's future-- as they hone in on what parts of their sound work best, the various traditions their music is steeped in should provide the staying power that <em>The Siren's Wave</em> might ultimately lack.</p></div>"|11597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11597-the-sirens-wave/|6.6|Marc Masters

If his idea of the cinematic differs from the glacial landscapes of Sigur Rós, or the widescreen orchestration of Eluvium, blame it on Jean-Luc Godard. The lo-fi pop singer/songwriter's releases evoke an urban boulevard of yet-unbroken dreams, starting with 2005 debut 7"" ""This City Tonight"" and continuing through last year's piano-synth instrumental <em>Dreamland</em> soundtrack LP. Like Peter Pan or a left-coast Jonathan Richman, Jay takes us to his imagined worlds on the <em>Airwalker</em> EP, released late last year, and first proper full-length <em>A Place Where We Could Go</em>. Both are bathed in reverb the way film noir is in shadow.</p><p>
    The <em>Airwalker</em> EP, then, is a cryptic, compelling short. As with Jay's ""We Were There"" 7"", released about the same time, the EP tucks Jay's half-crooned, half-spoken vocals into a bed of interlocking guitars, rigid beats, and analogue synths, creating an air of mystery out of disconnected images. Where the 40-second intro is a dubbier variation on the title track, doing little more than establish Jay's predisposition toward intros, ""Airwalker"" itself finds Jay singing beneath his usual voice, his reflecting intonations sounding like Ian Curtis, though there's a knowing artiness in the chuckles emanating from the right side of the speakers. ""What's in the air when you're walking on air?/ Where can we go when the lights are low?"" Jay repeats. More about images than meanings, it's the opening shot that draws the audience in.</p><p>
    The rest of the EP presages <em>A Place Where We Could Go</em>'s stark lullabies more clearly, even as it fails to achieve the title track's magic. Piano features amid the Morrissey-esque wordless murmuring of finale ""Can We Disappear?"", with its lyrics about shadows, and on the bass-driven ""We Stay Here (In Our Secret World)"", in which a ""secret"" boy and ""secret"" girl ""talk of secret things"" while driving down the boulevard past street lamps. ""Lunar Camel"" has the EP's most intricate guitar riff as well as its most explicit reference to pre-rock music (""Fly me to the moon""). The reverb-swept tambourine and guitar jangle of 1980s indie's 60s nostalgia accompanies what could be set directions on ""Angels on the Balcony"", with its talk of afterglows, open doors, phantom cigarettes, silent cries, and ""the kids,"" always the kids.
    </p><p>
<em>A Place Where We Could Go</em>, produced with great understatement by K founder and former Beat Happening frontman Calvin Johnson, is Jay's feature film. At slightly less than 29 minutes, it's a slight one, reminiscent of an era before 78-minute CDs-- and on it, Jay fittingly ditches the synths, playing guitars and pianos while Chris Sutton (of Olympia, Wash., groups C.O.C.O. and the Johnson-led Dub Narcotic Sound System) adds loose, simple drumming that varies in intensity as the songs dictate. From a six-second opener with Jay sighing ""night, night"" to a bare, piano-driven finale asserting that ""Someone Cares"", Jay's debut plays out like a Buddy Holly- and yé-yé-informed soundtrack to a night of wistful dreams that eventually (sort of?) come true. If there are hints of Bowie in there, it might just be a mutual admiration for British actor, singer, and songwriter Anthony Newley (""Pure Imagination"", ""Goldfinger""). 
    </p>
<p>
    The simple arrangements, like Jay's spoken-sung vocals, recall the solo work of Jonathan Richman, who has also bridged the pre-rock era with a punk sensibility, the Stop &amp; Shop with the lesbian bar. Jay's songs are best when the images they're centered around have, like 50s icons James Dean or Marilyn Monroe, a certain dream-like hyper-reality: the youthful title character of the fuzzed-out ""Beautiful Rebel"", the mysterious figures of slow doo-wop waltz ""The Living Dolls"", or the narrator dreaming ""of a story to tell/ While you lay there in soft white sheets"" on ""Escape to Aspen"". The first full-length track, night-night-bidding ""Heavenly Creatures"", pictures a face
    with ""porcelain skin, ruby-red lips, dark blond hair, fairy tale look."" The slightly plodding, flamenco-flavored ""Till We Meet Again"" has its bike ride at midnight, and the title track borrows the lamppost from the <em>Airwalker</em> EP.
    </p>
<p>
    None of this is as overly precious as it might sound-- Jay emphasizes mood over cleverness-- but the drowsy pacing and sentimental leanings won't be for everybody. Jay's voice takes on a higher tone on ""While the City Sleeps"", over snapped fingers and one of the album's fleeting bass lines, as he compares a dream-walk with a lover to, what else, a movie. The shambling ""Hold Me in Your Arms Tonite"" remakes the bed into a place for making love-- ""true love,"" as obvious as it is necessary to the album's narrative arc (such as it is). On bonus track ""Oh, Bright Young Things"", Jay murmurs, ""The other day my dreams and life seemed like one/ In my dreams I know how to fly."" <em>A Place Where We Could Go</em> probably wouldn't make much of a film, but it's a mostly picturesque escape.

""What's in the air when you're walking on air?/ Where can we go when the lights are low?"" Jay repeats. More about images than meanings, it's the opening shot that draws the audience in.</p><p>
    The rest of the EP presages <em>A Place Where We Could Go</em>'s stark lullabies more clearly, even as it fails to achieve the title track's magic. Piano features amid the Morrissey-esque wordless murmuring of finale ""Can We Disappear?"", with its lyrics about shadows, and on the bass-driven ""We Stay Here (In Our Secret World)"", in which a ""secret"" boy and ""secret"" girl ""talk of secret things"" while driving down the boulevard past street lamps. ""Lunar Camel"" has the EP's most intricate guitar riff as well as its most explicit reference to pre-rock music (""Fly me to the moon""). The reverb-swept tambourine and guitar jangle of 1980s indie's 60s nostalgia accompanies what could be set directions on ""Angels on the Balcony"", with its talk of afterglows, open doors, phantom cigarettes, silent cries, and ""the kids,"" always the kids.
    </p><p>
<em>A Place Where We Could Go</em>, produced with great understatement by K founder and former Beat Happening frontman Calvin Johnson, is Jay's feature film. At slightly less than 29 minutes, it's a slight one, reminiscent of an era before 78-minute CDs-- and on it, Jay fittingly ditches the synths, playing guitars and pianos while Chris Sutton (of Olympia, Wash., groups C.O.C.O. and the Johnson-led Dub Narcotic Sound System) adds loose, simple drumming that varies in intensity as the songs dictate. From a six-second opener with Jay sighing ""night, night"" to a bare, piano-driven finale asserting that ""Someone Cares"", Jay's debut plays out like a Buddy Holly- and yé-yé-informed soundtrack to a night of wistful dreams that eventually (sort of?) come true. If there are hints of Bowie in there, it might just be a mutual admiration for British actor, singer, and songwriter Anthony Newley (""Pure Imagination"", ""Goldfinger""). 
    </p>
<p>
    The simple arrangements, like Jay's spoken-sung vocals, recall the solo work of Jonathan Richman, who has also bridged the pre-rock era with a punk sensibility, the Stop &amp; Shop with the lesbian bar. Jay's songs are best when the images they're centered around have, like 50s icons James Dean or Marilyn Monroe, a certain dream-like hyper-reality: the youthful title character of the fuzzed-out ""Beautiful Rebel"", the mysterious figures of slow doo-wop waltz ""The Living Dolls"", or the narrator dreaming ""of a story to tell/ While you lay there in soft white sheets"" on ""Escape to Aspen"". The first full-length track, night-night-bidding ""Heavenly Creatures"", pictures a face
    with ""porcelain skin, ruby-red lips, dark blond hair, fairy tale look."" The slightly plodding, flamenco-flavored ""Till We Meet Again"" has its bike ride at midnight, and the title track borrows the lamppost from the <em>Airwalker</em> EP.
    </p>
<p>
    None of this is as overly precious as it might sound-- Jay emphasizes mood over cleverness-- but the drowsy pacing and sentimental leanings won't be for everybody. Jay's voice takes on a higher tone on ""While the City Sleeps"", over snapped fingers and one of the album's fleeting bass lines, as he compares a dream-walk with a lover to, what else, a movie. The shambling ""Hold Me in Your Arms Tonite"" remakes the bed into a place for making love-- ""true love,"" as obvious as it is necessary to the album's narrative arc (such as it is). On bonus track ""Oh, Bright Young Things"", Jay murmurs, ""The other day my dreams and life seemed like one/ In my dreams I know how to fly."" <em>A Place Where We Could Go</em> probably wouldn't make much of a film, but it's a mostly picturesque escape.

    Earlier this year, Britons voted Coldplay as The Band Most Likely
    to Put You to Sleep. The poll, conducted by hotel chain Travelodge, had
    Chris Martin &amp; Co. beating out aural Ambien
    including James Blunt and Norah Jones. Even for a band known to take
    solace in their overarching pleasantness, the drowsy coronation doubled
    as a harsh insult. After all, Coldplay is a <em>rock</em> band. A
    grandma-friendly, Radiohead-normalizing, disarmingly polite rock band led by a man who sounds like
    he's still yearning for puberty perhaps...but a <em>rock</em> band nonetheless. After
    proving their stadium bona fides with 2002's bristling <em>A Rush of Blood
    to the Head</em>, these wuss messiahs fattened up with <em>X&amp;Y</em>, a
    startlingly bland affair that even forced eternally level-headed <em>New York
    Times</em> critic Jon Pareles to dub them ""the most insufferable band of the
    decade."" The Travelodge
    survey indicated this considerate foursome wasn't even keeping people
    awake long enough to piss them off anymore. So Coldplay did what any U2
    acolytes worth a chiming guitar chord would do-- they went off to
    ""rip it up and start again."" But
    <em>Viva</em> isn't a complete overhaul á la <em>Achtung Baby</em> or <em>Kid A</em>; just as they
    dull the sharp corners of their legendary influences musically,
    Coldplay
    offer a diluted version of the ""experimental"" mid-career maneuver with
    their fourth LP. It's a case of well-honed troubleshooting that should
    keep the faithful conscious enough to appreciate its subtle
    improvements.</p><p>
    Ever self-deprecating, Martin offered his band's thesis to MTV a couple weeks
    ago: ""We look at what other people are doing and
    try and steal all the good bits,"" he said. ""We steal
    from so
    many different places that hopefully it becomes untraceable."" That last
    bit is probably wishful thinking. For their ""new direction"" album, Coldplay hired the egghead responsible for more new direction albums than any other producer over the past 35 years, Brian Eno. The move isn't original, but it's smart. A
    self-described ""sculptor"" with a tendency to chip away rather than
    augment, Eno helps Coldplay reverse their bloat in favor
    of a slimmer sound; the anthems remain but they're no longer bogged
    down by incessant refrains and overdubs.</p><p>
    Thanks to a bubbling bit of exotic percussion that wouldn't sound out of place on Peter Gabriel's latter-day LPs, ""Lost!"" is transformed from Just Another Coldplay Song into a uniquely alluring smash and live staple for years to come.
    The Gabriel connection is also apparent on the spectacular, wide-eyed
    ""Strawberry Swing"", which floats light tribal drums above circular
    guitars and Martin's idyllic musings. Think ""In Your Eyes"": The Next
    Generation. More welcomed semi-surprises: Ballsy first single ""Violet
    Hill"" pulls off some honest-to-God <em>Scary Monsters</em> mutant funk while ""Chinese Sleep Chant"" is a shoegaze excursion as traceable as it is passable.  Arcade Fire producer Markus Dravs' touch can be heard on the  strung-out anthem ""Viva la Vida"", its ""woah oh oh!"" refrain already responsible for untold iPod
    sales. Apart from a few brief lulls into somnolent twinkle-pop, the
    music is purposeful, svelte, and modern. If only Martin could inject
    some pathos into his often-embarrassing universal scripture.</p><p>
    There's a thin line between lyrics that speak to everyone and lyrics that suck-up to everyone (see: Bono's steady devolution over the last couple decades). Even on Coldplay's best songs, Martin sometimes has trouble reconciling his inner hack with his better judgment. On <em>Viva</em>, he
    backs away from the wallowing self-pity that tanked <em>X&amp;Y</em>, instead
    going for black-and-white extremes-- life and death, love and lust, dreams and
    reality-- with little regard for any shades of gray. His supposedly ominous
    headstone obsession on ""Cemeteries of London"" is about as creepy as a
    midday graveyard stroll. And ""Lost!"" is nearly done in by a cringeworthy verse featuring big fish and a small pond. But there are moments
    when Martin's band mates push his wide-open words toward more specific meaning.
    Blissful nostalgia permeates ""Strawberry Swing"" so thoroughly it's
    impossible to deny its ""perfect day,"" and the hook to <em>Viva</em>'s closer
    relishes its immortal rush: ""I don’t want to follow death and all of his friends!"" He may be a pointed critic of his own broadness-- as seen in his guest appearance on ""Extras"" and
    in countless humble interviews-- but Martin is still a hopeless sap.
    He's clearly aware of Thom Yorke's apocalyptic verve and Bono's most cunning reflexive confessionals, but thus far he's incapable of matching either one. </p><p>
    ""Lights
    will guide you home/ And ignite your bones/ And I will try to fix you,""
    sang Martin on <em>X&amp;Y</em>'s ""Fix You"", a gag-inducing bit of motivational
    flotsam that came off like self-parody. <em>Viva</em> offers a more
    believable fix to the current Coldplay dilemma, i.e., how does a pop
    band with artful aspirations please everyone while satisfying
    themselves at the same time? Because while they ape their forebears
    without mercy, there's no mistaking a Coldplay song from a U2 or Radiohead
    song. The new album expands their individuality in tiny, effective ways
    while maintaining their world-beating gifts. The record's violent, revolution-themed artwork is misleading. <em>Viva</em> is more like a bloodless coup--
    shrewd and inconspicuous in its progressive impulses.

But now that record companies have lost control of the means of production, it's funny to see the indie-rock industry resorting to the same behaviour: Making people buy the same albums over and over again, lavishing the reissue treatment not just onto era-defining classics (e.g., Pavement's <i>Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe and Deluxe</i> set), but also on albums that were simply very good. Just this spring alone we're being treated to 15th-anniversary editions of Liz Phair's <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, the Lemonheads' <i>It's a Shame About Ray</i>, and Sebadoh's <i>Bubble and Scrape</i>-- albums that were certainly much admired and analyzed in their 1993 inception, but which in 2008, don't really resonate far beyond nostalgic completists.</p>
<p>By that yardstick, Scottish post-rock perennials Mogwai are jumping the gun somewhat, reissuing their debut full-length album, <i>Young Team</i>, in an expanded double-disc edition barely a decade after it first appeared, and given that they've released a steady stream of mildly variable albums since then, it's not as if we've had much of a chance to miss them. But in this particular case, the reissue serves more of a practical than a canonical function-- the label that released <i>Young Team</i> in the U.S. in 1997, Jetset, went kaput several years ago, making what is still the band's most cohesive and consistently bracing album the hardest to find on these shores. But the timing is all the more appropriate given that Mogwai's most recent release, 2006's <i>Mr. Beast</i>, was their most perfunctory set of quiet/LOUD instru-metal to date, so it's an opportune time to revisit the album that made us care in the first place. And the fact that <i>Young Team</i>'s influence can still be felt across the international indie-sphere-- not just in kindred art-rock spirits like Sigur Rós and Explosions in the Sky, but also avant-metal outfits like Boris and Pelican-- means the album exists today as something more vibrant than a museum piece.</p>
<p>For a mostly instrumental band, Mogwai have developed a reputation in the media for being big mouths who take no small delight in slagging other bands (hey guys, how about a 10th-anniversary reissue of those ""blur: are shite"" t-shirts?) and praising themselves. However, the spoken-word intro-- a friend reading out a gushing student-paper review of an early Mogwai performance-- that ushers in the slow-burn rapture of <i>Young Team</i>'s ""Yes! I Am Long Way From Home"" feels less like a cheeky self-aggrandizing device than a rejection of the hollow Britpop hyperbole that was endemic to the era. But if Mogwai were determined to distance themselves from prevailing retro-rock fashions, <i>Young Team</i> evinced a nostalgic streak of its own, particularly for the pre-Britpop moment of 1988-91, when indie rock bands both American (Slint, Mercury Rev) and British (My Bloody Valentine, Bark Psychosis) were obliterating the parameters of rock music (and the VU meters that quantify them), before those groups either dissolved or turned more classic rock. So in a sense, <i>Young Team</i> was tending to unfinished business, bridging the continuum the connects shoegaze psychedelia to the anti-pop aesthetic and rhythmic thrust of the then-emergent post-rock.</p>
<p>But, of course, what distinguished Mogwai from the multitude of all-instrumental outfits jockeying for a Thrill Jockey deal was that their post-rock actually rocked. And to this day, nothing in their catalogue attests to this fact more than <i>Young Team</i>'s startling second track, ""Like Herod"". Even when you heard it the first time, you knew the song's silently stalking momentum-- guided by Dominic Aitchison's deceptively melodic bassline-- would trigger an eruption of heavy-metal thunder that sounded like Slint soundtracking the shower scene in <i>Psycho</i>. But the tension lies not in question of whether the bomb is going to drop, but when, and this re-mastered reissue does a superb job of prolonging that feeling of impending doom-- during the song's second quiet stretch, you can hear Stuart Braithwaite and John Cummings' fretboard taps panning back and forth in the mix, like an unseen predator taunting you from some unseen location in the shadows before going in for a particularly savage kill. And after 11 years, I'm still never quite prepared for it.</p>
<p>At 11 minutes, ""Like Herod"" is actually only <i>Young Team</i>'s second longest song; that honour belongs to 16-minute closer ""Mogwai Fear Satan"". Rather than resorting to sudden dynamic shifts, <i>Young Team</i>'s colossal closer masterfully layers sheets of distortion, percussion and flute swirls over a repeated, ascending three-chord progression that-- despite the cacophony swarming around it-- projects a remarkable sense of calm. These two titanic tracks-- still staples of the band's live set-- have traditionally overshadowed the rest of <i>Young Team</i>'s tracklist; listening to the album in its entirety today, what strikes you most is not so much Mogwai's brute force, but that these erstwhile piss-takers are capable of moments of great beauty and sensitivity: On the glockenspiel-gilded ballad ""Tracy"", random phone conversations are threaded into the mix, casting the mundane chit-chat in a overwhelmingly melancholic light, rendering the track as a requiem for someone who's no longer with us; on ""R U Still In 2 It""-- <i>Young Team</i>'s lone vocal track-- guest singer Aidan Moffatt of Arab Strap duets with Braithwaite on a devastating anti-love song that vividly captures a dead-end relationship being strung along by declarations of non-commital commitment.</p>
<p>Given how prolific Mogwai were in their formative years, much of what would normally be considered for anniversary-edition extras was already released 10 years ago, in the form of the <i>Ten Rapid</i> singles collection, the <i>4 Satin</i> and <i>No Education = No Future (Fuck the Curfew)</i> EPs and the <i>Kicking a Dead Pig</i> remix collection. So all that this reissue's second ""Appendix"" disc can offer is one unreleased track (the suitably mournful ""Young Face Gone Wrong""), a couple of compilation rarities, and a hearty serving of <i>Young Team</i> concert/radio-session recordings. The band's faithful version of Spacemen 3's ""Honey"" (taken from a 1998 tribute album) provides insight into Mogwai's more melodic influences, and seven-inch obscurity ""I Can't Remember"" finds the band toying around with a DJ Shadow-esque drum loop, but the live tracks mostly stick to the script-- the one revelation being that, in concert, Mogwai seem to be in more of a hurry to plow through ""Like Herod"" and ""Mogwai Fear Satan"", lopping several minutes off of each. Still, the version of ""Satan"" that closes this collection-- taken from Chemikal Underground's fifth anniversary party in 2000-- does add one sound effect that the original <i>Young Team</i> version merely implied: the sound of ecstatic applause confirming minds well blown.</p></div>"|11600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11600-young-team-deluxe-edition/|9.2|Stuart Berman

Vocals went from being little smears in the mix to fully-formed, coherent carriers of melody and understandable lyrics, rhythms lost some of their krautrockiness, and they generally became a better band. As of their eighth LP, the band's always-fluctuating membership stands at five, with Jason McNeely and Dan Matz in the lead, as always.</p><p>
    They haven't totally abandoned their old post-rocking ways-- they're still as much about sound as they are about songs, and some of this record's inconsistency stems from relapses into meandering soundscapes, albeit mostly brief ones. Little ambient doodles like the mostly inert ""Robin Robinette"" and the disheveled-sounding ""Troubles"", which features guitar playing totally out of rhythm along with barely discernible mumble-singing, just don't fit anymore amidst cranking, memorable rock songs such as ""Maladies"" or ""Fallen Off the Earth"".</p><p>
    The first two thirds of the album are mostly filled with crisp songs. Opener ""Let Go"" rises from a placid tone pool into a moody, minimal number with floating, doubled vocals, fluttering organ figures, and a nice, clean guitar part-- it's supremely uncluttered and bodes well for the rest of the album. ""Maladies"" largely delivers on the promise with its thumping beat, good guitar riffs, and fantastic wordless chorus. ""Hold On"" and ""Fallen Off the Earth"" flow in a similar vein, falling back a bit more on the band's familiar motorik-derived sense of rhythm, while the nicely understated guitar-and-voice track ""Forgotten"" features possibly Windsor's best lyrics to date, with simple ruminations on being remembered and growing old.
    </p><p>
    Then there's the matter of the album's final third, which takes a headfirst dive into grainy shoegazer territory with little in the way of warning. Though ""What We Want"" is actually quite good, subsuming the noisy guitars in favor of organ and harmony vocals, it stills feels disjointed next to what comes before, and the other two closing songs aren't as memorable. Indeed, after years of indecision as to what kind of band they wanted to be, Windsor for the Derby seem to have finally opted against ever deciding. And that's really not a bad thing-- while it's not a masterpiece or terribly cohesive, <em>How We Lost</em> still manages to pack a lot of interesting and even excellent music into its 36 minutes.

While you can get the gist of their concert experience from breathless online reports and YouTube clips, suffice to say, if you don't want to be covered in more than a few bodily fluids, lift musicians and their equipment in the air with your hands as they play, see flames leap from cymbals (an old trick that's still pretty dangerous), and stare into the hoary pockmarked face of rock'n'roll itself, then whatever you do, don't go see Monotonix live. So when it comes to their records, short of the CD spitting on you the moment you crack open the case, it's gonna fall short.</p><p>
    That said, the band's debut EP is an inspired slab of no-frills, no-nonsense guitar rock that stands in the shadow of vintage metal while stretching out for a few genuine surprises. For a band that names one of its songs ""No Metal"", <em>Body Language</em> sure has its share of palm-muted and bottom-heavy riffs, charmingly over-the-top vocals, and even ominous, maniacal laughter on ""Deadly Weapon"". Metal is definitely part of the record's appeal-- most especially for those singeing opening notes of ""Summers and Autumns""-- but that's not where it ends. Monotonix certainly nods to a few hip hard-rock influences, from Sabbath to ZZ Top to maybe even a little early Iron Maiden, but there's more to it than that. They're far more fluid than most two-man guitar/drums lineups, as guitarist Yonatan Gat slides in and out of solos without ever throwing the rhythm off the rails. There's serious synergy between him and drummer Ran Shimoni as the latter underlines every whim of the guitar on ""Summers and Autumns"" while and anchoring every stop-on-dime turn, and maintains this grasp from the sleek and relatively straightforward riffery of ""Deadly Weapon"" to the go-nuttery guitar of ""No Metal"".</p><p>
    ""Body Language"" has the most headbanging rhythm and conspicuous guitar licks on the EP, but it also throws in a cascading piano riff over the song's tricky turnaround that goes a long way to color the track, and keeps the record itself from getting too homogeneous. The descending guitar line that follows is sweet and yearning enough to fit onto a damn Strokes record; It's a hell of a hodgepodge that makes its four minutes seem epic, and it all flows seamlessly. Singer Ami Shalev navigates every turn with an exaggerated croon that can taunt, plead, and terrify as the situation demands. The EP stands up as a whole, but it's these kids of details that bode well for future releases that could do more than lure listeners to the band's stage show.  As it is, this is a promising start.</p></div>"|11573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11573-body-language/|6.7|Jason Crock

That's Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, who shared a bedroom into their teens and went on, with their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine (replaced for a time by David Marks), to form a band that's still cemented in the American consciousness 50 years later. Brian Wilson was the driving creative force in the band, taking his love of Chuck Berry, doo-wop and Phil Spector's widescreen L.A. pop sound, adding a large helping of his brother Dennis's surfing hobby and California car culture, and creating a sound all his own.</p><p>
    The evolution of that sound is on full display across the 16 discs of Capitol's new <em>U.S. Singles Collection: The Capitol Years</em>, which covers the group's 45 output from 1962 to mid-1965, oddly stopping in the middle of that year without including ""She's Not the Little Girl I Once Knew"" and ""Barbara Ann"". The box is available digitally, but the real draw for fans will be the limited-edition boxed set, which includes a book, 15 singles ,and one ""bonus single,"" each on its own disc with a reproduction sleeve, plus 32 bonus tracks distributed across the set and mostly consisting of alternate stereo mixes. It's a lavish treatment-- definitely not carbon-neutral, but it does have the effect of turning back the clock a bit to a time when listeners had to engage more closely with records, physically changing the disc when the song was over.</p><p>
    Brian was 19 when the band formed in 1961 (as the Pendeltones) and just beginning to flex the songwriting and arranging muscles he'd developed in his childhood from watching his father Murray play piano and taking music classes in high school. Though a newly minted adult, he and his band set about building a musical monument to early 60s teen culture that had an odd resonance across the U.S. in spite of its focus on surfing and hot rods, which were very specific to California at the time. It was the soundtrack to the sort of endless summer that a kid in Minnesota or Connecticut could only dream of, and it was packed with enough detail to paint a vivid picture for record-buying kids who had never seen an ocean.
    </p><p>
    This set understandably doesn't include the band's debut single, ""Surfin'"", which was released on the independent X label in late 1961 and managed to hit #75. Instead, it begins with their major label debut, ""Surfin Safari"", backed with ""409"". It was a perfect kick-off, with the band's trademark harmonies setting up both of the band's early obsessions, surfing and fast cars. It's hardly a masterpiece, but the A-side is infectious and creates a perfect mental image of guys in trunks running across the sand with their boards, beach-attired girls behind them. 
    </p>
<p>
    If you grew up in the 60s or around oldies radio in the decades that followed, you undoubtedly have ""Fun, Fun, Fun, ""Little Deuce Coupe"", ""I Get Around"", ""Shut Down"", and ""Surfin' USA"" memorized, but in a lot of ways these songs don't even tell half the story. Even at the very beginning, you can hear Brian Wilson's creative restlessness shining through. The band's second Capitol single, ""Ten Little Indians"" b/w ""County Fair"", is certifiably awful on both sides, but ""County Fair"" makes interesting use of bullhorn-wielding carnies in its arrangement and offers an early hint at some of the uncertainty that would ultimately bubble up through Wilson's work as the girl he goes to the fair with leaves him with another guy, calling him a loser in the process.
    </p>
<p>
    The early slow songs show an amazingly mature compositional sense. ""Surfer Girl"", with a melody inspired by ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", is a wonderful waltz-time ballad that gives us a spine-tingling early taste of Mike Love's ability to handle slow songs with rich emotion. The song is full of pie-in-the-sky promises and self-conscious reality checks-the protagonist tentatively asks his love interest, ""Do you love me?"" ""In My Room"" leaves behind the surf and exhaust  for quiet introspection-- it's hard to imagine a single teenager anywhere in America not being able to identify with wanting a space of one's own in which to brood over the day's drama.
    </p>
<p>
    The psychological dichotomy of the Beach Boys-- and more specifically Brian Wilson-- is most prominently on display on that 45: ""In My Room"" is the B-side of ""Be True to Your School"", a boastful account of athletic prowess and school spirit that also features an imaginative arrangement complete with cheerleaders. The backing tracks are handled by crack L.A. session players, whose skill gave Wilson wide latitude in his arrangements. Capitol includes an instrumental backing track for ""I Get Around"" a few discs later that is just astounding in its precision and complexity. That song's B-side, ""Don't Worry Baby"", was Wilson's attempt to capture the feel of the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"", his favorite song. Led by his own falsetto vocal, what he wound up with has a different feel, but its sophistication and sweeping melody place it on par with its inspiration nonetheless. 
    </p>
<p>
    By this point it was the middle of 1964 and the band was headed inexorably away from its roots and toward something more enduring and powerful. ""She Knows Me Too Well"" is a heartbreaking and exquisitely arranged song that has Love sifting through his relationship with his girlfriend and essentially finding that while he loves her, he's also a jerk who can't stop himself from hurting her with his roving eye. ""The Warmth of the Sun"" is another tremendous slow song, borrowing its slow 6/8 sway from some of the best doo-wop of the 50s but pointing the way toward Brian Wilson's most ambitious work. 
    </p>
<p>
    In 1964, he was already experimenting with hand percussion, harps, tympanis and other ways to augment the band's sound, but it was at the end of the year, when he quit touring with the band following a nervous breakdown, that Wilson truly became free to expand on his ideas as he wanted to. He'd felt pressure from the British Invasion to innovate for over a year, and it's hard to argue against what he came up with. B-sides ""Please Let Me Wonder"" and ""Kiss Me, Baby"", neither of which charted, are both pretty enough to raise the hair on the back of your neck, but both were lost on the flip sides of mega-hits, the latter attached to ""Help Me Rhonda,"" the band's second #1. 
    </p>
<p>
    These discs chart an amazingly steady build-up to the final single they catalog, ""California Girls"" b/w ""Let Him Run Wild"". Though there will always be debate as to the worth of the A-side's lyrics, the music, a stately stomp that sets jaunty organ to dissonant horns, swinging bass and multiple tambourines, is undeniable. In July of 1965, it was a Technicolor re-affirmation of the endless summer, but don't forget the B-side. ""Let Him Run Wild"" is nearly as good and a clear sonic blueprint for <em>Pet Sounds</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    This box is an interesting look at the warts-and-all development of America's Band, though I hesitate to call it essential for anyone but the band's most dedicated and invested fans. Apart from a live version of ""409"" recorded in Chicago after Brian Wilson had stopped touring, all eight previously unreleased tracks are alternate mixes, so there are no major revelations. To that end, it's more the object that commands the price, and it is a very attractive object. For the more casual listener, though, there are plenty of other ways to obtain these singles.

    Rockist habits die hard-- if you don't believe me, go to the
    nearest used CD store and spin a N.E.R.D. album.  Trust me, they'll be there.  While the Neptunes' space-age synths and
    bucket percussion spawned literally dozens of pop hits over the past decade, even
    as contemporaries like Timbaland and Kanye West were becoming muso darlings, these
    Tidewater gadflies were mostly denied any sort of <em>serious</em> credibility until they got critics back into their comfort
    zone by hitching their sound to Hulk Smash palm-mute riffs and live drums.  At which point everyone went kinda overboard,
    as Brent DiCrescenzo put it in a review of 2004's <em>Fly or Die</em>, ""limit[ing] their vocabulary to the Hall of Fame"" while
    lauding some of the weakest material Pharrell Williams, Chad Hugo, and Shay ever came up with.  At least <em>In
    Search Of... </em>had enough juice to be called uneven, but the musical priorities
    of <em>Fly or Die </em>were so out of whack, only
    the most determined contrarian could possibly still be listening to it.  Needless to say, all those breathless ""future
    of music"" plaudits were probably anticipating a more profound result of
    N.E.R.D.'s influence in 2008 than kids in tight pants learning how to pull a fakie ollie.</p><p>
    So yeah, the bar's been set far lower for <em>Seeing Sounds</em>, which by default makes it
    a more satisfying experience-- it<em> </em>can even
    be backhandedly complimented as a comeback of sorts by mere virtue of not being
    noticeably worse than what came before it. 
    But the continuing problem of N.E.R.D. is that it's nearly impossible to
    figure out how much you should invest in them, or really how much they're
    invested in it-- as the group's public voice, Pharrell has never shied away from
    claims of helming some sort of polyglot musical mastermind, and free of their
    commercial burdens, N.E.R.D.<em> </em>should
    ostensibly document their unfettered genius. 
    And then they release songs that chop it up with Good Charlotte, compare
    female asses to spaceships, and on lead single ""Everybody Nose (All the Girls Standing in the Line for the Bathroom)"", P lampoons
    partygoing cokeheads by sounding like Baha Men after five too many rails.  If you're looking to soundtrack scenes of
    ""Real World: Hollywood"" housemates dry-fucking each other at Geisha House (""jump around like
    you're ADHD! ADHD!"" goes ""Anti-Matter""), <em>Seeing
    Sounds </em>might be worthy of regular rotation, but for the rest of us, it's
    just another baffling, obnoxious mess of ""serious fun"" from a squad whose glory
    days are getting harder to remember.</p><p>
    It almost feels silly pointing out how brazenly they're
    wielding Occam's Razor here: Were <em>Seeing
    Sounds </em>just a collection of hooks or beats, it might not be half bad.  I can't imagine too many people in Starboard
    P's Rolodex turning down the sass mouthed chorus of ""Anti-Matter"" or the gleaming
    harmonies of ""Sooner or Later"", but neither disparages the idea of actual
    songwriting being far down the list of what N.E.R.D. is actually good at.  The former gets marooned from the rest of the
    song as they go into a rampage fueled by equal parts Red Bull and Roni Size,
    and as for the latter, it's ironic that P swipes the piano part from ""Changes"",
    since they repeat themselves so often over the span of nearly <em>seven </em>minutes of nebulous breakup
    malaise that you'll wonder if you got a faulty leak.    
    </p>
<p>
    Like its unexpected stylistic kin My Morning Jacket's <em>Evil Urges</em>, <em>Seeing Sounds </em>finds
    its creators partaking in the subversively phallocentric narcissism of staring
    at their CD collections, confusing music listening with music <em>understanding</em> rather than enjoyment. At first blush, ""Windows""
    nicely jerry-rigs an octave-toggling surf riff to some eerily Sting-ish backing
    vocals, but get past that surface pleasure and you're treated to Pharrell's
    typically priapic lyrics, rhyming the title with ""she's a 10, yo,"" among other
    things (mostly ""yo"").  ""Happy"" is
    N.E.R.D.'s shoegaze moment (no, really), albeit with a complete
    misunderstanding of the production dynamics-- despite all those flanger sound
    effects, it's about as immersive as a thimble and could just as easily be
    coming out of a Sega Genesis.  And then
    there's ""Kill Joy"", which along with Lil' Wayne's ""Mrs. Officer"", augurs a
    scary possibility that rappers are starting to rediscover deep cuts from <em>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    At the very least, some will feel better knowing that
    Pharrell and Chad are apparently speaking again, even if playing 52 pickup with
    genre is becoming the only fun of N.E.R.D. albums as opposed to
    considering every track a battle to see whether P first gets bored of his
    lyrics or his melodies; it's a tough call on ""Yeah You"", four minutes of
    quiet storm drizzle about being stalked via e-mail.  But in an odd way, <em>Seeing Sounds </em>is a liberating listen-- clearly, N.E.R.D. are
    beholden to no one but themselves and a kind ear can at least enjoy the almost
    Zen-like nothingness of the Black Card Era: all withdrawal, no deposit.

    French rock and pop, when not being dismissed outright, are often discussed only in terms of English-language antecedents. Johnny Hallyday brings to mind Elvis, for example, and the chameleonic, hedonistic Serge Gainsbourg is sometimes compared to David Bowie-- the latter despite being a predecessor. Even in the French experimental and electronic communities, this tendency has reduced France's historical context. Magma is often filed away from its country in the auspices of the krautrock section, Parisian synth-punk groups like Metal Urbain are often viewed as a dark answer to-- you guessed it-- punk, and progressive and electronic composers like Richard Pinhas languish in the shadows of Manuel Göttsching, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler. But Pinhas, whose <em>Single Collection 1972-1980</em> has recently been issued by Japan's Captain Trip label, has left just as long a legacy as any of his German contemporaries. This CD compiles a number of Pinhas's early 7"" singles, all released before the de facto beginning of his solo career, the 1980 masterpiece <em>Iceland</em>.</p><p>
    Even at his best, Pinhas also isn't above being directly influenced by his forebears. Alongside his solo work, the disc also chronicles Pinhas's work in the witty blues-based psych-rock outfit Schizo, as well as his Berlin School-influenced sequencer work with Heldon and his further experimentations in that scene as THX. Pinhas exhibited a fluidity that moved in the flowing undercurrent of technology in the mid-1970s, adopting the Moog and later sequencer sounds of his contemporaries with a decidedly direct approach to melody. These singles show Pinhas never shying away from synthesized or guitar-based leads at the outset, spurning the patient, sometimes half-hour long approaches adopted by Schulze and others in the Berlin camp. Even ""Baader-Meinhof Blues"", an eight-minute Heldon tune that owes a lot to Tangerine Dream's <em>Rubycon</em> and <em>Phaedra</em>, wastes little time in developing a bass synthesizer progression, and then an oblique distorted guitar lead.</p><p>
    Pinhas' solo work is some of the most arresting on the compilation. ""West Side"", one of the few vocal pieces outside of the Schizo singles, strikingly combines his dense electronic pulse with the anthemic noise of the emerging new wave. ""Beautiful May"" also hints at his increasing use of melodic synthesizers such as those on Brian Eno's <em>Another Green World</em> and his future use of tape-delayed guitar, a la Robert Fripp. Unfortunately, the Fripp &amp; Eno comparison might be the most troubling of all that can be drawn with Richard Pinhas, especially considering that his later works like 1996's <em>De l'Un et du Multiple</em> (also recently re-issued on Captain Trip) rely on delay systems similar to Frippertronics. But as both that record and <em>Single</em> show, Pinhas composes with the intent of translating the sometimes obscure lexicon of technology with the wit and honesty he's carried since his absurdist Schizo days. Maybe the best defense for Pinhas-- hell, for all alleged French imitators-- is not that he took from those who came before him, it's that he took what came before him and made some damned sense out of it.

But<br/>
    the kind of scary that Bryan deals in is of a decidedly <em>Rocky Horror</em> variety: His second album, <em>Flight of the Knife</em>, sucks in all kinds of 1970s-- the canonic glitter-rock of Sparks and Queen, the MOR pop of Wings and ELO, and the fleet-fingered prog of Yes and early Genesis-- but its crafty construction betrays a staunch determination to make a whole decade of once-guilty pleasures feel innocent all over again.</p><p>
    Ironically, one definitive 70s rock act that Bryan Scary doesn't immediately bring to mind is Roxy Music-- in contrast to his namesake Ferry's debonair cool, Bryan Scary projects a gentle, childlike presence that seems forever on the verge of being overpowered by the time-signature trickery and noodly arpeggios swirling around him. But like Bob Pollard and Carl Newman before him, Scary understands that prog-rock is really just psychedelic pop with the between-song gaps removed-- and if you want people to buy into your crazy cosmic concepts, you better make sure they have something to sing along to first. The end game is not so much prog as power-pop with chops.</p><p>
    That <em>Flight of the Knife</em>'s title track is broken up into two book-end tracks-- the first, a rhapsodic overture complete with jazz-funk interludes, the latter a rollicking, boogie-woogie-- implies some sort of overarching storyline (in short: the sky is high and space is the place), and the ecstatic energy with which Scary prances through character pieces like the celestial ""Venus Ambassador"" and the giddy, piano-pounded  freak-out ""Imitation of the Sky"" suggests he’s already fantasizing about a crossover theatrical adaptation. But it'll be one narrative logic takes a back seat to spectacle: in just four minutes, ""The Purple Rocket"" alternates between head-bopping power-pop and jarring prog-jazz breaks, before settling on a ""ba ba da ba ba” group chorus that sounds like a jingle for a kids' cereal commercial-- for no apparent reason other than it can.</p><p>
    Scary's aggressively eager showmanship and ADD-addled arrangements threaten to exhaust himself and his audience equally-- by the time we hit the plasticine pop of ""Son of Stab"", the song's whip-lashed change-ups feel more the product of indecision than ingenuity. So the penultimate piano ballad ""Heaven on a Bird"" feels all the more triumphant for its McCartneyian modesty: ""It's such a fantasy,"" Scary admits of the titular travel plan, but if heaven is out of the question, he'll at least settle for Broadway.</p></div>"|11570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11570-flight-of-the-knife/|6.6|Stuart Berman

It's in this latter category that you'd likely find Paul Haig, not that the former Josef K leader has been doing much about it. Like fellow Scottish post-punk stalwarts Orange Juice, Josef K burned bright but briefly, and unlike former Orange Juice frontman Edwyn Collins, Haig has had a mostly overlooked solo career-- much of it spent shifting his attention from strummy guitars to slick dance pop. But frustrated that his commercial aspirations never quite bore fruit, Haig more or less fell from view, his erratic back catalog in and out of print save for Josef K's brilliant output.</p><p>
    Don't call it a comeback, but, well, the Paul Haig some know and love has returned. A recent Scottish show marked Haig's first live set in almost 20 years, and by all accounts the music leaned heavy on the guitar.  Not that <em>Go Out Tonight</em> is any less of a dance record than some of its predecessors, but it takes only a few seconds into opener ""Trouble Maker"" before Haig's trademark angular and funky guitar shards enter the fray. If the music sounds more like mid-period New Order or even late-era Wire than prime Josef K, Haig at least seems interested in re-engaging with his roots.</p><p>
    Songs like ""Stay Mine"" and the closing gem ""Gone in a Moment"" are equally indebted to early 1980s UK indie, though the bulk of <em>Go Out Tonight</em> is more amorphous in its meeting of synth-pop and rock. It's in this in-between place where you'll find tender ballads like ""Believe"", buoyed by acoustic guitar and some old school programming or the more propulsive rave-ups ""Shut Down"" and ""Data Retro"". </p><p>
    Then again, it's hard to tell if the likes of ""Hippy Dippy Pharmaceutically Trippy"" is terrible or tolerable, and ""Fantasize"" and ""Acidic Snowdrop"" both feel at least a couple of decades of dance music off. Indeed, as pop goes, <em>Go Out Tonight</em> teeters on the edge of piffle, and rarely comes close to brilliant. Still, you can't begrudge Haig's belated if ultimately half-hearted attempts to seize the spotlights. Maybe he's a star in his own mind, if not in the real world, but the fact that he's at least welcoming others to his own little modest party is at least some compensation for all those years in the wilderness, no doubt spent doggedly looking for the perfect beat.</p></div>"|11564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11564-go-out-tonight/|5.2|Joshua Klein

    My first impression of Truls Heggero was neither positive
    nor, fortunately, reliable. Moments after I popped in Truls &amp; the Trees'
    debut album, <em>Ailanthus</em>, into my computer, I unfolded the CD insert and found
    the poster of the Norwegian singer/songwriter/mastermind dressed in full Boy
    Scout garb (or the Scandinavian equivalent), holding an acoustic guitar and
    looking pensively into the distance-- a visionary in arrested development.
    Initially I feared this would be just another indie-cute collective with overly
    twee hooks and lyrics that could have come from <em>The Dangerous Book for Boys</em>, but soon realized how off base I was.
    Heggero may be a prodigiously ambitious musician with a gift for witty,
    sprawling arrangements full of offbeat instrumentation and plenty of musical
    gambits (not unlike fellow Scout uniform wearer Sufjan Stevens), but his songs
    rarely announce themselves as particularly over the top or elaborate.
    He wants to deliver the goods directly to the listener-- the demonstrative
    hook, the headlong jam, the thrumming ambience, the unexpected coda-- and it
    only helps that his vocals range from androgynous and adenoidal (think Isaac
    Brock via Placebo's Brian Molko) to a stage-whisper falsetto suggestive of
    Sigur Rós's Jon Thor Birgisson.</p><p>
    Apparently, Heggero's brain runneth over, such that he needs
    not one, but two bands to get all his ideas out there. Releasing albums just
    months apart, the spacier Lukestar and the earthier Truls &amp; the Trees show
    off slightly different aspects of his musical personality. Of the two,
    Lukestar's <em>Lake</em><em> </em><em>Toba</em>, the follow-up to 2004's <em>Alpine Unit</em>, has received more attention
    and is slated for a U.S.
    release this fall on Flameshovel. The title refers to the Sumatran volcanic
    lake that erupted eons ago and may have changed the course of human evolution.
    So much for modesty. Nevertheless, it's perhaps the more accessible, if not necessarily
    the more enjoyable, of the two albums, a solid collection of pulsing indie-rock
    songs with half-shouted hooks and guitars unwinding like fractal art. Opener
    ""White Shade"" and ""The Shade You Hide"" are Wrensy frenzies of manic guitars
    propelled by drummer Jørgen Smådal Larsen's tricky rhythms and imaginative
    fills. ""The Clouds Tell"" offers a floating-in-space interlude before the band
    blast off again on the zig-zagging ""In a Hologram"". Still, the album winds down
    as it proceeds: Lukestar can't maintain that creative intensity, letting the
    hooks soften and the arrangements lose some of their purposefulness.</p><p>
    Conceptually, Truls &amp; the Trees works as a rustic
    flipside-project to Lukestar: Instead of a firm five-piece, it's a loosely
    defined collective ranging from six to sixteen members, depending on the time
    and place. To call the group an earthy counterpart doesn't mean the Trees are
    strictly acoustic or folksy, just less streamlined and more grounded. They even
    open their debut, <em>Ailanthus</em> (named
    for the fast-growing deciduous often referred to as the ""tree of heaven""), with
    ""Aim Vs. Signal"", a full minute of squiggling synths. Similarly, these songs squirm away from expectations. Dag Stiberg's
    saxophone opens up the halting ""Mystaxxx"", making its dreamy atmospherics sound
    all the richer as drummer Larsen taps out Morse code rhythms on his snare rim,
    and ""Count Your Steps"" and the title track both race impatiently, doing
    somersaults as they run downhill. Stand-out ""Upside Journey"" sports an emphatic
    hook and a barreling momentum, then crashes into a Dexy's Midnight Runners
    breakdown on the coda. The one real joykill is closer ""Topquark Journey to the
    Center of the Universe"", which revisits ""Upside Journey"" but in a stiffly
    electronic style that ends the album on an uncharacteristically humdrum note. Still,
    while Lukestar's rock-band format necessarily limits their range, Truls &amp;
    the Trees aren't quite a rock band or quite anything else, and with that
    unsettledness comes the freedom to do anything they want.

    electronic style that ends the album on an uncharacteristically humdrum note. Still,
    while Lukestar's rock-band format necessarily limits their range, Truls &amp;
    the Trees aren't quite a rock band or quite anything else, and with that
    unsettledness comes the freedom to do anything they want.

<em>""Where the fuck is my guitar?""</em></p><p>
    Lil Wayne is a terrible guitarist. Just incredibly bad. The fact was evident at this year's Summer Jam, when he spent two and a half
    interminable minutes noodling and crooning all by his lonesome while a
    stadium full of New York's most devout hip-hop fans looked on
    bewildered. ""Is he really playing the guitar right now?"" giggled a
    teenage girl. ""That's not a chord or anything!"" Still, she recorded
    Wayne in all his tatted-up Tracy Chapman glory for YouTube posterity just the same. While everyone else on the day's bill-- from Alicia Keys to Kanye
    West-- filled their shortened, festival-style sets with hits and
    finely-tailored theatrics, the audience's most anticipated act took the
    opportunity get his <em>Guitar for Dummies</em> on; Lil Wayne is, as he likes to
    say, ""different."" Always has been.</p><p>
    Earmarked
    as a gifted elementary school student in New Orleans, he became
    the token prodigy of his hometown's Cash Money clique at the age of 16, spitting
    pipsqueak gangsterisms over skittering Mannie Fresh beats.  And, opposed to
    the typical rap flame-out trajectory, Wayne got better-- and stranger-- with each album. Now, nine years after his first solo LP, and on the
    heels of an unprecedented glut of increasingly remarkable mixtape and internet leaks, we get <em>Tha
    Carter III</em>, the epic culmination of a lifetime of eccentricities. This is Wayne's moment and
    he embraces it on his own terms. Instead of hiding his bootleg-bred
    quirks in anticipation of the big-budget spotlight, he distills the
    myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting
    emotions into a commercially gratifying package that's as weird as it
    wants to be; he eventually finds his guitar but keeps the strumming in check.</p><p>
<em>""I pay my dues, you keep the difference.""</em></p><p>
    As
    the major music industry continues to wheeze and splinter, Lil Wayne's spitball marketing plan for <em>C3</em> is an unprecedented masterstroke.
    Over the past couple of years, he's given away more worthwhile free music online than most artists of his stature ever release officially. Using the mixtape
    market as a free-for-all training ground, Wayne expanded his persona,
    voice, and talent while presumptively killing off thousands of wannabe MCs hoping to charge five bucks for some garbage CD-R. For that alone, he
    deserves thanks. Wayne set the definition for a Web 2.0 MC-- his
    output pours through computer speakers at broadband speeds. And while stellar tapes like
    <em>Dedication 2</em> and <em>Da Drought 3</em> offered-up plenty of hidden darts for
    sun-deprived message board nerds, his Just Say Yes policy toward any
    and all guest invitations (Enrique Iglesias? Why not!) provided maximum
    visibility and chiseled his radio-friendly chops. Piggybacking on hits
    by Chris Brown and Lloyd undoubtedly did wonders for his
    giggling teenage girl fan base, but a lesser-known assist appears to have had
    an even bigger effect on the new record.</p><p>
<em>""Gotta work everyday/ Gotta not be cliché/ Gotta stand out like Andre 3K.""</em></p><p>
    One of the few satisfying tracks on OutKast's bungled <em>Idlewild</em>
    album was a woozy bitchfest called ""Hollywood Divorce"" featuring Lil
    Wayne. In hindsight, the invite feels like an act of sanctification. The song's a lesson in winning idiosyncrasies-- Andre, Big Boi, and Wayne are all salty, but they make sure to side-step pessimism (Big Boi deems rumor mongers ""M&amp;M's with no nuts""). Traces of the South's most genre-bursting, P-Funk-worshipping ATLiens
    can be heard all over <em>C3</em>, from Wayne's staccato phrasing on ""Mr.
    Carter"" to the extraterrestrial fetishism of ""Phone Home"" to the eclectic unpredictability of it all. The musical open-mindedness
    also lifts <em>C3</em> above regional niches-- the #1 hit
    ""Lollipop"" sounds more like it was born on Jupiter than anywhere on earth. While Wayne isn't quite ready to produce something like ""Hey
    Ya!"", don't be shocked if you see him held up by a
    pair of leprechaun suspenders in the not-so-distant future. </p><p>
<em>""I've done it before, please don't make me do it no more.""</em></p><p>
<em>C3</em>
    is Wayne's most absurd album to date but it's also his most
    personal. ""Shoot Me Down"", with its ""Lose Yourself""-style
    guitar chug and ominous hook, has the rapper looking all the way back
    to age 12, when he accidentally shot himself with a .44 Magnum while
    toying with the gun in a mirror. ""Two more inches I'd have been in that
    casket/ According to the doctor I could've died in traffic,"" he rhymes
    on ""3 Peat"", possibly referring to the day in 2001 when a disgruntled
    groupie shot at his tour bus, planting a bullet in his chest. Such
    details add even more gravitas to his grizzled, elastic timbre,
    which suggests an impossibly hoarse (and high) David Ruffin at times. ""All I ask is don't take our love for granted,"" sings a perfectly sympathetic Babyface alongside Wayne on the lush ballad ""Comfortable"", the line coming off more like a saucer-eyed plea than a threat. And the LP's best track doubles as its most crazed and pained.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Playing With Fire"" is a full-on faux-metal stunner that hearkens back to Bad Boy's cinematic peak.
    On it, Wayne reaches Ghostface levels of paranoid distress: ""I'm doin' the same shit Martin Luther King did/ Checkin' in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch/ Same balcony like <em>assassinate me, bitch!</em>"" His claims of MLK grandeur are far-fetched, but his impassioned delivery makes them seem more believable than one would think possible. Apparently, those Biggie and Pac
    references are getting to his codeine-addled brain-- after all, at 25, Wayne
    is now older than both legends were when they were gunned down. The
    implicit danger of carrying on such a legacy only adds to the rapper's
    dramatic reading, and his anguish burns as hot as his punchlines.</p><p>
<em>""I think everybody gonna like this one...I got one!""</em></p><p>
    Considering his running-faucet leak rate, there are bound to be fanboy quibbles about the intricacies of <em>C3</em>'s tracklist (e.g., the buoyant web gem ""La La La"" should replace ""La La"" and its braindead Busta Rhymes verse, and what about the hazy ""I Feel Like Dying"" or the
    promising speed-soul track ""3 a.m.""?). But considering there are probably
    several hard drives stuffed with syrupy odes featuring Wayne's dubious
    auto-tuned howl, the final tally is exquisitely balanced and considered. After dozens of listens, the record's overflowing minutiae-- from Fabulous and Juelz Santana's overachieving cameos to Wayne's hilariously apropos kinship with ""Macho Man""
    Randy Savage-- still feels limitless. Just as
    the record's cover playfully skews the <em>Ready to Die</em>/<em>Illmatic</em> baby-picture formula with Photoshopped
    tattoos, Wayne updates what it means to be the best rapper alive here.
    Gangster dandy. Fender-slinging sex god. Intergalactic prankster. It's
    all in him.

    Sloan never really fell off, but they've often been taken for granted. 
    You know how it goes with American critics-- make a bunch of classicist pop comparisons, wonder
    why they aren't as big in the U.S. as they are in Canada, slap three stars
    on it, move on to something with more cachet and see you in two years.  Which leads me to believe that the
    surprisingly muted reception of 2006's <em>Never
    Hear the End of It </em>was the result of no one really knowing what to do with
    it.  Clocking in at 30-tracks with a
    suite-like flow (more like an avalanche), the record didn't reprogram the
    parameters of Sloan's sound so much as their scope-- this sort of ambition
    played completely against type, and were it the work of a younger band, there's
    a good chance, well, you'd never hear the end of it.</p><p>
    Which puts <em>Parallel
    Play </em>in a strange position of being a follow-up to a breakthrough album
    that never really broke through.  At
    least that's what one might think judging from its decidedly more restrained 13-track, 37-minute dimensions.  But <em>Parallel Play </em>isn't a reaction to the
    excess of <em>Never
    Hear the End of It</em><em> </em>so
    much as a consolidation of its strengths. 
    As before, each song careens into each other with nary a second in
    between, which can distract from the real reason this feels so consistent-- Sloan continue to sound more like a <em>band </em>than
    four distinct songwriters, a set-up which has arguably led to some accusing
    them of lacking distinction.</p><p>
    Having taken their Beatles fixations to a logical extreme,
    they find a parallel play in Belle &amp; Sebastian's <em>The Life Pursuit</em>, co-opting glammier beats to service their fussy,
    handcrafted pop-rock without succumbing to a loosey goosey sexuality that would be a poor fit.  Even those accustomed to Sloan's effortlessness will find the
    first half of <em>Parallel Play</em>
    almost flawless.  There's still little in
    the way of artifice or innovation, but it's still easy to admire the
    architecture-- while the hammering shuffle of ""Believe in Me"" builds to an ecstatic,
    positive chorus, it careens right into ""Cheap Champagne"", which reverses course
    by downplaying the clever minor progression in hooks in favor of the ""ba ba's""
    that start it off.  But beyond those two,
    Sloan never feel the need to come on too strong, as ""All I Am Is All You're
    Not"" gets its hands muddy before striking oil on the hook and ""Witch's Wand""
    disguises its subtly dark lyrics about female mind control (or possibly heroin,
    but I doubt it) behind the head-bopping melodies.  
    </p>
<p>
    But then again, there's an issue here that's not really
    Sloan's fault, per se-- as with most bands who traffic in this sort of
    retro-minded AM fixation, they always have to skirt the temptation of being too
    academic. No band should get
    docked points for making things sound too easy, but when they try to stretch
    out into a more psychedelic format with the uneasy melody of ""The Dogs"" and wiggly
    wah-wah on ""The Other Side"", things drag on quite a bit-- these are songs Kula
    Shaker could probably write in their sleep. 
    </p>
<p>
    Which isn't true of the mission statement of ""Down in the
    Basement"", a surprisingly personal (and Dylan-aping) retelling of what matters
    most to Sloan at this point-- staring down their forties, but unfortunately reprised with a cloying, generic lyric on
    ""I'm Not a Kid Anymore"".  Simultaneously
    evidencing hope, doubt, and perseverity, it's an endearing mission statement, and with power-pop generally falling into the clutches of edgeless pantywaists like Fountains of Wayne, it's refreshing to
    hear one of its finest practitioners see it as a cause worth fighting for.

<em>After Hours</em> rolls in, alt-country flags flying: opener ""Fossilized"" boasts some two-chord strum and pick, a rutted-road rhythm, honky-tonk ivories, even the thick thud of cowbell. And in his lugubrious
    baritone, Dave Shuford-- the man behind the D. Charles Speer curtain-- lays out a
    litany of boilerplate woes: broken relationship, stalled career, the general suckiness of
    growing older and an inch closer to feeling obsolete. From a six-Buds-to-the-wind perspective, he tells a woman who used to come to his shows
    but doesn't anymore: ""These days I see you'd rather be set on fire/ Than to be
    a part of the attending choir/ But I don't really mind"".</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    These genre markers, however, are posted on what turns out
    to be a garden path. Two verses in, guitars whinny, drums stumble, and amps froth
    at the mouth, as ""Fossilized"" spasms seizure-style, and Shuford and
    backing band the Helix collectively lose their shit in a brief psychedelic breakdown.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Limning the country/psych membrane isn't a particularly
    novel strategy, of course. From the cross-pollinating Byrds, Creedence
    Clearwater Revival, and adjacent artistic circles of the 1960s and 70s, to the cowpunk and
    psychobilly scenes of the 80s and 90s, to today's robust indie-country landscape, the curious crossroads of backwoods and inner eye always seems to draw its share of pilgrims. Many of the hybrid's recent strains-- gothic Americana,
    in particular-- offer willfully weird, self-conscious genre-bending
    performances that verge on camp. But on their second record after 2007's more
    folk-identified <em>Some Forgotten Country</em>, Speer and the Helix take a page from the
    past and play it straight up. Kind of. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<em>After Hours'</em> bounty of drinking songs for
    down-and-outers-- ""Drink Up and Go Home"", the title track, and the
    band's cover of Gary Stewart's desolate ""Single Again""-- proclaims
    its genuine, irony-free affection for twang and scant patience for artifice. When damp creeps through <em>After Hours'</em> floorboards and stuff on the walls slips askew, they come off as reasonably organic developments. The
    droning-veering-into-abstract ""Sit Right There"" imagines the Greek
    bouzoukis as a historically accurate fixture of the Appalachian folk tradition. ""Canaanite Builder"" is convincingly fire-and-brimstone, as Shuford drawls jumbled Old Testament verse and draws vivid grotesquerie (shrunken heads, severed feet) to menacing, heavy-bottomed grooves. ""Past or Beyond"" is a
    schizophrenic style parade of whiplashed time signature shifts that hints at band members' avant-garde backstories in taxonomizing-resistant acts No Neck Blues Band and Sunburned Hand of the Man. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But even when it shares more with No Wave than <em>No Depression</em>,
    <em>After Hours</em> makes you think that maybe the odd stuff was buried in the ancient
    songs all along. And here's where the ""old, weird America""
    is typically invoked. Nine times out of 10, the phrase Greil Marcus made famous
    is utterly inapplicable. However, D. Charles Speer's hidden-in-plain-sight
    aesthetic, its facility for making the familiar strange (and deserving of
    closer scrutiny) is exactly what Marcus was on about when he pointed in wonder at ""the
    mystical body of the republic, a kind of public secret...a declaration of a
    weird but clearly recognizable America within the America of the exercise of
    institutional majoritarian power."" So shine a light, lift a rock:
    this weird secret deserves to be known. <span> </span><span> </span>

After all, though 2005's <em>Contact Kid </em>was wracked with twee Beat Happening aspirations, their 2006 follow-up was, if not better produced, at least more sweeping in scope. Taking their arch, druggy songs to the dancefloor on <em>Music for Plants</em>, they seemed to find their footing with minor-key new wave flourishes and electronic textures, embracing their more computerized impulses so as to match the winking artificiality of their droll, acid-friend lyrics. But now, on their fifth effort, they seem to have given up on the guitar altogether.</p><p>
    Well, maybe not <em>altogether</em>-- Rob Corradetti's axe does turn up on most of the 11 tracks on <em>Let's Be Friends</em>, but it always sounds like an afterthought buried in the mix below videogame bleeps and bloops. His guitar melodies either sound like lackadaisical throwaways, as if he is simply noodling absentmindedly under buzzing keyboards, or they are used for brief bursts of feedback and fuzz to aid in the synthesized feel of these wannabe-8-bit songs. It is not coincidence, then, that the album's finest moment is its least electronic. In fact, ""Sinking Feeling"" isn't just this record's best song, but is also, hands-down, the best Mixel Pixel song yet. Its squishy drum machine rhythms add a propulsive heartbeat underneath the guitar's almost-folk vamp, and though Corradetti is singing in unison with Kaia Wong, this song makes wonderful use of the dissonance between his handsome, dusky delivery and her sweet, babyish coo.</p><p>
    But ""Sinking Feeling"" aside, most of <em>Let's Be Friends</em> sounds like it was made on a crappy vintage Casio, lazily using the machine’s pre-programmed beats as its foundation. That kind of sparse lap-pop can work, but without catchy vocal hooks to lure listeners in or clever lyrics to keep them attentive, it simply sounds hollow. And sadly, these songs too often feel like excuses for Corradetti and/or Wong to wryly speak-sing hipster shout-outs to their Converse and getting high. When the too-clever or downright silly lyrics are swathed in less barebones synth arrangements, as on the blatant Magnetic Fields homage ""Cats"", they are less grating or noticeable; the listener can just ignore them and enjoy the sticky-candy melody and astral computerized effects. But those moments are few and far between.</p><p>
    Perhaps what's missing here is a lyrical innocence to match the amateurish synthesizer melodies. After all, if the words were as faux-naïve as the music (or artwork) here suggests, maybe it would read as an overall aesthetic choice, instead of a musical limitation. Mixel Pixel are right to wade in electro textures, but, right now, they aren't quite comfortable enough yet to submerge themselves, so this synth-heavy collection finds them, unfortunately, a little out of their depth.   <br/></p></div>"|11574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11574-lets-be-friends/|4.9|Rebecca Raber

If the buzz sends you to MySpace, you'll     get their impact but not their dynamics. Catch one of their cramped     live shows and you'll get their in-it-to-win-it intensity but not their     expansiveness. Hear their self-released EP, and you're     getting closer-- besides existing at the cross-section of so many     styles, the disc finds the band at a more important nexus of potential     and     realization. In person, Crystal Antlers     look like outcasts from six different bands, and at various points on     this record, they sound like it, too: Merging psych, garage, lo-fi,     prog, and countless other influences, the group easily     maintains     consistency despite a complete inability to be pinned to any specific     movement or trend (so long as you're not counting the increasingly     frustrating trend of unimaginative bandnames).</p>
<p>You might come across comparisons to Les Savy Fav, an appropriate call if you     consider it shorthand for ""relentlessly energetic band with crowd-pleasing     stage antics.""  <i>EP</i>'s     opener ""A Thousand Eyes"" is evidence enough of that: Beginning with     doomy, lo-fi minor arpeggios, it soon     explodes into a Latin-influenced rumble before the band piledrives into     a     swaggering psych hook, the track sounds something like if Comets on     Fire inverted their ratio of chaos-to-craft. Beneath the squall, ""Vexation""'s headsnapping pace and flesh-searing bass riff could be a Stooges-style punk shoutalong.  The organ     riff that ""Owl"" pogos on is a found relic from late-1960s Venice     Beach with a monolithic vocal melody.  And like any long-haired throwback worth its bongos,     <i>EP</i> ends with the loosest and longest     number, the seven-minute swamp lurch of ""Parting Song for the Torn Sky"".</p>
<p>As much as it diverges from the brain-frying     aim of typical psych-rock outings, <i>EP </i>is an unorthodox summer record-- not so     much for driving to the beach as actually being in its sweltering grasp, equal     parts scorched earth and wide open spaces.      Credit to producer Ikey Owens (aka Mars Volta's keyboardist-- there's hope!) for finding     enough room for every instrument, few of which act in their traditional     scope.  If you find yourself humming     any of the riffs, odds are they'll come from singer Jonny Bell, who treats his bass like a six-string while guitar (check the     appropriate titanic ""Arcturus"") and organ provide shading under an ozone of reverb     that, like early My Morning Jacket, gives an impression of an expansive     soundworld the band can grow into.</p>
<p>It's tempting to be patient and call     this disc a stopgap on the way to a triumphant debut full-length.  But <i>EP </i>is plenty substantial as is; at 25 minutes, it's only a few shy of <i>Nouns</i> or, more to the point, any number     of psych-rock classics from decades past. Of course, if you're still waiting on further evidence of how much there is to like about these guys, consider that I waited until the end of this review to mention that their percussionist is named Sexual Chocolate.</p></div>"|11580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11580-ep/|8.5|Ian Cohen

Arguments against reactionary ideologies such as rockism<em> </em>often hang upon accusations of social prejudice, which certainly can be a component of it. But there's a more empathetic and equally plausible explanation: It's not that new music is inferior to old music (although the feeling often gets twisted this way), but that older music's obsolescence can make us uncomfortably aware that the same thing could, and likely will, happen to much of what we listen to today.</p><p>
    Being trapped in this relentless forward momentum, with losses stacking up behind us, perhaps explains why, as popular music moves ever forward, the individuals creating it tend to move backwards. Punks eventually try their hand at country, indie rockers get into classic rock, and Adem, aka the guy from Fridge who isn't Four Tet, puts aside post-rock and neo-folk long enough to record <em>Takes</em>, a largely acoustic album of unpretentious covers rendered more emotionally than cerebrally.</p><p>
<em>Takes</em> mainly consists of Adem's charismatic voice and deft acoustic guitar, although a kitchen sink's worth of embellishments, from vibraphone to dulcimer to autoharp, flesh it out. It has a heavy nostalgia component, as all of the covered songs were originally released between 1991 and 2001, Adem's self-professed formative years. This lends it a backwards-looking, ""120 Minutes"" vibe, and bolsters its sense of longing regression. You can tell from Adem's earnest renditions that what he's singing here is less a collection of covers than a specific, intensely personal vision of his life. His evident love of his source material and the material's alternative-era continuity make <em>Takes</em> a vanity project that's much better and more universally appealing than what we usually mean by the term.
    </p><p>
    Adem renders his source material in a homogeneous style, so that it actually sounds like a bona fide album whose rewards aren't contingent upon familiarity with the covered songs. For anyone who was young in the 90s, however, familiarity will augment its appeal. The best part of <em>Takes </em>is Adem's song choices, which tend to be surprising even when the artist choices are not. The feeling of burgeoning recognition is so pleasurable that I'd advise listening to the album before you read the track list, or the rest of this review. It's a lot of fun to listen to a lyrical, hammer-on intensive acoustic melody with a sense of near-maddening familiarity until a certain lyric makes you realize that you're listening to Smashing Pumpkins B-side ""Starla"", spliced with a bit of <em>Gish</em>'s ""Window Paine"".
    </p>
<p>
    This splicing speaks to Adem's infectious, fanboy enthusiasm in constructing this album, which reportedly came about because fans frequently ask him for recordings of the solo covers he plays live. When he couldn't settle on just one track from a beloved artist, he simply hybridized two. So a loping, easygoing version of Bedhead's ""Bedside Table"" mingles with a bit of ""The End of the Day"", and Aphex Twin's ""To Cure a Weakling Child"" and ""Boy/Girl Song"" get wrapped up in one twittering, bell-laden folk number. (Yes, Adem not only transcribed Aphex Twin songs for acoustic guitar, but he did a great job of it-- its gentle, upsweeping chorus is an album highlight.)
    </p>
<p>
    Plus, he's got a nice voice, and a nice voice is crucial for this material. It's just rough-edged enough to sound ""alternative,"" but versatile enough to assimilate Björk's gulpy murmur (on a hovering version of ""Unravel""), PJ Harvey's gruff purr (on an ornately finger-picked ""Oh My Lover""), and Yo La Tengo's laundry-fresh harmonies (on a weary yet oddly uplifting ""Tears Are in Your Eyes""). Mix in some Lisa Germano (""Slide""), Pinback (""Loro""), Breeders (""Invisible Man""), and Tortoise (a pretty but negligible ""Gamera""-- the instrumental doesn't quite suit this vocal-centric album), and you've got a veritable '90s nostalgia-bomb on your hands. And maybe it's at least accidentally significant, as regards the desire to stop time and preserve lost innocence, that the most recent cover was released in 2001, right before a few hijacked airplanes set in motion a chain of events that would make life more complicated and perilous for most everyone.

Finnish collective Paavoharju are obstinate in their attempts to buck this trend, scattering Europop, pastel electronics, and woolen drones like a tossed deck of Bicycle playing cards. The greatest achievement of Paavoharju's <em>Laulu Laakson Kukista</em>, though, is not its dexterous balance of song and sound but the way it invests you as heavily in field recordings, dub workouts, and quasi-classical think pieces as in the band's foreign-language hookmaking.</p><p>
    Ostensibly a ""songs"" album, <em>Laulu</em> only gradually reveals their scarcity: count six using the standard ""Could I maybe put this on a mixtape for my coworkers if, in fact, my coworkers were into entropic Nordic dance-pop?"" benchmark. In place of half of a classic pop album, <em>Laulu</em> doesn't redefine out-music so much as find clever and inventive ways to incorporate it. Like its predecessor-- Paavoharju's 2005 debut <em>Yhä Hämärää</em>-- <em>Laulu</em> opens with ""Pimeänkarkelo"", a track that ceases to be an ""intro"" around the two minute mark and carries on for twice that anyway, ultimately serving as a palate cleanser for the surprisingly tart headrush of ""Kevätrumpu"". Kinetic synths and lovingly cheesed-out drums bleat and whir like dancin' music at a 1992 rollerblade disco. A stressed, sexed female voice coos and circles and punches like she's got Madonna's biceps but not those under-eye bags. And then...variations on a plinky piano melody in the form of ""Tuoksu Tarttuu Meihin"", which mulls and ponders amid a static curtain. When the band later remembers the melody on the album's two shortest tracks they feel less like interludes and more like rounding back to an earlier conversation after a thorough and fulfilling detour.</p><p>
    Downtempo dub. Song. Weird pastel electronica. Song. <em>Laulu</em> is structured much like <em>Yhä Hämärää</em> and the line between should be drawn using confidence, or perhaps perseverance. Mulish is too ugly a word for <em>Laulu</em>, whose compositions are stubbornly given room to flower and expand but are always appropriately reined; instead let's say that Paavoharju have a well-developed internal clock, or are otherwise familiar with ""The Ugly Duckling"". ""Kirkonväki"" outgrows its watery piano and malfunctioning click-track to blossom into a goth-rock prom, replete with organs in waltz-time stumble. ""Uskallan"" features a male lead so clear-throated and dramatic that the song sounds like one of the early 90s Latin-American hits that increasingly populate Chicago's jukeboxes. ""Sumuvirsi"", a rhythm-less, female-led hymn whose second-most prominent sound is a cackling raven, hues closest to the psych-folk traditional to Fonal's roster, but even it seems more theatrical and dramatic, like Paavoharju have been taking their cues both from Eleanoora Rosenholm and high-school drama productions.
    </p><p>
    The tiny honking synths that augment the rusty guitars of ""Tyttö Tanssii"" suggest a more literal reading of the Bicycle metaphor from above: a hill of two-wheelers, disheveled rubber, tassels, and bells. <em>Laulu</em> connotes this youth, motion, and playfulness in various states of repair and construction, and it does so by alternating well-formed, multi-faced pop songs with abstract head-scratchers, each component as warmly evocative and strangely necessary as the last.

For his day job, Drake works in marketing for the hip-hop label Def Jux, and he brings his business acumen to the presentation of his own work. After spending the last two years on a stream of remixes (of Midlake, Asobi Seksu, Aesop Rock, and many others), last December he released a free download-only covers EP called <em>One Alternative</em>, whose artwork and song selection (tunes by Pavement, Liz Phair, Sebadoh) were meant to inspire nostalgia in the generation that came of age in the post-Nirvana era. But while Drake has had some moderate success marrying the organic and glossy with the odd remix or cover, <em>Small-Time Machine</em>-- a seven-song, 30-minute album that feels much longer-- meets with more difficulty.</p><p>
    Comparisons have been made between Cassettes Won't Listen and electro-pop outfits like the Postal Service and the Notwist, but neither rings true. Unlike the Postal Service's Ben Gibbard, who had the luxury of laying his gut-punch turns of phrase over Jimmy Tamborello's lunar soundscapes, Drake is working alone and with less sonic imagination. Without the lyrical muscle of Gibbard (or one-time Tamborello associate Conor Oberst), his electronic backdrops don't have the color or edge to distinguish themselves. But the album's most striking weakness can't be chalked up to any shortage of hooky beat construction or bad poetry; rather, it's Drake's inability-- unlike, say, the Notwist's Markus Acher-- to integrate his often scratchy, Doug Martsch-biting vocals as an instrument into the mix.</p><p>
    To live with songs by a one-man band is to be alone with that man and his thoughts, so it's best if he can either invite you in or transport you elsewhere. With so much glitchy, bad CGI-like synth scramble in the way, <em>Small-Time Machine</em> becomes an unfortunate push-and-pull between equally hyperprocessed elements. Which leaves us in kind of a bind, because as much as <em>Small-Time Machine</em> feels like kitchen sinking gone awry, there are a few moments of pop transcendence, most notably at the album's halfway mark. After a rough initial stretch that includes the more abrasive chug and scrape of ""Large Radio"" and single ""Paper Float"", Drake opens up his vocal chords a bit and bounces up off the ropes with what could be the album's centerpiece. ""Freeze and Explode"" boasts blindfolded guitar lines that snake in and out of a chorus that Drake not only sings but drives home with a clarity sorely missing from the rest of the record.
    </p><p>
    It's sort of weird to think about someone like Ben Gibbard casting such an imposing shadow over Pentium rock. But just seconds after the aforementioned track closes, one more highlight in the lilting but clubby ""The Broadcast"" presents itself, if only because it bears the most palpable resemblance to Death Cab for Cutie. Which is totally cool, but it also makes that copy of the Postal Service's <em>Give Up</em> seem all the more appetizing right about now.

    Well, here's one you don't read every day around these parts:
    RIYL Keller Williams, Howie Day.  Like
    eating Dippin' Dots or watching ""The Jetsons"", listening to the Israeli-born
    Yoav's debut is akin to experiencing yesterday's future today, in this case, the
    one-man band running his guitar through a looping delay pedal.  But while previous progenitors of this form
    have come from a singer-songwriter/jam band background, Yoav's hook is that he's
    a student of dance music, as much of a Björk as a Buckley.  And this approach has the potential for
    admirable results, since it's probably xenophobic and certainly factually
    incorrect to say that acoustic guitars and repetitive structure aren't
    conducive to body moving.  But at the
    center of <em>Charmed &amp; Strange </em>is
    one giant miscalculation-- Yoav is trying to approximate <em>American </em>club music, to become, in his words, a ""one-man Timbaland
    band,"" a hubristic claim that's almost charmingly naïve, considering even Timbo
    needs an extra pair of (Danja) handz these days.  Regardless of how good this could possibly sound
    in theory, in practice <em>Charmed &amp;
    Strange </em>rarely amounts to something much different from that jagweed at
    your local college watering hole covering ""SexyBack"" because he thinks it's a
    total laugh riot.</p><p>
    For all of the melting-pot promise, <em>Charmed &amp; Strange  </em>feels
    more like the worst of all worlds summit of songwriter weakness-- Jose
    Gonzalez's tendency towards sonic similarity without the skill and delicacy, ""Punk'd""
    Justin Timberlake without SNL Justin Timberlake, Dave Matthews' leering
    lasciviousness without...well, you get the idea.  Blame a flawed business plan; no matter how
    many layers of simulated keyboards or percussion he slathers on, Yoav sounds
    completely alone at all times; like the acoustic cover of ""Boyz In The Hood"", a
    tenuous show of genuine love is inevitably overshadowed by having no real
    investment in physical place.</p><p>
    Which brings Yoav's voice to the forefront and with it, a
    subtle twist of obnoxiousness in its sharp falsetto and ""Mark E. Smith in da club""
    inflections.  ""You'll be nuttin' but a
    club thing/ What would you say to be paid, to be one of the beautiful?""  ""Adore, adore/ Kneel down before""-- such is
    typical of Yoav's lyrical mien, which would be embarrassing enough in its own
    right, but it's exponentially worse in context of tracks that bear more in
    common with <em>Nebraska</em><em> </em>than Ibiza; like
    so many other facets of <em>Strange &amp;
    Charmed</em>, Yoav earnestly builds with the wrong set of tools.
    </p>
<p>
    Or chalk it up to him yoking this record to one of the worst
    guitar sounds I've heard in some time, ridding the acoustics of all natural
    luster and range for the sort of cheap slapback delay familiar to anyone who's
    purchased a multi-effects processor under serious budget constraints.  At least on ""Adore Adore"", he manages a sort
    of Kraut-ish trance similar to Iron &amp; Wine's ""On Your Wings"", but Yoav
    breaks any sense of placidity with his overwrought accusations.  Meanwhile, ""One By One"" is typical of the
    record's balance, songs that take too long to screw its way deeper into
    quicksand.  It hints at
    propulsion, but never takes off because it could really use <em>real </em>drums, not a thumping approximation
    of them.  With both indie and dance
    embracing a wider range of textures than ever, what sense does it make to limit
    yourself so severely?  
    </p>
<p>
<em>Charmed &amp; Strange </em>ends
    with a predictably curious cover of ""Where Is My Mind,"" and needless to say,
    it's no ""$20"".  But even if you thought
    M.I.A.'s version was genius or merely tacky Pazz &amp; Jop bait, it shows the comparative
    failure of Yoav's approach, which ignores that interdependence is a more
    advanced social relation than independence. 
    Even though Maya has an unquestionably individual vision, she has enough
    confidence to seek out the strengths of others to help her achieve it, whether
    it's outside collaborators, producers, or samples.  Yoav goes about his expecting some sort of
    kneejerk praise for rolling dolo, but thanks to a total lack of depth, sonic or
    otherwise, all I see is the gimmicks, the wack lyrics.  Shit is depressing.

    There's really no twist with <em>Robert Pollard Is Off to Business</em>, which maybe qualifies it as the greatest twist Pollard's pulled off in his post-GBV career. Composed of 10 songs clocking in at an average of three-and-a-half minutes each, <em>Business </em>showcases Pollard at his most conventional since, well, probably ever. He's also never leaned so heavily on long-time producer/multi-instrumentalist Todd Tobias, whose lush, expansive arrangements make <em>Business </em>sound shockingly MOR, especially coming from the king of tape hiss. Yet despite what sounds on paper like an over-the-hill artist throwing in the towel and finally sounding his age, <em>Business </em>only further attests to Pollard's unique abilities.</p><p>
    Always one to seek pop bliss from the most seemingly unpalatable places, Pollard approaches his classic rock influences on their own terms here. While 1970s power pop, arena rock, and MOR bands have always flavored his canon, he's never interpreted them as literally as he does on these meaty numbers. Whereas Pollard's previous album (<em>Superman Was a Rocker</em>, released just a few moons ago) saw him retooling old instrumental tracks, <em>Business </em>basically retools his record recollection. Just listen to how the stutter-stepping acoustic guitar of opener ""The Original Heart"" cops Led Zep's <em>Houses of the Holy</em> opener ""The Song Remains the Same"", or the acoustic pop charm of Big Star clones ""The Blondes"" and ""Wealth and Hell-Being"".</p><p>
    Just as the lo-fi vs. hi-fi debate has always been pretty fruitless with earlier material, Pollard's super hi-fi sound on <em>Business </em>isn't any more the story here than the suddenly slick production was on, say, 1996's professional-sounding <em>Under the Bushes Under the Stars</em>. ""Gratification to Concrete"" may feature a wah-wah guitar effect set to ""Frampton"", but ultimately it's muscular pop that can be learned in forty bucks worth of guitar lessons. Despite regal strings and an Eastern-tinged guitar, ""To the Path!"" isn't trying to match ""Kashmir""'s bombast, especially when a proudly disjointed riff deflates the track's dramatic heightening. In case you're still concerned Pollard's gone heavy-handed on us, there's also loads of brainy power pop (""1 Years Old"" being a highlight) and an ugly acoustic ballad titled ""Confessions of a Teenage Jerk-Off"".
    </p>
<p>
    Although <em>Business </em>ultimately ranks as yet another less-than-legendary offering from a living indie legend, its shortcomings are much more nuanced than typical Pollard releases. Not one track here merits swift deletion; Pollard packs too many ideas and sections into each one to render any completely unredeemable. The obvious drawback, though, is a relatively sluggish pace, especially on a grungey number like ""No One But I"" or closer ""Wealth and Hell-Being""'s neverending outro. Still, Pollard embraces his rock icons at their most overblown here, and, despite his canon stretching around the world, <em>Business </em>manages to sound like something we haven't quite heard before on previous Pollard albums.

    Supergrass aren't young anymore (by their own scale, of course; they're, ahem, in their early thirties), and they've reached a stage when they can recall and relive what it was like to be kids.  Back to 1994, to be specific, when the trio emerged as gleefully stonerific teenage moppets who turned down Steven Spielberg's offer to make them into the new Monkees, then brilliantly named their underrated second album <em>We're in It for the Money</em>.   Instead of taking the (dubious) quick-fame route, the band opted for the more conventional approach: issuing variations on its identifiable brand of
    good-natured, druggy, arena-sized bubble-glam over the next 13 years and four albums, and establishing itself as one
    of the most dependable and popular purveyors of outsize British
    pop-rock (in the UK, that is; in the U.S., they've topped
    out at #195). They're back to<em> </em>their hijinks again on <em>Diamond Hoo Ha</em>, but from the perspective of, well, a band which opens for the Foo Fighters in basketball arenas.</p><p>
    Though much of <em>Hoo Ha</em> returns to chronicling the same sort of
    less-than-legal lifestyle that made ""Caught by the Fuzz"" such an
    invigorating attention-getter at the height of the Britpop moment, the underlying sentiments have mellowed as Supergrass have grown up, something easily visible by glancing through the band's catalog.  In 1994, a 17-year-old Gaz Coombes
    fretted from the back of a paddywagon about what his mum and older
    brother would do when they discovered he been busted for blow; on <em>Hoo Ha</em>'s
    expansive ""When I Needed You"", Coombes is ""in the back of a stolen car,
    going 80 with the headlights off"" (metaphorically, I'm assuming-- he's
    a rich adult now), while pining for a less-specific form of guidance.
    Later, a sordid nightclub visit leads to what reads like
    post-infidelity guilt on ""345"", and even the album's most insatiable
    pop bangers, ""Rebel in You"" and ""Ghost of a Friend"" are swathed in
    personal nostalgia, celebrating excess and temperance at the same time.</p><p>
    Supergrass worked with producer Nick Launay-- who helmed the last three Bad Seeds albums-- to grime things up a bit, and <em>Hoo Ha</em>'s first two songs (and singles) ""Diamond Hoo Ha Man"" and ""Bad Blood"", showcase a harder yet still familiar image of the group.   The blurry, drug-fueled debauchery and dirty riff-rock is more Queens of the Stone Age than Bolan and Bowie, and plenty vampiric: The title character is some sort of dealer/door-to-door salesman with an afterhours work schedule including seedy hotels, whose business card reads:  ""When the sun goes down/ I can't resist"", then ""Bite me!""  The shady ""Rough Knuckles"" protagonist also holes up at by-the-night residences, but in the chorus, Coombes, never one to wallow, drags him out into the light and sets him up as an ""outlaw on the run.""  It should be an appropriate costume for the band to wear, but it's still the case that Supergrass is at its best when making streetlit skulking into <em>A Hard Day's Night</em> instead of taking a stab at <em>Trainspotting</em>.</p><p>
    The triumphal ode ""The Return of..."" is bait, of course, Supergrass telling us in no uncertain terms that they're back to their old tricks again.  The verses, a slight nod to end-is-nigh politics and bullying of the more interpersonal sort, march past militaristically, but when the chorus switches meter and turns woozy, the hint is more than received that the source of inspiration is more than likely still the band's own Hoo Ha Man.  Similarly, ""Whiskey &amp; Green Tea"", about a post-festival night out in Beijing, aims to be a lost in translation free-for-all, but plays more as an enthusiastically told blurry tourist tale.  
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe ""Whiskey""'s the key to why <em>Diamond Hoo Ha</em> doesn't register as the satisfying return-to-form it tries so hard to be: stories about getting fucked up do often get less interesting as the tellers get older.  It's that, but also that their sonic schtick wears a little thin here.  Supergrass's Original Variations on <em>Electric Warrior</em>-- their pitch-perfect admixture of boogie-based power-pop and spacy rumination-- is still wonderful to revisit, but their attempt to reinvigorate it on this record is like the dirty, partially-satisfying buzz you get from smoking that roach you found under the car floormat.  I'm assuming they didn't mean for the name of the album to register as ironic as <em>In it for the Money</em> or <em>Road to Rouen</em>, but <em>Diamond Hoo Ha</em> does seem like an apt description of the glittery nonsense contained within.

    The second most charming thing about dance-rock duo Shy Child and their
    obsession with rhythm is that it's never entirely clear where they're
    taking their cues from-- like, does first single ""Drop the Phone"" sound
    more like recent Timbaland or one of the early singles from the
    Strokes? The most charming thing is that they don't sound like they
    care very much: who else would try to ride to fame on a piece of
    syncopated synthetic new wave skiffle singing about, literally,
    dropping a phone (as far as I can tell anyway)? But ""Drop the Phone"",
    as with most of Shy Child's third album <em>Noise Won't Stop</em>, is deeply lovable in spite of, or perhaps because of these unanswerable questions.</p><p>
    ""Drop the Phone"" lays out the basic brief of Shy Child's sound:
    burbling, whining synthesizers occupying the roles of both rhythm and
    lead guitar, urgent-sounding multi-tracked vocals (falling into the
    categories of ""rather yelping"" and ""very yelping"") that sound like
    they're being recorded into several megaphones in the next room, and
    cavernous, clattering drums that do their best to crowd everything else
    off stage, including the performances of singer Pete Cafarella.</p><p>
    Cafarella's caffeinated performances survive and even benefit from
    this struggle for attention, partly because he can operate only in the
    registers of excited and extremely excited, and partly because his
    songs were never meant to be the focus anyway. While Shy Child are
    confined to tight, catchy verse-chorus structures, it's the song's
    status as a <em>structure </em>that
    makes it useful-- a structure around which to festoon an absurdly
    generous array of rhythmic ideas, and a parade of dazzling hook after
    dazzling hook.
    </p>
<p>
    Cafarella
    and fellow member Nate Smith have judged correctly: it's when Shy
    Child's grip on songcraft grows extremely tenuous that their music
    becomes interesting, even thrilling: from the schizophrenic ""Generation
    Y (We Got It)"" (imagine Junior Senior making Caribbean pop) to the
    overblown glam-stomp of ""Astronaut"" (keyboard vamps and counter-rhythms
    and overlapping vocal parts careening around like a wobbling, top-heavy
    spinning top), Shy Child's best work uses the pop song form as a
    grocery list for their favorite musical tricks rather than as a
    self-contained entity-- you can almost hear their childlike glee when
    they realize they can get away with a pompous Genesis-style keyboard
    solo on ""Astronaut"" if they briefly pretend they're actually Wolfmother
    (note: thankfully they don't sound at all like Wolfmother).
    </p>
<p>
<em>Noise Won't Stop </em>doesn't feel like it has noticeably weak
    tracks, but there are certainly moments when Shy Child sound less
    remarkable, less worthy of distinction-- usually when they focus on
    trying to make proper songs after all. I'm sure that the propulsive
    sprint of ""Summer"" will be the favorite of many listeners: with its
    vaguely allusive (although perhaps just vague) tale of a final youthful
    whine of intransigence before subsiding into conformity, it's probably
    the song that best presents the duo as a full package, and even
    suggests they might have ""something to say"". But it's also the least
    interesting thing here, its stripped-back, pounding groove attack
    evoking images of college kids getting their minds blown by Trans Am's <em>Futureworld</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    Conversely, <em>Noise Won't Stop</em>'s
    best moment is the unabashed trance-pop of album closer ""Cause and
    Effect"", which reminds me curiously of ""Don't Give Up"", Bryan Adams'
    millennial trance-pop collaboration with Chicane. Here, the group's
    maximalist synthesizer pyrotechnics are exploited to a ridiculous
    extent, morphing from DJ Sammy-style atmospheric arpeggios through acid
    house bleeping and finally settling into the woozy warp speed churn of
    goa trance, sort of. Where ""Don't Give Up""<em> </em>seemed to achieve its
    yearning soar a little too easily (soaring being the natural state of
    trance-pop), ""Cause and Effect"" benefits from the friction between the
    music's effortless lift-off and Cafarella's grounded call and response
    chanting. It's probably the best rock song <em>and </em>the best trance
    song I've heard this year, and as a side-benefit shows up just how
    myopic the usual conceptions of ""dance-rock"" can be-- almost the first
    thought that ran through my head was ""why hasn't someone tried this
    before?""
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps
    it's simply that no other band working in this area seems so blissfully
    unconcerned about touching on the right reference points-- at least,
    not without a carefully arranged smirk already in place. In their
    faux-naif openness, Shy Child are perhaps closer to Swedish dance-pop
    duo the Tough Alliance than to anyone else, to the point that at first
    I was disappointed that <em>Noise Won't Stop </em>wasn't
    more sweet, more romantic, more fey-- more, in short, like the Tough
    Alliance themselves. What sets Shy Child apart is their residual
    muscularity, even masculinity: as surprising and inventive and
    occasionally cheesy as they are, they inhabit an iron-grip tension,
    alert and wide-eyed and on a hair-trigger at all times-- if the Tough
    Alliance sound effortless, Shy Child see dance music as something like
    an athletic training ground. Maybe this is why so many of their songs
    seem to be about the power of their own grooves (just see the
    song titles: ""Kick Drum"", ""The Volume"", ""Noise Won't Stop"")-- it's as if
    they're expending an immense amount of energy in wringing these sounds
    from their machines, and they can't afford to divert their attention by
    singing about anything else.
    </p>
<p>
    I
    suspect that this masculinity is Shy Child's secret weapon. For all the
    dance-rock we've enjoyed and suffered through these last few years,
    there's precious few examples of bands being able to express their
    sweaty rock principles <em>through </em>(as
    opposed to alongside or even against) their dancefloor rhythms. For Shy
    Child, immersion in non-stop rhythm is just about the most ""rock"" thing
    they can do.

At almost-50, his elder statesman status feels earned, and the aloof whiff of philosophy in his music is softened by his hands-on, exploratory touch. He's never been afraid to reinvent techno and its tools for his own devices. The remixes on which he made his name involved his own specially modified turntables and records, with shapes actually etched into the vinyl, and on his last album, <em>Klick Revolution</em>, he imagined minimal techno as a cicada language that makes Ellen Allien's <em>Sool</em> sound like M83 by comparison.</p><p>
<em>When Horses Die</em> is a techno-singer/songwriter album reminiscent of Matthew Dear's <em>Asa Breed</em>, but where Dear's electronic cabaret was mostly bright and fizzy, Brinkmann's is riveted in jet-black steel. Its intellectual content is literally literary, with the same surrealistic bent he betrayed in naming his label Max Ernst: Its title comes from a poem by Russian Futurist Velimir Khlebnikov, and while Brinkmann penned the lyrics for three tracks himself, most of them are appropriated from the likes of American land artist Robert Smithson (of ""Spiral Jetty"" fame), Tuxedomoon's Winston Tong, and Russian poets Joseph Brodsky and Marina Zwetajewa. The dominant themes are love and devotion, although rendered in Brinkmann's gravelly, drawling baritone, devotion's seamy underbelly-- a dark, helpless thrall-- comes into the open.</p><p>
    This is especially apparent on <em>When Horses Die</em>'s first three tracks, which are its most striking-- their glacial tempos and staggering weights seems to freeze the clock's hands as Brinkmann's voice echoes down, seemingly from somewhere far away and long ago. ""Words"" consists of a few glowing notes of piano in a slush of carefully controlled feedback, and Brinkmann's vocal somehow manages to be both spectral and anvil-heavy. This thick atmosphere continues through ""Spiral"" and ""Birth &amp; Death"": The former is a steam-hissing meditation built on a wrap-around synth tone, while the latter is an industrial march whose Teutonic rigidity makes for a good segue into the album's other mode.
    </p><p>
    I'm torn on this second mode: The contrast is welcome, but the idea of an entire album with the pace and gravity of the first three tracks is seductive. At any rate, an affinity beyond Dear (and how did I get this far without mentioning Suicide?) crops up in the album's midsection: namely, Trent Reznor, who is thanked in the album's liner notes, and whom Brinkmann told <em>XLR8R </em>was a big influence for <em>When Horses Die</em> (along with Joy Division and Stina Nordenstam). Beginning with ""Meadow"", time speeds up like a Guy Ritchie film trick, and Brinkmann embarks across a midtempo pop-industrial landscape rich with precisely graphed percussion, spongey synths, and low-flying bass. It's well-turned and enjoyable, but seems a bit mundane next to the otherworldly dirges, a mode that returns, briefly, on the mirage-like ""Uselessness"", and on closing track ""40"", which reprises the opening track's ethereal piano. It's jarring to go down a rabbit hole, only to find yourself suddenly shunted into the swarming, lively anthill of the album's midsection, but maybe that's precisely Brinkmann's angle-- like an expert hypnotist, he knows how to snap us back to reality just before we get too deep.

What begins as a potentially go-nowhere dirge erupts into a brief out-of-the-past acid-rock freakout, the maxed out guitars mingling uneasily with strings and woodwinds, not to mention singer Gillian Chadwick's deceptively pure voice. As the album progresses, you keep waiting for a similar outburst of fuzz guitar frenzy, but it never really arrives, at least not with such fervor. More often than not, the disc sticks to vaguely Eastern mysticism and medieval witchy-pooisms, a mix of incense and Ouija boards, delivered with total sincerity and off the charts portentousness.</p><p>
    ""There's a force behind me, more powerful than you think,"" intones Chadwick in ""Clouds? Or Smoke?"". She's aiming for menace, but as far as stuff meant to spook you into submission goes, Ex Reverie is pretty mellow, neither particularly mean nor mysterious, and bogged down with flowery lyrical flourishes, like late-night notebook musings unleashed. They're actually perfectly suited to the mostly languid prog-folk songs, which themselves favor trancelike drifting over intricate assaults.</p><p>
    It must stink to have your heart in another time but to be stuck here in 2008, though <em>The Door Into Summer</em> is surprisingly light on tension, let alone the mild cognitive dissonance of anachronism. The Renaissance fair-ready ""Wooden Sword"", for example, is all the unintentionally funnier for its po-faced seriousness, while the swirling dress hippie pop of ""Days Away"" sounds stolen straight from some Haight-Ashbury vault.
    </p><p>
    Yet when Ex Reverie stumbles on something special-- a killer riff, or an interesting arrangement-- the group at least recognizes its potential. ""Dawn Comes For Us All"", for example, pushes forward on the back of an ultra-cool slo-mo Godzilla vs. Sabbath-styled churn, albeit one with more space stirred into the mix; the song's a cappella vocals and handclaps breakdown is an album highlight. Earlier, ""The Crowning"" sticks to its deliberate tempo and pace, making the intertwining guitar solos of its coda more effective.
    </p>
<p>
    As strong a recreation of another era-- let alone another dimension-- <em>The Door Into Summer</em> may strive to be, its effects never quite transcend its affections, and in the end, it's still a few pours short of a full flagon of mead. It's channeling way too hard, like a novice psychic nervous around her supervisor when all she needs to do is relax and let the spirits come.

He's lived up to his end of the bargain: A clear and wonderful upward trajectory can be easily mapped over the band's first decade, as their fanbase and creative scope expanded with the crowds and lineups at Bonnaroo, a festival with which they'll forever be linked.</p><p>As they grew, they pared back indulgences (like the thick song lengths of <em>It Still Moves</em>) and allowed fresh ideas to infiltrate (the first third of <em>Z</em>) while retaining a  sonic identity distinctive enough to influence legions of worthy followers. Their 2005 psych/prog wonder <em>Z</em>-- not so much their <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> as their <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>-- broke sharply with the Muscle Shoals might of <em>Moves</em>, but 2006's wonderful live double-album <em>Okonokos</em> re-framed and affirmed My Morning Jacket as what fans and critics had been saying since <em>At Dawn</em>: This is one of America's preeminent contemporary rock bands.</p><p>My Morning Jacket's latest album, <em>Evil Urges</em>, ends the mean streak the band's been on since 2000, and threatens to squander some of the widespread goodwill they've been steadily building along the way. There are few fiery guitar freakouts, folk-influenced melodies, soaring space-rock bridges, or psychedelic flourishes here; instead, the empty space is mostly filled with serviceable falsetto funk and glassy-eyed soft rock. Worse still is the band's decision to ignore the perfect past incarnations of James' Orbisonian tenor-- easily MMJ's most appealing component and one of the more breathtaking instruments in modern rock.  At best, his voice is sorely underutilized here; at worst, it's mangled beyond recognition.  After listening to <em>Urges</em>, I wonder if My Morning Jacket might just be satisfied following in the footsteps of labelmates Dave Matthews Band: nestling into a comfortable niche and aiming for the Starbucks carousel with rootsy New Age romanticism.</p>
<p>Any discussion of this record has to start with the eye-poppingly annoying ""Highly Suspicious"", a loud thud ending any chance <em>Urges</em> had to match the group's previous records. An attempt to merge the band's penchant for live quirkiness with James' long-simmering Prince fixation, the track sounds like My Morning Jacket's version of a Phish novelty. The song reduces James' voice to a grating squeak, which cowers in the presence of the obnoxious, caricatured chorus. Its libertarian undertones (""Wasting all your time on drama/ Could be solving real crime"") sound like they could stretch to resonate with the hydroponic crowd or those who fret about warrantless wiretapping, but I cringe thinking of an entire amphitheatre singing along to ""peanut-butter pudding surprise"" unless they're at a Ween show.</p>
<p>At the moment, even a not-very-political band like My Morning Jacket can't resist using their biggest stage yet for a bit of message-driven oratory. James has said, ""<em>Evil</em> <em>Urges</em> is about how all of these things that you've been told are evil really aren't, unless they're actually hurting something or somebody."" Cool, but the title track, a lighter version of ""Suspicious"", neuters a righteous sentiment by burying it underneath a jammy funk pastiche.  The simultaneously effortless and calculated ""I'm Amazed"" is breezy and naïve enough to trigger the unconscious sing-along reflex, but the refrain (""Where's the justice?"") is ambiguous. Similarly, ""Look at You"" wastes a perfectly good pedal-steel on a goofy hybrid of the sensual and civic, praising ""a fine citizen"" as ""such a glowing example of peace and glory,"" as if James were a state senator awarding citations to volunteers. ""Sec Walkin'""s refrain of ""demon eyes are watchin' everywhere"" may address his existential angst at omnipresent security, but the song's Quaalude-smooth soul vibe-- for real, it's a Grover Washington sax solo away from the PA system at Von Maur-- make it seem more like he's content to just keep on truckin'.</p>
<p>Soft rock isn't an irredeemable genre category, and there are some pretty good singles that have been tagged with it.  James and his band have professed their affection for such sensitivity in the past, on tracks like ""I Will Sing You Songs,"" which successfully filtered a timid emotional tone within the band's own style.  Not so much here. In a live context, prefaced with an extended ironic monologue, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgUWNeewXjE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Make It With You</strong></a>"" is fun.  On record, several times over, from a singer more accustomed to disguising his elliptical, oft-nonsensical lyrics with grain-silos full of reverb, it's incongruous and awkward.  ""Thank You Too!"", with syrupy strings courtesy of arranger-to-the-stars David Campbell, is readymade for the bride and groom's slow dance (save the line ""you really brought out the naked part"").  The strings trill, dramatically rising and falling on the loner's fantasy ""Librarian"", as James quietly crushes on, and quietly stalks, the female behind the desk, turned on by her listening to ""Karen of the Carpenters"" on AM radio.  It sounds like a very well-produced Dan Fogelberg song, until James drops ""interweb"" on us like a sack of dirty socks.  Thankfully, there's no couplet about him texting her on his ""Crackberry"" lol.<br><br> Still, James' tender side also leads to <em>Urges</em>' best moments, which bookend the album.  Nicely sequenced after the title track at the start of the record, ""Touch Me I'm Going to Scream, Pt. 1"" is the perfect sequel to <em>Z</em>'s sly ""It Beats 4 U"", down to the songs' similarly insistent, live/synthetic drum patter, and the way they isolate James' voice in a chilly emotional purgatory, only to be cracked with passion: ""I need a human by my side, untied"" is vulnerability done right.  James is smart enough to know when he's got something good, and he ends <em>Urges</em> with an eight-and-a-half minute dark disco reprise of ""Touch Me"", slowly taking shape as the solemn, steady ""Smokin' From Shootin'"" fades out.  With its patient, synthetic gleam slithering around James' lusty hoodoo, ""Touch Me, Pt. 2"" is My Morning Jacket's Moroder moment, bringing a highly frustrating record to a close with the line ""Oh, this feeling is wonderful/ Don't turn it off.""  If it hadn't been such an exhausting ride to get there, I might not want to.</br></br></p></div>"|11585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11585-evil-urges/|4.7|Eric Harvey

What would it include? Long, rangy dub basslines, undoubtedly. Twinkling snatches of suggestive melody, maybe. Certainly a couple of vocal samples, drifting in and out of tracks like happy mental flotsam. And then... the big-lunged diva on top of it all, delivering the group's message of positive empowerment through song? Wait a minute-- something's wrong there. As you wake up suddenly, your early 1990s reverie is shattered by the affectless gospel stylings of that anonymous singer. You fold your tie-dyes away, kick your beanbag into a corner, disconnect your VR goggles, and ask, ""Orb, where did it all go wrong?""</p><p>
    The Orb have presented <em>The Dream</em> as a return to both form and freedom. On the one hand, they cut loose from the deadening expectations of record labels and made it themselves; on the other, they've promised the fans a return to the cosmic roamings of <em>Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld</em> and <em>UFOrb</em>. Dr Alex Paterson is reunited with Youth and Steve Hillage, and longtime collaborator Thomas Fehlmann-- whose commitment to a drier kind of ambience helped lose much of their once-huge fanbase-- is absent. If happy, hippie times were ever coming back, this would be the moment. It isn't, and the out-of-place vocal shenanigans are only part of the reason why.</p><p>
    They are a <em>big</em> part, though. On the comical ""Vuja De"", a vocalist shouts ""It's the way you hold me!"" On ""A Beautiful Day"" she informs us ""Sunshine ain't no rain."" On ""The Truth Is..."" we learn ""only truth will set you free."" And so on. The problem isn't really lyrical banality, though, it's that the presence of vocals fixes the songs into a pop structure which works against the band's more diffuse strengths. And the nature of the vocals-- declamatory deep-house singing-- is an unwelcome injection of extroversion into music that's better suited to mind's-eye visions. </p><p>
    Even beyond the vocals, the Orb's ability to construct a track seems shot to hell. The group in its heyday made drug music, undeniably, but like the best drug music it didn't just enhance the chemical experience, it explained it for non-users. Orb records prepared a generation of students for what being stoned felt like, largely because they unfolded so enticingly, those gradually shifting basslines underpinning a procession of ideas and samples linked as much by whimsy as logic.  </p><p>
    The basslines are still here, but where the band might once have fed in one or two edge-of-brain voices and teased out their trippy potential, <em>The Dream</em> is filled with babble. The record samples a heap of stray voices, drawn from sources either hackneyed (radio preachers and politicians) or simply dull (instruction manuals). Even the tracks without singing sound cramped and busy, and the ugly metallic drum sounds the Orb use don't help. Compare these pieces to their Kompakt work and you can't help but suspect that Fehlmann brought useful compositional discipline to the group, even if he did dampen the band's ever-suspect sense of humor. </p><p>
    It may seem unfair to constantly hold <em>The Dream</em> up against music the Orb made more than 15 years ago, but that's the yardstick, and the style, the band is clearly aiming for. And towards the end of the record, they do at least locate the target. ""High Noon"" mixes delicate piano fragments with the kind of dub bubblebath that made the group's name, while ""Codes"" lifts sounds from the band's own ""Blue Room"" and works as a nostalgic ramble around some familiar space-scapes. It's all very pleasant, and so is ""Orbisonia""'s closing drift, but even here Paterson's touch with a vocal sample is more wayward and intrusive than it used to be. Ultimately, this particular dream is less one of flight or past glories, and more one of going to work and finding you've forgotten your trousers.</p></div>"|11592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11592-the-dream/|3.6|Tom Ewing

    Albums as abstract as Christopher Bissonnette's <em>In Between Words </em>are practically engraved invitations to wax impressionistic, and I admit to filling my notes with unfortunate similes such as ""ascending long-tones stacked like an obsidian ziggurat"" and references to the shadow of something winged and terrible and impossibly immense passing overhead. That images like these could apply to most dark ambient records limits their usefulness, except to say that this album satisfies a fundamental criterion of good abstract music: It lights up the imagination.</p><p>
    More specifically, <em>In Between Words </em>is both calming and unsettling, very familiar and very strange, because Bissonnette is essentially turning the familiar Romantic-era music of the 19th and early-20th centuries inside-out. This isn't Bissonnette's innovation-- titans like Morton Feldman paved the way-- yet the effect is especially pronounced on <em>In Between Words</em>. To test this idea, get your hands on a piece of Romantic music: Something dark and gusty and depressive that trembles exhaustedly on the cusp of Modernism will work best. Jean Sibelius' <em>Symphony No. </em><em>4 in</em><em> A Minor</em> is really rad and perfect to illustrate this point.</p><p>
    Listen to the string parts for awhile. First, you'll notice the soul-wrenching melodies and the stories they tell. Then, you'll hear the quiet, somnolent rumble all around them. This balance of fluent melody and brooding atmosphere is part of why Romantic music was so good at the 360-view-of-human-experience thing: Like the great Russian novels of the same era, it combined rabid conviction with searing doubt. Its melodies told stories of human striving and collective belief, but its disquieting sub-tones hinted at the existential uncertainty at the fringes of these stories, which would come to dominate Modernism. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>In Between Words </em>flips the Romantic dichotomy on its head, pulling the sub-tones to the surface and burying the remnants of narrative. ""Provenance"" begins with a desolate expanse of what sounds like stringed resonance with the actual melody edited out, as if someone had stripped away every narrative agent from a Sibelius symphony until only the murky hum at its root remained. When a discernible string melody appears, it's distended, distant, and wracked with electrical interference. Similarly, ""Orffyreus Wheel"" (note the tellingly corrupted mythological reference in the title) finds what sounds like a flanged guitar melody trying to articulate itself through a calm but obliterative gale. ""A Touch of Heartbreak"" sets hollowed-out ghost voices in a blank, seething field, gradually whiting out into hushed static, and ""Tempest"" sounds like a carillon (a shortcut to religious ecstasy in Romantic music) being dragged awkwardly over craggy terrain. 
    </p>
<p>
    The stories these compositions tell are not about mythology, or heroism, or even misery and ruin. In fact, they're not stories at all. Instead, they're elegies for the grand meta-narratives that guided high Romanticism, which were approached skeptically by Modernism and hostilely  by Postmodernism. Bissonnette is firmly in the latter camp: Right there in the album's deconstruction-redolent title, he lets us know that he's most interested in what's unsaid. Luckily, he's an eloquent un-sayer, and his music is elevated beyond the cerebral by a palpable longing for a time when meaning wasn't regarded such a chimerical, capricious thing.

    Within the past month and a half, two songs from Chicago electro-pop duo Walter Meego's full-length debut, <em>Voyager</em>, have appeared on the hit ABC dramedy ""Ugly Betty"".
    The show's title protagonist is young and unprepossessing, but gains
    confidence and command as her story unfolds. However unwittingly, <em>Voyager</em>
    mimics this evolution, initially presenting a pair of facile,
    derivative popsmiths who seem to perceptibly mature into dynamic
    artists in the short space between the record's beginning and end.</p><p>
    Opening with the <em>Betty</em>-featured
    ""Forever"", Walter Meego emerges at first as merely an especially blithe
    practitioner of the kind of affected, heavily beholden synth-pop that's
    been particularly trendy of late thanks in part to the legitimately
    great retro stylings of Cut Copy. Faintly cloying where Cut Copy is
    cool, Walter Meego's initial efforts here are fun but almost
    obnoxiously lightweight, as the admittedly enjoyable ringing synths of
    ""Wanna Be a Star"" and cheeseball guitar riffs of ""Girls"" nonetheless
    edge towards the irritatingly shiny territory of simple-minded
    labelmate Calvin Harris.</p><p>
    Starting
    with ""Tomorrowland"", however, Walter Meego begins to round into shape,
    teasing out a distinct Beatles influence (specifically evoking ""Across
    the Universe"") that subtly but nicely distinguishes the group from some
    of its more rigorously 1980s-entrenched brethren. That paisley pastiche
    is followed by the distinctly off-putting ""Keyhole""-- only in the case
    of Walter Meego ""off-putting"" is a refreshing descriptor given how
    baldly easy it was to swallow the album's first few tracks. A distant
    cousin to Radiohead's ""Climbing Up the Walls"", ""Keyhole"" puts hazily
    distorted vocals, creeping piano, and double-time drums towards
    obliterating memory of the playskool pop that marked <em>Voyager</em>'s first act.
    </p>
<p>
    The
    tracks that follow ""Keyhole"" only strengthen the impression that Walter
    Meego deliberately frontloaded their record with hummable banalities in
    order to earn the privilege of going darker and deeper over its second
    half. The fat grooves and layered effects of ""Lost"" suggest the group
    may have a higher ceiling than ""ideal Hot Chip opening act,"" while the
    fantastic contrast between precise, hard-hitting beats and pillow-soft
    vocals on the succeeding ""Letting Go"" makes you disbelieve this could
    really be the same act that sounded like a lobotomized synth-pop
    Fountains of Wayne on ""Girls"" just five tracks earlier. Not only is the
    music suddenly more dense and interesting, but singer Justin Sconza's
    vocals are noticeably more compelling and commanding as well.
    </p>
<p>
    Walter Meego has one more quick-change trick up its sleeve, as following the innocuous ""Baby Please"" they close <em>Voyager</em>
    with a pair of dreamily anaesthetized floaters, a predictable comedown
    perhaps but an impressive show of pacing and structure from a group
    that initially threatened to churn out a record of unmediated retro
    tack. Much as America Ferrera, the bespectacled, braces-burdened star of ""Ugly Betty"", is actually a stone fox in real life, so too does Walter Meego offer up more than you'd first assume.

    This usually isn't something
    readers (or writers) take into account when it comes to this site's reviews,
    but you might want to consider that rating up there a purely vestigial
    placeholder this time around. A 5.0-- basically 2.5/5 stars-- is essentially ""not good,
    but not awful,"" which is an evaluation that kept coming to mind on the first
    few listens to this debut from the Stones Throw intern-turned-roster member.
    But it's also supposed to mean ""mediocre""-- and nothing this willfully odd can
    really be considered mediocre. <em>Welcome </em>is a one-man show that
    emphasizes the DIY basement-band side to synthesizer funk, that rides hooks and
    grooves so relentlessly that they transmute from catchy to grating to hypnotic,
    that draws from Prince and Sly Stone and Beck and Pharrell Williams but
    amplifies the stuff that made them eccentrics well over the stuff that made
    them pop. Take Pants' labelmate, the notorious borderline-outsider artist Gary
    Wilson, replace lounge-jazz with 1980s r&amp;b, remove the thematic obsessions over mystery girls and phrases like ""bitch"" and ""chrome,"" and you've got a start. A damn weird
    start.</p><p>
    Chances are that this album will
    alienate the shit out of you quite a bit before you start catching on to its
    fucked-up charm, and you might even give up before you get to that point. There's
    something kind of obvious and silly about the sounds on this record,
    particularly the synths, which seem to be chosen specifically for how dated
    they sound. And few of these songs really get much further than the
    establishment of a catchy riff and a steady, heavy drumbeat (live or
    synthesized) with some wailing Moog noises and the odd half-shouted lyric laid
    over the top. There's actually a fair shot that you'll be horribly repelled by this
    music, much in the same way and for the same reasons a lot of people seem to
    have this seething, boiling hatred for ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!""</p><p>
    But it's hard to actually
    consider <em>Welcome </em>a <em>bad </em>album, mostly because it has this
    inexplicable likability: It's bizarrely comic without coming across as cheap irony,
    and it's pretty clear Pants lays down these semi-instrumental jams because he
    wants to have fun and make noise with some once-expensive, now-dated (and,
    subsequently, currently underheard) musical machinery. It helps when he has someone else
    along for the ride-- like Deon Davis, who contributes silky-smooth vocals to
    two of the tracks, including the wobbly Holiday Inn soul harmonies of offbeat
    debut single ""Ka$h"", or 70s/80s electro-funk obscurity Gary Davis, who
    co-produces the affably dopey but backbone-slipping ""You're the One"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Yet even on his own, James
    Pants is capable of laying down some jams when he wants to: for every
    afterthought-sounding Casio-demo-button-gone-wrong semicomposition like ""My
    Tree"" or inebriated, rhythmically hinky roller-boogie botch job like ""I Choose
    You"", there's a song that puts weirdness to its advantage: Opener ""Theme From
    Paris"" sounds legitimately exciting in its overenthusiasm, all thundering drums
    and seething synthesizers like a 13-year-old John Bonham pitted against the
    soundtrack to Sega's arcade classic ""OutRun"", and the damaged on-the-fly
    rapping of ""We're Through"" has the same low-budget naifish whimsy as some of
    the better stuff from the similarly Prince-minded indie-electro goofs in Sexual
    Harassment. 
    </p>
<p>
    I can't unreservedly call
    this album good-- yet-- but I can definitely recommend that you listen to it,
    because there's not much out there that really sounds like it, and for every
    moment where you think its sheer whacked-out sloppiness is going to give you a
    headache, it delivers a flash or two of giddy brilliance. You know why this gets a
    5.0? Because I can't give it a picture of Roger Troutman giving a flying elbow
    drop to the animatronic gorilla from the Rock-afire Explosion band.

    rock and folk history, but they never play to their record collection. Rather
    than revive a particular scene or re-create a lost sound, the Seattle quintet
    cherrypick their ideas from a broad spectrum of styles, pulling in Appalachian
    folk, classic rock, AM country, and SoCal pop to create a personal synthesis of
    the music of their peers, their parents, and even their grandparents.</p><p>
    The band didn't leave town to record <em>Fleet Foxes</em>, yet it sounds like it could have been recorded anywhere in the United States-- Austin, Minneapolis, Chicago, Brooklyn, Louisville, or more likely some clearing in the woods. That placelessness constitutes an active effacement, considering that Seattle has been a locus for alternative music for nearly two decades. The five-piece is thoroughly embedded in that scene: Their ranks include current and former members of Crystal Skulls, Pedro the Lion, and Seldom. Furthermore, to produce the sessions that created the <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/48881-sun-giant-ep""><strong><em>Sun Giant</em> EP</strong></a> and this debut LP, they hired Phil Ek, best known for his work with Modest Mouse, Built to Spill, and the Shins.
    Nevertheless, theirs is a studiously rural aesthetic, eschewing urban influences and using reverb like sepia-tone to suggest something much older and more rustic than it really is. The album opens with a short tune (titled ""Red Squirrel"" on early leaks but not listed on the CD) that could be a field recording sung by a small-town congregation 50 years ago. It ushers us into Fleet Foxes' old world; after a few bars, the song darts into the heraldic ""Sun It Rises"", which sure enough sounds like someone's idea of a sunrise over an evergreen mountain. But they're not done yet: Just as the song fades, it rises into a quiet coda that previews two more elements of their sound-- the patient guitar lick on ""Blue Ridge Mountains"" and the vocal harmonies that color numerous songs on the record. All that's missing are the crackles and hisses of an old LP. (Fortunately, Sub Pop is issuing it on vinyl.)</p><p>
    What follows is surprisingly full and wide ranging, almost
    as much as the Bruegel painting that graces the album's cover. Skye Skjelset's guitar
    roams wherever it pleases, while drummer Nicholas Peterson keeps the songs in
    check, allowing the band to move freely but not wander too far into the woods. A
    flute, half-submerged in the mix, adds lurking menace to the album's most intense jam, ""Your
    Protector"", and Casey Wescott's staccato piano
    rhythm runs through ""Blue Ridge Mountains"", heightening the momentum of the
    chorus.
    </p><p>
    For all the album's winding paths and unexpected vistas, Fleet
    Foxes' harmonies remain the primary draw, and they've written and arranged
    these songs to showcase their shared vocals. ""Heard Them Stirring"" has no
    lyrics, but it's hard to call it an instrumental. Against a
    shuffling shaker-and-tambourine rhythm, ""Ragged Wood"" switches between Robin
    Pecknold's lead vocals and the band's harmonies after each verse, effectively
    translating classic rock via folk elements. There's as much Fleetwood Mac as the Band in the song's rousing finale. On the other hand, Fleet Foxes do restraint
    just as well: ""Tiger Mountain Peasant Song"" features only a lone acoustic guitar and Pecknold's forceful vocals, which switch to a spooky falsetto on the outro. 
    </p>
<p>
    Vocals play such a primary role in Fleet Foxes' music that
    Pecknold's lyrics at times sound like merely a delivery system for harmonies,
    with references to meadowlarks, rising suns, and streams
    bolstering the rural and placeless evocations. However, these are ultimately
    carefully and well-crafted compositions. On ""White Winter Hymnal"", a firelit
    roundelay that best showcases the band's vocal interplay, the lyrics convey
    strange, almost Edward Gorey-like imagery: ""I was following the pack/ All
    swallowed in their coats/ With scarves of red tied 'round their throats/ To
    keep their little heads from falling in the snow/ And I turned 'round and
    there you go."" Who knows exactly what the words mean, but the fairy-tale menace
    comes through in full color, and Peterson's floor-tom beat and the intricacy of
    the band's harmonies dispel the threat without diluting the mystery.
    </p>
<em>Fleet Foxes</em> ends with ""Oliver James"", another nearly a
    cappella showcase for Pecknold's solo vocals. As he thumps out a soft rhythm on
    his Martin acoustic, he sings about handmade tables and long-gone grandparents,
    howling the chorus ""Oliver James, washed in the rain/ No longer."" The brief snippet of ""Red Squirrel"" and ""Sun It Rises"" invites you into Fleet
    Foxes' debut, but ""Oliver James"" doesn't shoo you out the door. Instead, Fleet
    Foxes let you linger for a few more bars, leaning forward
    to catch Pecknold's last syllable as it fades into the air. They don't seem to want the record to end any more than you will.</div>"|11587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11587-fleet-foxes/|9.0|Stephen M. Deusner

Jeremiah Wright, of Chicago. Those months have also seen a fairly warm critical reception for Erykah Badu's terrific new album-- one whose notions and ideologies sometimes come from the same nexus as Wright's. Badu's theology is different, of course: more personal, more scattered, less Christian, laced with Five-Percenter notions. And Badu salutes Farrakhan explicitly, rather than just nodding politely across the South Side. But there's an odd echo in her wording on that one: ""I salute you, Farrakhan/ <em>Because you are me</em>."" Less than a month after this record's release, Wright's most notable acquaintance was describing the reverend as someone who ""contains within him the contradictions-- the good and the bad-- of the community.... I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community."" <em>He is me</em>? Until he hits the press club, anyway.</p><p>
<em>New Amerykah </em>is the first in a series of pointedly social records from Badu, and ""you are me""-- or maybe <em>we are</em> <em>we</em>-- could be its motto, or possibly its intended effect. I don't bring up politics for nothing. That attitude, and a lot of the record's concerns, have their roots in the same era that animates Rev. Wright-- those Civil Rights and post-Civil Rights moments when African-Americans were left with some strange, heavy tasks: sorting out how to have a cultural identity as part of a nation that had, up until very recently, been a dedicated adversary, and sorting out how to clean up the wreckage that had accumulated in the meantime. A lot of the critical love for <em>New Amerykah</em> seems rooted in a love for the music of that period-- a time in which popular black artists made records filled not only with visionary, avant-garde sounds, but with a social expansiveness, a fire and ambition to say something important to and for a community. Reviews put this record in a line with those artists: Sly Stone, Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, Stevie Wonder, Funkadelic; you could tie it even more easily to a lot of smart-guy late-80s hip-hop digging into the same ideas. Nobody who's been paying attention will be surprised at the thought of that mantle being picked up by a woman.</p><p>
    This album doesn't just have the personal and social ambitions of those old records-- plenty of charmless ""nu-soul"" records aspire to that-- but some of the sonic ones, too. Big tracks aside, it's an awfully <em>static </em>record, which gives it the kind of high-art ""difficulty"" that we critics have been known to like. The beats, by hip-hop producers like Madlib, 9th Wonder, and Shafiq Husayn, trail sneakily by, leaving Badu-- without the aid of verses, choruses, or much structure at all-- to scribble all over them in her perfect/imperfect voice. (One track, ""My People"", is mostly just a repeated mantra; the rest of Badu's vocal scribbling is buried far back in the mix, like an incidental decoration.) These things should pose problems; one of the chief wonders of <em>New Amerykah</em> is that they don't. Instead, they allow for a sense of intimacy and freedom. At the end of one already-great track, there's an offhand doodle that's one of the most amazing pieces of music I've heard all year: It's just Badu, with some chatter in the background, singing her mother's history in unison with a muted trumpet. But you can hear the two musicians working happily to stay in unison, all through a complex jazz run, even trying to match their vibratos; you can imagine the takes where they miss it and laugh a little. It makes a little joke, and it closes on a terrific line about her mother's resilience-- ""Even though it was hard, you would never ever know it""-- and in the end I can't think of a nobler use for recording equipment.</p><p>
    It's those personal moments that sell things, even more so than in Badu's back catalog; credit usually goes to her gift of a voice, which she uses impressionistically instead of composing, but it's always been her keen writing about <em>people </em>that gives her tracks much of their shape. The trumpet comes at the end of a track called ""Me"", which despite the title is more candid than narcissistic-- a gorgeous, sunny, soft-soul beat over which Badu sings about getting older, getting thicker, having two kids with different fathers. That candor is also a lot of what sells Badu's social concerns, which could otherwise sound like a laundry list of black-community struggles: poverty, urban violence, bad policing, AIDS, the psychological hard spot of teenage girls, complacency, and get-mine nihilism versus hope for something else. These things get filtered through Badu's head into real scenery instead of placeholders, and folded in among other things that seem remarkably sincere and personal: mourning for the late producer J Dilla, an earnest belief in hip-hop as a uniting culture, and that <em>we is we</em> attitude. Even the beats wind up feeling earnest. The bulk of them are dark, blunted, woozy, and paranoid; the exceptions are light, breezy, calm. But all of them feel like walking out onto an empty big-city sidewalk in the hours after sunrise, when everything's chilly, dewy, and strange.</p><p>
    There are times, as the album drags on, where that static darkness really does become a problem-- where the record begins to seem indulgent, half-finished, or slapped together. Part of the marvel of it, though, is how she still pulls this off, every bit of it, on sheer...Baduizm: Even when she seems wrong, or dippy, or maybe a little batty, she's still a ridiculously compelling and likable personality. This is something no one should criticize in music: recognizable, complex, three-dimensional <em>character</em>. Neither should we be too skeptical about people inclined to laud this as a strong new flash of old-style, socially engaged r&amp;b: Those ambitions are worth praising, and those eras worth looking back on, so long as it doesn't come along with the mean-spirited, bad-faith complaint that ""all"" of today's black music is ""just about guns/sex/money,"" or with this free-floating idea that the experiences of black people must always be treated as a socio-political ""issue"". Badu's difficult and complicated, and not even in a self-absorbed way-- it makes for good, deep records and shows that'll never start on time. (""Time is for white people,"" she recently joked to <em>Blender</em>, one-upping the old line about running on African Time.) I don't know if we're still voting for public policy based on who we'd rather have a beer with, but it occurs to me that I don't know many people who wouldn't love to grab a drink with Badu.</p></div>"|11562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11562-new-amerykah-part-one-4th-world-war/|7.8|Nitsuh Abebe

    The fusion of rap and heavy metal in the mid-1980s was as inevitable as it was initially novel, what with the premium both genres place on earthquaking drum beats and aggressive phallocentricism. But somewhere in the journey from ""Rock Box"" to Limp Bizkit, rap was effectively divorced from its true spiritual white-boy cousin-- punk rock, with which it shared roots in the underclass, modest, DIY means of production and a certain outspoken candor. It's a connection that wasn't lost on everybody-- most notably, the young Beastie Boys, but where the Beasties felt it was a prerequisite to drop their guitars in order to pass the mic, some 25 years later, the opening salvo from Baltimore's Death Set proffers another option for another rap-savvy punk-rockers: ""Listen to This Collision"".</p><p>
    For Death Set, the collision is not just musical-- hitching revved-up buzzsaw guitars to machine-gunned low-budget beats-- but demographic and, most notably, physical. Upon stumbling into their afternoon South by Southwest set last March, I was greeted with the sight of beardo indie-rock dudes and neon-hatted Spank Rock look-alikes bum-rushing the stage with equal gusto, while Death Setters Johnny Siera and Beau Velasco-- flanked by two drummers-- stood gleefully in the centre of the melee, as stage-diving bodies flew around them like storm debris. That the band are denizens of Dan Deacon's Wham City should come as no surprise, but a Death Set show presents a new utopia: Slam City.</p><p>
    Their debut disc, <em>Worldwide</em>, can't match that display for sheer visceral thrills-- its compact, lo-fi production inspires less of a pogo and more of a vigorous head-nod, and with 18 over-caffeinated tracks in 25 minutes, the album feels like a particularly sweet treat that passes through your system far too quickly. But as we approach the impending global oil crisis, the disc's unbridled enthusiasm presents itself as a viable alternative energy source. <em>Worldwide</em> adopts the ghetto-tech machination and chest-pumped posturing of early-80s rap, but-- in the words of a classic ""Mr. Show"" sketch-- without all that rap. Instead, the shout-it-out-loud exhortations of ""Intermission"" and ""Impossible""-- <em>Worldwide</em>'s surefire circle-pit instigators-- expose rapid-fire flows and punk-rock sloganeering as products of the same bratty insolence.
    </p>
<p>
    A great deal of Death Set's charm lies in how their toothsome double-guitar attack is deliberately undermined by their tinkertoy beats and new-waved keys; when the band try to overcompensate with the aggro, like on the robo-hardcore thrasher ""Day in the Wife"", they sound like they've arrived 10 years too late for the Atari Teenage Riot. But Siera and Velasco mostly know that, with their helium-high, munchkin voices, they're not going to fool anyone with a hardcore pose. Like Ween in their infancy, their band is really a vehicle to play out basement rock-star and gangsta fantasies-- <em>Worldwide</em> is littered with cheekily self-aware shout-outs to ""the muthafuckin' Death Set""-- but in their hearts of hearts, they're just a couple of softies: with endearing blitzkrieg-pop confections like ""Had a Bird"" and ""Selective Memories"", Death Set appear no more threatening than a couple of kids on Christmas morning waiting to unwrap the new, all-Superchunk edition of ""Guitar Hero"".

    We have a lot of fun rappin' with ya here at Pitchfork, but
    let's get serious for a moment: were the 1990s <em>really </em>that bad?  Maybe it's
    a sign I need to spend less time talking with other music writers, because the
    consensus appears to be an overwhelming, ""dear fucking god, TOTALLY.""  Maybe I'm just naïve, having exited the
    decade as a teen, but <em>Pinkerton</em>, the NHL
    92-96, <em>Higher Learning</em>...we had some good times, right?  It's within this context that I fear for
    Lemuria, even with a promising debut in tow. 
    Because their sales pitch can definitely double as a dealbreaker for
    some: This sounds just like 1993.</p><p>
    The Buffalo
    foursome may be playing it safe by aligning themselves with the likes of
    Superchunk and the Weakerthans, but I'm not buying it.  If you were old enough to watch MTV and buy
    CDs, but too young to realize that Belly and the Breeders actually started as
    spin-off acts, <em>Get Better </em>probably rules.  Indeed, Lemuria follow in the
    path of coy, mixed-sex acts of the alt-rock era, and nowhere is that more clear than in the vocals.   Sheena Ozzella and Alex Kerns have an
    inverse ratio of singing/songwriting, with Ozzella playing the Jenny Lewis role
    (clearly the lead, sweet and sour demeanor that skirts the ""girly"" tag) while Kerns
    is more of the Blake Sennett, sporting a slacker deadpan used far more rarely--
    good for song-by-song distinctiveness, not so much for harmonizing.</p><p>
    Still, you'll be surprised just how fun this can still
    sound-- ""Pants"" has a rambling melody that recalls ""In a Big Country"" over four
    DOD fuzz pedal chords.  But what comes
    across from ""Pants"" in particular is that many of these songs feel social and
    conversational.  And none really take
    themselves too seriously; ""Yesterday's Lunch"" plays around with the line ""it doesn't matter if
    you've succeeded"" before dropping the Morrissey punchline at the end ""...you'll
    never feel successful until all your friends fail.""  Elsewhere, the subjects are steadfast in their everyday mundanity, things like drunk boyfriends, the girl in the mirror, store clerks.    
    </p>
<p>
    But there's a reason you can go on Amazon.com with $20, buy
    back all of your <em>Buzz Bin</em> CDs, and still have change-- 75% of the time, you'd forget just about everything that happened from songs 7-10.  <em>Get Better </em>loses a lot of its fizz in its second half as the hooks
    become more indistinct; ""Dog"" and ""Dogs"" apparently
    are different songs, but the lack of any real segue makes it impossible to tell,
    and as a whole, they fall into to a spate of sub-two minute blurs that don't establish
    a welcome they can even wear out.
    </p>
<p>
    Plus, I'm not sure we're ready for a song built on a thrift
    store metaphor just yet and while Ozzella is clearly the breadwinner, at times
    she overdoes it-- to hear her yelp ""I'm missing you MORE THAN I'M KISSING YOU""
    is a bit...much.  Still, Lemuria have positioned themselves properly with an enjoyable if somewhat inconsistent debut
    that the world might not be as ready for as they may be in three years or so
    when they release their sophomore jam during a (probably inevitable) 90s
    revival.  By being slightly behind the
    times, Lemuria might just be ahead of the game.

    Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be a muse? It has to be a bit weird, right? You could be the reason why someone got over someone, or why people fall in or out of love. You could be an aphrodisiac or heart balm. Your story could define summers and winters. In the case of Okay's Marty Anderson, you might be the reason why he wrote <em>Huggable Dust</em>.</p><p>
    Much like <em>High Road</em> and <em>Low Road</em>, the twin debuts Anderson dropped in 2005, <em>Huggable Dust</em> is a shamelessly personal affair that succeeds as much because of Anderson's gift for pop atmospherics as his wide-swinging emotional outpourings. But while its predecessors toyed with questions and trapdoors of a more existential nature, <em>Huggable Dust</em> is focused on that which galvanizes, clouds, and tangles everything in between: love.</p><p>
    At 18 songs, there's a lot of sonic acreage to get acquainted with; the album's length cuts both ways, depending on how you feel about Anderson's singing and lyrics. Described in an earlier review by Pitchfork's Stephen M. Deusner as ""insectoid,"" Anderson's voice has a nasal, broken-sparrow quality that can be off-putting at times. But to my ears, it fits these songs well and works with his overall vision. His greatest talent is his ability to take small songs and make them huge, summoning out-of-nowhere climaxes as epic as the doodad-pop flourishes-- Xerox machines, Sega and R2-D2 effects galore-- are numerous. The resulting explosions tend to be both unexpected and breathtaking.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Panda"", likely a reference to Okay member Amanda Panda, is one of <em>Huggable Dust</em>'s best examples. What feels like very much like the plodding but pleasant acoustic pop strokes found throughout transforms to something totally different: an intergalactic mating dance in which Anderson pulls out every stop he can. ""Only"", a fingerpicked lullaby with a chord pattern not unlike Bright Eyes' ""First Day of My Life"", finds Anderson duetting to powerful effect with a female voice that emanates from an answering machine. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Huggable Dust</em> definitely seems to suffer from a lack of cohesion, with so many songs pulling in so many different emotional directions that it's difficult to enjoy at once. But when Anderson succeeds-- and he does often-- there's much to love as well. Late in the album, during what is it easily its most bruising ditty, he sings of white flags, of the song's title: truce. Whether or not the muse who might have inspired these songs is still part Anderson's life, she's certainly the lifeblood of the album. <br/>

In the U.S., the Prodigy were heralded as the bellwethers for electronica, while, in the face of this newly cobbled-together marketing schematic-- and exponentially rising sales of country and hip-hop-- Radiohead were charged by some with the task of ""saving"" rock music. Oddly, the two records seemed to have opposite effects. Throughout the late 1990s and early 00s, Thom Yorke practically functioned as a Warp publicist, embracing the possibilities and future of electronic music but retaining the charisma, scope, and grandeur of pop and, in the process, helping to expose rock fans to electronic textures and sounds. Meanwhile, the Prodigy-- along with Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, and Korn-- inadvertently spawned the well-selling mook rock.</p><p>
    Four years later, Radiohead had pushed too far in the ""wrong"" direction: The band's next two albums-- <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em>-- strayed far left of the organic and ""authentic"" (read: instruments carved from wood) for many of those same people who had exalted the group the previous decade. Critics faced with having to either step outside of their historical comfort zones and recalibrate their sensibilities or retreat back to the familiar took the easy road and embraced a New Rock Revolution that, in the U.S., never came to fruition. In the wake of it all, Radiohead themselves retreated from the spotlight, becoming the sort of arena-sized DIY band that, oddly, Pearl Jam morphed into during the previous decade, and eventually leaving their record label, Capitol, altogether.</p><p>
    Capitol's eventual response is, quite naturally, to collect the group's older material in a more pocket-sized package. To its credit, the label is going all-out with these releases, offering not only two different CD or digital versions of the set (a 17-track single disc or a 30-track 2xCD package), but also a 4xLP vinyl version that could be a nice addition to a fan's collection and pretty kickass DVD that even casual observers should love. Make no mistake then, the middling and low scores up there don't reflect a general dissatisfaction with the notion of carving up Radiohead's albums (though both the flow of <em>Kid A</em> and the tension of <em>Amnesiac</em> are masterstrokes of pacing), the very idea of career-spanning compilations, or even these records being compiled without the band's participation-- for one thing, avoiding the DVD on those grounds would be foolish. (And to be fair to Capitol, the label always seemed highly supportive of Radiohead, investing plenty of resources and marketing into their records-- especially <em>OK Computer</em> and <em>Kid A</em>.) No, it's much more utilitarian than that: Namely, for whom are these records meant?
    </p><p>
    The question is easier to answer for the single-disc version, which functions as a Radiohead sampler. A crisp, 17-track collection, it features the band's most well-liked singles, plus <em>Kid A</em> tracks ""Idioteque"", ""Everything in Its Right Place"", and ""Optimistic"" (remember, there were no singles pulled from that LP), plus the title track to <em>The Bends</em>. All told it's a murderer's row-- ""Paranoid Android"", ""Lucky"", ""Pyramid Song"", ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"", ""No Surprises"", ""Creep"", the aforementioned <em>Kid A</em> tracks, and many more. Only the sleepy ""High and Dry"" and requisite <em>Hail to the Thief</em> representative ""2+2=5"" are relative duds. If you've turned away from Radiohead this decade or if you aren't hooked by the more abstract pieces they've made since <em>OK Computer</em>, it's a good way to catch up. The tracks themselves are a 10, and if you're actually curious but unfamiliar with the group, by all means buy it. Yet even saying that, this isn't a band with a winding, difficult discography to navigate, and 10 of these 17 tracks are from <em>The Bends</em> and <em>OK Computer</em>. Assuming CDs exist in the near future, I suspect this compilation will become more useful in years to come, when younger listeners who haven't engaged with Radiohead throughout most of the group's lifetime want a place to sort out what the fuss is about. For the rest of us, it's just not needed.
    </p>
<p>
    The 2xCD version, although a better value-for-money, does even less to justify its existence. Starting rather cleverly with ""Airbag"" and ""I Might Be Wrong"", aka the two lead tracks from Capitol's in-print Radiohead mini-LPs (hint, hint), it goes on to add another seven tracks from the 1995-2003 albums (great songs, but most of them weaker than the ones on CD1), a pair of clunkers from 1993 debut <em>Pablo Honey</em>, and the only two things here that come close to being rare: The B-side ""Talk Show Host"" and the live acoustic solo Thom Yorke version of ""True Love Waits"" from the previously hinted-at <em>I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings</em>-- the only other time that song has appeared on record in any form. The packaging is merely a few promo photos and a long essay I didn't read (sorry). With little rhyme or reason to the songs that fill out this second disc, it becomes even more disappointing that a bonus isn't given over to an alternate view of the group-- B-sides or rarities, a collection which would be of great use, or their more adventurous work. Instead, this compilation is dominated by a pair of central ideas of what Radiohead sound like: emotionally nourishing, impressionistic balladeers, or crunchy, tech- and texture-savvy rockers. The outliers, moments when the band has dabbled more in mood, atmosphere, or a love of pure sound-- think ""Kid A"", ""Climbing Up the Walls"", or exquisite <em>Amnesiac</em> tracks like the clanging ""Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box"", the prescient paranoia of ""Life in a Glasshouse"", the unsettlingly gorgeous ""Like Spinning Plates"", or the punchdrunk ""You and Whose Army?""-- aren't represented at all. (Weirdly, I don't miss anything from <em>Hail to the Thief</em>, a collection of songs that works better live than on record.)
    </p>
<p>
    So, sure, artistically this could be a much stronger 2xCD set, but it's rightfully in Capitol's interest to spread the love and highlight all of the band's releases, each of which the label has a monetary stake in promoting. The latest Radiohead album, <em>In Rainbows</em>, is of course not one of them. Radiohead's decision to first self-release that record was heralded as an early warning sign that the major-label system was faltering. In truth, it's more of a <em>late</em> sign: With so little creative energy engaged in the hope and promise of making grand, heroic rock music-- and so few reliable, national delivery systems for it now that MTV and radio have become increasingly marginal-- the guitar set is still, incredibly, mostly left with warmed-over sounds from the 90s (on modern rock radio) or earlier (everyone else). It's no wonder that New Rock Revolution, itself mostly revivalism, had so many ardent cheerleaders.
    </p>
<p>
    Radiohead's purposeful retreat from the spotlight-- leaving Capitol Records; the patronage-like, ""we leak, you pay"" pricing policy that accompanied the announcement of <em>In Rainbows</em>-- returned them briefly to the headlines but did little to place their actual music in the public consciousness on any grand, communicative scale. (""Bodysnatchers"" was a semi-hit on modern rock radio.) Less than a decade after Radiohead invigorated critics and many listeners by becoming one of the few contemporary bands willing to both strive to reach a mass audience and cast its eyes to the corners and cracks of the pop landscape, they had become another niche group in a world full of them. What's more, the mechanics and poor health of the music industry-- with Radiohead, Trent Reznor, and others now experimenting with communicating directly to the faithful rather than to any and all potential listeners-- mean we may never see another platinum-selling rock group like this again. It's no surprise then that the music industry's response is to repackage and recycle, as quickly as possible.

Suffice to say that this website was a much smaller operation then, and there were far fewer writers; collectively, we also only had time for so much experimental electronic music. ""IDM"" as an idea still had plenty of currency, but many of the records falling under that banner were specialty items, something one would put on in a very specific time and place. And there were lots of them. In this landscape, when experimental electronic music was going in a hundred different directions at once-- considering only Gas' label, the Frankfurt imprint Mille Plateaux, you had the jagged sound of disrupted technology in Oval, the boldly politicized field recordings of Ultra Red, the filmic breakcore of Alec Empire, along with a smattering of post-rock and industrial-- Gas was something we could all agree on.</p><p>
    Wide appeal-- even amongst upstart music critics-- isn't something one would expect from this project. When working as Gas in the second half of the 1990s, Voigt's tracks usually featured an unflinching kick-drum pulsing at a mid-tempo BPM-- sometimes ping-ponging across the soundfield or encrusted with burrs of syncopation-- and they typically featured samples of stern and ominous Western classical music. The string and horn drones were sourced from vinyl and proud of it, with the corresponding pops and crackles figuring prominently in the mix. The Gas sound, so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, seemed somewhat monochrome and tightly focused at the time. It was easy to come away with the idea that the project was an exercise in Fall-like consistency-- ""Always different, always the same,"" as John Peel said about the latter. But it's clear now that each record was its own discrete chamber in Voigt's overall construction. The evidence is here, on this 4xCD box set, which collects the albums proper-- 1996's self-titled record, 1997's <em>Zauberberg</em>, 1999's <em>Königsforst</em>, and 2000's <em>Pop</em> (missing is the 1995 <em>Modern</em> EP as well as a couple of stray tracks)-- into a single set. These records have been out of print for years-- I saw a copy of <em>Zauberberg</em> going for $270 on Amazon not long ago-- but those refusing to pay outlandish prices have been handsomely rewarded. Gas in many ways sounds even more wondrous now, and certainly more wide-ranging.</p><p>
    The self-titled debut, originally released in 1996, is perhaps the most beautiful entry in the catalog. The rich, shimmery drones seem less earth-bound and heavy relative to what would come later; rather than evoking a dense, mossy arboreal feel-- Voigt has frequently acknowledged the sights and sounds of Germany's Black Forest as an inspiration-- <em>Gas</em> brings to mind images of a clear night sky, as pin-pricks of twinkling guitar samples, trails of distortion that swirl like a starry cloud dispersing into the void, and the bassy string tones all meet in a vast open space designed for contemplation. Though <em>Gas</em> is in some ways the most conventional of the project's records, with moments easily relatable to trends in post-acid house ambient, it also marks Voigt as a producer with a rare ear for texture.
    </p><p>
    The following year's <em>Zauberberg</em> was the solidification of quintessential Gas aesthetic. While overall the darkest and bleakest of these offerings, <em>Zauberberg</em> opens and closes with the deeply spiritual and uplifting organ drones one can imagine leaking from the cracked stained glass windows of a massive cathedral somewhere in the Bavarian Alps. Sandwiched between these drifting moments of blissful surrender are grim meditations on the physicality of tension. The bass drum throbs between the speakers, less a heartbeat than the icy, unremitting march of time, while Voigt's most dissonant string samples tug everything down into the black soil. It's a shopworn observation among Gas observers to say that the music on the individual albums closely mirrors the images record covers, but <em>Zauberberg</em> is as dark and menacing as the noir picture of red branches in darkness featured on its front.       
    </p>
<p>
    Beginning precisely where <em>Zauberberg</em> leaves off, with rumbling strings and an unblinking kick, <em>Königsforst</em> eventually takes things to a far more complicated place. Where Gas had previously been defined by the sense of endlessness-- insistent repetition, lengthy tracks that could conceivably go on forever, a consistent mood-- <em>Königsforst</em> experiments with development, moving through timbres and emotional sensations with a definable dramatic arc. The album looks back and forward simultaneously as Voigt seems to be probing the limits of what the project could be. The same starry backward guitar bit that first appeared on the third track of the debut returns on the fourth track here, now yoked to a subtle double-time kick-drum that gives a sense of blood-rushing excitement. Then the album culminates in the 15-minute fifth track, an Escher-like climb through samples of orchestral horns that change almost imperceptibly with each passing bar, moving from a firm, almost militaristic growl to welcoming, optimistic swoon by the track's end. The beatless drone that closes is another masterpiece, one that hints at massive left-turn to come on 2000's <em>Pop</em>; <em>Königsforst</em> on its own is essentially perfect. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Pop </em>is the best known and most admired of these discs, and it provides an obvious entry point. Which is somewhat ironic, since it's also the most divergent by a huge margin. Had it come out under another name, it would have been difficult to know that this was a Gas record at all. The first three tracks offer three subtly different views of the same sound-field, a warm, wet place populated with bubbles, fizz, and hisses, along with keyboard drones and the sort of basslines Angelo Badalamenti used in ""Twin Peaks"" to suggest a rural idyll whose dark secrets were yet to be revealed. Had the record continued to explore this one direction, it might have been understood as a contemporary variation on the new age meditation record, something listeners would return to in order to chill out and ""center"" and so on. But Voigt had something else in mind. By the fourth track he's returned the steady kick to the mix, and braided the percussion with a clanging repetitive bell that one imagines the Field's Axel Willner found inspiring. As the beats disappear for two tracks the album inflates with anxiety and dread until, with the return for the 15-minute closer, we're immersed in one of the most nervous-- bordering on malicious-- Gas tracks of all. 
    </p>
<p>
    By this point, it seems, Voigt had said what he wanted to say with Gas and was ready to move onto something else, like helping to turn the Kompakt label he runs with Michael Mayer and Jürgen Paape into one of electronic music's premier imprints. Four Gas albums in five years turned out to be quite a lot to chew on; this phase of his career is comparable to Brian Eno's instrumental music between, say, his 1973 collaboration with Robert Fripp, <em>No Pussyfooting</em>, and 1978's <em>Music for Airports</em>. More than anyone since Eno with the exception of Aphex Twin, Wolfgang Voigt was able to reimagine how ambient music could transform space. But he did so in a grounded, accessible manner. There's something primal and intuitive about this stuff; as heady electronic music goes, it's like a loaf of hearty dark bread, an easy-to-grasp but deceptively intricate musical world with a strong sense of-- to stretch the metaphor-- nourishment. Wolfgang Voigt's musical interests have led him to create stark dancefloor minimalism, playful house, and trance-inducing dub-techno; but Gas was the name he gave to music that was foremost about immersive space. This is music you can lose yourself in; see you in four or five hours.

    Covers albums ask you to set aside some of rock crit's
    most reliable qualitative barometers, songwriting and ""artistic
    growth,"" for a slightly different set of evaluative tools such as interpretative
    skill and aesthetic cohesion. But what most fans (and covers albums are
    primarily for fans) expect from a covers collection is a private tour of a
    band's basement: its nascent influences, personal touchstones, even its
    embarrassing fanboy crushes.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Vetiver, however, have never obscured their roots. Since the
    band's 2004 self-titled debut, Andy Cabic and his revolving lineup of players have
    camped at the various collision sites of rock, folk, psych, and country,
    combing through almost every inch of that frequently fertile soil. So its more
    weather than news that the band's latest LP, the accurately named <em>Thing of the Past</em>, digs exclusively in
    the crate marked ""1967-1973"", culling its covers from the catalogs of artists
    like Hawkwind, Townes Van Zandt, and Michael Hurley (the last appears on
    ""Blue Driver""). Anyone hoping Vetiver would pull a Richard Thompson and
    cover Britney is out of luck.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    There's very little on <em>Thing
    of the Past</em>-- released on Cabic and Devendra Banhart co-owned Gnomonsong-- to
    harsh anyone's mellow. Cabic's balmy tenor is as easy as ever on the ears, and
    its mild flavor is an actual advantage when called upon to shift from a <span> </span>supporting role in ""Sleep a Million Years""
    to the soft-rock lead in ""To Baby"". Until full-band jam ""Hurry
    on Sundown"" kicks up some modest dust eight tracks in, Vetiver hold heart
    rates in check with plenty of mid-tempos, acoustic instrumentation, and
    tasteful, gold soundz arrangements. The band also keeps interpretive liberties
    on a leash. Some of the album’s best cuts-- jaunty banjo ditty ""The
    Swimming Song"" and melancholy wallow ""Road to Ronderlin""-- are
    potent because they're time-tested, both virtual Xeroxes of, respectively,
    Loudon Wainwright III and Ian Matthews originals.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    To his considerable credit, Cabic rescues several
    obscurities from the dustbin, including the aforementioned ""Sleep a
    Million Years"". First performed by an un-Googleable Dia Joyce, the dreamy
    folk tune is resuscitated with a dewy morning-after vocal performance by Vashti
    Bunyan (someone well-acquainted with musical second acts). ""Lon
    Chaney"", written by genre-hopping, New York
    singer-songwriter Garland Jeffreys and performed stately, if a<span> </span>little detached, by Cabic and Papercuts'
    Jason Quever on piano, is another neat find.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""Lon Chaney"" opens the door to an intriguing point
    of inquiry, though. Like many artists in the period from which Vetiver draws,
    Jeffreys wrote political songs informed by passionately held progressive values
    (in Jeffreys’ case, racial equity). But Vetiver, in breaking their two-year
    absence with a Vaseline-smeared backward glance, emanates a curiously apolitical,
    even reactionary, vibe. Make no mistake, <em>Thing
    of the Past</em> is a perfectly pleasant, well-produced album that offers an
    authorized version of what Vetiver fans already unofficially know about the
    band. And if it doesn't make many false steps, it isn't exactly walking a ledge.

    Young Knives?  Wrong
    kind of cutlery, boys.  Try ""double-edged
    sword.""  ""Fit 4 U"" and ""Terra Firma"" are
    the first and among the finest songs on this platter, built on spiky, lightly
    distorted guitar, ticking hi-hats, and singer Henry Dartnall's urgent, heavily-accented
    bark.  Problem is, there's a, how you
    say, <em>Superabundance </em>of bands that can
    be described the exact same way and to catch up with all of the ones you've tabled
    for a later date would require locking in yourself in some bunker (preferably
    an ""angular"" one) until 2010.  So how
    exactly are these guys supposed to battle general scene fatigue as well as second-record expectations when they risk, at best, being a retread and, at worst, being ignored?</p><p>
    As their sophomore bow suggests, offer, how you say, a <em>Superabundance </em>of mainland styles,
    making you all that harder to pin down-- a bit of Blur here (okay, a big chomp of
    ""Magic America""), some Futureheads there, and top it off with some Arctic
    Monkeys just to be safe. Comparable bands have toyed with similar tweaks, but what the Young Knives have
    going for them is a lower profile-- even if it's about the equal of the
    follow-ups from the Gang of Four gang of four (Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand,
    Futureheads, Maximo Park), it's more likely to be seen as a part of a journey
    as opposed to an endpoint after a fantastic debut.</p><p>
    But as <em>Superabundance </em>grows
    more diffuse-- by the end, they're crafters of minute-long chamber pop and moony
    psychedelia-- it still revolves around the eternal maxim of British rock: ""Modern
    life is rubbish.""  It's a decidedly
    bummer affair, and even though the aggressive tempos suggest they're willing to
    fight against the crushing weight of existence, there's no relief to be found
    anywhere in Dartnall's lyrics-- not in material goods, not in your fellow man,
    and certainly not in romance.  As much as
    Gang of Four's musical influence exerts itself on <em>Superabundance</em>, you could argue that it's the lyrics of ""Anthrax""
    that really sold them for Young Knives.  If
    so, it may have informed Dartnall's unfortunate tendency towards
    overgeneralization: ""Up All Night"" is your garden variety bitterness aimed at
    the stockyard nightmare of club life, but as Dartnall asks, ""What's the point?""
    it sounds sophomorically rhetorical; I mean, people are still having sex and no
    one can seem to stop them, right? 
    Meanwhile, ""Counters"" feigns suicidal, but it's really more bipolar--
    between the dazed harmonies and unhinged caterwauling, it's a heretofore
    unimaginable hybrid of the Cansecos and Cold War Kids.
    </p>
<p>
    Judging from ""Turn Tail"", it's empathy that could probably
    do Young Knives better in the future than consumptive genre-poaching.  The emotional and physical centerpiece of <em>Superabundance</em>, it's hardly a ballad,
    but it retains more heft than most of the miserablist material that surrounds
    it.  ""We are slaves on this ship/ This
    ship's sinking"" might not be the most sensitive or original commentary, at
    least until the next line makes it sound exponentially sadder: ""We will not
    reach the shore.""  It's paradoxically the
    most anthemic moment on <em>Superabundance </em>as
    well, the light-bulb moment where Young Knives realize their strengths but, most
    importantly, start to realize the limitations in them.

    Marc Ribot is tough to put your finger on. He's a left-hander playing guitar right-handed who's turned his natural avant-garde tendencies into a prolific career as a collaborator; to say his music as a solo artist and bandleader is unpredictable is an understatement. He's done
    everything from straightforward rock to no wave to his own spin on
    Latin music in between outside gigs, where he's helped re-invent Tom Waits and worked with John Zorn, Elvis Costello, Alison Kraus, Foetus, Wilson
    Pickett, and Allen Ginsberg, among many others.</p><p>
    This latest album (roughly his 19<sup>th</sup>) finds him in a power trio setting with bassist Shahzad Ismaily and drummer Ches
    Smith, with a sound somewhere between his freakiest no wave outbursts and his
    most direct rock output, with a bit more emphasis on the former. Ribot pokes a
    bit of fun at his own scattershot output on his website, specifying that
    Ceramic Dog is ""not a project; a real band."" There are traces of funk and
    ambient music running through the record, and it opens with the most sickly
    distorted and bastardized cover of the Doors' ""Break on Through"" imaginable-- the
    original's riff has been forcefully molded into a warped funk-punk groove.</p><p>
    It's all done with a certain rambunctious humor that makes
    it seem pretty natural that the noisescape of ""Digital Handshake"" could sit
    just two songs from ""Todo el Mundo Es Kitsch"", a song that lives up to its name
    with wry spoken vocals and a Latin lounge beat. While ""Kitsch""
    is charming, though, ""Handshake"" spends five minutes noodling with harsh noise
    before finally going somewhere, too late to make a difference. Ribot has shown
    in the past that the line between pushing the envelope and outsmarting yourself
    can be ambiguous at best, and this track is an example of him crossing that
    line.
    </p>
<p>
    Ribot's past dips into Latin rock hybrids are traceable on
    certain songs, such as standout ""For Malena"", a song with a stripped-back
    cumbia feel that replaces the usual hand drums with simple clicking and keeps
    the rhythm reserved. The verses are separated by a cool horn arrangement that
    sounds vaguely Balkan, and the track come off as
    similar in tone and construction to some of his best work with Tom Waits. It's
    amazing the way the band just plows through anything he can cook up for it.
    ""Malena"" is immediately followed by the ripping Spanish-language dance track
    ""Pinch"", a punk disco number that leaves lots of room for a hellishly bent
    guitar solo.
    </p>
<p>
    I think the best term to describe the record
    as a whole is ""schizophonic."" Every time you think the band has settled on
    psychedelic disco or blistering avant-noise, they throw another curve at you.
    ""When We Were Young and We Were Freaks"" is a barely-there spoken word/ambient/noise
    piece that reminds me of something Lee Ranaldo might have done on his own in
    the mid-1990s-- it's compelling in its decrepitude and just about the polar
    opposite of ""Todo El Mundo Es Kitsch"". The risk of experimentation is failure,
    and there are parts of this album that just don't work-- see ""Digital Handshake"" and
    the listless free rock mess of the first half of ""Midost"". As much as its
    variety sometimes translates to inconsistency, though, <em>Party Intellectuals</em> is a generally interesting listen and could
    even work as a nice introduction to Ribot's work as a leader for the way it
    runs so much of his gamut.

    Since last year's partially re-recorded and re-released <em>Palo Santo</em>, Shearwater have gone out of their way to assert themselves as more than just an Okkervil River side project or one man's solo recordings, but a living, breathing full band. <em>Rook</em>, however, is their first album-length test, one that reaches deeper into their influences and flexes muscles no one knew they had. Singer and principal songwriter Jonathan Meiburg's voice is just one instrument among many that color these ten tracks, which, in one way, is disappointing, as Meiburg is a stunningly expressive singer who could easily carry a record by himself (see: either edition of <em>Palo Santo</em>). Regardless, they're blessed with engineers who sweat and toil over every incidental noise, guests on everything from clarinet to harp, and a drummer named fucking Thor-- all of whom assert themselves on <em>Rook</em>. This is good news for any listener, but perhaps especially for those who favor the more sensitive and baroque strains of indie rock, yet are tired of hearing it soundtrack every stray minute of public radio or primetime TV: Shearwater give ""pretty"" indie a good name.</p><p>
    From its hushed start to the crunch and swing of its chorus, ""On the Death of the Waters"" is a dramatic opener that announces how much clatter Shearwater 2.0 can make. First single ""Rooks"" is far more ordered and composed, but the attention paid to its craft is discernible, from Meiburg's more controlled vocal performance to the nimble guitar plucking and insistent half-note throb of bass.</p><p>
    ""Leviathan, Bound"" is the first hint at how far the band has stretched its palette, incorporating plenty of strings, glockenspiel, and glassy, mysterious percussion, with Meiburg finally letting out a more immediate howl as the song's simple melody gathers steam. Thor Harris' contributions to the record on percussion are more subtle than his name would imply, but his performances always elevate the song, whether it's the buttoned-up accompaniment of ""Rooks"" to the determined gallop of ""Home Life"", saving its seven woodwind-and-string-laden minutes from sagging. While he serves at the anchor to some tracks, he adds the most vivid touch to the already dramatic bridge of ""Lost Boys"" with a formal military march during its bridge.</p><p>
    A necessary jolt on a well-paced album, Shearwater's attempt to let their collective hair down on the guitar-driven ""Century Eyes"" comes off as forced next to all these cautious and mannered arrangements. They've lost no momentum, however, when they reach the steady rumble of ""The Snow Leopard"", which comes later on the record. It begins with conspicuous unaccompanied piano chords before slow, elemental drums and low single notes of guitar trudge forward, driving the song with the same woozy melodic force of previous Shearwater highlights like ""White Waves"".</p><p>
    The influence of Talk Talk's later records is even more apparent here than on their earlier work, notably in Meiburg's voice as he leans more on his falsetto and exercises restraint. It's also in the instrumentation, which tends towards the drifting and heavily atmospheric. Meiburg's more than capable of hanging with Mark Hollis vocally, and this approach drives the band to considerably expand its sound. Shearwater have not only broken new ground for themselves, but added a welcome sense of variety from track to track on <em>Rook</em>, all in a concise 35 minutes that feels more like a double album in scope.
    </p>
<p>
    Hollis acolytes or not, these are hardly song-sketches; all of them are careful compositions adding new instruments, moods, and sounds around the anchor of Meiburg's voice. The edges of these otherwise lulling, hypnotic songs hint at danger and chaos, but only the brief feedback excursion of ""South Col"" pokes a hole in the album's fabric and hints at what more avant-garde threads the band might be capable of following. As impressive and uniformly gorgeous a record as <em>Rook</em> is, the band's best work is likely still to come.

    Not all prog is created equal.  Take prog metal, for instance.  In one
    corner are Mastodon, who are prog to the core: long songs, lots of
    noodling, worship of 1970s Genesis (at least on the part of drummer
    Brann Dailor, an avowed Phil Collins acolyte).  In the other corner are
    Dream Theater, who are equally prog: long songs, lots of noodling,
    worship of 1970s Rush (at least on the part of drummer Mike Portnoy, an
    avowed Neil Peart acolyte).  Hipsters love Mastodon, but they won't go
    near Dream Theater.  Dream Theater fans are equally unlikely to sport
    Mastodon t-shirts.</p><p>
    Perhaps
    this split is due to friction (in the musical sense).  Mastodon are
    closer to prog as it was in the 70s-- self-indulgent, yes, but also
    earthy and analog.  Dream Theater are the apex of prog's, um,
    progression since then.  They're digitally clean and hyper-precise,
    poster boys for Pro Tools.  For whatever reason, the white belt set
    gravitates towards prog's older aesthetic (<em>see also</em>
    the Mars Volta), while men with ponytails discuss kick drum pedals in
    Dream Theater forums.  If ""indie"" is an aesthetic, it stops at certain
    thresholds of precision and heaviness.</p><p>
    Opeth, interestingly, have straddled both prog aesthetics.  The Swedish band's first record, 1995's <em>Orchid</em>,
    was wonderfully raw.  It was half death metal and half ""other stuff""--
    folk, prog, blues, jazz.  The rawness came from a low budget and
    nascent songwriting, but it conveyed an atmosphere that Opeth never
    regained.  Their records afterwards decreased in friction as their
    chops improved.  In 2002, the band became practically frictionless.  It
    split its heavy and light sides into two records, <em>Deliverance</em> and <em>Damnation</em>; the latter was gorgeously intimate.  2005's <em>Ghost Reveries</em> likewise went down smoothly, like a rich hot chocolate.</p><p>
<em>Watershed</em> is an intriguing exercise in discontinuity.  Unlike <em>Orchid</em>, which was jagged because the band didn't know how to do otherwise, <em>Watershed</em>
    finds Opeth willfully flying their freak flag.  An acoustic intro with
    pleasant male/female singing leads straight into barreling death
    metal.  A piano wanders into ""Hessian Peel"" apropos of nothing. 
    ""Burden"" has an acoustic outro in which one guitarist detunes the
    other's pegs.  It's delightfully horrible-sounding; such goofiness is
    refreshing for a band that's almost offensively virtuosic.</p><p>
    ""The Lotus Eater"" offers the greatest jolts.  An intro of quiet humming
    drops into what seems like the middle of a death metal song-- but with
    disarmingly sunny vocal harmonies.  Three minutes in, dissonant guitar
    lines spiral downwards like DNA strands.  Later, a downright funky vamp
    appears, complete with chattering clavinet, as if Stevie Wonder had
    dropped by the studio.  Aiding such absurdity are Opeth's two new
    members.  Fredrik Åkesson brings lead guitar flash to a band that's
    prided itself on restraint, while drummer Martin Axenrot swings with
    verve.  (Near ""Hessian Peel""'s end is a monstrous groove that's like
    Meshuggah dancing a jig.)</p><p>
    Despite these hijinks, <em>Watershed</em> won't convert Mastodon fans <em>en masse</em>. 
    It still has too many renaissance faire moments; its death metal is as
    aggressive as ever.  After 18 years, Opeth's trademarks are
    well-established-- sinuous riffs, retro 70s keyboards, Mikael
    Åkerfeldt's Jekyll/Hyde act of death growls and mellifluous singing. 
    (He sounds like your lovable Swedish uncle who once recorded a folk
    album.)  But <em>Watershed</em> has friction, and friction brings heat.  Those left cold by metal's po-faced tendencies might well warm up to it.

The crumbled monolith of the Elephant 6 collective still keeps its watchful eye trained on the utopic pop of the Beach Boys; the more traditional freak-folks idolize the psychedelic UK folk movement, which itself espoused Renaissance tradition. Enter Alexis and Lindsay Powell, sibling masterminds of Festival, who implore visitors to their website to ""make fun with these ladies of the forest night,"" pining (no pun intended) for the creature comforts (no pun intended) of an existence quite impossible in their Brooklyn surroundings. Festival's debut album, <em>Come, Arrow, Come!</em> extols the virtues of campfire sing-alongs and epic loves, recklessly twined together with the strands of the girls' sinewy voices. (Pitchfork contributor Mike Powell is a member of Festival, though he does not appear on this album.)</p><p>
    You can easily tell the difference between the sisters. Lindsay opens the leadoff cut ""Fair and True"" with plain, insistent resolve-- ""O the earth has dirtied this lonesome heart""-- and is joined by the trained vibrato of Alexis for the end of the couplet ""And the wind has brought it to you."" As the girls take turns spinning yarns of ageless love, their friends and family join in an unaccompanied chorus, with only spare percussion as counterpoint to an upward-reaching hymn of solemn sincerity. The acoustic guitar only sometimes communicates the songs' progressions, though the girls clearly find inspiration in six-string tradition. In its place, sleigh-bells and creaky pianos gossip a millennium's worth of backwoods musics: the kind of interstitial mantras that echo from the coffeehouse, the church gathering, the picnic, the old-time dance hall, the wild wood.</p><p>
    While this project might belong with the freak-folk revivalists who fetishize Woody Guthrie and the acidic tinges of British folk, <em>Come, Arrow, Come!</em> gets at an elemental simplicity. Renaissance-influenced ballads appear next to songs best suited for a hootenanny. ""Zebulon"" recalls Druidic chants, then the percussive pulse of ""Bind Us All"" follows. The greatest unifying characteristic is the two voices, which swell and bend around each other with a fluency only achieved via familial relation.
    </p><p>
    Simpler than their acerbic cousins Espers, Festival champion aching directness. They're not messianic drum-circle leaders like Devendra Banhart or adherents to substance-induced drone patterns like Six Organs of Admittance's Ben Chasny. In the truest sense of tradition, Lindsay and Alexis pick the low-hanging fruit of acoustic instrumentation as a means to communicate the poetic imagination of a balladic history through their voices. True to their online mission statement, this creative pair isn't celebrating Ameri-Anglo tradition so much as imploring their fellow youth to conceive of a simpler, younger, better time. Considering the predicament of the Informationesque, Nine-Elevenish, Bush Economy world, you'd best appreciate such romantic notions.

Not that heartbreak is a particularly popular thing, but there's always been plenty of it to go around. It's universal, linking the most modest home-recorded navel gazing to the most bombastic and over-produced of top 40 fodder. As the J. Geils Band put, ""love stinks."" Yeah yeah. So Local H's <em>12 Angry Months</em> is hardly the first breakup album, but it's likely one of the few explicitly conceived as such. Following what one imagines was an especially bitter, painful dumping, Lucas wrote a song for each month of the aftermath. By his own account, he wanted to push the usual woe-is-me motif to the limits, baring his soul while stripping his target down to the bone.</p><p>
    But Lucas' bad time is our good time, as he remains one of the few songwriters up to all the Cheap Trick comparisons. After all, Cheap Trick were ultimately more power than pop (at least until they actually went pop), and since their grunge-era breakthrough Local H has kept their muscles toned and flexed. For what is in essence the ultimate expression of inadequacy, self-loathing, failure, and impotence, <em>12 Angry Months</em> is a tough little thing. Whatever girl broke Lucas' heart clearly did at least enough harm to last a calendar year, and Lucas is fighting back.</p><p>
    ""Yeah, I hope you have a lonely life"" he sings in the snarling ""White Belt Boys"", a Greg Dulli-worthy rave-up that correlates to April and follows March's equally unforgiving offering ""BMW Man"" (""this is crazy, I can't believe that you replaced me,"" Lucas sings of his fancy car driving, probably Republican romantic substitute). ""The Summer of Boats"", a rousing power ballad, begins with a touch of forgiveness, but by ""Taxi-Cabs"" Lucas is back to vengeful again. </p><p>
    No one said you can't be angry and catchy, though, and ""24 Hour Break-Up Session"" does both with aplomb, like a more literal-minded Nirvana. ""Jesus Christ! Did You See The Size of the Sperm Whale?"" may be a little in-jokey, but it's not hard to catch the gist of Lucas' vitriol as he catches up with his ex. ""I'm thinking he can have you,"" he snarls. ""You're just a groupie...to think I used to fuck you.""  Ouch. No wonder another power-ballad, ""Simple Pleas"", comes next. ""I can't let go,"" Lucas wails in that one. No kidding. </p><p>
    By the end, the nearly 10-minute ""Hand to Mouth"", Lucas and his former better half have reached some semblance of cease fire (at least in his head), but the damage has already been done. He's already recounted splitting up his record collection in ""The One With 'Kid'"" and a failed attempt at reconciliation in ""Machine Shed Wrestling"" (""as a product you would be great...as a lover, you're just a bust,"" he zings). What's left is exorcising demons. That surely won't get the girl back, especially after the scorched earth approach of <em>12 Angry Months</em>, but at least Lucas got a good record out of the ordeal.<br/></p></div>"|11536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11536-12-angry-months/|6.3|Joshua Klein

Listening to <em>Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow</em> is a little like that. It's also a little like watching clouds drift overhead in layers, scudding cumulus puffs nearby and stretched-out, nearly motionless cirrus high above. It's a little like whale songs, or the gauziest, most slow-motion part of a Sigur Rós song, pulled out over an hour. Imagine if an audio tape, unraveled and stretched out in the breeze, could capture the sound of its own undulations.</p><p>
    That's what Hammock sound like. Lazily, it's drone music, and it plays by its own rules. An event in pop music is the verse going to the chorus, or the double-stop, or the re-introduction of a riff. An event in this music is one note changing to another, or two notes colliding to make a new vibration, or a slow swell in volume that leads to a tiny moment where you can perceive the difference in timbre between the guitar and the keyboard. Andrew Thompson and Marc Byrd check their egos at the door when they record this stuff and simply allow the sounds they generate to meld with one another in an ultra slow-motion dance.</p><p>
    Their last album, 2006's <em>Raising Your Voice...Trying to Stop an Echo</em>, offered a few vocal tracks and a bit of percussion to ground its explorations, but this one is a lot more elemental and simple. It's also an immersive listen if played at the right volume and paid the right amount of attention. Short of that, it works well as ambient music, not so much filling the room with sound as merging with the very air in the room. I swear it practically changes the temperature.
    </p><p>
    Speaking relatively, the most active track is ""Mono No Aware"", which takes its title from a Japanese phrase that roughly means ""the sadness of things."" It opens with a bit of back-masking and drifts through a passages of ethereal guitar, before finally bringing in a solemn cello line. Tonally, it's a calmer, more Zen cousin of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. It's also hard to recommend wholeheartedly-- some people simply won't be able to get to music this placid, and that's fine.

    I'm loathe to call any album a summation of an artist's career-- that reeks of lazy criticism-- but <em>Songs in A&amp;E</em> is certainly Spiritualized's best work in 10 years. All of Jason Pierce's fascinations of the past 20-plus years appear here-- we'll get to 'em soon enough-- in a truly syncretic, muted, and beautiful way. And there's something rooted and grounded about <em>Songs in A&amp;E</em>. Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in place.</p><p>
    This is Pierce's first record in five years-- the delay was, in part, due to him being hospitalized with double pneumonia, i.e. he was really fucked-up and tethered to machines to keep him alive. (In the UK, the ER is called the Accident &amp; Emergency ward-- hence the title.) Not surprisingly, Pierce's ordeal colors the sound and tone of the record-- ""Death Take Your Fiddle"", essentially another update of the traditional ""O Death"", seems to sample the sound of a respirator-- although Pierce has stated in interviews that the album was already more than half-finished when he took ill.</p><p>
    Lyrically, as Pierce as wont to do, there are love songs, drug songs, and God songs-- typically, they're all those things at once at times. Pierce's protagonist on these tunes is world-weary (""So hard to fight when you're losing/ I got a little fire in my soul,"" he says on ""I Gotta Fire"") and sounds all the more so in Pierce's lovely croaking/cracking vocals. What saves the songs from woe-is-me solipsism and overarching sentimentality is a well-hidden but ironic sense of humor. Well, that and the fact that the music itself is awesome. The key song is ""Borrowed Your Gun"", which begins like a typical junkie lament with ""Daddy I'm sorry"" but continues into murder ballad territory with ""I borrowed your gun again/ Shot up your family.""
    </p>
<p>
    A few songs on <em>Songs in A&amp;E</em> run on a bit too long-- this is a Spiritualized record, after all-- and from some angles a few arrangements can sound hokey. The big rocker ""I Gotta Fire"" is like the Stone Roses covering Sonic Youth's ""Bull in the Heather"", but even on lesser tracks, a delightful oboe or a crazy lyric or a swelling gospel chorus swoops in and gives you a reason to replay the track. Pierce is again walking mopey, orchestral, minimalist rock out to the margins of taste and messing with your head all over the place. And this time he does it with a shit-ton of sonic subtlety. (Take those earbuds out and pop this one on the stereo.)
    </p>
<p>
    Pierce has never seemed so in control of his aesthetic, rather than controlled <em>by</em> it like some sort of drone-rock fetishist. The props dropped here are super obvious, and meant to be so, whether to Daniel Johnston with the ""Funeral Home"" refrain or to Kris Kristofferson with a quotation from ""Me &amp; Bobby McGee"". Prior releases each had enjoyable but indulgent bliss-out tracks that went on a long time, but on <em>A&amp;E</em> the out sounds are distilled into six miniature numbered tracks each called ""Harmony"". These serve as a glue holding the album together, and while they're ""spacey,"" their brevity keeps the record on solid terrestrial ground. The other songs are vessels for contrasting ideas: la-la melodies vs. wah-wah guitar, strings vs. brass, country licks vs. Free Design-style vocals, and simple structures vs. lush arrangements. These oppositional concepts overlap more than ever on <em>A&amp;E</em>, but the album only sounds muddled or muddied during a few clunky transitions. And weirdly, those serve to make you more aware than ever of the greatness of what he's doing the rest of the time.

Its production teams provide the engineers for global Top 40 sounds; in men like Jens Lekman and Johan Agebjörn it produces theorists of pop classicism; and its own top-sellers, like Robyn and now Lykke Li, are welcomed into collections which otherwise carefully sidestep the commercial. So it's not wholly surprising that <em>Youth Novels</em>, Li's first full-length album, has the air of the workshop about it. The careful, spartan production-- by Bjorn Yttling of Peter Björn and John-- asks listeners to do more work than most pop records allow for. At its frequent best, the record manages to sketch out widescreen hit songs with a remarkable economy of means. At its more occasional worst, the tracks feel frustratingly underthought.</p><p>
    The foundation for the successful songs tends to be voice and bass: the bass thick with reverb, the voice cute and close-up. Around this Yttrling-- who co-writes all the tracks-- places other instruments: splashes of piano or woodblock, petite guitar phrases, keyboard buzzes. The trick-- and they pull it off over and over again-- is to bring all the elements together on the chorus for a big hooky payoff. Of course for this to work they need strong choruses-- ""I'm Good, I'm Gone"", ""Let It Fall"", ""Hanging High"", and others provide them. Standout ""Dance Dance Dance"" has one of the stickiest refrains on the album, and one of the most audacious instrumental builds-- close-mic'ed bass, tippy-tappy percussion, and then suddenly a cheeky sax nudging its way into the track and scrapping puppyishly around its edges. If you don't smile at that, Lykke Li is probably not for you.</p><p>
    With so many surprises in the arrangements, you might overlook what a strength Li herself is, how well she unifies <em>Youth Novels</em>' scattershot imagination.  It's easy to dismiss her style as overly cutesy-- the babytalk chorus on first single ""Little Bit"", for instance-- and her fragility can seem annoyingly affected. But don't be fooled-- she's in total command of the songs, and her breathy fuzziness fits the wireframe aesthetic better than a fuller voice would. There are also hints that Li would be as happy with a richer sound-- on the beautiful ""My"" she's rolled and washed by cymbal, string, and echo and lets them envelop her without erasing her.</p><p>
    Not all experiments work though, and when realizing ideas is less important than having them you're entering a slightly dangerous area. Li gives you fair warning that she'll do what she wants-- opener ""Melodies and Desires"" is ornamentally lovely but you won't linger long on its spoken-word philosophies. Even so, when her judgement fails to match her talent it can be painful going. Electro trudge ""Complaint Department"" in particular is dreary and grating enough to risk throwing your faith in the whole project off-beam: It doesn't help that Li can't remotely bring the venom the song needs. Thankfully she follows it with ""Breaking It Up"", one of her most vigorous and likeable tracks, whose blend of multi-tracked squawks and wandering synthesisers make for one of the album's most joyful moments.</p><p>
    Chart music today is often so gloriously maximal that reproducing any of its thrills on limited means can seem an impossible task. By paying attention to detail, Yttling and Li's prove that doesn't have to be the case. But even more impressive is the way their intimate, playful miniatures capture the daring and novelty of modern pop, as well as its hooks.</p></div>"|11414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11414-youth-novels/|7.8|Tom Ewing

    drug-trip comparisons while attempting to describe how music sounds, there's a
    particular effect of failed, go-nowhere attempts at psychedelic rock: It aims
    for making you feel like you're high, or at least able to empathize with the
    notion of feeling high, but instead it's like you're actually stuck in a room
    with someone else who's high while you're sober. They're having the time of
    their lives, experiencing all sorts of mind-altering creativity, and here you
    are watching them flail around inanely-- or, worse yet, they just
    sit there staring into space. Even with a few good-to-great moments, this
    happens frequently during <em>Directions to See a Ghost</em>, the second
    full-length from Austin's Black Angels: The trip is implied, but it's all a secondhand
    narrative that loses almost everything in translation. The band members play under the
    impression that they're going somewhere, but it's a completely different place
    than where they actually are, and in either case there doesn't even really seem
    to be much of a destination in the first place.</p><p>
    Put this album amidst a
    thousand other songs on your mp3 player of choice, and eventually one of the tracks
    will come up, and it'll sound unique and startling and impressively fuzzed-out
    and evil for a couple minutes. Odds are it'll then go on for another three or
    six or 14 until it becomes clear how little their grinding, snarling
    riffs and heavy-footed rhythms hold up under constant repetition. Sometimes
    this drone is enough to snatch your breath; there's enough of a melody (and a
    compellingly creepy one at that) in ""18 Years"" to sustain the song's five and a half
    minutes, and the slow, hypnotic swagger of ""Mission District"" pulls you in long
    enough to let one of the few really powerful crescendos on the album to hit you
    dead-on. And even if it takes a while to get to its core, ""Never/Ever"" peaks
    with this burst of high-speed chaos that condenses everything cool about
    ""Sister Ray"" into an efficiently malicious explosion</p><p>
    But those songs come after an
    opening volley of not much, as the vertiginous midtempo shoegaze of opener ""You
    on the Run"" melts into the lurching, swooning ""Doves"" and then into the
    thumping sludge of ""Science Killer"", each song canceling out whatever
    sensations you might have felt from the previous. And all the interminable
    record-ending ""Snake in the Grass"" really does once it gets going (""going"" used
    loosely) is get a bit slower two-thirds of the way through its 16 minutes. Is it
    really worth listening to a song that goes on for more than a quarter of an
    hour if it actually <em>loses</em> energy the more it goes on?
    </p><p>
    The bastard of it is that the
    lyrics fit the tone well-- all gloomy invocations of warfare, betrayal,
    paranoia, and self-obsession. And these people can play: There's some sparks
    when guitarist Christian Bland snaps out of his robo-strumming and actually
    sets about cranking out frightening peals of noise, Stephanie Bailey's drumming
    is forcefully solid even when the rhythms threaten to lull you into inattention,
    and every time I try to think of who lead singer Alex Maas is derivative of, I
    keep flashing back on their solid-enough 2006 debut <em>Passover </em>instead,
    which is as good a sign as any of how distinct his flat but doomed-sounding
    wail is. And if you isolate any random 45 seconds of <em>Directions to See a
    Ghost</em>'s 70 minutes, you'll definitely be compelled to listen for another
    few minutes-- after which time you'll probably start waiting for a solo or a
    shift in tone that might not even come. One thing I've tried to keep in mind is
    the fact that the Black Angels tend to play live with film accompaniment, so
    maybe it works better in that context. Perhaps they could help those of us
    without any drugs by pressing this stuff on a DVD next time around.

    Not much changes in the space station Jason Albertini and Canaan Dove Amber call home. After a decade of producing celestial music unperturbed by outside stimuli, the duo's heavenly stare remains unwavering, their minds still blown by how, like, huge the universe is, man. But while their former band Duster felt content to drift through the universe in near suspended animation, Albertini and Amber are willing to make spin-off project Helvetia sweat for its cosmic bliss. Their 2006 debut <em>The Clever North Wind</em> barely had a pulse, but the uneasy psych leanings and dark moods made the album anything but a stroll through the galaxy. Building off that, <em>The Acrobats</em> culls an even wider range of emotions from the band's combined sigh, showcasing surprisingly sharp (but sedated) pop chops carefully preserved in amber.</p><p>
    It's no secret that scintillating guitar parts provide the fuel for Helvetia's space odyssey. On <em>Acrobats</em>, they're not afraid to set their axes to warp speed, even if it means sacrificing some of the lo-fi minimalism they're loved for. With guest appearances from veteran jamsters like Built to Spill's Brett Nelson and ex-Dinosaur Jr. bassist Mike Johnson, they're more than capable of pulling off densely layered gems like ""Blasting Carolina"", a kaleidoscopic epic traversing folk, glam, and sunny psych-pop. Standout track ""Old New Bicycle"" may carry the requisite stoner vibe associated with these guys, but it's more white soul than jam band. ""Honest Gods"" and ""Summer"" carry a similarly geeky libido, sounding too mathematical to be legitimately cool but, like equally stiff-postured acts the Walkmen or Kings of Convenience, pulling off the pop hooks all the same.</p><p>
    So where does all this fretboard brio leave the vocals? Well, for the most part, buried six feet under the mix. When there isn't a nifty effect like the tube radio crooning on ""The Fever"" or ""Honest Gods""'s chipmunk-pitched harmonies, the melodies unfold pretty inconspicuously. Fortunately a three-note range goes a long way in Helvetia's brand of molasses pop, but when some of these songs do feel like boiling over (and yes, some actually do), the vocals aren't up to the task. That said, <em>Acrobats</em> proves a surprisingly engaging album from musicians who by all respects could be switching on autopilot at this point in their careers. Instead, they produce their catchiest piece of work to date while still keeping their riffs plentiful and their altitude at a steady 500,000 feet.

The pseudonymous duo of Mister Furia and Professor Manso put something for every euro-waving reveler on their 2006 stateside debut, <em>The Million Colour Revolution</em>, dabbling in lounge, bossa nova, funk, and enough other genres to keep up with their Spanish, English, French, and German lyrics. Prodded along by dance beats, the album also hearkened back to the 1990s' internationalist indie pop of groups like Pizzicato Five and Cibo Matto.</p><p>
<em>Wild Animals</em>, which follows last year's <em>More Colours!</em> remix LP, plays around in the same pluralistic pool. Although its stylistic breadth still dizzies, the ideas have started to sound a little shallow. There's Daft Punk electro-kitsch here, woozy Air luxuriance over there, and plenty of Beta Band-esque harmonies all around, but the allusions are rarely as satisfying as the hypothetical record collection they represent. At a time when U.S. music listeners are already enjoying a particularly diverse assortment of global sounds-- from Bollywood to the Balkans, Kunduru to chanson, Afropop to gamelan, by American artists and international ones-- an album can't get by on its border-crossing eclecticism alone. <em>Wild Animals</em> is a party in international waters; what it lacks is an occasion.</p><p>
    Not that Furia and Manso have lost their high, supple voices or jingle-ready melodies. With a squishily funky bass line, opener ""Hold On"" winds up sounding like a self-help Beck-- ""Hold on to your dreams, 'cause it's a long way home,"" the singers repeat-- but not until after a choir-like intro that's the best homage to Brian Wilson's <em>SMiLE</em> opener ""Our Prayer"" since the Earlies did one back in 2004. ""S.E.X.Y. R.O.B.O.T."", meanwhile, is silly electro-house fun that soon wears out its welcome-- good luck getting that vocoder-like spelling lesson out of your head, though. The Pinker Tones do best when they set their globe-pillaging ideas to more fully-fledged songs, as on first single ""Happy Everywhere"", a scrambled acoustic-pop song with squelching synths, Mancini-esque strings, cowbell, and a chorus that's at once cheerful and a bit paranoid. The wordless ""Fugaz"" is thwomping blog-house, ready for its Modular signing; another standout, ""24"", confronts a quarter-life crisis with a horns-blasting chorus.
    </p><p>
    The Pinker Tones' pan-genre versatility and fearless pursuit of fun could've made them a Spanish Super Furry Animals, but a few of these songs could do with a bit more super (possibly fur, too). ""Biorganised""-- with some burbling bass, translucent acoustic guitar, and a harmonica solo-- follows the <em>Moon Safari</em> template too closely for its own good. ""Working Bees"" is tuneful, falsetto-led space-funk that likens the band to bees ""making honey for your ears."" Oh, and ""The Whistling Song"" is four minutes of ska about whistling. The Pinker Tones already tried much of this stuff more successfully on their last proper LP; as refreshing as it still is to hear a group so unconstrained by a single sound, the songs on <em>Wild Animals</em> can't quite fill the wider world their style envisions. I for one welcome our new alien overlords.

    The one-man band has come a long way from the stereotypical busker
    laden with instruments from head to foot.  With today's technology, individuals often surpass the capabilities and limits of full bands.  Black metal, in
    particular, has embraced solo recording for aesthetic and practical
    reasons.  The artform's venom is antisocial; recording at home is also
    cheaper and less hassle than practice spaces and bandmates.  Lacking
    the metal-rich environment and close distances of their European
    counterparts, American black metallers have made the one-man format
    uniquely theirs.  Lone wolves like Xasthur, Krohm, and Sapthuran turn
    black metal's explosive energy inwards; Leviathan is arguably the most
    potent of the lot.</p><p>
    Like
    his colleagues, San Francisco's Leviathan (aka Wrest) deals with
    depressive/suicidal themes.  But unlike them, he wields instrumental
    prowess that amplifies the personal into the epic.  Drums are his first
    instrument, and they propel his songs through widely varied feels:
    light-speed blastbeats, mid-paced trudges, tricky math meters.  On
    guitar, he fluently dials up the raw primitiveness of black metal's
    first wave, the romantic nihilism of the second wave, and shoegazer
    sheets of sound.  His bass lines have an unmatched warmth and
    fluidity.  He's also a celebrated tattoo artist; his wrenching artwork
    adorns albums by Heresi, Winterblut, and himself.  In short, he is the
    total package.</p><p>
<span id=""z19f0""><em>Massive Conspiracy Against All Life</em></span>
    is aptly-titled; Wrest sounds like he's throwing everything and the
    kitchen sink against the world.  His are the bitterest symphonies-- in
    a past life, he was probably a composer whose works caused riots-- and
    <span id=""z19f1""><em>Conspiracy</em></span> is his rage writ
    large.  Leviathan's discography (three full-lengths, numerous demos
    and splits) has varied widely in production values; <span id=""z19f2""><em>Conspiracy</em></span> is the first time his apocalypse has had a sound to match.</p><p>
    The
    record evokes both a missile attack and its aftermath.  Eerie jangles
    swoop down on ""Made as the Stale Wine of Wrath"", paving the way for a
    ground assault of blastbeats.  ""Vesture Dipped in the Blood of Morning""
    has what sounds like a martial orchestral sample, as if Sousa had
    written not for triumph but for tragedy.  ""Noisome Ash Crown""
    deceptively meanders in a fog, then unleashes a stomping death march. 
    Wrest's voice rises above the fray like a warlord general; unlike his
    colleagues, who often sound like malnourished witches, he declaims with
    a commanding growl.  Yet his attack is not all blitzkrieg.  Wrest
    adeptly conjures up wind-like sounds, whether through guitars or
    electronic means, and much of the record feels like a sepulchral cave. 
    The Book of Revelation has many metal soundtracks, but few have
    channeled its torment this vividly.</p><p>
    Lurker
    of Chalice is a project by Wrest that released an eponymous full-length
    in 2005.  The release gained cult status, with accompanying eBay
    prices, and Southern Lord has reissued it with a bonus track.  Lurker
    of Chalice is Leviathan's drugged-out cousin; black metal is still the
    starting point, but the departure points are more varied.  ""Wail""'s
    buzzing miasma is as if Angelo Badalamenti scored actual nightmares and
    not just hints of them.  ""Spectre As Valkerie Is"" glows with a luminous
    shoegazer aura, with small shooting stars of melodies.  Clean tones
    form a densely gorgeous web in ""Vortex Chalice"".  ""Minions"" lays strips
    of twang atop slabs of doom.  ""This Blood Falls as Mortal, Pt. 3"" has
    seasick, kazoo-like melodies and a curiously perky 808 hi-hat.  Wrest
    even tries out actual singing in ""Granite"", but shrouds it in haunting
    echoes.</p><p>
    But for all its dreaminess, <em>Lurker</em>
    still brings the hammer.  The atonal glissandos of ""Piercing Where They
    Might"" resemble demonic vacuum cleaners; ""Spectre"" begins with wrecking
    balls for riffs.  For unknown reasons, Wrest is retiring the Leviathan
    name, so his future output will be as Lurker of Chalice.  Each project
    already has elements of the other, so their unification promises more
    of the same: the sound of the end of the world.

    record evokes both a missile attack and its aftermath.  Eerie jangles
    swoop down on ""Made as the Stale Wine of Wrath"", paving the way for a
    ground assault of blastbeats.  ""Vesture Dipped in the Blood of Morning""
    has what sounds like a martial orchestral sample, as if Sousa had
    written not for triumph but for tragedy.  ""Noisome Ash Crown""
    deceptively meanders in a fog, then unleashes a stomping death march. 
    Wrest's voice rises above the fray like a warlord general; unlike his
    colleagues, who often sound like malnourished witches, he declaims with
    a commanding growl.  Yet his attack is not all blitzkrieg.  Wrest
    adeptly conjures up wind-like sounds, whether through guitars or
    electronic means, and much of the record feels like a sepulchral cave. 
    The Book of Revelation has many metal soundtracks, but few have
    channeled its torment this vividly.</p><p>
    Lurker
    of Chalice is a project by Wrest that released an eponymous full-length
    in 2005.  The release gained cult status, with accompanying eBay
    prices, and Southern Lord has reissued it with a bonus track.  Lurker
    of Chalice is Leviathan's drugged-out cousin; black metal is still the
    starting point, but the departure points are more varied.  ""Wail""'s
    buzzing miasma is as if Angelo Badalamenti scored actual nightmares and
    not just hints of them.  ""Spectre As Valkerie Is"" glows with a luminous
    shoegazer aura, with small shooting stars of melodies.  Clean tones
    form a densely gorgeous web in ""Vortex Chalice"".  ""Minions"" lays strips
    of twang atop slabs of doom.  ""This Blood Falls as Mortal, Pt. 3"" has
    seasick, kazoo-like melodies and a curiously perky 808 hi-hat.  Wrest
    even tries out actual singing in ""Granite"", but shrouds it in haunting
    echoes.</p><p>
    But for all its dreaminess, <em>Lurker</em>
    still brings the hammer.  The atonal glissandos of ""Piercing Where They
    Might"" resemble demonic vacuum cleaners; ""Spectre"" begins with wrecking
    balls for riffs.  For unknown reasons, Wrest is retiring the Leviathan
    name, so his future output will be as Lurker of Chalice.  Each project
    already has elements of the other, so their unification promises more
    of the same: the sound of the end of the world.

It was one of many elements that defined him in the beginning, on his band's hugely popular 1994 self-titled debut (<i>The Blue Album</i>), if one of few remaining characteristics defining his music today.</p>
<p>Following poor initial sales of the record's follow-up, the more introspective cult hit <i>Pinkerton</i>, Cuomo famously retreated from the public eye. Over the next five years, the band would remain silent, cultivating goodwill and an ever-growing army of fans. But most of that goodwill has deteriorated since their re-emergence in 2001, in the wake of three mediocre-to-awful albums that were, in many ways, the opposite of what made Cuomo's band so adored in the first place.</p>
<p>Sadly, the once burned-out Weezer continue to fade away: Those first two records capture their decade in 75 minutes of near-perfect power-pop: straight-faced irony, eccentric sincerity, meta references, and bipolar guitar distortion from ordinary-looking outcasts who became stars and then complained about it. Punk that's too catchy to offend. Pop that's too smart to cop to itself. And, uh, emo. After <i>Pinkerton</i>, the deluge; rap-metal and post-grunge wound up so thoroughly conquering modern rock that now even staunch rockists are making excited noises about ""American Idol"" winner David Cook. Hey, <i>somebody</i>'s supposed to save mainstream rock'n'roll, right?</p>
<p>Not these guys. Beginning with 2001's so-so <i>Green Album</i> and plumbing Jules Verne depths with 2005's terrible <i>Make Believe</i>, the band began to take on some of the most infuriating characteristics of the very bands that had replaced them during their absence: intelligence-insulting songwriting, cookie-cutter dynamics, questionable facial hair. At the very least, <i>The Red Album</i> (as Weezer have nicknamed their latest) is a first step toward rehabilitation-- a tacit admission that recent discs, with their empty universality and recycled riffs, had a problem. But it's not a return to glory unless you consider 2001 their glory days.</p>
<p>Judging by appetizing first single ""Pork and Beans"", <i>The Red Album</i> could've been almost as funny and catchy as <i>Pinkerton</i>'s ""El Scorcho"", only from the perspective of a married man coming up on 40. It's as if last year's demos compilation, <i>Alone</i>, helped Cuomo remember how to do this stuff right. His sarcastic mention of super-producer Timbaland's chart magic is as hilarious as it is on-point-- especially after Madonna's dreadful, Tim-helmed #1 single, ""4 Minutes"". Jacknife Lee (who co-produced the album along with <i>Make Believe</i> overseer Rick Rubin) lets the chorus explode from the mix in a way that little on the radio does anymore. It demands to be sung by millions of uncomprehending bar-goers.</p>
<p>With an opening Rogaine reference, ""Pork and Beans"" also establishes <i>The Red Album</i>'s main theme. Already a self-described ""old man"" on <i>Pinkerton</i>, Cuomo is focused these days on reliving his lost youth-- probably the same reason some of us still listen to Weezer albums. Lead track and third single ""Troublemaker"" starts back in school, a faint whiff of existential angst and a surging bridge helping to redeem a vapid chorus and monotonous, familiar-sounding guitars. The laughably bad ""Heart Songs"" is <i>The Blue Album</i>'s nostalgic ""In the Garage"" schmaltzed up as a sort of name-dropping ""Circle of Life""; if Nirvana had ""the chords that broke the chains I had upon me,"" kudos to Cuomo for swiping them on the otherwise forgettable teenage prankfest ""Everybody Get Dangerous"" (to quote: ""boo-yahhh"").</p>
<p>At this point, Weezer is as much a brand as a band. When Cuomo relinquishes the mic, <i>The Red Album</i> could be by any group of modern-rock mediocrities. Longtime guitarist Brian Bell gets throaty and twangy like a poor man's Rob Thomas on repetitive non-apology ""Thought I Knew"", backed by bland acoustic guitar and a TR-808 drum machine. Bassist Scott Shriner speak-sings in creepy stalker mode on ""Cold Dark World"", with Cuomo swooping to the rescue on the choruses. ""Automatic"", led by original drummer Pat Wilson, returns to the faceless crunching of 2002's <i>Maladroit</i>.</p>
<p>Not that Cuomo needs other voices to reveal that <i>The Red Album</i> is hardly the work of idiosyncratic auteurship the first couple of singles could've suggested. He sings on peppy, tempo-switching ""Dreamin'"" and the grandiose finale, ""The Angel and the One"", but for all their background-friendly polish, both are typical, vacuous latter-day Weezer tracks.</p>
<p><i>The Red Album</i>'s most ambitious song adapts the Shaker hymn ""Simple Gifts"". The melody, played first on piano recalling <i>Pinkerton</i>'s ""Across the Sea"", is more obvious than the Erik Satie snippet Cuomo ganked for <i>The Blue Album</i>'s ""Surf Wax America"", but now, as then, the theft isn't the point. ""The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)"" is the warped genius let loose, from half-rapped intro to Queen bombast to baroque a cappella. Like the YouTube culture the ""Pork and Beans"" video depicts so well, the song-- and this album-- relies on a high quantity of short-lived pretty good ideas to distract from a shortage of great ones.</p></div>"|11568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11568-weezer-the-red-album/|4.7|Marc Hogan

    Not only was <em>Witching Hour</em>
    one of the better albums of 2005, it more or less saved Ladytron's career. For
    a group that sprang up right on time for the whole early-aughts electroclash
    morass to subsume them, the
    group's transformation to a subtly more melodic, pop-friendly, and emotionally expressive
    style made a lot of sense, both in terms of stylistic evolution and just plain
    old self-preservation. It's the same instinct that kept New Order and Depeche
    Mode going long after people stopped using the term ""new wave"" in
    earnest-- and even if there was still plenty of runway-walk detachment in their sound, the music made it feel perfectly human.</p><p>
    But there's another human
    impulse that keeps the follow-up <em>Velocifero </em>from hitting quite as hard,
    and that's the desire to stick with what works, especially if that formula took
    you to another level. There's not much wrong with that method where this
    album's concerned; substituting refinement and subtle expansion for constant
    evolution isn't that heinous a crime, and being big on <em>Witching Hour </em>will
    probably lead you to appreciate <em>Velocifero</em> in a more reserved way.
    There's no pinned-to-your-seat blowaways like ""Destroy Everything You Touch"" or
    ""High Rise"", a shortage of legitimately affecting ballads in the vein of ""All
    the Way..."" or ""Beauty*2"", and a severe dearth of the subtle levity that made <em>Witching
    Hour </em>an expansive record-- in other words, there's really not a lot of
    immediacy to <em>Velocifero</em> at all.</p><p>
    What this record does have is a solid number of goth-pop hookfests. Compared to the highlights of
    their previous records, the songs on <em>Velocifero </em>have more movement than
    actual force; the shuffle-glam ""Ghosts"" gets surprisingly little bass-range
    impact from such a heavy stomp, and the rapid synth-pop
    pulses on ""I'm Not Scared"" and ""Season of Illusions"" threaten to
    slip from a groove to a rut if you think of them strictly in terms of rhythm.
    (For a record with some input from Ed Banger electro-pop remix specialists
    Vicarious Bliss, that's kind of hard to imagine.)
    </p>
<p>
    But the vocals make up for
    that, and aside from the occasional lyrical clunker (from ""Versus"": ""like a
    kitten versus rain""-- d'aww, sniffle), it's impressive how Helen Marnie and
    Mira Aroyo take empty-on-paper lyrics and give them meaning through sheer
    repetition.
    We've already heard more than
    enough about little runaways from Del Shannon (and, uh, Bon Jovi), but Marnie's
    singing in ""Runaway"" sweetly offsets the harsh snarl of <em>Velocifero</em>'s
    hardest-hitting instrumental backing and turns a pop cliché (""Where you waking
    up today/ My little runaway"") into a haunting refrain. The aforementioned
    ""Ghosts"" works because its enigmatic hook-- ""There's a ghost in me/ Who wants to
    say I'm sorry/ Doesn't mean I'm sorry""-- is delivered with Marnie's note-perfect
    sing-song delivery, a simultaneously taunting and regretful voice which not
    only gives the words gravity but lends a good amount of weight to an otherwise
    flat-sounding song. And Mira Aroyo, relatively scarce on <em>Witching Hour</em>,
    has more opportunities to showcase her icy, sharp, often-foreboding voice, singing
    in her native Bulgarian with a sinister deadpan on ""Black Cat"" and a sleek,
    mellifluous energy on traditional folk song ""Kletva""; in English her raspy purr
    turns the circa-1990 techno-pop of ""Deep Blue"" into a seething come-on.
    </p>
<p>
    Writers and fans like to talk
    about how wintry and cold Ladytron's music is, which might be the album's real
    shortcoming; maybe it'll sound a bit more appropriate five or six months after
    its June release when its isolated iciness has a suitable environmental
    backdrop. But even with a somewhat diminished speaker-filling capability and a couple
    of songs that seem to have less actual energy than they should, <em>Velocifero</em>'s
    subtlety will eventually reward further listens. Not everything has to be an
    exclamation point or a CGI explosion, and even if Ladytron excel in big, instant-grab
    attention-getting pop maneuvers, the dearth of them here only means that
    they've got a good venue to prove they can get by OK on restraint.

    It's easy to think that music made by relatively few people, with relatively familiar instruments, should fall under the canopy of ""folk"": uncluttered, transparent, linked to past traditions. Wildbirds and Peacedrums-- husband-and-wife Swedes Andreas Werliin and Mariam Wallentin-- compose most of their debut, <em>Heartcore</em>, with Werliin's compact drum work and Wallentin's orbital, precise vocals; there is an arc to their work that imbues it with the austerity and heartiness (no pun) of folk music. Despite its simple ingredients, <em>Heartcore</em> is neither native nor instinctual. ""Primal"" or ""sparse"" miss the point, too; <em>Heartcore</em>, instead, is cleverly orchestrated pop music preternaturally reliant on the skills of its performers: Both Werliin and Wallentin were music school dropouts, and their technically sound playing disguises the complexity and range of <em>Heartcore</em>'s material.</p><p>
    The album <em>Heartcore</em> strangely resembles is Nina Simone's <em>In Concert</em>; where Simone used tactful playing and sly phrasing to redress Gershwin or a song about pirates, W&amp;P build murder ballads with tinny, metronomic percussion and tense rock'n'roll with handclaps and double-tracked wails. Other instruments-- electric piano, rippling guitar, moony organ-- are in the mix as ornamentation: Only the drums are allowed to roll downhill. Wallentin mimics Simone's deep, mannish voice and almost asexual engagement with her material but oversell/rhetoric aside she rightfully garners comparisons to Björk's bluster or Joanna Newsom's clench. (Another contemporary: The first line in ""Bird"" is actually ""I am a bird now."") Wallentin's legit pipes carry <em>Heartcore</em>'s swirling, clackety uptempo numbers: ""Doubt/Hope"", ""The Way Things Go"", and ""The Ones That Should Save Me Get Me Down"" rely on little more than Werliin's tethered kitwork.  Doubt is a theme whenever the lyrics seem autobiographical, to the point where ""The Way Things Go"" serves as proper self-help: ""I neeeeeed/ To love myseeeeelf/ More.""</p><p>
    Werliin steps from behind his kit to duet on the violent ""The Battle in Water"" and his comparatively untrained male vox sounds phantasmal: ""I am in the wilderness/ You turned out my light/ This time I will make things right/ I get cold by fire/ She said…"" and then Wallentin again, ""Let me swim/ I'm no one's pet."" W&amp;P may have overplayed their hand a bit naming the album <em>Heartcore</em>, but they deserve credit for these resonant, personal dramas.</p><p>
    The instrumental framing of the album allows the W&amp;P plenty of elbow room, but <em>Heartcore</em> still fails when the duo becomes overly reliant on balladry: Whatever percussion/string instrument plinks along with ""Lost Love"" can't draw a melody out of Wallentin; ""Nakina""'s buttressed bass kicks are the only arrangement that might be called out as lazy, and both move at a glacial pace. </p><p>
    During ""Mississippi Goddam"" Nina Simone exclaims, to the delight of the crowd, ""This is a showtune, but the show hasn't been written for it yet""; <em>Heartcore</em> exemplifies this sense of constructed intrigue: Wallentin notes, ""All of the people are running to the theater."" Peek, too, at the resplendent closer, ""We Hold Each Other Song"", tipping its cards in two movements: first a low-hum organ dirge and then a loving, jaunty coda. ""The inside is not new,"" Wallentin states. True, but what Werliin and Wallentin surround it with requires plenty of exploration.

    You can't accuse Nik Freitas of not putting his best
    foot forward. His fourth LP (and first for Conor Oberst's Team Love imprint)
    opens with its sparkling title track-- a burst of mellow California sunshine featuring shuffling
    percussion, breezy guitar work, and Freitas' easy, warm voice. Its
    finger-picked guitar arpeggios are reminiscent of those from Nico's poignantly
    Germanic version of ""These Days"", but they re-imagine that song's brittle bones as a
    robust foundation for an upbeat vocal melody that gently rises and falls. It's not just a summery pop gem, though; buried beneath its
    lackadaisical pace and elegant piano bridge is lyrical gravitas. Despite its
    deceptively sweet sound, it is riddled with darkness and uncertainty-- there's a reason
    almost every line starts with the words, ""I want to know."" Sadly nothing else on <em>Sun
    Down</em> is quite as good.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Freitas, an L.A.-by-way-of-Visalia
    singer/songwriter wrote, performed, and recorded everything on this album
    himself in a home studio that he lovingly created piecemeal via Craigslist. So,
    despite his album's effortless vibe, Freitas has obviously taken great pains
    with his work. He, like his inland Cali
    colleague Jason Lytle (of Grandaddy), has turned a lifelong Beatles fixation
    into impeccably arranged modern pop. (Check out the ""Rocky Raccoon""-style piano
    jaunt ""All The Way Down"".) But for someone who used to photograph
    skaters for a magazine as aggro-named as <em>Thrasher</em>,
    most of <em>Sun Down</em> seems so laid back
    that it's practically asleep. Like a mainland Jack Johnson with a vintage
    piano, Freitas seems to only write in one mid-tempo dynamic, and his cozy salve
    of a baritone is almost too soothing, so much so that it threatens to lull
    listeners to sleep.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""Sophie"" wants to be a bluesy Ryan Adams rocker, but with
    its out-of-place horns and middling lyrics, it doesn't have quite enough fire.
    (Say what you will about Adams, but his
    heroines have bigger, more dramatic problems than being mopey and needing to ""find
    some way to smile."") Spare piano ballad ""What You Become"" gets the intimacy
    right-- you can almost hear Freitas' fingers press against the smooth ivory
    keyboard-- but because it is so repetitive and lacks any clear hooks, it falls
    flat. And though ""Love Around"" is weirder and more majestic than the rest of
    the record-- it's built on layers of ghostly atmospherics worthy of <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> soundtrack and fills
    its hefty sound out with chunky drum fills and a churchy-sounding backing choir--
    its main vocal melody meanders so aimlessly that it, too, is rendered
    unmemorable.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<em>Sun Down</em> ends not
    with a bang, but with a whimper, leaving listeners with ""Shhhh"", a song that,
    even in its title, urges restraint. And perhaps that's Freitas' biggest
    problem: His songs are too quietly controlled. His <span> </span>arrangements are admirable-- on the album
    closer his whispered sibilant sounds melt over an organ that buzzes in the
    distance, lapping at the edge of a rolling piano line-- so if he could just learn
    to indulge a little, to give in to an anthemic chorus or explore dynamic
    differences, his songs would be worthy of his pristine production.

    Bun B is a solo artist not by choice but by necessity. After spending a decade and a half in the legendary Texas rap duo UGK, Bun found himself all alone in 2002, when Pimp C, his partner, went to prison on a parole-violation charge. With Pimp gone, Bun hit the guest appearance circuit hard and eventually released <em>Trill</em>, his decent-enough 2005 solo debut. At the tail end of 2005, Pimp came home, and the reunited duo crafted the triumphant double album <em>Underground Kingz</em>. One of the few truly feel-good comeback stories in rap was cut short this past December when Pimp died from complications of sleep apnea. A few months later, Bun returns to the solo slog. If nothing else, <em>II Trill</em> makes for a great story of personal resilience.</p><p>
    Bun B is one of the South's great rap voices: He has a gravelly depth-charge snarl that belies a rapid-fire bounce-rap delivery and always finds a way to effortlessly blend with even the most complicated drum patterns. But solo Bun will never work anywhere near as well as UGK did. In UGK, Pimp's nasal libertine honk played counterpoint to Bun's authoritative rumble, and Pimp's crushingly humid country-funk beats gave Bun's voice focus and direction. And Pimp or no Pimp, the 2008 Bun is nowhere near as ecstatically word-drunk as he once was; no line on <em>II Trill</em> rivals this astoundingly awesome boast from 2001's ""Wood Wheel"": ""Smoking on bionic bubonic chronic, it's so ironic/ Sipping gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic."" The Bun we hear on <em>II Trill </em>is weirdly workmanlike, a technical beast without a whole lot to say beyond obligatory lines about his realness.</p><p>
    Throughout <em>II Trill</em>, Bun largely ignores the tragic context surrounding the album, preferring instead to lock into his time-tested lyrical tropes; the small army of guest-rappers on the album mentions Pimp more often than Bun does. Along with the booty-clap club-track ""Pop It 4 Pimp"", the only Pimp C eulogy here is ""Angel in the Sky"", a toothless rap&amp;b lament. Back on the first <em>Trill</em>, Bun spent six minutes on ""The Story"" directly and candidly detailing UGK's history over a hard beat without letting a chorus interrupt him. Touching as it might be, ""Angel in the Sky"" has none of that scope or specificity. Instead, Bun sounds like he's trying to cope with loss by getting back to business as usual, an understandable response but not one that makes for a terribly compelling end-to-end listen.</p><p>
    And yet <em>II Trill</em> is still a stronger album than its predecessor, largely because its producers keep things cohesive, doing their best to stay within Pimp's organic-thump blueprint, and because the guest rappers here seem to realize they're on tracks with Bun B and that they have to step their shit up accordingly. On ""Damn I'm Cold"", which should've been the first single, Bun and Lil Wayne trade wicked punchlines over Chops' swampy blues-guitar noodles and screaming organs. ""Swang on Em"" brings martial snares, horns, and a surprisingly slippery fake-Southern Lupe Fiasco cameo. On ""Get Cha Issue"", Bun uses Bigg Tyme's grimy chopped-up bar-rock track to momentarily depart from his standard block-talk, kicking nebulously political end-times proclamations (addressing elected leaders: ""Y'all some liars, stealers, philanderers and all/ Got senators sucking dick inside of bathroom stalls""). But nothing sounds as great as ""Underground Thang"", where Pimp C's disembodied voice returns, bringing with it the group chemistry and the guttural asshole charisma missing elsewhere.</p><p>
    With its near-endless running-time and its occasional misguided bids for radio-play (the thoroughly meh Sean Kingston-assisted single ""That's Gangsta"" springs to mind), <em>II Trill</em> feels like a throwback to a time when record labels were actually willing to devote resources toward recording and promoting rap albums. As such, it never quite works as a cohesive statement. But anyone expecting a world-conquering classic like UGK's 1996 <em>Ridin' Dirty</em> is demanding too much. <em>II Trill</em> is a solid and occasionally great record, an album more directed toward car-stereo utility than bedroom contemplation. At this point in his career, Bun's more than earned the right to crank out records like this whenever he wants.

    The more you think about it,
    the more ironically fitting it is that one of the biggest watershed moments in
    hip-hop history-- the controversy over sample rights and sonic appropriation-- was made by a 32-year-old TV commercial producer. Steve Stein was far from a
    dilettante; as one half of the megamix-specialist duo Double Dee and
    Steinski, he was already deep enough into the embryonic genre to change the game with his first release,
    1983's epochal sample-slayer ""Lesson 1 (The Payoff Mix)"". A track they put
    together for a remix contest (which they won handily), ""The Payoff Mix"" was a
    rework of G.L.O.B.E. &amp; Whiz Kid's ""Play That Beat Mr. DJ"" that didn't just
    wrap the Tommy Boy electro joint around the appropriate references to ""Rock It""
    and ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"", but threw in all kinds of <em>Casablanca</em>
    soundbites and dance instructor lessons and Little Richard vocals, too.
    Never mind that they weren't virtuoso DJs and actually put the whole thing
    together using an 8-track recorder and a tape deck; this took hip-hop's
    tradition of reformatting existing material and made it
    a postmodern funhouse.</p><p>
    For a generation raised on
    the 30-second educational mini-films of ""Sesame Street"" and the fleeting stimulus
    of channel surfing, Steinski's own recipe for ricocheting attention spans was a natural fit: lay down a beat, switch it up a bunch of times to keep things
    jumping, weave in a bunch of thematic, sometimes smart-assed clips of TV news
    voice-overs or political speeches, and damn the lawyers. It was already well-known how legally dicey and largely
    unreleaseable his music was back in March 1986, when critic Robert Christgau wrote a
    <em>Village Voice</em> article referring to this music with the headline ""Great Dance
    Records You Can't Buy"", but he got right to the heart of Steinski's soundbite
    technique when he dubbed him ""a perpetually disillusioned optimist who still
    assumes that the sounds and images rippling through the American consciousness
    are, forget copyright, every American's <em>birthright</em>.""</p><p>
    Not long
    afterwards, Steinski would release ""The Motorcade Sped On"", a dance record
    about the JFK assassination that was difficult to get into the American
    consciousness-- unless said American was able to subscribe to the
    <em>NME</em>, where it was given away as a flexidisc. In fact, with most of Steinski's
    material previously only available in bootleg form, the 2xCD best-of <em>What
    Does It All Mean? 1983-2006 Retrospective </em>does a great service in
    collecting all his prime material in one place-- not just the bulk of his solo
    work, but the entirety of his 2002 BBC/Solid Steel rough mix <em>Nothing to Fear</em>,
    widely considered one of the best mixes of the last several years.</p><p>
<em>Nothing to Fear </em>might be the surprise highlight of this
    collection, even accounting for all the classic stuff on the first disc. It's nice to hear Steinski do his thing for more than just a few minutes at a time,
    and at just under an hour, it's got a lot of crazy notions, elbow-ribbing
    and sharp gags packed into its running time, even as it maintains a deep focus
    on also acting as something danceable. The
    recognizable (Blackalicious' ""Swan Lake""; Nelly's ""Country Grammar""; De La
    Soul's ""The Art of Getting Jumped"") segues easily into the
    arcane; there'll be a number of times you'll hear a naggingly familiar
    yet unplaceable old-school b-boy break, and it might wind up driving you nuts. It's all bolstered by a succession of punchlines and soundbites that nudge each other out of the way even as they create a multi-generational
    stream of consciousness: there's <em>Glengarry Glen Ross,</em>
    ""Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle"", and Groucho Marx; there's preachers, comedians, and a
    self-aware drop of Louis Farrakhan exclaiming to the attendees of Jack the
    Rapper's 1980 convention that ""white people are in the business of mind
    control""; there's foley-room clips of ""Star Trek"" sound effects and pratfall bone
    fractures; there are recontextualized koans and
    truisms: ""this is a special magic,"" ""wait a minute-- are you guys actually
    gonna go through with this thing?"", ""the airwaves are sacred."" Steinski doesn't
    shy away from his elder statesman status on this mix (one semi-appalled
    ident: ""he's old enough to be my <em>father</em>!""), but the
    old-school-meets-new-school feeling makes his early-fifties age irrelevant; so
    much gets thrown at you through this mix that its allegiance to any kind of
    specific signifiers-- coasts, styles, eras, generations, anything deeper than
    ""hip-hop in general""-- is practically nil.
    </p>
<p>
    A greater insight into
    Steinski's style and sonic identity is, of course, available on the first disc,
    ranging from straight-up b-boy anthems into unnerving, borderline avant-garde
    looks into some of America's bleakest moments. By 1985 Steinski and his partner Double
    Dee had crafted two additional ""Lessons"" to augment ""The Payoff Mix"". ""Lesson 2
    (James Brown Mix)"" is self-explanatory: At a time when the 808 still ruled rap
    production, it was an unusual and prescient idea to string together a track interweaving
    some traditional hip-hop touchstones (""Apache"", ""Double Dutch Bus"") with a
    number of different fragments from several of James Brown's funk hits; all that
    remained was for the Bomb Squad to perfect the science. ""Lesson 3 (History of Hip Hop)""-- from 1985; talk about your unfinished story-- cements the historical
    import of the genre's breakbeat aspect via a smartly hijacked JFK quote (""the
    torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans""), a nod to Afrika Bambaataa's
    ""Planet Rock"" and go-to breakbeats like Dennis Coffey's ""Scorpio"" and Herman Kelly
    &amp; Life's ""Dance to the Drummer's Beat"". And the two reunion tracks that
    Double Dee and Steinski made together after over a decade apart-- 1998's
    hyperactive, elastic, almost completely transformative old-school funk-party
    remix of Bambaataa's ""Jazzy Sensation"" and 1999's quick-cutting, label-spanning
    ultramix ""Voice Mail (Sugar Hill Suite)""<span></span>-- reveal a certain giddiness over being able to work with classic
    material again.
    </p>
<p>
    But while there's plenty of strength
    in his later material-- the velvet scuzz of Coldcut-collaborative phone-sex
    pastiche ""I'm Wild About That Thing"", the sinister bop-funk of ""Vox Apostolica"",
    ""Ain't No Thing"", which expertly stitches together selections from Stones
    Throw's <em>The Third Unheard: </em><em>Connecticut</em><em> Hip-Hop 1979-1983</em> comp-- Steinski's most daring work is in controversy-courting,
    culture-jamming political needling. The juxtaposition of as-it-happens news
    clips with pop debris in ""The Motorcade Sped On""-- the intro to ""The Tonight
    Show"", the first note of the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night"", and the cowbell of
    the Rolling Stones' ""Honky Tonk Women"" slowed to a slump-shouldered skulk-- is tasteless
    in theory, but the sense of panic and confusion that Steinski puts together
    through repetition and multi-layered, often-clashing sounds manages to give it
    an unnerving gravity. 1992's ""It's Up to You (Television Mix)"" builds on a catchy loop of the Jackson 5's ""It's Great to Be Here"" and creates
    one of the few anti-Gulf War protest songs of the era, transforming Bush's
    speech into a pop hook (""Regrettably, we now believe/ That only force will make
    him leave"") and interspersing quotes from Jello Biafra (""don't hate the media, <em>become</em>
    the media!"") and Mario Savio's famous 1964 address to the Berkeley Free Speech
    Movement.
    </p>
<p>
    And then there's the last track, the previously-unreleased ""Number
    Three on Flight Eleven"", which weaves audio of Betty Ong's cell phone call from
    United Flight 11 on 9/11 into an unsettling, ambient Eno-esque dirge-- the only
    track on this compilation that's legitimately difficult to listen to. ""Lesson 2"" answered this collection's titular question with a
    quote from Fab 5 Freddy's ""Change the Beat"" (""this stuff is really fresh""), but it's also deep. And probably illegal, too, but that just makes it an essential crime.

Over a militaristic drum-and-flute backdrop, a gang of schoolkids draw some battle lines between themselves and their more mature counterparts.  Avowing that ""we are not afraid of you grown-ups,"" the girls demand access to hammers, while the boys promise to ""talk to the king of this kingdom, if you don't let us play with dolls.""  Then Merilahti comes in, her own voice betraying both the naive lilt of a little girl and a bit of the coarseness of someone a bit older-- or maybe just another kid who's been yelling too much.</p><p>
    A group of children wise enough (or maybe just fed the appropriate knowledge), to demand upended gender norms, ""Hustle"" is the perfect prologue for the Dø's debut, <em>A Mouthful</em>, an album that tries to balance the immature and the grown-up.  The Paris-based duo of Finnish expat Merilahti and French
    multi-instrumentalist Dan Levy pronounce their name ""doe,"" a reference to the alpha and omega of the musical scale, which they interpret as a license to incorporate ""what's new and what's old,"" with ""the latitude &amp; longitude to re-invigorate any musical genre.""  It's their first stab at an LP, and it's not surprising that their youthful capriciousness amazes as often as it goes astray.  The two aren't shy about toying with musical categories, but it's <em>Mouthful</em>'s wide register of emotions-- a fine actress, Merilahti does playful, frustrated, coy, fearful and romantic very well-- which compensates for the less-than-advisable inclusions, and the record is as ambitious and fun as any coming-out party in recent memory.</p><p>
    In his review last month of Wye Oak's debut <em>With Children</em>, Mike Powell wrote: ""Their sound-- earnest folk-influenced indie rock with touches of noise and dream-pop-- is so second-nature that nobody realizes it's actually endangered.""  When the Dø hit their stride on <em>A Mouthful</em>, they channel that same potent naiveté, with  Merilahti's voice as the key ingredient. Bearing a confidence and delicacy recalling Liz Phair, Mary Timony, and especially Frente's Angie Hart, Merilahti's girlish growl nestles within the gray tones of
    post-shoegaze 1990s rock.</p><p>
    To this end, Merilahti revels in lyrical contradictions, pushing her beau away forcefully with one hand while keeping a handful of his shirt in the other. In ""On My Shoulders"", she does Sisyphean work amidst swelling strings and smears of feedback, regretting her loveless labor while promising to keep at it. When she sings ""next time, I'll try it another way,"" her voice tears just enough to reveal her pain and passion-- to what end, we don't find out.  On ""The Bridge Is Broken"" her raspy melisma is endorsed by the backmasked guitars, shakers, and handclaps, creating a lush sense of romantic resignation, and a slight bit of distortion winds its way under the otherwise pristine ballad ""At Last!"", emphasizing the forlorn melody of the album's best song. Thrilled enough at finding love to walk on air for 92 hours, Merilahti stops short of gloating to her friends: ""I won't say no more, I won't make it harder on you girls."" It's rare to find a good pop song in which the singer confronts, then stops short of succumbing to pleasure.  Girl groups, Lesley Gore, and Smokey Robinson come to mind.  Sleater-Kinney, too.</p><p>
    Merilahti's emotional antagonism comes full-force on ""Stay (Just a Little Bit More)"", in which she confronts her two-faced paramour-- she's ""young, but believes in no tales""-- before getting scared and luring him back to bed.  The song, a faithful take on Lily Allen's brand of scatological ska-pop, is the strongest evidence of the Dø's penchant for generic interpretation and cross-pollination.  Elsewhere, a couple dramatic ballads (""Song for Lovers"" and ""Searching Gold""), overstay their welcome a bit, but two worldbeat bangers (""Tammie"" and the Finnish-language ""Unissasi Laulelet"") more than make up for it.  There's even an appearance from that other endangered early 90s relic, the goofy pop-rap one-off:  ""Queen Dot Kong"" would have made a swell B-side, but bundled on the LP it juts out awkwardly.  Within<em> A Mouthful</em>'s over-swelled 69-minute (!) runtime is a wonderful 48-minute album; the excess material isn't unlistenable by any stretch, but it does suggest the need for a bit more quality control.  It will require Merilahti and Levy to re-prioritize how they use their youthful exuberance--  from all-inclusive tracklists to more wonderful songs like ""At Last!"" and ""On My Shoulders"". It's a bit paternal-sounding, I know.  For the time being, then, let's let them have fun.<br/>

But as fun as it is to seek out all the different timbres and tonal possibilities on offer, you could spend a pretty satisfying lifetime just listening to all the ways a single instrument can be used a re-employed in different contexts and by different players. Hell, you could probably spend a lifetime just building a thorough understanding of all the ways the piano is used in jazz.</p><p>
    Take a trawl back through the instrument's recorded history in the genre, and you'll find all kinds of approaches-- a knowledgeable listener will never mistake the swirling, busy style of Art Tatum for Thelonious Monk's dissonant, strangely twisting improvisations, for instance. In the jazz world, it's a fight for every musician to carve out his or her own little instrumental niche, to find that thing as a musician that makes them distinct. Some never do, others constantly change in a search for their style, and still others are just born to sound like no one but themselves.</p><p>
    It's not a stretch to put Vijay Iyer in that final category. Iyer has a very unique approach to comping chords, constantly moving back and forth between notes in the chord to create a throbbing background pulse. It's more a sheet of sound than traditional jazz piano. You'll hear it used as an effect frequently in jazz, but it's rare that this textural technique becomes the center of a player's style, and it's made Iyer's playing uniquely suited to crossing the thin lines between jazz and hip-hop to collaborate with indie hip-hop auteur Mike Ladd.
    </p><p>
    Along with his two headlining collaborations with Ladd, Iyer's helmed or co-helmed a dozen LPs-- he stretches his style in every direction imaginable, and his compositions tend to mix moody textural passages with bursts of odd rhythm, some that even sound like riffs. Modern jazz rarely follows the old ""head/solos/head"" format that typified be-bop, and Iyer uses his compositions as mood pieces, setting them against each other in a bid to change the feeling the record produces from song to song.
    </p>
<p>
    He has a versatile band in saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, bassist Stephan Crump, and drummer Marcus Gilmore, who flow right along with him and easily handle the odd meters and start-stops he gives them. The album creeps into being with the nebulous, slowly coalescing ""The Weight of Things"" (it's an open improv credited to the whole group) before exploding into a full-on lurch on ""Macaca Please"". Mahanthappa does some of his most ferocious lead playing on this track, though he outclasses himself later in the album on ""Without Lions"", where his sax line practically sounds like a jazz take on ""Flight of the Bumblebee"". 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Tragicomic</em>, true to its title, is an album about balance-- see the way, for example, that Iyer follows the buoyant sunny ""I'm All Smiles"" with the evil, odd-metered stormer ""Machine Days""-- and what rises from nothing at the beginning dissipates again into nothing again with the final track. It's the end note to a satisfying album from a unique pianist who continues to show us what his instrument can do.

Never mind why a mariachi band would be performing for an unconscious gringo in the first place, especially since they seem surprised when he opens his eyes. The point's been made: if you're lying in the dirt beaten and bloody, is there anything you'd like to wake up to less than a mariachi band blaring away in your face?</p><p>
    Again, it's a cheap gag, as Mexico's got one of the most vibrant music scenes in the world, from traditional mariachi music to Mexico City's <em>rock en español</em> contingent, the latter known for bridging the country's rich musical heritage with more modern sounds and strains. From the start, that's been the similar goal of Nortec Collective, whose name conflates the words ""norteno"" and ""techno,"" and whose music pairs manic accordion, trumpet, and bajo sexto with samples and electronic beats. Unfortunately, most of the songs on the group's <em>Nortec Collective Presents: Bostich + Fussible-- Tijuana Sound Machine</em> only fitfully fuse the traditional with the modern, and the problem sure isn't the acoustic instrumentation. If anything, there's not enough of the traditional in what often sounds like a Casio demo gone amuck, and the gimmick-- transforming accordions and horns into rhythmic tools-- feels, in fact, somewhat cheap.</p><p>
    But what really hurts <em>Tijuana Sound Machine</em> is its relentlessly uninventive and static electronic flourishes, Nortec Collective's ostensible claim to fame. Wan ditties like ""Brown Bike"" and ""Wanted"", or the outright annoying ""Shake It Up"" make the mistakes not normally associated with the loose-in-numbers but still tightly aligned members of the Collective, who in the past have skirted novelty. Here, on the other hand, with members Bostich (Ramon Amezcua) and Fussible (Pepe Mogt) taking the lead, track after track bleats out like an alarm clock from hell, less likely to call you to the dance floor than make you clutch that pillow tighter around your ears. </p><p>
    ""Mi Casita"", ""Akai 47"", and ""Mama Loves Nortec"" are nominally hip novelties, but novelties all the same, though the latter does finally allow the trumpet to shine through as more than just accent or afterthought. Of course, the relentless polka beat is a genre mainstay, but just as other dance music makes the most of 4/4, surely there's room for a little variation. Even when a track like ""Cetron"" briefly teeters toward an exciting bustle befitting its urban inspiration, it feels reigned in, over-quantized, safe and sterile. And generally speaking, if there's one thing Tijuana is not, it's safe and sterile.</p></div>"|11544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11544-tijuana-sound-machine/|3.8|Joshua Klein

Their first couple of records, while     leaning just on this side of minimal tech-house, always shuffled in and out of     drunk-step, taking nonsensical barroom lyrics and mixing them in with various     jazz-inflected reed instruments, steam-machine hi-hats, and pounding basslines.     On <i>Craft Sounds and Voices</i> and 2006's <i>How To Dance</i>, it's never     quite clear whether they're poised cosmopolitan producers or just a drink away     from Gainsbourg-hitting-on-Whitney-Houston. Early last year, their <i>Remember     Love</i> 12"" dropped and signaled a move even further out of the club, the     pulse of a deep house groove pummeled into a piano line, an effete yet     fully-formed <i>song</i> about fucking around on your sig-oh.</p>
<p>The     piano figures heavily on <i>Songs on the Rocks</i>, almost to the point of     parody, but this is still as complete an artist album as any released on Get     Physical in recent memory. Those stylistic tweaks employed for the sake of     ""songiness"" on ""Remember Love"" have been blueprinted into     long form, with pianos and guitars filling the timbral space once gobbled up by     synthesized squelches and samples; actual verse-chorus-verse dynamic shifts and     turn-of-the-century French folk play themselves out into the ether of minimal     beats. Nico and Ezechiel have always gotten off on contributing their own     singsong vocals, but they've gone from adding simple hooks and vocal grooves to     penning fully-formed lyrics. Nico utilizes a peculiar cabaret growl (made     popular elsewhere by Man Man's Honus Honus or Tom Waits) whenever he wrests     control of the mic, but otherwise the two harmonize catchy little ditties in     their awkward French-accented lilts. Immediately following the timpani-driven     beats (!!) of ""L'Inconnu Du Placard"", the pair also bring some star     power into ""Danse Avec Moi"" in the form of Dani Siciliano's duet with     French singer David Lafore on a piano laced techno-tango.</p>
<p>It     certainly seems like Nôze chose the right time to aim for accessibility.     They've gained more than their share of exposure lately due to the <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series, having been featured on back-to-back mixes by Hot Chip and Booka Shade.     The latter features this record's ""Slum Girl"", but as is often the     case with <i>DJ-Kicks</i>, Booka Shade make a happy decision of taste in     editing out Nico's vocals. Here's the problem: ""Slum Girl"" as Booka     Shade sees it is a dramatic, expansive orchestral work, one that in their hands     recalls the vivacious cinematic minimalism of Alain Goraguer's score to the     classic animated sci-fi film <i>La Planète Sauvage</i>. To Nico, it's a vehicle     for him to growl a double of the guitar line, in effect lessening the impact of     the composition. Nico better services the classic rock postures of     ""Childhood Blues"", where it's actually appropriate to invoke the     self-effacing impotence of British blues-rock.</p>
<p>A     short, balladized take on <i>How To Dance</i>'s ""Kitchen"" closes the     record, fittingly distilling the original's hard-partying, come-hither hoedown     into a refreshing stab at solemnity. Of course, they're singing ""I'll make     you come/ All night long,"" but then, actual gravitas might be asking too     much. Because while they may be the jet-setting, free lovin' Frenchmen they     want everyone to think they are, their song-based oeuvre seems even more suited     to pounding a night out at the local 17th District dive than wooing high-class     sophisticates. Either way, you'll just have to trust them.</p></div>"|11509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11509-songs-on-the-rocks/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

Now, unbound from the shackles of corporate pressure, the Sunderland band finally has a chance to spread its wings, to enjoy the sort of creative freedom artists like Radiohead or NIN have relished, to boldly chase its muse to the ends of the earth. Ladies and gentlemen, the Futureheads present <em>This Is Not the World</em>, an...economy-size power-pop album?</p><p>
    Apparently the backlash from <em>Tributes </em>hasn't scared the band away from penning three-minute pop standards; it's only convinced them to package their songs in a neater, more cohesive fashion. Miffed by <em>Tributes</em>'<em> </em>acoustic guitar sighs and less-than-syncopated textures? Well, <em>World </em>force-feeds the listener with one heaping helping of homogeneous overdriven riffs and fist-pumping choruses after another. The vocals similarly raise the stakes, broadening their focus from the tearfully quotidian to blistering anthems attacking society on the whole, likely a byproduct of their recent career shakeup. Opener ""The Beginning of the Twist"" may ostensibly refer to a romantic relationship, but Barry Hyde's rallying cry (""It's time to wake up/ It's time to change"") feels like snarky self-commentary, foreshadowing the in-your-face persona the band's adopted on <em>World</em>.</p><p>
    Since their self-titled debut, the Futureheads have gone from crafting intricate, mathematical post-punk with a pop edge to crafting full-blown power-pop with a hint of Elvis Costello/Ric Ocasek geek chic. Missing here are most of the Wire and XTC signifiers and the ADD songwriting that fired off one robotic riff after another with Pentium processor precision, verse/chorus structure be damned. The sweeping power chords of songs like ""Think Tonight"" and the title track will betray nearly every preconception you've had of this band. Not only do these tracks stick to conventional song structures, they even go as far as to anticipate their massive sing-along refrains with dramatic intros and pre-choruses. I haven't checked, but it's likely many of these songs, especially the handful with avalanche-style descending major scale riffs, synch up eerily well with Cheap Trick's ""Surrender"".</p><p>
    Fortunately, just because the hooks are swollen doesn't mean they're not catchy as hell. While neither as frenetic as the group's debut or as stylistically curious as <em>Tributes</em>, <em>World </em>boasts smart pop sensibilities all the same. ""Broke Up the Time"" is an unashamed carousel ride around an ultra-sunny riff, not any more guilty than a tongue-in-cheek song like R.E.M.'s ""Stand"". ""Sale of the Century"" grinds down a herky-jerky Go4 groove until it's as palatable as a harmless Franz Ferdinand ditty, while standout track ""Radio Heart"" represents the best possible outcome for the band's new artistic direction. Pinching the meaty guitar slabs from 2006 single ""Skip to the End"", the track's skewed chord progression and galloping melody make for three minutes of near pop perfection, replete with a Pygmalion-esque confluence of art and love, ""a girl with a radio heart."" Hyde's lyrics are especially gripping considering how his band's toils somewhere between abstract, cerebral post-punk and mainstream rock, never quite mortgaging one for greater success in the other.</p><p>
    The sad truth, though, is that the Futureheads were never a band that got by solely on hooks, but rather their unorthodox delivery of them. Aside from their endearing Sunderland accents, they've 86'd every ace previously kept up their sleeve. Without the quad-approved a cappella harmonies, explosive stop-start melodies, and edge-of-seat rhythms, these guys can't distinguish themselves quite so clearly from the UK's post-punk hoi polloi anymore. Maybe it's just the subliminal suggestion of the group's moniker, or a revisionist nostalgia for their debut's slap-in-the-face urgency, but <em>World </em>feels sadly complacent coming from a band that once wielded so much restless, forward-thinking innovation. Hopefully the plodding nature of this album means the band's simply stabilizing after some label turmoil, and not, as the weakest parts of <em>World </em>suggest, already running on empty.</p></div>"|11556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11556-this-is-not-the-world/|6.2|Adam Moerder

    some money from an album that sounds like this, it might as well be 
    Al Green himself. The Greatest Living Soul Singer is 62 years old now, 
    and age has thickened his voice, but miraculously hasn't damaged it 
    much; he's still got immaculate power and control, all the way up to 
    that extraordinary falsetto. In fact, he sounds better this time than 
    on his last few albums: less short of breath, getting texture out of 
    the slighty worn patches in his range instead of trying to cover them 
    up with shouting (aside from the throwaway closer ""Standing in 
    the Rain""). The production team (and half of the band) is the Roots' 
    Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson and James Poyser, who manage to 
    evoke the supple groove of Green's early-70s collaborations with producer 
    Willie Mitchell more precisely than Mitchell himself did on 2003's <em>
    I Can't Stop</em> and 2005's <em>Everything's OK</em>. The arrangements, 
    the mix, Poyser's Hammond organ tone, ?uest's drumming, the string sweetening-- everything 
    is pure second-term-Nixon sound. (The horn section is the Dap-Kings 
    Horns, who may be the only people who've maintained that particular 
    tradition.) Even the major-minor changeups in a bunch of the songs are 
    the same trick Green and Mitchell pulled off on songs like ""Here 
    I Am (Come and Take Me)"".</p><p>
    So be it: the great Al Green 
    records all sound like this, and the less great ones don't, so by inference 
    making an Al Green record that evokes 1973 gives it a better shot. Put 
    it on in the background and it's as gorgeous as <em>Let's Stay Together</em> 
    or <em>Livin' for You</em>. But there's something unsettlingly nostalgic 
    and hollow about <em>Lay It Down</em> that comes to the surface when you 
    listen closely to it. The problem isn't just that there's no sign that 
    hip-hop ever happened, aside from ?uestlove's breakbeat-inflected drumming 
    in ""You've Got the Love I Need"" and the slightly Fugees-oid 
    groove of ""Stay With Me (By the Sea)"". Despite the guest shots 
    by Green disciples Anthony Hamilton and John Legend, both of whom get 
    shown up by the master, this isn't a neo-soul record, it's a straight 
    old-school soul record.</p><p>
    The hole in the middle of the 
    album is, in fact, Jesus-shaped. Green's Christianity was always an 
    enormous presence in his music, even before he gave up secular singing 
    for a while; his constant awareness of mortality and divinity is what 
    raised the stakes on his love songs. His best album, <em>Call Me</em>, 
    followed ""You Ought to Be With Me"" with ""Jesus Is Waiting"", 
    and the ever-present tension between the sacred and the secular on his 
    records came to a head on 1977's ""Belle"": ""It's you that 
    I want, but it's Him that I need"".
    </p><p>
    There's none of that here-- the 
    closest Green comes is singing about ""a love divine"" on ""Too 
    Much"", and he doesn't really mean ""divine."" Instead, 
    we get flabby romantic couplets (""You're the best thing I ever 
    had/ Losing you, that would make me feel so bad""; ""Your love 
    is more than true, oh baby/ It's just, it's just for me and you""). 
    There's no desire here for a person (or a God) that Green wants to bring 
    closer to himself, just an appreciation of someone he's already got. 
    Yes, it's a pleasure to hear Green articulate 
    romantic satisfaction, and good for him if he's satisfied. But the grain 
    and pull of his voice is all about longing for both flesh and spirit, 
    and it doesn't quite fit here. Green's classic records were never just 
    baby-making music, and without a context greater than a shared bedroom, 
    this precise reconstruction of their sound is a ritual that's lost a 
    lot of its meaning.

<em>Desert Crossroads</em> couldn't be a more apt title for Niamey,
    Niger's Etran Finatawa. This sextet's potent, trance-y ""nomadic blues""
    is a blend of two West-Central African ethnic groups-- the
    Tuareg and the Wodaabe peoples-- who historically have lived in the south
    Sahara and Sahel grasslands. The band itself is a crossroad, not only
    in its novel and successful attempt at mixing the two distinct musical
    strains (vocals are in the Wodaabe style while the pronounced guitar
    and hand-drum grooves are steeped in Tuareg rhythms), but also since
    the group features three representatives from each tribe.</p><p>
    Etran Finatawa represent two groups that
    have both traditionally wandered to where the water and pastures took
    them, sadly not always free of conflict over these essential resources.
    The other obvious ""crossroads"" analogy comes in with the themes of the
    music which address the trials and tribulations common to both ethnic groups, primarily due
    to the erosion of their cultural traditions and loss of their lands.
    Desertification is driving many people to the cities where the old ways
    are being forgotten, but still longed for.</p><p id=""got21"">
    Granted, this English-speaking writer couldn't glean all that from the
    Tamashek (Tuareg) or Fulfulde (Wodaabe) languages that Etran sing in
    for this sophomore release, but there is a beautiful earnestness that,
    even during more uptempo and joyous numbers like the circular vamp
    ""Amidinine"", reveals a composed seriousness. This track isn't the only one that hypnotically and repetitively explores the churning bluesy
    guitar spiral-- pretty much the whole record displays this signature of
    Kel Tamasheck (a name the Tuareg call themselves) music. 
    </p>
<p id=""got21"">
    These
    trilling, slurring, serpentine guitar lines are most prominent in the
    internationally-renowned Tuareg band Tinariwen, who are the reason that
    many Tuareg musicians made the switch to electric guitar back in the 1970s. Where Tinariwen spin their desert blues with strong rock
    overtones-- wah-wah on the six-string, pronounced electric bass lines--
    Etran keep things more traditional. Guitars may be electric, but the
    tone is clean; and the infrequent bass is far less featured. Though the
    dexterous, cobwebbed guitars have an affinity towards contemporary
    Afropop, the essential throbbing drones and implied bass lines are pure
    blues. (One can also hear this African/American Delta blues
    connection in the style of Malian
    guitarist Ali Farka Touré.) 
    </p>
<p id=""got22"">
    Two songs that reveal a pronounced Wodaabe influence are ""Gaynaako"" and
    ""Naanaaye"". Both use call-and-response vocals-- nasally and wailing with
    alternately smoothly-subdued replies-- that intertwine over a
    pulsing, clip-clop of percussion and hand-claps (besides the
    polyphonic and contrapuntal vocal-style, hand-claps are key to the
    Wodaabe sound.) These are extremely evocative and enticing tunes rich
    with the melding of both tribesmen, especially considering the
    shifting landscape and cross-cultural exchange they borrow from,
    including various sub-Saharan cultures, West African influences,
    Berber, Arabic,
    and even the subtle hint of contemporary Western rock. Afropop
    fans and world music buffs wishing to broaden their palette
    should experience Etran's genius musical nomadism.

    This album makes me feel old: last time I rember there being a <em>Live at Royal Albert Hall</em>, it came
    from Spiritualized, less than a year off the strength of their
    American breakthrough.  If you were in my freshman
    dorm in 1998, well, I don't apologize for trying to push <em>Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space </em>on you.  And now, a decade later, Cinematic Orchestra
    has their very own <em>Live at the Royal
    Albert Hall </em>less than a year removed from <em>their </em>American breakthrough: an episode of ""Grey's Anatomy"" that had my
    fiancée asking if I had an mp3 of ""To Build a Home"".</p><p>
    This album might make <em>you
    </em>feel old, too: when you take into account the kind of stuff Cinematic
    Orchestra did before <em>Ma Fleur </em>on
    Ninja Tune (not to mention Portishead's <em>Third</em>),
    you might start thinking that there's enough seedlings for a trip-hop revival,
    the sorta-genre that was roundly mocked even when it supposedly existed.   Though they only got started in the late 1990s, they still kinda fit in-- if you're unfamiliar with these guys, they're
    possibly the easiest band to review because their two most fitting adjectives
    are contained within the band name itself.  And while this serves as a decent, but unbalanced (in terms of album representation) Cinematic Orchestra sampler, it's also a throwback to the downtempo lifestyle music that labels were all too happy to throw cash at in the post-<em>Dummy</em> sweepstakes.  And I don't think I need to remind you that for every ""6 Underground"", you got <em>Formica Blues</em> five times over.</p><p>
    Portishead is actually worth keeping in mind, since they
    made a similar release with <em>PNYC: Roseland NYC Live</em>, a curtain-revealing look at a band previously known for its
    hermetic nature and shying away from concert performance.  No expense was spared-- leader Jason Swinscoe outfitted Cinematic Orchestra with an army of vocalists, a 24-piece orchestra, and a venue that
    arguably belies their profile.  It's an
    unyieldingly classy recording, its rich and sparkling tone impervious to shitty
    earbuds, car stereos, and computer speakers. 
    Play it on a high-class hi-fi and gold coins will shoot out of your
    speakers.  This is particularly true of
    the jazzier numbers; ""Child Song"" shifts from 7/4 to 5/4 without making a big
    fuss about it, and Swinscoe's DJing is seamlessly incorporated towards the
    end.  ""Man With the Movie Camera""
    doesn't fare quite as well, even though there's a pretty neat drum solo in the middle,
    as well as some free-time horn/turntablism noise providing the most avant-garde
    moment.  But it's hard to recommend multiple
    listens with its forbidding, nearly 12-minute run time.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Live </em>would've been
    just fine as opulent sonic wallpaper, but the reason <em>Ma Fleur </em>was such a bore is even more pronounced in this form, in
    particular, Swinscoe's choice of vocalists. 
    Surprisingly enough, his calling card gets the most subtle seasoning;
    the studio version of ""To Build a Home"" felt like the result of Swinscoe stuck
    off the realness of <em>I Am a Bird Now </em>and
    thinking, ""piece of piss, how hard could it be?""  Here, it's stripped of most of the soppy
    melodrama and turned into something that approaches <em>Astral Weeks </em>in terms of pastoral acoustic and sympathetic string
    use (not to mention, a bit of ramble).  
    </p>
<p>
    But otherwise, Swinscoe has the unfortunate preference for
    full-blast divas.  You know, the type
    where merely singing ""How near?"" isn't enough when you could say ""HOW NEAR? <em>hownearhownearhownearhownear</em>"" in an
    overly dramatic melisma.  Swinscoe has
    unsurprisingly gone on record saying how each of their songs is supposed to
    accompany an unwritten movie, but the vocal numbers tend to be both slight and
    overbearing; a film with this much telegraphed emotion would be impossible to stomach for even the most chick-flick hardened.    
    </p>
<p>
    Not that it's ever unpleasant on record, but goddamn--
    doesn't this make you feel old?  Used to
    be this sort of thing (trip-hop or not) was meant to accompany druggy sex or sexy drugs, or at
    the very least, some sort of noir danger or last-call malaise.  At this point, it's the new soundtrack to
    cocktail hour, and everyone's the designated driver.

    Pacific Northwest musician
    and artist Phil Elverum, aka Mount Eerie, writes around tactile
    sensations. In his better incarnation, Microphones, song titles such as ""The Pull"", ""I Felt Your Shape"", ""Ice"", and ""Sand (Eric's Trip)"" conjure elements of motion and
    texture. Those were songs with
    seasick dynamics: booms and flicks; hard, lumbering drums; and Elverum's
    soft voice. Willful
    amateurism is the other defining characteristic of Elverum's
    career, in ways both admirable (the care and dedication he shows in
    packaging and releasing his own material) and silly (this EP comes with
    a bootleg of the track list, played
    live, and captured by a tape recorder held up to a PA).
    Sometimes that amateurism has given off the distinct impression that
    Elverum's not trying very hard, but he's had plenty of bright spots, too. This release is one of them.</p><p id=""px1114"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
<em>Black Wooden Ceiling Opening</em> is the
    first of
    Elverum's experiments in ""black metal using natural materials.""
    Despite his claims to genre-hopping, this six-song EP isn't so
    different from his other
    releases. For one thing, three of the tracks have seen light on other
    albums, though in different forms (something he also attempted in 2005
    when he reworked songs on <em>""Singers""</em>).
    But even the new tracks fit his discography, though with mealier textures
    and darker tones.</p><p id=""px1117"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    The album's best track is one of the older ones. ""Don't Smoke""-- originally released on a limited 7""-- makes good on its title: Elverum
    doesn't want you to smoke. Though his argument is sincere, his reasons
    are a bit flimsy: You smoke
    because ""there's a little part of you that wants to be dead"" or maybe
    because ""the rebellion against the adults hasn't ended yet."" The guitar
    is more furious than his pleas, and it's the tension and crash of the music that make
    this the EP's standout. 
    </p>
<br/>
    ""Blue Light on the Floor"" is another makeover. The first version, from 2007's <em>Mount Eerie Pts. 6 &amp; 7</em>,
    shimmers and flexes; cymbals and low organ drones ebb and flow behind
    his voice. The <em>Black Wooden Ceiling Opening</em> version eschews scenery for action and powerful exhales of gut-rumbling distortion.
    There are some real, menacingly fast intakes of breath from Elverum,
    too, which reinforce the aggression. And the double-tracked vocals fit
    the song's muscular makeover more than they do the earlier version, which ends with the same gruff textures that you'll find on <em>Black Wooden Ceiling Opening</em>. Maybe Elverum had planned this version from the beginning. <br/>
<p id=""px1120"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Plain, literal, naked, on closer ""Stop
    Singing"" Elverum sings: ""If I stopped bellowing my voice in
    the void/ I would notice songs that all around
    me sing."" Like a smoker, Elverum's compulsion to keep going trumps his
    own best interests-- when he recognizes that compulsion is when he's at
    his best, though his recent output hasn't topped his Microphones work.
    But Elverum's experiment is less about moving forward than mulling
    over. Restlessness or laziness, who knows. But as Mount Eerie, he can
    rework his material in a way that makes it meatier but still tactile,
    more aggressive yet as emotionally understated and gentle as his voice.

What makes his debut full-length so appealing is that it matches both descriptions. Leone mixes crafty melody with digital wizardry so smoothly, it's hard to say where one side of his musical personality ends and the other begins. A frequent rock critic (primarily for Pitchfork), Leone has wide range in both taste and background (his press kit calls him ""classically trained""). But <em>Dominique Leone</em> doesn't sound like a collection of influences, a sampling of references, or a compendium of ideas. It's impressively organic, with detailed compositions that neither hide artifice nor flaunt it. Leone seems to have eyes in the back of his head, watching pop history while pushing it forward.</p><p>
    The pop history Leone prefers could roughly be described as groups infatuated with sugary melodies, and using the studio to craft and enhance them. Think Beatles, Beach Boys, and ELO, up through Todd Rundgren, XTC, and ABBA. But Leone's buoyant tunes and high-pitched voice are more than mimicry. For every song that sounds like P<em>et Sounds </em>or <em>Skylarking</em>, there's one that conjures less-predictable comparisons. I often hear the helium-injected whine of Mark Davies of Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 in Leone's singing, and other listeners will find their own touchstones, making <em>Dominique Leone</em> a kind of electro-pop mood ring whose day-glo hues change with each listen.</p><p>
    Leone opens the album with a few seconds of his voice run backwards. This might be the only instance where his singing stands alone-- usually he buries it under layers of sound and processing. But his voice is the center of each tune, and it allows him to make active mixes that never get overly busy, since they're always based on simple vocal melodies. On the delirious ""Sim"", hyper synths whir past his chorused croons, while in ""Duyen"" radio samples and ringing phones rhyme with his Jeff Lynne-style hums. The effect is often funny, and even goofy-- take the most contagious piece, ""Nous Tombons Dans Elle"", which sounds like a club track, a Dr. Demento remix, and a Japanese TV ad rolled into one. There are also moments of noise and abstraction, reflecting Leone's love of figures as divergent as Debussy, Harry Nilsson, and the Boredoms.</p><p>
    Still, the majority of <em>Dominique Leone</em> is sunny pop, and as such suffers a bit from over-consistency. The brightness can become a blinding glare-- skip randomly around the album and it's hard to remember which tune is which. But if the cost of hearing Leone hone his fertile musical approach is a little tedium, that's a fair price to pay. Especially when the reward is the album-ending ""Conversational"", an aching Beatles-esque ballad that serves as an open-ended farewell on a record worth staying in touch with.</p></div>"|11546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11546-dominique-leone/|7.5|Marc Masters

    Like Ford trucks, Detroit
    beatmaker/MC Black Milk uses dependability as a selling point.  His 2007 debut, <em>By Popular Demand</em>, was one of the year's most consistent, if not terribly
    innovative, rap records, and he's arguably the brightest star in the post-Dilla
    Fat Beats/Stones Throw constellation; you'd be hard-pressed to find a wack
    beat with his name attached to it. 
    However, there was something of a telling moment thrown into the
    extravagant instrumentation of ""Luvin' It"", namely Milk uttering, ""This is the shit
    I wanna make, man.""  Since major-label
    hip-hop is about as financially stable as mixed martial arts or original
    internet programming, even the bigger names have gone underground, but is the
    basement getting too crowded?</p><p>
    Like most producer/MC double-bills,
    <em>The Set Up </em>traffics in lowered
    expectations so as to let either party go off on a tangent that might otherwise
    be considered too curveball on a <em>real </em>release.  For those looking for <em>Popular-er Demand</em>, Milk lays out his cards in quick fashion-- the
    wildly flanged ""Lookout"" comes out of nowhere, a Diwali-ish club rumbler
    straight off of <em>So Addictive </em>(albeit
    without a particularly sturdy hook). 
    It's even more glaring sandwiched between the relentless<em> Ironman </em> boom of ""Flawless"" and ""Bad Man"", so mid-1990s,
    you probably need to wear 40 Below Timbs and  Triple Fat Goose just to fully appreciate it.</p><p>
    From there on out, it's more
    along the lines of what we've come to expect from one of the most tireless
    producers working right now: weeping soul samples (""Nothing To Hide""), dusty
    breakbeats, the occasional string loop, the Foreign Exchange-on-HGH of ""Take
    Control""-- it all sounds pretty fantastic. 
    What ties most of these tracks together is Milk's shattering, presently
    anomalous drum work.  Be honest with
    yourself; between Kanye West popularizing chamber pop and European club techno
    and the prominence of southern synth merchants, when was the last time you
    heard a drum track <em>knock</em>?        
    </p>
<p>
    But if there was a reason why <em>Popular Demand </em>was really good instead of great, it's an issue of
    what some would call consistency and the more skeptical listeners would call
    complacency.  Maybe it's just projection
    on my part, but there seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy of ""real hip-hop""
    superiority due to the mere fact that they're rappin' on Music House about
    something other than the sort of topics that are deemed taboo on Okayplayer. Though
    clearly ambitious  behind the boards,
    Milk and nearly everyone else don't seem all that interested in challenging
    themselves lyrically or revealing what makes them tick other than a metronome.  Clocking in at nearly 40 minutes, <em>The Set Up </em>was likely meant as snack
    food, but as much as it can sate the listener, its impact doesn't last very
    long beyond the tantalizing proposition of what more versatile rhymers could've
    done with it.     
    </p>
<p>
    In terms of flow, the main characters are certainly nice
    with theirs: Milk can be likened to Kanye with baggier clothes, and as for Fat
    Ray, he sounds like someone who learned the craft by listening to Re-Up Gang
    tapes and fast-forwarding through the Clipse. 
    But whether it's coke puns or B+ battle raps, refusing to ever leave
    your comfort zone can only result in diminishing returns.  The two are hardly subpar on the mic, but
    they stay in cruise control to the point where you only notice the speed bumps
    (mostly coming from Fat Ray)--  ""better make
    room like Fiddy's crib,"" ""we don't smoke squares, n***a-- rectangles,"" ""you see
    how we stack chips like Chester Cheetah."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Taken as a full experience, <em>The Set Up </em>ends up as a great beat tape and a pretty good full experience
    that, in a sneaky way, seems to dismiss the talents of the people involved.  While Guilty Simpson does a pretty good job
    of roughing up his sixteen bars on ""Bad Man"", Beanie Sigel might've dug 'em a
    deep grave.  What about finding the cave
    MF Doom is hiding in to lace up the syrupy keys on ""When It Goes Down""?  There's more than enough in Black Milk's
    track record that justifies him wanting to work with the best and having the
    best seek him out.  And he may just be a
    part of something truly great in the future, but he'll have to decide whether
    his name will be on the spine or in the credits.

    Indian Jewelry's debut album, <em>Invasive Exotics</em>, dropped at exactly the right time-- about six months after Liars' <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>. The album proved a worthy footnote to the Year Indie Rock Cared About Tribal-y Drone-y Things, an addendum for those not about to dig through the Einstürzende Neubauten catalog. But be exactly as skeptical of the band's sophomore album <em>""Free Gold!""</em> as you would anything bearing its title: the Houston/Chicago troupe has swallowed itself whole, submitting its already over-serious barnacle-rock to swarming electronics and pedantic sloganeering. Scattered salvations are offered via surprisingly varied songwriting, but <em>""Free Gold!""</em> contains neither the levity nor inspired anger to buoy its industrial-grade sludge.</p><p>
    Like its predecessor, <em>""Free Gold!""</em> still sounds the product of its influences. Making a police lineup out of them isn't useful, but suffice to say Indian Jewelry probably knows what they're up to naming the lead track ""Swans"". Standard garage and trance-rock tags still apply, and while Indian Jewelry have disappointingly phased out their grooves there's plenty variety to be had: dangling guitar-pop, West Coast psychedelia, ambient blissout. But Indian Jewelry seem to relish applying a layer of gristle and fat to each of these styles, heaping on distended guitar, buzzkill synths, and all other manner of electronic distraction that generally sounds like a cloud of mosquitoes blotting out the sun. Add to this a newfound love of chant and Indian Jewelry zero out most of their versatility before it has a chance to show.</p><p>
    The mantras range from the relatively harmless ""That bird is broke/ That bird won't sing"" to the outright bizarre and, more pressingly, disastrous: during the croaking dirge of ""Hello Africa"" the band circles around ""Hello Africa/ Hello Af-ri-ca/ Hell Africa/ Hello Hello."" ""Too Much Honkytonking"" lives up to its title if we presume that by ""honkytonking"" the band means ""rallying around a big distorto-riff, caveman tom hits, and a virally irritating, meaningless phrase."" Later in the song the lyrics get switched up: ""Too much honky-everything,"" a turn so elementary and internet-clever the sound of your eyes rolling back in their sockets actually drowns out the succeeding bars.</p><p>
<em>
    ""Free Gold!""</em> also suffers from poor construction. Whereas <em>Invasive Exotics</em> seemed to adopt a krautrock album structure-- one monolith and a handful of smaller pills-- <em>""Free Gold!"" </em>veers into excess, featuring 14 busy, heaving constructions. This girth masks some perky compositional style-hopping. Obvious standout ""Everyday"" features the reverberated voice of keyboardist/guitarist Erika Thrasher pining over chunky acoustic chords; the effect is so pleasantly disorienting that it's worth wondering if Jefferson Airplane wouldn't be a better role model for Indian Jewelry than, say, early Butthole Surfers or Suicide. ""Pompeii"" hints at jangle pop, like Galaxie 500 under years of dust. ""Swans"" and ""Temporary Famine Ship"" both aspire to a grandiosity atypical of drone rock. ""Overdrive"" is icy and distant, but optimistically so. ""Bird Is Broke (Won't Sing)"", in addition to the recent re-release of early work <em>We Are the Wild Beasts</em> (under the NTX + Electric moniker) affirms that the band's repeated use of animal imagery is among its most consistent and endearing traits.  </p><p>
    These fleeting successes lend credence to the idea that Indian Jewelry-- who dress in headrobes and bring rifles to their photo shoots and probably spend as much time <strong><a href=""http://www.nowwearefree.com/indianjewelry.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing press releases</a></strong> as lyrics-- are a much better idea than they are band. Their  suffocate under the specter of momentless four-minute slugs like ""Walking on the Water"" and ""Seasonal Economy"". Someone should buy Indian Jewelry better drugs, or perhaps funner drugs, or maybe just a Calvin and Hobbes collection: something, anything to ensure that someone cracks a smile during the band’s next recording session. Or more importantly, the next time someone listens to their record because <em>""Free Gold!""</em> is entirely too weighted, emotionally and sonically.  <br/></p></div>"|11512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11512-free-gold/|5.2|Andrew Gaerig

    There are worse fates for sure, but Delays ultimately are a
    band that's far easier to love than to take seriously.  <em>Faded
    Seaside Glamour </em>and <em>You See Colours </em>were
    overlooked albums of gorgeous, sun-stroked pop that was equally informed by
    dance and shoegaze, often and rather accurately likened to a Cocteaus/La's
    crossbreed.  But there's so much about
    them that comes across as earnest to the point of unintentional silliness-- in
    no particular order, their videos, their lyrics, and their haircuts.  And even if Greg Gilbert's voice is an
    astonishing instrument, he sounds like a woman half the time, and when he tries
    to grit it up in the lower registers, he suspiciously sounds like a Bonus
    Jonas.</p><p id=""lcfk8"">
    That's actually relevant to the discussion, because I used
    to wonder how ""Valentine"" or ""Hey Girl"" could fall under the radar in
    the
    golden age of Poptimism, when grown men are falling over themselves
    trying to unearth the ""genius"" in Disney pop outside of its marketing.
    But after hearing ""When You Look Me In The Eyes"" while getting my hair
    cut
    and then ""One More Lie In"" and ""Keep It Simple"" in the car immediately
    afterwards... well, the two might actually be playing the same game at
    this point. Bet you can't tell which is penning these lyrics:
    ""I love you/ I'll pick the leaves from trees above you."" ""I know what
    haunts you/ And you need to know
    I want you."" ""You need to try
    today/ Because these things don't go away.""</p><p id=""lcfk15"">
    Where the Cocteaus looked to obscure, the brothers Gilbert
    makes themselves fully intelligible<em>, </em>and
    at <em>Everything's The Rush</em>'s worst, you
    get wincing simulacra of 1990s ""sell out"" pop ballads whose sheer inanity was
    tough to anticipate even when Delays were at their corniest.  <em>Everything's
    The Rush </em>provides convenient scapegoats, specifically the decision to let
    keyboardist Aaron Gilbert sing; I'll stop short of namedropping CCR's <em>Mardi Gras </em>as a comparison, but not by
    much.  Harmonically, he's a great fit
    with his brother and it's hard to imagine ""Hey Girl"" or ""Nearer Than Heaven""
    having got as close to the cosmos without him. 
    But as a lead, his froggy every-bloke accent strips the band of their
    most distinguishing characteristic, not to mention all of the lyrics I
    mentioned before are his.  Aaron fairs
    better on the clubby stomper ""Friends Are False"", but that might have to do
    more with Greg murdering him on his own shit once the hook kicks in.
    </p>
<p id=""lcfk18"">
    Or you can blame the guy behind the boards if you must; the
    majority of their past work was headed by Graham Sutton of Bark Psychosis, who
    always managed to make even the most synthetic of their numbers sound humble
    and handcrafted.  For their major label
    debut, they recruited Youth, who's always fallen a hair shy of Bruckheimer
    overkill, but tellingly has enabled gargantuas of ego such as Richard Ashcroft,
    Liam Gallagher, and, if we're to believe the rumors, Axl Rose.  Whereas the past saw the group trafficking in coy ""Do you
    love me?  Check yes"" mash notes, too many
    moves here feel like the desperate begging for a last-minute prom date-- this is
    the rare band where real strings sound less appropriate than fake ones, and
    while they add a nice touch to the surprisingly tender ""Pieces"", ""Touch Down"",
    and ""Keep It Simple"" end up sounding like Pavlovian biscuits of phony
    populism.
    </p>
<p id=""lcfk18"">
    But <em>Everything's The
    Rush</em> isn't without its charms even if they do surface less frequently.  Along with the Rapture, they're one of the
    few bands that can legitimately make rock music applicable to dancefloors
    without the middlemen of disco remixers. 
    ""Girl's on Fire"" and ""Friends Are False"" in particular hurtle with a
    heady velocity that makes their underwriting feel almost necessary.  Meanwhile, knowing that ""Hooray"" is about
    Gilbert's OCD is about as important as knowing ""Valentine"" was supposedly about
    Hurricane Katrina-- which is to say, not at all. 
    It's an overwhelming, irrepressibly cheerful refrain from a band that seems
    to have an endless supply of them; even ""One More Lie In"" redeems itself at its
    chorus.  But <em>Everything's The Rush </em>often feels like one of those stock
    characters that tries to play ditzy so it can hang with the popular kids before
    eventually being loved for what they are. 
    Their previous albums ensure they'll deserve it if <em>Everything's The Rush </em>manages to break them into a higher tax
    bracket; I just hope they don't see it as a mandate for more of the same.

Rather than merely standing their ground in the battle of the sexes, these ladies are often mocking aggressors themselves. North American contemporaries like Beyoncé, Ciara, and Nelly Furtado may be occasionally prickly and even defiant, but they remain likeable; their Brit counterparts, meanwhile, openly court misanthropy.</p>
<p>Estelle possesses some of this facility for table-turning spite; that much is clear from the teasing way she puts off a would-be seducer on ""Wait a Minute (Just a Touch)"", the opening track on her U.S. debut, <i>Shine</i>. Its successor, ""No Substitute Love"", which cleverly incorporates George Michael's ""Faith"", is also verbally steely, as is ""Magnificent"", which cautions, ""Don't tell me you love me just 'cause you're in the mood."" Such lines may paint Estelle as a bitter pill, but listen again. The likes of Allen and Winehouse thrill some with their unsparing bluntness and strike others as simply noxious, but that's not really Estelle's bag: she's far more humane.</p>
<p>That Estelle isn't consumed with what she doesn't want and what you can't touch is evident by the third song, ""American Boy"", a crossover bid featuring Kanye West that predictably namechecks U.S. cities and landmarks but nonetheless features an irresistible hook and wonderfully buzzy synths courtesy of producer Will.I.Am. The remainder of the record is likewise stuffed with star beatmakers (Mark Ronson, Wyclef Jean, Swizz Beatz) and vocal guests (John Legend, Cee-Lo), meaning consistency is inevitably sacrificed to spectacle; however, when the overall effect is one of dynamism rather than incongruity, a little jumping around is forgivable.</p>
<p>In particular, the warmth and open space of old soul better suits Estelle's unpretentious, matter-of-fact nature than Winehouse's contrived soak in sin, so the tough-but-pleading ""More Than Friends"" and outright revivalist ""Pretty Please (Love Me)"" (with its perfect full-throated cameo by Cee-Lo) are both clear album highlights. The sun-kissed reggae lilts of ""Magnificent"" (featuring Ronson's patented booming backbeats) and ""Come Over"" are also seamless fits, even as they bring out Estelle's unshakeable likeness to Lauryn Hill (surely the presence of Wyclef elsewhere on the record doesn't help). <i>Shine</i>'s sheer sonic bigness and slightly schizophrenic musicality threatens to overwhelm Estelle's individuality as the record progresses, though she admirably muscles to the fore on the super-busy ""So Much Out the Way"" with ear-catching darts like ""Weezy make it rain but I'm holding the umbrella."" Unfortunately, when her candid toughness is needed most-- to bolster the generic modern soul of ""Back in Love"" and ""You Are""-- Estelle recedes into affectlessness (where her duet partner on the latter song, John Legend, permanently resides).</p>
<p><i>Shine</i>'s lingering impression is that of several talented cooks crammed into a tiny kitchen, each crafting something delicious with little regard for the meal as a whole. And maybe we don't get a great feel for the overall vision of the woman who puts her name on the marquee. As a burgeoning performer, Estelle's outlook and approach has yet to solidify, but considering how unflattering a rigid artistic mien can often be, that's far from an indictment.</p></div>"|11498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11498-shine/|6.8|Joshua Love

    Dependable isn't a glamorous adjective for a musician, and reliability doesn't sell a lot of records, but Will Oldham, through his arsenal of aliases, has been creating consistently good music for nearly two decades. At least once a year, he releases an album, EP, mini-LP, or collaboration-- and it's almost always worth hearing. At his worst, he drops a bomb like <em>The Brave &amp; the Bold</em>, his covers album with Tortoise; at his best, as on his defining 1999 album <em>I See a Darkness</em> (recorded under the name Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy), he completely uproots American musical traditions. The upside is a career with an even trajectory--
    rising only slightly but never falling off-- and the freedom to chase any
    rabbit he wants. The downsides: His albums all sell about the same; his
    audience, while loyal, neither grows nor dwindles; his followers (Iron &amp;
    Wine, Pinetop Seven) sometimes surpass him; and his presence within indie rock
    generally comforts rather than excites.</p><p>
    At first blush, the most interesting aspect of Oldham's latest album (another as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy) is its Raconteurish release strategy.
    Emphasizing digital downloads over jewel-cased CDs, Drag City rushed it to
    stores with little warning and nothing in the way of a promo blitz, bypassing
    critics' previews, promotional mp3s, and all the rigmarole that typically sells
    an indie album. Similar endeavors by more mainstream acts have yielded
    disappointing returns, but Oldham's audience will seek
    him out. And while <em>Lie Down in the Light</em>
    may not actually change his career arc, it should find a very loyal
    listenership beyond his fans.</p><p>
    For such a reliable artist, <em>Lie Down in the Light</em> is good
    enough to be actually exciting, perhaps Oldham's best
    since <em>Darkness</em>, which could be its
    evil twin. If that 10.0-worthy record plumbed the bleakness of life, <em>Light</em> finds peace in the modest pleasures of friends, family, and music. ""I like
    the places where the night does not mean an end,"" he sings on ""You Remind Me of
    Something (The Glory Goes)"", ""Where smiles break free and surprise is your
    friend/ And dancing goes on in the kitchen until dawn/ To my favorite song
    that has no end."" At times on this album, Oldham sounds
    like he's found just that place.
    </p>
<p>
    Musically, these meticulously crafted songs-- produced by Mark
    Nevers of Lambchop-- give the impression of front-porch spontaneity, their
    purposefulness made to sound like serendipity. Oldham mines many of the same
    musical veins as he has on previous albums-- these songs are heavy with old gospel,
    country, folk, and other Americana sounds-- but he tweaks them in new ways,
    adding twists and turns that even some of his most ardent fans may not expect. The free-wheeling ""Easy Does It"" opens the
    album with a churchly jangle in which Oldham's band
    (which includes mainstays Paul Oldham and Emmett Kelly, along with scads of Nashville
    musicians) trade solos. A Bakersfield
    guitar passes the plate to a barrelhouse piano, which yields to a melodica, and all the while Oldham hums like he's in a
    jug band. It's as if the instruments were introducing themselves so you'll
    recognize them in later songs, but that doesn't account for the clarinet that
    goes off on a wild tear on ""For Every Field There's a Mole"", adding a jazzy
    element that sends the song careering in a new direction, namely a rewrite of
    Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (""To every thing there is a season...""). Similarly, a mournful
    pedal steel punctuates ""You Want That Picture"", and the ambient woodwinds and
    percussive acoustic guitar give ""(Keep Eye on) Other's Gain"" an almost
    psychedelic sensibility.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Lie Down</em> may be Oldham's
    most country record of new songs in years, and it's also one of his most accessible and
    least academic records. In its loose narrative-- of a relationship forged and broken, and of lives reassured-- the Loretta Lynn to his Conway Twitty is Ashley Webber, whose full-throated, feminine roar contrasts with Oldham's
    old-man croon. ""So Everyone"", with its solemn horns and ratchety percussion
    (either a washboard or spoons), relates the excitement of new love through a
    plea for public oral sex, but there's neither a giggly nudge nor an admission of
    transgressiveness. In fact, the song sounds positively romantic. Of course,
    their second duet, ""You Want That Picture"", portrays a romance in shambles,
    each accusing the other of betrayal in a he-said/she-said dialogue.
    </p>
<p>
    Oldham certainly sees a darkness, but
    <em>Lie Down</em> ends basking in holy light.
    A Baptist organ illuminates the hymnlike closer ""I'll Be Glad"", a paean to
    God's own reliability. As it reaches its final refrain, a full choir joins Oldham
    for a few short, sweet chords that serve as a sort of benediction. Coming at
    the end of an album full of moral, romantic, and sexual gray areas, those
    closing notes sound genuinely redemptive-- not just a preordained conclusion,
    but a powerful and hard-won finale. If <em>Lie
    Down in the Light</em> sounds like the distillation of the themes and sounds Oldham
    has been tinkering with throughout his career, the result, as he sings on ""Easy
    Does It"", is ""good earthly music singing into my head.""

(Ostensibly, Cinerama's sound had ""changed"" so much it didn't sound like Cinerama anymore--polite way of saying that furious breakup anthems and the recounting of subsequent one-night stands didn't fit into Cinerama's dinner jacket and domestic bliss agenda; fortunately, these just happened to be the exact subjects the Wedding Present has specialized in for over 20 years.) Perhaps not coincidentally, the Wedding Present got its own start, back in 1985, after the drummer of Gedge's first outfit, the Lost Pandas, left him for the band's guitarist. It's romantic comedy with the crucial caveat that Gedge almost never thinks any of it is remotely funny.</p><p>
    For those keeping score, <em>El Rey</em> is the band's eighth album, not counting a bunch of compilations, singles, and reissues, and its second with Steve Albini, who recorded <em>Seamonsters</em> with the band back in 1991. Albini was, for a band whose guitars were revved way past the well-mannered C86 group-hug they were then associated with, the right guy for the job; in his own way, he probably chipped in as much as John Peel in terms of separating the band from all the other shambling, earnest, indie pop acts in England at the time. There's still nothing really like <em>Seamonsters</em>-- quick, skipping rhythm tracks, flurries of drums, terse, spilling builds, and total thematic unity in the vein of embattled love. 2005's <em>Take Fountain</em>, with its Cinerama hangover, its tentative trip back into the dating pool, was nowhere near as ferocious. <em>El Rey</em>, Gedge's self-described return to ""lust, jealousy, betrayal, regret, obsession,"" and, um, ""superheroes,"" is the band's first in a while to give the <em>Seamonsters</em>-era another go.</p><p>
<em>El Rey</em> is an L.A. record of sorts, written and recorded after a sojourn there, and Gedge-- a cynical, conniving, desperate, charming, and above all unquenchable male approaching 50-- picked a funny age at which to go. There's some incomprehension. There are some lonely nights. There is a lot of temptation, more infidelity, and some exceedingly difficult conquests. ""I thought women were supposed to tell you how they're feeling,"" Gedge says, bewildered, on ""Palisades"". ""But you're really the most unrevealing."" Whoever she is, she doesn't love him, and in some dark hour this fact results in ""Model, Actress, Whatever..."", an ode, it seems, to internet pornography: ""When I stare at you-- OK, it's just a .jpeg: I have a few.""</p><p>
    The virile Gedge of the early 90s might be horrified at this, but there's something entertaining (also, without a doubt, authentic) about his randy uncle frustrations. There are flashes of refinement: the anthemic, sample-and-guitar-feedback collage that begins ""The Thing I Like Best About Him is His Girlfriend"", for instance. And then there are the up-market descendants of Cinerama songs, arch and playful, e.g. the tambourine-heavy and feedback-free second half of the same song, a duet with bassist Terry de Castro. But mostly, it's the same old bereaved roar: ""Santa Ana Winds"", chugging in like a Black Sabbath track, one big ominously bassy, upward, awkward, frustrated arc that ends in infidelity, natch. Whoever she is, she's gone by ""Spider-Man on Hollywood"", which works a jangly guitar and a pretty backing vocal into a metaphor about seeing things-- flying saucers, shooting stars, a girl who'll stick around-- that don't exist. On whispery crooner ""The Trouble with Men"" Gedge agonizes about his own roving eye; over ""Swingers""'s light bossa nova, Gedge stand-in de Castro accuses a girlfriend of the same, ""like Bridget Bardot in <em>...And God Created Woman</em>."" Gedge evidently has been at the cable TV lately. ""Soup"", a cad's tale about a one-night stand that will not result in a phone call the next day, breaks the news via ""Seinfeld"": ""No soup for you!""</p><p>
    That one's a little bit much, and for a guy who's been doing pretty much the same thing for a few decades now, syndication is probably not an idea he wants to be bringing up. <em>El Rey</em> has its share of surprises, mostly in the vein of its particular subject, which is the cruelty older men visit on younger women, and vice versa. But mostly it's merely another Wedding Present record: witty, randy, guitar-heavy, and not quite satisfied.</p></div>"|11543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11543-el-rey/|7.5|Zach Baron

    The Sword may be the reluctant avatars of metal's recent indie acceptance, but it's unclear what landed them in that position. Nothing about the High on Fire-ripping or Black Sabbath sludge of the Austin quartet's debut album <em>Age of Winter</em>s set it apart from the pack of bands doing the same thing in 2006 (ok, maybe those supremely tough dueling guitars, but that's hardly enough, right?). And, for that matter, none of its tracks struck any metal-for-non-metalheads poses (we're looking at you, Goblin Cock). Rather, their dominion over the scene seems like something of an arbitrary media decision. <em>Eh, we might as well pick one to speak for them all, and they're better than Priestess, so why not? </em></p><p>
    The result: more praise, pressure, and criticism than deserved. But while they didn't ask for it (unless you count signing to Kemado against them), this is the Sword's hand to play. And on <em>Gods of the Earth</em>, the money-shot follow-up to <em>Age of Winters</em>, the band seems acutely aware of their position, doing everything they can to ratify the will of the people who've tossed the crown on their heads. That means bigger, louder, prouder songs, gongs, devil growls, Celtic acoustic interludes, and a lot more of the 12-sided die bullshit that got obscured by all the <em>Guitar Hero-</em>fated muck on the debut. And if that isn't a bad thing, it's certainly a silly one.</p><p>
    Even so, strip away all the aesthetic boosting, and much like <em>Winters</em>, <em>Gods</em> is a straight-forward metal record, content to rattle off wide-load riffs with recognizable Tolkien-style imagery as the backdrop. The usual suspects are all here: Frost Giants, Axes, Fire Lances, Black Rivers, White Seas, and whatever the hell a Hyperzephyrian is. For the most part, the goblin gobbledygook works. And when singer/guitarist J.D. Cronise doesn't take the D&amp;D punchlining overboard, he and Kyle Shutt's riffs are downright Herculean. 
    </p>
<p>
    But dig any deeper than the surface, and it's real fish-in-a-barrel sort of stuff. Dueling weedles. Halftime section. Galloping drums. Yippee. For the most part, it's all the same old bong-thrash, save for the record's one non-heavy trick: English-jig folk. Or more accurately, the happy Hobbit stuff that heavy metal's been crushing on for ages. The Sword use it twice, on the album's centerpiece, ""To Take the Black"",  and the nameless hidden track that closes things out. On one level, it's a smart move, breaking up the monotony and adding something new to the sludgy stew. On another-- like the cheesy growl tucked in the middle of ""Lords"" and the ridiculously indulgent gong that peppers ""Fire Lances of the Hyperzephyrians""-- it further dilutes the potency of an album that loses a lot of its directness in trying to fill the wrong shoes. <br/>

Since that collection's release, the deluge of fingerpicked guitar records has continued unabated, and Tompkins Square has become the sort of magnet for talented guitarists that John Fahey's legendary Takoma label once was. A second <em>Imaginational Anthem</em> compilation arrived in 2006, and several of the series' alumni-- including James Blackshaw, Jack Rose, Glenn Jones, and José González-- have since each released multiple solo albums across a variety of labels. At the same time there has also arrived a bounty of unearthed 1960s-era folk guitar albums, including Tompkins Square's own  reissues of seminal works by Robbie Basho and Harry Taussig.</p><p>
    The American Primitive market therefore is as flooded as it has ever been, and even the most diehard guitar aficionados can afford to be pretty goddamn choosy. So due to the timing of its arrival-- and thanks in no small  part to Tompkins Square's own success at making so much top-flight guitar music available-- the new <em>Imaginational Anthem Vol. 3</em> bravely risks redundancy as it returns once again to the seemingly inexhaustible folk-guitar wellspring.</p><p>
    As with the first two volumes in the series, label chief Josh Rosenthal has curated <em>IA3</em> with a loving, handcrafted touch, gathering artists from both past and present to construct an informal timeline for the music and its traditions. While past editions have included rare cuts from genre pioneers like Fahey, Sandy Bull, and Robbie Basho, this collection places focus on a broad cross-section of lesser-known performers.  The set features guitarists from around the globe, including Steffan Basho-Junghans (Germany) , Cian Nugent (Ireland), Ben Reynolds (UK), as well as players from virtually every corner of America. Despite this globetrotting, there are frustratingly few actual regional variations in evidence, as the musicians seem to draw upon the same familiar Takoma-derived pool of folk, bluegrass, and raga influences. So much so, in fact, that even after repeat listens it is challenging to recognize each track's performer or point of origin without assistance from Rosenthal's informative liner notes. </p><p>
    Of course, with this many exceptional musicians on board there are still some stellar performances here, and with a slightly more adventurous tilt than on past volumes. The virtual unknown Richard Crandell, who also appeared on the Numero Group's recent rarities collection <em>Wayfaring Strangers: Guitar Soli</em>, opens the album with the exquisite ""Zocalo"". This melodic piece, which echoes the British folk of John Renbourn or Wizz Jones, is one of the most lucid and addictive guitar tracks of recent memory. (And in case it hasn't yet been made clear, there's been a bunch of them.) Frequent Keith Fullerton Whitman collaborator Greg Davis contributes the mesmeric ""Sleep Architecture"", whose gentle dreamwaves are eventually resolved in a disorienting swirl of field recordings and tape effects. </p><p>
    Most arresting of all might be George Stavis' ""Goblins"", a thorny work for five-string banjo that was originally cut for his 1969 Vanguard album <em>Labyrinths</em>. Packed with furious action and melodic digression, this piece moves to its own infernal logic and gives the album's latter stretches a much-needed jolt of energy. Elsewhere, however, there are too many tracks that illustrate the elusive challenge of finding a distinctive style in this crowded field. Shorter pieces by Nathan Salsburg and Matt Baldwin fail to establish much of a presence, while on ""Blue Mountain Raga II"" even the phenomenal Basho-Junghans spends too long fruitlessly chasing himself in circles. </p><p>
    Despite such lapses, <em>IA3</em> does add another worthy chapter to the <em>Imaginational Anthem</em> series, which is now also available as a box set containing all three volumes. Taken as a whole, these three albums provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing American Primitive movement, and will likely provide a large enough resevoir to tide you over handsomely should that acoustic guitar drought ever come.</p></div>"|11517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11517-imaginational-anthem-vol-3/|6.1|Matthew Murphy

    Whenever the alt-world supergroup Free Kitten (Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and Pussy Galore's Julie Cafritz, in conjunction with various pals, including Boredoms drummer Yoshimi P-We) took to the recording studio, anything and everything was fair game-- obnoxious atonal guitar screeds, off-kilter hook-laden pop, awkward rock-based hip-hop, shimmering Serge Gainsbourg covers. The one constant in Free Kitten's plan of attack was their maddening inconsistency, both in style and in quality-- single tracks might knock your socks off, but the breadth and length of their three albums (two full-lengths, one singles compilation) aren't for the faint of heart.  While <em>Inherit</em> is Free Kitten's first album in over 10 years, that aspect of the group sadly hasn't changed.</p><p>
    This time around (with the three lovely ladies getting J Mascis to join the fun on a few tunes), they trade their scattershot genre-hopping for a more concise two-pronged approach.  The majority of the album-- eight track's worth-- is taken up by Gordon-fronted expansive blissed-out meanderings one tends to expect on proper Sonic Youth albums from Thurston Moore or Lee Ranaldo. Whether the group takes the scenic route (as on the 11-minute ""Monster Eye"") or plots a more direct course (via the ominous tribal throb of ""Billboard""), it's in no rush to reach its destination.  Instead, it luxuriates in waves of feedback and mildly propulsive percussion-- even Mascis' squealing contributions to ""Surf's Up"" do little to up the energy level.  This approach works just fine when Gordon's indomitable singing voice is treated as just another piece of the reverb-drenched scenery, as on album closer ""Sway"" or the shamanistic ""Free Kitten on the Mountain"".  When she actually speaks her mind, however, things don't go so well-- her spoken-word guitar-hero tribute at the end of the otherwise enjoyable ""Monster Eye"" is chock-full of hollow portent and leaden poetics (""he starts doing surgery...then he starts strumming slowly"") , while the lame lit-centric jabs in ""The Poet"" (""The New York school/ It's made of dicks"") recall <em>Dirty</em>-era Gordon at her laziest.</p><p>
    Those jonesing for a high-quality emulation of those halcyon days need look no further than the four <em>Inherit</em> tracks fronted by Cafritz.  Her tunes are full of invigorating piss and vinegar, be they centered around sing-songy rhymes (like ""Seasick"") or hit-and-run punches powered by Yoshimi's best Steve Shelley imitation (like ""Roughshod"" or ""Help Me"").  The dodgiest of her four efforts is ""Bananas"", an irony-powered pile of sludge (with Mascis on the skins) whose braindead rhetoric (""Monkey see/ Monkey do/ Hello monkey/ I see you"") is either brilliantly stupid or the sort of nonsense that makes one seriously reconsider intelligent design.  Still, a full album of these rave-ups would be welcome. As would be a full album of Gordon making the skronky granola scene (with the hope that she either chooses her words more carefully, or opts to speak softly).  Unfortunately, <em>Inherit</em> tries to give the listener both of these great tastes at once, resulting in a combination that's less like chocolate and peanut butter, and more like toothpaste and orange juice.

It's so undangerous and sub-ironics that it seems to circle back around to being scary, snide, and nihilist. I crack up every time I'm getting to see them live and someone wheezes any variation on ""I cannot wait to get my fill of...HEALTH!"" (How did these guys resist-- especially since, like certain fellow Californians Zach Hill and Spencer Seim, they share a love for maniac percussion and Nintendosonics-- giving themselves the pseudo-metal moniker Hellth?)<span></span></p><p>
    HEALTH's self-titled debut earned them sniggering sobriquets like ""Boredoms Jr"" and ""Diet Liars,"" yet a<span></span>mong what kept the admittedly derivative album interesting was the tension produced by its attempts to artfully reconcile dance/digital elements with rock/noise textures (not to mention <span> </span>its ambient fringes and the occasional blotch of straight-up pop). The resulting sound was skeletal, adrenal, and clangorous. Listeners inclined to attribute narrative structure to otherwise chaotically sequenced albums could even consider the debut as bearing a tale of one musical mode's victory over-- or surrender to-- another: The electro-clubbily titled and (eventually) executed ""Glitter Pills"" was followed by the lurching (dying?) rock of ""Perfect Skin"", and then the platter closed with the tribal, clipped-Gregorian funereality of ""Lost Time"".</p><p>
    Which brings us to this remix album that feels like an argument: HEALTH's discography is here to mend those leftover rifty, provincial scenes where the guitar dorks and electro goobers still get aesthetically territorial at each others' keggers.<span> </span>Just a couple of weeks ago, I saw opener the Death Set put a crowd of (to safely generalize) dance-kids awaiting a Bonde Do Role and Villains card on edge by screaming ""Come on, you motherfuckers, this is a punk rock show!"" While, yup, the Death Set remix dance tracks and all, their own stuff is hooky hardcore, in some ways a better bridge from Death From Above 1979 into MSTRKRFT than that, ugh, DFA1979 remix album (plus all them groups are/were kinda dickish on stage).<span> </span>What I'm trying to say is that the overtly dancefloor <em>DISCO/DISCO+</em> is a whole other thing from HEALTH's previous output, and yet, it works.
    </p><p>
<em>HEALTH</em> ran so lean that you wanted to offer it some smoked gouda and cherry pop, so one might expect a rework-roster of blog-friendly artisans to supply the cheese and, well, coke. But <em>DISCO</em> is that rare, not-disposable such collection, largely justifying the charming pomp of the band-- printing their project names in allcaps, the tendency to issue artistic statements, etc. Of <em>DISCO, </em>they decreed: ""It is not about market saturation or crossover appeal. It is purely about the music, and we are proud of it. This is an album, and meant to be listened to as one. The goal of this record is not only to present all these songs at once, but also to ensure that they are not forgotten in the constantly updating, content-hungry internet music world."" Okay, they've hitched their viral sincerity to their synergy-savvy; just as Crystal Castles gave HEALTH's profile an alley-oop (and like hip-hop and r&amp;b's infamous, infinite ""featuring""s), they're boosting this release's electronic acts, to the point of listing them as members in a collective on <em>DISCO</em>'s separate-from-regular-ol'-HEALTH MySpace page. And don't get my wallet started on the website for <a href=""http://health.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>HEALTH FASHION</strong></a>, your mailorder source for American Apparel V-necks boasting pastel mandates. 
    </p>
<p>
    The bandmembers' names don't appear in this review because I am taking the group up on its insistence that it's not concerned with the pretense/spotlight of individual utterance-- in fact, I kind of wish they, sigh,<span> </span>took it further by wearing masks and adopting glyphic pseudonyms. This dance collage may often push the vocals to the front of the mix much more than its source material did, but those droned-in, genderless, ghost-tech vox are what make HEALTH seem both disembodied and like a superorganism in the first place.<span> </span>The concept/gimmick of identity is further shattered by the diversity of the remixers' approaches; <em>DISCO</em> is like an Oz or Wonkan chocolate factory of beat styles, all proving the point that drum machines can pummel just as cathartically, and as fetchingly, as forearms. 
    </p>
<p>
    Some of the remixers employ only one processed and reverbed ""clonk!""<em> </em>from <em>HEALTH</em>, yet others use the original work's entire structure as an undergirding. <em>DISCO</em>'s basic arc is: begin close to home, drift (albeit aggressively) through decades of electronic music, rest for a metronomic eight-minute piece by C.L.A.W.S. to wonder what the point of life is, and backtrack to a computer simulation of HEALTH's OCD assault for a finale. Amateurish DJs might score respect by playing the Acid Girls remixes, because their constant, exciting shifts will leave the impression that you're blending multiple tracks. Thrust Lab's epic ""Problem Is"" comes off as somehow funny and ominous, tonally coasting from Vangelis' <em>Blade Runner</em> score into Giorgio Moroder into some Weather Report fusion, landing on (duh) M83. CFCF's take on ""Triceratops"" picks up that dairy product and trumps it by adding Oldfield/<em>Exorcist</em>-y ""Tubular Bells"" jive, and some of that Steely Dan shit that Adult Swim's Tim and Eric mock/celebrate, all with a sick pulse reminiscent of so many 80s horror movie jams, including Hot Ice's ""Theme From <em>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> Part 3 in 3-D</em>"".
    </p>
<p>
    The bonus material on DISCO+ is less of-a-piece, but just as varied and deserving of widescale distribution. Nastique throws the classically stilted ""Blue Monday"" beat under HEALTH's prehistoric-squawk bus, Bearded Baby re-remixes Crystal Castles' (also included here) HEALTH remix,<span> </span>and Captain Ahab mashes the band up with Foot Village's wellness-centered ""Protective Nourishment"". Only <em>DISCO+</em> is as playful as the cover art's promise of ""ALL THE HITS"" in an awesomely humorless font. So, forfeit the urge to hold a conviction-o-meter up to these rattle-come-latelies' homages to Swans, Ruins, and Lightning Bolt. <em>DISCO </em>streamlines <em>HEALTH</em>'s analog-trance thickets without letting the beats betray the atmospherics.<span> </span>Never merely meager, this project delivers, both when you're waving your orgy-snorkel all blotto on-the-town, and for a soundtrack to serious rumination at your midday desk of harsh reality. None of the parties involved are inventing, or reinventing, anything, necessarily, but damn if they aren't tinkering their asses off.

Their mix-and-match post-punk ditties manage to sound both affected and effective at the same time; they're weirdly life-affirming and very fun. You want to dance when you hear them-- dance with a furrowed brow, maybe, but move around nonetheless. Singer Brad Hargett is from Brooklyn by way of Florida but sounds like he's from Manchester by way of Slough. The main thing I wonder when I listen to Crystal Stilts is why is it so hard to make exceptional garage-pop like this? I mean, how hard can it be to plonk out a little la-la-loo-lee number on your $80 Sears guitar or your beat-up Casio and then record the thing in the bathroom in one take? It's been stated in ways both eloquent (David Fair's brilliant and oft-quoted manifesto ""How to Play Guitar"") and cheesy as heck (Bono's ""three chords and the truth"" which he lifted from Harland Howard re: Hank Williams), but should it not by definition be simple to do this?</p><p>
    Of course it is not. Rock'n'roll is theft-- all the great ideas have been recycled a thousand one times already. So to hit upon a winning combination of old and new gets harder than coming up with a band name that doesn't return hundreds of hits when you plug it into the old Google. (I have to say that I wish another band had already called themselves Crystal Stilts already, as the name outright blows-- plus what's with the mini-plague of Crystal bands?) Self-limiting is the key to great garage-pop: By keeping it stripped-down on purpose-- whether you're the Saints ca. 1975 or Beat Happening ca. their whole career-- you unleash something greater than yourself. This is the Oulipian ideal, that one can free the subconscious by making oneself a drone to either the obvious or to seemingly haphazard rules. It's also partly why La Monte Young is punk as fuck-- but you know that already.</p><p>
    Crystal Stilts do not sound like the Saints or Beat Happening or La Monte Young. These are weird pop songs you clap your hands along to. They pile a rockabilly riff and nursery school melodies onto a revved-up bass line and sweet surfy 60s organ riff on top of minimalist percussion on the song ""Crystal Stilts"". The amazing ""Crippled Croon"" takes the stand-up drum roll from ""Just Like Honey"" and grafts echoed-up vocals, a reverb-swallowed guitar, and a sub-atomic bass line onto it. And ""Shattered Shine"", with its psychedelic layers of tambourine, guitar, and organ, is a perfect marriage of Ian Curtis-y doom with sunshine-y Shop Assistants-style pop. The Stilts sing in fake Brit-sounding accents, but somehow the dude's droll, goth-y croon never grates; it helps that the band pushes his vocals way low in the mix.</p><p>
    In what little press the band has gotten, they've been compared to New Zealand bands. I feel that a lot of this alleged New Zealand copping has been pasted onto the Stilts because it was Clean drummer/singer Hamish Kilgour who helped to ""discover"" and help the group out. It's worth pointing out that in the 80s themselves, many American acts were greatly influenced by NZ groups. It was the late 80s, of course (and on into the early 90s), but acts as beloved today as Pavement and Neutral Milk Hotel-- as well as currently obscure acts such as World of Pooh and Wingtip Sloat-- would have sounded a lot different if they hadn't been buying up every Flying Nun record they could get their hands on back in the day. Some folks complain that they cannot understand Brad Hargett's lyrics, but pop lyrics are typically a disappointment. Burying them is actually a winning strategy, and it's a safe bet that this is intentional-- that Crystal Stilts are aesthetes and are doing this because they also like records that sound this way. Either that, or the Stilts are broke as shit.</p></div>"|11469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11469-crystal-stilts/|8.3|Mike McGonigal

On one hand, the Drift is pretty easy to categorize, residing on the post-rock-heavy label Temporary Residence and creating the same sort of obtuse instrumental compositions as label-mates Explosions in the Sky and Mono, and fellow San Franciscans Continental. But it's not quite so easy to locate their tenor, to get the band's own ""drift.""</p><p>
    Just about everything about the Drift screams ""slippery slope"": The vague bebop influence-- jazz brass and double bass both crop up-- runs the risk of turning into Beat café beard stroking; the dub infused post-rock flavor can evoke jam bands; long stretches of little-changing guitar riffs and horn swells can become a chore. This all would seem to damn <em>Memory Drawings</em> as a cliché from the outset. But it's an intriguing contradiction that the band's somber vibe, similar to that of their Temporary Residence contemporaries, rubs up against their jazzy backgrounds to reveal a subtle inner game of impatience tugging at all edges of their compositions.</p><p>
    The Drift have been eager to step out of their affinity for ambient rock ever since the group's first release, the <em>Streets/Nozomi</em> EP. The folky influence of New Weird America seeps through, frosting the light tremolo-affected guitar that leads into ""I Had a List and I Lost It"", and providing melodic counterpoint to the doleful brass of ""Smoke Falls"". Then the group can, on a whim, seamlessly transition from electric folk into the space-age resonance of dub on ""If Wishes Were Like Horses"". But given all the random noise and offhand feedback that could be heard on their debut full-length <em>Noumena</em>, <em>Memory Drawings</em> is a comparatively straightforward take. These compositions, scooting to a start from the first plaintive guitar riff or trumpet line, are exquisitely seen, never dilly-dallying over their eight-odd minutes. From the driving ""Uncanny Valley"" pour shades of funky soul along with detached guitar and twittering trumpet lines. ""Golden Sands"" could be mistaken for the Balearic kraut-dub of Sweden's Studio or London's A Mountain of One, especially considering the hypnotic and sometimes fiery battery commanded by drummer Rich Douthit.
    </p><p>
<em>Memory Drawings</em> may be the friendliest recording the Drift have released thus far, but it still escapes rational discussion beyond the summation of its influences. Part of the problem is that the group doesn't really profess mastery of any of those influences, preferring instead to shop around for an assortment of textures to suit their needs. Half the time, the band doesn't sound at all like a dub group, and their jazz influence only rears its head when Jeff Jacobs' brass or Safa Shokrai's bass decides to step up the tempo. But the Drift exercise great taste and patience in the contemplative histories they borrow from, and while they tarry in the classic post-rock world of repetitive, abstract grooves, they also keep one foot in some other fantastic land at all times, always one step ahead of our efforts to apprehend them.

    I'd imagine that <em>Old
    School </em>finds its way into many a Netflix queue at this point in the year, as
    outgoing college seniors face the grim specter of adulthood. 
    Maybe it's just serendipitous timing, but I can't help but see this film
    as a primary influence on <em>You May Already
    Be Dreaming</em>, even if Neva Dinova has been around since the 1990s and are on their
    third full-length LP.  As Saddle Creek's
    diaspora continues to expand sonically as well as geographically, for their label debut, the Nebraska band (previously featured with Conor Oberst on the <em>One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels EP</em>) sounds seduced by the prospect of
    ""living the dream"" via arrested development, in this case, a time when the imprint/collective
    could be relied on for little more than Omaha natives playing a tears-in-your-Sparks combo of ""acceptable country"" structure and indie self-centeredness.  The simplicity of the form makes it
    incredibly hard to fuck up, but <em>You May
    Already Be Dreaming </em>posits that it's also incredibly hard to make
    interesting.</p><p>
    It's far from unlistenable-- the production is crisp and
    smooth, the songs uncomplicated and uncluttered-- and Jake Bellows has a
    pleasant, conversational sing-speak of a voice that rests somewhere near saltine
    roots-types like Andrew Bird and M. Ward. 
    But the title unfortunately serves as its own epitaph: envision an
    alternate reality where the California
    sound of the 70s was more influenced by ether than cocaine.  Even when they try to season their folky
    blandishments with fuzzbox soloing on ""Clouds"" and ""Someone's Trippin'"", it's
    still too lethargic to sound like something other than the death whinnies of
    Crazy Horse lurching to the glue factory.</p><p>
    Perhaps even more so than Titus Andronicus, these guys beg
    for a reevaluation in regards to the influence early Saddle Creek
    recordings.  While Conor Oberst and Tim
    Kasher rarely saw past their own shoes and tended to equate violently
    oscillating caterwaul with honesty, they managed to short-circuit conventional
    confessional songwriting by failing to acknowledge any walls, let alone the
    fourth.  The problem here is that Bellows
    has far too much trouble saying what he actually means.  ""It's hard to love a body from the ground""
    goes the infinitely repeated mantra of the first track, and while it's not hard
    to follow, it also doesn't amount to a whole lot. 
    ""Will the Ladies Send You Flowers"" tries for some sort of hardscrabble
    deathbed confessional, but you never get a sense of any real emotion other than
    comfortable numbness, and I'm fairly certain that wasn't the point; the vague laments
    about women and whiskey reek of someone who slept through most of their week at
    Drive-By Truckers Fantasy Camp.  
    </p>
<p>
    Specificity rarely turns out well either, as ""Supercomputer""
    tries to install Wolf Parade's ""We Built Another World"" into a MacBook, but
    instead we get a liveblog of playing SimEarth. 
    And if there's a time when lyrically using ""Google"" as a verb will be
    acceptable, it's far in the future.  Even
    when they (maybe) skew misogynistic on ""She's A Ghost"", lines like ""Let the sun
    dry your towels instead of me"" are really too cryptic to offer even a base
    pleasure.    
    </p>
<p>
    But as much as the words drag down <em>You May Already Be Dreaming</em>, Neva Dinova's bigger problem is
    casting its lot with such a limited handful of sounds.  If we're to take ""Apocalypse"" at face value,
    David Bazan will be narrating the End Of Days half asleep next to a humming amp.  And you would think these guys would know
    better than to ladle a song called ""Tryptophan"" on this platter-- especially when it's acoustic and comes at the midpoint of an
    experience that often feels like freebasing raw, uncut tedium.

Part of this branding is associative: Her flagship album was named <em>Berlinette</em>, and Allien has flirted aggressively with Berlin minimalism, imbuing all of her projects with dark, skeletal cores. On <em>Thrills</em>, this core was offset by trip-hop tropes; on Apparat collaboration <em>Orchestra of Bubbles</em>, by techno-pop opulence. But on <em>Sool</em>, Allien has caught up with her reputation. It is all core: uncompromising, barren, and austere.</p><p>
<em>Orchestra of Bubbles</em> was the rare Allien project with advertised collaborators. Often, she's had more discreet partners-- SmashTV on <em>Berlinette</em>, for instance-- and on <em>Sool</em>, Berlin's AGF helps out on production. Whether this darker turn for Allien owes to AGF's influence is anybody's guess, and quickly ceases to matter after you sink below <em>Sool</em>'s deceptively shallow surface, into its inestimable depths. Listeners who've enjoyed the radiant humanity with which Allien has often graced her tracks might be daunted, as <em>Sool </em>is a defiantly post-human record. Voices, when they appear, are garbled crowd chatter (""Einsteigen""), the Field-style slivers (""Bim""), or alien languages that only Maja Ratkje could translate (""Elphine""). On ""Caress"" and ""Out"", Allien works over the titular words until they shed their meaning and become another moving part in a complex contraption. The sole exception is ""Frieda"", a melting electro-pop ballad with airy, intelligible vocals that offers a brief respite from the album's brutal opacity.</p><p>
    At its smallest and most obscure, <em>Sool </em>suggests a world in which the last sentience has expired, but machines run on, humming and cooling in a depopulated landscape. Muted, rococo bass lines and echoing percussive flecks rub against each other with robotic persistence, and like the proverbial tree falling in an empty forest, we picture a drum machine percolating the air in an empty room. This is the first impression <em>Sool </em>conveys, but repeated listens reveal a humanity clandestinely working beneath its rhythmic clockwork. On the surface of ""Sprung"", we move by echolocation through its darkness before locating the elaborate, synthetic hand percussion. Most of <em>Sool </em>operates this way: The dominant mood is stern and deadening; the recessive one is playful and alive.
    Allien's beats may be matte-finish, but they contain loads of subtle grayscale contrast offset by embellishments of startling brilliancy. Textural snippets glance off of each other with sandpapery friction, or cascade over the compositions like fiber-optic shimmers. This is especially pronounced on the aptly-titled ""Caress"": Amid a heavenly drone and thumping percussive triplets, a ping-ponging sub-rhythm and muffled rolls seem to build a static charge, raising the hairs on the back of your neck. It's these deep contrasts between dull and bright elements, or near-sounding and distant-sounding ones, that lend the album its odd sense of space. For microbeat-based music, it feels surprisingly ample. On ""MM"", for example, the rhythm ticks concisely, like a marble bouncing on tile, while the bass fans out overhead, leaving a great chasm between them. Still, as minimalist manifestos go, <em>Sool</em> is strident, and some listeners might wish Allien hadn't done such a good job of it-- it asks for a lot, and metes out its rewards slowly. But I find it to be a profoundly articulate conceptual space, both rudimentary and complex, composed of more nothing than something. That ""nothing"" can be disorienting to wade through, and we're lucky to have Allien, one of techno's most confident producers, as our guide.</p></div>"|11525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11525-sool/|8.0|Brian Howe

    In one sense, you could call
    Morgan Khan an importer. That's basically what he did when he set up Street
    Sounds, the subsidiary to his dance label Streetwave, and released the first <em>Street</em><em> Sounds Electro </em>compilation in 1983: here were eight tracks out of the United States that would've cost a couple of dozen quid for a UK buyer to import, all collected together for a price
    under five pounds. As a business decision, it was pretty shrewd, but as a
    scene-maker it was flat-out seismic: Thanks to the budget pricing and each
    volume's two sides of tight, continuous mixing from the likes of Herbie Laidley
    and the Mastermind sound system, the 22-volume <em>Street Sounds Electro </em>series-- later <em>Street Sounds Hip Hop Electro </em>and finally just <em>Street Sounds
    Hip Hop-- </em>was a major factor in defining what UK B-boys caught on to in the
    hip-hop world between 1983 and 1988.</p><p>
<em>Street Sounds Electro: The
    Ultimate Boxed Set </em>includes all 22
    volumes of this influential series collected in mp3 form on two CD-Rs,
    preserving the DJ mixes as they initially appeared on the original vinyl. In
    many ways, it's a fortunate time capsule that hits on a lot of the now-iconic
    electro and rap classics of the mid-late 1980s and what sort of context they
    came from. Yet it also offers a deeper, messier variation on the evolution of
    hip-hop, one that covers most of the major bases between the old school and the
    sample era-- Grandmaster Flash, Run-D.M.C., the Roxanne wars, the dawn of golden
    age icons like BDP and Eric B. &amp; Rakim and EPMD-- then complicates it all
    by throwing in a lot of strange stuff that history completely forgot, for
    reasons both unfair and justified.</p><p>
    Just to give you a quick
    rundown of what was included in initial 11 volumes: Three cuts
    from West Coast electro master Egyptian Lover, including a 10:21 remix of
    1985's all-kinds-of-nasty ""Girls"", five tracks from the B-Boys of ""Two, Three,
    Break"" fame, Cybotron's 1984 genre-name progenitor ""Techno City"", and the infamous
    Herbie Hancock ""Megamix"" put together by Grandmixer D.St. Then, of course,
    there are <em>the </em>anthems: Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel's ""White Lines"",
    Freestyle's ""Don't Stop the Rock"", Rockmaster Scott and the Dynamic Three's
    ""The Roof Is on Fire"", West Street Mob's ""Break Dance - Electric Boogie"",
    Mantronix's ""Needle to the Groove"", Hashim's ""Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)"", and
    Arthur Baker's ""Breakers Revenge"", just for starters. With the exception of the
    largely overlooked Afrika Bambaataa, whose only appearance in the entire series
    is a two-minute fragment of ""Bambaataa's Theme (Assault on Precinct 13)"" in
    Volume 13's clusterbomb of a mix, this is one of the more complete collections
    of electro and dance-provoking rap out there. 
    </p>
<p>
    While the significant
    presence of classic early-mid 80s rap integrated itself into the tenor of each
    <em>Street Sounds </em>edition-- or sometimes clashed against it, like the slow,
    wobbly dubbed-out strut-bounce of Rammellzee vs. K-Rob's ""Beat Bop"" did amongst
    the otherwise uptempo pop-and-lock fodder of 1983's Volume 2-- it started to
    gradually dominate the series as a whole, swapping out the
    vocoders-and-Kraftwerk vibe of classic electro for the harder, sparser sounds
    of hip hop's first hardcore phase. The second disc, covering Volumes 12-22,
    bears this out over time. The aforementioned Volume 13 megamix (originally released in 1986) reduces 21
    tracks to a fragment of their original lengths-- typically between 90 seconds
    and three and a half minutes-- and streams them together in a largely seamless two-side
    blend of rap, r&amp;b, and even synthpop: one stretch features the early (and
    ridiculous) Sir Mix-a-Lot single ""Square Dance Rap"", electro favorite Captain
    Rock's ""Return of Capt. Rock"", and a remix of the Information Society single
    ""Running"", before later going on to drop hip-hop classics like ""Pee-Wee's Dance""
    and ""Eric B. Is President"".
    </p>
<p>
    By 1987, the word ""Electro"" started
    disappearing from the compilation's now ""Hip Hop""-focused titles, the 808s
    slowed down drastically and sample-based cuts by the Ultramagnetic MCs
    (""Traveling at the Speed of Thought""; ""Funky"") and J.V.C. F.O.R.C.E. (""Strong
    Island""; ""Doing Damage"") started making their way into the mix. By '88, the
    last year of the <em>Street Sounds Electro </em>series, the closest it got to
    uptempo electro-rap was Rob Base &amp; DJ EZ Rock's ""It Takes Two""-- by which
    time it was on its way to bypassing the whole ""electro"" thing entirely and
    getting identified as ""hip-house."" It's an illuminating history, an evolution
    of sound in a sort of beyond-canonical macrocosm.
    </p>
<p>
    And by ""beyond-canonical
    macrocosm"", I mean there's a lot of extraneous crap. Some of it's fascinating,
    like Levi 167's ""Something Fresh to Swing To"", which shows up on 1988's Volume
    20, builds up this monster drum machine rhythm and then sneaks in this
    occasional recurring sequence of Casio notes that sounds like the kind of
    melody the RZA would build a Bobby Digital track around 10 years later. And there's
    a good number of obscure mid-late 80s get-drunk-and-yell party anthems, like
    Bay Area crew A.T.C.'s ""This Beat is Def"" (featuring production from a young Paris) and the Almighty El-Cee's hard-hitting motormouth
    showcase ""We Have Risen"". But with a collection like this that was compiled as
    the scene actually happened and developed, there's no 20/20 hindsight to keep
    the mediocrities out, and there's plenty of them-- ranging from the Packman's
    grating Volume 1 opener ""I'm the Packman (Eat Everything I Can)"" to the Diaz
    Brothers' mostly-useless Dirty Harry-quoting ""It Takes Two"" megamix/knockoff
    ""Here We Go Again"" on Volume 22. In between there's Newcleus' godawful corny
    ""Huxtable House Party"" (which I'd like to think is what turned Bill Cosby
    against rap in the first place), CIA's bizarre Beastie Boys ripoff ""My Posse""
    (written by Ice Cube and produced by Dr. Dre! <em>In 1988!</em>), Exhibit A against the idea of swing rap in The Jury's ""The Cotton Club"", the gooey,
    cloying saxophones all over Key-Matic's ""Breakin' in Space"", and a whole lot of
    stuff that sounds a bit like Arthur Baker only with fewer ideas. This is one of
    those collections where you take the bad with the good, and there's more than
    enough of both.
    </p>
<p>
    Given how limited a pressing
    this collection is, your chances of being able to find this for yourself are
    fairly slim, and between the cost ($80+ American) and the headache of trying to
    find it anywhere, it might not necessarily be worth the effort, especially with
    many of the more desirable rarities included in mixed, cut, re-edited, and
    otherwise incomplete form. But when it works, it's definitely worth hearing. There's
    a third disc on this thing, by the way-- a DVD that includes a bunch of great music
    videos not just from electro and hip hop artists like Bambaataa and the Jonzun
    Crew and Man Parrish, but also fellow travelers Art of Noise, pop analogues New
    Order and progenitors Kraftwerk. It's a fine collection, and it might be the
    best part of the whole box, for one important reason: someone actually had the good sense to wait 25
    years and see what was worth including after the fact.

The problem is that great duos in hip-hop never need to tell everyone just how intuitively combustible they are. When the upright Boot Camp Clik foreman hooked up with Little Brother's young-buck-producer 9th Wonder for their debut album, 2005's <em>Chemistry</em>, the logic was simple: youthful, nostalgic producer meets veteran, respected MC flickering into obscurity. 9th Wonder, then at the tail-end of his productive partnership with Little Brother and its loveless, snarky MCs (Phonte and Big Pooh, for the record) had bumped into Buckshot during a studio session. He confessed his boyhood fandom (9th was eighteen when Black Moon's 1993 debut dropped). Buckshot, grateful, applauded the young producer's commitment and acumen in crate-digging. The compulsory promises to try and find a project together are forgone. That very day the savvy rookie and the vet get into the booth, and voila, the lion's share of their feeling-out process became, as they reminded us, time and time again, <em>Chemistry</em>.</p><p>
    The album was filled with sturdy, backward-looking prescriptions: Buckshot's effortlessly wry punch lines and 9th Wonder's trotting, sample-heavy beat scholarship. Their follow up, this year's <em>The Formula</em>, doesn't twist, invert, or spin their unwavering relationship. The album is an unforced renewal of vows-- vows with the same gaps and same peaks they had since they set out together. Even when a track on <em>The Formula</em> isn't an explicitly rote café love song-- and that's only about half the songs-- the psychology is meek hope, faint pride, reserve. Buckshot settles for his old preferences-- fists versus guns, 'dro versus yeyo-- and abstract praise for the struggle: ""Time fly by/ Guess how many people tryin' to make it in the world/ So am I/ I can't lie, I be on the side like 'Yeah/ Anything moving I'm there'"" (""Hold It Down"").</p><p>
    Buckshot was never a rhetorical wizard like KRS or a stylist like Big L, but he sounds beyond cruise control, dangling sloppy enjambments and settling, the vast, vast majority of the time, for the easy, expendable simile or image (""Flip like pancakes""). 9th Wonder offers dutiful compositions, sticking to escalating woodwinds, and whiny, spring-loaded strings. Similar to his work on Little Brother's albums, 9th Wonder is a prodigy when it comes to vocal samples. The cooed hook on ""No Future"" glides like a flexed muscle in between the tin twinkles and tapped snares. ""Just Display"" has a smaller, more piecemeal vocal loop, but even there, 9th sneaks it into song's negative space, keeping the griddle-synths from overwhelming the sample.
    </p><p>
    But even with 9th's craftsmanship, the melodies, like Buckshot's lyrics are vacuum-sealed. There's a pianissimo modesty that positively sucks the album dry. Even Buckshot sounds like he knows how bland they are: ""Steak and potatoes, all I need is gravy."" The urge to not overwhelm one's partner is a good one, but there has to be some sense of imbalance, of strain or push, to make a partnership more than an endless parade of door holding and back-patting. <em>The Formula</em> never dares to expose a dynamic between 9th Wonder and Buckshot. All we get is a happy partnership-- inert, consistent and imminently forgettable.

From its opening bass and distorted organ licks, there's no question that <em>Ghost Games</em> is an Apes record.  But the band's substantial personnel shift (former singer Paul Weil being replaced by new guy Breck Brunson) has not only changed their voice, it's changed their entire vibe as well.</p><p>
    Technically speaking, the difference between Weil's rhythmic bark and Brunson's high-pitched wail is fairly obvious.  But there's a more ineffable difference between the two: Weil always seemed to relish in the goofiness of his lyrics, while Brunson seems to be more into keeping the fourth wall intact.  Brunson's vocals are at once more earnest and more arrogant; it's the difference between flashing a grin at the audience and closing your eyes to say ""<em>check this shit out</em>."" Which isn't necessarily a good thing or a bad thing.</p><p>
    The band hasn't quite adjusted its approach to its new singer. While Weil's unhinged persona added adrenaline to the steady and regular riffing of his bandmates, Brunson's melodic wailing leaves the band sounding less propulsive and intense.   Indeed, while short melodic figures (I believe the kids are calling them ""riffs"" these days) are at the core of their music, Apes have always seemed
    like a band that is fundamentally driven by rhythm and energy.
    Sometimes Brunson's more broadly melodic approach doesn't interact all that well with the music underneath it; in ""Walk Thru Walls"", Brunson dutifully follows the band, but his vocals seem detached and disconnected.</p><p>
    Still, Apes have more than their fair share of great songs under their belt with Weil fronting them, and Brunson's presence does seems to have reinvigorated them in places.  In ""Info Ghost"", Brunson's croony swagger actually works well against the band's insistent bashing, creating a kind of rhythmic tension that has never really graced an Apes record.  At times, Brunson's vocals bring to mind Jeff Buckley's more rockin' moments, but the songs themselves rarely serve to highlight his performances.</p><p>
    There's no shortage of bands throwing around ghostly thematic material and dabbling in heavy riffs.  But Apes are no dabblers, and <em>Ghost</em> shows a band moving even further away from stylistic equivocation. Apes are going to be a vaguely horror-themed riff-rock band whether you like it or not, and more power to 'em. It's hard to begrudge a band a transitional record when its in the midst of a substantial transition, and Apes wear it better than most.  The second full-length from the Apes Mk I was far and away their best; here's hoping the band's new incarnation follows suit.</p></div>"|11528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11528-ghost-games/|6.2|Matt LeMay

When these side endeavors become ongoing concerns, however, they lose some of their inherent charm-- especially if, like Witch, they're doing what lots of other groups have already done. And so <em>Paralyzed</em> might be harder and (in sound and in spirit) grungier, but it only goes to show that there's a world of difference between imitation and inspiration.</p><p>
    As they did on their debut, Witch brazenly flog metal's standard sound and standard tropes: fast living, witchy women, bad trips, trippy myth-making, and whatever other bummed-out stereotypes they can pack and smoke.  If the song's called ""Gone"" or ""Mutated"", you know what you're going to get. For the sake of convenience, they often stuff two or three of these themes into the same song-- the best is ""1000 MPH"", which envisions a crossroads where Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"" and White Zombie's ""Black Sunshine"" collide like lava lamp bubbles to form a zippy tune about a girl whose pedal is forever floored.  That said, giving tracks ridiculously obvious names like ""Space God"" and ""Psychotic Rock"" begs the question of whether these guys are having fun or making fun.</p><p>
    Regardless of intent, the <em>sound</em> of <em>Paralyzed</em> is an improvement on the group's eponymous offering.  Producer Justin Pizzoferrato opts to move away from the clean, crisp backdrop <em>Witch</em>'s John Agnello established.  The lack of a ""Planet Caravan""-esque diversion (like ""Isadora"") might disappoint some-- the closest they come here to any sort of balladry is the thudding ""Sweet Sue""-- but the decision to just rock straight on through complements Pizzoferrato's choices.  Every track sits beneath a murky haze and welcome coat of fuzz to the endless parade of pitch-perfect drum rolls and guitar solos.
    </p><p>
    Pizzoferrato's approach also takes attention away from Kyle Thomas' voice, which is a definite plus.  I don't mean to unjustly knock Thomas' singing-- it's fine for what it is, and it's not like many stoner standard bearers were blessed with golden-throated frontmen-- but placing his nasal moan front and center on <em>Witch</em> didn't do the group any favors.  He has his less-than-flattering moments-- the rave-up outro to ""Psychotic Rock"" being Exhibit A-- but otherwise he's perfectly serviceable.  But therein lies part of the album's problem-- the needs serviced by Witch have been serviced plenty of times before.  Unless you're a J Mascis completist, or are in desperate need for a watered-down stoner fix, <em>Paralyzed</em> is a well-intentioned bummer that should be left well enough alone.

But beyond all the plaudits and praise, you can most easily tell the National have made it to the top because there are so many people complaining they don't belong there. Alas, these days backlash is the true mark of the winner.</p><p>
    Still, not every victory deserves a victory lap. A slot touring with R.E.M. and Modest Mouse was healthy reward enough; in comparison, <em>The Virginia</em> EP, and in particular its companion film <em>A Skin, A Night</em>, feel unnecessary. One problem is that little on <em>The Virginia</em> is actually new or even unreleased. Rather, the EP works as a sort of souvenir, a reminder of the band's many highs over the course of the past several months, even if little on the disc actually comes close to matching those highs. Certainly it's less dull and disorienting than Vincent Moon's erstwhile doc <em>A Skin, A Night</em>, which comes off a belated electronic press kit. Were the band (or more likely its label) aware of the impact <em>Boxer</em> would later make, <em>A Skin, A Night</em> is the kind of thing that would have been sent out to drum up interest in a potential breakthrough act. Coming now, it's more than a little redundant and often boring. We know how the story ends, and the rudimentary sketches of <em>Boxer</em>'s beginning don't exactly broaden its scope.</p><p>
    The three songs that kick off <em>The Virginia</em> EP would have made a pretty fine single themselves, with ""You've Done It Again, Virginia"", the stately (and Sufjan Stevens-adorned) selling point, bolstered by the tougher ""Santa Clara"" and the brooding ""Blank Slate"". ""Mansion on the Hill"" is an odd cover choice to draw from Bruce Springsteen's tailor-made-for-the-National <em>Nebraska</em>; at least the group does a nice job rearranging the song to suit its strengths. Of the demos included, ""Tall Saint"" seems closest to fruition. ""Forever After Days"" and ""Rest of Years"" less so, though comparing the demo of ""Slow Show"" to what ended up on <em>Boxer</em>, one suspects both those works in progress could have eventually made the cut. What's left are an unremarkable Charlotte Martin cover, ""Without Permission"", and a handful of live tracks and radio sessions: ""Lucky You"" is a welcome reminder to newcomers that there was a National even before <em>Alligator</em>, while versions of ""Fake Empire"" and ""About Today"" adequately capture the mix of poignancy and pathos that make the National so thrilling live. </p><p>
    But that's just what's missing here: the thrills. In fact, there's something even anti-climatic about <em>The Virginia</em> EP. Coming from a band powerful enough to change lives on the stereo or make you feel more alive while on stage, it seems oddly perfunctory. Not slapped together per se, but lacking the cohesive strength of <em>Boxer</em> proper. That's to be expected. That's what B-sides are typically for, after all-- material that for one reason or another is not quite A-level-- and indeed much of <em>The Virginia</em> previously made its way to various singles and other outlets.  Yet taken together, these demos and live tracks don't add up to much more than a reminder that the finished product was much better than the sketches, and that the live tracks are no substitute for catching the band in person.</p></div>"|11533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11533-the-virginia-ep/|4.3|Joshua Klein

The beat for ""What Up Man"" is classic minimal 808-heavy mid-1980s shit, the sort of thing Rick Rubin might've spent 10 minutes slapping together for an LL Cool J B-side, except that in place of actual hi-hat ticks and handclaps, we get the words <em>tick</em> and <em>clap</em> (and <em>bass</em>). That pretty much perfectly encapsulates the Chicago duo's approach right there: They semi-faithfully recreate the music of rap's low-budget bubbling-under era, but they do it with eyebrows arched and quotation-marks firmly in place. On ""88"", they make their aims explicit: ""Do the smurf, do the wop, baseball bat/ Rooftop like we bringing 88 back,"" itself a quote from an unashamedly retro 2002 Nas single.</p><p>
    Mikey Rocks, the younger of the two Cool Kids, was born in 1988. But Cool Kids' 1988 revivalism doesn't rankle the same way that, say, Jurassic 5's 1981 revivalism can, largely because Mikey and partner Chuck Inglish never slap you over the head with the inherent superiority of the era they're reviving. Or: The Cool Kids don't rap about how hard they are, and they don't rap about how they don't rap about how hard they are. Instead, they mostly rap about how fly they are, which is fertile territory. Hearing the Cool Kids rap about their haircuts is sort of like hearing a circa-now rockabilly band singing about their pompadours. And that's fun. Songs about haircuts are fun.</p><p>
    That retro-clothes fixation has gotten the Cool Kids widely tagged as ""hipster rap,"" an understood pejorative of deep meaninglessness. That term ignores the musical intelligence at work on <em>The Bake Sale</em>. The EP's beats, all self-produced, are all empty space, melody implied by the barest hints of synth-bass, every drum-machine woodblock-tunk impeccably timed. That gives the two rappers plenty of room to play. Mikey and Chuck both have the easy charisma and calm nonchalance to sell even their clunkiest punchlines. Their boasts tend toward the cartoonish, which suits them just fine: ""I could build a sandcastle without bringing a pail/ And go catfish fishing and come up with a whale."" And they're unshowy enough with their twisty internal rhymes that you might not at first notice the intricacies of a line like this one: ""Fly propellers propel us to the angels/ Repelling the fellas that's jealous of the name.""</p><p>
    Of course, given that the Cool Kids don't concern themselves with much beyond the clothes they're wearing, there's precious little urgency to be found on the EP. The two never sound more committed than when they're playing up their own trendsetting abilities, and even that comes with a self-aware wink: ""I'm 'bout to say 'screw it'/ And grow a jheri curl, wear a diaper like Cupid/ Or something else stupid/ And see if people do it."" And they only break out of their spacey thud-rap pastiche style a couple of times: with the Miami bass pastiche of ""Bassment Party"" and the tumbling-break Marley Marl pastiche of ""What It Is"". Those self-imposed limits might wear a bit thin over the course of a full-length album, but the 10-track, half-hour running time of <em>The Bake Sale</em> is about perfect. Give or take the occasional 12"", <em>The Bake Sale</em> is the first commercially available product from a group that's built its rep via MySpace and live shows, and most of these tracks have been floating around the internet for a long minute. But it makes for a great little introduction to two guys who know exactly what they're doing and who do it well.</p></div>"|11518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11518-the-bake-sale-ep/|7.8|Tom Breihan

Maybe that's harsh. You undoubtedly learned things, but the picture of history-- especially recent history-- you get in school is essentially a massive connect-the-dots mural with only a fraction of the dots connected and none of the colors filled in. You have to work to do the rest, and that's one of the reasons I love compilations like this. It helps you fill in a part of the picture that you never even thought to look at. It's a 16-track compilation of soul music, sure, but it's intertwined with the histories of Israel, Liberia, the Black Hebrew movement, Zionist emigration, and black art and culture in Chicago.</p><p>
    The music on this disc was all recorded in Israel, made by a group of black expatriate Americans living in the Negev Desert city of Dimona. I can't give a full history of the Black Hebrew movement(s) here, but suffice to say that it tied together aspects of Judaism, black nationalism as first articulated by Marcus Garvey, and Zionism; South Chicago's Black Hebrew leader, Ben Ammi Carter, saw Garvey's back-to-Africa concept as a step on the way to settling in the Promised Land itself, Israel.</p><p>
    The path from Chicago to Dimona was a winding one, and it ran partly through the recording studios of Chicago, where many of the musicians heard here first connected with each other in the Metrotones, an extraordinary studio band that played on dozens of hit 45s in the mid-60s. As certain musicians in the group became more involved in the movement, they also began plans to emigrate to Liberia, where they turned to music as a way to earn a living when economic prospects in their settlement turned from dim to downright grim. The move was made in 1967, and the Soul Messengers, as they were christened, were possibly the first group to play James Brown's ""Cold Sweat"" in Africa, while Geraldo Pino, Orlando Julius, and Fela Kuti were all still working highlife grooves.
    </p><p>
    Touring West Africa proved too difficult and unrewarding to continue (In his Black Hebrew memoir <em>From Night to Sunlight</em>, Thomas ""Yehuda"" Whitfield described a harrowing incident in the Ivory Coast in which he and bandmate John Boyd were taken captive and nearly killed during one particularly awful trip), and the settlement in Liberia dispersed to Israel and the U.S. Boyd and Whitfield returned to America, but ultimately joined their brethren in Dimona in 1972. The Soul Messengers, restocked with members from within the community, boosted their popularity by playing military gigs free of charge during the Yom Kippur War. The Soul Messengers were augmented by satellite acts, the female vocal group Spirit of Israel, the teen duo the Tonistics, and ultimately a male vocal group called the Sons of the Kingdom. 
    </p>
<p>
    All are featured on this compilation. In one sense, this is something of a summary of Numero's explorations of the unlit corners of soul history. It has religious funk, rough-edged disco, singing children, eccentric soul, communal living arrangements, shoestring budgets, Black Hebrew tie-ins, psychedelic touches, altered identities, and lots of quality music that never got exposed as it might have. The variety is astounding, especially considering that it's the same basic group of musicians playing all the backing tracks. 
    </p>
<p>
    The Soul Messengers tracks range from a discofied semi-cover of Steam's ""Na Na Na (Kiss Him Goodbye)"" with Hebrew lyrics to funked-up jazz on ""Prince of Zeal"". ""Messiah"" is a brilliant, slow-burning psychedelic soul track with a ramshackle horn arrangement and an impassioned, subtle vocal, and ""Savior in the East"" is even more acid-damaged, with wah-wah guitars nipping at the edges of its Afrofunk beat and dubwise effects tripping out the vocal hooks. The most jaw-dropping groove on the disc, though, belongs to ""Victory"", a hard-hitting, high-tempo drum, bass, and horn workout; as an instrumental, it's not explicitly spreading the Black Hebrew gospel, but sometimes you don't need words to preach. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not surprisingly, this band provided stellar backing for its collaborators. The Spirit of Israel tracks are the most overtly gospel. ""Daniel"" has a great lead/response vocal arrangement, and the strangely lo-fi way the backing singers are recorded gives the otherwise hi-fi recording a weird, arresting quality. The young Tonistics sang beyond their years, and their tribute to Dimona, ""Dimona (Spiritual Capital of the World)"", is about as effervescent as kid soul songs come, with honeyed backing vocals from the Spirit of Israel.
    </p>
<p>
    The Sons of the Kingdom's two tracks are a mixed bag. ""Hey There"" is a great slice of smoothly funky harmony soul, but their hysterical denunciation of modern life, ""Modernization"", is a rather ham-handed bit of alarmist social critique with an awkward groove and vocal arrangement. One interesting dud is a small price to pay for such an amazing clutch of forgotten gems, though. This is a solid, solid disc, and if you're allergic to religious music don't worry-- this music was specifically designed as a gateway to Black Hebrew thought and is often surprisingly secular or at least vague in its religiousness. Its value is enhanced, however, by the fact that it fills in a small bit of the story of the black American separatism and spirituality.

They could swoon like Tindersticks, chew scenery like Nick Cave, scrape and seethe like Black Heart Procession. But the question remained: Were they simply the sum of their parts?  2006's <em>Coal </em>was satisfying, but it was difficult to figure what the band brought to their sound that was truly specific to them.</p><p>
    On their third album, <em>Yes, U</em>, all of the aforementioned touchstones remain in Devastations' RIYL line, but they've refashioned their influences at the structural level to create a sound that's both classic and singular. It breaks the band's previously narrow influential line, conjuring up affinities as far-flung as Castanets (an oneiric, dirge-like quality) and Luomo (the carefully arrayed and proportioned space). The music oozes like a lava lamp, and its intuitive progression allows for these kinds of evocative-not-literal associations, significantly broadening its scope.</p><p>
<em>Yes, U</em> forgoes overt verses and choruses in favor of long, unraveling vamps; tempest-in-a-teacup tensions that simmer and boil over; slow-burning bump'n'grinds. It favors restrained power over the raw variety, so the pressurized bass lines round off smoothly, tricked-out cymbal hisses protract crisply, harmonies hover, flanged guitar lines nearly vanish while riotous choked-throttle ones rev up, and sheets of synthesizer ripple. Nothing is left to chance yet these songs feel inspired and organic. ""Black Ice"" sinks a pointillist grid of hand percussion and bass into a suspension of guitar and keyboard tones, as comb-filtered synth filaments whiz through it like electrical currents. Nothing on <em>Coal </em>felt so alive, and as the first track on <em>Yes, U</em>, it's a winning introduction to the new Devastations. Lest we think ""Black Ice"" a novelty, ""Oh Me, Oh My"" follows it with nearly eight minutes of blissed-out kraut-gospel, with a motorik thud buried in sprays of lunar dissonance and curtains of icicle chimes. ""Rosa"" rides a dark wave of three-pronged bass stabs toward its cacophonous climax, and ""The Pest"" bends quicksilver guitar distortion around a hypnotically static pulse.
    </p><p>
    The instrumentation threatens to steal the show yet the vocals-- once central to Devastations' music-- still remain significant. Bassist Conrad Standish and guitarist Tom Carlyon are the primary singers, and while Standish's ghoulish baritone is more striking, both men invest the music with an air of urbane dread that suits its introverted histrionics. They murmur hangdog appeals to absent divinities, write valentines in black blood, issue barbed proclamations that we're not meant to believe: ""I'm so interested in life,"" goes one deadpanned global kiss-off. Seldom do disinterest, world-weariness, and depression sound so interesting, worldly, and darkly euphoric.

    Movin' on up/ To the Upper West Side/ To that club gig show in the sky. It's a familiar script: Brooklyn quartet Flying broke out in 2006 with their self-recorded debut <em>Just-One-Second-Ago Broken Eggshell</em>, which crackled with the sort of electricity that occurs when too many kids-- well, three, anyway-- enter a room with too many instruments. What follows is a new label-- Menlo Park-- a sophomore effort, <em>Faces of the Night</em>, recorded out of pocket at Illinois' Keyclub Recording Co., and presumably a larger touring profile. The hangup, of course, is Flying sound slower, denser, and less like a dynamic Brooklyn skewering of twee and more properly like wannabe residents of Athens, Geo., or Olympia, Wash.</p><p>
    This isn't selling out, of course, but the refinements are disappointing. Vocals are introduced in entirely conventional manners; there seem to be ""vehicles"" for each of the band members-- Sara Magenheimer's adolescent coo and then the three more indistinguishable males: Eliot Krimsky, Eben Portnoy, and new member Mike Johnson-- rather than the tactical ""if you're near a mic, sing""-approach of the first album. Out-of-tune bits sound less like interludes gone haywire and more like songs sung out of tune. No longer do woodpeckers interrupt or claptrap drums rock, then roll. The arrangement scream ""A lot of thought went into this!""; creating art this way is noble but it ultimately distances Flying from their most productive impulses.<em></em></p><p>
<em>Faces</em> is not devoid of sparkly, inspired moments. ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/48152-flying-stains-videomp3"">Stains</a></strong>"" is built on a funk riff that stops only for Mt. Eerie-lite harmonies.  ""One-Eyed Son"" opens the album with a cartoony boing-ing sound effect promptly mimicked by a festive acoustic guitar and a vocal melody that sounds like it's rocking in a chair with an uneven leg. On ""Draw It in the Dark"" Magenheimer does her best Moe Tucker impression over a pleasantly arepeggiating guitar: ""I'm Sticking to You"" airbrushed onto a Lisa Frank folder. Still, too many reminders of how weirdly linear Flying have become: ""Fear of Flying"" switches from a beatific drum machine pat to Sufjan Stevens' plaintive piano chording to a major key organ drone and finally to choppy guitar strumming, but each section's execution is Catholic. ""Firetruck""'s bassline sounds like corkscrewed big-tent music but it carries on for four minutes before an electric guitar and some reverberated ""ahh ahh""'s ride the song out for another two, producing the sort of watch-glancing length the Flying wisely avoid elsewhere. Other songs-- ""Poor Simone"", ""The Wrong Hearts"", ""Double-Hearted Clown""-- plod without event.  
    </p>
<p>
    Flying are well within their rights attempting this transformation, of course, but their move from avant-pop that fused Brooklyn's best out-music tendencies to four-track bedroom twee to careerist indie pop is an acutely stinging injustice. The most disappointing aspect of <em>Faces of the Night</em>-- especially in light of their debut-- is that it seems sustainable. Probably good for them, you know, in the long run.

Maybe that's not so strange, since the best in any scene is rarely the biggest. What's odd is, before grunge's breakthrough, Mudhoney were pretty huge. Their brain-shaking 1988 single ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" was a definite indie rock hit-- at that year's CMJ Conference, so many people asked me if I had heard it that I nearly got a complex. A follow-up six-song EP, <em>Superfuzz Bigmuff</em>, was almost as popular, and certainly as good. At the time, it seemed a foregone conclusion that Mudhoney would make grunge big.</p><p>
    Why Nirvana did so instead is no mystery, but the indelible mark left on indie rock by Mudhoney's first few records shouldn't be obscured. While the impact was partially due to buzz and circumstance, it came mostly because the music killed. Rising from the ashes of sludge-masters Green River, Mudhoney blurted a Technicolor yawn of 60s garage, Stooges-style howl, Jimi Hendrix fuzz, post-Black Flag steam, and proto-slacker slop. And they wrapped it in a blissfully primal package-- as animalistic as Iggy, with even less pretense. In 1988, Mudhoney were cool, especially because it didn't sound like they wanted to be.</p><p>
    ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" and <em>Superfuzz Bigmuff</em> are still powerful two decades later: Steve Turner's guitar bleeding over ""Twenty Four"", Mark Arm's screams pumping the veins of ""No One Has"", Dan Peters filling every open drum space in ""Burn It Clean""-- none of it has been diminished by time. That's evidenced by Sub Pop's deluxe 2xCD set, which adds singles, compilation tracks, and demos, plus two fine live sets from winter 1988. Three versions of ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" all slay, but it was with follow-up single ""You Got It (Keep It Outta My Face)"" that Mudhoney peaked. The tune's lopsided sway is both urgent and half-awake, like a muttering drunk who blows your mind with off-handed profundity. An all-together-now ""Fuck you!"" at the end is Mudhoney in a nutshell-- they're laughing cause they really mean it, and vice versa.</p><p>
    While the smoke from these records was still clearing, Mudhoney released a pair of excellent, underappreciated full-lengths, 1989's <em>Mudhoney</em> and 1991's <em>Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge</em>. Both offered gems approaching the best of <em>Superfuzz Bigmuff</em>. But they also exuded a modest, workman-like feel, indicating the band was headed towards a solid career unlikely to diverge from its quickly-beaten path. Five more albums over the next 14 years kept the flag flying, suffering only from a lack of surprise. Mudhoney got perhaps too good at being Mudhoney, able to churn out solid songs so effortlessly they've rarely felt the need to stretch their boundaries.</p><p>
    No envelopes are pushed on the quartet's latest, <em>The Lucky Ones</em>. But there's an increase in firepower that makes it their best effort in a while. That's especially true of the first three songs, a head-spinning block that nearly matches the snap of Mudhoney's prime. The chugging ""I'm Now"" tears the air, while ""Inside Out Over You"" marries Billy Childish stomp to Dinosaur Jr. slouch, and ""The Lucky Ones"" rides Turner's high-rev fuzz. Lyrically, Arm seems acutely aware of time. ""The past made no sense/ The future looks tense"" he snarls in ""I'm Now"", and later he envies those spared time's march: ""The lucky ones have already gone down/ The lucky ones are lucky they're not around.""</p><p>
    The album sags a bit in the middle, offering competent but not particularly memorable tunes. But Mudhoney rips through the last few tracks as convincingly as they did the opening three. On closer ""New Meaning"", over another searing Turner guitar line, a happily-hoarse Arm defends the band's continued relevance: ""I've got new meaning, baby/ Don't you take it away."" That new meaning may be same as the old meaning, but the fact that this hard-working band still means something is impressive-- and, based on <em>The Lucky Ones</em>, difficult to deny.</p></div>"|11680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11680-superfuzz-bigmuff-deluxe-editionthe-lucky-ones/|9.1|Marc Masters

    This should be a victory lap for Islands. After all, their uniformly excellent debut resuscitated Paul Simon's <em>Graceland</em> as an indie pop touchstone back when Vampire Weekend were still playing in the quad. And with that album's bouncy calypso rhythms and hip-hop bursts, Jaime Thompson and Nick Thorburn (previously known by their <em>noms de rock</em> J'aime Tambeur and Nick Diamonds), succeeded in laying to rest the ghost of their beloved former group, the Unicorns. Since then, they have honed their breezy, buoyant sound on the road, and, despite Thompson's departure from the lineup, the Montreal-based sextet seemed on the verge of a major breakthrough, as demonstrated by moving from tiny indie label Equator to Anti-, home of such classy ""career"" acts as Nick Cave and Billy Bragg. But <em>Arm's Way</em>, which does away with the musical levity and genre experimentations of <em>Return to the Sea</em>, is much darker and more conventional than its predecessor, and not, unfortunately, to its benefit.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Islands' new obsession with darkness does, however, make sense. The throughline between all of Thorburn's records (with Islands and the Unicorns) is a lyrical obsession with death in all of its forms-- from the corporal (bones) to the metaphysical (ghosts)-- so it was only a matter of time until his band tried to match its outward sound to the inner themes. Gone are the guest rappers, the acoustic nuevo-country twang, and the sunny Afro-Caribbean flourishes (though there are still a few brief flashes of them, as on chugging rocker ""J'aime Vous Voire Quitter"", which, two minutes in, implodes into a Bahamian ""La Bamba"" breakdown). In their place are theatrical string arrangements, layers of silvery, minor-key guitars, and lots of gothy synthesizers. <span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    To be fair, almost any record would suffer by comparison to their breathless first one. These songs may be less immediately catchy, but all of them have a moment in which they break away from their straightforward guitar-rock underpinning and allow strange, spacious moments to burble up from within. On ""Creeper"", the most memorable sing-along here, it's when the stomping 80s guitar melody briefly gives way to off-kilter bursts of steel drum. On ""Abominable Snow"", a song which predates <em>Return to the Sea</em>, it's a winsome vocal interlude that's nestled before the final crashing chorus-- a breathy call-and-response waltz that's laid against elegant violin embellishments and delicate guitar pulses. And on the record's best song, ""In the Rushes"", it comes after five minutes of tightly coiled build-up driven by sawing strings and Thorburn's choked, whispery warble, when the song explodes into major-key harmonies, galloping guitars, and sweetly twinkling glockenspiels. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Thorburn is an imaginative songwriter and his voice (both literally and figuratively) has always been unusual. Though he often overstuffs his compositions, sometimes that excess works to his advantage. Rambling opener ""The Arm"", which navigates terrain that's both spare and baroque, is better off for its sprawl. Its melody matures as it encompasses soaring strings, moments of prickly pizzicato and a welcome section of last-album levity that marries golden harmonies to bright polyrhythms. Islands are at their best when they are weird. And there is plenty of weirdness on <em>Arm's Way</em>-- like 11-minute, three-movement album closer, ""Vertigo (If It's a Crime)"", and its trial-to-gallows plotline-- but it's bracketed by much more rock pomp than was expected or (probably) necessary. Bravo to the band for sidestepping the trap of trying to replicate a winning debut; if only the resulting sophomore effort didn't so blatantly feel like a losing effort.

The Baltimore based trio's sophomore record
    is loaded with grunts, howls, and guttural utterances rather than formal verse.
    Melodic contributions generally range from the pulse of a single repeated organ
    note to the thin and atonal skittering of a guitar. But all of these noisy
    hijinks are hung on a solid skeleton of killer rhythm. Drummer Elke KW is not a precision player. There are a few moments on <em>Terrible
    Two</em> where she seems poised to wander beyond the beat and off into stumbling
    entropy. But there's definitely a bit of prog-rock's ""more is
    more"" philosophy to her rhythms. If you wrote out a drum score for album
    opener ""Empty Legs"" it would probably just be a grid of thick black
    bars. KW crams a note into every available opening, leaving only enough space
    for bandmates Michael Bouyoucas and Jeffrey McGrath to pedal bass notes on an
    organ and blow a few whistles. Rather than being crowded and indulgent, however,
    the result is invigorating-- a tidal wave of tribal throb and primitive yowl
    that bursts with energy for its entire six-minute duration.</p><p>
    If Thank You have a working method, it's montage. ""Self With
    Yourself"" begins with undulating snare and hi-hat syncopations, then
    breaks into cascading tom rolls, only to close with the halted splash of cymbal
    catches. Once a rhythm has been explored to the band's satisfaction they just
    ditch it and move on to the next and never look back. Thank You aren't making
    dance music-- at least in any traditional way-- but in a structural sense, they
    borrow from it. <em>Terrible Two</em>'s compositions seem like they've been DJed
    into existence from a collection of the band's favorite This Heat and OOIOO
    breaks.</p><p>
    Between the cluttered rhythms, the speechless chanting, and unrelenting
    spasms of guitar noise, <em>Terrible Two</em> packs a lot of diffuse information.
    Credit has to be given to J. Robbins (who engineered) and Chris Coady (who
    mixed) for filtering all of the buzz into a coherent picture. Each drum hit is
    given its own sonic space and it's own roomy reverb-- not one detail gets lost
    in the din. And there's a lot of din here.
    </p><p>
    On the title track and final song, Thank You's manic energy starts to wind
    down. A curtain of cymbal washes gradually evolves into a subdued and cyclical
    rhythm, mildly affected with dubbed-out filters. Samples and organ drones
    stream lazily in and out. There's a sense that Thank You are gradually leading
    you by the hand toward some wild spiritual epiphany. However, that epiphany
    might be just as simple as this: More art-punks should develop drum chops.

    The first sound you hear on Silje Nes' debut album, <em>Ames Room</em>, is an ascending cascade of gulps,
    like water pouring out of a jug. In proper pitch, they could be a factory
    setting on a keyboard, but Nes (first name pronounced seel-YAH) modifies them
    slightly to sound more percussive and completely otherworldly. Those gulps
    appear throughout <em>Ames Room</em>, one of
    several repeating sounds-- like her shimmery guitar tone and soft vocals,
    reminiscent of múm's Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir-- that
    could be one instrument in a more traditional band lineup. But Nes recorded the
    album by herself in her Bergen
    apartment (well, almost by herself: Ungdomskulen's Kristian Stockhaus appears
    on one song), using an array of instruments and equipment, some of which she
    either found or constructed herself. Creating the album was a solitary pursuit,
    but unlike many bedroom auteurs who try to make one musician sound like many,
    Nes crafts music that actually reflects that isolation: <em>Ames Room</em> sounds like it's emanating from deep within her
    imagination.</p><p>
    Even so, her aesthetic isn't stripped down or lo-fi. Her
    complexly layered compositions are dense with loops, synths, cello, drums,
    guitar, and a cacophony of unidentifiable sounds. ""Magnetic Moments of Spinning
    Objects"" builds a music-box lullaby against the high, abrasive whir of a
    rewinding tape. The two elements don't match up, but that may be the point: As
    muted as <em>Ames Room</em> often is, Nes seems
    less interested in making pretty sounds than in setting up experiments in
    conceptual dissonance. Most of the instrumental tracks are shapelessly ambient.
    ""Shapes, Electric"" establishes a lulled rhythm from the molten sounds of flute,
    wordless vocals, acoustic guitars, and what sound like sheep, all coalescing
    into a percussive time-keeping device that usually sounds like it's perpetually
    winding down. Similarly, ""No Bird Can"" closes the album with the sound of Nes
    blowing simple notes on bottles (presumably), backed by a typewriter clacking
    away in the next room.</p><p>
    Other tracks on <em>Ames
    Room</em> are more structured, featuring Nes' ghostly vocals half-submerged in
    the music and her similarly piecemeal approach to lyrics. ""Drown"" consists
    mainly of one line-- ""We'll bring the water to the sea once more""-- repeated
    against spectral guitars, as if she made a tape of turning the phrase over in
    her head. She crafts an elegant, catchy melody on ""Ames Room"", the most direct
    and fully realized song on the album, and ""Giant Disguise"" grafts her vocals to
    a snappy guitar line that sounds like a pop riff on cough syrup. With its
    bouncing momentum and crisp guitars, ""Dizzy Street""
    could be a Clientele song, at least until she starts singing in her strange
    whisper. <em>Ames Room</em> may be an essay on
    the possibilities of home recording, but these songs, simultaneously succinct
    and discursive, portray her more as a pop musician than as a sound tinkerer.

    rocks just the one iconic name. And like logorrheic, New York-based
    folk-popsters Regina Spektor, Nellie McKay, and Casey Dienel, she sings winsome,
    quasi-confessional songs that the linguistically lazy probably tag ""quirky"",
    but that never get within spitting distance of ""weird,"" let alone
    ""challenging."" You know, Sirius Coffee House playlist fodder and the
    gauze that NPR packs between <em>All Things Considered</em> segments. Jaymay even has an
    iPod-ad ready track in ""You Are the Only One I Love"", a sweet
    ramshackled sparkler of a song replete with singalong chorus and children's
    choir, lacking only the choreography. Do I really need to mention that Jaymay
    worked New York's open-mic circuit, developing an ""underground""
    following, before a major label (EMI-owned Blue Note) came calling?</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Right, then. Key marketing messages, RIYL shortcuts, and
    inevitable female singer-songwriter baggage unpacked and put away, let's talk
    about <em>Autumn Fallin'</em> on its own terms. As far as debut LPs go (Jaymay
    previously self-released an EP) it's not bad. It also isn't likely to sway
    anyone not already leaning in its subway-busking direction, either. A couple
    of relatively unadorned girl-with-guitar numbers, ""Big Ben"" and the
    title track, barely venture out of the beige range of their musical and
    emotional spectrums. And ""Sea Green See Blue"" and ""Ill Willed
    Person"" are the kind of pleasant, generic tunes you enjoy well enough as
    they play but forget as soon as the last note wafts out of the speaker. None of these, however, are as
    unfortunate as the cabaret-lite ""Hard to Say"", which finds Jaymay
    scatting trumpet sounds-- something no one whose name isn't Ella Fitzgerald
    should even think about trying.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    That said, ""You'd Rather Run"", a hyper-verbose,
    10-minute verse-piled-on-verse breakup song, with its waltzing Wurlitzer and
    descending keyboard crawls, is marvelous-- superbly arranged, psychologically
    nuanced, and wonderfully witty. Jaymay pays respectable homage to hero Bob
    Dylan (and god knows, greater musicians than she have failed there) with
    harmonica sputters and lacerating lyrics that bleed an ex dry with papercuts
    (""It's not that I hate you/ I never loved you enough to hate you,/ You moved to
    Montreal to be closer to France/ How's that working out?""). But with its emotionally
    ambivalent air of jaded rue, ""Run"" calls Leonard Cohen godfather as
    well.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Other album apogees include ""Blue Skies"", a
    diamond-chiseled orchestral pop gem of deceptively sunny sangfroid, and the
    breezy xylophone and shaker-salted album opener ""Gray or Blue"". But
    as good as these tracks are, ultimately, they don't recompense for <em>Autumn
    Fallin's</em> bland stretches. And unfortunately, Jaymay has yet to, uh, effectively
    communicate her competitive advantage in what has become an overcrowded market.

    The very idea of Scarlett Johansson's debut album has been
    met with a strange collective kneejerk dismissal, not so much because she's an
    actor making a foray into music, but she's a <em>good</em>
    actor making a foray into music. The Bijou Phillipses and David Hasselhoffs of the
    world, the Lindsay Lohans and Don Johnsons, have trained us to think the worst
    of dabblers and dilettantes. But Scarlett
    comes from an already storied cinema career-- <em>Ghost
    World, Lost in Translation</em>, and <em>Match Point</em> among the highlights-- so we assume she has better taste than to do
    something as gauchely commercial as make an album. Moreover, the concept behind
    the album-- a collection of Tom Waits covers-- might have bought her some
    sympathy and at least a little curiosity, but instead it seems almost comically
    ambitious, an endeavor that even most non-actress musicians couldn't pull off
    (see: Holly Cole). What could the star of <em>The
    Island</em> ever tell us about Waits that we didn't already know? Waits himself
    never got so much grief for appearing in studio bombs like <em>Mystery Men</em> or <em>The Two Jakes</em>.</p><p>
    Johansson's affection for Waits' music, however, is unmistakable.
    Instead of obvious picks, <em>Anywhere I Lay My Head</em> reveals an artist with more than a passing
    familiarity with his work. These songs-- culled from later Waits albums like 1992's
    <em>Bone Machine</em> and 2002's <em>Alice</em>, with only one track from the
    1970s-- sound like personal favorites, and to respectfully reinterpret them, she
    and producer David Sitek corralled a backing band that includes the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner and
    members of TV on the Radio, Tall Firs, and Celebration. Sitek proves as strong
    a presence as Johansson herself, swaddling her voice in a soft, otherworldly
    drone of bells, saxophones, ambient guitars, and burbling beats that suggest a
    Brooklyn update on vintage 4AD bands like This Mortal Coil or Cocteau Twins
    (without Elizabeth Fraser's vocal acrobatics, of course). As the album
    proceeds, this sound, which Sitek has described as a ""Tinkerbell on cough syrup,""
    becomes a bit repetitive, the same tricks over and over. The drunken music box
    and ambient telephone rings on ""I Wish I Was in New
    Orleans"" sound overly precious, and ""I Don't Wanna
    Grow Up"" never gels in this setting, which may have more to do with song choice
    than production or performance.</p><p>
    Sitek guides <em>Anywhere
    I Lay My Head</em> as much as Waits does. In fact, much of the album sounds like the producer might have devised this particular aesthetic as a softer, feminine
    counterpart to his day-job band's more aggressive, abstract attack. Music boxes
    replace jagged guitars, warm reed instruments displace lunar howls. Of course,
    Johansson doesn't take such liberties with lyrics, leaving many of the
    masculine pronouns unchanged. Still it's startling-- and not unpleasantly so-- to
    hear a guarded female voice sing words and melodies most commonly associated
    with Waits' gruff vocals. With all this gender realignment, David Bowie's
    cameos seem almost inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
    So, how does Johansson herself sound? More expressive and
    less tentative than she did on ""Summertime"", her track from the 2006 Music
    Matters comp <em>Unexpected Dreams: Songs From
    the Stars</em>. While her voice is limited and her pitch occasionally shaky, she
    has a wide textural range, spanning from low, smooth, and melancholy on ""Song
    for Jo"" (the only original, which she co-wrote with Sitek) to bristling and edgy
    on ""Falling Down"", whose melody best suits her voice and Sitek's production. However,
    she sounds blankly inexpressive on ""No One Knows I'm Gone"", overwhelmed by her
    back-up singers on closer ""Who Are You"" and unable to sell Waits' lyrics on
    ""Town with No Cheer""-- a major shortcoming for an actor. Likewise, singing
    about street musicians and red-beans-and-rice on ""I Wish I Was in New
    Orleans"", she's out of her depth. 
    </p>
<p>
    On several songs, Johansson gets lost in Sitek's swelling
    production, which may suggest a weak interpreter or a dearth of vocal personality
    but adds to the album's pervading dreaminess. Ultimately, her ambitions prove
    more musical than professional, and her willingness to make herself a secondary
    player here-- behind Waits, Sitek, and TV on the Radio-- makes the whole
    enterprise seem like a lark, an anti-vanity project. There are no tacky
    pronouncements of stars-are-just-like-you realness here, no statements about
    herself or her celebrity or really anything at all. The only thing we've learned
    about her is that she really, really likes Tom Waits. That's more than enough to
    avoid catastrophe, but not quite enough to make <em>Anywhere I Lay My Head</em> much more than a curio.

    It feels downright, well, <em>uncharitable</em> to critique a compilation put together by environmentally
    responsible do-gooders who are donating their profits to the Energy Action
    Coalition. But, it has to be said, the songs that are collected here have little
    to do with one another. Unlike other similarly diverse anthologies, the bands on
    this comp aren't connected by a unified aesthetic, label, or location; they are
    simply united by virtue of their altruism. How else would Harper ""Son of Paul""
    Simon's dusty, spare ""Henrieta"" end up in a tracklisting with an overblown live
    Muse performance (replete with the noise of a screaming crowd) and an intimate
    Citizens Band gypsy-cabaret act? There is no throughline, no connective tissue
    to bind these tracks together or make listening to them as an ""album""
    necessary. (In fact, you'll wonder if its creators ever made a mixtape before when
    you hear such jarringly disparate songs abutting one another.)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But, while the sequencing may be disorienting, many of the 16 tracks on <em>The Green Owl Comp</em>'s first disc are quite
    good when taken on their own. Of Montreal's
    ""Feminine Effects"", unavailable elsewhere, is a wonderfully torchy piano ballad
    à la Bowie's
    ""Life on Mars"". The contribution by School of Seven Bells, Benjamin
    Curtis' post-Secret Machines band with On!Air!Library! sisters Alejandra and
    Claudia Deheza, is a reverberating march of twinkling effects, glitchy Bjorkian
    rhythms, and insistently echoed drones of womanly harmonies. And Violens, a
    new project featuring Lansing-Dreiden members, may be less than a year old, but
    they are already the best discovery of this collection. Their stoned, sweet ""Trance
    Like Turn"" features sunny, vintage harmonies that peek through the gray clouds
    of their steely, post-punk beats and synthesized aggression. New and
    exclusive-- if unnecessary-- versions of already excellent songs by Feist (<em>The Reminder</em>'s ""Honey Honey""),
    Deerhoof (<em>Friend Opportunity</em>'s
    ""+81""), and Bloc Party (<em>A
    Weekend In The City</em>'s ""The Prayer"") fill out the rest of the disc
    along with a couple of rough-around-the-edges tracks by the Green Owl founders'
    bands (the Appletrees, the Exit).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The second disc bills itself as a bonus, and it's true, most
    of the extras are superfluous. After all, Billy Parish of Energy Action might
    be an environmental hero (so says <em>Rolling
    Stone</em>), but are you really going to watch a video interview with him more
    than once? Ditto the six low-budget music videos. But the additional tracks on
    disc two represent a well-spring of music. Between CSS's buzzing,
    electrifried remix of Asobi Seksu's ""Strawberries"" and the distorted, rhythmic
    antagonism of A Place to Bury Strangers' ""Never Going Down"", some of the
    collection's best songs are confined to this disc, which, I suspect because of
    its video components, I couldn't get to play in anything other than a DVD
    player. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Despite some missteps, Green Owl Records has its heart in
    the right place and its fingers on the pulse. Not only do the folks behind the
    label recognize the need for environmentally friendly music business practices--
    how many CD jewel cases must end up in landfills? Green Owl's packaging is 100% recycled-- but they have pretty good taste in bands too. In your portable
    music player you can remedy their egregious sequencing and ignore the handful
    of less-than-stellar songs. Unfortunately, the best tracks will still be trapped on
    that DVD.

It's possible to make a satisfying collection using either method, but you have to do it right regardless: When diligent research, good sound and good music collide on the same disc, you have the best of all worlds, and something truly worth owning. Jazzman has made something of an art form out of the latter approach with its recent geographically organized survey of impossibly rare funk. <em>Carolina Funk</em> follows on the fine heels of the label's Midwest, Texas, and Florida Funk overviews, dishing out 22 killer sides from late 1960s and early-to-mid-70s North and South Carolina, accompanied by 22 pages of extensive, tiny-type liners that offer more background than most people will know what to do with.</p><p>
    The compilation covers a broad spectrum: There are hard psychedelic funk sides, funky soul songs, murky basement disco grooves, vocal harmonies, and screaming James Brown disciples, all played at skill levels ranging from confidently professional to charmingly amateur. The biggest name on the tracklisting is Carleen &amp; the Groovers, which illustrates just how lost to time most of these tracks were. There are a couple of things seeing their first commercial release, and there is definitely a collector's penchant for rarity at work in the song choices. There's no distinct sound tying all these songs together-- if anything, the opposite is true. If there's a common thread to be found, it's that the vibrant funk scene of the Carolinas was mostly a hyper-local phenomenon, with very few of the featured musicians ever touring or receiving distribution outside their city much less their state.</p><p>
    The disc opens with the ludicrous spoken-word intro to Primitive's ""Creation of Music"", a dorky, faux-Biblical announcement that God created music, in the manner of His famous ""let there be light"" pronouncement. And then it tears up the dance floor with a nasty rhythm guitar, twisting sax, and a burbling bass line. The skeletal groove pioneered by James Brown is all over these songs, and these bands play it hard, the often roughshod production only serving to highlight the attack of each scratchy guitar chord or well-hit snare. There are two direct homages to Carolina's #1 soul brother (JB was born in South Carolina) in Dynamite Singletary's ""Super Good"" and the Soul Impossibles' ultra-gritty ""Interpretation: Soul Power No. 1"", both of which are essentially modifications of similarly named Brown tracks.

    The riches sitting in the bins of Carolina flea markets are apparently plentiful, and some of these songs are just dying to be heard by audiences far larger than their 250-count pressings allowed. Wally Coco's ""Message to Society"", the most disco-fied track on the disc, is a groove monster that pleasingly combines the slick rhythms taking over the dance floors of the late 70s with garage-rock caliber production. That's hardly the craziest groove here, though-that's probably the Soul Drifters' ""Funky Soul Brother"", which opens with a stinging wah guitar riff that, along with ridiculously tight drumming, co-anchors an amazing bass line, gang vocals, and horn lines that embody the adjective ""stabbing."" The horns on Paul Burton's ""So Very Hard to Make It"" are anything but stabbing, their rich orchestration providing a creamy backdrop for Burton's smooth soul croon.

    If you're a fan of old-school funk, picking this compilation up is a no-brainer. If you're an old-school funk dilettante, you could still do worse-- this isn't material with limited appeal, even if it had limited impact in its day. The lack of success most of these bands experienced had a lot more to do with simple geography and economics. The various Carolina funk scenes may have been poor for cash or resources, but they were rich with creativity.

The French band's     debut veers between delectably trashy drum-machine punk to Casio experiments     that reverberate in slow, strange ways, hinting at graphic drug use and casual     violence. The singer's voice is just slightly detached from the rest of     the music, hovering somewhere above the band and adding to the album's woozy,     unusual feel, whether barking, berating, or pleading. The songs are     claustrophobic and desperate, or they're silly and indulgent. But they're     nearly always concise, catchy, weird, and aloof.</p>
<p>""Jacob's Fight"" starts with a hint of faraway noise, before a     speeding, descending guitar crashes in over a 4/4 drum machine beat that sounds     like frozen meat being punched, while organs bleat out one wavering note underneath     it all. Even if it's just two notes, the organ takes more focus on     ""Clara Venus"" with an ominous fly-swatter hum that evokes B-movie     villainy, but the guitar thrash gets slowly more sophisticated as the vocals     get more gruff and animated. It has more swirling incidental     noise and effects that occasionally recalls the hazy, unpredictable punk of     early Butthole Surfers, though Cheveu's relative hold on traditional structures     and sanity makes them sound more accessible.     ""Happiness"" has the singer faithfully reading a grisly monologue from     the Todd Solondz film, and while you may not play it the whole way through more     than once, it reinforces the unpredictability and wry, indulgent humor of the     record. ""Dog"" shows off a different mode of the band, one that sounds     like a bizarre Lou Reed piss-take, from its more traditional blues-inspired     riffs and monotone eighth-note piano bashing to its hilariously confused     come-hither lyrics-- you could say something's lost in translation, but it's     pretty clear they're aiming for absurdity here. (""You smell like shit,     I'll take you to my mom's"").</p>
<p>The record gets a little more frazzled and hedonistic as it goes on. ""Herman     Choune"" begins with near-psychedelic organ tones, then retreats to the     band at its most lo-fi, with a caustic and oppressive dry sound that's nearly     oppressive, and makes its icy vintage keyboard tones sound as gritty and     primitive as any guitar. ""Great Competitor"" drowns the vocals in echo     to add chaos to its bluesier pogo-friendly stomp, the two-note tightrope riff     of ""Superhero"" plays like a more unhinged version Pixies'     ""Tony's Theme"" as the singer barks commands like a gas-huffing John     Moschitta. Then there's ""Lola Langusta"":     This re-recorded version adds a brief moment of ragtime squawk from a horn     section and a little bass to make the riff swing properly, and yet it has some     of the album's most tossed-off, silly lyrics, even more than ""Dog"".     It's self-defeating and swaggering at once; the band wants it both ways here,     and they get it.</p>
<p>They descend into less catchy and more chaotic material, as the drum     machine-driven ""Hot"" drags the band through ascending patterns in     narcotic indulgence. ""Hello Friends"" sounds genuinely threatening,     with it's minor-chord strum and obscured vocals evoking wires crossed and     connections frazzled, like scenes in movies where you're hearing a tragedy     through a walkie talkie. The record stalls occasionally, from the skippable     ""Happiness"" and the version of ""Unemployment Blues"" that     ambles aimlessly and maybe proves that it works best onstage, and the album     does lean heavily on material stretched across previous singles-- but it remains a     reward to anyone with the wherewithal to dig deeper.</p></div>"|11446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11446-cheveu/|7.6|Jason Crock

He released an introverted solo album in 2006, but for the most part, he's seemed like the perennial utility player looking for a way to present himself as a frontman. After a profile-boosting stint as Yeah Yeah Yeahs' touring guitarist for <i>Show Your Bones</i>, Wasif is taking another stab at putting his name on an album's cover instead of inside its credits. With bassist/keyboardist Bobb Bruno and drummer Adam Garcia, he's crafted a hybrid of glutinous stoner rock, darkly-hazed psychedelia, and slogging proto-metal, like Crazy Horse by way of Black Sabbath.</p>
<p>It's difficult to reconcile Wasif the songwriter with Wasif the Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist, as his playing style on <i>Strange Hexes</i> is deliberate and obtuse-angled, a sharp contrast to YYY's acute rave-ups. This implies that Wasif is a versatile guitarist, and certainly a talented one. Unfortunately, that versatility doesn't show through on this profoundly homogeneous album, and Wasif's talent is unduly circumscribed. Wasif and Two Part Beast know how to push a languid rock tune toward a chugging, barn-burning crescendo (""Wanderlust""), and they can seamlessly blend fuzzed-out arpeggios into tar-footed chords into gossamer webs of riffage (""Unveiling"" and ""The Oracle""). And they do, over and over. What they apparently can't or don't care to do is diversify, and despite its technical facility, <i>Strange Hexes </i>quickly becomes an exercise in tedium.</p>
<p>Wasif is a game singer, with a tuneful and somehow vague voice, but he doesn't marshal much force, preferring to drift inconspicuously amid the carefully interlaced  guitar phrases. The lyrics mostly stay out of the way, although occasionally, an eyebrow-raisingly ponderous phrase slips through (such as ""I am a chrysalis/ I am apocalypse,"" on the inevitable crunchy climax of ""Seventh Sign""). But for the most part, there's nothing dislikable about this album; it just seems uninspired: rock by rote. Its admirable qualities, such as Garcia's consistently muscular and fine percussion, don't cohere into songs that distinguish themselves from the relentless midtempo grind. Maybe a three or four part beast would've given it the extra heft it needs. As it stands, its slow-burns tend more toward wet-fuses, which will still spark if you wait around long enough. If you're willing to do so, you've far more patience (or weed) than I.</p></div>"|11482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11482-strange-hexes/|4.6|Brian Howe

    Considering the sort of cute overload your typical husband/wife music duo induces, Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel have done a commendable job establishing Mates of State as an original, inventive band rather than indie pop's equivalent of a lolcat. While their mid-concert kissy faces and ubiquitous canoodling press shots would seem to depict their music strictly as a product of love's labors, the duo's most intriguing draw stems from their ingenuity, consistently setting off creative lightbulbs album-after-album despite a limiting drums/keys palette. Of course, that's not to say the couple is impervious to the Sonny &amp; Cher effect. With two newly-minted babies in two years, Gardner and Hammel must feel a rite of passage into parenthood is due, as <em>Re-Arrange Us</em> thoroughly redecorates the standard Mates of State sound.</p><p>
    In <em>Re-Arrange Us</em>, these increasingly domesticated Mates have basically made an album to cook dinner and do the dishes to. Considering recent signs like their adorable naked PETA photo shoot, extensive blog chronicling of their daughters, and nascent experimentation with string arrangements on 2006's <em>Bring It Back,</em> the move to a gooey MOR aesthetic shouldn't be so surprising. The real shocker is how Gardner switches to piano after years on her trusty 1970s Electone organ, an instrument that served as her Excalibur, Mjolnir, and ""Wonder Boy"" bat all rolled into one. With his wife's sparkling arpeggios and carnival pump organ on the shelf, Hammel has no choice but to sound equally tame behind the skins, causing these songs to gently build rather than jerk the listener through one ADD idea after another.</p><p>
    The move is especially dangerous considering how the duo's runaway-mine-car frenzy was the principal repellent of emo accusations in the past. <em>Re-Arrange Us</em>, bogged down in fluffy multi-instrumental arrangements and overdubbed harmonies, can't help but slow things down and do some soul searching, sometimes to a stomach-wrenching degree. While most of the tracks here don't surpass <em>Bring It Back</em>'s lengthier durations, the added emotional and textural heft sure makes them <em>seem </em>longer. ""Now"", for example, softens the signature arpeggio from 2006 single ""For the Actor"" into the kind of celestial (for lack of better word) balladeering a band like Stars pulls off more effectively. Even the broken record chorus of repeated ""Now!""'s sounds oddly tranquil as both singers fly below their usual high-register yelp. Other potential dramatic peaks are similarly botched on ""Blue and Gold Print"" or ""You Are Free"", two rose-tinted lullabies hamstrung by sluggish melodies and too many held notes posing as hooks.
    </p>
<p>
    For those fearing the duo has jumped the shark here, history shows this could just be a brief stumble. <em>Our Constant Concern</em> from  2002 suffered from similar ailments as this album's (e.g., uninteresting harmonies, conservative songwriting, pedestrian tempos), and the band bounced back with 2003's <em>Team Boo</em>, their most white-knuckled album to date. Throwbacks like ""The Re-Arranger"" and ""Help Help"" prove the Mates still possess a mischievous pop streak, especially when belting scattershot melodies over each other. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of opportunities to get caught in that lovely crossfire on <em>Re-Arrange Us</em>, a record that, for all its lush bells and whistles, finds the pair sounding as bare-boned and sparse as you'd expect a two-person band to be.

    Upright bassist Nat Baldwin has his experimental bona fides in order. The first time I caught him live, he was playing a duet with Alex Mead on a DustBuster, and matched its on/off blasts with bowwork like a cat scratching through wicker. His bio also boasts the highlight of having studied with master composer and improviser Anthony Braxton, and if one of his homework assignments included a piece for four bassists playing in four separate galaxies-- well, I'm sure he aced it. Yet when Baldwin turned to writing and performing songs, first documented on his excellent, dire EP <em>Lights Out</em>, he held his improvisational chops in check to write solo, static pieces with keening vocals and dire words. His songbook has gotten catchier with time, and on his new release <em>Most Valuable Player</em>, he brings fierce performances to these polished compositions.</p><p>
    ""Lake Erie"" opens the record and introduces the three main voices: Baldwin's bass, played aggressively and seizing the lead; the 12-string electric guitar of Dirty Projectors' Dave Longstreth, which wriggles and squabbles throughout the record; and Baldwin's vocals. While his singing on <em>Lights Out </em>took a moaning, Andrew Bird-like timbre, he's pushed himself into a more vigorous and almost hiccuping style-- and while it's probably still a work in progress, his urgent cry fuels each song.</p><p>
    The double bass introduces most of the melodies, underpinning the more erratic addition of Longstreth's guitar. But aside from the two of them, Baldwin keeps the group lean: a bass clarinet accents the chorus on the lilting ""One Two Three"", and trumpet sputters along with the end of ""De-attached"" and gracefully accents his ballad ""Enter the Light Out"" (which you can also hear in an exquisitely tortured performance on his previous LP, <em>Enter the Winter</em>). Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear plays flute mellifluously on ""Black Square"", and while some moments are too luminescent-- the chorus on ""Mask I Wear"" suffers an almost treacly treatment-- most of the record is effects-free and raw. 
    </p>
<p>
    Baldwin has made his name as a bassist for Tigersaw and recently, the Dirty Projectors; <em>Most Valuable Player</em><em> </em>was recorded around the same time and in the same living room as the stupendous <em>Rise Above</em>. His musical imagination is expansive, while his lack of pretense is admirable. He doesn't even make you flinch when you read that ""Look She Said""'s lyrics come from the titles of Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff compositions; and in fact, the lyrics throughout the album are brief and strong. Reports from his latest tour say that the band takes wild free excursions off this material. But capturing his work on record, Baldwin hones his work to the starkest moments: an urge by the lake, a bloodstained footprint, a whistling bow in an empty room.

    By now, readers are familiar with Julian Cope's 1995 book <em>Krautrocksampler</em>, which helped rekindle appreciation of post-war German psychedelia. Thing is, most of us have never had a chance to read it, as it's looooooong out of print (Amazon's best price as of this writing is $213.10). This mirrors problems with the experimental artists Cope writes about, who often cut small-run releases for regional audiences. Listeners these days can now get re-issued Ash Ra Tempel, but many readers will have to be contented with Cope's recently-released companion piece <em>Japrocksampler</em>, which just so happens to feature a group of left-wing nuts named Les Rallizes Denudes.</p><p>
    Just as with their German contemporaries, LRD remains shrouded in mystery. Formed in 1967 at Kyoto University and playing shows up until 1996, the group mingled dirge-like rhythms with piercing guitar feedback, which is easy to tell from the live document <em>Eve Night</em>. They incorporated acid-washed takes on sunny San Francisco psych-rock and were always guided by avant-garde Japanese theatre. Their sound played a big part in fellow countrymen Acid Mothers Temple, as well as serving as a template for the likes of Flipper and the Melvins in the States. And Les Rallizes managed to do all this while hardly touching the studio.</p><p>
    Instead, their legend has grown on the back of monolithic performances, deafening volume, and jarring lightshows. Mythically militant, the group was known for distributing Marxist propaganda at junior high schools, and bassist Moriaki Wakabayashi was involved in the hijacking of an airliner by extremist group Sekigun. They were a group of towering guitar riffs, hard psych, inscrutable vocals, and radical ideals that simply blew away the audiences of the post-war Japanese underground. Those who know LRD today most likely heard them via one of their many live records like <em>Eve Night</em>, some legitimate and some bootlegged, and the group's releases remain sought-after collectors' items. 
    </p>
<p>
    But what's the big deal with these guys? Many of their available releases are the worst of bootleg tripe: badly recorded college campus shows taken from the deck of an amateur sound engineer. But <em>Eve Night</em> is of particular interest because it's cut of a different sort than those back-alley CD-Rs. The set, recorded at a Housei University show in 1983, is a good recording that catches the group on a damn good night. It's easier to hear the dynamic interplay between widely disparate vocals, rhythm, guitar, and bass than, say,<em> Eve Night</em>'s concurrently re-issued 1974 companion, <em>Are You Rallizesed?</em> The jams, which sometimes range over twenty minutes in length, tend to initially bear some resemblance to the 1960s California sound covered on the recent Rhino compilation <em>Love Is The Song We Sing: San Francisco Nuggets 1965-1970</em>, which features groups like Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Front Line, and the Dead. But the heavy machinations of Les Rallizes bear more in common with their hard-psych contemporaries Hawkwind. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Eve Night</em> is a wonderful document of the group not only because it's so clear, but because it catches the subtleties of their range, which is sometimes hard to hear in low-quality bootlegs. Singer Takashi Mizutani is never spectacular, and he often seems to be trying to be less than spectacular, but on cuts like their famous dirges ""Enter the Mirror"" and ""The Last One"", he affects the voice of a lonely, wandering spirit in the throes of an existential revelation. As counterpoint, LRD's superbly fuzzy guitar lead is the mark of a group that has transcended the blues, transcended drugs, and after sixteen years, remains in an impressionistic prime.
    </p>
<p>
    Ignuitas, the label that issued <em>Eve Night</em>, is similarly enigmatic. They don't have much in the way of PR, and their liner notes are frustratingly minimalist, but they've been releasing some great live LRD live shows for the last couple years. Perhaps the best thing about <em>Eve Night</em> is that it advances Stateside availability of LRD source material. Hopefully, it points towards the same kind of renaissance that made all those German stoners famous.

His bass teamed with ex-Liars drummer Ron Albertson, Noecker preserved Liars' rhythmic gusto with n0 Things, a band already DOA by the release of their intriguing debut. Making sure history doesn't repeat itself, Noecker's newest project These Are Powers follow up their late-2007 debut <em>Terrific Seasons</em> with an EP that should guarantee these self-described ""ghost-punks"" don't fade away quite so quickly.</p><p>
    Laugh at the spectral label all you want, but Noecker's post-Liars projects, and TAP in particular, have established an MO of making very blunt, visceral rock/punk tropes feel like a vague out-of-body experience. Like the finest no wave and post-punk acts it so blatantly mined from, <em>Terrific Seasons</em> transmogrified stomping blues beats and tribal war dances into something that makes you wake up in a cold sweat instead of moving your feet. However, somewhere between that record and <em>Taro Tarot,</em> TAP's decided there's more in life than gross-out noise collages and unfeeling graveyard jams. While still a little too ungodly to capture our hearts, this EP contains ""ghost-punks"" of the <em>Ghostbusters </em>variety-- spooky at first but not without a mischievous charm.</p><p>
    For all its moaning guitar parts and haunted house reverb, opener ""All Night Services"" sings the blues at its most traditional, replete with mentions of Mississippi and pulsating, if not sexy, drums. While hardly fit for a juke joint, the track recalls n0 Things's tendency to take standard song conventions and rip out their innards. ""Chipping Ice"" easily stands as TAP's most accessible song yet, downplaying the jungle drum arrangements in favor of a rapid-fire bass/snare/cymbal onslaught. Coupled with a shuffling bassline, Noecker's sassy shrieks suffer a similar fate as John Lydon's sepulchral take on disco, too catchy for nihilistic no wave, too grotesque to pass for a plausible dancefloor number.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, after the stately harmonics fanfare of the Killing Joke-inspired ""Cockles"", the EP backslides into a more homogeneous gruel. Of course, for a seasoned noise fanatic this gruel goes down easy, but there's little distinguishing it from an Excepter or Black Dice B-side. As a trial balloon, though, <em>Taro Tarot</em> unequivocally succeeds. Merely a few months after their debut LP, TAP are sporting new tricks and establishing themselves as potential movers and shakers in their field rather than another footnote on Noecker's resume.</p></div>"|11468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11468-taro-tarot-ep/|6.8|Adam Moerder

    about  displacement and loneliness, but it
    renders its subjects and speakers so anonymous that they fail to tap
    into this vein of common urban experience. Instead its vague gestures

    welcome, saxophone, organ and banjo can't entirely make up for the lack
    of imagination the band employs in their structures and lyrics.</p><p id=""dab5"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Like many just-all right albums, <span id=""mih80"">it</span> offers its best track, ""I Can't Be What U
    Want"", early on. Singer Brian Harding affably breezes through
    nursery-school grade rhymes over the song's New Orleans horn stabs and
    banjo. That same breeziness coats the whole record, even as the subject
    turns to cross-country ennui. Hymns keep a light touch: New York is
    scary, happy and/or pretty; in L.A. you've got ""nothing to lose."" ""I
    told you what you wanted to hear,"" Harding sings on ""Streets Alone"",
    and here it's smooth sax, benign and easy as the rest of the album's songs.
    Hymns hit something of a stride in the second half. Though the line
    still end in monosyllabic pap, ""Train Song"" soothes any anxieties
    there; you can't feel malicious toward something as pliable and watery
    as its pedal steel. The title track's title line-- ""We travel in herds/ We mix up our words""-- doesn't reveal anything about Hymns' intentions, but the piano march is a nice change from the acoustic
    alt-country goo.
    <br/>
    Also like many just-all right albums, <em>Travel in Herds</em> ends with an unnecessarily
    long track, ""On the Run"". It's also the first time we get to hear where
    Hymns wanted to go. Harding raises his voice here, in something
    approaching anger; organs chime in behind, crescendos crescendo, then a
    saxophone surfs over it all, a <em>smooth</em> sax. While it's not exactly
    exhilarating, ""On the Run"" could serve as compass leading the band a
    little further from the comfort of home. It may not be the big city,
    but at least it's not the middle of the road.</p></div>"|11459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11459-travel-in-herds/|5.2|Jessica Suarez

Their      new album highlights what's always been catchiest about Subtle's music:      it's full of short, fast bangers that you can enjoy out of the corner      of your ear. But scratch the surface, and you find something far gnarlier--      the most intricate realization yet of the vision of frontman Doseone,      a.k.a. rapper, poet and visual artist Adam Drucker.</p>
<p><i>ExitingARM </i> is the latest chapter in the story of Hour Hero Yes, the middle-class      rapper whose rise and struggles are chronicled told on 2004's <i>A New      White</i> and 2006's <i>For Hero: For Fool</i>. It's hard to talk about      ""what happens"" in a story that fluidly moves between fiction,      memoir, and surrealism, but nevertheless: at the end of <i>For Hero:      For Fool, </i>Hour Hero Yes drops through a door and into a world that's      a twisted version of our own. As soon as he lands, he's captured by      the Ungodz, Revered Pitman and Dr. MoonorGun. They lock him in their      keep and force him to crank out perfect pop songs, while he sneaks out      subversive messages that tell the truth about what's going on.</p>
<p>But these records also tell      the story of Subtle, and their quest to break out of the alt-hip-hop/<i>Wire </i> feature niche where they've all lived for so long. Leaving behind their      first bedroom-project EPs and the lo-fi <i>A New White</i>, they've      become aggressive and astonishing-- and still bleeding edge. Too textural      for top 40, with beats too hard for the experimental bin, the new album draws on      the same palette as before: they're still a sextet with drums and      drum machines, synths and laptops, Dax Pierson (still contributing,      via Ableton Live, after the van accident that rendered him quadriplegic),      guitar and woodwinds where they need them, a full-time cellist, and      Doseone's vocals-- which are gruff, high, gibbering, bragging, and blissful.      From the kraut-rock throb of ""Day Dangerous"" to the closing      drift of ""Providence"", the arrangements take fewer left turns and ace hooks-- an aching falsetto harmony,      a riff on an analog keyboard-- sweeten every song.</p>
<p>Yet Doseone didn't skip the      hard parts: instead, he split the project across two media-- the record,      and a <a href=""http://www.exitingarm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Flash      website</span></b></a> loaded      with drawings, simple animations, and hidden poems, that'll run up to      20,000 words and spell out the mythology in unprecedented depth. The      website and the records expand on one another. To take one example,      flip to chapter one of the almanac (""Ungodz Splay"") and click      around until you find ""Trouble in Anchorage""; then listen      to <i>ExitingARM's </i>""The Crow,"" this time knowing where      the bird came from.</p>
<p>If this all sounds heavy, it's      because you're not listening to Doseone deliver it. He speaks and raps      in a highly-refined style that I'll refer to as a cant. It's built on      free associations and quick, complex metaphors delivered at disturbing      speed, and disjointed with contradictions and negatives, with lots of      ""not""-this, or ""un""-that. Read the lyric sheet cold,      and it's impenetrably abstract-- yet the sound of the language is pleasing      for its own sake, which puts him right on the shelf between <i>Ulysses </i> and Dr. Seuss.</p>
<p>The album boasts the most opaque      lyrics in Subtle's catalog. But put the record and the website together,      and the big themes become clear. Hour Hero Yes is a middle-class hero      who fights apathy and consumerism. Critiques of America come in forms      both obvious (""red white and blind"") and cryptic (the fork      is ""the spirit animal of the American consumer,"" as he told      blogger Mr. Mammoth). The Headache Twins, who are the heads of music      television and rulers of ""the commodified world,"" are obviously      the bad guys, and Hour Hero Yes wants to reverse the apathy that drags      us toward ""the terrible great nothing much."" Everyone still      alive is called a ""goner,"" and as Dose puts it, twice: ""Q:      what's working man's hope? A: they call it cope.""</p>
<p>But consider Hour Hero Yes'--      and really, Doseone's-- stake in this struggle. Hour Hero Yes has been      forced to write hit pop songs, but his songs do not include the word      ""I."" They're anonymous, and Hour Hero Yes can only communicate      through hidden messages in the lyrics, which means he keeps himself      a secret in his own work: they are pop songs that come without a pop      star. Which is exactly what Doseone has done on <i>ExitingARM. </i> The man behind these lyrics has paid his dues and wants the rewards.       As he told <i>Pitchfork </i>last fall, ""the knife is in our teeth.""      But if Dose is really after fame, he's chosen an elusive path to the      top.</p>
<p>Doseone has spent his career      documenting the inner monologues, hidden secrets, and unnamable anxieties      that we all feel, but don't put in words. We murmur this stuff in our      heads on the train home, in our bedrooms where we hide in books and      pick at our bodies. We all have our own cant, yet we never let ourselves      use it. Instead, we settle for a common language-- and as Dose argues,      that language gets simpler and cruder all the time. You can complain      that Americans talk in pop culture references, but when's the last time      you tried to express anything more private? Dose wrote a lyric about      the moles on his penis; have you?</p>
<p>Doseone is a confessional artist      by nature. But where most indie confessors sell themselves as ""just      like us,"" Doseone never will-- which is why his ""poppiest""      disc to date is also his toughest.  While he gladly lets us into      his head, he's not here to commiserate, so much as lead. He's not your      new pop hero: rather, he's cast himself as an avatar, the patron saint      of diary-scribblers, and penis-mole-pickers, and world-crushed workers.      And the knife is in his teeth.</p></div>"|11510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11510-exitingarm/|8.3|Chris Dahlen

    The box office numbers don't justify the possibility of a <em>Walk Hard </em>sequel, but if a British version were to be made, you could find worse inspirations than the Charlatans UK. Yeah, their timeline doesn't have any sort of linear sense to it, but their phases are plenty distinct: Madchester, Britpop, Dylan, Stones and even a bizarre Club Med reggae interlude (2006's <em>Simpatico</em>). For a change of pace, <em>You Cross My Path </em>doesn't actually  align itself with any sort of trend other than free availability on the internet, and to hear the band tell it, that was the most likely result for this project all along. It's pretty representative of the dichotomy existent within <em>You Cross My Path</em>: as possibly their strongest work since <em>Tellin' Stories</em>, it's something that the Charlatans UK can expect to favorably speak for itself, but it will likely hold ""members only"" interest for the brave souls who've followed their every move this whole time-- the type that use terms like ""their strongest work since <em>Tellin' Stories</em>.""</p><p>
    It's a problem that's sorta out of their control; had this been released in 2000 by newcomers, it likely could have fallen into the hands of Brit enthusiasts that were fucking with the likes of South and Elbow back when ""the next Coldplay"" didn't quite have as many pejorative connotations. Think of it as a <em>Greatest Hits</em> collection that doesn't contain actual hits, or at the very least, a fake retrospection that has all of their trajectories meeting up at the same intersection.  And while it might result in one of the more seamless works of recent Charlatanism, ""seamless"" could also pass for ""meh.""  The building blocks are still readily identifiable-- Tim Burgess' nasal bray can still inject a good degree of sneer into lines like ""you're no friend of mine"" and otherwise sell the overly wordy and schlocky rhine-Stones hook of the title track. And if you can prominently feature Hammonds without sounding like Rami Jaffee is on your payroll, more power to you. Thing is, when you combine everything these guys have done into one ten-track platter, you get an unfavorable situation where survivors decades deep in the game sound like they're trying to play catch-up with the last two Stills albums.</p><p>
    The band's always had a tangential relationship with dance music, so it's strange to hear them so out of step. Take ""Missing Beats (Of A Generation)""-- while hurtling forward with the record's greatest sense of purpose, the parenthetical likely refers to a time around 1998, which is approximately the year Kula Shaker might have been looking to latch on their B-3 trillings to a safe jungle beat. Not insular enough for ya? I'm fairly certain ""My Name Is Despair"" is a reference to a Rob Dickinson solo track, and I'm fairly certain that its hacked, syncopated drum pattern and phone-booth vocals were swimming around in DJ Shadow's inbox during the <em>Psyence Fiction </em>sessions. ""The Misbegotten"" cribs ""Blue Monday"" a bit more tastefully than Orgy did, but as far as ""Bird/Reprise"" goes, get Peter Hook drunk and he'll swear he played bass on it. 
    </p>
<p>
    Problem is, for many people this will feel like a career summation in that it's all very competent, but lacking a certain personality, something that would cause other bands to be compared to the Charlatans UK as opposed to the other way around; a record that's most likely to be definitive. So really, it's difficult to determine whether <em>You Cross My Path </em>is a victim of the times or its own merits; it's the sort of thing that's so competent that it's more likely to be defined by its failures than its success. Unlike a similarly shapeshifting outfit like Primal Scream, Charlatans UK never flew high enough to be legendary or fell off to a point where a comeback would be interesting, and maybe they're sensing that they can only play the survivor card for so long. The album closes with, you guessed it, ""This Is the End"", which sounds like defiance (""I will never be put down/ I will only be set free""), but is unclear in intent. Burgess claims ""it's the end of you and me,"" but it can easily be mistaken for a state of the Charlatans address.

This is Pattern Is Movement's Andrew Thiboldeaux, on ""Sound of Your Voice"", singing to someone never clearly identified. Is it a lover? An enemy? A friend? It doesn't matter who the object of his sonic affection is in the context of the song, because the line functions more as a manifesto for Thiboldeaux's band, which was once a quintet but is now down to a duo of him and drummer Chris Ward. By the warped internal logic that guides PIM's music, ""I just like the sound of your voice"" could be a reason to love someone until death.</p><p>
    Pattern Is Movement is all about sound, or rather sounds, plural. Their music is best described as modular, building complete songs from sub-units of melody and beat. The result is out there, but it doesn't seem pretentious because of the giddy single-mindedness with which the band attacks the concept-- it's the sound of the voice he likes and not the person speaking-- the voice isn't used to tell a story. It's used as an instrument, the same way everything else is in their music-- which these days consists mostly of drums and a big pile of vintage keyboards-- is used.</p><p>
    The album opens with a sudden burst of strangely contoured melody; Ward brings in a sharp rock beat shortly after the opening fanfare, re-contextualizing the melody rhythmically, as Thiboldeaux surrounds his own voice with a keyboard-generated choir. The song builds and builds to an abrupt ending. Ward alternately uses his drums to pull all the disparate phrases together in a steady rhythm and as yet another phrase to fit into the overall interlocking pattern. On ""Trolley Friend"", he does both, creating a simple beat to shepherd the bubbling keyboard phrases and lava flow bass into a neat rhythm track and then delivering a thunderous tom roll to back the chorus, if the stuttering, off-kilter section of the song that follows the beat-driven section can be described as such. If nothing else, swings such as these demonstrate how well the band has honed its sense of drama. ""Sylvia"" offers further testament, delivering arcing vocal phrases over a steady beat and constantly shifting keyboard textures that continually cast the vocals in a new light.
    </p><p>
    It takes special musicians to make a sound like this work, but three LPs into their career, Thiboldeaux and Ward seem to have it figured out, creating an accessible album that nonetheless sounds unlike anything any other band is doing. Scott Solter, co-producing the band for the second time, has the sound figured out as well, lending the album a clear, direct character that emphasizes the contrasts between density and sparseness at the heart of PIM's work.

Cloudland Canyon's second LP, <i>Lie in Light, </i>opens with a song called ""Krautwerk"", conflating a band and a genre so closely related that the pun verges on tautology. But Kraftwerk were futurists. Cloudland Canyon are more atavistically inclined, more Can than Kraftwerk. They want order <i>within</i> chaos, not instead of it, and on ""Krautwerk"", they mask their Krautrock homage in the Velvet Underground's patented blend of rock guitars and primordial ooze.</p>
<p>""Krautwerk"" takes its time making its point: A long celestial blackout courts transcendental bliss, before the shaggy techno-organic rhythm, noodly guitars, and submerged incantations give shape to the void. At seven minutes, it also wears out its welcome before it departs, as it's hard to get into the song's liminal groove (which all of Cloudland Canyon's music strives to find) when the title's already told you exactly where it's going. Happily, Cloudland Canyon's Kip Uhlhorn (Panthers, Red Scare) and Simon Wojan (King Khan &amp; the Shrines) veer away from the cumbersome Krautrock template for most of<i> Lie in Light</i>. But the sense that they're trying to lasso lightning persists, and unifies the otherwise-eclectic album. In naming themselves after a state park in Georgia, the band seems less interested in naturalistic allegory than the resonance of the words themselves: The image of a canyon filled with clouds is terrific shorthand for the vastness of their sound. On ""White Woman"", droning walls of shoegaze guitar feel at once impregnable and vaporous, like you could put your hand right through them. As noise-pop jams go, it's powerful; but like ""Krautwerk"", it feels a bit telegraphed, its intensity levels rising and falling exactly where you'd expect.</p>
<p>Bludgeoning stasis seems close to Cloudland Canyon's collective heart, yet when they loosen up and let their music move a little, they excel. <i>Lie in Light </i>really hits its stride with the third track, the spongy electro jam ""You &amp; I"", which lets go of daunting stasis and finds the band tapping into a deep corporeal groove: I like hearing that spirit, the prioritization of the moment over posterity, that spontaneity and wantonness-- the record could use more of both. ""You &amp; I"" is <i>Lie in Light</i>'s unquestionable apex, and it's perfectly sequenced in the middle of the album: after an upward climb and a thrumming climax, we begin the downward slide into less blatantly ecstatic tracks. If you took three or four Angelo Badalamenti scores and layered them all on top of each other, you might wind up with something very similar to ""Scheisse Schatzi, Auf Wiedersehen!"", a sonic analog to a dissociative fugue. An idyllic krautrock passage flares up like a muscle memory amid the cosmic gusts of ""Heme"", and the impenetrable title track, all drones and concussions, slams down with apocalyptic finality: no discernible guitars, no isolated rhythms, no verbal semiotics, just a long, loud, obliterative ending.</p></div>"|11457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11457-lie-in-light/|6.4|Brian Howe

At the county's southernmost point, it's still 225 miles from San Francisco, and much of the area could safely be called rural-- not much to speak of but a couple of colleges, strong weed, and a bunch of giant redwoods. The band's heaviness is just as elemental and matter-of-fact as their forest surroundings, but their sound is a little more nervous, and nods further south: to San Diego, home of Drive Like Jehu, who are clearly a compass point for this young band. They don't share the complex riffs and odd time signatures of DLJ, but they have the tone down, and are heavy without resorting to any raucous distortion, double bass-drum attacks, or quiet-to-loud; theirs is a much more subtle style of bludgeoning.  More than that, without the use of laid-back surfer signifiers or sweetened Beach Boy-styled harmonies, they still manage to represent their zip code.</p><p>
    If only the whole of <em>Deep in the Woods</em> lived up to the promise of its first track. ""Queen of the Nile"" has an ominous drum patter that unwinds as slow as its circular guitar riff and creeping bass line, while singer Pablo Midence and some barely audible piano chords are drops in a bottomless bucket of open space.  The guitars up the attack and the drums hit harder, but there's no explosion, just a swell in volume that recedes as quickly and unceremoniously as it started. ""Mas Por Dinero"" is earthy and oppressive like the best stoner-rock, but nervier and more prone to full band stop-starts, and with a mix of Spanish and English in the Midence's barked lyrics.</p><p>
    ""One Way Ticket to Rome"" has a similar kind of tension between its elastic riff and the jerks and heaves of the rhythm section, but as the record progresses, the sharp dynamics alone can't overcome the uniform sound of the record as a whole. ""The Need to Fight"" sustains tension with build-ups and fake-outs, but tracks like ""Snailshine"" or ""Depth Charge"" don't have much resonance beyond the initial stun of their tricky rhythm (not to mention limber drumming throughout). ""1,000,000"" sneaks in a memorable hook near the record's end, and if they could take advantage of open space as they did at the album's start, and were Midence to grow as a guitarist and incorporate more melody, the band could easily grow beyond their influences and their surroundings. As is, <em>Deep in the Woods</em> has an enticing sound with a few great tracks.</p></div>"|11355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11355-deep-in-the-woods/|6.3|Jason Crock

    The thin line between schmaltz and beauty is something musicians have had to grapple with for a while, especially during a generation of pop where recontextualization is something we tend to take for granted. Right now I'm listening to ""Victoria's Secret,"" the first track from Quiet Village's <em>Silent Movie</em>, and I'm imagining other people in a similar situation squinching up their faces at how cheesily doe-eyed it must sound to them: beachside surf sounds and seagull keening, weepy strings, a sedate, molasses-flow rhythm section that consists of an almost inaudible feather-tapped drum and a snore-pace bass. It sounds like some long-forgotten slab of incidental music from a pay-for-use soundtrack library, composed in the hopes that some TV movie pulls it from the stacks to score a chaste falling-in-love scene.</p><p>
    Except that most of this song's structure actually comes from a hauntingly lovelorn and classic Chi-Lites ballad, 1972's ""The Coldest Days of My Life""-- and once you know that, it gets harder to hear ""Victoria's Secret"" as strictly cheese, especially once you recognize Eugene Record's voice echoing through the tides. <em>Silent Movie</em> has a field day with this tweaking of the margins between extravagant easy listening and the more ""proper"" strains of pop and r&amp;b, the result being a record that betrays the frequently subjective notion of what ""kitsch"" consists of. Quiet Village is a project of Matt Edwards, best known as tech-house auteur Radio Slave, and collaborator Joel Martin, whose pre-Quiet Village activity consists most significantly of his hand in compiling <em>Bite Hard</em>, a cult-classic compilation of 1970s library music from Britain's De Wolfe Studio. What they've come up with has frequently been lumped in with the Balearic revival movement, which relies in part on a sort of sun-baked, slow-moving codeine-disco vibe that (despite my best efforts) largely defies easy classification.</p><p>
    Most of the prime examples of this are found in the tracks that originated as 12"" single sides back in 2005 and 2006, which also comprise most of <em>Silent Movie</em>'s rhythmic pulse. The leisurely, palm-lined slow cruise of ""Pillow Talk"" lifts from select bits of the 1978 Alan Parsons Project album <em>Pyramid</em> and then blows out its guitar-driven downtempo AOR slickness into an even heavier, thicker sheen of ambient coke-prog. It leads cleanly into the single it was originally the 2005 B-side to, the coming-down funk of ""Can't Be Beat"", and by slowing Trade Mark's Franco-disco ""Days of Pearly Spencer"" (also from 1978) to a woozy crawl they create a particularly tense and bleary brand of late-nite post-club slow jam, an atmosphere shared by the electric piano-driven, Captain and Tenille-monologue-appropriating dope haze of second single ""Too High to Move"". The notable exception to all this blissful dancefloor torpor is a bit of bikers-versus-zombies drive-in-movie fare called ""Circus of Horror"", the most uncharacteristic (and maybe the best) song on the record: in the simplest terms, it's blatant Tarantino bait that sounds like Hendrix's Band of Gypsys after developing some kind of Italian soundtrack fetish, and it's the one moment on the record where the drums not only really come alive but threaten to tumble down directly on top of you.
    </p>
<p>
    The funny (and problematic) thing is, a lot of these songs, especially the newer tracks, aren't that heavily altered in comparison to its subjectively tacky source material. ""Utopia"" is essentially Andreas Vollenweider's ""Steam Forest"" with some bits switched here and there to disguise its new age origins; the tribal spaghetti Western rumble of ""Gold Rush"" draws liberally from late-60s psych band Writing on the Wall's ""Buffalo""; ""Pacific Rhythm"" basically <em>is</em> Ryuichi Sakamoto's version of Sister Sledge's Chic-gone-reggae deep cut ""You're A Friend to Me"". Think of <em>Silent Movie</em> more as an edits and remixes record-- or even a reproduced DJ set-- than a sample pastiche, and maybe it'll feel less larcenous, though I can't imagine that the people left disillusioned by the revelation that Daft Punk didn't write the riff to ""Digital Love"" will be all that thrilled. Maybe there's a different divide to worry about here: it's not a matter of whether the music is cheesy, but whether the appropriation is. Strange how an album that invites scenesters to overcome their aversion to AOR slickness trips them up by playing against moral codes concerning authenticity and proper credit. At worst, this just makes <em>Silent Movie</em> a kind of stealth mix CD (see also Rub-n-Tug's 2006 Balearic progenitor
    mix <em>Better With a Spoonful of Leather</em>). At best, they've just compiled the soundtrack to the finest 3 a.m. trip home you'll have all year.

    Exceptions certainly abound, but the much-celebrated musical mess coming from Baltimore for the last several years seems to have been successful in part because it augmented outsider sounds with the tension of playfulness: Dan Deacon's kaleidoscopic electronic music sounds like the sweat of a man who has chased too much tie-dye must taste, and the sometimes maudlin, sometimes awesome a cappella send-ups of Lexie Mountain Boys incorporate grunts, wails, and claps into songs about chicken and cheese. Perhaps you remember Baltimore ex-pats Animal Collective singing sweetly against college for 53 seconds on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Sung Tongs</span>? Or, more recently, how fellow Interstate 95 North travelers Yeasayer named their debut <em>All Hour Cymbals</em> and-- apocalypse-obsessed or no-- managed to squeeze some humor into such questionable times. Video Hippos? Ponytail? Santa Dads? All funny names for interesting music.</p><p>
    While jokes are one thing, jocular mischief embedded within provocative, exploratory, erudite music is another: Deacon has dual degrees in electro-acoustic and computer music from New York's Purchase College, and he admits that he wants his tunes to work both at parties and on headphones. I watched Boys ringleader Lexie Mountain run with some of the top names in noise at a festival last year, and I think Ponytail's forthcoming debut, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ice Cream Spiritual</span>, is one of the more agile and enterprising instrumental rock records of the year. It just happens to be lined with playful vocal outbursts and antiphonies.</p><p>
    Enter Ecstatic Sunshine, a Baltimore band that was, until sometime last year, the guitar duo of Dustin Wong and Matt Papich. The two met in a Baltimore arts school in 2004, and, by 2006, they'd released two albums of well-rehearsed, tightly executed mini-suites for guitar. The counterpoints were colorful and quick, and both the pace and crunchy, thin guitar tones spoke more to house parties than conservatories. But while the music glowed and winked like the band's name, the pair's instrumentals were complex and precise. They weren't getting by on mere concept.
    </p>
<p>
    Wong left Ecstatic Sunshine last year to focus full-time on Ponytail, but, before his departure, he and Papich invited another art school friend, Kieran Gillen, to join on electronics, mixing and sampling both guitar lines in real-time. This incarnation of Ecstatic Sunshine recorded <em>Way</em>, the band's third LP and first for Cardboard Records. Where the guitarmonies and action arches of 2004's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">New Kind of Imagination</span> and 2006's<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> Freckle Wars</span> were playful to the fault of a shtick, <em>Way</em> pulls back to the other side. Here, ornamental guitar lines converge and crackle into coruscated power drones or beam by like rainbows in curved air. Some would say it's ""serious"" music.
    </p>
<p>
    Some moments shimmer: Opener ""B"" immediately sounds like the old Ecstatic Sunshine, rigorous guitar lines pinging off of one another in a bright sonic space. But the familiar sound gets jostled in the speakers, alternately amplified and undercut by Gillen's electronics and guitar playing that's not trying to impress would-be guitar heroes now. The sounds stretch, clip, reverse, circuit: Imagine <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Music for Airports</span> on amphetamines (that is, still sort of slow) or the Field with cough syrup instead of drum machines.
    </p>
<p>
    Other moments abrade, albeit lightly: ""B"" empties gently into ""Herrons"", which floats thin, pretty guitar tones into small little circles. A grey band of noise leaks across the channels, overtaking the track just before the 30-second mark. Skip to a random point along the rest of the seven-minute track, and the sound may jar you. But start again, and notice Ecstatic Sunshine's accomplishment. By slowly mixing in the noise and always keeping those astral whirs within earshot, they make the slow ascent into abrasion welcoming and, in a way, gentle. Fully committed to that idea, it's a perfect track.
    </p>
<p>
    Previous fans will no doubt lament the loss of the quirkier, two-piece Ecstatic Sunshine, especially because an LP that sounds exactly as transitional as it is serves as the duo's obituary. Papich has indicated that the band is headed even further out, and he's added another electronicist, David Zimmerman. When I saw the trio play in March, they were heavier and more risky than I'd ever heard them. Indeed, more exciting than a band capable of churning out endless cheeseball anthems for two electric guitars is the band capable of doing such and running in the opposite direction. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Way</span> is a humble first step in what sounds like a glorious new trip, where the really well played guitar becomes something else entirely. Fear not: Especially on closer ""Perrier"", which moves from subliminal washes of sound to a full-on, distortion-up, rock-out coda in 10 minutes, that suggest endless possibilities, Ecstatic Sunshine still cherish the transcendent and the playful. After all, how can a band with a name like that ever be completely serious?

Don't let the signifiers fool you: Though based on beautiful acoustic guitar music, very little about <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Faint at the Loudest Hour</span> is pure, conservative, or provincial. Instead, by embedding both new age and noise-oriented electronic themes into his pastoral pieces, Turnquist unites disparate traditions and ideals, essentially employing sonic counterweights to construct 57 minutes that are as surprisingly dynamic as they are perfectly beautiful.</p><p>
    The cover of <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Faint at the Loudest Hour</span> is a detail from a shot included in Turnquist's photography series, <em>Broken Reflections</em>. Using a jagged handheld mirror, Turnquist simultaneously captures the scene in front of the lens and something just behind it. In this shot, a visage of knotty, bare branches and blue sky is interrupted by a mirror reflecting more of the same-branches, a sky that's several shades darker, and white splotches (snow?) that disrupt the disruptive image. As the process-based cover and the paradoxical title suggest, <em>Faint</em> explores and interconnects disparate motifs and methods, essentially taking one ""picture"" and making it more provocative through juxtaposition and mixing. The dominant guitar style here, for instance, employees long, uninterrupted billows of notes in conflicting high and low registers, much like James Blackshaw's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Cloud of Unknowing</span>. But Turnquist occasionally plays in a more percussive style suggestive of Leo Kottke, Michael Hedges, or the contemporary Kaki King. At its best, the guitar work meets those methods in the middle, when Turnquist is executing beyond a singular stylistic comfort.</p><p>
    Similarly, Turnquist undermines some of the disc's most pristine acoustic moments with drones and howls and floods of electronic sound. Assisted by producer and tape wizard Scott Solter, these non-traditional textures are the real counter-reflective glory on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Faint at the Loudest Hour</span>. Opener ""Amongst a Swarm of Hummingbirds"" unfurls a dexterous 12-string guitar stream, Turnquist shaping minor-chord explorations into an arching anthem. Suddenly, the theme is gone, sucked into a blissful vortex of coruscated tape swells, the resplendence tempered with noisy clicks and muted roars beneath. When the guitar re-emerges, it aggresses, less patient and romantic with the pattern now. By track's end, both a bowed lap steel and a trance-like beat have clawed at the acoustic theme.
    </p><p>
    Aside from the sheer beauty and power of Turnquist's compositions, his biggest accomplishment may be the use of one conflicting form to accent previously overlooked aspects of another. The three-minute wash of tidal electronics that opens ""Water Spots Upon My Mind"", for example, professes the talents of Turnquist and producer Solter. More importantly, though, it reveals the slow waves of melody written into Turnquist's long-form songs by massaging the attack of the guitar's notes into smooth hills and valleys. That is, by stripping all of the notes away, Turnquist let's us see the forest without having to identify the trees. For such an accomplished player, the move is almost altruistic. Likewise, an electronic haze dotted by vibraphone and taps against the hollow body of a guitar opens ""In the Vein of Bedlam"". The eerie improvisation hovers, torpid, setting the mood for the brusque picking that overtakes it. Turnquist sounds indignant and troubled, but the key of his anger matches that of the piece's intro. The first four minutes, then, were the sound of his ire taking shape. Because of that prelude, what would have sounded only like an intricate, ominous moment of 12-string guitar sounds more like a story. Connecting is easier.
    </p>
<p>
    Inevitably, Turnquist's multi-instrumental ambition sometimes gets the best of him. He emphasizes themes to the point of redundancy or didactism at points, like the return to electronics on the otherwise brilliant ""Water Spots Upon My Mind"". But, much like Mike Tamburo's 2006 The <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ghosts of Marumbey</span> and Fennesz's 2001 <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Endless Summer</span>, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Faint at the Loudest Hour </span>proclaims that the intersection of guitar heroics and electronics craftsmanship is vital.

    ""I am on strike,"" Craig Extine announces late in ""Volatile"",
    from the Old Haunts' third full-length, <em>Poisonous
    Times</em>. It's a curious declaration, especially on the opening track,
    suggesting that there won't be an album to follow. However, for the Old Haunts,
    music is a form of picketing, not something to picket against. They're on a
    small label that's local to them; they tour determinedly but play independent
    venues; they have very few, if any, corporate connections. On their
    first two releases, the EP collection <em>Fallow
    Field</em> and the follow-up <em>Fuel on Fire</em>,
    they expressed a general unease with the world, alternately outraged and
    disgusted not only with the course of society, but-- more interestingly-- by
    their own inability to halt or redirect it, or even simply to remove themselves
    from it. That frustration sparked their minimal No Logo indie punk. <em>Poisonous Times</em> further refines and
    reshapes it.</p><p>
    Of course, there's a new drummer on <em>Poisonous Times</em>. Each release has introduced a new one to the band: This time it's Tobi Vail, formerly of Bikini Kill, who
    let's hope stays on for a few albums. She's perhaps the best yet, allowing the
    Old Haunts to tighten up their already compressed sound and to move in some new
    directions. After Extine lays down the album's best curlicue riff at the
    beginning of stand-out ""Hurricane Eyes"", she enters at almost double-time,
    completely opening up the song's possibilities. Her galloping rhythms push
    ""Outside of Divided Time"" at a pent-up midtempo. Extine seems to be stretching
    as well: ""Hang Up on the Downside"" is a rare acoustic number, although Scott
    Seckington's lurching bass preempts any ballad pretensions.</p><p>
    Their most diverse release yet, <em>Poisonous Times</em> finds new directions to deploy the Old Haunts' brutally
    spare attack, highlighting their swampy existentialism on ""Ruined View"", their
    mellower side on ""Sunshine"", and the spacey guitars on ""Sister
    City"". There's a tension in these
    songs that strenuously conveys the paranoia and agitation in Extine's lyrics,
    yet over the course of the album, that dynamic occasionally flags as too many
    of these songs run on long after they've presented and re-presented their
    ideas. There's a great two-and-a-half-minute single in ""Volatile"", which
    unfortunately clocks in at four and a half minutes. And no way should ""In
    Revolt"" or ""Knives on the Mind"" or really any song on <em>Poisonous Times</em> exceed three and a half minutes tops. As the band
    grows increasingly adventurous, Extine is writing punchier hooks on ""Ruined
    View"" and ""Hurricane Eyes"", but they get lost in the sprawl of these
    arrangements, which give this album a slightly undisciplined feel that ultimately
    dilutes the impact of the band's protest.

About all that's missing is the authoritarian businessman. Instead, label founders Leon ""El"" Michels and Jeff Silverman are musicians and enthusiasts for the days when Revilot, Atco, Brunswick, Motown, Vee-Jay, Stax, and others filled the bins with 45s. They even seem enthusiastic about the 45 format itself, having steadily released a small flood of them over the past four years. If you missed out on those-- most were issued in small batches-- or simply don't own a record player, here's your chance to get caught up: This is the second volume compiling their 45s, this one covering everything from 2006 forward (they haven't made a big deal out of it, but vinyl lovers who buy the double LP are treated to quite a few bonus tracks, a nice nod and wink to their main constituency).</p><p>
    The singles are presented chronologically, which works fine. The Bronx River Parkway single that starts things off is a strong opener. This venerable Latin soul band goes back for decades, and their two 45s are highlights of the compilation. ""La Valla"" is a perfect exercise in sharp 1970s-style funk, with staccato verses full of economical horn, bass, and guitar parts and legato choruses that let the horns stretch out more melodically. The bare-bones production suits it well.</p><p>
    Other highlights include veteran soul singer Lee Fields' ""Love Comes and Goes"", which backs his gritty soul shout with a large chorus of singers-- an unusual texture that gives the song a participatory feel, as though these people were just sitting around and couldn't help singing along. El Michels Affair checks in with four good tracks, and these are where the compilation deviates most from its revivalist sound template. ""PJ's"", featuring Wu-Tang's Raekwon, is excellent live-band hip-hop with a great, icy keyboard hook.  Previously unreleased bonus track ""Odyssey Revised"", by the Fabulous Three, is driven along by a burbling bass line and has a three-part horn arrangement to die for. It sounds like something that could've come out on Strata in the early 70s.
    </p><p>
    There are a few tracks that don't hit the mark, most notably the two Motown covers. Timothy McNealy's version of ""What's Going On"" is muddled and loses the immediacy of the original by falling short of its grace (the B-side, a country-soul cover of Al Green's ""I'm So Glad You're Mine"", fares much better) and the Funky Music Machine drains all the air from the Four Tops' ""I Can't Help Myself"". It mostly just makes me miss Levi Stubbs. Still, I can deal with a couple of duds on an otherwise good compilation of modern old soul, and it's nice to have all this stuff in one easy-to-access place, even if it doesn't reward the collector spirit the same way the 45s do.

That trend, it appears, has entered the rearview mirror stage, along with the label messes and rehab stints that helped cause those interminable gaps. Consider the new math after <em>The Slip</em> hit hard drives as a free download last Monday: over the last three years, Trent Reznor's released as many full-length records of new material (four) as he did during the first decade of his recorded existence. Since <em>Pretty Hate Machine</em>, the concept behind Reznor's work with Nine Inch Nails has been blunt and straightforward: dystopian techno-metal forged from the fusion of man and machine. But since last year's <em>Year Zero</em>, which came bundled with an alternate-reality video game and high-concept pre-release marketing schedule, and including <em>Ghosts I-IV</em>, which mimicked Radiohead's lossy-leader gimmick, Reznor has slowly emerged as a new sort of cyborg: an artist wholly immersed in the newest digital trends for the distribution and promotion of his music. Like a more magnanimous Radiohead, Reznor's called into question the major-label reserve clause for established, profitable musicians by not just coming up with a new way to monetize music, but just giving it away for free, no strings attached. Instead of ""tip-jar,"" it's ""this one's on me.""</p><p>
    Unlike its most immediate predecessors, <em>The Slip</em> comes packaged with a crucial difference: the music itself is more satisfying than the sui generis marketing scheme. Reznor's unique capacity to commingle raging industrial bangers with ballads and ambient instrumental passages appears in its best form since <em>The Downward Spiral</em>, and here gains much of the focus and restraint that many remember used to be his calling card. At just under 44 minutes, <em>The Slip</em> is Reznor's shortest full-length since <em>Machine</em>, and it indexes many of his most appealing qualities as a songwriter and album sequencer. His former label Interscope still retains the rights to issue a Nine Inch Nails greatest-hits set, but <em>The Slip</em> plays like Reznor's own minor retrospective, fleshed out with plenty of present-day ruminations.</p><p>
    First single ""Discipline"" eschews a typically monstrous chorus for an airtight industrial disco grind ventilated by an airy piano and falsetto cooing. It's another solid pop song about constraint from the guy who, following Prince, brought kinky sex odes to strip-mall bars. This sort of control is of a different stripe than in the past, though: When Reznor asks, ""Is my viciousness losing ground?"", it comes from a long-established and now label-free artist trying to reflexively reassert his position in the pop landscape, on his own terms. One of the pitfalls of perfectionism and digital production is endless tinkering and shapeless experimentation, and ""Discipline"" evinces Reznor's desire for some sort of framework, lest he get too comfortable cranking out 4-LP instrumental opuses from here on out. In relative terms, ""I need your discipline/ I need your help"" is sure a long way from the nearly 20-year-old ""Head Like a Hole"" refrain ""I'd rather die/ Than give you control"".
    </p><p>
    Studio hermeticism is still isolation, though, and ""Discipline"" gives way to ""Echoplex"", in which Reznor's attention is taken by the sound of his voice reverberating throughout the studio. After a quick swipe at those who've insisted he's passed his sell-by date: ""I'm safe in here/ Irrelevant/ Just like they said,"" he casts his tomb as a seductive, slow-torture chamber, cooing: ""My voice just echoes off these walls."" ""1,000,000""-- with any luck, the album's second single-- reappropriates the ""Hurt"" lyric ""a million miles away"" from the context of heroin addiction isolation to a more recent sort of reality-remove, occasioned by a period of declining fortunes for major labels. This sort of self-referentiality seems designed to clarify that Reznor has moved from a self-destructive form of addiction to another, hopefully more productive one.
    </p>
<p>
    While I doubt <em>The Slip</em> recording process resembled <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjpyPqwXNA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>this</strong></a> (although that would be awesome), the liner notes do hint toward a possible shift in method. Session drummer Josh Freese is accompanied by longtime associate Robin Finck (back after a profoundly unproductive period as Slash's replacement in Guns 'n Roses), and keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, and all are listed in the credits as co-performers. I have no idea how much trap-work Freese does on the album itself, but the mixture of live and machined drumming is <em>The Slip</em>'s most appealing sonic quality. It's not a totally new thing, of course-- Dave Grohl played on much of <em>With Teeth</em>-- but here, Reznor strives specifically for, and occasionally hits, the sort of room-mic'd aura that made a song like ""March of the Pigs"" such a visceral experience. The riff-metal on ""Discipline"", ""1,000,000"", ""Head Down"", and ""Demon Seed"" can't compete with the best of the 1989-94 era, but it's clear that Reznor's assessing the best of his peak period through the filter of his post-Fragile activity, and producing some solid songs in the process.
    </p>
<p>
    The hard-hitting first half of <em>The Slip</em> gives way to a second marked by a more patient form of rumination, beginning with the plangent ""Lights in the Sky"", on which Reznor unearths the decaying piano from the Tate Mansion for a song that, like Radiohead's ""Weird Fishes"", finds macabre, romantic pleasure in drowning. ""Lights"" seamlessly blends into the seven-and-a-half minute ambient piece ""Corona Radiata"", which ascends to a noise-filled post-rock crescendo before abruptly cutting to the evocatively-titled ""The Four of Us Are Dying"". Reznor's fondness for instrumental passages on his albums goes back to Broken, but this 12-minute stretch, more than a quarter of <em>The Slip</em>'s runtime and the obvious product of post-<em>Ghost</em> compositional confidence, is the only lag in the album's overall flow. It's much easier to listen to these pieces in the context of a traditional Nine Inch Nails album, to be sure, but the pulsing rhythm of ""Dying"" is nonetheless welcome after ""Corona"", a lengthy indulgence not quite earned.
    </p>
<p>
    The title of ""Dying"" is a nerdy reference from Reznor to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeNSZ--VSlU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>this</strong></a> Twilight Zone"" episode, in which Archie Hammer, a low-life mug, possesses the ability to change his face at will and assume the personalities of the recently deceased. The title is its own spoiler, really, but the episode is more than just an ending; it's a 24-minute meditation on the public performance of identity, and the frightening ramifications that can happen when none of them have any bearing in reality. It's the sort of lesson that Reznor seems to be learning publicly, and occasionally painfully. <em>The Slip</em>, then, allows him to do just that: shift between and reflect upon his various artistic and personal personae, without fear of reprisal. Instead of a symbolic death, <em>The Slip</em> feels much more like a possible rebirth.

    genres. Using a cut-up and collage approach, he's bent folk music,
    jazz, and hip-hop into impossible shapes; each time we seem to draw a bead on
    his style, whether it's folktronica, instrumental hip-hop, or IDM,
    Hebden neatly steps out of the crosshairs to leave us firing at thin
    air. In fact, his music is best understood according to practice. From the folky samples of <em>Pause</em> to the laptop bobbins of <em>Rounds</em>
    to the free-jazzy squalls of his collaborations with drummer Steve
    Reid, Hebden has seemed less interested in developing genres than in
    absorbing their tropes into his own hermetic sound world. What
    distinguishes Four Tet's albums isn't so much the kind of music he
    appropriates as how he uses it, and in this he's been fairly
    consistent: He snips and smears until his sources all but vanish into his
    crisp polyrhythms.</p><p id=""x7y-7"">
    On his superlative album <em>Rounds</em>, Hebden's music did indeed
    seem round: It moved in great languid whorls,
    always closing in on itself. The song ""Spirit Fingers"", which fluttered and darted like a hummingbird, was an
    exception. In retrospect, ""Spirit
    Fingers"" seems to presage the four-song ""mini-album"" <em>Ringer</em>, which is as well-served by its title as <em>Rounds </em>was.
    Here, Hebden can no longer be meaningfully compared
    to Prefuse 73, as the album's dialed-down cut-ups and continuous
    rhythms render it too smoove for IDM.</p><p id=""x7y-11"">
    At four songs, <em>Ringer </em>is economical, but the diversity
    within its half-hour run time makes it surprisingly robust as well.
    This is meant to be Hebden's techno-based album, with flashes of
    Afrobeat and krautrock. You'll catch whiffs of the former in the
    sidewinding percussion of ""Wing Body Wing"", and of the latter in the
    buried pulsation of ""Swimmer"" (not to mention 8-bit techno in the
    pixelated sprays of the title track). But as always, Hebden's latest is most interesting at the level of theme-- <em>Ringer</em> is about concealment
    and revelation, and it gains a great deal of tension in its quick
    juxtapositions of the two.
    </p><p id=""x7y-15"">
    There is something tantalizing about these four tracks, which, at
    times, seems to verge on the lascivious. The title track thrums for ten
    hotwired minutes, but
    there's a sense of something being held back; the loping house beat it
    implies never actually appears. One of its sub-melodies comes into view
    measure by measure, showing a little more of its progression each
    time, like a hem creeping slowly up a thigh. This isn't the Four Tet
    who shoves shunts into his rhythms; ""Ringer"" unfolds with inexorable
    logic. But it's a logic parallel to the one we
    might normally expect, which exhorts a track like this to eventually
    break into a climactic clearing.
    </p>
<p id=""x7y-16"">
    If ""Ringer"" flirts with the thwarted epiphany, then ""Ribbons"" (by my
    reckoning, the album's highlight) makes up for the tease by enacting
    the moment of revelation over and over, rooting itself in the ecstatic
    experience. Hebden punches trills into the seething percussion at various speeds and
    durations, sometimes slow and wet, sometimes quick and ringing;
    sometimes discretely separated, sometimes truncated and overlapped.
    It's the sound of a series of beaded curtains being thrown back,
    divulging more curtains: all revelation, nothing revealed.
    </p>
<p id=""x7y-17"">
    After the flirtatious ""Ribbons"", Hebden pulls back coyly with the
    hypnotic ""Swimmer"": A wavering monotone surrounds it, exposing bits of gargling synths
    and holding back any sort of release until the halfway point, when the
    percussion suddenly snakes through the monotone like ivy. The closing
    track, ""Wing Body Wing"", is slightly less interesting than the others;
    its emphasis on bare-naked percussion makes it sound like half of a <em>Sound of Silver</em>-era
    LCD Soundsystem track. The rhythms are adroit, but seem to long for
    something more. Nevertheless, ""Wing Body Wing"" is the only time when
    the album's strategic omissions dilute its impact rather than
    bolstering it.

    No need to get John Dwyer's lawyers on the phone. This is still, for all
    intents and purposes, the same band that has gone by minutely different handles
    such as OCS and TheOhsees and The Oh Sees. On the surface, this would seem like
    (sigh) OCD; jokes about <em>that </em>TV show are pretty much hacks-only at this
    point, and if Dwyer isn't particularly happy with what we thought of his last
    album, it's still showing up at the bottom anyway. But on <em>The Master's
    Bedroom Is Worth Spending a Night In</em>, consider it a flare gun signaling an
    impending about-face, as the undercooked folk of 2006 release <em>The Cool Death
    Of Island Raiders</em> is jettisoned for an album of a very particular sort of
    desert summer, as influenced by oil stains and scorched blacktop every bit as
    much as gutbucket garage and primordial rock.</p><p>
<em>Master's Bedroom </em>conjures vast stretches of I-10 through the Inland
    Empire, with an occasional heat-stroke mirage along the way (the true-to-title
    ""Graveyard Drug Party""). And while this territory conjures
    wanderlust-induced drives that are often romanticized, in reality, you can go
    for dozens and dozens of miles without feeling like you've gone anywhere. It's
    a natural result of Dwyer mostly working in two gears, namely rough &amp;
    tumble or tough &amp; rumble.</p><p>
    Ostensibly, the intent was to create a simulacrum of 1960s Bay Area
    psychedelics without the marathon solos, and in its own way, <em>Master's
    Bedroom </em>can be as hypnotic and mesmeric as any drone album. Stephen Merritt
    might be the only guy relying on fuzz more heavily in 2008, but while <em>Distortion</em>
    used its namesake to clash with an obvious melodic microstructure, Dwyer's work
    is more suited for muscle cars and barbecues than headphones. If you don't have
    access to the credits, you'd have no idea Dave Sitek worked on three of these
    tracks.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite splitting between Sitek and A-Frames guy Chris Woodhouse, <em>Master
    Bedroom </em>manages to be a consistent record, albeit to a fault at some
    points. Working in a frequency band this narrow is liable to produce slump or
    two over the span of 15 tracks-- the rubber band melody in ""Block of
    Ice"" is an instant pleasure, an imagining of what The B-52's might sound
    like from a passing car. But halfway through the album (particularly on
    ""Ghost in the Trees"") it feels like we've already heard it three different
    times in some minor variation and the megaphone effect on Dwyer's vocals doesn't
    make the lyrics particularly effective milemarkers; this is how the words
    ""block of ice"" end up sounding more like ""fuck all night."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Yet, all this ""but is it art?"" talk is rendered inappropriate when
    you consider this record's just so goddamn fun and loosey-goosey that by comparison,
    the Black Keys sound like Interpol-- tellingly, nearly every single track
    begins with a count-off, the sound of a guitar plugging in or some in media res
    feedback. Usually, that's a cheap ploy for a band to feign garage
    ""authenticity"" while recording in a $500-an-hour studio, but here it
    feels like the natural entry to songs that have Thee Oh Sees getting their
    hands muddy and surprising themselves when they strike oil; listen to how the <em>Nuggets</em>-style
    title track unexpectedly powerlifts its hook, and it's difficult to hear it any
    other way.

    Herman Düne's clip for 
    ""I Wish That I Could See You Soon"", a perfect little puff pastry of a
    song, was one of the best and most criminally under-viewed videos of 2007.
    Featuring some green-screen shots that were all the more charming for being
    unfinished, it was the perfect mesh of visuals and music: puppets and moppets
    running around to a modestly arranged, enormously catchy folk-pop ditty
    complete with horns, angelic back-up singers, and vocalist David-Ivar Herman Dune's
    direct exhortations to the listener. Sporting a pink furry hoodie over his
    full beard, he came across like the greatest camp counselor ever,
    Raffi for twentysomething hipsters-- except, you know, bearable.</p><p>
    More than bearable, actually. After about a decade together,
    Herman Dune-- which consists of Franco-Swedish singer David-Ivar Herman
    Dune and drummer Neman-- have sharpened their craft
    without becoming overly professional or disingenuous. On the band's new EP, <em>I Wish That I Could See You Soon,</em> they play deceptively simple folk-based compositions with flashes of electric
    guitars, horns, mouth harp, and bowed saw. Each song has a similar structure: a
    few short lines followed by the title phrase capping each stanza. A full album
    of songs with this structure might grow repetitive, but on this five-track EP,
    it sounds like a songwriterly signature.</p><p>
    If the music sounds upbeat and whimsical, the subject matter
    very rarely is. David-Ivar writes about the confusions and frustrated yearnings
    of long-distance relationships, and the fact that the band is based in New
    York-- thousands of miles from home-- only reinforces
    the sense of isolation and longing. ""Take Him Back to New
    York City"" relates the pains of a bi-coastal
    relationship, as a transplanted West Coaster pines for an East Coast lover and,
    consequently, for the city they once shared. ""I Wish I Had Someone That I Loved
    Well"", with its Greek chorus of horns, follows an émigré around Coney
    Island as he tries half-heartedly to assimilate. On the other
    hand, the downtempo ""When the Water Gets Cold (And Freezes on the Lake)""
    twists the formula slightly, describing lovers separated not only by geography,
    but by betrayal. ""Right now I need to stay home, and I don't need your company,""
    sings David-Ivar. ""Right now I need to be alone, and I need you to stay away
    from me."" Distance can be therapeutic.
    </p>
<p>
    As a singer, David-Ivar knows his limitations but refuses
    to work around or disguise them. Instead, he embraces them, devising an
    idiosyncratic approach to pop songwriting. Emphasizing his slight range (just
    four or five notes, it seems), he sings in a loose and talky style, becoming
    increasingly conversational as he addresses the horns, back-up singers,
    characters, and even you, the listener. ""And we all go woo woo,"" he declares on
    ""Take Him Back to New York City"", right before the back-up singers coo the
    easy-listening bridge. He's not just warning you that the woo woo's are coming
    up, but also inviting you to sing along. All that's missing is a campfire.

    South Sudan refugee Emmanuel Jal was forced into the Sudan People's Liberation Army when he was six or seven years old (he doesn't know his age), reportedly carrying an assault rifle that was bigger than he was and fighting in the country's second civil war. With the help of a British aid worker he was smuggled into Kenya and eventually made it to London, where he became an internationally-renowned gospel hip-hop artist.</p><p>
<em>Warchild</em> is Jal's second album with a wide commercial release, and it coincides with screenings of a new documentary about his life. A few of the CD's songs deal with the horrors he witnessed as a child. ""Friends like Lual/ Who died by my side from starvation in the baron jungle and the desert plains,"" he raps on ""Forced To Sin"". ""Next was I but Jesus heard my cry/ As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade.""</p><p>
    But the album is less concerned with conflict in his native country than was his extraordinary 2005 collaboration with North Sudan musician Abdel Gadir Salim, <em>Ceasefire</em>. At the time of its release Jal was already popular in parts of Africa due to hits like ""All We Need Is Jesus"" and ""Gua"" (the latter a very nifty piece of pop which also appears on <em>Ceasefire</em>), while Salim was a multi-instrumentalist known for both his traditional and urban North Sudanese sounds. By uniting acclaimed performers on both sides of the civil war's divide, <em>Ceasefire</em> was a political statement at its core, and the music was transcendent as well, highlighted by Salim's stunning folk arrangements and oud playing.
    </p>
<p>
    On that album, Jal rapped in a variety of languages including Arabic, Nuer, and Kiswahili, but <em>Warchild</em> is almost entirely in English, and much of it concerns his struggles in the first world. Afro-pop jam ""Baaki Wara"", the most compelling track, is about groupies and sexual temptation. ""My flesh and my spirit are always fighting/ This evening I met a lady called Daniela/ She is tall, beautiful with smooth skin like roasted beans /...Few hours later I met her friends Jamilla and Amila.""
    </p>
<p>
    Hearing Jal speak on culture shock and sudden fame is more interesting (to me, anyway) than hearing him speak on his childhood-- although perhaps my cynicism comes from recent articles questioning the story of Sierra Leone child soldier Ishmael Beah. But both subjects are preferable to hearing him scold 50 Cent-- or, as his background singers call the Connecticut resident, ""50 Cents."" ""You have done enough damage selling crack cocaine/ Now you got a 'kill a black man' video game,"" he raps. (Earlier in the song he worries, ""You probably hate me."" Um, probably not. It's a safe bet 50 is not going to make a fuss over Jal the way he has over Alicia Keys and Oprah.)
    </p>
<p>
    Jal isn't much of a rapper. He sometimes talks and sometimes flows, but mostly talks. His style is perhaps comparable to Diddy's, both in its lack of luster and its dependence on memorable beats to buttress the songs. But most of <em>Warchild</em>'s production-- done largely by Bahamas-based Roachie, who also co-wrote most of the songs with Jal-- feels watered down. Roachie has diluted the African rhythms with lonely synths, shotgun blasts, and other generica of modern hip-hop. Suffice it to say, Salim is badly missed.

    Love isn't watching someone die, contrary to what Ben Gibbard memorably sang
    on Death Cab for Cutie's major-label debut. No, love is watching someone grow
    and change and still staying with them-- whether we're talking about family,
    friends, romantic interests, or a little college-town indie rock band from
    about an hour-and-a-half outside Seattle. Death is just the dénouement. In the
    three years since their platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated <em>Plans</em>,
    Gibbard and Death Cab producer/guitarist Chris Walla have both entered their thirties, coming off a wave of successes that included 2003's <em>Transatlanticism</em>
    going gold and the debut by Gibbard side project the Postal Service becoming
    Sub Pop's best-selling disc since Nirvana. That's a whole lotta love.</p><p>
<em>Narrow Stairs</em>, Death Cab's second album for Atlantic and sixth proper
    LP overall, is one of the darkest and most muscular in the band's discography,
    but they're still aiming for the same place: your heart. It's an album about
    growing and changing and becoming resigned to the fact that you'll never be
    truly content-- not even if you quit that day job, achieve your rock'n'roll
    dreams, and find yourself in a loving marriage. At times, the maturation feels
    forced; the more adventurous moments here are experimental only for such a
    high-profile group, and they don't play to Gibbard's sentimental, word-weighing
    strengths. Still, even the disappointingly sleepy <em>Plans</em> had ear-catching
    singles, and when Death Cab go with their pop instincts on <em>Narrow Stairs</em>,
    they bang out songs focused and evocative enough to win over maybe a few of
    this loved-and-hated group's longtime skeptics.</p><p>
    There are some vast expanses to navigate first, both production-wise and
    lyrically. Where <em>Transatlanticism</em> spanned an ocean, and <em>Plans</em>
    opened astride ""the East River and Hudson,"" <em>Narrow Stairs</em>
    starts along the California coast, where Gibbard retreated to write the album.
    ""I descended a dusty gravel ridge,"" his bookish tenor begins, in
    clear but vivid language, on ""Bixby Canyon Bridge"". Gibbard has said
    the song is about trying to commune with Jack Kerouac, who stayed in the same
    cabin to write <em>Big Sur</em>. From an initial echoey guitar trill, the track
    grows to pounding, distorted bombast somewhere between <em>OK Computer</em> and
    the new Coldplay single.
    </p>
<p>
    Speaking of singles, <em>Narrow Stairs</em>' first is the eight-and-a-half
    minute ""I Will Possess Your Heart"", a decision that's likely to be
    more successful as brand repositioning than it is as rock music. Death Cab get
    uncompromising-artist points for the four-minute intro that builds up with
    vamping bass, sprinkles of keyboard, and atmospheric guitar, but it's hardly
    essential to the standard-length pop song that follows, about how a
    well-intentioned man can turn into a <em>de facto</em> creepy stalker. ""You
    gotta spend some time, love,"" Gibbard sings, as if by explanation for the
    song's length.
    </p>
<p>
    On <em>Narrow Stairs</em>, Death Cab move from the undergraduate longing of
    their earlier work and the looming mortality of <em>Plans</em> to a more
    generalized existential angst. But they're most successful when they don't
    switch up their style to match; the sound of settling, as <em>Transatlanticism</em>
    maintained, is a peppy ""ba ba,"" not the krautrock pulse of this
    album's synth-touched remainder metaphor, ""Long Division"". Elsewhere,
    the tabla on ""Pity and Fear"" sounds out of place, not far-out; as
    Indian-instrumented songs about an apparent adulterous one-night stand go, this
    one's no ""Norwegian Wood"".
    </p>
<p>
    ""No Sunlight"" cuts through the murk like a beam of, well,
    sunlight-- musically, at least. Bright keyboards and guitars sweeten Gibbard's
    pessimistic lyrics, which contrast childhood bliss with the emptiness of
    adulthood. The best song on the album, ""Cath..."", matches the knotty,
    Built to Spill-style riffs of Death Cab's early records with a plainspoken (and
    gut-wrenching) account of a bride who dooms herself to misery by marrying the
    wrong man. Where fools rush in, Gibbard refuses to rush to judgment: ""I'd
    have done the same as you,"" he concludes.
    </p>
<p>
    What Death Cab have to fear most is not their urge to dabble in different
    genres, but the risk of sounding like a more cloying version of their younger
    selves. On ""You Can Do Better Than Me"", which waltzes its 1960s-pop
    organs way past the line that Ben Folds' ""The Luckiest"" toed like a
    ballerina, Gibbard's nice-guy earnestness becomes too much even for a listener
    who relates to nice-guy earnestness. It's easy to tell where the heavy-handed
    ""Your New Twin Sized Bed"" and ""The Ice Is Getting Thinner""
    are headed as soon as you hear their first lines, and thin ice is a pretty thin
    cliché for such a lyric-focused group. ""Grapevine Fires"" does better,
    adding funereal harmonies and recalling debut LP <em>Something About Airplanes</em>
    with a line about ""wine and some paper cups.""
    </p>
<p>
    Surely Death Cab's awkward position as one of the few indie rock groups with
    a platinum record would be enough to drive anyone to drink. Fellow
    million-sellers Modest Mouse brought on Johnny Marr for their latest
    major-label LP; the Decemberists, who also signed to a major but didn't go
    platinum, have yet to release their follow-up. <em>Narrow Stairs</em>' musical
    growing pains make sense for an album that stares into the banal void of
    contemporary adulthood. If you love the band, you'll probably find enough
    reasons here to keep sticking with them.

But <em>Momofuku</em> returns him to his band the Imposters-- their first in a while, and likely the sort of record most of his fans have been waiting for. Fortunately, it's the best of all that would imply: a fiercely melodic record that sinks or swims on the dynamics of his band, much in the vein of his relative comeback album <em>When I Was Cruel</em> and at times even <em>Blood and Chocolate</em>. The songs are raw and unfussy, and they show off what must come naturally to Costello: tracks stitched together from several disparate and equally unforgettable hooks, and lyrics filled with deft wordplay and plenty of seething and unsatisfied characters.</p><p>
    Most of all the record's songs are wrested from guitar and organ, whether it's the irrepressible pop of ""American Gangster Time"", the hushed, percussive groove of ""Drum and Bone"", or the distorted stomp of ""Stella Hurt"". Extra flourishes are kept to a minimum, with the exception of copious amounts of backing vocals. Costello fears no overdub on ""American Gangster Time"" or ""Pardon Me Madam, My Name is Eve"", while he gets help from a vocal ""supergroup"" bolstered by Jenny Lewis and several others on many of the record's tracks, be their contributions manically layered on ""Drum and Bone"" or just subtle coloring from Lewis on ""Song With Rose"".</p><p>
    From the album's opener, Costello is already aiming at critics in ""No Hiding Place"" who have grown more anonymous as his career has gone on (while taking note of ""The very near future/ When everything will be free""), has no kind words for corruption across the pond in ""American Gangster Time"" (""It's a drag saluting that starry rag""), and finds even finds strife in, depending on your beliefs, the world's first coupling (""Pardon Me Madam, My Name Is Eve""). Yet while Costello is known for his pith, there's a certain amount of gentleness and grown-ass-man maturity present elsewhere: The honking jazz guitar of ""Harry Worth"" almost mocks Costello's previous ballroom pretensions, while the lyrics are like an answer to embittered earlier songs like ""Almost Blue"" or ""The Long Honeymoon"" as the narrator seeks to bring together dueling newlyweds, assuring them, ""it's not very far between tears and mirth.""  Later, the placid ballad ""My Three Sons"" is a hopeful ode to estranged parents and finds glimmers of acceptance in growing old.
    </p><p>
    Even a meat-and-potatoes rock record from Costello would be nothing to complain about, but <em>Momofuku</em> finds small, but significant ways to diversify. Aside from the welcome downshift of ""Harry Worth"", there's a distinctive country twang (no stranger to his catalog) behind the prideful grand piano banging in ""Song for Rose"", while ""Mr. Feathers"" walks the middle ground between woozy Beatlesque melodies and the trashcan symphonies of Tom Waits. There's some percussive feats of wonder as well, from the chaotic clatter that closes out ""Stella Hurt"" to some of the man/machine editing that marked the material from <em>When I Was Cruel</em> on ""Turpentine"", one of two songs where the Imposters swelled to nine musicians, including Pete Thomas' daughter Tennessee from the Like on additional drums.
    </p>
<p>
    It's a remarkably consistent album, but what unifies these songs is how they were recorded, and how Costello and company play to their particular strengths. Even with all these extra musicians-- all valuable players who acquit themselves beautifully, of course-- it goes to show that Costello's songwriting voice is indelible, no matter who is or how many people are playing. While his omnivorous ears and musical appetite should be lauded, perhaps this is why records like these feel like more natural contexts for him. It lacks any standout single to rally around or champion, but maybe it's better that <em>Momofuku</em>'s no-nonsense mood is unbroken. It's the longtime fans who'll be happiest with <em>Momofuku</em>, as the traditional four-piece ""American Gangster Time"" and closing track ""Go Away"", with its harsh vocal echo and buzzing organ, might be as close to vintage Costello as we may ever hear again.

These are words you will find rolling around your mind, for reasons all out of sorts, after listening to the maniacally infectious disco of August Darnell. (Prepare, too, to take stock of the Chippewa, Iroquois, Omaha, and Sioux, lest other tribes go underrepresented.) The couplet comes from ""I'm an Indian Too"" by Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band, one of many acts commanded by Darnell during an era when disco knew no bounds. It certainly didn't on any of the tracks compiled on <em>Going Places: The August Darnell Years 1976-1983</em>, a collection of stuttering, stately, and studiously weird disco songs that have to be heard to be believed. Darnell was involved in Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band before branching out as a writer/producer for other acts (many on the fabled crypto-disco label Ze Records) and then for his own group Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts. Common to them all are theatrical airs, irrepressible grooves, and fateful moments, however subtle or pronounced, that give rise to reactions classifiable only as WTF?!?!</p><p>
    The new compilation starts with Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band's ""Sunshower"", a spritzy song that has become ubiquitous thanks to samples by Ghostface and M.I.A., among others. From there, <em>Going Places</em> goes places where idiosyncrasy and ambition reign. The title track, by Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts, struts through a funky mix of rhythm guitar and dryly shaken cymbals before breaking for a vibraphone solo and an eerie few-note guitar refrain that plays like something out of Blue Öyster Cult's ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"". In ""Is That All There Is?"", singer Cristina broods about nightlife boredom with coy high-style jadedness before assenting to ""let's keep dancing"" (and this in the midst of a musique concrète interlude complete with cuckoo clock and restless crowd sounds).</p><p>
    Some of the songs on <em>Going Places</em> were made for dance-theater projects in the East Village in the 1980s, but one gets the sense that, for Darnell, a blank reel of tape was as conducive to theatricality as any commissioned stage. The parade of vocalists on display-- snappy divas, choruses of kids, uncertain guys who sound like they were just pulled away from sweeping up the studio-- makes for an uncommonly wide range of expression. And the music follows suit. The disco-vocal histrionics in Machine's ""There But for the Grace of God Go I"", so intense you can practically see the veins rising on the singers' foreheads, sound calm compared to a synth-streaked instrumental breakdown with sweaty funk guitars and blitzing bass runs too controlled to worry over mere concerns of the humanly realm. A similar mood plays out in slow songs like Aural Exciters' ""Emile (Night Rate)"", which cycles through a carnival of ideas without rising above a simmer.
    </p><p>
    The most striking aspect of <em>Going Places</em> is how little a sense of novelty figures into songs so outrageously playful and weird. The bizarre parts are never bizarre for no reason, and they're played (often by many, many band members) with too much spirit and skill to rate as stunts. It's hard to imagine dance music half as grand and imaginative being made today. But then, August Darnell would be hard to account for in any era.

    Sébastien Tellier shares little sonically with fellow French shapeshifter Serge Gainsbourg, but he has adopted some of the man's most endearing sensibilities, namely, an embrace of artifice and a willingness to genre-hop well beyond his expected limitations. Gainsbourg made worthwhile reggae and art rock records chiefly because he approached each style fearlessly, unaware or uncaring of how these records would look amongst the rest of his work; Tellier stepped well outside his comfort zone-- and not necessarily successfully-- on 2004's world music experiment <em>Politics</em> before shifting to groovy (literally) soundtrack work on 2006's <em>Sessions</em>. <em>Sexuality</em>, his fourth album, moves toward erotic synth-pop in what might be a more stereotypically French pursuit, but Tellier's willingness to engage the material without contempt or parody leads to an album of unexpected charm and grace.</p><p>
    That grace is key, too: <em>Sexuality</em>'s goofball cover invites comparisons to another Frenchman with sex on the brain-- Pepé Le Pew-- but the album's artwork is its only obvious ham, Tellier wisely choosing to bypass smoove in favor of smooth. <em>Moon Safari</em>, by former touring partners (and label heads) Air, might seem like an obvious touchstone, but <em>Sexuality</em>, produced by Daft Punk's Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, is far more kinetic, laying metronomic sequencers over patient chord changes. Tellier moves easily between English and French and his surprisingly accomplished husk keeps lyrics largely indecipherable; camp and humor are by no means absent-- please see the female moans that effectively constitute the chorus of ""Pomme""-- but they're a smaller piece of the pie than expected, considering the cover features a man riding a donkey on a naked woman's torso.</p><p>
    Nothing on <em>Sexuality</em> is as stormily danceable as non-album single ""Sexual Sportswear"" but Tellier does favor tiny pipe-cleaner rhythms in his pop: ""Kilometer"" surfs around in-the-red synthesizer stabs; a flanged, bending guitar riff sets the stage for the urban lounge of ""Une Heure""; ""Manty"" draws a pulse from a woman's sampled syllabic ""huh hah""'s. ""Look"" best encapsulates <em>Sexuality</em>'s sporty hook-making: slow changes, percussive synths, Tellier cooing over the top. You'll nod the tune right out of your head before the next track begins.
    </p>
<p>
    That is, of course, <em>Sexuality</em>'s greatest weakness. Tellier's talents and interests are manifold; he is, perhaps necessarily, a moodmaker rather than a songsmith. <em>Sexuality</em>'s stylistic choices offer him plenty of leeway, allowing him to sneak forgettable hooks by with precise atmosphere and committed style. <em>Sexuality</em> is-- forgive the pun-- a labor of love; how else to explain the ""L'Amour et La Violence"", the album's multifarious coda? Mournful electric piano cedes Tellier's plaintive voice cedes spidery electronica; Tellier is a gorger, feeding on many interests and trying to cater to them all. Indulge and enjoy both his shortcomings and his triumphs; he is unlikely to return to them.

Bright, cheery, bouncy, shiny: pretty much the true sound of Los Angeles, in 1966. A critic or two might've groused that groups like the Beach Boys and the Beatles were drowning out real American rock'n'roll-- who would squander their good American gin-and-glue buying power to consume this surfer-limey drivel?-- but a gazillion years later, it's pretty clear which old farts won that battle. For confirmation, look no further than the six young men of the Explorers Club, who in 2008 have created nothing less than a full-fledged teenage symphony to Brian Wilson.</p><p>
    More than a decade after the likes of the High Llamas and the Elephant 6 groups helped revive interest in the Beach Boys' psychedelic period, and only a year after Panda Bear's Wilson-tripping <em>Person Pitch</em>, the Explorers Club have refreshingly more innocent ideas. The Charleston, S.C. band's full-length debut, <em>Freedom Wind</em>, like their self-released <em>The Explorers Club</em> EP before it, takes inspiration from the Beach Boys' songs about girls and fun in the sun, from the years before and after their Chuck Berry-style rock'n'roll was replaced by sounds that were more complex and disturbing-- <em>Holland</em> as much as <em>Today!</em>, with some of <em>Friends</em>' low-key charm. Hell, from their Spector-lush production to their layered vocal harmonies, and even into some specifics of their compositional structures, songs like the EP's ""Don't Forget the Sun"" or singles ""Last Kiss"" and ""Do You Love Me?"" could almost be mistaken for lost Beach Boys sides. What could come as higher praise?</p><p>
<em>Freedom Wind</em> includes three of the four songs on the Explorers Club's original EP, and it partly fulfills that record's promise. Especially if you like the Beach Boys.  They've even got the studio banter, like at the start of ""Lost My Head"", in which high, swirling vocals rise over organs and tremolo guitar; the repeated ""my friend"" is also reminiscent of r&amp;b group Shai's a cappella 1992 hit, ""If I Ever Fall in Love"" (a personal favorite). Opener ""Forever"" starts off, appropriately enough, like ""Be My Baby"", and it has a guitar solo that uses the fundamental idea of the Beach Boys' rudimentary ""Don't Worry Baby"" solo. Elsewhere, the Explorers Club show they can do something other than slavish recreations of familiar Beach Boys sounds, on ""Honey I Don't Know Why"", although the song's raspy vocals unfortunately make for the album's most jarring track.
    </p><p>
    Name me one 1960s superstar who hasn't become a zombie-- revivified like
    the Beatles as Oasis, Hendrix as Kravitz, or all those new Dylans (Lou Reed was once a professional
    zombie). The Explorers Club deserve more credit for so masterfully distilling a beloved style that other bands of their age group have long ignored, just as the Pipettes or El Perro Del Mar can't be faulted for looking to their own, similar '60s pop niches for inspiration. But where <em>Pet Sounds</em> gives a highly personal, resonant look at love and its place in a young man's life, <em>Freedom Wind</em> is full of anachronisms, even down to ""been steady"" on the still-lovely ""Last Kiss"". Why would a band with the clear arranging and compositional chops of the Explorers Club settle for being, at best, your second-favorite group?
    </p>
<p>
    And, if I were (and remember, this is a hypothetical, haha) to expertly copy my favorite bits of Beach Boys-related rockcrit by Jules Siegel, Nick Tosches, Greil Marcus, Lester Bangs, Jim DeRogatis, and Jim Fusilli-- following their every footstep and participating in burning out with their once-brilliant movement, as Vlaminck, Derain, Van Dongen, and others participated in the brilliant flash that was Fauvism at the turn of the 20th century-- and still not quite make them my own, well, then what would Richard Meltzer say about Jan and Dean?

By July 10, he had become something else entirely: It took only 24 hours to lay down 10 of the 11 songs that would make up <i>Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul</i>, arguably the 1960s' greatest studio-recorded soul LP. (The only track not recorded at that time was the #2 hit, ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"".) Friends and associates had noticed Redding's growing confidence as a singer, and once <i>Otis Blue </i>hit shelves it was clear he was poised enough to pick up the mantle of the recently slain legend Sam Cooke, up to that point the greatest soul singer in America. He was also prepared to take on the Temptations and the Rolling Stones and B.B.King on their own turf; the only way to top him would be to give one of his original compositions to Aretha Franklin (""Respect""). In the simplest terms: It's a hell of a record, the crowning achievement of a man who could sound pained and celebratory and tender and gritty and proud all at once, with a voice that everyone from John Fogerty to Swamp Dogg to Cee-lo owes a debt to.</p>
<p>Rhino's 2xCD Collector's Edition of <i>Otis Blue </i>makes a good case for this 24-hour labor of love as a wide-reaching document that just gets better with context. A set this packed-- including rarities, alternate mixes, live versions of the album tracks, and the original LP in both mono and stereo-- could easily feel sprawling and overstuffed, but it does a great job illuminating every tweaked nuance and permutation that Redding and his top-notch band could come up with during the course of a song's lifetime. Considering the personnel involved in the original LP-- Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s guitarist Steve Cropper, bassist Donald ""Duck"" Dunn, and drummer Al Jackson Jr.; keyboardist Isaac Hayes; a horn section (saxophonists Floyd Newman and Andrew Love, trumpet players Wayne Jackson and Gene Miller) filled with members of the Mar-Keys and the Memphis Horns-- it's a blessing to hear them both unified in mono and isolated in stereo.  (Any concerns of redundancy can be  allayed thusly: the mono version's for your speakers; stereo's for your headphones. You need them both.)     And the singer holding it together is at the top of his game. There's the possibility that the death of Cooke not only inspired Redding to record three of his idol's most well-known songs, but spurred him to step up and fill an aching void in popular music, and it's not blasphemous to suggest that Otis measures up. His version of ""Wonderful World"" matches the original's tone of winsome modesty and gives it a rougher edge, and his juke-joint version of ""Shake"" is a hard-swinging, full-throated 2:40 of precision ferocity with a force that would flat-out explode during his live sets. But ""Change Gonna Come"", his take on Cooke's civil rights anthem ""A Change Is Gonna Come"", is the real gem of the three: the moment he sings ""I was born by the river,"" you can tell he knows what he's been entrusted with, and he handles it superbly with a mix of raspy frustration and wounded gentleness that's part trained virtuosity and part raw emotion.</p>
<p>Like most other albums of the time, there's no shortage of covers, most of which fall under the milieu of Southern rhythm &amp; blues: a sweltering take on B.B. King's ""Rock Me Baby"", with some of the best-timed ""heh"" asides this side of James Brown; a stomping version of Solomon Burke's ""Down in the Valley"" that ratchets up both the gospel beatitude and the secular lust; the staggering reworking of William Bell's ""You Don't Miss Your Water"" that has one of the most devastating pleading-man lead vocals in the entire Stax catalog. But there's also two other covers that really show what Redding could do in a different sort of pop context. Of all the versions of ""My Girl"" that sprang up in the wake of the Tempations' career-making December 1964 release, Otis' is especially inspired, twisting its familiar melodies against it and interjecting a few unexpected pauses and shifted inflections; the way he delivers its once-familiar chorus just a little off-balance can deke you right out of your socks. (Much of Redding's popularity in the UK hinged on this track, which was released in England by Atlantic to capitalize on the fact that it was one of the few places the Temptations' version hadn't caught on.) And his transformative take on ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", growling and sneering and wailing against a 90-mph backbeat sounds like even more of an impressive accomplishment whenyou take into account the fact that he hadn't even heard the Rolling Stones' original version at the time he recorded the song. He simply went off the lyrics and embellished them where he saw fit-- underscoring the ""fashion"" in ""satisfaction"" or throwing in new verses that turned Mick and Keith's restlessness into sheer uncontrollability (""I keep on runnin' round in my sleep/ I keep on messin' up any beat"").</p>
<p>The covers are supplemented on this collection by four originals, two of which-- the mournfully harried ""Ole Man Trouble"" and the Jerry Butler-co-written ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"" with its priceless ending crescendo of desperation-- are evidence enough that he wasn't just a flashy interpreter. Another is ""I'm Depending on You"", the B-side to ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"", and it's a simple, perfectly fine vehicle for him to turn unremarkable lyrics into remarkable vocalizations. The other one, of course, is ""Respect""-- the song that Redding liked to joke was ""stolen"" from him by Aretha Franklin. It's true, in a sense-- Franklin claimed ownership of the song the moment she recorded it-- but it would be doing Redding a great disservice to consider his original an afterthought. Even without the brassy attitude and feminist overtones in Franklin's iconic rendition, Redding's performance is singular enough to avoid being canceled out. His band's performance isn't as much of a first-round-knockout as the one by the team Jerry Wexler and Arif Mardin assembled for the Queen of Soul (no slight-- what performance is?), but had it never been covered, Redding's version would be more vividly remembered as one of his greatest moments as a singer and a songwriter: it's no small feat to take the situation of a man asking for respect from a woman and deliver it while sounding more like a romantic diplomat than a chauvinist asshole. Better yet, there's an alternate version-- recorded around 1967 under unclear circumstances-- that  compresses it all into a hectic, high-speed 1:51.  It is <i>completely insane.</i></p>
<p>Redding wasn't yet famous enough in September '65 to circumvent one of the era's most unfortunate record company practices: instead of Redding's face on the cover of <i>Otis Blue</i>, there's a blue-tinted photo of a non-descript white lady. But through 1966 and early 1967, Redding had steadily built on his notoriety and recognition amongst both black r&amp;b and white rock audiences by structuring one of pop music's most energizing live shows largely on the backbone of this album's material. This collection gathers selected <i>Otis Blue</i> tracks and B-sides from his April 1966 sets at Los Angeles' Whisky a Go Go and his mesmerizing March 1967 performance recorded for that year's <i>Live in Europe</i>, the last Otis Redding recording released during his lifetime. The two shows couldn't be more different: The L.A. show features a crew of musicians that trade the studio band's painstaking precision for a rough, loose, almost garage-band quality-- ""Ole Man Trouble"" damn near sounds like it's backed by an especially raw nu-funk group like El Michels Affair -- and the Europe show sports Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s in their tourniquet-tight entirety, roaring to be heard over an armada of screaming teenagers. Redding sounds at home in both venues, pouring his heart into each song and singing it the way you'd want a brand-new fan to hear it-- and all those brand-new fans came about because of an album that took one day to create.</p></div>"|11376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11376-otis-blue-otis-redding-sings-soul-collectors-edition/|10.0|Nate Patrin

    It was another surprising detour in a career composed almost exclusively of detours: Isobel Campbell, former Belle &amp; Sebastian member and sometime solo act, teamed with Mark Lanegan, taciturn former Screaming Trees singer and serial collaborator. With the release of their <em>Ballad of the Broken Seas</em>, the ""Beauty and the Beast"" lines came fast and furious. So did the Nancy and Lee comparisons, which were probably welcome. The pairing of Lanegan and Campbell may have come as a shock to fans of the latter (and maybe even the former) but the music itself was less than revelatory. Indeed, the Lee Hazelwood/Nancy Sinatra template is iconic for a reason, and to borrow it means to risk imitating them. It also means treading closely to Leonard Cohen, Scott Walker, or any other somber, late-1960s orchestral pop act.</p><p>
    Still, the results were beautiful and brooding, with Campbell's songwriting significantly enhanced by this very specific setting. Sequels, however, are inherently built on  familiarity and a sequel to the solid yet by-the-books <em>Ballad of the Broken Seas</em> could be as problematic as the Hollywood models are. Yet while <em>Sunday at Devil Dirt</em> may be more of the same (with glimpses of Tom Waits' junkyard blues tossed in to good effect), Campbell and Lanegan were never out to do anything different. Once again, melancholy, minor-key folk melodies, and bits of spy-theme and spaghetti-western cool color the album, typically enhanced by only the classiest of accompaniment-- upright bass, strings, brushed drums, twangy electric guitars, and other chamber-pop mainstays. And once again, Campbell works better as a supporting player on her own record than as a leader, cooing and chiming away in the background. Sure, she provides most of the songwriting, but it's Lanegan who provides the gravitas.</p><p>
    Fortunately, Campbell seems to realize her place here as writer and arranger first and foremost, generally ceding the spotlight to Lanegan on the likes of the bleak (of course) ""The Raven"" and ""Back Burner"", the somewhat lighter country-blues of ""Salvation"" and ""Sally Don't You Cry"", and the spare folk of ""Something to Believe"". Compared to Lanegan, Campbell sounds thin singing lead on ""Shot Gun Blues""  or as duet partner on ""Who Built the Road"" and ""The Flame That Burns"". Her vocals are almost like post-production special effects.
    </p>
<p>
    In a lot of ways that's what makes the disc such a good, breezy listen. Campbell's turn on ""Come On Over (Turn Me On)"" aims for sultry yet can't get beyond sweet and innocent; in Lanegan, however, she's found a substitute singer that's a perfect match for the strength of her compositions, a rumbling, grumbling vessel through which to channel her songs, themselves channeling the vibe of a lost but not forgotten time of smoky bars, scratchy jukeboxes, convertibles, open roads, broken hearts, cheap motels, and cheaper thrills. It's a bit like a dust-specked and flickering faux Super-8 road trip reel, with Campbell manning the camera and sitting in the director's chair and Lanegan glowering away in the uncomfortable glare of the sun.

    Think you might've had Fonal's M.O. figured by now, didja?
    Fractal, often improvised electro-acoustic noise; shades of spirituality;
    collectives and excitable art-children. The Finnish label's new project, Eleanoora
    Rosenholm, shatters all of those preconceptions save the final one, as a trio
    of veterans and a handful of friends convene (even when taking a singular name
    and writing bizarre first-person <a href=""http://www.fonal.com/shop/eleanoorarosenholm_vainajanmuotokuva_cd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Dear John letters</strong></a>, Finnish artists travel in
    packs) to craft an art-disco rollercoaster that defies much of the rest of the
    label's catalogue.</p><p>
<em>Vainajan Muotokuva</em> opens with the attention-grabbing ""Musta
    Ruusu"", which immediately springs the album's unexpected list of
    touchstones: ABBA, Madonna, Kylie Minogue. Disco influences also abound and
    they are ""Italo-"" in as much as they are born from polished, attentive
    programming and not, say, funk or rock'n'roll. There is a tendency to mentally
    smooth over albums sung in foreign languages-- Noora Tommila's unfamiliar
    syllables, however clearly they are articulated, seem to come unlodged from her
    throat in indefinable clumps-- but it doesn't take long for <em>Vainajan
    Muotokuva</em> varied stylistic conceits to reveal themselves.</p><p>
    The rumbling bassline and slyly rhythmic chimes of ""Kopiokissa""
    seemingly snuck out of Massive Attack's sequencers. The frantic kit-work and
    ""bum bum buh buh""'s of ""Kodinrakennusohjeet"" expose
    krautrock roots. ""Japanilainen Puutarha"", which contorts around a
    click-clacking snare, monosyllabic guitar line, and woozy synths, is almost
    Timbalandian in the way its busyness rises from an economic arrangement.
    There's also ""Pyhäpietarinaukio"", which spends two minutes on an
    ambient think-piece more akin to Fonal's natural order, but its dark serenity
    explodes into ""Kiltti Vai Tuhma"", the most blatantly pop-baiting
    track on <em>Vainajan Muotokuva</em> (possibly in the Fonal universe). Burly
    closer ""Maailmanloppu"" steals the Transylvania-ian bells from the
    Smashing Pumpkins ""Disarm"" and rolls them into a jerky, stepping
    bassline, paving the way for a choir-like group chorus that stands as the most
    ostentatious moment on an album full of idiosyncrasies. 
    </p>
<p>
    Despite the bands and styles cited above, <em>Vainajan Muotokuva</em> is only
    nominally a dance or disco album. At their most propulsive, during
    ""Maailmanloppu"", Eleanoora aren't going to move a lot of sneakers. <em>Vainajan
    Muotokuva</em> is a headspace tempest, but one that is distinctly foreign. Even
    as repeated listens uncover familiar modes and styles, Tommila's melodies
    remain windily Scandinavian. Any familiarity or placidity brought about by the
    influences in play here is frequently and probably intentionally interrupted by
    jarring, ill-fitted sound effects. Still, it is comforting to pronounce the
    album titles phonetically and to hear them repeated during the song-- as on
    ""Musta Ruusu""-- because it reassures your brain that these are the
    type of songs-- pop songs-- in which the title is used as a refrain.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Vainajan Muotokuva</em>, even when playing genre hopscotch, never feels like
    the work of a collective, but rather that of a vocalist and a particularly
    astute programmer, à la Giorgio Moroder or Maurice Fulton. These slight
    subversions of precedent help to define an otherwise slippery album: salty
    Euro-pop, shiftless disco, communal focus. <em>Vainajan Muotokuva</em> stands as
    an outlier for Fonal musically but it rather perfectly embodies the label's
    spirit of exploration.

    The closing track on the Strugglers' <em>The Latest Rights </em>is
    called ""My Slow Reflection"", and it's a title that's pretty damn
    emblematic of leader Randy Bickford's artistic mission as a whole. His entire aim here amounts to a deliberate
    examination both of clear, concrete moments and diffuse philosophical
    states, each impression turned over and parsed with exquisite care. The
    ruminative, metaphysical bent of North Carolina-based Bickford's
    alt-countryish musings is only emphasized by his cracked, weary voice
    (invariably likened to Will Oldham's,
    though being deeper, Bickford's instrument is often closer to Eddie
    Vedder's), slow-shuffling musical accompaniment, and long lyrical lines.</p><p>
    Bickford is fond of tracing a single thought or sketching a single
    image throughout the winding course of several bars, building suspense
    and making you wait patiently for the pay-off, which typically feels
    like a reward even when it's something as relatively banal as ""So when
    are you going to turn yourself in one direction"". Still, there's a
    pregnant pause between ""in"" and ""one"" which, when bridged, finds the
    sense of the phrase dramatically changed. The title track in particular
    is like a drawing made without once lifting the pen, its gradual
    coalescing perfectly mirrored in the lyrics' theme of youthful
    self-discovery.  At
    times, Bickford's concerns are even more archetypal, like the elliptical
    but weighty considerations of beauty, mythology, and innocence that make
    up ""Jonathan"" (paradoxically the album's sprightliest and crunchiest
    rock offering). But it's not all vagary-- the aforementioned ""My Slow
    Reflection"" includes a line, ""I was spurred always by the points in my
    life,"" that encapsulates Bickford's frequent willingness to interrupt
    his allusive sifting and bring out a single tangible image or fact for
    equivalent inspection. He does have an eye for lyrical detail, whether it's a picture of being ""right in the
    sunlight with my eyes closed"" on the war-themed ""Redeployment"", or the
    memory of ""what you said when Donna's baby was born"" in ""New Form"",
    which leads in short time to a more characteristically nebulous
    meditation on aging and the creation of identity.</p><p>
    Musically,
    <em>The Latest Rights </em>is occasionally distinguished by stately strings
    (""Morningside Heights"", ""Limerence"") but more reliably ranges from
    forgettable unobtrusiveness to pleasantly self-regulating disinterest.
    Bickford often seems impervious to the musical shifts that go on behind
    him, but it only helps add to the record's sense of unheeded meandering
    and organic self-realization. ""I'm
    soaking in your various shades,"" Bickford wearily attests on the moody,
    horn-graced ""Theme for the Bad Angels"", and it's a state to which we as
    listeners can relate in immersing ourselves in his subtle,
    ever-blurring emotional modulations. The opposite of histrionic,
    Bickford offers a subdued palette rich in the fineness of its

    I first heard Austin's Sound Team some six or seven years ago, back when I
    wrote for an online demo review column. They were kind of dilapidated and sloppy,
    but I liked them for it, and not just because they didn't sound like the same
    nu-metal or half-assed Lookout! punk or cheap Sunny Day Real Estate knockoff
    crap I usually reviewed. I got this great lo-fi psych vibe out of them that
    proved to be hard to define, exactly, except in terms of atmosphere: sort of
    logey, kind of humid, with a great deal of heavy, clanky fuckaroundery. Over
    the next few years I found some low-key joy in their 2004 cassette-only release
    <em>Yes</em>, then more or less lost track of them despite their relatively
    high-profile signing to Capitol and the release of their 2006 major label debut
    <em>Movie Monster</em>. Maybe I should've paid a bit more attention before they
    broke up: any band that responds to a Pitchfork pan with <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/37217-sound-team-strike-back"">a
    video attempting to depict Marc Hogan's thumbs-down in the most literal terms
    possible</a></strong> has to have something going for 'em somewhere. After founder
    and multi-instrumentalist Bill Baird went from the defunct Sound Team to his own
    project as {{{Sunset}}}, the PR guy for Autobus offered to send me a few CDs of
    his, as well as a cassette. After accepting the CDs but mentioning that I
    didn't actually have a working cassette player anymore, they actually spent $12
    on postage to send me a beat-up tape deck.</p><p>
    All that weirdly-guided
    effort and oddball behavior really makes me wish I liked this CD a lot more
    than I do. Considering that the two Bill Baird solo/proto-{{{Sunset}}} CDs I
    got in that tape deck package held a lot of promise-- they were unrepentantly strange
    and darkly funny in a way that reminded me of Beck if <em>Mellow Gold </em>tanked and
    he never met the Dust Brothers, deciding instead to keep going on the <em>Stereopathetic
    Soulmanure </em>path-- <em>Bright Blue Dream </em>is surprisingly short on ideas,
    even if the atmosphere almost makes up for it. The compromise between lo-fi
    aesthetics and Spiritualized-level grandiosity works fairly well, and the
    album's first half is workable enough as a mixed bag of shoegaze-pop
    fundamentals. While ""I Love My Job"" is a speedbump-- the first-draft Spoon
    piano and obvious office-woe lyrics make it catchy but not much else-- the
    eerie chiming whirr of opener ""Dear Broken Friend"" and the evocative new
    wave/synth-psych ""Diamond Studded Caskets"" are legitimately beautiful in a
    disconnected and ill-fitting sort of way. Even if it comes too close to a polished,
    hypnotic tautness for the sloppy edges to be excusable, the sound on <em>Bright
    Blue Dream </em>has some appeal when driving percussive compositions are run
    through it.</p><p>
    It's the ambient, overlong
    second half that drags things down. The simple structure of ""Moebius"" vaguely works
    because capping off its leaning-on-a-synth hum with a crescendo of keening
    guitar is pretty much the only logical way to end a song like that on an album
    like this, but ""Golden Reverie""-- a drum-free, piano-driven melodic piece
    augmented by mysterious effects pedal/worn-out Mellotron debris-- is three
    minutes' worth of prettiness stretched out to five and a half minutes' worth of
    repetition. The downpitched, dying-battery banjo-and-handclap bluegrass of ""Old
    Sandy Bull Lee"" is evocatively ramshackle, but the two-minute whining keyboard
    coda sounds less like an ascent into some higher plane of freak-folk and more
    like things just petering out. And the endless drone of ""Bright Blue Dream"" is
    Eno without a point: when listening to the 14-plus-minute title cut leaves
    me with the same impression as a seven-second transitional track, something
    ain't right. Like the (apparently optional) curly brackets around Sunset's name,
    the bloat around this album makes a perfectly accessible core into a
    bewildering mess-- even if, more often than not, it's also a compelling mess.

Beginning with 2001's <em>A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure</em>, the combined output of Martin Schmidt and Drew Daniel (a Pitchfork contributor) so far this decade has seen them work within the form of some pre-established conceptual constraint. <em>A</em> <em>Chance to Cut</em> saw them fashion malformed, sideways techno out of samples culled from the operating theater; 2003's <em>The Civil War</em> was a blissfully uncool meditation on medieval instrumentation and American folk history; and 2006's <em>The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of a Beast</em>, their most audacious and satisfying record, was a collection of bespoke sound and thought experiments dedicated to a cast of gay or closeted figures: Ludwig Wittgenstein, Larry Levan, Valerie Solanas, King Ludwig II of Bavaria.</p><p>
    It might be tempting for non-fans to imagine these conceptual parameters as being too intellectually grounded to yield much in the way of, oh, you know, fun, but fans have come to embrace them as part of the deal. That's partly because of Matmos' inherent sense of playfulness, humor, and energy-- they're just as comfortable being buffoons or instigators as they are intellectuals. But it's also because there's something strangely engaging about their transparent working process. If you know the backstory to a particular record, it's impossible to hear it and not entertain questions about how they might work within those bounds. By the simple act of listening, you become a participant.</p><p>
    But unlike <em>The Rose Has Teeth</em>, which might easily have come with an annotated bibliography of assigned supplementary reading, the underpinning idea behind <em>Supreme Balloon</em> revolves around a simple aesthetic limitation. This time around, Schmidt and Daniel stashed away their DAT recorders, microphones, and idle hurdy gurdys and vowed to record using only synthesizers as input sources. While there's comparatively little in the way of outside text to grapple with as a result, the decision opens the door on some gorgeous sonic shifts; spanning everything from standard-issue old-school Moogs, Arps, and Waldorfs to slightly more obscure modular antiques (indeed, if <em>The Rose Has Teeth</em> underlined Schmidt and Daniel's day jobs as accomplished academics, this exposes them as shameless gearsluts), <em>Supreme Balloon</em> is a woozily beautiful-sounding record, as crystalline, gleaming, and full-bodied as vintage Terry Riley.
    </p><p>
    That throwback spirit is underscored by the album's sequencing. <em>Supreme Balloon</em> comes split into two discernible sides, the former a collection of five ""pop"" numbers that includes the futzed-up circuitry of opener ""Rainbow Flag"", the punchy, almost-techno of the sprightly ""Polychords"", and the carbonated, 8-bit harp glissandos of ""Exciter Lamp"" (which features, weirdly and wonderfully, a brief passage from ""O Canada""). Side two begins with the album's obvious centerpiece; clocking in at over 23 minutes long, the eponymously-titled ""Supreme Balloon"" is a chasm-wide, slow burning bit of analog psychedelia that conjures up very obvious comparisons to Vangelis and Tangerine Dream in their mid-70s heyday. A bubbling drone piece called ""Cloudhopper"" acts as the closer, and we're done.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Supreme Balloon</em> features contributions from Keith Fullerton Whitman, Jay Lesser, and Sun Ra Arkestra's Marshall Allen, among others, while Riley himself appears on a bonus track of the iTunes version of the record. In the end, those appearances point to the album's only downside, which is the nagging sense that there's too much straight homage/pastiche and not enough of Matmos' considerable cleverness on display. Ultimately, though, it's a minor quibble; as Matmos surely know, beautiful sounds are their own kind of reward.

    Back when the Brian Jonestown Massacre became the newest Next Big Thing-- releasing albums at the rate of Bob Pollard powered by Red Bull, flirting with interested record labels of varying liquidity, engaging in slapfights with the Dandy Warhols and fistfights with bandmates-- the myth and mystique surrounding the group all but drowned out its songs.  All the while, frontman Anton Newcombe wanted people to believe he was a burgeoning genius bucking the establishment, a tortured outcast inspired by and continuing the work begun by his spiritual forefathers from the 1960s, including one or both of the guys whose names or notorious actions were jacked for use in Newcombe's little beat combo.</p><p>
    With every subsequent release, however, the myth gave way to a less flattering portrait.  Although Newcombe was talented enough to skillfully synthesize all sorts of musical touchstones, the end results were increasingly less inspiring, and his tendency to take decent ideas and beat them into the ground was maddening-- Newcombe never failed to take what could be a perfectly fine three-minute song and turn it into an interminable seven-minute dirge.  Couple those aesthetic shortcomings with Newcombe's  penchant for burning bridges and buying into his own out-of-proportion hype, and it's no wonder that the group quickly became yesterday's news.  Ironically, Brian Jonestown Massacre's most public moment came courtesy of the 2004 documentary <em>Dig!</em>, with the film's unflattering portrayal of Newcombe and the group's overwrought inner turmoil showing exactly why the group would never become as big as Newcombe thought they should be.  Undaunted, Newcombe and whomever he can sucker into joining his merry band soldier on, releasing records, playing out, causing the occasional ruckus.  If the hope is to return to those salad days of potential world domination, lackluster albums like <em>My Bloody Underground</em> aren't going to help the cause.</p><p>
    Given its title, it's fitting that the self-produced <em>My Bloody Underground</em> attempts to emulate both the gauzy atmospherics of My Bloody Valentine and the sparse efficiency of the Velvet Underground.  Instead, the album often sounds more like a poorly recorded group of proficient amateurs giving it a go on fourth-hand guitars and some empty paint buckets, with the singer warbling through a pillow for good measure.  The album's lead track (the name of which I'll get to later on) starts with a promising beat, but gets sideswiped not three seconds in by the intrusion of the meandering psychedelic guitar mangling one might stereotypically expect from a group beholden to that forever-romanticized era of free love.  After six minutes of that, there's an electrified version of the same pointless stumble that lasts just as long.  Most of the album offers variations on this sort of unending drone-- ""Who Fucking Pissed in My Well?"" is a non-vocal synth-driven take, ""Just Like Kicking Jesus"" goes the MBV seasick route,  ""Who Cares Why"" sends the drone out into orbit, and the album's percussion-free conclusion is fittingly titled ""Black Hole Symphony"".  Oddly enough, despite being the longest track on the entire record, it's probably the most palatable.
    </p>
<p>
    The songs that avoid this sonic quicksand aren't worth much, either-- successes like the haunting ""Ljosmyndir"" and refreshingly aggressive ""Golden - Frost"" are few and far between.  Instead, there's ""Yeah - Yeah"", a haze-free number where Newcombe's usually submerged vocals take center stage to offer a litany of ridiculous couplets.  There's also a pleasant enough piano instrumental, supposedly written by Newcombe when he was nine years old, that soon overstays its welcome.  And in case the album couldn't be any more obnoxious, the title of this track is ""We Are the Niggers of the World"".
    </p>
<p>
    More so than the album's overall malaise and inconsistency, it's this ridiculous (and in some cases, offensive) attempt at ""edginess"" that's most off-putting. Stunts like naming the album's first track ""Bring Me the Head of Paul McCartney on Heather Mills' Wooden Peg (Dropping Bombs on the White House)"", or calling one of <em>Underground</em>'s high points ""Automatic Faggot for the People"" are the sort of look-at-me tactics that one would hope would be beneath a 40-year-old. They're also better reserved for music that doesn't sound like canon-beholden <em>Mojo</em> bait.  Watching the videos Newcombe and friends posted to YouTube to accompany a leak of <em>Underground</em> tracks near the end of 2007-- Newcombe spray-painting corny epithets on hallways, Newcombe wrecking and burning all sorts of crap in a forced pique of Keith Moonian splendor, Newcombe getting the word ISLAND tattooed inside his lower lip-- only exacerbates how silly and self-indulgent his half-assed attempts at artistic martyrdom are, and have been.  The myth of the Brian Jonestown Massacre--  a construct that holds weight only with the hopelessly converted-- has always superseded and surpassed the actual work of the Brian Jonestown Massacre.  Even now, when that myth is but a shadow of its former glory, that still holds true.

Goode: His Complete '50s Chess Recordings|5674.0|Chuck Berry|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Universal', 'Hip-O Select']|2008-05-08 00:00:00|2008|2016-06-11 19:25:45.716258|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".cyi2g8xudc.1.6:0.1.0.$11257/=1$11257.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Chuck Berry didn't invent rock and roll, but he may very well have invented rock'n'roll. His songs fueled and inspired the likes of Buddy Holly, the Beach Boys, the Beatles, the Who, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, and just about anybody in his wake who picked up an electric guitar. In the invaluable rock doc <em>Hail! Hail! Rock'n'Roll</em>, we watch in awe has Berry puts Keith Richards in his place with just a single angry glare, and watch in double-awe as Richards takes it. After all, the Stones guitarist, like countless other musicians of his generation, knows he owes virtually everything to Berry, and has admitted as much, so he gives deference where deference is due.</p><p>
    Berry's as worthy of hagiography as any rock legend, but he's not yet ready for a eulogy. In fact, Berry's 50-plus year career has been marked by one constant-- forward motion. Indeed, Berry's far too stubborn a man to ever give inertia the chance to slow him down, and he still spends a considerable amount of time on stage for an octogenarian. As far as the studio goes, however, Berry hasn't released a new album since 1979, and even then his songwriting had been in steady decline since the early 60s. His last (and sole number one!) hit, a live version of the juvenile novelty ""My Ding-a-Ling"", was released in 1972.</p><p>
    One perverse but still appropriate way to view Berry's erratic (or non-existent) output over the past three or so decades is as further validation of the enduring strength of the first decade of his recording career, especially the productive, world-changing last five years of the 1950s collected on the self-explanatory <em>Johnny B. Goode: His Complete '50s Chess Recordings</em>. It was on Chicago's Chess imprint that Berry would change the blueprint of popular music, and it's on this 4xCD collection that we can revisit the fruits of his labor.</p><p>
    Of course, Berry's singles are such a firm part of the pop lexicon that one may feel they don't need revisiting in 2008. Yet it's still both useful and enjoyable to blast tracks like ""Maybellene"", ""Sweet Little Sixteen"", ""Johnny B. Goode"", ""Carol"",
    ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"", ""Roll Over Beethoven"", ""Too Much Monkey Business"", ""School Day (Ring! Ring! Goes the Bell)"", ""Rock and Roll Music"", ""Memphis Tennessee"", ""Little Queenie"", ""Run Rudolph Run"", or ""Back in the U.S.A."" and, if only for each of their two or three minutes, a least pretend that you've never heard them before. Put yourself in the shoes of some kid stumbling across them on the radio before bedtime: How could you not buy a guitar and follow suit?</p><p>
    But while <em>His Complete '50s Chess Recordings</em> contains the bulk of Berry's greatest hits, it's also, well, complete, which means some less than epochal songs are there to for career context (hell, even a couple of the singles, like 1956's hokey pidgin English ""Havana Moon"", don't show Berry at his most formidable). The collection is also not exactly complete, which is fine, as far the set's listenability. The liners note, for example, 13 existing takes of ""Sweet Little Sixteen"", but it's probably best to accept the compilers judgment when they only include five of them. In fact, beyond the obvious singles and hits, it's in the alternate versions of several very well known songs-- demos, aborted takes and the like-- that this set may be most fascinating. According to the notes, several reels of unmarked or anonymously dated tapes (with names like ""Long Fast Jam, Long Slow Jam 9/58"") often disguised hidden treats providing clues to some ongoing puzzles (such as the participation of piano player Johnnie Johnson, whom many cite-- and Johnson attempted to litigate-- as one major source of Berry's sound).</p><p>
    ""Reelin' and Rockin'"" didn't get it totally right until take 10, but here we can hear take one and tell for ourselves why that one and the other nine takes didn't make the cut. We hear the 2nd take of ""Johnny B. Goode"" aborted by Berry, who bitches about the piano sounding too much like ""Roll Over Beethoven""-- ""stay away from that"", he snaps, before kicking right into take three (which sounds pretty damned good). </p><p>
    So the question remains: Did he know? Did Berry know not just the difference between the right take and the wrong take, but that the right takes were writing the rules of rock, laying down the template for so many to follow? Considering Berry's ego is part of the public record, one presumes the man himself would say ""yes"" without blinking. But even if you didn't believe him, or trust his perspective, the music here really does speak for itself. It's an equation proven sound again and again: Quantity plus quality equals immortality. <br/></p></div>"|11257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11257-johnny-b-goode-his-complete-50s-chess-recordings/|9.5|Joshua Klein

But is Walker breathing fire, or is this proverbial ""Technicolor yawn"" in full effect? Walker likely intended the former, but the latter is more apt. After all, <em>Laughter's an Asshole/Lion Land</em> is spread out over two sprawling discs, not as a double but as two albums for the price of one. Yes, Walker's amassed so much music he's basically giving it away-- at least until Walker accumulates still more music to stuff on the next release. That shouldn't be a problem, since listening to these discs it's clear that everything must come out, like a big, messy, cleansing, gut-clearing barf.  You think Devendra Banhart is all Id? You ain't heard nothing yet.</p><p>
    And yet Walker's over-the-top approach-- massed vocals, kitchen sink instrumentation-- adequately, even impressively disguises the dearth of actual songs. ""Bing Bang Boom"", for example, is an ace approximation of Tropicalia, but it's still really just an exercise. Similarly, ""Baby Neon"", ""Up Here the Air Is Fresh and Sweet"", and ""At the Party, in the Woods"" are wacky, whacked-out helium voiced indulgences; the rest of the disc is alternately beautiful, silly, fantastic, goofy, and wonderful mood pieces akin to the Animal Collective axis. It's all so unpredictable, so inherently whimsical, colorful and kaleidoscopic, that it's practically psychedelic by default. The lack of focus is the focus, and on those paradoxical terms it's a pretty wild and wooly success.</p><p>
    That's <em>Laughter's an Asshole</em>, at least. <em>Lion Land</em> is even more homebrew, the kind of catchall that DIY allows and encourages. It makes room for Ween-y ballads like ""Save Your Love For Me""  and the dreamy pop collision ""Heaven With You Tonight"", for the 1960s-styled bad trip freakout of ""Through the Skull of a Goat"" and the symphonic synths of ""Let Freedom Ring"", and for the harmony-rich, bigger than the Beach Boys swoon of ""Warm in the Sun/Worn in the Sun"". Whether there's room, or even a need, for all these ideas, all at once, is another matter. These tracks were recorded by Walker, mostly alone, in his bedroom, two years ago, and only recently got issued as this 2xCD trove of a debut. In retrospect, it sounds a little ahead of the curve, or at least perfectly in tune with passing trends. But it also sounds awfully  familiar in light of all the likeminded acts proliferating as of late. If an album is novel and original much the same way another album is novel and original, does that mean the album's not really novel and original? Maybe it's best to just follow Walker's example and blaze blindly straight ahead, head held high. Not all winners come in first. <br/></p></div>"|11678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11678-laughters-an-assholelion-land/|7.3|Joshua Klein

    Originally a Japan-only release, <em>Films</em>, Sonic Sum's follow-up to their 2000 debut <em>Sanity Annex</em>, has been unavailable on these shores for the past four years. It's not hard to see why. Rob Sonic, Def Jux solo artist and the sole MC between Sonic Sum's three globe-scattered producers, works in note-card lyricism, avoiding things like breath control, fluid enjambment, or narrative. Examples from <em>Films</em> of his evacuated line breaks, grating twenty-dollar flourishes of polysyllabic, Latinate words, and asinine emphatics (""UN-inter-EST/ Ready to AD-minister RE-flex, HA-mmer, WA-ter drips"") could fill double-wide Moleskine.</p><p>
    Subject matter is non-existent. That's an intentional move, of course, giving Sonic carte blanche to splatter ""underground"" tropes of programming, city-as-<em>The-Matrix</em> malaise, romantic disappointment dressed up as city-as-<em>The-Matrix</em> malaise (""Emergency!/ Override!/ Won't confide in you!"" from ""Negatives""), and, of course, people who just don't get it. And if the box for style, poetics, and form goes unchecked, the same vacancy, sadly, would have to appear in the every-sticky space known as persona. Sonic so clearly sounds a graduate of the Aesop Rock school of monotone-as-solemnity. When he ejects monosyllabic imperative nuggets-- ""Dislodge/ Distill/ Quit job/ Sit still"" (from ""Choking Victim"")-- there's no shift in timbre or exigency. This is rap as summary.</p><p>
    Though there is a more than enough sin in the melodies of <em>Films</em> (patchouli-scented, ambling guitar riffs and glib ""vintage"" news reel dialog samples are the nastiest sonic refrains), the album has a few effective Def Jux melodies. ""Rocket"" has an eventide of misty snares rising over shadowy synths; there's a surprisingly bedroom-ready sitar and slick bell section duel on the title track. 
    </p>
<p>
    The problem is that the other three producers besides Sonic-- Fred Ones, Preservation, and Eric M.O.-- never stray to far from dirgy, mid-tempo ""burners."" Their missteps interlock: Fred Ones' ""Films"" is a series of rusted guitar loops over a series of synthpop basslines.  Eric M.O. tries to bliss out his hi-hats so much they smear in to nothingness under night-sky synths. The melodies, like the lyrics, shovel and crowd instead of shaping and deliniating. The beat guys get to at least share the blame.
    </p>
<p>
    Taking Rob Sonic and <em>Films</em> to task isn't fun. In every interview, and even on the fleetingly passable moments here, Sonic comes across as the type of MC you'd like to see succeed: He knows where he comes from (the D.C. 'burbs, for the record), he confesses his influences and musical loves, and he's appropriately wary about hip-hop's perceived disconnect with a common reality. But desire and ambient political awareness do not a microphone controller make. As he's busy defining and decrying the other MCs, contradicting his own proletariat love (""Who complains more than the basic/ Complacent/ Patience""), Sonic perhaps gets closer the mirror than he'd like, ""Me sitting cramped, flanked by my/ Forget it/ Reminding you of how much better someone else said it.""

As Santogold, White is putting her knowledge of star quality into practical effect. At its best, her album's cross-genre confidence is dazzling, combining dub, new wave, and hip-hop to create some of the year's freshest pop. At its worst, it feels annoyingly overthought.</p><p>
    The central questions of Santogold's first single, ""Creator"" (who's real and who's fake?), seem to nag at her, but its stunning follow-up, ""L.E.S. Artistes"", returns to the topic of creativity, hype, and integrity, with the singer sinking her teeth into Lower East Side poseurs and wannabes. White's also walking a line herself: She's a professional songwriter, and talked to the BBC earlier this year about writing for Ashlee Simpson. ""It's like two different hats that I have to wear. It's like the difference between writing fiction and writing ad copy. It's like a formula versus your art.""</p><p>
    That's fair enough. It's not unlike the age-old compromise of film directors-- a movie for the studio, and a movie for me. The problem is that when you compartmentalize formula and art, you risk creating a formula <em>for</em> your art, defining it by what it isn't rather than what it is. <em>Santogold</em>'s second half seems to fall into this trap, with a series of tepid dub-influenced tracks that kick her obvious pop gifts-- melody, hooks, and bounce-- to the curb. On ""Anne"", the usually fiery White sounds muted and apathetic; ""Starstruck"" is a patience-eroding mess of keyboard fuzz; and the grating ""Unstoppable"" feels like being lectured by a parrot.</p><p>
    ""Unstoppable"" is also the track which sounds closest to White's friend and collaborator M.I.A. Hers is the name you'll think of first when you hear Santogold: They share co-producers Diplo and Switch, as well as a taste for bass and a forthright vocal style. The more you listen, though, the shallower the resemblance seems: Santi White can do M.I.A.'s tongue-swallowing bark if she wants to, but she's just as comfortable with the gentler registers her melodies require. And while M.I.A. uses global club music to project a future pop blueprint, Santogold explores how they integrate with renegade music of the past.</p><p>
    For much of <em>Santogold</em>, White is channeling and recombining a series of indie icons: Debbie Harry, Kim Deal, Ari Up, Joe Strummer, and Karen O. On ""My Superman"" she captures the imperious swoop of Siouxsie Sioux and drapes it over the kind of stern electro Goldfrapp used to make. ""I'm a Lady"" marries ska-pop verses to a strutting Elastica chorus. ""Lights Out"" finds a fascinating middle ground between the Pixies and the Go-Go's.</p><p>
    This could turn the record into a spot-the-reference game, but White glues it together first with the backing harmonies she uses to sweeten most tracks, and second with her love of space and echo. The early 1980s fascinate her, and I'd guess a big part of why has to do with the era's cross-breeding of rock, punk, and reggae. A trio of songs-- ""You'll Find a Way"", ""Shove It"", and ""Say Aha""-- evoke that moment when rock's aggression met reggae's drive and depth, and it makes for <em>Santogold</em>'s most thrilling sequence. ""Say Aha"" in particular is perfect new wave bubblegum-- 2 Tone keyboards, phaser effects, a stomp-ready chorus, and a surf guitar solo to finish. As if to ward off accusations of revivalism, it leads into ""Creator"", a grimy arcade funk jam that's Santogold's heaviest and most successful electronic move.</p><p>
    ""Creator"" has already soundtracked more than one commercial, and if ""L.E.S. Artistes"", Santogold's best song, gets similar exposure it could be inescapable. It already sounds huge, with its soaring chorus that should resonate with anyone facing change: ""I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up."" In Santi White's case ""it"" is stardom, and ""L.E.S. Artistes"" might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The irony of this song about compromise is that, like the other great tracks on <em>Santogold</em>, it shows exactly why she's in demand with Ashlee or Lily Allen: She's a consummate pop songwriter. Santogold might try to separate formula and art, but her album catches fire when she blasts that distinction into irrelevance.</p></div>"|11483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11483-santogold/|7.1|Tom Ewing

At the time, with solo careers embarked upon and new collaborators recruited, few expected the pair to reconvene as the Go-Betweens, which they eventually did roughly 10 years later. With the untimely 2006 death of McLennan came a sickening feeling of permanence, however; the excellent <em>Oceans Apart</em> would serve as the Go-Betweens' true swan song. Making the loss of McLennan all the more painful was <a href=""http://www.themonthly.com.au/tm/node/246"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Forster's reminiscence in Australia's <em>The Monthly</em></strong></a> (for whom Forster has become a cultural critic), that ""we were on the cusp of something,"" and that ""album number 10 was going to be something special.""</p><p>
    It's impossible to listen to Forster's <em>The Evangelist</em> without thinking of McLennan, but to his credit Forster has designed it that way. Three songs were in fact co-written with McLennan, bequeathed to Forster to reveal to the world and break our hearts all over again. ""Demon Days"" in particular works eerily like a self-penned eulogy, something that Forster was quite aware of: ""I played it a couple of days after he died,"" recalled Forster in a recent interview in <em>The Age</em>, ""and it was an extraordinary moment because I was the only other person who knew this song existed and I've got this thing, this masterpiece, which is so fragile, because if I'd died three days after him, the song wouldn't exist."" It's a tough listen made all the more touching with the brief appearance of a muted chorus and a swooning string arrangement courtesy of Audrey Riley (who handled the same duties on <em>Liberty Belle &amp; the Black Diamond Express</em>). It's also another indiciation, if another were needed, of the brilliance of the Forster/McLennan team.</p><p>
    It's similarly easy to imagine McLennan, not Forster, leading ""Let Your Light In, Babe"" and ""It Ain't Easy"", two more songs salvaged from the songwriter's works in progress notebook, and it's no surprise that his shadow spreads across much of the rest of <em>The Evangelist</em> as well. Forster, even though he occasionally collaborated directly with McLennan, is nonetheless a very different singer and songwriter, and his solo albums never hit the highs of McLennan's. Even here, after every great song like ""If It Rains"", ""Pandanus"", or the elegiac album-closing tearjerker ""From Ghost Town"", your mind is primed for McLennan's counterpart response. Aside from the aforementioned songs, they never come, of course, which partly explains why <em>The Evangelist</em> feels a little incomplete. It's not fair to Forster, of course, who rose to the occasion with his warmest and most welcoming solo album. But even beyond the imherant emotional baggage, songs such as ""Did She Overtake You"" or the slightly bombastic ""Don't Touch Anything"" still sound like they could have used a pass through someone else's filter. </p><p>
    Yet if anything the album's slight flaws work as sideways tribute to Forster's late friend and partner. ""Something's not right, something's gone wrong,"" sings Forster, channeling McLennan, in ""Demon Days"". If anything's wrong with <em>The Evangelist</em>, it's not a problem that can be fixed.  It's wrong like an empty chair at a banquet, unopened presents at a birthday party, a pile of uncollected mail on the front steps, or an unfinished novel that trails off into who knows where. It's wrong like even our fondest memories, cursed to fade with time. <br/></p></div>"|11470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11470-the-evangelist/|7.6|Joshua Klein

    On the surface, this compilation is intended to be a broad rundown of a specific studio's output-- that of Compass Point, the Bahamian outpost established by Island Records founder Chris Blackwell and manned by a who's who of reggae session players including the ace production team/rhythm section of Sly &amp; Robbie. But it might as well be a symposium on the polyglot tendencies that made the dance underground of the first half of the 1980s so unpredictably rich in ideas. Name a genre that either established itself or peaked in the late 70s or early 80s-- electro-funk, disco, reggae, dub, post-punk, old-school hip-hop-- and it's represented in the music on this compilation, rarely without being comfortably fused to another genre to spectacular effect.</p><p>
    The most well-known cuts on <em>Funky Nassau: The Compass Point Story 1980-1986</em> might as well be shorthand for this type of fusion-- Tom Tom Club's chirpy, blissed-out Caribbean/new wave/rap pastiche ""Genius of Love"", Talking Heads' jittery Afrobeat-inflected digital rave-up ""Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)"", and an extended version of Ian Dury's BBC-banned ""Spasticus Autisticus"", which retorted to Britain's patronizing declaration of 1981 as ""Year of the Disabled"" with <em>Spartacus</em>-lifted shouts of solidarity, bitingly arch lyrics (""So place your hard-earned peanuts in my tin/ And thank the creator you're not in the state I'm in"") and a vertigo-inducing bass/synth interplay. There's just one baffling decision in the famous names department-- instead of something from the superb <em>Nightclubbing</em>, Grace Jones' tenure at Compass Point is represented by the digital reggae of ""My Jamaican Guy"", and the combination of her flat singing and the gradual tedium of its seven-minute extended mix makes for an unexciting way to open the compilation.</p><p>
    But <em>Funky Nassau</em> gets better in a hurry, thanks not just to the usual post-punk suspects but also due to the fringe artists, obscurities, and ostensible novelty records (emphasis on novel) that fill out the bulk of the collection. There are two tracks that, thanks largely to house music pioneer François Kevorkian, prove to be the collection's most surprising highlights. Cuban-born Guy Cuevas' 1982 France-exclusive ""Obsession"" piles glimmering keyboards on top of a Bernard Edwards-caliber bassline and comes up with a late-disco gem that sounds triangulated between Havana, Paris, and NYC. And the Kevorkian mix of ""Dance Sucker"", the 1983 debut single from Scottish obscurities Set the Tone, sounds like a uprocker's take on a circa-1988 Nine Inch Nails demo, with a lead singer belting out sneering Reznor-isms (and the occasional Nic Offer-ism) over a packed wall of electro.
    </p>
<p>
    Where most of the tracks on <em>Funky Nassau</em> breathe free with loose-jointed smoothness, disco deconstructionist Cristina's ""You Rented a Space"" is a claustrophobic slab of electronic dub where the percolating bass and the staggering but sure-footed rhythms practically corner you in a hallway and breathe down your neck. (Cristina's decadently sly voice knows better, and aims directly at your inner ear: ""Your lovin' is as cold as the cold clasp of death."") And then there's Bits &amp; Pieces-- basically Sly &amp; Robbie working under an alias- - cranking out a playful but heavy cover of Yarbrough &amp; Peoples' 1980 hit ""Don't Stop the Music"", replicating its fuzzed-out synth-funk faithfully but throwing in a subtle reggae backbeat and, for kicks, a few likeably daft rap lyrics about hairstyles. The Compass Point sound proved that the sound of the Caribbean could cover just about anywhere-- and, at the same time, helped create music that couldn't have come from anywhere else.

    Tickley Feather's debut long-player opens with a small child's voice drawling, somewhat disconcertingly, ""I've got magic inside my bones somewhere."" Similar spoken snippets are scattered throughout the record, each centering around the words ""bones"" or ""magic,"" or both. Clearly the repetition is intentional and well-considered, as you'd be hard-pressed to come up with two terms that better convey the essence of a skeletally lo-fi album that pulls its bliss from such improbable places.</p><p>
    The brainchild of Philadelphia resident Annie Sachs, Tickley Feather's scratchy bedroom probings slot nicely next to fellow Paw Tracks alum Ariel Pink, yet (as is the case with Pink), she's not nearly as musically dynamic or engaging as the kingpins of her loose coterie, Animal Collective. The song title ""Keyboards Is Drunk"" is a succinct summation of Sachs' approach (she's clearly quite fond of straightforward nomenclature-- see also titles like ""Rain Bucket"" and ""Leaking Roof""), as she utilizes wobbly, simplistic key patterns and layers them with largely indecipherable singsong melodies or chirpy yells, occasionally a low-rent drum track, and other sonic detritus. This is the kind of record where hiss, feedback, and even the abstract concepts of cheapness and obfuscation are more or less instruments as well, coloring and shaping what we hear, burying certain motifs while embellishing others.</p><p>
    Given her deliberately limited palette, it makes sense that Sachs' tracks would start to sound a bit same-y, with their abbreviated running times admittedly a saving grace, as even three and a half minutes of ""Night Train"" interminably attests. Still, there are plenty of standouts here, haunting or earworm-ish moments like the ""tra la la""s of ""Le Daylight"" or the relatively long, smudgy vocal lines that sprout into melodies on ""The Python"" and ""Night Chant"". As you'd expect, even minor departures from the blueprint stand out, with magnified thrills arising from the booming ""Psycho Killer"" bass of ""Sorry Party"" and the harsher electro edge of ""Tonight Is the Nite"" (both of which also find Sachs yelling more than usual). As a standalone artifact <em>Tickley Feather</em> has plenty of charm, yielding something furtive but friendly for those who penetrate its mountains of artlessness and hiss. However, the jury's still out on whether there's enough here to build a sustainable and rewarding aesthetic.

    At first glance, Orion Rigel Dommisse's debut <em>What I Want From You Is Sweet</em>
    sounds like the output of another fanciful bard in the Joanna Newsom
    mold: electric cello player singing narrative set pieces about twin
    girls telling ghost stories, hushed conclusions about the flesh (""The
    body is a breathing thing/ I'd like to keep it warm"") under sweeping
    strings courtesy of Espers star and album producer Greg Weeks. It's
    even on a cozy imprint (Language of Stone) of Newsom's home label Drag
    City.</p><p>
    But something dark and serrated is hidden among all those would-be
    costume folds. Upper register vocals and manicured strings and
    Wurlitzer aside, this album is ten songs (a taut 38 minutes)
    of sylvan murder ballads, equal parts Nick Cave fatalism and
    delusional, pastoral noir. Look no further than the ominous, grayscale cover art: a grove gone to seed; sinister, overfed goats circling
    a well in the foreground; a black growth bulging from a tree; a young
    woman walking a path to a beat-up trailer tilting in the background.</p><p>
    The album opens with a song called ""Fake Yer Death"" and a line of grim prescription-- ""Fake your death/ If
    you need to""-- which unfolds into the macabre instructional (""Make sure the
    bones look something like your own""). Then a haunting narrative about two
    questionable young girls (Ghosts? Murderers?) luring a man to his death
    in the ocean set above a nodding Omnichord waltz (""Alice and Sarah"").
    Then, on ""Simon Sent For Me"", 8-bit piano twinkles and another string of
    troubling imperatives: ""Get out of the ocean/ Get into the cave/ Don't
    drink from haunted fountains/ Stop rubbing graves."" Message: received.
    </p>
<p>
    As a vocalist, Dommisse stays guile. She's extremely choosy about how
    and where she articulates her lines. On ""Suicide Kiss (Because Dead)"",
    she buries each line's first half, smothering words under rising tidal
    strings and ambient buzz that the listener can only retrieve single
    images and phrases until the hook, ""Because death, because death/ Will
    open my heart,"" intercedes. Death holds court on <em>Sweet</em>. It's the featured word in four
    of the album's ten song titles. And it's the revisited, reexamined
    subject of pretty much every line and sentiment on the album. Even when
    Dommisse trots out an uptempo, nearly-major-chord song (""Capricorn""),
    she uses it to link her speaker with the astrological goat-- a
    traditional symbol of, among other things, lechery, winter, formality,
    and darkness.
    </p>
<p>
    Dommisse keeps the darkness relatively compelling. As the Plath-like obsessions veer into monochrome, the sounds of <em>Sweet</em>
    become, consciously or unconsciously, an attempt to balance the
    pervading shade of the album. Her cello feels wedded to her murky
    lyricism, so it's the troika of Dommisse's electric piano, Omnichord,
    and Wurlitzer that anchor the lighter, almost fanciful electronic
    backgrounds (her MySpace page playfully has Legend of Zelda as one of her
    influences). This is a tricky balancing act, and <em>Sweet</em> does a fine job
    keeping its sharpness and its hidden, er, sweetness, in dialogue.
    Nearly 40 minutes of a gloomy wood nymph debut is as much as any
    sane listener can handle, but it speaks well of the album that after
    all those fatal lessons and imperatives, there are still some very real
    questions left over. Namely, what stories does Dommisse have left to
    tell? And how many people are going to die?

While <em>Prospect</em> sounded terrific from the start, 2006's <em>People</em>, which followed <em>Feels</em>, felt more like what it was-- a chance to release a few not-quite-as-good songs out that didn't make the cut. Now comes the <em>Water Curses</em> EP, which contains three tracks from the <em>Strawberry Jam</em> sessions and another recorded at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room studio.</p><p>
    The opening title track ranks among the best songs the band has written in purely pop terms, alongside ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"", ""Grass"", and ""Fireworks"". The production is busy with snippets of what could be a gurgling bong, creaking floorboards, and laser-like effects, but it's mixed beautifully and remains light on the ears despite its density. With its de-emphasis on identifiable instrumentation (guitars are there, but they're way down in the mix), ""Water Curses"" seems unbound by genre or era, and serves as a nice reminder of how many risks Animal Collective is taking sonically these days. It's mostly electronic and it's pop, but it doesn't have anything to do with the 1980s, which in itself makes it unusual; it sounds like something no other band working right now could have made.</p><p>
    Among the other three tracks, nothing else is nearly so direct melodically. ""Street Flash"", which has been a staple of live sets for a while now, begins slow with dubbed-out scraping noises and distant samples of loud vocalizations. The opening section is pure mood, as Avey Tare sings in his lower register to assorted sounds placed against a wide backdrop of silence, but then his voice is subjected to an underwater effect, some gentle piano enters, and things grow progressively thicker. The baby-like screams that he alternates with sweet crooning aren't going to win the band any new fans (they feel somewhat out of place in this more subtle track), but it's still an effective slice of ambience.
    </p><p>
    ""Cobwebs"" is like a mid-tempo and more song-like variation on some of ""Street Flash""'s ideas; where the latter gets by on impressionistic drift, ""Cobwebs"" is like a slow march through a bucolic landscape, the clackity and deliberate percussion occasionally giving into a surging chorus. There's again plenty of intriguing sonic detail, and the track sounds especially good on headphones; with its bright, tactile production, the whole record is very visual, sometimes feeling like  a series of weird scenes glimpsed through the glass of an aquarium.  The aquatic motif returns on record closer ""Seal Eyeing"", which is anchored by a few notes of melancholy piano, and nicely wraps up some of the production ideas as they fold in the sound of the traditional instrument on a pretty, evocative ballad while maintaining an air of strangeness. 
    </p>
<p>
    Though ostensibly a collection of outtakes, <em>Water Curses</em> feels like its own thing, with a consistent mood and an identifiable palette. The record also finds the band becoming increasingly comfortable with integrating unusual sounds and textures into their music. Where they once used synths, delay pedals, and crude electronic percussion in an abstract, noise-oriented ways, they're now discovering how to make odd sounds work with proper songs. You can hear them becoming more experimental and more accessible simultaneously. While <em>Water Curses</em> is plenty enjoyable on its own, it also sets you dreaming about where Animal Collective will go next.

It's gotten so bad that, in 2008, yammering on about the cliché of dubbing someone ""the next Dylan"" has become a cliché in itself. Still: It's exceptionally hard to talk about Scandinavian folksinger the Tallest Man on Earth (also known as Kristian Matsson) without mentioning Bob Dylan's early years, mostly because Matsson manages to embody Dylan's effortlessness so well (Dylan was trying really, really hard, sure-- but he sang like he didn't give a shit), infusing his songs with a detachment that, miraculously, is neither cold nor alienating. Like Dylan, Matsson is so natural a songwriter that these tracks feel predetermined, tumbling out of his mouth with an ease and grace that's increasingly uncommon.  <br/> <br/> Matsson released a self-titled five-song EP in 2007; <em>Shallow Grave</em> is his full-length debut.  The production is appropriately scrappy, and it seems relatively safe to assume that the album was recorded live with one microphone-- accordingly, we hear the scratch of fingernails on string (and, on occasion, the chirping of birds in the background), made privy to each tiny exhalation and sigh. Matsson is an adept fingerpicker, and his guitar is easily as central as his voice, which is high, crackling, and rich. Much like Dylan himself, Matsson has mined the American south for inspiration, and his frantic strumming and front-porch poetry recall everyone from the Carter Family to Lead Belly to, most noticeably, country bluesman Mississippi John Hurt.  <br/> <br/> ""The Blizzard's Never Seen the Desert Sands"" sees Matsson caw little poems (""And the bells up in the tower they will ring/ And the frightened little choirs they will sing/ They will tremble, all their voices"") over plucked banjo; ""The Gardener"" features a robustly strummed guitar melody and more half-cogent ideas (""I know the runner's gonna tell you/ There ain't no cowboy in my hair/ So now he's buried by the daisies/ So I can stay the tallest man in your eyes, babe""). Matsson's lyrics don't stand up as well on paper as they do in song (some have all the logic of fairy tales), but each of these cuts has a distinct, if muddled, narrative-- sparrows, tranquilizer guns, curtains, unicorns. Road stories, love stories, prayers. <br/> <br/> Matsson's melodies are remarkably pliant, and while it's understandable to be skeptical of another skinny dude with a mustache, a guitar, and a worn-out copy of <em>The Anthology of American Folk Music</em>, the more time you invest in <em>Shallow Grave</em>, the more you'll realize how unusually memorable it is. Ultimately, <em>Shallow Grave</em> transcends comparison-- which is saying an awful lot, given the popularity of its prototype-- and Matsson is a natural-born folksinger, earnest, clever, and comforting.</p></div>"|11359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11359-shallow-graves/|8.3|Amanda Petrusich

    The music of the Sun City Girls (1981-2007) was a heady, diverse and
    lovingly fucked-up mixture of arcane musical styles. These trixters
    presaged entire genres before they existed. Their gamut swung from
    improv to cowboy ballads, South American folk songs to Asian drone
    music, crazy lounge songs to creepy classic rock, spaced-out jams to
    prank-ish punk. They were what happens when the melting pot explodes,
    miscegenation in every dimension. If that line sounds way too much like
    the voice-over from the trailer to a bad 1960s movie, all the better, as
    kitsch was among the more sharply burnished implements in their
    arsenal. Acts as diverse as Sunburned Hand of the Man, Thinking
    Fellers, Dengue Fever, Six Organs of Admittance, Camper van Beethoven,
    and Les Georges Leningrad owe more than a little to their
    margin-walking legacy.</p><p>
    Each of their 80-or-so releases (including cassettes, LPs, CDs,
    singles, and one 10"" 78) was different, at times markedly so. There were
    no safety nets at their incredible performances. They often antagonized
    and taunted audiences-- in truth, they trusted the audience greatly, so
    much that they were never willing to pander in any way. Everything was
    done in their own idiosyncratic fashion. The band was largely ignored
    by critics. They occasionally received glowing reviews, notably from <em>The Wire</em>
    (from Ian Christe in 1995 and Erik Davis in 2004). Of course, it didn't
    help that the Girls rarely sent out promo copies, toured only
    sporadically, and released too many records at one time.</p><p>
    Another reason the Girls were ""unsuccessful"" in terms of a career in
    underground rock is that they ignored the clamor to make more records
    like <em>Torch of the Mystics</em> (Majora, 1990). <em>Torch</em>
    is the thorny behemoth of the SCG discography. Otherworldly and
    melodic, it's undeniably among their best albums (and one of the ten
    best records of the 1980s, in my opinion). But the Girls made a dozen or two
    others that were of equal quality; they were simply more challenging
    listens. In time, the band would grow to dislike the record, and
    audience members' repeated suggestions to play songs from it would
    often be met with contemptuous stares and nicotine-fueled rants.
    </p>
<p>
    The first release on the Sun City Girls' own Abduction imprint since
    the group disbanded at the start of 2007 following the untimely death
    of unhinged and brilliant percussionist/raconteur Charles Gocher is a
    wonderful visit to the group's archives. Named for a 7"" single of the
    same name, <em>You're Never Alone with a Cigarette </em>is
    a snapshot of the group in the late 1980s, right when they were
    reaching the peak of their powers. Six of the album's nine tracks were
    released on 7""s
    in the early 90s that you'd have to be some combination of lucky, old,
    and rich to already possess. And though the disc is on the short side
    at just under 40 minutes, the three previously unreleased tracks-- plus
    the
    expansion of ""The Fine-Tuned Machines of Lemuria"" from five to twelve
    minutes-- are sweet enough that SCG obsessives will be obliged to pick
    a copy. I should mention that longtime cohort Scott
    Colburn's remastering is astounding.
    </p>
<p>
    Recorded in July 1988 at the same sessions as <em>Torch of the Mystics</em>, these predominantly instrumental surf, raga, free jazz, rock, and uncategorizable numbers were originally meant to round <em>Torch</em>
    out into a double album. Due to one label (Placebo) collapsing and the
    second label (Majora)'s lack of funds, that version never materialized,
    which is a real shame. It would have shown more of the group's full
    breadth, from the pretty, ""pan-Asian"" songs of <em>Torch</em> to the
    thorny, ragged post-psychedelia on display here. Word is that there are
    plans for this to be released on vinyl sometime soon. Perhaps it could
    include the long out-of-print <em>Torch</em> material as well-- pretty please, with one hundred pounds of black olives on top?

    As yet another pop scion, Moreno Veloso's tread rather carefully on the coattails of his father Caetano. Veloso waited until just shy of his 30th birthday to release his debut <em>Music Typewriter</em>, and even then the 2000 disc was credited, modestly, to Moreno +2-- the ""+2"" of the equation being collaborators Alexandre Kassin and Domenico Lancelotti. In fact, espousing a sort of rotating auteur theory, the three have gone on to collaborate two more times, with each taking a turn as leader. <em>Sincerely Hot</em>, credited to Domenico +2, arrived in 2004, and now, following a protracted wait while U.S. label Luaka Bop searched for a distributor, comes <em>Futurismo</em>, credited to Kassin +2.</p><p>
    Veloso, Lancelotti, and Kassin are all versatile multi-instrumentalists, and their respective roles change from disc to disc. Further belying any cries of ego, Veloso first ceded vocal duties to Domenico, and here, on the third volume of their collaborations, Veloso and Domenico largely let Kassin take the mic. The fact that each iteration of the band features the same performers but slightly different sounds is a credit to the group's collective creative vision, with each album offering a slightly different take on 21st century samba and bossa nova.</p><p>
    No, this isn't your father's Brazilian pop, not even if your father is the famously freewheeling Caetano Veloso. In fact, even more than Moreno, Kassin has been around, working with everyone from Bebel Gilberto to Marisa Monte to Arto Lindsay, and appearing with what seems like about half of Brazil's musical community (his ""+2"" compatriots among them) in the supergroup Orquestra Imperial. Maybe those experiences explain why, despite the success of the Moreno and Domenico discs, Kassin's turn is nonetheless the strongest of the bunch. Then again, given that the group originally envisioned these albums (logically) as a trilogy, maybe Veloso, Lancelotti, and Kassin were just building up to <em>Futurismo</em> all along.
    </p>
<p>
    With <em>Futurismo</em>, the gentler acoustic sounds of Moreno's disc and the slightly more electronic leaning experiments of Domenico meet in a completely entrancing middle. Not middle of the road, mind, but middle as in mesh, a mix of both extremes: traditional and outré, music meant for lounging on the beach, reclining with a drink, hitting the dance floor, and scaring the neighbors all wrapped in one.
    </p>
<p>
    The space sounds and captured transmissions that conclude ""Seu Lugar"" don't knock it off its gentle path, but the jazzy funk of ""Esquecido"" isn't so passive. ""Pra Lembar"" and ""Mensagem"" are retro pop exotica, while ""Ponto Final"" rides a furious groove and menacing guitar riff into Tropicália nirvana. ""Samba Machine"" is a mix of fuzz rock and dance music, giving way to the breezy Afro-Caribbean beats of ""Agua"". ""Simbioticos"" is skittering indie rock.
    </p>
<p>
    Speaking of indie, studio mainstays John McEntire and Sean O'Hagan crop up on <em>Futurismo</em> as well, fitting considering how much those two have borrowed from the MBP scene. Two of those three crossovers, ""Lakeline"" and ""Bow Road"", are sung in English, perhaps out of deference to his additional collaborators, perhaps a sign that Kassin is looking to spread his sonic adventures north of the border.
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, whether chilling out or rocking out, Kassin would likely be welcomed enthusiastically were he to, say, tour North America more regularly, or even make more than the rare scattered appearance outside of Brazil. But as the myriad pleasures of <em>Futurismo</em>, like <em>Sincerely Hot</em> and <em>Music Typewriter</em> before it, demonstrate, what accounts for the appeal of the music is that no matter how far afield Kassin and crew go, it's Brazil and in particular the rhythms of Rio that remain foremost in their hearts. Moving away from those roots may potentially mean even greater fame, but what might get lost are the ineffable charms that draw listeners to gems like <em>Futurismo</em> in the first place.

Like most of today's self-released albums, the best way to access Clear Tigers' first LP is via eMusic and iTunes (and, of course, torrent sites) and fans will know its cover-- if they know it at all-- as an inscrutable 100-pixel square thumbnail. But <em>Brutal</em> may be as good an argument as any for buying the physical artifact, as its uncanny iconography-- a tiger-masked, singlet-wearing, rifle-toting dude astride a white steed against a Photoshopped ocean set-- succinctly sums up its various virtues and demerits. Like its cover art, the album can be dreamlike, thrilling, menacing, and WTF-ludicrous.</p><p>
    Clear Tigers is Brooklynite Nathan Akin, who plays and sings (including some inventive backing vocals) everything. In ""Spookhouse"", a fraught folktronic reminiscence of Halloweens past, Akin chants in a weary, nasal sing-song over soap-bubble synths and torrid piano runs. Leavened with humor, the song nevertheless legitimizes childish anxieties by enumerating actual dangers: mothers ""scared into submission by the razor-blades in apples,"" children carving pumpkins that ""look like sex offenders who live just around the corner,"" and spook houses haunted by every grade school shorty's greatest terror-- teenage bullies. Other tracks, including opener ""Vacation"", which declares (albeit politely) over a throbbing guitar, ""You're not gonna take it/ Gonna start a revolution,"" are as richly informed by a child's hunger for control and personal agency. ""Igloo"", the album's best cut, rubs together shivering electronic and acoustic instruments and shuffles fleeting, fuzzy images to powerfully express that paradoxical feeling of jouissance and powerlessness, the push and pull of wanting to grow up/never grow up.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Akin's childhood source material isn't always so fertile. ""Won't Be Back"" and ""Summer School"" are sludgy grunge slabs that may fill in autobiographical gaps (betcha Akin idled his formative years air-guitar soloing to Mudhoney and the Smashing Pumpkins), but lack the courage of their convictions and come off as smarmy parody. Worse, plunked down next to one another in the center of the album, they KO any momentum and good will earned in the album's otherwise solid first half.
    </p><p>
    Which may be just as well. After this grave error of sequencing, <em>Brutal</em> is basically a compost heap of recycled ideas-- exhausted folk strummers, an Elliott Smith knock-off, and what sounds like an Animal Collective 7"" played at 78. The achy, shimmering ""Deathray"" is the exception, and if you cordon off it and <em>Brutal</em>'s first five tracks, you've got a good EP. Hey, you're downloading this thing anyway-- just order it à la carte.

    It's disingenuous to talk about Los Angeles' <em>New Yorker</em>-profiled, vegan-snacks-serving, book-lending, all-ages venue the Smell with the same high-art vocabulary you'd use to dissect other creative collectives, like Andy Warhol's Factory-- the Smell's constituency (L.A.'s optimistic experimental art pack) appears un-fixated on fame, self-aggrandizement, or furthering its nascent mythology. To an outsider, the Smell is idealistic and romantic, a stroller-friendly, cheap-haircut-hocking haven that's as functional as it is fruitful. Save Baltimore's Wham City, it's been a while since American music fans have had a similar hometown scene to get riled up about; regional culture has been fractured and marginalized by the internet, and being too focused on anything local-- except produce, maybe-- feels depressingly provincial in 2008. Consequently, it's weirdly thrilling that a community-sponsored, community-supported art space can attract (and sustain) such a horde of admirable bands.</p><p>
    No Age, along with Mika Miko, Abe Vigoda, Lavender Diamond, BARR, and a handful of others, are mainstays at the Smell; the cover of No Age's 2007 EP compilation, <em>Weirdo Rippers</em>, famously features the exterior of the club, and guitarist Randy Randall reportedly helped mine trenches in the venue's concrete floor so that a second bathroom could be installed to accommodate new crowds. Given the critical success of <em>Weirdo Rippers</em>, No Age's scope has now expanded well beyond Los Angeles, and <em>Nouns</em>, their first full-length, is appropriately ambitious.</p><p>
    A guitar/drums duo (Randall and drummer/vocalist Dean Spunt) with a penchant for self-recorded samples, No Age are mostly unconcerned with things like space or pause, and <em>Nouns</em> is gorgeously thick-- a hazy, delirious expanse that's both comforting and disorienting. Opener ""Miner"" begins and ends in murk, and in between Randall and Spunt sputter and twitch and pound, alternately revealing and concealing a sweet, taut melody-- such is No Age's agenda, burying an addictive little singalong in layers of effects and fuzz.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Eraser"" is more immediately user-friendly, opening with sunny guitar chirps and a knee-slapping drumbeat, before Spunt starts barking intelligible lyrics (""Wait for the foreman now get paid/ Wait and see the list of shit you made"") and the music goes steady and frantic. ""Eraser"" is a summer song in the sweatiest, most realistic sense-- it's not the Beach Boys' gooey, über-idealized, convertibles-and-beach-volleyball version, it's the waiting-for-the-bus, sweaty and desperate but still-sorta-excited-about-all-that-sunshine take. ""Here Should Be My Home"" is similarly exuberant, full of power chords and distortion; it's arguably the poppiest thing No Age have recorded to date (all those cries of ""baby"" are practically bubblegum), and accordingly, completely addictive. ""Sleeper Hold"", meanwhile, is the sound-- both literally and metaphysically-- of everything happening all at once, an ecstatic, feedback-addled lullaby.</p><p>
    Some fans might pine-- at least at first-- for the (vaguely) more experimental, less riff-driven muck of <em>Weirdo Rippers</em>, but <em>Nouns</em> is a more thoughtful, coherent (and still plenty dirty) version of what No Age began building with all those EPs. Listening to <em>Nouns</em>, it's hard to comprehend how just two people can manage to make so much noise while still sounding so subdued and mysterious-- it's easier to imagine Randall and Spunt spewing these songs underwater, bursting forth from some colossal California quarry rather than a tiny, stuffy art space a few blocks from L.A.'s skid row. <em>Nouns</em> is so cacophonous, so fertile, and so ripe with sound that parsing out the samples and effects and various layers of guitar is nearly impossible; besides, it's way more satisfying to just close your eyes and just enjoy it. Ultimately, it's part of No Age's allure that <em>Nouns</em> is so difficult to figure out, that it manages to be so big while coming from a place so small: All you'll know for sure is that you want to listen longer. Maybe forever.

The fleet finger-picking of ""Shady Grove"", an unaccompanied piece with just Earley and guitar that has opened some of the band's shows, has an accomplished and uncanny twang.

It doesn't take three versions of ""Silver Moon"" to see how the band takes the seeds of Earley's melodies and runs through as many incarnations as they can come up with-- they're all distinctive, but none are quite a moment of epiphany like, say, the version of ""Jericho"" from the band's first Daytrotter session. Even tireless revision doesn't guarantee transcendent results, but it's good to see the band's many rough drafts.

    The first track on 13ghosts' fourth album is called ""The Lonely Death of Space Avenger"", and, true to its title, it's a spare, lonesome space-folktale of an astronaut facing the void-- their own ""Space Oddity"". Death inhabits every corner of <em>The Strangest Colored Lights</em>, investing the Birmingham, Ala., band's pitch-dark songs with a Southern gothic ambience and, somewhat ironically, enlivening the music considerably. It's a very different album from <em>Cicada</em> in 2005, in which they stacked one idea atop another like junk-pile architecture, artfully arranging the raw materials to sound artless-- not composed and recorded, but unearthed in some kudzu gully, carted home, and propped up in the backyard. It's fire-and-brimstone Southern indie, delivered by two gritty singer-songwriters and apparently featuring every musician in Jefferson County. <em>The Strangest Colored Lights</em> lacks its predecessor's compelling chaos, but its songs are slightly more streamlined and fleshed out, their clear beginnings and endings recalling even earlier albums like 2002's <em>Your Window Is Burning</em>.</p><p>
    One half of the songwriting team behind 13ghosts, Brad Armstrong sings like Richard Buckner at a closed-casket viewing and favors intensely Book of Revelations imagery. ""The wind will fall, and the blackbird will dance with the worm,"" he sings on ""Bury Me"" (perhaps an affirmative response to the old hymn ""Oh Bury Me Not""), between blasts of bluesy harmonica. ""The moon will call, and the black snake she swallows the world."" Rarely does indie rock examine decomposition, much less make it seem so mystical, like a new trickster mythology. By contrast, Buzz Russell's drawl sounds slightly more commonplace, although more conspiratorial in its tone, as if he's singing to an audience rather than to the firmament. Against guitars that alternate between dreamy and abrasive, ""Faint Goat"" portrays a high school outsider, a kind of Weird Harold who's good at poetry and ballet, but forgoes sympathy for tauntingly brutal honesty: ""Hey faint goat, where's your nanny now? Were you left here to save the world?""</p><p>
    Together, Armstrong and Russell form a sort of deep-fried Gutter Twins, and their obsession with mortality makes them musically omnivorous, as if they must digest as much as possible in their allotted time on Earth. As a result, 13ghosts continue to reinvent themselves with every song, trying on new sounds and styles to see what fits. Russell's ""Riverside"" rumbles with <em>Carnival of Souls</em> organ, then erupts with funereal horns and Morricone guitar, like Calexico playing a New Orleans funeral. ""Go to Sleep"" trips along on a modified reggae rhythm, while a drum machine cajoles the subdued ""Whip Poor Will"". Armstrong's ""Soon When I'm Gone"" rewrites a Gram Parsons ballad as deathbed transference: ""I hear the clatter of the beetle as she waits for me to tire,"" Armstrong sings, as if absorbing into the cosmos, the songs swirling psychedelically around him. ""I hear the breathing of the earthworm as she crawls a ragged mile.
    </p>
<p>
<em>The Strangest Colored Lights</em> ends not with the George Harrison-style finale of ""Transmissions"", as the tracklist indicates, but with an untitled hidden track that features Armstrong singing about fictional artists who never showed their work. One sings her songs into a jar, which she buries deep in the earth; another has his poems eaten by foxes. Despite being locked in the basement of the album, the song reveals 13ghosts' true concerns: Can making art make them immortal? Ultimately, all this talk of death might be too much too bear were it not for the range of sounds swirling around it: <em>The Strangest Colored Lights</em> is a persistently somber, mostly humorless album, but it's so musically vigorous that you wouldn't mind if they dwelt on death for the rest of their lives.

    Head of Femur have never done small. The Chicago trio surrounds itself with crowds of other musicians in pursuit of a massive, orchestrated sonic bonanza, to the point where it feels faintly ridiculous to even think of them as a three-piece. Even the core trio has undergone changes-- founding member Ben Armstrong is now credited only as a songwriter-- but the basic sound is still intact, with Matt Focht and Mike Elsener trading off vocals and Chris Brickley and Dan Dietrich recording, with Omaha studio whiz AJ Mogis lending his hand on the final mix.</p><p>
    I will say that they've pared back some from the gargantuan arrangements and piles of instruments that characterized their second album, 2005's <em>Hysterical Stars</em>. There are some surprisingly intimate moments on this record, most notably ""Covered Wagons"", which begins with nothing but vocals and piano before finally slipping into a string-drenched second half that nonetheless still manages to sound modest; it's the closest they've ever come to small. The song is almost five minutes old by the time Head of Femur get to the sweeping, jam-packed arrangement we're used to hearing from them.</p><p>
    The decision to sharpen things and use the arrangements to emphasize certain passages, rather than hit you with constant overload, applies to much of the record. ""Jetway Junior"", ""Climbing Up Fire Escapes"", and ""River Ramble"" are all focused, relatively unadorned indie rock songs with sharp melodies and sharper tempos. ""River Ramble"" and ""Climbing Up Fire Escapes"" are both swimming with keyboards-- the former is practically electro-pop, with spiky synths and a pointillist bassline that precisely accents the drums.
    </p>
<p>
    Even without total orchestral overload, they manage to make things sound big. ""Where's the Fire"" is a layer cake of horns, keyboards, busy guitars, and two-part vocal harmonies, and it's just as filling as the analogy suggests. ""Jetway Junior"" also sports strong harmony vocals, in a much more guitar-centric environment. It's the most straightforward indie rock song they've done, and one of their best.
    </p>
<p>
    Head of Femur seem to have realized that less can be more, and in the process they've created a particularly dynamic and varied album. The band's basic sound hasn't changed much from record to record, but each has still felt like a distinct and different statement-- this one seems to be their step back from the excess they made their name on, but just a small one. <em>Hysterical Stars</em> is still my favorite, but <em>Great Plains</em> is nonetheless an excellent album that expands their range and shows us a more intimate side, if only for a moment.<br/>

    David Pajo's tenure in Slint is pretty unimpeachable. But after the tetchy brilliance of <em>Spiderland</em>, things get spotty. Sure, under various M banners, Pajo dabbles hush of folk to subtle effect. Albums like 2001's <em>Whatever, Mortal</em> were songwriting treats, music worthy of brushing elbows with the imposing stuff of his early days, no problem. But for every <em>Live From a Shark Cage</em>, there's a <em>Mary Star of the Sea</em>-- the catastrophic arena-ready byproduct of being an indie rock icon and cavorting with Billy Corgan. So it's fair to be skeptical of the metal band Pajo has scrounged up in Kentucky-- yes, Dead Child-- a cheesily reverent retread of 1980s-minded thrash, vintage hesher skuzz, yadda, yadda, yadda. And if that M.O. sounds familiar, it's because he already did it once with the initial touring incarnation of Early Man (remember them?). Just sub in an unfocused digest of Reagan-era metal in place of the downtown Matador metal dude's dead-on Metallica, and you're pretty much there.</p><p>
    But while Early Man 100% deserved the down-the-nose ""hipster metal"" tag, Dead Child 100% doesn't. This stuff is bad without being ironic. Bad without being calculated. Bad because it just isn't any good. Yes, there are chops here. But save for a few mighty moments, they never get put to any interesting use. ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"" is all oom-pa drumming, tablature-dumb rock guitars, and high school battle of the bands solos. And the too-long-by-four-minutes ""The Coldest Hands"" forgets itself three or four times during its palm-muted sneeroffs. Jukeboxes do it better.</p><p>
    The real issues, though, have nothing to do with the riffage. Pajo and Michael McMahan (of Slint reunion tour fame) play passably, if not inventively. Rather, it's the vocals and guitar tone that really head off <em>Attack</em>. Lead singer Dahm has a thin, nerve-wearing Geddy vs. Ozzy vs. Bruce tone, and the guitars have that blocky, rusted-out desert-rock tenor that works so well for Queens of the Stone Age but seems a bit lite when attempting to throw weight around like real thrash should. When you consider Slint's girth (<em>Tweez</em> was heavy!) and Pajo's oft-professed love of metal, the sound of this record is a real disappointment.
    </p>
<p>
    On occasion, though, that love shines through. ""Rattlesnake Chalice"" works up a nice tension with its hourglass tom rolls and simple guitar figure. And ""Screaming Skull""'s tumble thunder riff is a structural beaut. Still, the fact remains: If it weren't for the famous guy in the band, we'd most likely ignore this record completely, saving space for anyone doing anything remotely creative with the same pedal-to-the-metal toolkit.

They do so after a run of releases that's included hard noise freakouts (<i>Sun Baked Snow Cave</i>, with Merzbow), drug-caked and deadpan Motörhead take-offs (<i>Pink</i>), tepid five-blunt solos [<i>Altar</i>, with SunnO)))], and psych-sessions with Ghost's Michio Kurihara (<i>Rainbow</i>). Most of these recordings came in at least two versions-- Japanese, American, vinyl, CD, smoke signal, etc.-- and, in the case of <i>Dronevil Final</i>, a one stereophonic, two-soundsystem-requiring CD set. If you claim to like everything Boris have done in their decade-plus run, let alone in the past three years, your tolerance for directionless, shapeless, and unending jam sessions is higher than mine.</p>
<p>My guess is the band probably doesn't lose much sleep over the quality or consistency of what they put out, but it was still dispiriting to hear Boris's Atsuo run down <i>Pink</i> in recent interviews. He now refers to the band's ""cool rock"" phase as boring, which is what I'd call the instrumental noise'n'drone suites the band drops on a maddeningly regular basis. No matter: the scuffed-up, scuzzed-out <i>Pink</i> will be their monument, whether they like it or not. Discovering what you're best at would be a thrill to most bands, but to Boris, it apparently felt like a burden, and so <i>Smile</i> is their exquisite-corpse sequel, a near-automatic exercise in drawing inspiration from anybody but themselves. For the Japanese version, the trio went so far as to leave the record behind with engineer and veteran of the Stars You Ishihara, who mixed and mastered it while the band was out of town.</p>
<p>Among those <i>Smile</i> nods toward: The U.S. version opens with a cover of a song by Kenji Sawada, of Pyg/Julie-renown; ""Buzz-In"" is named for the Melvins; another track, apparently, cops lyrics from Japanese band Anthem. A friend by the name of Aso wrote the excellently titled ""You Were Holding An Umbrella"", while Sunn0)))'s Stephen O'Malley plays on the record's final song. Kurihara guests throughout. The Japanese version could credibly have Ishihara's name on the cover, since his demented, scooped-out mixes bear little similarity to what Boris will call <i>Smile</i> in the U.S. There are, as expected, sublime moments on both, but it also seems as if these songs were simply the first eight that the prolific band wrote between one tour and the next.</p>
<p>A band named after a Melvins track wouldn't title a song ""Buzz-In"" lightly, and Boris' tribute begins with a squealing baby, who sings a little bit before the guitars ramp up. After that, the band charges in at its usual half-stoned, half-time boogie. That swagger-- playing from behind the beat-- is likely what's on Atsuo's mind when he talks about ""cool rock,"" which ""Buzz-In"" most assuredly is; why anyone would avoid howling over guitars as finely distorted and oil-slicked as these is anyone's guess. ""Laser Beam"", a whisky-throated, spread-legs titan, dips so low in scuzz and feedback it could be a broken practice-session rehearsal, before a typically Boris pivot: The sound of a computer turning off or on, followed by the emphatically blank return of Takeshi's deadpan vocals. Veering into satire (welcome, for a band who appear to have no sense of humor beyond the name of their label/design firm, Fangs Anal Satan) is ""Statement"", on which the band breaks out both a cowbell and the ""woo-woo"" from ""Sympathy for the Devil"". ""My Neighbor Satan"" is one of those Boris warblers-- like <i>Akuma no Uta</i>'s ""Nothingness Song"", say-- that sounds like it was written, mid voice-crack, by a 16-year-old boy. The untitled finale is an O'Malley collaboration, plus another shot at breaking out the wail, here mitigated by the droning weight of O'Malley's Stonehenge backline.</p>
<p>Those in the market for something truly unfathomable should seek out <i>Smile</i>'s Japanese version. Beyond an entertainingly hollowed out ""Statement"", Ishihara leaves most of the other instrument sounds untreated-- all the better to scrape off your skin. This swarm-of-hornets sound suits a band that consistently hesitates just at it appears ready to turn loose. I also prefer Isihara's version of ""No Ones Grieve"", a <i>The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked 2</i> outtake, which here dispenses with the ceremonial marching of the U.S. version for an undifferentiated, Comets on Fire feedback spray.</p>
<p>It takes a few listens just to sort out which song is which relative to the U.S. version. ""My Neighbor Satan""-- subdued, crooning-- becomes, on the Japanese version, thick, layered: a Justin Broderick outtake, drenched in JAMC fuzz. The O'Malley duet, which ends both versions, is a noisier, more guitar-hero affair via Ishihara, whose instinct is to consistently pull out both extremes (melody, solo-y chaos) in the band's sound. It's a creative way of bluffing some unity from the record.</p>
<p>Boris are clearly proud to have made a record as schizophrenic as <i>Smile</i>, and I have no doubt their method helped them see all sorts of colors while making it. But the band may consider their fellow countrymen, Acid Mothers Temple, whose propensity to make ideally psychedelic but for all purposes identical records has, over time, sucked the surprise out of their ostensibly free-form vortex. It's no crime to make the same record twice when the alternative is making a different one, over and over and over again.</p></div>"|11464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11464-smile/|6.4|Zach Baron

    Fairport Convention are commonly considered to be the first British folk-rock group, which is essentially true even if it doesn't really count for much. Releasing their self-titled debut in 1967, they drew heavily the Byrds, Joni Mitchell, Jefferson Airplane, and especially Bob Dylan, but they weren't merely aping an American trend. Instead, the band mingled those jangly Yankee innovations with British folk traditions, rearranging and exploding old ballads and jigs into crisp new rock songs. The results, as early as their second album, were fairly distinctive, although Fairport Convention (which was named after the house where the band held its first practices) were often mistaken for an American band. At the time, most of the members were in their late teens or early twenties, yet for all the spiritedness of their music, they sound today much older than their years: Vocalist Sandy Denny, who defected from the Strawbs to replace Judy Dyble, possesses a dramatic, soulful voice, while Richard Thompson is impossibly dexterous, tossing out curlicue riffs with a professional's casual precision.</p><p>
    Fairport Convention, of course, had better luck in their homeland than they did in the U.S., to the extent that many of their most popular albums are available only as imports. Righting two wrongs at once, Water Records has reissued the band's second and third albums, <em>What We Did on Our Holidays</em> and <em>Unhalfbricking</em>, both from 1969, and both previously unavailable in America. Legendary producer Joe Boyd oversaw both records, lending them a live sound that complements the musicians' youthful vigor. Generally, these two albums are considered somewhat transitional for the band, gradually tracking the decrease in American influences and the increase in British, all leading up to their biggest album, <em>Liege &amp; Lief</em>. However, neither is a minor album in the Fairport Convention catalog. Heard back to back, they give the impression of a confident band growing even more confident-- almost cocky at times-- as they continue to fine-tune their already complex transatlantic sound.</p><p>
<em>What We Did on Our Holidays</em> begins with Denny's ""Fotheringay"", which takes its name from the castle where Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned and which sounds like it could be attributed to Traditional. Moreover, it's our introduction to Denny's robust, expressive voice, which gives the band new and considerable power, whether she's humming ""The Lord Is in This Place, How Dreadful Is This Place"", or exerting inhuman control on ""She Moves Through the Fair"". The album mixes new interpretations of traditional ballads like ""Nottamun Town"", here rendered almost as a raga, with much newer songs, such as their soulful take on Dylan's ""I'll Keep It With Mine"" and their ponderous version of Mitchell's ""Eastern Rain"". The best material on <em>Holidays</em>, though, may be their own-- the stomping blues-rock of ""Mr. Lacey"", the racing ""No Man's Land"", and the stirring afterlife anthem ""Meet on the Ledge"".
    </p>
<p>
    Instead of jettisoning their borrowed American traits on <em>Unhalfbricking</em>, Fairport Convention find new ways to upend them, as on their playful zydeco-flavored reading of Dylan's ""Si Tu Dois Partir"" (you may know it as ""If You Gotta Go, Go Now"") and their own ""Cajun Woman"", a bracing amalgam of Cajun rhythms, surf melodies, and Beach Boys orchestrations. On ""Sailor's Life"", they turn an old British lament into an eleven-minute jam, showing off the group's improvisational dynamic and Thompson's considerable soloing skills. In the liners for these new reissues, M.C. Taylor calls it ""their own singular form of British country music."" Their cover of Dylan's obscure ""Percy's Song"" takes that idea one step further: The tale of a wrongly imprisoned man, it's not dissimilar to those told by Johnny Cash or Merle Haggard at the same time, yet they make it sound distinctively British and distinctively Fairport Convention. The band build to an intense finale, as Denny sounds more bruised yet more steadfast with each repetition of the refrain ""Turn, turn to the rain and the wind."" More than anything else, <em>Unhalfbricking</em>-- and, to a lesser extent, <em>Holidays</em>-- conveys the band's simple excitement at making music, culminating in their giddy cover of ""Million Dollar Bash"". They trade off vocals and generally egg each other on, creating a joyful ending to the first chapter of their long career.

    Drug addiction is bad, but drama addiction might be worse. That is the lesson of ""Shoulda Known"", Atmosphere's salvo at that stock character, the enabler. Taken from Minneapolis duo's fifth studio album,<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold</span>, the song is more dramatic monologue than soliloquy-- one of those rare moments when Slug isn't plumbing the depths of his favorite subject, Slug. (Watching the video for ""Shoulda Known"", you might gather that Slug's new subject is soon-to-be-rescued American Apparel models.) Even the album's title-- judged against their college-rap classics <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Overcast</span> and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Lucy Ford</span>-- hints that this outing may be less, well, narcissistically emo. Could Atmosphere's sad-clown era really be over? <br/>
<p>
    Slug's lyrics, it turns out, are refreshingly mundane. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">When Life Gives You Lemons </span>comes off not so much as a memoir of a bohemian artist, but as an old liberal's debut short-story collection. It isn't as dull as it sounds. The enabler is one of many resolutely unglamorous figures here, joining a procession of rust-belt standbys-- late-shift waitress, warehouse worker, deadbeat dad, homeless man, Tom Waits-- straight out of Studs Terkel. It's a noble idea, but it doesn't quite suit Slug's talents, which can veer, in typical backpacker fashion, toward the didactic and sentimental. Even so, it is a welcome leap for the MC to step out of his turbulent inner life and into the shoes of unsung-- at least, unrapped-- working-class men and women.</p><p>
    Producer Ant isn't retracing old paths either-- though he finds more success than his partner. He sets ""Shoulda Known"", for instance, above synthetic handclaps and a glum, coldly fuzzed bass that, together, seem like the embryo of a Justin Timberlake track, before the star's producers add the <em>de rigueur</em> layers and velocity. It's a far cry from the humbly retro collage of samples that grounded Ant's signature sound in the past-- and it works. In a marriage of live instrumentation and vintage analog synths, Ant finds a new way to build set pieces for Slug's tortured narratives. Take the soulfully cheesy, ersatz-Gnarls Barkley ""You"", for instance. Sticking to the second-person perspective, and unburdened by the gnawed-to-oblivion themes of drug abuse, ""You"" could have been a strong lead single. Everyone knows about the needle and the damage done; the question forgotten by too many songwriters, faithfully remembered here, is how ordinary folks make it through the day and make ends meet. Along the same lines, at the heart of ""Dreamer"" and ""Guarantees"" are families trying to get by in a broken, dead-end economy.</p><p>
    Obviously the trials of parenthood, not exactly a staple on DJ playlists, loom large in Slug's visions of 9-to-5 life. Lyrically, like the songs in between, those that bookend <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">When Life Gives You Lemons</span> are adventurous precisely because they're not adventurous, not spectacular, not sensational. ""Like the Rest of Us"" introduces the album with a sleepy melody from a child's music box. The song proceeds with a loop of smoky-nightclub pianos, a plaintive backdrop for Slug's smooth whispers about mothers-to-be and casual cocaine users. But a brighter, faster music box gives the album's closer, ""In Her Music Box"", a vibe that is wrier and angrier, perfect for a song about the R-rated nihilism streaming out of parents' car radios. The thread that runs from the first song to the last is a warm sympathy for working-class heroes and antiheroes-- especially the ones trying raise kids.
    </p>
<p>
    More energy and less uniformly drab scenery might have kept these well-intentioned stories from blurring into each other. One that stands apart is the mainstream-aimed ""Guarantees"", which treads dangerously close to mall-core. Too often the duo's slow, spartan approach just assures that songs like ""Your Glasshouse"" and ""The Skinny"" never leave the ground. And the middling tempos are only partly to blame. ""Wild Wild Horses"" leans on a metaphor that, let's face it, will never be pried from the Rolling Stones' <em>Sticky Fingers</em>. 
    </p>
<p>
    That said, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">When Life Gives You Lemons</span> still helps lift Atmosphere further out of indie-rap territory. The shaggy-dog narratives of ordinary people buffeted by everyday tragedies are still rare outside the genre, despite rap's origins in exactly that hue of storytelling. So even when Slug gives in to his inner corniness, we let him off the hook. Granted, the production makes the naturalism pill easier to swallow. Open-minded fans will thank Ant, whose piano-driven works (""Yesterday"", the opening two tracks) and darkly pretty ""Painting"" reveal a mind keeping up with his partner's, amplifying and deepening and, in his phrase, Quincy-Jonesing the record's vistas of blue-collar melancholia.

Obviously, I'm not the first to say it, but seeing how Muxtape has become the spring's hottest, most annoying internet music fad, perhaps it bears repeating. As Eric Harvey has <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/48289-column-silent-party-1""><strong>previously argued</strong></a> on this site, most amateur tastemaking exercises serve social rather than critical functions; they're performances of taste, but don't in any serious way threaten authoritative or professional opinions. In other words, we still need expert compilers like Harry Smith-- enthusiasts who also happen to have extraordinary ears and the knowledge and ability to make sense of their curatorial impulses.</p><p>
<em>Yeti</em> compilations, of course, aren't just expert mixtapes. Integral to the intermittently published Portland-based arts magazine, the enclosed CD converses with Yeti's text-- criticism, fiction, interviews-- and its visual art. Issue #5's three closing tracks, for example, illustrate editor (and Pitchfork contributor) Mike McGonigal's piece on early gospel bluesman Blind Willie Johnson's ""Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground"". The relatively brief, but vigorous and personal essay maps the 1927 recording in the context of prevailing musical and religious currents. And when you hear its sublime penumbral moan and ghostly slide guitar, you'll understand why ""Dark"" is worthy of close musicological reading. But for my money, A.C. and Blind Mamie Forehand's ""Honey in the Rock"" is the <em>Yeti #5</em> track worth the price of admission. In email conversation, McGonigal described it as ""not only one of the most amazing songs of the last hundred years but... a total square one song"", and I heartily cosign. If nothing else, it makes one of the most astonishing uses of a found object-turned-instrument: the lowly service bell.</p><p>
    Music fans who aren't already regular <em>Yeti</em> readers (or devotees of McGonigal's old zine <em>Chemical Imbalance</em>) probably won't buy this volume for its fantastic blues and gospel cuts, Scott Seward's history of folk-metal, or Justin Taylor's Will Oldham interview, but for the four songs (and pen and ink illustration) submitted by some guy named Jeff Mangum. If you're one of the legions who's been stalking Mangum since Neutral Milk Hotel's late-1990s dissolution, these old 78s won't come as much of a surprise. The two cuts by Greek folk singer Marika Papagika sound like shortwave transmissions from a century-lost world, her grave and luminous voice streaking like weak winter sunlight through a crust of hiss and pops. A choral rendition of traditional Georgian (as in Russian) folk song ""Suliko"" is lovely, if unremarkable, and not as exciting as the fourth track-- an unidentified waltz that's probably Asian, most likely 30s, and definitely haunting. Fed with tomatoes and radio wire indeed.
    </p><p>
    The disc also makes room for a fistful of live and previously unreleased tracks that land a little more squarely in the average indie rock listener's comfort zone: Dean &amp; Britta performing ""Tugboat"", a pair of dispatches from Phil Elverum's camp, and tracks from Akron/Family, Atlas Sound, and Iron &amp; Wine.
    </p>
<p>
    Fortunately, the musically voracious McGonigal has some practice mixing songs of wildly divergent genres, styles, and recording quality, so that the honey-harmonied Anglin Brothers' track rolls more gently into the squeal and squawk of Deerhoof's ""Forbidden Fruits"" than you'd ever think possible. If anything doesn't quite work, it's the Radio Sumatra outtakes scattered throughout. While intellectually intriguing, these sound collages are also sonically punishing and wear out their welcome long before their fourth bow. Then again, good mixtapes should challenge listeners, introduce them to unfamiliar sounds that enable them to hear familiar ones differently and, if the mix is really great, whet an appetite for exploration into deeper corners of the musical universe. And before you ask: no, I don't want to hear your Muxtape.

    I couldn't sleep, so I crept downstairs and turned on the TV, only to be confronted by Gregg Araki's 1992 film <em>The Living End</em>. The suicidal, sadomasochistic gay love-death pact the film details was suitably confronting for my fragile fourteen-year-old mind, but really what stayed with me later were images of cars speeding through underpasses at night, and telephone conversations in darkened rooms, all to the soundtrack of cold, nihilistic computer music. Surely, I thought to myself, this was the future. Later on, the actual soundtrack of <em>The Living End</em>-- all snarky late-eighties industrial-rock-- struggled to convincingly stand in for the future for me. But if I want to recreate the way that music felt to me at the time, it's hard to look past the cold delirium futurism of hard-as-nails techno.</p><p>
    One can draw here a slight, vague distinction between the future and the futuristic: Robert Hood's style doesn't sound avant in the ""How'd they do that?"" sense (for that, the best candidate remains the more fractured end of drum &amp; bass), but in its scorched-earth stance towards traditional notions of musicality-- it's less about the profundity (or even proficiency) of technology than the absence of humanity. Like a city carved into the face of a cliff, Hood's brand of techno is defined by the ever-present threat of its harder-faster-stronger impulse tumbling over into outright mindlessness. Of course, one can question this idea of a line beyond which the mind stops, where all that is left is compulsive somatic jerking. And yet, the music itself sounds like it believes in such a brink, and the sense of inhuman restraint required to stop just short of it is integral to its appeal.</p><p>
    For those who have become properly acquainted with dance music only during this decade, the operating principles of Hood's new DJ mix for the Fabric series may seem foreign, even alien: most tracks eschew the recent vogue for narrative development in favor of a near-static loopiness. Narrative is instead provided by Hood's relentless mixing, racing through thirty-two tracks (double the current standard amount) in less than eighty minutes. So it's not surprising that the mix covers a lot of ground, even when at times it can seem to barely change from one track to the next.
    </p>
<p>
    The easiest to like (and probably my favorite) parts of <em>Fabric 39</em> are those which unabashedly embrace the chilly dawn of the post-human, their riotous detail suggesting that something definitely survives beyond us. I'm thinking of the bleepy propulsion of Hood's own ""Element 9"" and especially ""Who Taught You Math"", all darting deliquescing synth patterns -- Detroit techno with all the nebulous ""soul"" replaced by the frenzied activity of hive-building insects-- or ""And Then We Planned Our Escape"", with its cavernous dub echo and scintillating textures. At the opposite end of the spectrum are a selection of tuff (not tough), lightning speed filter-disco productions reminiscent of Derrick May's <em>Mayday</em> mix. These tracks are ""post-human"" only in the strict science fiction sense, their pleasure-centered muscularity close enough to our own enjoyment to suggest, not our obsolescence, but where our desires might take us in the future.
    </p>
<p>
    In between is a swathe of sternly self-censoring machine-music whose appeal is a little less self-evident. The old line that ""you've got to dance to this in a club to truly understand it"" gets wheeled out a little too often for my liking, but it holds true to this extent at least: The lessons of this music are learnt by the body first, and the mind cracks their method only belatedly. Unless you can imagine dancing to Adam Beyer's remix of UK Gold's ""Agent Wood"", its strobing, scraping percussive riffs will hold no meaning, will seem to be merely arbitrary arrangements of noise around a dictatorial beat. However, while the enthusiasts may disagree, from my relatively uninformed perspective there is a line beyond which this music does start to resemble the pointless pound of its detractors' strawman imaginings. It's difficult, for example, to see much to like about the murky thud of Mion's ""Drop The Filter"" or Pacou's ""X-Factor"".
    </p>
<p>
    Where is that line? It's easier to point to examples falling on either side, and thrill to the minimalist but irresistible funk of Hood's ""School"" with its compressed syncopated riffs and distorted vocal samples. You can't move to this groove like you can with house music: at such a blistering tempo, you're locked into the controlling stomp of the kick drum. But your body can register the difference between that stomp and the counter-grooves that ripple across it, such that the arrangement sheds its monolithic appearance, replaced by a deeply satisfying, tense elasticity.
    </p>
<p>
    Pacou-style techno (and I admit that we're now dealing with incredibly fine distinctions, but bear with me) works by eliminating all but the barest traces or echoes of multivalence in the groove, which remains as a mere hope or possibility that the body stubbornly clings to. This makes a little more sense in theory than in practice, taking the inherent tension of this music to a logical extreme that becomes a vanishing point, all but indistinguishable from a joyless thump. On the other hand, the emergence out of such dark stretches can be thrilling in practice fully as much as theory, such as when Pacou's ""All It Takes"" (not very much presumably being his point) gives way to the flashing hi-hats and rising synth paranoia of Phase's ""Mass"".
    </p>
<p>
    Anyway, vanishing points are by definition a matter of perspective, and maybe the only difference between me and the real enthusiast is that their focus has been shifted so as to see even further down that infinitely receding tunnel. One can only guess at what spells of privation would be required to reach such a state; thankfully for the rest of us, <em>Fabric 39</em> rarely demands it, and I have to assume that, if faced with the joyous robo-salsa assault of Los Hermanos' remix of Hood's ""Still Here"", the hardened veteran would succumb as quickly and as easily as I do.

It's that sort of kamizake bravado that makes Les Savy Fav such a fantastic live act.  Seeing that sort of derring-do come from someone like Tim Harrington-- tall, bald, and paunchy-- makes the spectacle even more amazing.   Harrington stalks the stage like a crazed hobo, hanging from any fixtures and pipes within reach, working the crowd like he's equal parts punk-rock provocateur and motivational messiah.  And all the while, as unsuspecting audience members are smothered in his sweaty embrace, the band goes about their business in a professional, kick-ass manner. Not many live experiences available top seeing Les Savy Fav.  Unfortunately, the things that make their live show so great are the same things that make releasing a Les Savy Fav live album a dodgy proposition. That said, <em>After the Balls Drop</em> manages to make the most of these potential shortcomings, offering listeners a charming, warts-and-all portrait of the group.</p><p>
    Given the time and place of the show documented, the group could be forgiven for not being on top of its game.  The recording took place at a Bowery Ballroom New Year's Eve/Day show at 3 a.m., a time of morning that, when coupled with that time of the year, doesn't do many folks any favors (unless I'm the only one going to parties where 3 a.m. means half the party-goers are sleeping and the other half are throwing up).  The crowd sounds up to the challenge, but the group-- Harrington in particular-- takes a long while to get into the spirit of the moment.  Harrington jokes before the set starts that he just came back from running a 5K marathon for the ""Who Needs a Wish Foundation."" It's as plausible an excuse as any for why he sounds out-of-breath when trying to keep up with the show's first song, ""The Equestrian"".  His being out of sorts while trying to both sing and do whatever the hell he decides to do is great when you're actually at the show seeing what's going on.  When you can't see what's going on, however, you're left with some wheezing, panting guy that misses about half the words he's supposed to sing, and a fair number of notes he's supposed to hit.  It's no big deal when dealing with older songs where he's required to scream more than sing-- he kills here on ""The Sweat Descends"" and ""Yawn Yawn Yawn""-- but the more melodically robust songs from <em>Let's Stay Friends</em> (three of which lead off this set) suffer.</p><p>
    The group gets a second wind midway through the set (conveniently enough, around the time Harrington gets the crowd going by asking if they're fading or fired up-- you can guess what won out). LSF gleefully rip through ""The Year Before the Year 2000"" and ""The Lowest Bitter"" (with the latter featuring Harrington on kazoo), then stretches out the seething intro for ""Who Rocks the Party"" (from <em>The Cat &amp; The Cobra</em>).  This gives way to ""Tim's Speech"", a 15-minute track which is actually a seven-minute version of ""Rome"" (from the EP of the same name) and eight superfluous minutes of the crowd calling for an encore, along with a brief speech from Harrington-- after the band returns to the stage-- concerning the issues of trust and an audience member using his sister's ID to get into the show.
    </p><p>
    What follows the speech is the real reason to drop some cash on this set-- five enthusiastic covers of variable quality that bring the show home.  The versions of Creedence Clearwater Revival (""Hey Tonight"") and the Misfits (""Astro Zombies"") are the best of the bunch, though the group's run through the chosen Pixies (""Debaser"") and Nirvana (""Sliver"") tracks are also fun.  Their ramshackle campfire version of Love's ""Everybody's Gotta Live"" is the perfect closer for a set that ultimately sounds less like a show held at a legitimate concert venue and more like the sort of raucous hoe-down you'd find at a house party.

    ""Too many deaths and betrayals, too many lies,"" sings Stuart Staples on the seventh Tindersticks album, providing a handy episode update for those finally just joining the Nottingham noir-soul sextet. But, as it appears in the context of the breezy piano-rolled folk lullaby ""The Flicker of a Little Girl"", the line sounds less like an advertisement for Tindersticks' signature brand of sorrow than a repudiation of it-- that after nearly two decades of pondering love and all its attendant emotions (jealousy, misery, numbness), Staples regrets to inform you he's all out of regret.</p><p>
    But then Staples hasn't so much turned a new leaf as had one turned for him: In 2006, half of his band turned in their resignation papers, most notably Dickon Hinchcliffe, who, in the most reductive rock-speak, was the Richards to Staples' Jagger (if Keith was a violin player and wrote a mean brass arrangement). And amid a career marked by label changes, Tindersticks-- reconstituted as a five piece-- once again find themselves with a new North America benefactor: Constellation Records, whose godspeed-dominated roster is becoming increasingly populated with former major-label-bankrolled eccentrics (Vic Chestnutt, Carla Bozulich) seeking artistic refuge and a second (or third) wind.</p><p>
    Ironically, Tindersticks' first offering to the most notoriously non-conformist indie label this side of Dischord is an album that feels remarkably in tune with contemporary British pop music's neo-soul slant. Though for Tindersticks, this is hardly a product of calculated trend-spotting: The band have been leavening their blue-eyed/black-lung balladry with classic soul touches-- warm Hammond organ tones, tambourine-rattled rhythms, female back-up singers— as far back as 1999's un-ironically titled <em>Simple Pleasures</em>, an album that, at the time, seemed to pale next to the string-swept dramatics that defined Tindersticks' epochal first three albums. But nine years on, that move seems brilliantly prescient-- to the point where, now, it's not a stretch to envision Staples selling <em>The Hungry Saw</em>'s first single, the nocturnal soul knockout ""Yesterdays Tomorrows"", to Amy Winehouse and retiring a happy man.
    </p>
<p>
    Naturally, that song appears second on the new album's tracklist (following a typically solemn introductory piano piece), because Tindersticks have always been a second-song band, opting for low-key opening tracks before delivering a bold follow-up strike-- from the devastating ""A Night In"" on 1995's self-titled second album, to the simmering ""Heard It Through the Grapevine"" strut of ""People Keep Comin' Around"" on 2001's <em>Can Our Love…</em> to the raging pocket symphony ""Say Goodbye to the City"" on 2003's <em>Waiting for the Moon</em>. But in <em>The Hungry Saw</em>'s case, the early appearance of ""Yesterday Tomorrow""-- with its booming drumbeat, lustrous organ tones and brassy accents-- seems designed to assert that Hinchcliffe's departure has not diminished the band's cinematic scope. With that business settled, the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation, in the spirit of Staples' recent solo efforts.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, Staples' bruised baritone has always formed the emotional core of just about every Tindersticks song. However, the band's most arresting moments have come when Staples' vulnerable voice seems on the verge of being swept up by the musical maelstroms stewing around him, and, with few exceptions, The Hungry Saw doesn't really try to test his fortitude: with their smoky, solitary atmosphere and muted string arrangements, ""The Other Side of the World"" and ""All the Love"" are textbook Tindersticks ballads-- and beautifully rendered ones at that-- but they don't ever go for the throat like their closest antecedent, <em>Waiting for the Moon</em>'s stunning orchestral set piece, ""My Oblivion"".
    </p>
<p>
    Instead, The Hungry Saw's temperate approach feels like the work of a band who are grateful for a new lease on life, but not sure exactly what to do with it, proffering brief experiments that amount to little more than amusing curios (the self-explanatory ""The Organist Entertains"") or instrumentals that sound like guide tracks waiting for a vocal supplement (the tremoloed psychedelic samba of ""E Type""). The laissez-faire feeling seems most pronounced on ""Mother Dear"", a fog-covered hymnal guided by muffled organ tones and a subterranean drum stomp that-- just after Staples utters the line ""it's not so serious, after all""-- is mischievously interrupted by arrhythmic blues riffing that suggests the band has a sense of humour about their downcast demeanor. It's immediately followed by ""Boobar"", which for its opening 20 seconds, suggests another solitary Staples serenade about lost love, before slowly blossoming into a wonderful Spectorized call-and-response finale. If <em>The Hungry Saw</em> teaches us anything new about Tindersticks, it's that these moments of levity no longer serve as brief, incongruous respites from the bleakness, but instead form a series of steps toward an end goal of contentment-- as epitomized by closing track ""The Turns We Took"". The titular line is completed by the words ""…to get here""-- ""here"" being a soothing, string-swirled Velvet Underground groove over which Staples catalogues a lifetime of cruel twists and-- perhaps speaking for the entire band-- decides there's no shame in walking the straight line.

    Dance-y dub bass lines conjoined to spazzy tribal-punk drums isn't necessarily the rarest find, but add a shrieky, front-porched, heel-stomping folky violin as the main melodic instrument and the novelty blossoms. That this spirited and uncommon foundation is being worked by three lesbian punks from Portland, Ore., and that two of them are African-American, and that all three sing, yelp, and shout-- often in-the-round, sometimes in unison-- makes things increasingly more interesting and even harder to peg.</p><p>
    Add to those unlikely equations the fact that these young ladies have done their homework regarding subcultural agitators: Two of them, violinist Osa Atoe and drummer Adee Roberson, had known each other through the underground zine trading scene where they each documented and heralded black subculture (political, musical, visual arts) and riot grrrl bands in their respective publications <em>Shotgun Seamstress</em> (Atoe's), and <em>Finger on the Trigger</em> (Roberson's now retired mag). This appears to have laid a good foundation for not only quality prose (diggin' the inner strength-seeking childlike fantasy lyrics of ""No. 17"" and ""Tree""), but sonically may have helped them to crib a little from heroes like ESG, Sleater-Kinney, the Raincoats, and Kleenex.</p><p>
    On paper, the New Bloods' disparate musical styles don't sound like such a great combo: Tunes such as ""Behind Mountains"" and ""Doubles"" contrast angular and aggressive rhythmic bass and drum attacks with a joyously twisted Americana violin-- too arty to call it a fiddle-- but then on top of all that are bouncy bassist Cassia Gammill's velvety smooth vocal lines, Atoe's punky sing-song-y speak-sing, and Roberson's sporadic reggae-toasting shouts. It shouldn't work, but it does. It's a wild and wonderful combination where weird individual parts coalesce to make a unified songwriting machine. Two of the album's best tracks, opener ""The Secret Life"" and ""Oh, Deadly Nightshade!"" show off smart songcraft and a groove-based group-mind: The former takes distinctive passages that flow breezily-- even though clanky drums rumble underneath-- only to lock in for unison group-vocal barking. And the circular and trancey ""Oh, Deadly Nightshade!""-- probably the most musically refined track-- flips from pizzicato strings to staccato bowing to ""Skip to My Lou"" ho-downs as vocal styles and phrasings simultaneously keep morphing.
    </p>
<p>
    For a debut with such a fully realized and individual presence, something tells me these ladies are going to continue to burrow as wide as this earnest, impressive debut hits deep. The only real complaint, and this should easily be rectified as they keep rocking together, is that a few songs do suffer from awkward vocal phrasings (""The Sea is Alive in Me"") and a sometimes sloppy off-kilterness (""The Cycle Song""). But delicate and deliberate tunes like the fully a cappella ""Day After Day"" and, once again, the self-titled track, hint at future magical possibilities.<br/>

    Athens, Ga., is a scene brimming with well-known national acts. Athens, Ohio? Not so much. If that makes the college town's Southeast Engine relatively big fish in a small pond, that still hardly means many people have heard the band splashing around. Indeed, 2005's mostly overlooked <em>Coming to Terms With Gravity</em> was solid if not wholly compelling Americana in the just-left-of-traditional mold (think: Wilco), though clearly leader Adam Remnant wasn't completely comfortable being pegged as alt-country.</p><p>
    If <em>A Wheel Within a Wheel</em> isn't exactly the sound of a band casting off its shackles, it is the sound of a band at least buckling a little to conventions. Instrumentally, with its emphasis on rootsy piano and strings, much of <em>A Wheel Within a Wheel</em> still scans as Americana. It's the substance where things get stretched a bit, with strong, personal, sometimes powerful results that potentially could raise the group's profile.</p><p>
<em>A Wheel Within a Wheel</em> begins with a cynical epiphany, blasted out with the opening ""Taking the Fall"". It's not necessarily an exceptional song, but it does set the tone for the rest of the disc. ""Now it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust/ Well, I've always done what I've wanted but now I do what I must,"" proclaims Remnant, and that same disillusionment with the inevitable winds its way through nearly every track. Love/hate, life/death, truth/lies-- the album's nothing so much as a series of bitter revelations that the innocence of youth is an illusion, and that anyone looking only to man for guidance is doomed.
    </p>
<p>
    The title <em>A Wheel Within a Wheel</em> is a reference to the book of Ezekiel, where god is depicted as a sort of multi-dimensional hallucinogenic elemental vision, four creatures combined as one, accompanied by lightning, fire, and noise. Said wheel makes a few appearances throughout the album, most notably following as overt a cry for help as you can get, a song not so subtly titled ""Oh God, Let Me Back In"". Yet <em>A Wheel Within a Wheel</em> is more complex than the average Christian rock tract. The Biblical/religious imagery running throughout the disc doesn't tip the group's hand so much as provide the album a fruitful thematic framework as Remnant shouts into the abyss in search of answers.
    </p>
<p>
    Given the neo-theological angst of the album, it's not much of a shock that the music often matches the soul dividing sturm und drang driving the disc. It's rock opera, part Dante, part indie du jour, bombastic, to be sure, but never hectoring as it makes its way to moral détente. In fact, the album's plea to god comes not as righteousness but only after Remnant himself (or at least the album's narrator) hits rock bottom. ""Taking the Fall"" (""fall"" being a particularly loaded word here) and ""Ostrich"" tackle the trauma of learning life isn't always fair, and, hey, we're all going to die some day, anyway. In the brisk ""We Have You Surrounded"", cynicism and doubt have totally taken over, the divine gift of free will subverted to reject the attendant catches. In ""Quit While You're Ahead"", Remnant is desperate for some guidance: ""Tell me what I believe,"" he pleads.
    </p>
<p>
    By ""Pursuit of Happiness"" (in two parts), the aimlessness of nihilism begins to weigh on his soul. ""When the facts turn into fiction, your voice is overturned/ Do you still believe in nothing?"" He's answered in ""Psychoanalysis"", where recollections of childhood give way to the telltale vision of the wheel within a wheel and, as far as the story goes, a fateful choice: embrace the ""State of Oblivion"", or look to the lord for salvation? The album goes the latter route, if only because it makes for a much better narrative arc. Between the end of the world and everlasting happiness, goes the reasoning, why would anyone choose the former?
    </p>
<p>
    Needless to say, the aforementioned explicit cry for god's forgiveness is answered and accepted, but to Remnant's credit all is not left neat and tidy. If anything, the comfort of god makes life more bearable but no more fair. ""All I've been taught to really know turns to dust or turns to stone,"" concludes ""Fortune Teller"". But in the concluding ""Let It Be So"", that doesn't seem as bad as it sounds. Remnant's been tested and emerged stronger, the knowledge of injustice and pain not a curse but the key to move beyond empty fatalism. God's gift, it turns out, is allowing us to know that the future is what we make of it.
    </p>
<p>
    ""So let Fortune turn her wheel, and let the serpent take its tail out of its mouth,"" sings Remnant, finally at ease with the understanding that happiness is his, if he wants it. ""I'm here to love you,"" he sings, to god, to a lost love, to all of the above. ""That's the happiness I pursue.""<br/>

If the style of music they play were a star, they would be a planet that arrived to orbit it decades after it faded out. It's a phenomenon that's grown in the last ten years: Western bands building their music on an obscure, vaguely familiar blueprint from outside their own culture. There are scores of North American and European Afrobeat bands, and Dengue Fever pattern themselves on Cambodian garage rock. It's cultural imperialism in reverse; these bands embrace the sometimes-unexpected way in which musicians in other countries interpreted our own music and use it as inspiration.</p><p>
    That Chicha Libre's debut album is out on Barbés Records makes sense. It's the label, after all, that last year released the excellent <em>Roots of Chicha</em> compilation, a disc that highlighted the chicha music of Amazonian Peru. Like Tropicália, soukous, and reggae, Chicha was a syncretic pop style, built on the back of the Colombian cumbia, a dance form with roots in West Africa. Chicha musicians used the cumbia's rhythmic foundation, underpinning their songs with congas, shakers, and claves, but replaced the traditional acoustic guitars and accordions with electric guitars, basses, and Farfisa organs. They also grafted on the pentatonic scales of traditional Andean and Amazonian music and incorporated elements of Cuban and American pop, especially surf guitar music.</p><p>
    The result of all this blending was something totally original and distinctive. It became the soundtrack to the sudden urbanization of far inland Peru, as the mid-60s oil boom swept across the country's rugged and vast Loreto region. In cities like Iquitos, which rests on the bank of the Amazon, it was a thrilling new thing to dance to, quite unlike anything available before it. And because surf music itself was syncretic, borrowing melodies and pentatonic scales from Greece and Middle East, it fit right in as an element of the new sound. The name comes from a Latin American equivalent of a microbrew-- chicha is a family of fermented beverages made of widely varied base ingredients in Central and South America. In northern Peru, the word was also uniquely used to describe the transient lifestyle of temporary workers.
    </p><p>
    Chicha eventually spread all the way to Lima on the coast, but never gained wide notoriety, in part because of its low-class origins. Even most compilations of Peruvian rock music leave it out in favor of garage bands like Los Yorks and Anglicized psych bands like We All Together (both of which are great, nonetheless). Something so powerful had to come back to the surface eventually, though, and now that it has, Chicha Libre is there to breathe some new life into it, taking the sound back to its roots (modern chicha groups tend to sound pretty different from their forebears, using digital synths and drum machines) while adding a few of their own touches.
    </p>
<p>
<em>¡Sonido Amazonico!</em> takes its title from a stunning psychedelic surf instrumental by Los Mirlos, one of the best and most vital chicha bands. A faithful and great cover of that song leads of the album, immediately grasping the humid vibe that makes old-time chicha so arresting. The psychedelic organ solo is fantastic. The members   don't exactly have Latino names-- Burrows, Camp, Conan, Cudahy, Douglas, and Quigley-- but they do sing in Spanish (quite competently), and they approach the music with genuine affection but not so much that they're slaves to their influences.
    </p>
<p>
    For instance, distortion was exceedingly rare in chicha music, but they employ a modest amount of it on the opening guitar theme of ""Primavera en la Selva"", a brilliant track that borrows melodic themes for the organ and guitar from Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" and garage rocks the hell out of them. Nicking classical themes was a favorite habit of chicha bands (Los Destellos' version of ""Für Elise"" is amazing), and Chicha Libre pick up the thread, cutting a version of a Ravel pavane and closing the album with a slinky surf-cumbia version of Satie's ""Gnosienne No.1"". They also do one of the best versions of Gershon Kingsley's pop standard ""Popcorn"" I've ever heard, and I've heard dozens of versions of that song. ""Indian Summer"" gets an exotica injection courtesy of Allyssa Lamb's ethereal guest vocal.
    </p>
<p>
    Though they are obviously tailoring their talents to fit a specific sonic mold, the efforts of the band members don't sound forced. In fact, they seem to write in the style with a minimum of effort. Perhaps it's simply the fact that a well-constructed melody can be adapted to just about any setting, but I think the songwriting is ultimately why the album transcends the novelty of being a tribute to an entire style of music almost no one outside of Peru has heard of.
    </p>
<p>
    As much as I'm in love with the record, though, I admit that it is still probably destined for a niche market of listeners who are interested in these sorts of global melting pot sounds-- Spanish lyrics likely won't help it on that front. Not that that's a bad thing, just a marketplace reality. Regardless, <em>¡Sonido Amazonico!</em> achieves what it sets out to do, which is to pay creative homage to an overlooked genre from a corner of the world few of us will ever see but all of us are invisibly connected to by the weather.

But the biggest twist to his third album, <em>Jim</em>, might just be its lack of left turns. <em>Jim</em> isn't quite Lidell's <em>Sea Change</em>, but it's close, and not only because the singer and producer recently toured and recorded with Beck. Despite a few uptempo rockers, the album is generally subdued; its perspective is almost confessional.</p><p>
    On the surface a collection of love songs, <em>Jim</em> remains obsessed with the themes of emotional imbalance, self-doubt, and dual identity that Lidell introduced on 2005's <em>Multiply</em>. Building on the blueprint drafted for that album, <em>Jim</em> deepens the singer's engagement with 1960s and 70s r&amp;b across a carefully crafted set of ballads, rave-ups, and easygoing soul, showing off not only his considerable vocal chops but also the songwriting and studio prowess of his longtime collaborators Gonzales and Mocky. (Co-producer Mocky shares songwriting credits on virtually all the album's songs; Gonzales had a hand in two, and the Tower Recordings' collaborator Andre Vida, responsible for <em>Multiply</em>'s horns, is credited on one.) Given Lidell's past provocations, <em>Jim</em>'s spoonful of sugar will likely disorient some fans. But thick with hooks and Hammonds, funk squelch and background doo-wop, <em>Jim</em> nevertheless makes for some of the most satisfying Sunday-morning listening you'll hear this year. That Gonzalez and Mocky also played significant roles in the creation of Feist's <em>The Reminder</em> shouldn't be surprising. (Lidell appeared on that album as well: he sings and is credited as ""Energy Arranger"" on ""So Sorry"".) For all Lidell's background in the trenches of the rave scene and its experimental aftermath, <em>Jim</em> is unabashedly pop in spirit and feel-good in sound.</p><p>
    After Lidell's abrasive first record, 2000's <em>Muddlin' Gear </em>and the avant-funk he concocted in the duo Super_Collider (with Chilean-English techno veteran Cristian Vogel), <em>Multiply</em>'s sparkling keyboards, taut electric funk, and rattling tambourines often earned accusations of pastiche. That wasn't always far off: The album's songwriting, production and vocal delivery are deeply indebted to the soul tradition from Stax to Motown, Prince to D'Angelo. With its plucked bass and careful treble counterpoints, ""Multiply"", a song about the joys of a split personality, sounds almost like a repurposed ""(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay"". That combination of subject matter and source material ought to have been enough to undercut the charges that <em>Multiply</em> tried too hard to be ""authentic,"" but it wasn't. You can find a typical criticism in Andy Kellman's review for Allmusic.com, where he calls the album ""as authentic as any neo-soul release""-- a faint-praise damnation that makes ""authenticity"" sound positively counterfeit-- and complains that ""there's so much overly earnest, reverential, 'let's get back to making <em>real</em> music' energy floating around that you can sense it nibbling away at the desire to make something that sounds like today.""</p><p>
    If anything, there's even more pastiche on <em>Jim</em>, but that never stops the music from sounding relevant. (Part of <em>Jim</em>'s pleasure is that it doesn't sound terribly concerned about the sound of ""today."") The rollicking ""Where D'You Go"" is an exercise in sock-hopping 50s rock'n'roll. ""Out of My System"" burns a hole through the back of James Brown's cloak. ""Hurricane"" could almost be a White Stripes song, if they spent more time listening to the Meters and less with Led Zep. ""Out of My System"" is even more shameless in its borrowings, opening with a riff stolen from Bob Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"" and closing with railroad-whistle chants straight out of the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"". (The reference to the latter act-- as well as the ""Sheriff""-covering Eric Clapton-- serves as a useful reminder that Lidell is hardly the first white, English artist to find inspiration in African-American musical traditions.)
    </p><p>
    Indeed, after listening to the heavily acoustic, era-faithful <em>Jim</em>, <em>Multiply</em> begins to sound like more of an ""electronic"" release than ever before. For all its debt to American soul forebears, the album was riddled with clever edits, digital effects, and transient random noise bursts. <em>Jim</em> may have been recorded in Berlin, Paris, and L.A., but its natural reverbs and warm room tones sound more intimate than that jetsetting might suggest. On <em>Jim</em>, the ""experimental"" bits are folded more deeply into the whole. A few minutes into ""Little Bit of Feel Good"", there's an ambient blues bridge where the soloing saxophone takes a weird modal leap; build out a loop of that and you might have the basis for a Rune Grammofon release. But by and large, the outré moments have been toned down and blended in, as with the drifting electronic touches of ""Figure Me Out"". Far more unified than <em>Multiply</em>, the album has a satisfyingly cohesive arc, although the comparatively banging ""Out of My System"" and ""Hurricane"" may well get left off of the make-out music playlists inspired by more Al Green-influenced fare like ""Green Light"".</p><p>
<em>Jim</em> might be far less interesting were it not for the ambiguities that Lidell brings to the table. His turn towards the personal is right there in the title; the press release goes so far as to declare, ""Jamie is <em>Jim</em>."" But it's never so easy with Lidell. He's a notoriously slippery artist straddling two scenes-- underground electronic-music subculture and indie hegemony-- obsessed with authenticity and distrustful of ambition. It's never clear whether <em>Jim</em> is also Jamie, or whether the titular character is just that, a character-- Lidell's Jim Shady, perhaps. Most of the songs on <em>Jim</em> are sung in second person, but Lidell's lyrical declarations cut in unpredictable ways. ""Another Day"", in which he sings of searching for ""another day/ Another way for me to open up to you"" might just be a love song, like a good half of the album's 10 tracks. But when he sings, ""I used to scream when a whisper would do,"" it's hard not to be reminded of Lidell's rep as a belter and a noisemaker, and wonder if he's not addressing the conspicuous mellowing of his sound.</p><p>
    But ultimately, such biographical bits are probably of the greatest interest to lit-crit schooled music reviewers and potential stalkers. <em>Jim</em> succeeds by virtue of its polish. The record <em>sounds</em> simply wonderful: alternately nubby and spangled, it's like a cashmere throw that turns intermittently into a showman's cape. Lidell's voice has never sounded better than it does here. With his mellifluous melismas and effortless fillips, he's as captivating here as his sweat-soaked, seat-of-his-pants Doppelganger is on stage, just for different reasons. Three years ago, reviewing Lidell's chaotic live set, Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal wrote that ""Lidell's focus on his ancillary musical wares-- and not his main-stage voice-- seemed to demonstrate that his popular crooner persona may just be a seriously enjoyable excursion rather than a nostalgic destination."" From the Bacharach-inspired kitsch of ""Another Day"" to the touches of Nick Drake on the closing ""Rope of Sand"", <em>Jim</em> now suggests otherwise: This is an album by an artist getting comfortable with his softer side. It's another welcome surprise.

Should it represent a group's career? If so, <em>The Best of Joy Division</em> falls short, offering nothing from the band's early demos (as Warsaw) or their debut EP, <em>An Ideal For Living</em>. Should it consist of the most popular songs? On that count, this collection succeeds, but that's nebulous too, since Joy Division only released two full-length albums and six singles. Should it simply be unique? That's where this collection really falters: nearly half of its 14 tracks come from the recently-reissued <em>Unknown Pleasures</em> and <em>Closer</em>, and most of the rest are on the more purposeful singles compilation <em>Substance.</em></p><p>
    In fact, the bigger puzzle is why Rhino chose to release this instead of an expanded version of <em>Substance </em>(or at least replicate the British <em>Best of</em>, which included a second disc of Peel Sessions and an Ian Curtis interview). Maybe it's a rights issue, or maybe the label assumes that the recent biopic <em>Control </em>created new fans interested enough to lay out some cash but oddly unwilling to buy both Joy Division albums. It would be wrong to complain about anyone owning even a small amount of this band's great music, but the idea of being satisfied by a Whitman's sampler is strange.</p><p>
    Still, <em>The Best of Joy Division</em> is by Joy Division, so it's good. It's hard to imagine how any such collection wouldn't be-- just shuffle the four-disc set <em>Heart and Soul</em>, make an album of the first 14 tracks that come up, and you'd have a winner. The essentials-- ""Transmission"", ""She's Lost Control"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Love Will Tear Us Apart""-- nestle well against album cuts, and there are nice juxtapositions, like the way ""Heart and Soul""'s throb kickstarts the post-punk-in-a-nutshell ""Incubation"", which morphs into ""Isolation""'s dubby pulse. One could quibble about omissions-- ""A Means to An End"" from <em>Closer,</em> ""Day of the Lords"" from <em>Unknown Pleasures</em>-- but every song on <em>The Best of Joy Division</em> is great.</p><p>
    Regardless, there's that unmistakable air of non-necessity to this collection. It's clearly for the timidly uninitiated, and sure, it's better for anyone to hear 14 random Joy Division songs than none. But if you have any interest in this remarkable band, save the startup cash and buy <em>Unknown Pleasures</em> and <em>Closer </em>first, then <em>Substance,</em> then <em>Heart and Soul</em>. It's not a lot to invest in a group whose accomplishments continue to pay off 28 years after its demise.</p></div>"|11452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11452-the-best-of-joy-division/|6.0|Marc Masters

    Comparisons are inevitable with Jucifer.  They're a guy-girl
    garage rock duo, which automatically brings up the White Stripes.  But in
    Jucifer, the girl, Amber Valentine, is up front, and remains wedded to
    the guy, Edgar Livengood.  Valentine's more naked vocal moments evoke a
    young PJ Harvey; she also sometimes sounds like Courtney Love in better
    days.  Other precedents include Boss Hog, the garage rock (and likewise
    married) duo of Jon Spencer and Cristina Martinez, and Kim Gordon, when
    she cuts loose over Sonic Youth's bluesy side.</p><p>
    But Jucifer's range far exceeds that of these bands.  Smart pop,
    quiet balladry, and bludgeoning sludge metal are all fair game, making
    the band's records feel like patchwork.  Valentine's voice ties things
    together, however; her croon sounds equally at home over acoustic
    guitar and Jucifer's wall of amps.  (The band is famed for insanely
    loud shows involving upwards of 10-15 amp cabinets.)  In Boss Hog,
    Cristina Martinez achieved some success with cooing over abrasion. 
    However, Valentine sounds sweet and relatively innocent, which makes
    her screaming that much more startling during Jucifer's tougher moments.<span id=""uwj2"" style=""font-style: italic""></span></p><p>
<span id=""uwj2"" style=""font-style: italic"">L'autrichienne</span> is
    the band's most ambitious work yet.  It's a sprawling, 21-song concept
    album about Marie Antoinette, who was nicknamed ""l'Autrichienne"" due to
    her Austrian origin and connections.  Valentine tackled the subject
    after finding a book on the French Revolution in an RV park lending
    library.  (She and Livengood have lived on the road in an RV for the
    past seven years; their MySpace lists them as ""NOMADS 4EVER."")  The
    album's liner notes are endearingly nerdy, appending historical
    commentary to each song.
    </p>
<p>
    Yet this is no highbrow endeavor.  The reassurance of a unifying
    concept allows the band to stretch out further than ever.  Ragged rock
    is the record's axis, around which rotate considerably varying
    dynamics.  ""The Mountain"" and ""Procession a la Guillotine"" erect walls
    of fuzz worthy of doom metal.  One of the band's pet moves is to use
    hardcore punk as an EKG spike.  ""Blackpowder"" leads off the album with
    sturdy rock, only to be steamrolled by ""Thermidor"", essentially early-1990s New York hardcore punk.  Then, Valentine sings over only her
    guitar, evoking a more extroverted Kristin Hersh.  In ""Champs De Mars"",
    Valentine sings quietly menacing tritones, then slams into surging
    riffs; it's pure PJ Harvey circa <span id=""n8y1"" style=""font-style: italic"">Dry</span>.
    </p>
<p>
    For all the band's power, it shines most when it sheathes it. 
    Previously, when Jucifer held back, rough edges remained, and
    Valentine's purr was charmingly out of place.  Now the band has learned
    how to adorn its quiet; the transformation recalls the Rolling Stones
    on <span id=""c3y5"" style=""font-style: italic"">Aftermath</span>. 
    ""Armada"" mushrooms from a sludgy crawl to imperial horns and lush vocal
    harmonies.  The title track's supple clean tones and drumming evoke
    Jimi Hendrix and Mitch Mitchell.  A wounded bird of a melody crawls in,
    keening with startling candor.  Robert Christgau says the White Stripes
    build monuments that are no place to settle down.  Jucifer's garage
    rock, in contrast, is like their RV -- richly appointed and very much
    home.

By third album <em>Box of Hair</em> in 1996, Vancouver-based trio Cub had settled into a consistent lineup-- drummer Lisa G, bassist/frontwoman Lisa Marr, and guitarist Robynn Iwata-- and established a distinctive style: sugary three-chord indie pop, cuddly as it was catchy, with a spoonful of punk's spiky do-it-yourself energy. Their closest peers were such melodic and unabashedly girlish-voiced acts as Amelia Fletcher's Talulah Gosh, Rose Melberg's Tiger Trap, or Juliana Hatfield's Blake Babies. Yet along with more likely bedfellows They Might Be Giants, who have since segued into children's music, Cub toured with the sad-bastard likes of Sebadoh and Elliott Smith.</p><p>
    Cub toughen up their guitar tones and their vocal chords for <em>Box of Hair</em>, but, thankfully, they don't lose too much of themselves trying to appeal to the punker-than-thou types who used to heap scorn on anything cute or girly (plenty of people still do). ""Freaky"" starts the album at a breakneck pace, Lisa Marr's voice turning into a phlegmy sneer, but the refrain is ""Let's play house."" On ""Magic 8 Ball"", Marr serenades a crush with a list of lucky charms, as accordion, lilting harmonies, and a rickety, Merseybeat-esque backing move to a chorus about the title toy. One of Cub's best-ever songs? Decidedly so. Summery sex bomb ""Pillow Queen"", princess-obsessed substance-abuse ode ""Loaded"", and saw-backed insult ""Box of Hair"" all use a little distortion and aggression to help the sweetness go down. ""Main and Broadway"", with its chiming lead guitars and homey melancholy, should appeal to fans of present-day indie-poppers like Voxtrot and Vampire Weekend.</p><p>
<em>Box of Hair</em> isn't always as successful as recently reissued predecessors <em>Betti Cola</em> and <em>Come Out, Come Out</em>, but even the plainer tracks pack a joyful punch. Feedback-drenched ""One Last Kiss"" is about as rowdily mosh-ready as Cub get, Marr belting out, ""Give it to me, baby"" with the insolence of a twee Iggy Pop. The album's basic framework doesn't vary much, though. While the second half's slight change-ups-- barnstorming riff-rock on ""S.G."", lead vocals by guitarist Iwata on ""Way to Go"", violin on ""Riverside""-- aren't enough to make these songs stand out in context, they'd still have a warm charm played individually on, say, college radio.
    </p><p>
    As if to prove to the boys they can do it, Cub end the LP with a rocket-fueled live version of ""Not What You Think"", sung-screamed by drummer G after a quick countdown. ""I wanna be alone!"" she shouts. Writing in <em>SF Weekly</em> in 1996, author and former <em>The New York Times</em> guest columnist Sarah Vowell concluded that this thrashing hardcore track redeemed a record she otherwise considered to be excessively sweet: ""<em>Box of Hair</em> is a one-song album -- but what a song."" While <em>Box of Hair</em> was Cub's best bet to please people for whom My Little Pony could never be punk, if you're listening to Cub for their ""god-awful noise,"" go ahead and suffer through the album's hidden-track half hour of bed creaks, which lead into an aborted ""Not What You Think"" outtake. Everybody else should leave that bullshit off their iPods and come expecting a disc that sounds like the photo in the CD liner: a fuzzy, adorable kitten, who happens to look like he's about to snarl. Break out your Strawberry Shortcake lunchbox and dig in.

The outside of the fold-out features four black-and-white photos of the exterior of a dilapidated house; on the opposite side are the members of the band looking through the house's windows, each face filling the entire frame.  You can create a tiny box with this insert if you stand it on its edge and touch the two end pages together-- a small abandoned house out in the middle of nowhere, with the band looking in at each other from the outside.  It's a perfect metaphor for this confounding yet alluring album.</p><p>
    The record itself fittingly kicks off with some false starts, with drummer Adam Vida sounding like a lawnmower engine that won't turn over.  Eventually, the band finally breaks into ""Slow Ghosts"", a lurching spastic number punctuated with chirpy guitar runs and bouts of harmonized moaning. With two former members of U.S. Maple on baord-- Adam Vida and guitarist Todd Rittman-- some listeners will peg this album in those terms.  (Anyone hoping to draw direct sonic connections between Robert Lowe's work with 90 Day Men and this album, on the other hand, will end up disappointed.)  In those fleeting moments when there's a particularly frantic guitar filigree (either by Rittman or Ben Vida), or a certain stumbling roll of the drums, it sounds like Al Johnson's indomitable hoarse wheeze is the only thing keeping the U.S. Maple name off the spine.  However, where Singer's music most emulates the former works of its members is in its sense of musical anti-orthodoxy-- love them or loathe them,  what they tried to do didn't sound like much else around.  For Singer, this iconoclasm extends beyond the actual music.</p><p>
    Instead of having one frontman, Singer opts to treat the band as a true democracy, giving every member their turn at the microphone.  Good luck trying to figure out which one is which, though-- the disc credits only include who's on the record and who produced it, and more often than not they're singing together.  Solo or in unison, their quivering falsettos and affected croons might owe something to David Bowie or any of his followers, but ultimately the group's vocal turns are just as individualistic as their musical accompaniment.  One minute they're aping the madrigal whimsy of labelmates Faun Fables (on ""Divining""), the next  they're looping guitar drones in back of passionate vocal quivering (on ""Mauvais Sang"").  Handholds and signposts are few and far between, and any groove the band locks into can just as easily be transformed or simply abandoned without warning.  There's an organic jazz-like spontaneity to <em>Unhistories</em> that listeners will consider either obnoxious or endearing.  These tracks are less like songs and more like awkward whispered conversations between people that are just beginning to know each other.  While the end results of these ""talks"" might bear fruit that most would rather do without, these are definitely conversations worth having.</p></div>"|11422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11422-unhistories/|6.2|David Raposa

Not to be dismissive of their first few albums, which were thoughtful without being mushy or maudlin, but their three recent records-- the underrated/overhated alleged-sellout <em>The Tipping Point</em>, the Def Jam-released tightly knit return to rawness <em>Game Theory</em>, and now <em>Rising Down</em>-- are so singularly focused on a kind of distilled, uninhibited <em>force</em> that it's now difficult to think of the Roots as anything but intelligently aggressive firebrands.</p><p>
    You don't throw on these albums if you want to chill out, and<em> Rising Down</em> does more than any of them to express, precisely and without compromise, a specifically African-American but increasingly universal strain of anxiety and frustration. A lot of <em>Rising Down</em>'s urgency and immediacy owes to the massive guest roster<em></em>. The Roots' Philly core of affiliates-- vets Dice Raw, Peedi Peedi, and Truck North, former member Malik B., and relative newcomer/search engine nightmare P.O.R.N.-- appear on more than half the record's songs, and they help give the record a sense of a communal strength in numbers; their appearances on vicious throwdown ""Get Busy"" (with the some deft cuts from Philly's legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff) and a stretch of tracks in the middle (""I Will Not Apologize"", ""I Can't Help It"", and ""Singing Man"") feel like the spiritual and lyrical core of the album.</p><p>
    The guests from outside Philly work just as well: Talib Kweli spits with an atypically growly delivery on the anti-defeatist anthem ""Lost Desire"", Common displays glimpses of his late-1990s shine ruminating over tour fatigue on ""The Show"", Wale kills it with some so-corny-they're-great metaphors (""good rappers ain't eatin', they Olsen twinnin'"") on ""Rising Up"", and Saigon's final verse on ""Criminal"" is the fierce peak of a three-MC slow lyrical burn. And while Styles P's turn on the title track works well enough (it's something to hear the dude behind ""Good Times [I Get High]"" go after the pharmaceutical industry), Mos Def's verse-- the first one on the whole record-- is one of the best he's ever done, and probably the best guest spot on <em>Rising Down</em>: ""Identities in crisis and conflict diamonds/ Blindin', staring at lights till they cryin'/ Bone gristle popping from continuous grindin'.""</p><p>
    But despite the massive ensemble cast, Black Thought is still the core of the record and the well-worn accusations of him being anti-charismatic feel largely false here. Most of his great moments come on tracks which feature a lot of other MCs' great moments, and after getting overshadowed on ""Rising Down"" (can any MC make the subject of global warming into a dope lyric?) he comes out swinging for the rest of the record.  On ""Singing Man"", even with P.O.R.N. portraying himself as a vividly realized school shooter and Truck North putting together a disturbingly evocative characterization of a suicide bomber, Black Thought's depiction of an African child soldier justifying his violence (""13 year-old killer, he look 35/ He changed his name to Little No Man Survive"") is both sharply written and unsettling. His delivery is a bit more varied than you might expect, too, particularly when he's rapping about getting underpaid like he's got a clenched jaw in ""I Will Not Apologize"" or sweating his way through a pills-and-stress panic attack on ""I Can't Help It"". And when he's turned loose on a hookless lyrical exhibition, Black Thought is nearly unstoppable; it's scary the way he blazes through the one-take assault of ""75 Bars (Black's Reconstruction)"", throwing out endless Big Daddy Kane-level proclamations of untouchability (""My hustle is long, my muscle is strong, my man put the paper in the duffel I'm gone/ Y'all still a light year from the level I'm on/ Just a pawn stepping right into the head of the storm""). The abrupt way it ends, it sounds like he could've gone on full throttle for another two hundred bars if someone hadn't taken a cleaver to the tape reel.</p><p>
    A revamped production style accompanies the deeper, darker lyrical tone, taking the aesthetic of <em>Game Theory</em> to its grimiest conclusion. Most of Kamal's keyboard work here isn't with the archetypal Fender Rhodes of Roots albums past; he's using a number of grimy analog synths that snarl and spit and hiss, the kind you hear in dead prez's ""Hip Hop"" or Outkast's ""Stanklove"" (or the J.B.'s' ""Blow Your Head"", for that matter). That racket combining with ?uestlove's fierce, crisp percussion makes for some diabolical rhythmic low-end, and since it dominates <em>Rising Down</em>'s personality it gives the album the feeling of being this bionic monstrosity that just so happens to have a lot of headknock to it.</p><p>
    There are a couple of exceptions, like the guitar-driven midtempo Fela pastiche of ""I Will Not Apologize"" and the unexpected country-blues tinge to ""Criminal"", but they're rare breathers in an album that otherwise closes in on you. Only when the triumphant, old-school Roots return on the demi-go-go of ""Rising Up"" does it feel like the weight's been lifted, and even then something about it-- the endless Oprah/Travolta namedrop hook, the mawkish Chrisette Michele vocal about a crying b-girl, the overly tidy-sounding keyboards-- seems a bit out of place. (Maybe not as out-of-place as the now-infamous and super-creepy Patrick Stump collab ""Birthday Girl"", however; excising that disaster singlehandedly saved the album's character.) <em>Rising Down</em> isn't always an easy listen, but it's an exciting one, and its abrasiveness never gets in the way of a good throw-your-hands-up beat or a well-crafted lyric.</p><p>
    If you've been paying any damn attention to the world around you, most of <em>Rising Down</em>'s messages ring familiar, and frequently true: This is an album that tells you the entertainment industry is turning into a coon show, the climate (both environmental and cultural) is getting fucked up, and broke people are still struggling. But this record states these ideas with respect to the notion that you know them already, and puts all the revelation and subtext into its unyielding sound. You could call it preaching to the converted, but it also feels like a reminder to the lapsed, less a wake-up call than a shot of renewed adrenaline.</p></div>"|11458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11458-rising-down/|7.8|Nate Patrin

They stole brazenly from heroes of dinosaur rock while dressing down their idol culture in their lyrics and demeanor, and reconstructed their music to a desperate beat. It was enough to make you believe rock and roll was a dead horse worth flogging. Yet the band's third album, <em>Tournament of Hearts</em>, found the band tugged in a few different directions, one of which was unexpected ballad ""Soon Enough"". That track was an ode to finding fulfillment by merely living up to the responsibilities of adulthood; after all their former bluster, the introspection and maturity felt fully inhabited and earned. Now, however: Are you ready for nearly an entire album of that?</p><p>
    Well, almost a whole album: Opener ""Hard Feelings"" is as muscular and flailing as anything in the Constantines' catalog, but given the rest of the record, it seems like a capitulation to their old selves. The chorus of ""Million Star Hotel"" is slow and blustery, as if the band's jagged edges have been sanded off. ""Trans Canada"" starts with a keyboard pulse that's half train whistle, half trance anthem but its insistent chug leads to a full-band climax and the record's heaviest moment. Singer Bryan Webb has said ""Trans Canada"" was torn apart and rebuilt from scratch, and it reflects that, standing a few yards astride of the <em>Kensington Heights'</em> uniform tone while hitting the album's emotional peak. And while ""Our Age"" also nails a note of yearning, thanks to its stately melody and Webb's growth as a vocalist, the rest of the album seems weary and resigned.</p><p>
    Even at their fiercest, Constantines sounded liked bruised and battered romantics, so a slower, more world-weary album is a natural-- but maybe too comfortable-- choice. Though there's still some traces of pride and defiance to be found here, like on the weeping guitar bends of the simmering ""Time Can Be Overcome"", the second side of the record is especially troubling. ""Credit River"" is a jump (and face-plant) into topical waters where Webb sounds nearly too bored to finish the chorus and keyboardist Will Kidman, who added so much to earlier songs, smothers the track in gaudy, dated effects. Just as jarring is the album's closer, which marries manufactured catharsis with shrugging bathroom-wall slogans. Webb's glass-gargling voice can make him sound like the mouthpiece of the disenfranchised, but on ""Do What You Can Do"" he can't muster up anything insightful.
    </p><p>
    Maybe Constantines aren't just tired, but mortally afraid-- the specter of death that lingers over the city doctor of ""Million Star Hotel"" spreads to hospital rooms in the rootsier ""Brother Run Them Down""-- but without any of ""Hotel""'s tension. In the face of that mortality, Webb offers a cold shoulder to banner-waving and perpetual youth: ""You are not your generation."" No doubt that the best halves of this and <em>Tournament of Hearts</em> would equal a breakthrough album for the group, but taken as a whole, <em>Kensington Heights</em> sounds like a decisive break in the band's stride. What lingers after it's done, if not the songs, is how comfortably the group has slid into this lower gear.

    When confronted with Karl Blau's large and often excellent catalog, the inevitable question is: Why isn't this guy at least as well known as his musical cohorts Phil Elverum and Laura Veirs? It's easy to get on one's soapbox and suppose that people want mediocrity. I mean, how else are we to explain the success of a musical Steve Guttenberg such as M. Ward? One can argue that when it comes to music, the public tends to applaud a certain kind of consistency, with records that sound familiar. But that's of course a false dichotomy. And while none of us would easily deny fame and influence, some artists simply choose the roads less traveled (if I may be allowed to make a high school poetry reference rather than a grad school one).</p><p>
    Blau-- who's one-third of supertrio D+ (alongside Bret Lunsford from Beat Happening and the aforementioned Elverum) and who's worked with Mirah, Wolf Colonel, Nate Ashley, the Microphones, and Little Wings-- certainly seems more interested in winding backroads than interstates. The Anacortes, Wash.-based singer-songwriter is kind of like Kevin Ayers with a work ethic. A strong advocate for all-ages venues, his own monthly record service (Kelp!) sends CD-Rs and LPs directly to fans. He may re-record a Microphones album or collect field recordings. His entire shtick might be precious and trite if the work weren't also so straightforward and excellent.</p><p>
    Blau's delightful new record is called <em>AM</em>. Actually, it's not that new. Having originally released it in a more stripped-down form as a CD-R via his monthly record service Kelp! in late 2006, Blau started on this album after he finished work on 2006's <em>Beneath Waves</em>. ""As <em>B.W.</em> was a live with band album for the most part, I took some time to record by my lonesome,"" Blau explains via email. The album meanders from anxious and droney tunes such as the hurdy gurdy (or is that melodica?)-plus-guitar feedback opening number ""Morning Prayer"" to laid-back folksy groovers like the drawling last track, ""In the Morning"". The latter song has all of the charm of the least angsty and full-throated songs by Kurt Cobain. Speaking of the 1990s, ""Yellow Sunbonnet"" sounds like the drunken demo version of some forgotten grunge hit, while the playful xylophone on ""Growing Up"" sounds like Skip Spence doing a pop-punk tune backed by second graders.
    </p>
<p>
    I'm not sure if it qualifies as a concept album, but three of the songs on <em>AM</em> have the word ""morning"" in the title. And then two tunes have the word ""bird"" in the title, which is apparently something one hears if one is to awaken early, the sound of birds. I personally am a late riser, but I love the idea of the morning. So does Blau, who writes that ""<em>AM</em> was written and recorded in the wee hours of the day to reflect beginnings: spring, childhood, morning."" And <em>AM</em> has multiple meanings, too: ""I adopted and adapted several poems-- one paragraph actually from a Winnie the Pooh story-- by A.A. Milne. I was reading his work to my daughter at the time of recording this; it hit me that this was very much in the vein of what I was doing with the music.""
    </p>
<p>
    Again, this enterprise would be so fucking twee if almost anyone else did it. I hasten to add that it's entirely possible to listen to this without being aware of the song's origins. It's not like there's a cover of Loggins and Messina's ""House at Pooh Corner"" or anything. And musically, it owes no debts to either Belle or Sebastian. Instead, it's a messy experimental folk-pop album of songs recorded in the bedroom before the artist was fully awake. It's awesome.

Even at the relative height of its popularity, the Louisville-turned-Hoboken band turned heads with legendary live performances but didn't exactly raise the head count of its fans (poppy guitar freakout peers such as Yo La Tengo and Eleventh Dream Day included among them). As far as many of those fans were concerned, Antietam ended after 1994's slept-on <em>Rope-A-Dope</em>, and if the band in its heyday flew under the radar, that's nothing compared to the low profile of its 2004 comeback <em>Victory Park</em>.</p><p>
    Now Antietam have risen once again, and anyone clamoring for some classic indie-rock will be heartened by the arrival of <em>Opus Mixtum</em>, two-discs of new Antietam music recorded by the surprisingly stable trio of singer/guitar hero Tara Key, bassist Tim Harris, and drummer Josh Madell, the band's core since 1991. Yes, two discs, drawn from two separate sessions originally envisioned for two separate albums, one highlighting the band's softer side and the other its status as one of the great forgotten guitar shredders of the indie era.</p><p>
    Yet if there's a downside to Antietam's longevity, it's that at this stage in the game the band really doesn't have much to add to the conversation. Even at two discs, <em>Opus Mixtum</em> hardly overstays its welcome, but the degree of welcome it meets is likely linked to your preference for the familiar Neil Young-does-VU school of indie that ruled the underground in the 1980s. It's hardly a straight nostalgia trip, but at the same time Key, Harris, and Madell in 2008 aren't exactly pushing things forward.
    </p><p>
    That's not what Antietam are about, though. The band's not out to change the rules but raise the roof, and at its best <em>Opus Mixtum</em> accents the relative timelessness of Antietam's music. Songs like ""Shipshape"", ""Turn It on Me"", ""Pennants and Flags"", and ""That's the Way It Is"" would have earned a prime place on college radio in any era. One could even imagine a simple song like the instrumental ""Arrowhead Syrup"" or the rollicking ""Needle and the Eye"", sharpened with better production and beefed up with beaucoup marketing bucks, as leftfield alt-rock hits.
    </p>
<p>
    Admittedly, that's ""alt"" as in ""alternate-reality,"" as Antietam, accessible though they may be, recognize there's a place for their music and that place will always be under the radar. Modest expectations give the group great confidence when it comes to crafting its brand of indie meat and potatoes rock, as does the knowledge that jaws will drop when Antietam tear it up on-stage. Still, that confidence can only carry Antietam so far. Even the (superior) Eleventh Dream Day quickly hit a glass ceiling before settling for an Antietam-styled part-time existence.
    </p>
<p>
    Yet if the band is first and foremost about fretwork, feedback, and churning riffs, Antietam's mellower moments don't sound totally out of place. The cinematic strum of the instrumental ""Steel G"" seems all about the open road at sunset, while ""Red Balloon Waltz"" and ""The Gate Closed"" (both also instrumental) are no less evocative. ""Hasten"" substitutes the usual Antietam all-out dynamics with whispered vocals and trumpet. ""On the Humble"" bridges the Byrds with the VU, and ""Tierra del Fuego"" ends the album on a drifting, droning note, drawing out to nearly ten minutes of gentle folk and dubby effects. It makes you wonder whether <em>Opus Mixtum</em> might have been better separated into vocal and instrumental discs, the better to show off these two complementary sides of the band.

    Though Neptune have put out a lot of material over 12 years, the release of <em>Gong Lake</em>
    on experimental artists' haven Table of the Elements may net the band
    their widest exposure yet. Describing their records without mentioning
    the methods behind them, and the ensuing live spectacle, is hard to resist: On
    stage, they man heavy, foreboding instruments self-made from antiquated
    machines and scrap metal, forged at extreme angles like props from
    a German expressionist film. The band could never be reduced
    to simply performance art, though, and <em>Gong Lake</em> is just as rich in rhythm and
    atmosphere as any of their previous albums. Still, they remain primarily a
    live beast. Their sound is literally industrial, and it's way more fun
    to watch a factory bang shit out than just to hear it. Neptune still
    struggle with that, and even at their most song-oriented and cohesive,
    a Neptune record may always be an advertisement for their dramatic, otherworldly
    live shows.</p><p id=""jg-b10"">
    That said, <em>Gong Lake</em> makes for an exquisite flier. Considering the band's output on the whole, the songs on <em>Gong Lake</em>
    are comparatively discrete, and the dynamic shifts especially pronounced. Though lord knows what
    machine has been subverted to make the noise, many songs start from
    stretched, ominous tones that may as well be from keyboards, notably on
    songs like ""Copper Green"" where the band hangs several little noise
    fugues like tree ornaments on one central, icy one-note drone. Neptune
    do find occasions to add vocals, and any other texture is welcome with
    such unforgiving instrumentals. It's mostly a flat and ominous
    near-whisper on songs like ""Grey Shallows"", which doesn't add to the
    song so much as pull back the curtain a bit and disrupt their
    brutally mechanical groove. Vocals feel less like an afterthought
    on more simmering tracks like ""Black Tide"" and ""Yellow River"", adding
    to their seedy and ominous feel. More traditional strings (be they from
    baritone guitars or something more unusual) dominate songs like ""Paris
    Green"" and ""Blue Glass"", making them almost straightforward rockers. This is
    where more animated vocals struggle for some of the focus of the
    clattering rhythm and stunning drum performances; ""Yellow River""
    strikes a better balance, as voices add to the song's
    foreboding, nearly hip-hop groove.</p><p id=""jg-b10"">
    From
    the vocals that crib from the Vincent Price playbook to the
    creepy-crawly vibe of instrumentals like ""Red Sea"" and ""Purple Sleep"",
    these songs can be campy and fun just as often as they are oppressive,
    and can easily be both; there's just as much of the impish sound
    manipulation of pioneers like Raymond Scott as there is Einstürzende
    Neubauten. Either way, Neptune are formidable architects of sound,
    regardless of what they had to build to get there. While <em>Gong Lake</em>
    is more a refinement than a breakthrough, the record
    doesn't suggest stasis; rather, you wonder how what could have
    been a performance-art gimmick has sustained itself for 12 years without running out
    of inspiration or steam, and <em>Gong Lake</em> is a fine argument for them sticking around.

Our souls just wouldn't allow us. The South way has     always been to push boundaries and never record the same record twice.""     They certainly have the truth on their side: With a subtle     individuality, each of their previous four albums were more likely to     explore sonic texture than mawkish sentiment, but you have to wonder     whether the above statement is borne of stubbornness, pride or denial,     considering they're responsible for one of my most awkward concert     experiences-- at a 2004 show in Athens, Ga., they got blown off the     stage by an exponentially more energetic Metric and then proceeded to     limp through their set in front of what couldn't have been more than     two dozen Anglo diehards or alcoholics. Mind you, this was <i>after </i>""Paint The Silence"" was prominently featured on ""The O.C."", so I'm not sure if these guys really have the moral high ground.</p>
<p id=""lkic"">South still can't find their compass-- <i>You Are Here</i>, despite     being titled in a manner of directional certainty, mostly evokes the     momentary disorientation of seeing said phrase on a mall map. It's     easily their most raw and direct work to date, but that's a relative     concept for guys who've shared studio time with James Lavelle and Dave     Eringa. Crispy acoustic numbers like ""The Creeping"" and ""Better Things""     won't be confused for Bon Iver, but in the past, they'd likely be     dripping in synth pad strings or two additional minutes of breakbeats.     And yet, it's also South's most sonically damaged album as well, often     inspiring double and triple-checks of the credits to make sure Dave     Fridmann wasn't involved. He's not, so the next best guess is that     you've received an unfinished demo, as most of their tricks sound like     the work of my high school garage band buying its first digital     recorder-- a deluge of ideas, way too much technology, and no idea how     to use it.</p>
<p id=""ftpd"">Even though the EQing here often has these poor guys sounding like     they're pressed against a Plexiglas ceiling (the bass guitar might as     well be a timpani), vocalist Joel Cadbury is the big loser in all of     this; he's never been the most distinctive singer, sort of an Ian Brown     with additional shades of beige. But attempts to bedeck his papery tone     with color ends up in boundless self-sabotage. ""Wasted"" and ""Opened Up""     are occasionally gorgeous, featuring the sort of chiming delay notes,     capo-ed strumming, and crunchy percussion that evokes top-shelf Travis.     Yet, on the former, Cadbury is lashed by a sour flange effect that     renders the verses meaningless. The latter reverses, as it's the chorus     that sounds like the band's been transported to a studio trapped inside     a steaming tea kettle. ""She's Half Crazy"" is all mess, with Cadbury     either swimming in some backmasked brine or trying to play catch up     while the rest of the guys try out a sort of playful, funk groove that     proves South do neither playful nor funk.</p>
<p id=""elf8"">If it seems like I'm harping on the production too much, there's a     reason-- South have always been more of a cipher than anything, a sort     of blank slate where engineers can try out their more outré ideas     without having any sort of bold melody or strong lyrical gambit get in     the way (think of a British answer to Wheat). The latter's not so much     of a problem, as Cadbury rarely speaks in something other than     placeholder or platitude, which might be for the best, considering that     ""Lonely Highs"", the most topical moment of <i>You Are Here</i>, ends up one of the lamest anti-drug PSAs since Jimmy Eat World's ""Drugs or Me"".</p>
<p id=""vj7d"">But the insouciant ""Better Things"" (salvaged from 1999's obscure <i>Overused</i>)     manages to do mushy properly (""the better things look forward     to you""), as well as ""Every Light Has Blown"", which practically flicks     its own Bic with lines like ""I'll do my best to keep you safe."" Get the     hint? <i>You Are Here</i> ironically reaches its peaks as South lunges     towards the very influences they claim to so conscientiously avoid,     meaning this whole thing might not be a problem of production so much     as projection. South may be worried about selling out, but in the     process, they're selling themselves short.</p></div>"|11371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11371-you-are-here/|4.8|Ian Cohen

    Can an album really be a departure if it's the first thing a group's released in 11 years? It ideally would be for a genre-bound band turned brand name like Portishead: As much as there is to miss about the mid-late 1990s, the time for any trip-hop revival is far into the future, and picking up right where they left off in 1997 would make Portishead some kind of sad cipher coasting on the fumes of an exhausted trend-- something they've always been above. If the voice of Beth Gibbons wasn't so ingrained in the consciousness of a whole generation of indie kids, you could look at <em>Third </em>as a sort of re-debut; it posits that the sound of Portishead can actually exist even after the group excises every possible remnant of trip-hop from it.</p><p>
    As radical reinventions go, <em>Third</em> is surprisingly natural. You can credit Gibbons as the familiarizing factor: She possesses a voice that seems impossible to shackle to just one musical setting, even if it already sounds perfectly at home in brooding downtempo ambience. As the most recognizable component of the group, she has the most established stylistic tendencies-- subtle quivers, an ability to go from hushed to piercing without laboring over the transition, an aching timbre that expresses anxious vulnerability better than nearly any other singer-- and she slips back into them comfortably when she needs to.</p><p>
    But it's also a style that works in more contexts than we've previously heard, something she hinted at with Rustin Man on 2002's folk and jazz-influenced <em>Out of Season</em>, and <em>Third </em>is the culmination of this. Pitted against the jarring mechanical stop-starts of first single ""Machine Gun"" or the chase-scene-paced opener ""Silence"", Gibbons sounds like both a defiant accuser and someone clinging on for dear life. Quieter numbers, like the slow-build electronic ballad ""The Rip"" or the softer moments of the cabaret highwire act ""Hunter"", highlight the fragility in her voice. And since almost every song on <em>Third </em>addresses some sort of emotional or mental helplessness-- typically a deep and profound sense of loss and isolation-- it's almost as though this shift in sonic identity is there to mask the fact that this is an incredibly bleak record lyrically. Gibbons' wounded tone can take commonplace-on-paper sentiments (""I'd like to laugh at what you said but I just can't find a smile""; ""I can't deny what I've become/ I'm just emotionally undone"") and give them a kind of pathos that's almost uncomfortably voyeuristic to listen to. 
    </p>
<p>
    As for how the music itself has changed, long story short: <em>Third </em>is a psychedelic rock album. It opens with a rhythm that's nearly twice as fast as almost everything else Portishead have done, the percussion on most of the songs is frequently muffled or buried under layers of noise and sometimes just stops short of being non-existent (though it's heavy and propulsive when it does make itself known), and their keyboards and strings have graduated from relaxed tension into dissonant rumbles and shrieks. There's a brief acoustic folk song (""Deep Water""), an abrasive and jittery electro-industrial number (""Machine Gun""), free jazz horns (""Magic Doors""), analog freakouts from the United States of America-fueled early days of electronic psych (""The Rip""), and a song that sounds a bit like Clinic's droning, rhythmically dense garage-kraut, except somehow spookier (""We Carry On""). Portishead as you previously knew them are represented, barely, by the last song on the album-- the sleepwalk-paced, David Axelrod-esque ""Threads""-- and even then, its intermittently fuzzed-out tension-and-release dynamic would've made it one of the harshest-sounding songs on <em>Dummy </em>or <em>Portishead</em>.
    </p>
<p>
<span>You could say that this would be unrecognizable as a Portishead album without Gibbons' voice, and you'd be sort of right; guitarist and contributing songwriter Adrian Utley mentioned in a recent <em>New York Times</em> article that one of the rules they set for <em>Third </em>was that they couldn't fall back on any instruments-- or even any trademark sounds-- that they'd used on previous albums. But their style here isn't particularly out of character, comparatively experimental as it is; Utley's guitar still twangs sharply when it's not doing things like interjecting ""Iron Man"" growls in ""Hunter"" or splintering into Syd Barrett-isms at the coda of ""Small"", and the melodic identity that he and Geoff Barrow built on a foundation of minor keys and sinister grandeur still holds sway. In the terms of a group that was frequently lumped in with film composers as much as Bristol axis peers, Portishead's Euro-cool John Barry intrigue has been pushed into the disquieting territory of John Carpenter's compositions and Bernard Herrmann's Alfred Hitchcock scores.</span>
</p>
<p>
    Keep in mind just how out-of-nowhere this all seems: The notion of a new Portishead album had, for many fans, fallen out of the realm of possibility. If <em>Third</em> had come out in 1999 or 2000, maybe writers would be calling it Portishead's answer to Massive Attack's <em>Mezzanine</em>, another third album by trip-hop icons eschewing dinner-conversation music by embracing anxiety and moodiness. Released today, it instead feels like a staggering transformation and a return to form that was     never lost, an ideal adaptation by a group that many people didn't know they needed to hear again.

    Madonna is coming home: Having spent a decade working with producers drawn from European club culture, <em>Hard Candy</em> is her link-up with the American men who've come to define global pop. Five songs with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake, six with Pharrell Williams, one with Williams and Kanye West. The best, this line-up announces, need to work with the best. But lead single ""4 Minutes"" doesn't sound like the best working with the best: It sounds complacent, like a pop supergroup high-fivin' each other.</p><p>
    The ""4 Minutes"" marching band rhythm-riff may be Timbaland's strongest idea on the album but the performers seem happy to let it do the work. He keeps shouting for ""Mad-DON-nuh!"" but she's a guest on her own track, singing from the margins of what might as well be a Timberlake outtake. Timbaland's productions are the weaker links on this frustratingly ordinary album. Partly he's a victim of his own ubiquity-- we know his tricks by now: the interlocking rhythmic hooks on his upbeat tracks, the bubbling claustrophobia on his ballads. ""Devil Wouldn't Recognise You"" is the third time-- <em>at least</em>-- that he's written ""Cry Me a River"", right down to the moody rainstorm breakdown and thunderclaps. But his less-typical productions don't all work well here either: ""Dance 2Night"" aspires to 80s funk slickness but lumbers where it should cruise.</p><p>
    The 1980s, specifically Madonna's 80s, haunt <em>Hard Candy</em>: It's been touted as a return to the spirit and sound of her earliest work, but her voice and delivery have changed too much for the comparison to hold. Her vocal training and singing lessons in the 90s broadened her range but she's never sounded as hungry since, and her phrasing on <em>Hard Candy</em> is frequently dreadful-- words so evenly spaced and emphasized that it sounds like she's reading aloud to a class. Or teaching you the choruses: You won't get ""Miles Away"" out of your head in a hurry but that's less to do with its quality than the didactic way she delivers it. Her biggest misstep is ""Heartbeat""-- lyrics deliberately reminiscent of ""Into the Groove"" but sung so detached you might as well be at a Madonna Studies lecture.</p><p>
    The record's better tracks are, unsurprisingly, those where Madonna sounds more engaged. Second single ""Give It to Me"" has her delivering an imperious lesson on success and survival-- <em>""</em>Show me a record and I'll break it/ I can go on and on<em>""</em>-- over <em>Hard Candy</em>'s most urgent tune, hard-pushing electro-ska whose keyboards break up trying to keep pace. Closing track ""Voices"" is gorgeously gothic orchestral synth-pop that she seems to relax and revel in. Centerpiece ""She's Not Me"" is a stirring piece of turf-defense, prowling between Chic-era disco and modern pop-house as Madonna slaps down a rival. It's taut and cold, easily <em>Hard Candy</em>'s most emotionally compelling moment.</p><p>
    ""She's Not Me"" smoothly lays out Madonna's credentials: Twenty-five years at the top of the game. She doesn't reinvent pop; she defines it. Her strengths have always been her authority, and her smart sense of who to work with and when. So even if it's a summary of where pop's at rather than where it's going, <em>Hard Candy</em> should still be excellent. After all, if you're not going to do your best work for Madonna, who are you going to do it for? But after listening, the question's still open-- nobody involved in <em>Hard Candy</em> is anywhere near their creative peak.

    At this point in Carla Bozulich's career, an album stewing in this
    much unrefined emotional sludge is pretty surprising. Then again, with
    a résumé as expansive and convoluted as Bozulich's, there's little use
    in trying to plot out her next logical step, let alone identify what
    sort of creative stage, if any, you can consider her in right now. In a
    little over a quarter century, Bozulich's dabbled in such areas as
    industrial (Ethyl Meatplow), alt-country (the Geraldine Fibbers,
    Scarnella), elaborate performance art, and, on the 2003 re-imagining of <em>Red Headed Stranger</em>, even Willie Nelson. So, an avant-garde blues/metal/classical album dripping with bloody catharsis? Sure, why not?</p><p id=""o557"">
    ""Here's to St. Anne, who's gone mad"" sings Bozulich on the nearly a-rhythmic opener ""Winds of St. Anne"". On <em>Hello, Voyager</em>, Bozulich mines more from her 2006 solo album <em>Evangelista </em>than a new name for her new band. <em>Voyager </em>further explores the omnipresent female dementia of <em>Evangelista</em>,
    this time with an even fuller sound and an increasingly tortured
    performance from Bozulich. Nearly every track here occupies its own
    realm, tenuously connected by Bozulich's vocals or similar string
    arrangements but otherwise completely alien to each other. Nothing
    demonstrates this better than the cold shower effect of ""The Frozen
    Dress"", a post-rock instrumental wasteland, coming after the blistering
    two-minute stoner metal of de facto single ""Truth is Dark Like Outer
    Space"".</p><p id=""aa7v"">
    As the only American artist on Montreal label
    Constellation, Bozulich introduces touches of country and blues to the
    label's signature apocalyptic symphonies. Considering the popularity of
    Jonny Greenwood's recent <em>There Will Be Blood</em> score, there's
    probably no better time than now to juxtapose a grimy blues ballad
    like ""Lucky Lucky Luck"" with the chillingly out-of-tune violins of ""For
    the L'il Dudes"". However, <em>Voyager </em>doesn't simply run its
    listeners through a gauntlet of extremes. Bozulich provides flashes of
    her inner country songwriter, particularly on the surprisingly tender
    ""The Blue Room"". With a lead guitar imitating a dusty old music box,
    Bozulich herself waxes equally delicate, at least in comparison to <em>Voyager</em>'s
    darker, tortured narratives: ""So I fold you like a dead poem/ And stick
    you in a teacup/ With a crack in the broke-off handle.""
    </p>
<p id=""c-zw"">
    Despite these eclectic tracks, Bozulich doesn't just genre-surf for pleasure. <em>Voyager </em>gradually
    deposits its bitterness into the final two tracks, the epically bleak
    dirge ""Paper Kitten Claw"" and the title track, a twelve-minute
    evangelical tirade from hell. The latter in particular stands as the
    most memorable track here, even if its discombobulated cymbal crashes
    and call-and-response preaching would hit harder as live performance
    art. Of course, Evangelista make it pretty clear from the get-go that
    their artistic aims are not solely focused on recording songs in a
    studio. Rife with suspense, drama, and a grisly cast of characters, <em>Voyager</em>'s
    probably more likely to ignite your inner playwright than get your foot
    tapping, but it's still a cathartic rush all the same.

Post-rock, in particular, is now so abused and misused that it somehow covers
    Tortoise, Stereolab, Mogwai, and Mono.  In the 90s, the term
    originally described rock's subversion through its own tools.  Thus,
    guitars didn't have to rock or define riffs.  Vocals, if present,
    weren't the focus.  Songs didn't rely on verses and choruses.  Over
    time, this open system became a closed one.  Now post-rock is very much
    defined: instrumental rock with long songs.  If it's heavier, then the
    equally unhelpful ""post-metal"" applies.  Destruction of rock's template
    has only created another one; now hordes of sound- and look-alikes have ditched vocals and grown beards.</p><p>
    Still,
    variations exist, and Russian Circles have a distinctive one.  This
    Chicago trio is more compact and disciplined than its peers.  Whereas Mogwai
    are spiky and slightly oblique, Mono are purple-hearted and passionate,
    and Explosions in the Sky muck about in major key clouds, Russian
    Circles are efficiently precise.  Clean tones ring cleanly, but so do
    the dirty ones. The band is also willing to be overtly
    metal; riffs march with military precision.  Even sheets of sound are carefully painted, in contrast to, say, Mono's
    walls of weeping.  This tautness of delivery suggests another ""post"":
    post-punk.  In fact, guitarist Mike Sullivan's palette resembles that
    of U2's the Edge, but with an Isis fetish.</p><p>
    Such economy of motion yields stark beauty.  Sullivan favors hypnotic, clean-toned ostinatos reminiscent of Pink Floyd.  In ""Youngblood"",
    they're ominous; in ""Campaign"", they're winsome.  Even when distorted,
    these repeating figures are still tender.  ""Harper Lewis"" unfurls
    melodic spirals that recall prog-surfers the Mermen.  The organ-lit ""Xavii"" is practically Mazzy Star.  ""Verses"" takes the chord progression of ""With or Without You"", kicks out Bono, and erects a gleaming church.  Amid peers fond of obfuscation, such nakedness is startling. </p><p>
    It's
    also sleek, and a little cold.  The rolling 6/8 of ""Station"" is
    essentially Viking metal, evoking raised fists and frostbitten beards. 
    Sullivan's riffing is vigorous, but as the only guitarist, that's all
    he can do.  The riffs beg for vocals, melodies, some sort of top layer;
    instead they're just a robust foundation.  ""Harper Lewis"", too, is ripe
    for counterpoint, but instead presents melodies linearly.  The result
    feels muzzled.  Songs hint at going over-the-top, but they never do. 
    This can be tasteful, of course; the drumming in ""Station"" is
    astonishingly tasty.  But if songs beg for vocals, they're no
    longer post-rock, but rock.  Post-rock's forte is letting instruments speak
    for vocals.  Russian Circles speak articulately, but could stand to roar
    a bit.<br/></p></div>"|11432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11432-station/|6.9|Cosmo Lee

Due to its laughable bombast and over-the-top violence, its influence on contemporary culture has emerged mainly in dark comedies like <em>Sweeney Todd</em> or ""South Park"", and many Shakespeare scholars still balk at seriously analyzing the work. Of course, all these factors make the play a perfect moniker for an indie band as violent, overblown, and irreverent as Glen Rock, New Jersey's Titus Andronicus.</p><p>
    Despite its title's implied politeness, <em>The Airing of Grievances</em> qualifies more as existentialism wrapped in an anti-suburban screed. Frontman Patrick Stickles howls with anguish way beyond his 22 years, often cramming lyrics into tight spaces just to make sure he gets the last word in. Plus, as anyone who's heard five seconds of this band already knows, he sounds like Conor Oberst screaming from the bowels of hell. However, to peg these guys as ""emo"" would be sadly inaccurate. Sure, torn diary page scribbles clutter <em>Airing</em>'s heart-on-sleeve, fist-in-air anthems, but the drama's more Boss than Bright Eyes, fueled by blue collar frustration and, most notably, beer.</p><p>
    So far Titus's rowdy live shows have generated the most buzz around the group; check your local listings, they're probably playing in a friend's tool shed near you. Those small venue acoustics translate wonderfully on the band's debut, its muffled mixing reminiscent of listening to a bar band from the men's room. Yet this inebriated aesthetic only intensifies the literary streak running through Stickles' easily excitable veins. A brusque ""fuck you!"" cues the band on Pogues-like opener ""Fear &amp; Loathing in Mahwah, NJ"", but once the rubble clears it's a villainous quote from <em>Titus Andronicus</em>'s Aaron the Moor that most elegantly expresses Stickles' bile: ""I have done a thousand dreadful things/ ...And nothing grieves me heartily indeed/ But that I cannot do ten thousand more."" As if the dreary title and playful, mock-optimistic guitar riffs of ""No Future Part II: The Day After No Future"" aren't enough to wrench your soul, the song ends with the closing passage from Albert Camus' <em>The Stranger</em>, in which the narrator wishes to be jeered by a large crowd on the day of his execution.</p><p>
    Of course, none of these highfalutin' shout-outs will grab your ear as powerfully as the demonic E Street Band arrangements, rife with constant builds and breakneck rhythms. Nearly every track here starts innocently, usually with a straightforward eighth-note strum or folksy melody unaware of the beating it's about to go through. Whereas a band like Arcade Fire likes to gradually crescendo to enhance the dramatic oomph, Titus can't enjoy that luxury-- not when Stickles is already screaming by the second lyric. Fortunately the band finds unconventional ways to heighten its music, like ""Arms Against Atrophy"", which waits three-quarters of its duration to unveil a killer, song-altering guitar riff, or the outro on ""Upon Viewing Brughel's 'Landscape with the Fall of Icarus'"", when the band corrals a maelstrom of stop-start solos into a steady, almost rockabilly groove.</p><p>
    Three-minute war cry ""Titus Andronicus"" best encapsulates <em>Airing</em>'s pathos, and serves as a fitting primer for an otherwise hefty and (initially) inscrutable album. Bemoaning the creativity-crushing effects of his environs (""I'll write my masterpiece some other day""), Stickles imagines a conformist nightmare of no sex, no booze, and no cigarettes, blurting ""fuck everything, fuck me"" in between two verses just for effect. As <em>Airing</em>'s most memorable moment, the song's taunting chorus maxim ""Your life is over!"" becomes to these guys what ""In the name of love!"" was for early U2. On a lyric sheet, Titus Andronicus may appear to espouse the sort of wrist-cutting histrionics emo's typically lambasted for, but the magic lies in the band's oddly enthusiastic grass roots delivery. They've studied their philosophy and found that life actually <em>is </em>pointless, so why not go down swinging?</p></div>"|11202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11202-the-airing-of-grievances/|8.5|Adam Moerder

Such as: Fuck the Doors. This is the truer sound of late-1960s Los Angeles, which was neither a trippy paradise nor a Lizard Kingdom, but a purgatory characterized by paranoia and grievance. Already veterans of the local scene when they released their third and best album, Love captured the city in all its grizzled glory on <i>Forever Changes</i>-- or, rather, Arthur Lee did. A charismatic black singer/songwriter in a mixed-race band but a generally white scene, he had soured on the hippies and sunshine mentality, and instead saw the Vietnam War, his friends' drug addictions, and the end of the world. Sequestered in a house high in the Hollywood hills, he could look down at the city below and nurse a curious dread. Eventually, he became convinced that his death was looming and that <i>Forever Changes</i> would be his final statement to the world. So he became a rank perfectionist, expressing all his unhappiness, fear, blame, and hope not only in his dark, discomfiting lyrics, but in the music itself, which draws from rock, pyschedelia, folk, pop, classical, and even mariachi. Ultimately, the album belongs to none of those genres.</p>
<p>That's certainly a compelling story, but it also points to a larger anti-story, one specifically bound to Los Angeles during the late 1960s. In her essay ""The White Album"", Joan Didion experienced a similar detachment from the world around her, piecing together fragments of scenes with the Doors, an interview with Manson girl Linda Kasabian, transcripts from the Ferguson brothers murder trial, and vivid descriptions of her own brittle mental state. <i>""</i>I was supposed to have a script, and had mislaid it,"" she writes. ""I was supposed to hear cues, and no longer did. I was meant to know the plot, but all I knew was what I saw: flash pictures in variable sequence, images with no 'meaning' beyond their temporary arrangement, not a movie but a cutting-room experience.""<i> Forever Changes</i> is similarly a thicket of tangled story threads, which of course shows in Lee's lyrics. Has rock music produced a stranger, more alarming cry for help than ""Sitting on a hillside, watching all the people die/ I'll feel much better on the other side""? Lee sings those lyrics on ""The Red Telephone"", and the calm in his voice, the matter-of-factness with which he delivers those lines, makes them the more worrisome.</p>
<p>Lee's faltering grasp on any  overriding narrative, however, comes through more strongly in the shape of the music, which is diverse and logical, but tricky-- full of feints, blind alleys, unusual passages. The traditional structures that served the band so well on its two previous albums (Love even covered Bacharach-David) are jettisoned in favor of more circuitous arrangements like ""A House Is Not a Motel"", which moves linearly, but repeats almost nothing. Even the most direct, lucid songs convey a sense of vague menace, the first sight of the storm out to sea. ""Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale"", perhaps the catchiest song here, surveys Los Angeles' music scene from Lee's perspective as he seems to bid conspicuous farewells to the venues and audiences. There's an acceptance and perhaps even a relief in his resignation: Listen to Lee sing along with the trumpet solo, his excitement driving and driven by the music.</p>
<p><i>Forever Changes</i> is both context and text, but none of it is academic. It's a rock album and, despite its tangles of meaning, a surprisingly accessible and enduring one. Nevertheless, as amazing as these songs are, this particular edition of <i>Forever Changes</i> is definitive only by default. Its similarities to the 2001 edition suggest an obligatory undertaking, offering few revelations about the album or the musicians who made it. The new liner notes were written by Andrew Sandoval, who produced the previous edition and contributed a short introduction. His access to the band members is valuable (he interviewed Lee many times before the singer's death in 2006), but he seems more interested in detailing the creation of the record than in exploring what it means or why it persists. The bulk of the bonus material consists of an alternate mix of the album, which pushes Lee's vocals to the forefront, deviates occasionally from the well-known stereo version, and generally recalls those Elektra anniversary editions of Love's previous albums. Otherwise, six of the 10 new bonus tracks appear on the original reissue, while one track is noticeably absent. Several are tracking sessions, full of count offs, false starts, and abrupt stops. This is by definition for-fans-only material. The only real discovery is their lackadaisical take on ""Wooly Bully"", which begins and ends so unceremoniously that it sounds wholly improvised, the byproduct of too much downtime in the studio.</p>
<p>Of the two, this new edition is superior to the 2001 one if only because it relegates all the bonus material to a separate disc and presents the full album by itself on the first disc. The well-earned valedictory ""You Set the Scene"" closes <i>Forever Changes</i> as intended instead of leading into outtakes. On the other hand, this Collector's Edition lacks the impact of the 2001 version, which rescued the then out-of-print album and introduced it to new legions of listeners. In retrospect, however, timing may have been the most crucial aspect of that release, considering the events of 2001 and the outrage that has simmered since then. Inspired by the 1960s, <i>Forever Changes</i> may actually be the perfect soundtrack to the 2000s, when the stories we tell ourselves in order to live began to make even less sense. To say that Love's music has lost none of its power is beside the point: It has actually gained new gravity, as Lee's paranoia, far from unwarranted, has become frighteningly easy to identify with.</p></div>"|11429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11429-forever-changes-collectors-edition/|8.6|Stephen M.

    There's historical poetry-- and plain shoe-fitting sense-- to Merge's rerelease of Wye Oak's 2007 debut, <em>If Children</em>. The band, a male-female duo from Baltimore, both in their early 20s, is like a Merge incarnate birthed 10 years late: mixed-sex; Mid-Atlantic; pretty without sounding porcelain. Their sound-- earnest folk-influenced indie rock with touches of noise and dream-pop-- is so second-nature that nobody realizes it's actually endangered. In 1995, <em>If Children</em> would've been vernacular, slotting on modern-rock radio next to Belly or sellable Dinosaur Jr.; in 2008, it flashes like lost slang. <br/></p><p>
    That's not to say <em>If Children</em> earns stripes from nostalgia. It doesn't. But it is refreshing that, in an era where the most promising indie rock bands operate through self-consciousness, flair, and fashion (LCD Soundsystem; modern Merge cash cows Spoon and Arcade Fire) or the equally hip pretense of eschewing those things (Animal Collective), Jenn Wasner and Andy Stack remove themselves from the discourse entirely. They aren't fashionable or sexy, but don't wear humility for a pity vote; they're earnest without expecting a pat on the back for it.</p><p>
<em>If Children</em> blends together in concept, but displays a band that knows how to vary a theme just enough to keep momentum: the restrained, porch-lit fingerpicking of ""Please Concrete"" gives way to cosmopolitan poses of free-jazzy squall; later, gliding Asian-sounding pentatonic runs on a piano during ""Keeping Company"" transition to the country-ish ""A Lawn to Mow"". Vocals trade between Wasner and Stack; her voice bears more sweetness, but the light variety is a palette cleanser. Their total defiance of novelty is almost minimalistic; it's a reminder that someone who understands food can make a good dish with three or four ingredients. </p><p>
    Wye Oak isn't gripping song after song-- too uncouth, too flashy-- but moments on <em>If Children</em> are superlative. ""Warning"" is a collision of momentums, the inherent slowness of guitar atmosphere with drums sputtering out from a garage-rock song. The catch is that Wasner and Stack actually sound comfortable in both modes; their fuzz convincingly dizzy, their inertia reckless. A humble rollercoaster. I might even prefer the grandeur of ""I Don't Feel Young"", which foams to actual noise without losing any sweetness; the Byrds without acid or English shoegaze without the suggestion of French kissing. </p><p>
    At the heart of both songs is bulletproof innocence. But Wye Oak aren't separatists or daydreamers; they're absolutely uncute. When Wasner sings ""I don't feel young, I don't feel scared"" she sounds saucer-eyed and terrified; when Stack joins her at the song's climax on the lines ""If you feel young and feel ready/ Or if you feel old...You know your secret's safe with me,"" their appeal to inclusion is wise enough to heed and comforting enough to cry into; when, on ""Warning"", she confides, ""The only hell I'll ever know is when you may go and I may not go,"" she doesn't flinch. It's not an appeal to be pet, it's a glass of water in the face, honesty so undramatized it's hard to imagine, at the moment, another band so achingly stupid, so brave at heart. <br/>

    the suspense: listening to Experimental
    Dental School
    is indeed kind of like pulling teeth. That's not a 25-word dismissal, however: XDS
    revel in the difficult, the turgid, the painful. They've been called dance
    rock, but that isn't quite the right term for this Oakland trio-- ""shake rock"" might
    be more appropriate for their new album <em>Jane
    Doe Loves Me</em>, or maybe ""seizure rock."" Chaotic, constantly
    shifting rhythms teeter around, punctuated by furious organ lines, machine-gun
    samples, stutter-start flares from Jesse Hall's custom ""guitar-o-bass,""
    and gleefully shouted lyrical one-liners. Ryan Brundage's drum fiery drum work
    keeps the band on pace through their many time-signature shifts, bouncing from
    4/4 to 3/4 to 12/8 to 13/8 with the fluidity of the hard prog the band seems to idolize.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The group skittered to a start, releasing <em>Hideous Dance Attack!!!</em>, also
    aptly-named, in 2003. Moving at a breakneck pace, <em>Attack!!!</em> took a page from fellow cross-Bay San Francisco
    contemporaries Deerhoof, except where Deerhoof make delicate use of space
    between instruments in the mix, XDS fill that space with a cacophony of
    furiously plonked organ riffs and busy drum fills.<em> Jane Doe Loves Me</em>
    is the group's third album and its most varied. The band's MySpace claims they spent 10 times on the album than on their previous two, and at times
    it shows. ""Whale Drone"" combines the jarring psychedelia of other
    conceptual cousins, Oneida
    and Captain Beefheart, with a buzzing duo of guitar-o-bass lines intertwining
    with a festive, swinging drumbeat. ""Uh Huh – Na Uh"" might even sound like a
    catchy psych-pop ballad, if it weren't for the synthesized screech bubbling
    under Horikawa's vocals. But too often, their offbeat identity gets the better
    of them. The grating juxtaposition of Horikawa's high-pitched organ with Hall's
    muddy guitar regularly dissolves into a messy homogeny, with only the aforementioned changes of pace acting as
    delimiters. All those rhythm changes and noises sound more busy than complex.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Listeners can often take or leave music of XDS's ilk while
    appreciating its merits, but good noisy rock sounds
    aggressive without fronting like it's <em>trying</em>
    to be noisy. Certainly Deerhoof and their obtuse
    compositions have earned a fair-sized audience. At their best (as on the opener ""Jane Doe Loves Me""), Experimental Dental School
    make use of every weapon in their varied arsenal but bring a sort of sonic
    order from the mined battlefield of the mixing board. But more often, XDS
    always seem to teeter between the abyss of random noise for noise's sake, and
    the relative safety of tight, visceral aggression. Their inability to meld the
    two in more convincing fashion makes them far more attractive in concept than on the stereo.</p></div>"|11431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11431-jane-doe-loves-me/|4.8|Mike Orme

    ""I Don't Always Know What You're Saying"", the first track on Ladyhawk's sophomore album, <em>Shots</em>, opens with a pot-banging guitar riff and a cascading, swooping noise whose origins-- effected guitar? synth?-- are indeterminate. Fitting with its title, the song offers what are possibly the only moments of uncertainty, sonically or emotionally, on the entire album. <em>Shots</em>, befitting Ladyhawk's reputation, is no-frills guitar rock that takes clear stances on relationships (confusing!) and guitars (good!). Still, it's hard to put the Vancouver quartet in a box: Ladyhawk look the part of brawny Americana rock revivalists, but at no point does <em>Shots</em> fulfill even the most liberal stylistic requirements of folk or blues or country. There's too much jaunt and bounce for proper hard rock; power-pop might work if the whole thing weren't so…turgid. Grunge-- and, make no mistake, not ""neo-grunge"" nor ""post-grunge"" nor ""ironic-grunge""-- probably best encapsulates the band's over-arching sort-of-ness.</p><p>
    Talking about what Ladyhawk are is a lot less interesting that discussing what holds them back: namely, their proclivity for Paul Bunyan-big, capital-R rock moments, with solos and crashing cymbals and howled vocals, or, more specifically, their need to tether those moments to their slowest and clumsiest songcraft. <em>Shots</em> opens with a trio of pop-rockers of such propulsion and grit that best-case-scenario thoughts start popping up: holy hell Ladyhawk might be Sugar! At their best, Ladyhawk share Sugar's penchant for crafting hooks around vanilla sentiment; that ""Fear""'s chorus is inescapable hardly lends any extra weight to frontman Duffy Driediger's refrain, ""I just wanna feel something other than fear/ I don't wanna go back but I can't stay here."" The unfortunately brief ""S.T.H.D."" might've been a sneak preview of the new Wolf Parade album but Driediger never lets the melody jerk out of his jaw, so it stays the best two minutes of 1980s punk Ladyhawk have ever put to tape. This familiarity, weirdly enough, breeds excitement: we know Ladyhawk are not new, but they might yet be a welcome brand of old.</p><p>
    After the surprising opening salvo, however, <em>Shots</em> clumsily bogs down in its desire to be big and rocking, even though any time Ladyhawk can be bothered to push the tempo-- the latter moments of ""(I'll Be Your) Ashtray"", the once again too short ""You Ran""-- they gnash and spit gloriously. As for the rest of it: no thanks on the yawn-y ""Corpse Paint"" and the woebegone lyricism of ""Faces of Death"" (""There's no such thing as endless love/ Only a joke told in very poor taste/ That somehow keeps cracking me up""). Driediger has an unfortunate knack for these blocky, teenage phrases; the big poetic moment of ""Ashtray"" goes as follows: ""I'll be your ashtray/ If you need me/ ‘Cause I only wanna feel you burnin'."" Then there's closer ""Ghost Blues"", functionally no different from any other Ladyhawk song save for the fact that it is 10 minutes long and features a handful of guitar solos. Ladyhawk's not the first band to backload an album with an epic or two, but ""Ghost Blues""' random appointment as such leads to the uncomfortable notion that by me having written this review and you having read it, we have both thought harder about Ladyhawk's art than Ladyhawk.  
    </p>
<p>
    Perhaps <em>Shots</em> needs to be interpreted not as violent outbursts but rather as uncertain scatter: attempts. Ladyhawk aim squarely for the middle-– at least the middle of muscular guitar rock-– but they find plenty of potholes to make the ride seem bumpy. <em>Shots</em> is like any stretch of pocked road, though: the smoothest stretches are the shortest.

Before the big swoon, it was tough to justify a reissue without a remaster, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and so lately, we've seen an increasing spate of albums re-released for no other reason than a round-number anniversary. In the cases of your <em>Thriller</em>s and your <em>Pet Sounds</em>, that's a justifiable enough benchmark-- in a way, those reissues provide the platform to talk about us and how much <em>we've</em> changed as much as the music. Something like the new deluxe edition of Air's <em>Moon Safari</em>, though, is a slightly trickier proposition.</p><p>
    For starters: There's the niggling question of whether Air's debut, superb as it is, really merits canonical treatment. As a collection of songs, it's endured well enough over time; after a decade, it still holds up fine. But so have a ton of other similarly acclaimed and successful records from 1998, and it doesn't seem remotely appropriate to roll out the red carpet for those either. As far as modern connect points go, there's nothing really happening musically at the moment that makes <em>Moon Safari </em>suddenly worthy of re-examination. If anything, with its dainty sonics and polite arpeggios, a lot of this record runs counter to the discofied and Balearic dance that's currently in fashion. Even Air would quickly abandon the cultivated library music aesthetic that characterized this record in favor of spindlier, more complicated, more sinister material. So yeah: As a snapshot of a place in time, you could do a lot worse than <em>Moon Safari</em>. But as something to be canonized in a three-disc set? The physics are lost on me. What, aside from the poetry of the number 10, is the exact reason to celebrate it now?</p><p>
    Granted, it probably wasn't Air's idea to do this, and it's certainly not their fault that <em>Moon Safari</em>'s legacy ultimately yielded a long list of bands along the lines of Lemon Jelly, Zero 7, Morcheeba, and Thievery Corporation, so perhaps it's fairer just to concentrate on what this reissue offers rather than the reason for it. The answer there, unfortunately, is: mixed returns. Although a robust collection featuring the original album, a disc of bonuses and B-sides, and a DVD featuring Mike Mills' 1999 tourfilm <em>Eating, Sleeping, Waiting and Playing</em>, this reissue doesn't offer nearly enough in the way of substantive bonus material to warrant its existence, nor does it even select the right material from that era to re-package.</p><p>
    The bonus disc is the biggest indicator of the lack of quality control or thoughtfulness on hand: instead of material from the duo's excellent surrounding EPs, <em>Le Soleil Est Près De Moi</em> and the singles compilation <em>Premiers Symptômes</em> (a lot of which could actually benefit from having a light shone on it), we get five live tracks-- including a horrible, thrashy version of ""Kelly Watch the Stars""-- which expose Air's live approach early on as light on musicianship and heavy on grating affectation and kitsch. Of the remaining demos and remixes, only the two-minute long, string-heavy take on ""Remember"" (itself a resurrected B-side) and a sparse demo of ""You Make It Easy"" (from when it was an instrumental called ""Bossa 96"") are remotely illuminating. Everything else just feels incidental and reheated.</p><p>
    Provided you like your filmmaking mannered and slightly cutesy, Mills' documentary remains a worthwhile curiosity, but even still, I can't imagine that anyone who'd be willing to shell out the money for a <em>Moon Safari</em> 10th Anniversary Edition wouldn't be acquainted with it already. Aside from that, you're basically paying for the packaging; in this case, that means a DVD-sized hardcover package with a nice, if slightly unnecessary, lyrics book attached. As a case for <em>Moon Safari</em> as a classic record, it falls a little short. But as a nice keepsake of a lovely record, it could be worse. I guess in the end it's really just a matter of whether you're fanatical enough about this album to buy it again. Virgin's either betting (or hoping) that enough of you are.</p></div>"|11442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11442-moon-safari-10th-anniversary-edition/|5.6|Mark Pytlik

Pt. 2|30073.0|Prodigy|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Voxonic']|2008-04-24 00:00:00|2008|2016-06-11 19:26:18.520084|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1if8c7entog.1.6:0.1.0.$11444/=1$11444.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Prodigy's 2007 album <em>Return of the Mac</em> was a leftfield triumph, the work of a rapper everyone had counted out reconnecting with everything that was great about him in the first place. As half of the bloody-minded Queensbridge duo Mobb Deep, Prodigy had come off a losing streak at least a half-decade long. He'd been dissed by Jay-Z, signed to G-Unit and released a flop of an attempted comeback, and saw crossover attempt after crossover attempt go nowhere. But with <em>Return of the Mac</em>, he and producer Alchemist dove into their stashes of 1970s blaxploitation-flick soundtracks and came up with a stark and grimy revivalist movie, a cinematic fever-dream memory of the old, gritty New York. In a bad year for rap, it was a cause for celebration.</p><p>
    It'd be great to say that <em>Return of the Mac</em> triggered a creative revitalization in Prodigy, but the past year has seen the man's life devolve into chaos, which positively bleeds through <em>H.N.I.C. Pt. 2</em>. <em>Return of the Mac</em> was originally intended as a mixtape teaser for <em>H.N.I.C. Pt. 2</em>, P's long-awaited sequel to his 2000 solo debut. By the time he got around to recording that sequel, though, Prodigy was staring down a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for gun possession, a term he's since started. Before Prodigy began serving his time, though, he reportedly recorded scratchy YouTube videos for every song on the album, signed a record deal with the translation-tech startup Voxonic, and started writing cryptically self-aggrandizing and weirdly addictive all-caps blog entries. (From his list of trends that he started: ""#5 HOW I FOLD MY BANDANA,"" ""#9 SAMPLING MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE SCARFACE,,,,,NOBODY DID IT BEFORE ME..NOT THE MUSIC"").</p><p>
<em>
    H.N.I.C. Pt. 2</em> isn't like Beanie Sigel's <em>The B.Coming</em>, another album made by a rapper about to start a prison term. <em>The B.Coming</em> was a bitter lament, a recording of someone taking stock of his life and dwelling on his mistakes. By contrast, <em>H.N.I.C. Pt. 2</em> finds Prodigy tangled in confusion, sounding like he's rapping through a haze of self-prescribed medication. As a rapper, P's never sounded more detached. He mutters out of the side of his mouth, barely noticing the beat. Nearly half the time, his words don't even come close to rhyming, and we get a lot of couplets like this: ""Don't be mad at me, be mad at yourself/ For being so garbage you need to be killed."" Most of his lyrics are either violent threats or conspiracy theories, but the threats have lost the vivid specificity of the vintage <em>Infamous</em>-era Mobb days and the theories usually straight-up don't make sense: ""They lit the Pentagon on fire/ That's lighting a pentagram on fire."" He contradicts himself all the time, saying on the first song that money and jewelry don't matter and then threatening to break your cheekbone with his platinum rings one track later. But there's still something absolutely magnetic about that voice: a weathered, craggy under-the-breath rasp. And there's something deeply poignant in the way he uses it on this album. It's like the tumult of his life has him so distracted and beat down that his words naturally come out all punch-drunk and half-hearted. In that way, <em>H.N.I.C. Pt. 2 </em>makes for a much more complete and visceral portrait of an incarcerated man than the most precise and technically sound record could possibly manage.</p><p>
    Musically, <em>H.N.I.C. Pt. 2</em> grants P's travails an epic dignity. Alchemist is on board again; he and Brooklyn's Sid Roams (two dudes, weirdly) produce the bulk of the album. But instead of the washed-out soul-samples of <em>Return of the Mac,</em> Alchemist and Sid Roams favor spare, eerie drums and streaky, evocative John Carpenter synths, almost giving a restrained East Coast boom-bap answer to the gothic horror-movie bounce of DJ Paul and Juicy J. Sometimes they distress Prodigy's voice, running it through filters so he sounds like he's rapping over a bad phone connection. And we get a few cameos from Mobb associates like the competently heated Big Noyd and the terrifyingly guttural RBX clone Big Twins (one dude, weirdly). Prodigy sounds absolutely at home in all this, his haunted husk sinking easily into these tracks and playing off his guests with grim authority. The Prodigy of <em>H.N.I.C Pt. 2</em> isn't depressed; he's as defiant and strange as always. He'll be OK.</p></div>"|11444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11444-hnic-pt-2/|7.8|Tom Breihan

    Billy Bragg's been called many things-- bard, busker, bloke, Bolshevik-- but ever since his auspicious emergence into the British punk scene, a folkie wielding an electric guitar, he's remained remarkably true to his roots. Bragg's the missing link between Woody Guthrie and Joe Strummer, and anyone who's seen him perform in recent years knows he retains the power to move and inspire. He gives you hope, and it's a testament to his songs that while the context has shifted-- wither Reagan/Thatcher, welcome Bush/Blair (and later Brown)-- his music still makes you want to storm the gates.</p><p>
    Obviously a lot has happened since Bragg's last album, 2002's <em>England, Half-English</em>-- not least the enduring Iraq war and the soul-crushingly sloppy prosecution of the so-called war on terror. But anyone expecting Bragg to rise to the occasion when he's arguably needed the most may be disappointed by <em>Mr. Love &amp; Justice</em>. In 2008, as the world goes to shit, Bragg has countered the pervasive bad vibes with an album of love songs. Mostly.</p><p>
    Not that Bragg has given up the fight. Hardly. He's spent much of the
    gap between records writing books (""The Progressive Patriot""),
    reissuing his back catalog, and founding Jail Guitar Doors, a musical
    education program for British inmates. In the meantime, he's kept
    gigging like a kid half his age, fueled with the same fervor and
    idealism that still propels Pete Seeger to pick up his banjo whenever
    he hears the call of a cause in need of his help and support. But on <em>Mr. Love &amp; Justice</em>, he comes off rather staid, if never less than solid.
    </p>
<p>
    Granted, songs like the soulful ""I Keep Faith"" (featuring fellow rabble rouser Robert Wyatt on backing vocals) and ""You Make Me Brave"" are as lovely as they come. The latter in particular, plus the dramatic ""Something Happened"" and the new Bragg classic ""I Almost Killed You"", seem tailor made, lyrics and all, for a hopeless romantic with better
    pipes than Bragg, someone like Morrissey. That's a compliment, as Bragg would likely be first to
    admit, and indeed much of his appeal still stems from his own modest
    abilities. Bragg's one of us, and sounds it, at least if you exclude his impressive songwriting abilities. </p><p>
    Moments of Bragg's trademark indignation are there, of course: ""Sing Their Souls Back Home"" is gospel by way of Barking, a tribute to the downtrodden and trod-upon-- and that includes, of course, the troops abroad. (""Bring em home now,"" declares Bragg, as if anyone had any doubt where he stood.) The cheeky but also a little cheesy ""The Johnny Carcinogentic Show"" takes aim at the marketing of toxins (both literal and metaphoric) to kids. The simple ""Farm Boy"" is sung from the perspective of a soldier stuck in a snafu of the military's doing, while ""O Freedom"" is as earnest as they come, a tale of extraordinary rendition delivered with melancholy fatalism.</p><p>
    It's understandable that Bragg may not want to be pigeonholed as a protest singer, but if it ever was the time to step up, it's now. Where's the outrage? Where's the anger? <em>Mr. Love &amp; Justice</em> isn't exactly the musical equivalent of dropping flowers down the barrels of rifles, but there is a certain passivity to the disc, a characteristic magnified by the rootsy approach of Bragg's trusty band the Blokes, who channel the bucolic bent of the Band rather than the edge of the Clash. It's a disc born of love when what the world needs is actually a little more justice.

Previous <em>Boogybytes</em> volumes have featured Allien pals Kiki, Sascha Funke, and Modeselektor controlling the decks; <em>Boogybytes Vol. 04</em> serves less as a proper introduction to Allien's upcoming LP <em>SOOL</em> and more as low-key reminder of Allien's peculiar artistic voice.</p><p>
    ""Controlling the decks"" is a becoming a bit of an anachronism for DJ mixes: Even though Allien hand-mixed <em>Fabric 34</em> she mans the keyboard for <em>Boogybytes Vol. 04</em>, stringing together 15 tracks, often for four or five minutes at a time. Allien mixes a little like you might twirl spaghetti onto a fork, locating one or two strands she likes and wrapping layer after layer. For most of <em>Boogybytes Vol. 04</em> she lays off kick drums or propulsive melodies in favor of glandular melodic thumps. When vocals are introduced-- as on the Damien Schwartz remix of Friendly People's ""Music Is Improper""-- it is in a very Allien-type mode: robotic phrases that add to the glitch and whir.</p><p>
    The mix then stays very consistent and very true to Allien's own strengths. She throws in the occasional monkeywrench-- the second half of Melon's ""Nitzi (In My Mind, So Fine)"" is a sly house rave-up and the wind-chime exotica of Lucio Aquilina's ""My Cube"" is a constant attention grabber-- but for the most part <em>Boogybytes Vol. 04</em> is stuffed with linear grooves that coil together naturally. Allien does well to stray from the obvious, making slyly left-field selections from the mix's higher profile artists. Melchior Productions' ""Don Juan"" saws and lurches like nothing on the recent <em>No Disco Future</em> but its tire-track bassline never stalls. Ricardo Villalobos makes an appearance with Patrick Ense on ""Fizpatrick"" which steers well clear of the tribal minimalism Villalobos is known for. Allien's decision to open and close the mix with slight ballads-- ""Liniendicke"" from <em>SOOL</em> producer AGF at the front end, Little Dragon's ""Twice"" to end-- is the set's most distinguishing characteristic.  </p><p>
    Despite the varied and intriguing selections, <em>Boogybytes Vol. 04</em> drags and rips, its sonic palette leaking out over the course of 66 minutes that feature too much suspension and too little build. Four minutes of Gaiser's icicle-pretty ""Withdrawal"" pass without event; six minutes quickly oscillating tones during Vera's ""In the Nook"" never stick, and it's the second track in the mix. Transitions often occur over such long passages that they are ""seamless"" almost by default; losing interest in what track is actually playing is not uncommon. Allien is a DJ of no small consequence, and there's no arguing with the sonics of <em>Boogybytes Vol. 04</em>-- they almost perfectly enunciate her tastes, interests, and collaborators-- but as a set, this mix is too much lock and not enough step.</p></div>"|11419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11419-boogybytes-vol-04/|6.1|Andrew Gaerig

From an international perspective, Kel Tamashek (aka Tuareg) rock and desert blues is young-- its first exposure outside of the refugee camps and temporary settlements it was born in came only this decade, though musicians had been honing the style since the early 1980s and circulating crudely recorded cassettes. As young as it may seem to the outside world, though,  Saharan blues is mature, ready to appropriate further influences and claim more territory.</p><p>
    For proof, look no further than Toumast, the latest Tamashek band to go international. Their sound is similar to the desert guitar standard-bearers Tinariwen, but beyond the immediate surface similarity, there's a lot of divergence. Toumast songwriter and guitarist Moussa Ag Keyna and his female cousin Aminatou Goumar formed the group in France, and as one can imagine, living in Paris puts many more sounds at your fingertips than living in the middle of the world's largest desert.</p><p>
<em>Ishumar</em>, named after a term used in West Africa to describe unemployed Kel Tamashek youths (it's a bastardization of the French ""chômeur""), takes the flowing guitars of Tinariwen and spikes them with rock dynamics, funky detours, and even a bit of jazz and hip-hop, all without losing the essence of the music that inspired it. Producer Dan Levy may have something to do with the album's eclectic arrangements as well-- his distinctive bass playing, with lots of melodic phrases, slides, and staccato phrasing, is a huge part of the sound of the record and very different from anything you'd hear on other Tamashek albums.
    </p><p>
    Levy also contributes kit drumming to a few songs, including ""Kik Ayittma"", (""Hey! My Brothers!""), which rises suddenly out of its meditative intro into a driving rock passage full of ragged lead guitar and a dexterous vocal from Moussa. He's singing a call to his fellow Kel Tamashek not to give up the cause of freedom, and it's a political cause he's sacrificed for himself. Moussa was wounded while fighting in the desert during the late-80s/early-90s uprising against the governments of Mali and Niger. His wounds, in fact, are what brought him to Paris. He was forced to give up fighting, but discovered he could aid his cause just as well through music.

    He and Aminatou, as a duo, can't conjure the same kinds of chants that traditionally deliver the lyrics in their culture's music, but they keep the same spirit, and Aminatou's occasional ululations add a piercing, electrifying accent to certain moments in the music. Together, they balance their musical heritage and their own progressive leanings deftly. Opener ""Ikalane Walegh"" (""These Countries That Are Not Mine"") is a reasonably faithful desert blues tune, with a swaying hand percussion anchor and a pared-down chant, but it saves room for a jazz-inflected sax solo that comes out of nowhere, like a rider over a dune. ""Tallyatidagh"" (""That Girl"") moves from shifting waves of guitar to a startling dance-rock section that seems to nod to Algerian raï. 
    </p>
<p>
    The most thrilling turn into another genre, though, comes on ""Maraou Oran"" (""For Twelve Moons""). It's initially a very good piece of desert blues, with a jumping rhythm and superb guitar/bass interplay, but after three minutes it unexpectedly veers into a fragmented, thumping hip-hop passage-- Moussa actually raps well (in Tamashek). It's a brief burst, but it puts a huge charge into the middle of the song, and it's amazing how naturally the passage fits. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Ishumar</em> is but a glimpse at the potential Tamashek guitar music has to mix freely with its counterparts while preserving its unique identity and singularly arresting qualities. In some ways, it's the album that could best serve as a gateway for fans of Western pop and rock into this music, given that it shares many of its dynamic sensibilities-- particularly contrasting sections-- with rock. More broadly, it's just a fantastic album that merits a spin by any half-way adventurous listener.

Sure, the punked-up 1980s cover trend is old-- must every band <span> </span>these day remake a hit from the Reagan era in their own American Apparel-clad image?-- and yes, any Gossip fan with access to a computer has probably already heard this track, as it has long been a British blogger favorite. But never mind. From its spare, throbbing-bass opening to super front woman Beth Ditto's soulful, wrenched delivery to its chugging conclusion, the song eschews the ironic wink and distanced posturing and infuses the song with the throttle and charisma that makes Gossip such a force. ""Careless Whisper"", as a result, has never sounded so raw: The song was always about regret, but something about George Michael's silky delivery and that hopelessly dated swooning saxophone gives it an air of elegant elevator muzak. As Ditto wails and Brace Paine's aggressive guitar stabs against Hannah Billie's four-on-the-floor stomp, they tear away all that was mannered about the original, leaving tears and sweat and propulsive dance rhythms in its place. Which, incidentally, is what the song is about in the first place. <span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Luckily, this collection, which was recorded at a show (duh) in Liverpool last summer, has more to offer than just that one great song. Its two covers-- ""Whisper"" and Aaliyah's ""Are You That Somebody?"", which proves that should Ditto tire of wearing the mantle of tough garage-punk goddess, she's got the pop chops and the dramatic delivery to be a melisma-drunk R&amp;B diva-- might be the highlights of this album. But the 11 originals, freed from the shackles of a recording studio, debut Gossip's sound as it has always been meant to be heard. Though the Oregon-via-Arkansas trio has released three studio albums over the past eight years, they have yet to capture the hot-blooded power of their muscular live sound on record. (They came closest on their previous live album, 2003's muddily recorded <i>Undead in NYC</i>.) This well-produced album attempts to remedy that and preserve their bluesy, blowzy show for posterity. Finally there's a sweat-and-beer-soaked alternative for those who always liked ""Standing in the Way of Control"" and ""Don't Make Waves"" but felt their studio incarnations were too clinical to capture the band’s overheated stage presence. (Want proof? Check the bonus DVD that comes packaged with this collection.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On Gossip's foray into dance-punk, <span> </span>2006's <i>Standing in the Way of Control</i>, Billie's cool drum precision often felt too aloof for Ditto's bloody wail, so hearing that album's songs (most notably, standout ""Yr Mangled Heart"") live is to hear the rhythm section match Ditto's <span> </span>level of fabulously messy agitation. There's not much stage banter here-- though Ditto does dedicate two songs to ""the faggots"" and ""the dykes"" respectively-- but this collection will still give listeners the feeling of being at one Gossip's concerts, complete with Joplin-esque vocal riffs, cathartic guitar bursts, and crowd singalongs (this was, afterall, recorded in England where Ditto is a much bigger <i>NME</i>-crowned star).</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are few women in music today with pipes like Ditto's and even fewer still that can pull off her level of vocal emoting without either sounding overwrought or needing a backing track. So a live album is a wise way for Gossip to introduce themselves to their new major label. It highlights their strengths (that voice, those beats, that authentic giving-it-their-all vibe) and hides their weaknesses (lack of songwriting breadth and dynamic diversity) making it sound like there's no place more fun than a Gossip concert, and no better host than Beth Ditto.</p></div>"|11427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11427-live-in-liverpool/|6.9|Rebecca Raber

It's hard to blame Spoon for fully soaking in the success of last year's sinewy <em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em> with non-stop tour dates, generous interviews, and now this eight-song EP. With the oddly named LP, Britt Daniel &amp; co. purified their less-is-more mantra like never before. Listening to the 36-minute exercise in economy, it seems like the bulk of recording time was spent deciding what elements to <em>take off</em> each svelte track-- a ballsy statement of confidence in the Arcade Fire era. Plus, Spoon aren't dumb: They know albums like <em>Ga Ga</em> only come once or twice a career, even for a band so superhumanly steady. Barreling momentum aside, even the biggest ""Don't You Evah"" fan may be daunted by the prospect of a CD filled with seven iterations of the bulbous tune. So it's a testament not only to Spoon's taste but also their groove-based malleability that this remix project is listenable at all. While ""Don't You Evah"" is an unlikely deluxe EP candidate, its skeletal chug makes it ripe for interpretation-- a fact Spoon know all too well since the song was originally written by the now-defunct NYC band Natural History, whose version caps this disc.</p><p>
    Though the inclusion of ""Don't You Evah""'s source serves as a humble nod, its utter averageness underlines the reasons why Spoon are your favorite indie rockers' favorite indie rockers. While the Spoon version is hardly a total revamp-- the bass riff, vocal melody, and arrangement are nearly identical-- little things like a slight uptick in tempo, a more colloquial title (""Evah"" instead of ""Ever""), some off-the-cuff studio banter, and a few lyrical adjustments make it a vast improvement. Both songs take on notions of commitment and the inevitable cold feet that come along with it. ""Hope you always think it's right/ With that ring is on the finger, feeling tight, tight, tight,"" goes the National History version, which gives advice in the tone of an older, wiser brother. ""Bet you got it all planned, right?/ Never fit to worry,never even feel a fright,"" sings Daniel, taking on a more sarcastic and roguish edge. The differences are slight, but important. The Spoon version is more open-ended-- it's unclear whether the protagonist comes to terms with marriage, busts out of his engagement, or simply goes through the motions miserably. And each of the six ""Don't You Evah"" remixes on this EP run with their own idea of what the track should ultimately feel like and mean.</p><p>
    Ted Leo's excellently dubbed ""I Want It Hotter"" mix takes the song's husband-to-be on a hazy bender somewhere near Lee Perry's underground lair-- it's like an extended outro to the songwriter's recent reggae excursion, ""The Unwanted Things"", off last year's <em>Living With the Living</em>. Leo nails the druggy vibe so much that Daniel's introductory pronunciations of the song's first word (""bet ... bet-uh"") sound like the musings of a smoked-out couch potato to which the word ""bet"" has lost all meaning. The sizzling mix is noticeably more humid than Spoon's take, if not a bit hotter. Electro-rock kingpin Matthew Dear's mix not only fills the apparent universal contract stating either he or Hot Chip must show up on every remix project in existence from now on, he does what Daniel couldn't according to another portion of the song's opening chatter -- he makes it slick. Clearly influenced by fellow remix wiz Four Tet, Dear adds a circular acoustic guitar line and Cloud City keyboards to give the song a contemplative air. Here, it sounds like the track's central character has found happiness along with a couple kids and a manageable mortgage. It's hopeful as it drowns underneath its own sweet synths.  </p><p>
    Elsewhere, party time mixers take things in more traditionally dance-y directions. But-- keeping with Spoon's purposeful tact-- none turn in completely rote, never-ending big bass bullshit. Diplo provides a tasteful, 1980s style rendition that's equal parts wistful and funky. DJ Amaze and Alan Astor show that maybe ""Don't You Evah"" isn't the best template for booty handclaps while MySpace find Doc Delay Fixerupper provides a novelty goofball mix somewhere between ""The Monster Mash"" and Justice. These versions stand in as youthful distractions, but they can't escape Daniel's worry: ""Bet you never think it feels right,"" repeats the singer on six of the EP's eight tracks. And if the record's only new song, the loner piano pusher ""All I Got Is Me"", is any indication, it seems like finer feelings may not come in pairs at all. So while the men in the middle of Spoon's spindly songs may not play well with others, the actual songs themselves are perfectly hospitable to outside interference.</p></div>"|11441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11441-dont-you-evah-ep/|6.7|Ryan Dombal

It's a letter of intent from a band that's squatted on the fence, tentative to commit to one particular genre until now. On their snappy EPs, the fresh-faced Toronto four-piece courted emo, post-punk, and pop fans with equal coquettishness, their brief, catchy songs terminating before anyone could wring them through extensive indie taxonomy. As the band's first release on Saddle Creek, no one should be surprised that <em>Elephant Shell</em> showcases TPC waxing bookish emo. Sure, the songs still barely scrape the two-minute mark, and you'll be hard pressed to find any long-winded solos or codas, but the band's signature assembly line efficiency has become saturated with densely layered arrangements, not to mention lead singer Dave Monks' self-consciously mature vocals. Formally shrouded in megaphone hisses and cracks, Monks practically croons in your ear, and he's brought his thesaurus with him. Already netting considerable Colin Meloy and Ben Gibbard comparisons, Monks' stately delivery isn't exactly shying away from the similarities, especially with mouthfuls like ""Dead lovers salivate/ Broken hearts tessellate tonight.""</p><p>
    Warmed by sentiments like this, the rest of the band sounds equally gooey. Unlike the quick-cut action movie pacing of the EPs, <em>Elephant Shell</em>'s built on fluid songwriting, each track easing into the next without giving the listener much of a jolt. While the holistic craftsmanship is commendable, lush guitar tones and intricate instrumentation doesn't do justice to the band's potential visceral kick. Just listen to the handclaps on ""The Harrowing Adventures Of..."". Recycled from TPC's stunning sci-fi ballad ""Citizens of Tomorrow"", the  claps feel better suited for a golf match, lackadaisically inserted into this ho-hum sea chanty (Meloy strikes again!) as cutesy ornamentation. At times, the newfound prim and properness can feel downright suffocating. The synth line on ""Graves"" desperately wants to blast off like an M83 melody, but the song's brooding heft weighs it down. Even on a solid track like ""Juno"", with its stuttering drum intro and music hall piano punctuations, gets choked off, slumping on its anti-climactic chorus rather than shouting.</p><p>
    Despite these setbacks, <em>Elephant Shell</em> stands to soak up tons of new fans and earn serious shine soundtracking TV teen dramas. That's not so much an attack on the album's marketable gravitas as it is an acknowledgment of its consistently easy-on-the-ears sound. However, with each instrument no longer fighting for attention, and Monks resting comfortably in his mid-range vocal groove, the album leaves a less-than-memorable impression. Whereas cheerleader chants and fanatic barks goaded their earlier ramshackle tracks, urging them along despite the vague sci-fi and political themes, their new incarnation conscientiously covers its bases. After dampening the powerdrill riffs on opener ""Centennial"" with his long-winded lyrics, Monks practically calls timeout towards the track's close to spell things out for us: ""I'm running out of space/ So let me sum this up for you."" The deliberation proves to be an omen. After nailing the rapid-fire EP format with tracks that constantly threatened to disintegrate themselves from the inside-out, TPC psyche themselves out on their first full-length, over-cooking songs made from otherwise spectacular ingredients.</p></div>"|11426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11426-elephant-shell/|6.3|Adam Moerder

But there's more to diskJokke than bulletproof connections; his spacey electro-disco is technically impressive and effortlessly appealing. It's rife with surgically straight percussion, oil-slick synths, bouncy bass, and eerie almost-vocal melodies-- warm sounds with plenty of frigid antimatter, courtesy of judicious effects and pan envelopes, seething between them. Like his countryman Lindstrøm, who came to dance music from a non-dance background, diskJokke studied classical violin and mathematics before turning to beats. The former is evident in his music's sweeping lyricism; the latter, in its cleanly schematized structures.</p><p>
    When we talk about going out, we mean going in-- to a nightclub, restaurant, theater, or other dim enclosure. The background template of diskJokke's MySpace-- a hammock stretched between palm trees before a huge blue sky-- suggests an entirely different listening environment for his music. When he talks about staying in, he means going out, in both senses of the phrase. His tracks are equally suited to the close air of clubs and the breezy expanses of the great outdoors, working in deft juxtapositions of the earthly with the alien. The title track's tropical cheer is tailored for a seaside stroll, with burbling hand percussion and a bright melody that evokes timpani runs. But when these peter out to fully reveal the ice-cold synth dollops coagulating beneath them, it's like an unearthly stillness descending as a UFO suddenly lands in the dunes. The same trick is repeated on the tortuously titled ""I Was Go To Marrocco and I Don't See You"": At first, it's claustrophobic, with a bass line like a big rubber ball bouncing frantically around a small room, but the walls crumble imperceptibly until they suddenly fall away. Then the stars come out, and we drift up through the ceiling.</p><p>
    This sense of vertical motion is crucial to diskJokke's music. Different kinds of techno evoke different kinds of movement: Clark's <em>Turning Dragons</em> is a runaway Tilt-A-Whirl, while Pantha Du Prince's <em>This Bliss</em> hang-glides through the Aurora Borealis. On ""Folk I Farta"", diskJokke is a glass-elevator operator bearing the listener upward through discrete levels of architecture: first floor, Glassian piano runs spinning gyroscopically across stereo channels. Second floor, prizefighting drums. Third floor, synths like Native-American flutes and harmonic washes. Fourth floor, overdriven counter-melody; fifth, drum and bass break. Sixth and final stop-- everything at once, duh. ""Folk I Farta"" is a good example of a track that's set up so well, anything except a predictable finale would be disappointing. Sometimes, diskJokke builds more chutes and ladders into his music: ""Større Enn Først Antatt"" feints where ""Folk I Farta"" steadily ascends. But either way, at the end of each track, the listener seems to have climbed something very high, through thick undergrowth, to emerge in the cold, thin air.</p></div>"|11368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11368-staying-in/|8.0|Brian Howe

He may have abandoned his steadfast SP2100 for the MPC, he may be the featured MC on over half the tracks, and he may be doing his work at every hip-hop head's favorite label for sustainable nostalgia, Nature Sounds, but Pete Rock is still Pete Rock. It should be taken as a compliment to say that <em>NY's Finest</em> feels unhinged in time.</p><p>
    ""914"" dotingly retouches ESG's ""UFO"" (one of the most beloved sample source materials in hip-hop), sanding down the original's howling sirens and tucking its loop under another Rock trademark, a modest, warm horn splice. Ever the consummate crate digger, Rock touches all his favorite sonic bases-- classical, reggae, Miles Davis-- across <em>Finest</em>. And in an age when producers bid for stardom as soon as they hop behind a laptop queued up to Fruity Loops, Pete Rock works selflessly. Steering any MC through the warp and woof of as a beat as calmly as he digs crates, Rock's most seamless gift is the way he can manage a range of talent.</p><p>
    Papoose sounds spring-loaded on album-closing ""Comprehend"". The rhotics and sharp sonorants of New York accents (Masta Killa, Styles P, Raekwon, Jim Jones) bend across Rock's warm overtones. Emotions too sound fresher. Rock has Little Brother pound obese horn section gravitas (another one of those Rock horn loops) on ""Bring Ya'll Back"". Rock himself is a frustratingly spacy vocalist, unsure where the line breaks should go, happier to name check specific drum machines than to pause and inhale. His heart is genuine; his hooks awkward: ""Don't be mad cause you can't do what I can/ Like when Jordan went up for that shot and switched hands.""</p><p>
    On this site Tom Breihan suggested that Snoop Dogg had essentially become rap's Tom Petty. While it doesn't make <em>NY's Finest</em>'s missteps or lyric doddering any cleaner, Pete Rock probably falls into that same matrix. I'll leave the definitive analogy up to someone else (Pete Rock as Brian Eno? Pete Rock as T-Bone Burnett?), but the implications are clear. Everything Pete Rock does now sounds like a sweet negotiation with the past, a vivid reflection of a place and of sound and craft gradually freezing into memory.</p></div>"|11356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11356-nys-finest/|6.8|Evan McGarvey

Or else, trying to prove he can live up to it. At the height of Arctic Monkeys mania in late 2005, the Sheffield, England quartet followed their first UK No. 1-- post-punk dervish ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor""-- with one of Turner's most vivid character sketches to date, red-light vignette ""When the Sun Goes Down"". Which also went to No. 1. More importantly, it hinted that all the hype, most of it from the excitable British press (Terris? Gay Dad? Razorlight?...Coldplay?), wasn't all hype. The next single's B-sides included a cover of 1965 r&amp;b oldie ""Baby, I'm Yours"". When it came time to pick a lead single for fine 2007 sophomore effort <em>Favourite Worst Nightmare</em>, the Arctics went with the one that didn't have a chorus.</p><p>
    In between singing, playing guitar, and writing songs for one of the UK's biggest bands, Turner listened to some records. Old ones: <em>Favourite Worst Nightmare</em> finale ""505"" sampled Ennio Morricone, and in an <strong><a href=""http://www.avclub.com/content/feature/random_rules_alex_turner_of"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a></strong> at the time with <em>The Onion</em>'s A/V Club, Turner touted everything from doo-wop and girl groups to late-1960s David Bowie rarity ""In the Heat of the Morning"". In retrospect, that's where Turner's latest project, the Last Shadow Puppets, begins. The other half of the duo, Miles Kane, played guitar on ""505"". The Bowie song, which the Last Shadow Puppets have since covered as a B-side, could easily have been their aesthetic template.</p><p>
    Kane, formerly of 1960s-tinged English rockers the Little Flames and now with a new group dubbed the Rascals, is actually Turner's least well-known collaborator on the Last Shadow Puppets' full-length debut. Final Fantasy's Owen Pallett, who has arranged strings for the Arcade Fire, does so here with the 22-piece London Metropolitan Orchestra. Simian Mobile Disco half James Ford, who produced <em>Favourite Worst Nightmare</em> and the Klaxons' debut album, produces again and serves double-duty on drums. Together, they've helped create Turner's most impressive album-length statement yet, one that strives, musically and lyrically, for the epic grandeur of an era before GarageBand or MySpace, and avoids lapsing into pretentiousness by dint of its own headlong enthusiasm. As Turner's granddad might say, ""You've overdoon it."" Again.
    </p><p>
    Ford may be better known for his work in unfortunately nicknamed subgenres like blog house and nu-rave, but on <em>The Age of the Understatement</em>, he oversees a remarkably vivid 1960s symphonic-pop pastiche. The title track and first single opens the record at a gallop, stretching the baroque-pop of early Scott Walker-- the Jacques Brel-translating, Ingmar Bergman-feting crooner, not the avant-gardist from <em>Tilt</em> and <em>The Drift</em>-- to the dramatic mariachi brass of Love's <em>Forever Changes</em>, or one of Morricone's Sergio Leone scores. Or Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich's <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LMGl7xJUWw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Legend of Xanadu""</a></strong>. ""About as subtle as an earthquake, I know,"" Turner concedes on ""My Mistakes Were Made for You"", which settles into a regal symphonic-funk groove befitting David Axelrod (the producer for Cannonball Adderley and the Electric Prunes, not the adviser to Barack Obama). Pallett's contributions range from the jittery waltz fanfares of ""Calm Like You"" and whip-cracking horse race of ""Separate and Ever Deadly"" to the downy romance of ""The Meeting Place"", which could've fit on an album by the Arctics' fellow Sheffield son Richard Hawley.
    </p>
<p>
    So obviously the biggest difference between the Last Shadow Puppets and Turner's main gig is in the lyrics. Though less immediately noticeable than the majestic production, the change in the scale of Turner's songwriting is ultimately more profound. The video for ""The Age of the Understatement"" is set in Russia, and compared to the Arctics' insider-ish dispatches about Life Among the Chavs or Life As the Biggest New Band Since Oasis, these songs are Tolstoy in their bird's-eye omniscience. ""Burglary and fireworks, the skies they were alight,"" Turner sings on ""Calm Like You"", describing a once-exciting city and the bitter romance that took place there. Brisk, timpani-rumbling ""Standing Next to Me"" is just conventional love-triangle stuff, but it finds Turner moving from his anthropologically detailed Arctics brushstrokes to bold, cinematic gestures: ""You want to have her/ Two years have gone now/ But I can't relate."" And on stinging recrimination ""Black Plant"": ""He's got papercuts from the love letters you never gave him.""
    </p>
<p>
    Turner wisely decides not to compete in the crooner sweepstakes, letting his voice retain its usual charming grittiness. Kane, from near Liverpool, sings in a voice that blends in as naturally as if they were brothers. So if you hear only the caustic vocals and lavish arrangements of faster-paced tracks like ""Only the Truth"", the Last Shadow Puppets are exactly what you'd expect Arctics-with-strings to sound like. This single-mindedness hampers songs like ""The Chamber"" or ""I Don't Like You Any More"", which work fine on their own but offer little to distinguish themselves when following <em>The Age of the Understatement</em>'s stirring first half. As on both Arctics albums, though, Turner keeps a tender surprise up his sleeve. The first minute of finale ""The Time Has Come Again"" strips away all but neatly picked acoustic guitar and a 22-year-old's panging nostalgia for a few years earlier. ""Don't go too soon/ She went too soon,"" Turner and Kane harmonize, as strings rise up to meet them, whatever people say they are, and everything else.

Every time they get a gig, Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie take the stage and limp their way through the deadly ""Who Likes to Rock the Party"". But in their own heads, they're stars: deadly rappers, psychedelic princes, and unstoppable ladykillers. It's a good joke, and the Conchords spun it into a hilarious HBO series-- the best quasi-mockumentary since <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em>, and a sendup of the myth of the struggling band that came right when the whole music biz feels blue.</p><p>
    But the concept gets muddled, especially on their first full-length studio record. Where do they draw the lines between the real-life band, the band we see struggling on the show, and the band that the struggling band wishes it could be? They bill themselves as New Zealand's fourth-best novelty act-- so should we laugh at the songs, or with them? And their love of AM radio love songs shines true-- they thank Barry White in the album liner notes, probably not ironically-- but are we supposed to congratulate them for trying to do the same thing?</p><p>
    In other words: Sure they're funny, but are these songs supposed to be any <em>good</em>? Surprisingly, yes. In their live act-- which is rigorously documented on YouTube-- Bret and Jemaine play a folk/comedy duo, mostly with acoustic guitar. But for their first studio album, working with producer Mickey Petralia, they graduate to a soft-rock exotica crossed with pool-side world beat and cockblocked lounge. The Conchords have an ear for melody and they take their genre appropriations seriously enough, especially on the French (phrasebook) lyrics and musky harmonies of ""Foux du Fafa"". But even with synths, percussion, and the occasional horn player, the arrangements enhance the core duo instead of supplanting them: hip-hop satire ""Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenoceros [ft. Rhymenoceros and the Hiphopopotamus]"" adds beats, but most of the rhythm comes from the guitars.
    </p><p>
    This approach also keeps the album low-key, almost too much so. ""Boom"" had more oomph in the television version-- and all the dancing low-wage sign-holders in the video didn't hurt-- and when they got to the old chestunt ""Robots"", they sound like they've sung these jokes a couple times too many. (Stick with the live version, on last fall's EP.) They hit the highest energy level on the closers, ""Business Time"" and ""Bowie"", and while the guys are commended for not trying to ham it up, it's a strikingly mellow album for a comedy record. Assuming, that is, that it's mainly a comedy album and not just an indie rock record that's funny. 
    </p>
<p>
    And oh yeah, it is really funny. Even the jokes that try a little too hard-- like half of ""Inner City Pressure""-- wear well after several listens. ""Most Beautiful Girl (in the Room)"" and ""Business Time"" are still the highpoints, both true to life and totally hilarious: ""You're so beautiful, you could be an air hostess in the 60s...you could be a part-time model/ But you'd probably have to keep your day job."" And series fave ""Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenoceros"" matches the stumbling charm of the TV version even without the breakdancing. 
    </p>
<p>
    Some nitpicks: They probably left off one of your favorite songs-- say, ""Bret You've Got It Going on"", or ""Mermaids,"" or for that matter, ""Who Likes to Rock the Party"". And they included a couple, like ""Leggy Blonde"", that flounder without a story to set them up. But it's fair to guess that most of the listeners already know all the episodes by heart. The hardest-working duo in novelty finally made it to the studio, but they're still saving their old routines for posterity. And they're still working towards the pop craftsmanship-- and raw, irresistable sex power-- that they dreamt about on the show. We'll see what happens next year, when the series comes back; after all, they have a whole season's worth of new material to write, and the sky is still the limit.

It arguably peaked somewhere around 1985-1986: BDP's dancehall-inflected crime-story classic ""9mm Goes Bang"" out of the South Bronx, Schoolly D's killer two-fer ""P.S.K.-- What Does It Mean?"" / ""Gucci Time"" 12"" out of Philly, and Ice-T's prototypical West Coast gangsta anthem ""6 'N the Mornin'"" were all built on a sound that traded the old school's post-disco funk loop structure for something both rougher-edged and more futuristic.</p>
<p>Chief amongst the catalysts for this sound was Kurtis Mantronik, a Jamaican-Syrian-American record store DJ who produced his debut single before he turned 20. His first major release, ""Needle to the Groove"", personifies our current idea of how drum machine hip-hop sounds-- even if, upon its 1985 release, it sounded pretty damn out there compared to its peers. <i>Mantronix: The Album</i> has undergone a strangely accidental evolution to its status as a lost hip-hop classic: Beloved by veteran heads yet considered incredibly dated in the sample-artisan Dre/RZA/Pete Rock/Primo 90s, it's since started sounding a lot more like a well-aging and prescient forebear of Southern bounce and hyphy.</p>
<p>While the Deluxe Edition of <i>The Album </i>is an exhaustive 2xCD collection of remixes, extended versions, instrumentals, and a cappellas, the seven songs at the original album's core-- six originals and a slightly redundant but enjoyable ""Mega-Mix""-- are the main draw. More specifically, it's Mantronik's production, which incorporates multiple layers of polyrhythmic boom-clap percussion, alien-sounding proto-acid bass, and dubbed-out scratching that sounds like King Tubby trying his hand at turntablism. Tracks like ""Hardcore Hip-Hop"" and ""Needle to the Groove"" boast some of the most intricately assembled syncopated beats heard in any digital production to that point, and the mutated go-go of ""Ladies"" has a lot of carefully threaded gears turning beneath its instant-hook bounce, claps and kicks throwing counter-measures against each other until they sound like a rhythmic swordfight. But it's ""Bassline"" that's probably the most famously innovative of these tracks: The titular low end turns electro's android jerkiness into a live-body strut, and the immaculate drum programming contains a busy but carefully refined volley of claps and snare hits that dart and weave in and out of each other spectacularly. It's this complexity and attention to detail that makes the production about as carefully human-crafted as any electronic music of the 80s, even as it focuses all that effort and energy squarely at the art of moving butts.</p>
<p>As prescient as some of this stuff sounds, the vocal portion of this duo is more of his time-- MC Tee is as 1985 as they come, replete with sing-song post-LL flow, party-people-centric lyrics, and an instance of the word  ""shit""  getting bleeped out. Those who don't mind how lyricism sounded before Rakim will find charm in Tee's voice, though-- for one thing, he acts as yet another fine-tuned component of Mantronik's rhythmic traffic, frequently adding an altered cadence and off-beat emphases in what would otherwise be a straightforward old-school flow. (Plus it always helps to have a vocoder or a scratch answer back a few times.) Producer and MC complement each other enough that the instrumental tracks included on the extra disc seem incomplete, though as bonuses go having them is nice; throwing in a truckload of 12"", radio, and alternate edits (including the even-thicker club version of ""Bassline"") and a couple of solid live performances of ""Needle to the Groove"" and ""Ladies"" is even better.</p>
<p>Mantronik would have a couple more years of hip-hop greatness ahead of him: a few T La Rock singles made in the wake of his smash ""It's Yours"", including ""Back to Burn"" and ""This Beat Kicks"", became underrated classics, and Just-Ice's misleadingly named 1986 LP <i>Back to the Old School</i> boasted one of the all-time great mid-80s hardcore breaks-- the monstrous ""Cold Gettin' Dumb"". On top of that, the second Mantronix LP, <i>Music Madness</i>, was a solid expansion of his signature sound. But by the late 80s he was arguably more revered by hardcore heads as an A&amp;R than a producer, and his signing of EPMD to Sleeping Bag records ironically helped fuel a shift from mid-school electro-rap to the funk-break revivalism of rap's Golden Age. His house-friendly 1998 remix of EPMD's classic ""Strictly Business"" is indication enough of where he went from there, further away from traditional hip-hop and deeper into dance club territory, but don't take that as a warning.  <i>Mantronix: The Album </i>sounds, in retrospect, more like the peak of classic rap innovation than a crossover compromise, and damn if it doesn't sound great played between Turf Talk and Mannie Fresh.</p></div>"|11385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11385-mantronix-the-album-deluxe-edition/|8.1|Nate Patrin

Young Marble Giants' really should. Statton sang, with gentle understatement, in that beloved, <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/44728-colossal-youth-and-collected-works"">recently reissued</a></strong> Welsh post-punk group, but she doesn't bear any obvious relation to the album titled after her. Just this: Pants Yell! deal in gentle understatement, too. And on their fourth album, the Boston indie pop trio do so in a way that might even convince you to give that silly exclamation point one more stupid chance.<br/></p><p>
    Young Marble Giants' empty space came as a rebuke to every band that ever turned it up to 11, but <em>Alison Stratton</em>'s rebellion is subtler than quiet vs. loud. For one thing, although undeniably twee (they've covered Jens Lekman), Pants Yell! aren't afraid of a big sound. New drummer Casey Keenan, who joins founding members Andrew Churchman and Sterling Bryant via Boston psych-rock group Major Stars, powers up the rhythm section considerably, his energetic fills driving the songs forward. Nor is <em>Alison Stratton</em> shy about feedback, letting the scraggly noise that Pavement learned from the Clean tatter the edges of their fey boy-girl harmonies on ""A New City Life"", or grind the glockenspiel-chiming ""The Royal We"" to a screechy halt. One-minute, 17-second ""Shoreham Kent"" even nicks the tom-bashing instrumental hook from the Cure's ""Boys Don't Cry"".</p><p>
    Pants Yell!'s revolt isn't in declining to overpower with volume. It's in rejecting the grandiose. Churchman, who sings in the shy tenor of an American Stuart Murdoch, writes sweetly melancholy songs, as unprepossessing as growing up in the suburbs. Relationships die slowly, youth gets a bittersweet smell-ya-later. At its catchiest, <em>Alison Statton</em> comes close to the wry, wistful jangle of the Lucksmiths. See outsider's anthem ""Reject, Reject"", or the horn-backed ""Magenta and Green"" and ""Trying to Be Good""-- that last title really belongs on an indie-pop book (Would-Be-Goods would get their own chapter). ""For Dee"" is slow, stripped-down, and heartbreaking: ""I'll take all my goodbyes back/ If you give all your I-love-yous/ Waste 'em on anyone you choose.""
    </p><p>
    ""I'd rather be a singer than a one-man band,"" Churchman sings on the title track. He isn't alone: For all the talk about the halcyon days of Postcard, Rough Trade, and Sarah Records in the UK, or K Records and Slumberland in the U.S., there's still a thriving indie pop underground today (and not just in Sweden), with its own gatherings, message boards, blogs. Some of the bands can be too gentle, understated, or, given the participatory culture, sometimes amateurish for their own good. Pants Yell! are a part of that community, and <em>Alison Statton</em> shows them maturing into one of its better ambassadors. Not the kind of ambassador that's all grandiose-like though.

Factory']|2008-04-22 00:00:00|2008|2016-06-11 19:26:26.354664|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1ij0gx721og.1.6:0.1.0.$11306/=1$11306.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>
    The comedian Ricky Gervais likes nothing better than slaughtering sacred cows, and on last year's ""BBC Comic Relief"" telethon, it was rock star do-gooders on charitable holiday in Africa he tagged the ill-fated heifer. In a brilliant bit, he fakes a self-righteous visit to Kenya, meeting with a poor villager who calls a cassette of U2's <em>The Joshua Tree</em> ""one of his most prized possessions."" ""When my brother was in the hospital,"" relates the fake villager, ""the doctor played him this cassette."" Gervais sheds a (fake) tear.</p><p>
    ""Africa Celebrates U2"", proclaims the subhead of <em>In the Name of Love</em>, a collection of diverse African acts covering the Irish rock band, but that seems generally unlikely outside of this comp. Indeed, the notion of African acts paying tribute to U2 initially is a bit hard to swallow as much more than a gimmick, as if the rock band has made such pervasive inroads across the continent to ever be cited as a real influence. That the tribute to the music of such notorious do-gooders is itself a benefit, with proceeds going to the Global Fund (to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria) provides an awkward element of irony, however well intentioned.</p><p>
    Yet against all odds, <em>In the Name of Love</em> is no hackwork, and the hodgepodge of acts gathered together do represent some of Africa's highest profile musicians, at least in terms of crossover power. Even more laudable, the disc makes a point of delineating just where each performer is from, avoiding the patronizing habit of those who thoughtlessly rope together almost one billion people like they're all from one country. There's Vieux Farka Touré (from Mali), Tony Allen (from Nigeria), Les Nubians (from Cameroon), Cheikh Lô (from Senegal), the Soweto Gospel Choir (from South Africa), Sierra Leone's Refugee All-Stars (from Sierra Leone, natch), and several more (though, oddly enough, no one representing North Africa, or even specifically Morocco, site of some sessions for U2's upcoming 12th album).
    </p>
<p>
    All the songs, save Vusi Mahlasela's ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"", come from U2's prolonged pre-<em>Pop</em> golden period, and over half from the twin classics <em>The Joshua Tree</em> and <em>Achtung Baby</em>, which makes sense, given the respective (global?) ubiquity of each album. In fact, most of the tracks here fall on the familiar side of the U2 catalog, leaving it up to each act to suss out a new take on old stand-bys.
    </p>
<p>
    They do a pretty good job, too, and while nothing here is totally unrecognizable, a few tracks are reasonably inspired. Tony Allen transforms ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" into sunny, funky, horn-propelled Afrobeat lite. Vieux Farka Touré injects more desert blues into ""Bullet the Blue Sky"" than U2 ever managed. The Soweto Gospel Choir accomplish something similar with ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"". After all, no self-respecting gospel choir would ever tap Bono as a member, no matter how hard he tries, so it's neat to hear pros achieve what the singer can only simulate.
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, Angelique Kidjo re-imagines ""Mysterious Ways"" as an Afro-Caribbean hybrid, and Les Nubians twist ""With or Without You"" into a stylish and modern Afropop ballad. The kora and wah-wah guitar mix in Ba Cissoko's ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and Cheikh Lô's talking-drum and fretless bass adorned ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" are pretty convincing. The African Underground All-Stars' hip-hop version of ""Desire"" isn't, but their collective heart is clearly in the right place.
    </p>
<p>
    Not every track is a cover of a chart smash. The Sierra Leone All-Stars successfully tackle the martial ""Seconds"", from <em>War</em>, taking advantage of the original's reggae-ish bass run but pairing it with a jittery, percussion-heavy dance groove rather than militant rhythms. And concluding the disc is Waldemar Bastos' haunting version of the bleak <em>Achtung Baby</em> finale ""Love is Blindness"", with the original's power-drill guitar solo replaced with some strained, pained vocals. 
    </p>
<p>
    That the interpretations here are more interesting than essential, revealing few new facets of artist and song alike, is to be expected, especially when dealing with such (like it or not) iconic source material. But the fact that <em>In the Name of Love</em> handles such a potentially pitfall-rich project without any major stumbles-- and no groan-inducing ""play the rumba, Edge!"" moments-- is perhaps good enough.<br/>

Try living within the detritus of our aging teenage mass culture. In the 1950s, the Teenagers were a doo-wop group who backed up Frankie Lymon on ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love""; the Teenagers of today are a London- and Paris-based foursome whose songs work on the innocently sleazy assumption that ""Beverly Hills 90210"", <i>American Pie</i>, and Nada Surf's ""Popular"" showed U.S. high schoolers as they really are. Their 2007 single ""Homecoming"" ingeniously encapsulates this approach, pairing Jonathan Richman's wide eyes with the busily groping hands of Serge Gainsbourg. After a handful of other singles and remixes (including an excellent one of Simian Mobile Disco's ""It's the Beat""), full-length debut <i>Reality Check</i> still can't match the Teenagers' first time, but it shows a developing group with their own distinct take on misspent youth in the era of free internet porn.</p>
<p>As with Art Brut or the Streets, their sound-- equal parts raw and mechanical, and a little lacking in variation-- isn't so much the point but it definitely fits their outlook. Smirking, French-accented lo-fi vocals earnestly sneer; tinny electronic beats, New Order guitars, and gleaming synths form a backing that's halfway between dance-punk and mall-punk. ""I fucked her-- it was wild/ She's such a slut,"" frontman Quentin Delafon bluntly asserts on ""Homecoming"", before his American cheerleader tells the girls, ""It was perfect, a dream come true/ Just like a song by Blink-182."" So, it's a 1990s revival in a time of 1980s revival (and free internet porn).</p>
<p>When it's good, <i>Reality Check</i> can be Anthony-Michael-Hall-gets-Jennifer-Love-Hewitt good. ""Love No"", also given an optimistic electro-house remix by Spain's Delorean, is another ""Homecoming""-style two-part conversation, with Delafon this time standing in for both boy and girl (""That movie <i>Showgirls</i>? I can't believe you're watching it <i>again</i>"") as a battle of the sexes ends in cynical ceasefire. ""But It's OK to stay with you/ I'm not in love, oh, oh,"" he sings. On ""Feeling Better"", which could be the Teenagers' theme song if there weren't already one called ""We Are the Teenagers"" on their <i>Fuck Nicole</i> EP, they humbly request your obsession, quote ""Heal the World"", and sell you their T-shirt. ""Starlett Johansson"" lists the birthdate, place, and life story of a certain Tom Waits-covering starlet. The Teenagers can be sensitive, too, like when asking what-ifs on the slow, gliding ""Wheel of Fortune"" about a world without Ben Affleck, or whether you would still do them if they had unibrows.</p>
<p>It's not always this good, and not just because that can all get to be slightly too much to take in larger than EP-sized doses. ""III"" amps up only to shout its ignorance a few times too shrilly. ""French Kiss""-- hey, wait, I get it! ...French class! Sure, early song ""Fuck Nicole"" does have me cursing at total strangers, but I prefer ""Homecoming"" because it <i>doesn't</i> have this shade of menace. ""Sunset Beach"" brutally murders Jeff Buckley; ""End of the Road"" is slow, but not a slow jam. ""Make It Happen"" isn't about <i>it</i>, but it does yield this significant couplet: ""And if we tell lies, we'll look at you straight in the eyes."" Did you hear? He fucked her.</p></div>"|11400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11400-reality-check/|6.9|Marc Hogan

But the group's persona has a distancing effect for those who are new to the band. There's never been a shortage of thirty and fortysomethings reminiscing about the 'Mats. You read about the sloppily brilliant live performances, the massive quantities of beer consumed, the backstage hijinks; questionable theories are proffered, something about how this band should, if there were any justice in the world, have had pop hits and been on the radio. You hear such things from the people who were there, man, and it's tempting to dismiss the Replacements as a Gen X nostalgia trip and turn your attention to some unexplored corner of post-punk, maybe a boundary-pushing band with an experimental bent. The <i>idea </i>of the Replacements has a lot to do with why they've endured, and as archetypes go, it's a compelling one. But sometimes it gets in the way.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if these reissues from Rhino, which remaster and generously expand upon the band's four early records for their hometown imprint Twin/Tone, can bring us back to what the Replacements were: a creative, smart, silly, exuberant, and often hilarious rock'n'roll band. Rhino has done everything right with these records, giving them the sort of treatment they deserve. The liner notes and documentation are detailed; the bonus cuts generous and well chosen. This crucial part of the Replacements story is finally available in all its detail, and hopefully, it'll help us hear the music again in a fresh way. There's a lot worth exploring.</p>
<p>Hearing these records again, after having the originals in mothballs for quite a while, has been a revelation. It's not that they're top-to-bottom great (well, except for one of them, but more on that in a sec), because the Replacements weren't really that kind of act. But boy, they had songs and they could play, right from the start. Before these reissues, when someone would say that the band peaked with their first album, 1981's <b><i>Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash</i></b>, I'd assume they were either: 1) a serial contrarian, 2) someone who finds punk rock to be music's greatest expression, or 3) crazy. Surely, the Replacements improved as they went. But now, returning to these records after so long, the ""debut is best"" take finally makes some sense. I don't <i>agree </i>with this assessment, not by a long shot, but I can understand why someone might. For a supposedly sloppy and tossed-off record, <i>Sorry Ma</i> comes across as weirdly majestic and strikingly consistent. Also, amusing: singer Paul Westerberg's self-deprecating liner notes, which helped launch the Replacements myth, suggest that he might have had second career writing comedy: ""This song is proof that Chris Mars is one of the best drummers we could find at the time,"" he says of ""Otto"".</p>
<p>As the short, sharp tracks tick off, each is immediately arresting. If Mothers Against Drunk Driving hadn't formed the year before, the invigorating and dangerous jolt of ""Takin a Ride"" might have served as the organization's catalyst; ""Customer"" is comical fast-talking portrait of an instant crush; ""Shiftless When Idle"" is an early statement of purpose. Bob Stinson can't wait to bust out his searing solos. Everything sounds loose, live, and brimming with energy. Over 18 songs, only a couple are less than great. Among the 13 bonus tracks, the highlight is the four-song demo from 1980 the band originally gave to Twin/Tone's Peter Jesperson, hoping to get some club gigs. I'm trying to imagine the excitement when he popped it in his tape deck and heard ""Raised in the City"", with its relentless drive and chugga-chugga riff and a 20-year-old Westerberg sounding like he already knew a hell of a lot about it melody. No wonder Jesperson became their manager.</p>
<p>Then came <b><i>Stink</i></b>, the quickie EP follow-up from 1982. The cover's subtitle used to say ""'Kids Don't Follow' Plus Seven"" and its expanded version now reads ""'Kids Don't Follow' Plus 11"". Well, it's true: ""Kids Don't Follow"" is much better than these other songs. This is their true-blue punk record, and, while they pull it off, they sound too one-dimensional. The songs are entertaining, with titles alone that are good for a chuckle: ""Fuck School""; ""White and Lazy""; ""Dope Smokin' Moron""; ""God Damn Job"". You can guess how they go without even hearing them; it's a record for a single mood. Some the outtakes are actually better: There's a great cover of Hank Williams' ""Hey, Good Lookin"" that was a live staple of the time, and their disemboweling of ""(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock"" is worth a few laughs. <i>Stink </i>is an important piece of the puzzle, but less interesting on its own.</p>
<p><b><i>Hootenanny </i></b>is occasionally mentioned as the Replacements finest moment, the precursor to <i>Let It Be</i> that is funnier, more tossed-off, (i.e., more ""Replacements"") and also the most diverse offering in the band's catalogue. No argument on the latter; this thing is all over the place, and it has one example of just about everything they ever did. But too much of it sounds purposeless, the band amusing themselves rather than the listener. Some tracks have the whiff of something that would have been OK as B-sides, but sound underwhelming on an album proper. The title track isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is; ""Mr. Whirly"", which mixes snippets of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Oh! Darlin'"", and ""The Twist"", is clever but skippable; ""Lovelines"", in which Westerburg half-sings personals ads while the band plays a peppy tune behind him, is infectious in the way that hearing someone else laugh makes you laugh, but it's also easy to forget. All that said: ""Color Me Impressed"" is possibly the best of the 10 or so proper Replacements Anthems, the moody ""Willpower"" improves on <i>Stink</i>'s ""Go"", and ""Run It"" is as intense and joyous as any of the rave-ups on the debut. Bonus tracks here are also strong, mostly loud, fast, and snotty, with the exception of the bluesy acoustic demo ""Bad Worker"", about giving minimum effort for minimum wage. Essential for fans, but not the place to start.</p>
<p><i>Hootenanny</i>'s ""Within Your Reach"" found Westerberg stretching out and trying a love song of sorts, but it would take one more record before he really hit his stride with this sort of material. The leap in songwriting on <i>Let It Be</i>, the final Twin/Tone album, is dazzling. As a record, it's both simpler and more complicated than anything that came before. You want hardcore? ""We're Comin' Out"" is the most intense punk song they ever made. A no-frills declaration of love? You can't get much more concise than ""Favorite Thing"". There's the perceptive ""I Will Dare"", which seems like it's about a relationship but is also about the band ready to take on the world; the wailing ""Unsatisfied"", with its disarmingly direct expression of frustration. All of the contradictions and wild mood swings of youth can be found here somewhere.</p>
<p><b><i> Let It Be</i></b> is widely praised as an independent rock classic and one of the finest albums of the 1980s, but before I started listening to this set, I didn't expect to rate it so highly. I kept thinking of songs that even fans of the record consider insignificant, namely ""Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out"", the cover of Kiss' ""Black Diamond"", the near-instrumental ""Seen Your Video"" and the silly ""Gary's Got a Boner"". Surely, this was filler.</p>
<p>But the more I listened, the more I realized that all these songs have their place, and each does work on the album that needs doing. Film critics like to speak of emotionally charged moments being ""earned"" by carefully laid groundwork in character development. The farther Westerberg went out on a limb with songs like ""Androgynous"" (all of a sudden he's the indie rock Cole Porter, looking out for the shy, arty types that didn't fit in) and ""Sixteen Blue"" (the ultimate articulation of teenage angst), the more empathy he showed and the more he needed ballast. The dumb songs offer relief and make the ballads hit that much harder. They also rip. It helps that this is the best-sounding record they ever made, and the rockers pummel like never before. The mix is clear; the guitars tear the space in half when they need to and ring clearly when they don't, when they throw in unusual instruments, they work. The six outtakes-- a couple of covers (of T. Rex and, uh, the DeFranco Family featuring Tony DeFranco), and two choice originals-- are strong, but they wouldn't have fit on a record that doesn't waste a note. <i>Let It Be</i> is, in its own way, perfect.</p>
<p>Being a fuck-up with a good heart is endearing when you're young; if you've not changed by the time you hit your late twenties, well, you're probably just pretty much a fuck-up, and eventually, you become annoying. All the contradictions in the Replacements' music, and in Westerberg's songwriting, are not something you can easily carry into adulthood, which is partly why the band would run into some trouble later on. But none of that matters here, when they were young and understood so much about youth. People change, but records don't, and that's part of what makes them great. They're frozen in place, ready to be found by people who need them. And if you haven't found these yet-- well, I'm jealous.</p></div>"|11676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11676-sorry-ma-forgot-to-take-out-the-trash-stink-hootenanny-let-it-be/|9.4|Mark Richardson

But the group's persona has a distancing effect for those who are new to the band. There's never been a shortage of thirty and fortysomethings reminiscing about the 'Mats. You read about the sloppily brilliant live performances, the massive quantities of beer consumed, the backstage hijinks; questionable theories are proffered, something about how this band should, if there were any justice in the world, have had pop hits and been on the radio. You hear such things from the people who were there, man, and it's tempting to dismiss the Replacements as a Gen X nostalgia trip and turn your attention to some unexplored corner of post-punk, maybe a boundary-pushing band with an experimental bent. The <i>idea </i>of the Replacements has a lot to do with why they've endured, and as archetypes go, it's a compelling one. But sometimes it gets in the way.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if these reissues from Rhino, which remaster and generously expand upon the band's four early records for their hometown imprint Twin/Tone, can bring us back to what the Replacements were: a creative, smart, silly, exuberant, and often hilarious rock'n'roll band. Rhino has done everything right with these records, giving them the sort of treatment they deserve. The liner notes and documentation are detailed; the bonus cuts generous and well chosen. This crucial part of the Replacements story is finally available in all its detail, and hopefully, it'll help us hear the music again in a fresh way. There's a lot worth exploring.</p>
<p>Hearing these records again, after having the originals in mothballs for quite a while, has been a revelation. It's not that they're top-to-bottom great (well, except for one of them, but more on that in a sec), because the Replacements weren't really that kind of act. But boy, they had songs and they could play, right from the start. Before these reissues, when someone would say that the band peaked with their first album, 1981's <b><i>Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash</i></b>, I'd assume they were either: 1) a serial contrarian, 2) someone who finds punk rock to be music's greatest expression, or 3) crazy. Surely, the Replacements improved as they went. But now, returning to these records after so long, the ""debut is best"" take finally makes some sense. I don't <i>agree </i>with this assessment, not by a long shot, but I can understand why someone might. For a supposedly sloppy and tossed-off record, <i>Sorry Ma</i> comes across as weirdly majestic and strikingly consistent. Also, amusing: singer Paul Westerberg's self-deprecating liner notes, which helped launch the Replacements myth, suggest that he might have had second career writing comedy: ""This song is proof that Chris Mars is one of the best drummers we could find at the time,"" he says of ""Otto"".</p>
<p>As the short, sharp tracks tick off, each is immediately arresting. If Mothers Against Drunk Driving hadn't formed the year before, the invigorating and dangerous jolt of ""Takin a Ride"" might have served as the organization's catalyst; ""Customer"" is comical fast-talking portrait of an instant crush; ""Shiftless When Idle"" is an early statement of purpose. Bob Stinson can't wait to bust out his searing solos. Everything sounds loose, live, and brimming with energy. Over 18 songs, only a couple are less than great. Among the 13 bonus tracks, the highlight is the four-song demo from 1980 the band originally gave to Twin/Tone's Peter Jesperson, hoping to get some club gigs. I'm trying to imagine the excitement when he popped it in his tape deck and heard ""Raised in the City"", with its relentless drive and chugga-chugga riff and a 20-year-old Westerberg sounding like he already knew a hell of a lot about it melody. No wonder Jesperson became their manager.</p>
<p>Then came <b><i>Stink</i></b>, the quickie EP follow-up from 1982. The cover's subtitle used to say ""'Kids Don't Follow' Plus Seven"" and its expanded version now reads ""'Kids Don't Follow' Plus 11"". Well, it's true: ""Kids Don't Follow"" is much better than these other songs. This is their true-blue punk record, and, while they pull it off, they sound too one-dimensional. The songs are entertaining, with titles alone that are good for a chuckle: ""Fuck School""; ""White and Lazy""; ""Dope Smokin' Moron""; ""God Damn Job"". You can guess how they go without even hearing them; it's a record for a single mood. Some the outtakes are actually better: There's a great cover of Hank Williams' ""Hey, Good Lookin"" that was a live staple of the time, and their disemboweling of ""(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock"" is worth a few laughs. <i>Stink </i>is an important piece of the puzzle, but less interesting on its own.</p>
<p><b><i>Hootenanny </i></b>is occasionally mentioned as the Replacements finest moment, the precursor to <i>Let It Be</i> that is funnier, more tossed-off, (i.e., more ""Replacements"") and also the most diverse offering in the band's catalogue. No argument on the latter; this thing is all over the place, and it has one example of just about everything they ever did. But too much of it sounds purposeless, the band amusing themselves rather than the listener. Some tracks have the whiff of something that would have been OK as B-sides, but sound underwhelming on an album proper. The title track isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is; ""Mr. Whirly"", which mixes snippets of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Oh! Darlin'"", and ""The Twist"", is clever but skippable; ""Lovelines"", in which Westerburg half-sings personals ads while the band plays a peppy tune behind him, is infectious in the way that hearing someone else laugh makes you laugh, but it's also easy to forget. All that said: ""Color Me Impressed"" is possibly the best of the 10 or so proper Replacements Anthems, the moody ""Willpower"" improves on <i>Stink</i>'s ""Go"", and ""Run It"" is as intense and joyous as any of the rave-ups on the debut. Bonus tracks here are also strong, mostly loud, fast, and snotty, with the exception of the bluesy acoustic demo ""Bad Worker"", about giving minimum effort for minimum wage. Essential for fans, but not the place to start.</p>
<p><i>Hootenanny</i>'s ""Within Your Reach"" found Westerberg stretching out and trying a love song of sorts, but it would take one more record before he really hit his stride with this sort of material. The leap in songwriting on <i>Let It Be</i>, the final Twin/Tone album, is dazzling. As a record, it's both simpler and more complicated than anything that came before. You want hardcore? ""We're Comin' Out"" is the most intense punk song they ever made. A no-frills declaration of love? You can't get much more concise than ""Favorite Thing"". There's the perceptive ""I Will Dare"", which seems like it's about a relationship but is also about the band ready to take on the world; the wailing ""Unsatisfied"", with its disarmingly direct expression of frustration. All of the contradictions and wild mood swings of youth can be found here somewhere.</p>
<p><b><i> Let It Be</i></b> is widely praised as an independent rock classic and one of the finest albums of the 1980s, but before I started listening to this set, I didn't expect to rate it so highly. I kept thinking of songs that even fans of the record consider insignificant, namely ""Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out"", the cover of Kiss' ""Black Diamond"", the near-instrumental ""Seen Your Video"" and the silly ""Gary's Got a Boner"". Surely, this was filler.</p>

Rex and, uh, the DeFranco Family featuring Tony DeFranco), and two choice originals-- are strong, but they wouldn't have fit on a record that doesn't waste a note. <i>Let It Be</i> is, in its own way, perfect.</p>
<p>Being a fuck-up with a good heart is endearing when you're young; if you've not changed by the time you hit your late twenties, well, you're probably just pretty much a fuck-up, and eventually, you become annoying. All the contradictions in the Replacements' music, and in Westerberg's songwriting, are not something you can easily carry into adulthood, which is partly why the band would run into some trouble later on. But none of that matters here, when they were young and understood so much about youth. People change, but records don't, and that's part of what makes them great. They're frozen in place, ready to be found by people who need them. And if you haven't found these yet-- well, I'm jealous.</p></div>"|11676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11676-sorry-ma-forgot-to-take-out-the-trash-stink-hootenanny-let-it-be/|10.0|Mark Richardson

This is the question Numero Group's Rob Sevier and Ken Shipley ask in their liner notes for <em>Don't Stop: Recording Tap</em>. The question is rhetorical, of course, a way of explaining how difficult it was to assemble this compilation of a New York record label that was so obscure that it barely even released records and most of the people involved who can be located don't even want to talk about it. The label's very founder, Jeremiah Yisrael, born Teddy T. Thompson and now living in Jacksonville, Fla., refused for years to give up his old, moldering tapes and carefully selects the memories he shares of the time.</p><p>
    The Numero guys have been through this kind of thing before as they've researched the eight volumes of their Eccentric Soul series, and though technically not part of that series, this could easily have been the ninth volume, between the backstory and the music it contains. The music on the collection was recorded in the early 1980s, as disco faded and rap was on the rise in the nation's biggest city. Continuity wasn't a big thing for Yisrael, and he moved his label from project to project, abandoning previous ones along the way, sometimes without even bothering to release them. Possible deals with the likes of Sugar Hill's Sylvia Robinson fell by the wayside as he set his sites on the next thing, and great early rap tracks that could have blown up if released when they were recorded in 1981 instead fell with a barely audible thump in 1986, years past their shelf date.</p><p>
    Yisrael wasn't running a shoestring operation. He ran the Bronx-based T&amp;T health food chain and was the organizer of the Brotherhood of Wisdom, Temple of Issachar, a storefront church that focused on the Torah. In the past, he'd apprenticed with Motown/Mercury/ OldWorld/Chess/Atco/ producer Gene Redd, Jr., who ultimately came to work for Tap, and he'd also had a brief acting career, including a role in the 1972 Bond flick Live and Let Die. He poured money into his recording sessions, booking time at Mayfair, Power Station, and Right Track, bringing in string orchestras and professional arrangers, some of whose hand-notated work can be seen in the supplemental book that comes with the CD.
    </p><p>
    Disco is the bedrock of all of these recordings, and though some manage to be lo-fi in spite of their budgets, they all possess an infectious quality and a stomping, high-tempo groove. Yisrael started with Annette Denvil, who he discovered at a talent show he organized. ""So Nice"", the song included here, features smoothly grooving verses balanced by a somewhat sinister minor-key riff in between. It's good, but it's an hors d'oeuvre relative to what would come after, after Denvil's would-be music career ended with a positive pregnancy test.
    </p>
<p>
    The year 1981 held great potential for Tap, as Yisrael latched on to the rap sound that was blowing up in the Bronx and Harlem. He brought in a crew, the Fabulous 3 MCs, and immediately set about finding a female crew to complement them. He turned up Denette ""Missy D"" Scott and charged her with getting a group together. The final Melody Crew included Tanya ""Lady T"" Barns, a member of Kurtis Blow's crew and no small potato in the early rap world. <em>Don't Stop</em> includes one track from each crew, and they're each hugely entertaining slices of live-band disco rap that plays nicely alongside Sugar Hill's early sides. Yisrael attempted to shop Missy Dee's ""Missy Missy Dee"", but never came to satisfactory terms with any prospective label. In the process, he completely neglected the Fabulous 3 MCs, who left bitterly. After a few months of failing to find a home for the Missy Dee track, Yisrael simply moved on, leaving the Melody Crew to break up on its own.
    </p>
<p>
    At this point, Redd entered the fold and Yisrael brought on veteran performer Arnie Love, pairing him with two Lovettes for a clutch of fantastic disco-funk tracks. ""Breakout"" has a sick rhythm track, deft arrangement, and outstanding instrumental hook, ""Invisible Wind"" springs from a barreling, horn-laden intro into a sharp if somewhat poorly mixed disco jam, and the other offerings follow in a similar vein. If success was as simple as making a good recording, we'd all know who Arnie Love was, but Jeremiah Yisrael apparently neglected to promote and distribute the handful of Arnie Love 12""s that were produced, though it could have been considered progress that they were pressed at all. Love fell quickly into the rearview mirror as Yisrael threw himself into his next singer, Jackie Stoudemire.
    </p>
<p>
    If you know the name, it's because she had a club hit in 1994 with ""Appreciate"", long after her association with Tap ended. During her time with Tap, she never even sniffed a niche chart. She was an associate of Slick Rick and Dana Dane, but Yisrael didn't try her out on any rap songs, instead sticking with the late-period disco he'd recorded with Arnie Love. He even resurrected a few songs from his work with Love, including ""Invisible Wind"". Her version is much slicker and far more chart-ready, but it wasn't to be: Stoudemire had been made to join Yisrael's temple, and clearly wasn't interested in its message of women's subservience to men. Though they continued to record in spite of this, producing the super-smooth choral disco track ""Guilty"" and the funky would-be floor-filler ""Don't Stop Dancin'"".
    </p>
<p>
    A few Stoudemire 12""s were pressed, but true to form, flopped spectacularly from a lack of promotion and distribution. Redd became a victim of the AIDS epidemic in 1983, taking his sure hand in the studio with him. Yisrael simply didn't have the skill at a mixing board he needed to continue, and he dismissed Stoudemire. Love was still around but frustrated that he was clearly going nowhere. He ultimately changed his performing name and jumped ship, scoring a very minor hit with a song called ""I'm Out of Your Life"". Yisrael had just a few more trips to the studio in him, for a few ballads and an anti-drug rap song, all deemed unworthy of inclusion here in the liners.
    </p>
<p>
    All told, it's kind of remarkable that any good music came out of the Tap story. On paper, it looks like a classic case of ambition exceeding ability, and on the business end it certainly was that. But on the musical end, enough things coalesced just right to create a unique body of work that's only now being properly exposed. Most of the recordings are endearingly rough, and the wild story and generous artwork that accompany it give it a more coherent feel than it had even in real life.

It's a madcap hybrid of jump-rope pop and baroque chamber music that draws a zigzagging line between Arthur Russell, Young Marble Giants, the Homosexuals, and outlying points. And it does this while remaining direly infectious: no mean feat, in a lineage prone to prioritizing experimentation over user-friendliness.</p><p>
    If the record sounds like a remarkably authentic reconstruction of the wide-eyed, freewheeling energy that attended the lo-fi British post-punk of the early 1980s, it's because Alig Pearce is no newcomer to this music-without-borders thing. During post-punk's first indefinable wave, he was always on the periphery of the zeitgeist with his rotating ensemble Family Fodder. He collaborated with This Heat and recorded in their practice space. He released an early single on Small Wonder, the same label that first issued Bauhaus's ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" and the Cure's ""Killing an Arab"". He flipped the mandatory dub and tape-manipulation experiments on Family Fodder's debut, <em>Monkey Banana Kitchen</em>, and beyond the mandatory reunions, they were done by 1983.</p><p>
    That Idol Fodder unites Pearce with Darlini Singh-Kaul, the daughter of Family Fodder vocalist Dominique Levillain, roots the album even more firmly in Cold War-era aesthetic rebellion. While Alig has remained active over the past couple of decades, Idol Fodder most overtly picks up where Family Fodder left off, exploring ways to make the baroque go pop. <em>Bäbytalk </em>is dominated by peppy sing-song vocals and deep, dramatic string rhythms, but each track delights with its creative deployment of these cornerstones and surprising embellishments. On ""The Onliest Thing"", Pearce and Singh-Kaul's twinned vocal lines ride a steadily sawing, bowed chord, and beyond an electric guitar bridge and some handclaps, all of the track's considerable interest resides in the contrast between the jackbooted strings and the fluid vocal line. It complements, yet in no way predicts, the next track, ""Earlimusix"", an inward-spiraling meditation for reed instruments. This is a band that knows how to milk one good idea for all of its undiluted worth.
    </p><p>
<em>Bäbytalk</em> is the sixth installment in the Pregnancy Series co-curated by Slender Means and States Rights, and its baby-centric theme represents a literal take on the series' ambiguous concept. Idol Fodder thankfully avoid ""wittle bitty snoogy ookums"" kinda talk, but they come close on ""The Onliest Thing"", a pledge of fealty to a newborn. The iron-banded durability of the track saves it from undue preciousness, and while the baby-theme isn't developed that interestingly, it never gets in the way of the diverse, sharp songwriting. ""Strangest Games"" is a jet-black noir for creeping percussion, funerary vocals, and gloaming strings flecked with reversed glissandos; hot on its heels is ""Infamy"", a tumbling, crispy-fried pop rock ditty. Singh-Kaul's bouncing-ball vocal melody on ""Analyze my Life?"" finds a perfect analogue in a robust jew's harp rhythm, and on ""Death and the Maiden"", Pearce sounds like Stuart Murdoch fronting the Kronos Quartet. The outsized charisma of the musicians holds their stylistic wanderlust fast at the seams, and their steadfast refusal to decide what kind of band they are reminds us of a cultural moment when to do so was considered tantamount to creative suicide.

New Pornographers albums always make room for a couple of tracks spotlighting Dan Bejar or Neko Case, but those two have their equally prominent solo projects as outlets. Hell, even lead Porno Carl Newman felt the need to release something under his own name. As for rest of the busy bunch, Newman's niece Kathryn Calder plays in the Immaculate Machine, John Collins aids Bejar in Destroyer, Kurt Dahle recently played drums on Chris Walla's solo bow, and Blaine Thurier makes movies.</p><p>
    Which brings us to New Pornographers guitarist Todd Fancey, who has his own solo project, not very creatively but still appropriately enough called Fancey. Fancey's 2004 debut was unabashed in its affection for 1970s soft rock, and listening to it you can hear why there might not be room for Fancey's tracks in the New Pornographers. Unlike many side projects, Fancey sounds nothing like the main gig, save for his love of pop and ear for pleasant chord progressions.</p><p>
    Fancey has already begun work on a third album, but in the meantime there's album number two, <em>Schmancey</em>, which was released last fall. <em>Schmancey</em> offers more of the same AM rock, stuff that goes down smooth but doesn't exactly rock the boat (and we're talking yacht). Still, a few exposures to the tight harmonies of ""Lost in Twilight"" or the mildly subversive (ELO by way of Steely Dan) ""Blue Star""-- a breezy paean to taking drugs--  and you're likely to ask permission to come aboard. </p><p>
    If that boat metaphor seems cheesy, wait until you hear the music, always well-crafted and rife with twisted (if subtle) lyrical details. Heck, songs like the country rock-lite ""Fader"", ""Heaven's Way"", or the disco-on-downers ""Feels Like Dawn""-- while perfectly produced in glorious state-of-the-art (circa 35 years ago) hi-fi-- sound like they should be played at low volume, the better to replicate an elevator's hidden sound system or the thin murmur of an old transistor radio behind the front desk as you check into a cheap hotel. But the kitsch factor isn't always a bad thing, since Fancey's aforementioned affection is certainly infectious. This is innocent appropriation, short on smarmy irony but long on mellow tunes, music made to be enjoyed, forgotten, then rediscovered years down the line as more effective (and affecting) than the soundtracks to all those long cross country car rides may have seemed at the time. It's thrift-store chic, music that smells a tad of mildew and mold but which brings a smile to your face all the same.</p></div>"|11395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11395-schmancey/|6.9|Joshua Klein

    There's nothing the least bit wrong with the constituent parts of Magnetic Morning. Sam Fogarino hails from Interpol, where his fierce, punchy drumming tends to sell songs every bit as much as the hooks do-- and as the eldest of the bunch, he's probably also the most likely to know a lot about the 1990s shoegazer acts they occasionally borrow from. Then there's Adam Franklin, who actually <em>is</em> from a 90s shoegazer act: Swervedriver, whose albums added a touch of hard-rock bombast to a scene that was often a lot more comfortable, pillowy, and dreamy. The two were introduced in New York by a mutual friend, and set about making music together-- deep, dark, spacious rock music-- and...</p><p>
    Well, it's turned out awfully bland, is the thing. This EP seems to suffer from the problem that happens with a lot of very professional rock guys, where loads of attention get paid to subtleties and technical work-- the right guitar tone, the deep ""feel"" of the drum groove, the space and reverb in the production-- but a giant vacuum gets left around it: There's plenty of tastefulness, but not much in the way of hooks, movement, tension, spice, stand-out songwriting, stand-out <em>style</em>, stimulation, inspiration, or engagement value for the listener. (And that list could have been longer.) These songs let Fogarino drop into drumming with a lot more nuance than the boxy drive of Interpol, and Franklin surrounds that with all manner of drizzly, sweeping guitar tones. Chord sequences always turn in the smart direction; transitions always get scripted with the fluidity of people who know what they're doing. But apart from ""Don't Go to the Dream State"", which takes on an intriguingly spooky 1960s movie-soundtrack feel, this stuff just plods, like a high-minded band still missing a frontman.</p><p>
    Which is odd: Franklin <em>is</em> a frontman, and yet the vocals really are a problem-- a kind of muddy, meandering moan that's unlikely to excite even Swervedriver fans. That band usually brought enough edge and speed to the music that Franklin's low-energy mumble was an ideal fit; pair it with poorly focused melodies and this nondescript lumbering, though, and it has a hard time carrying the weight. This makes for some odd results-- say, the way the instrumental reconfiguration of their song ""Cold War Kids"" (yeah, no, really) feels more engaging than the vocal version, or the way their cover of the Kinks' ""The Way Love Used to Be"" feels vague and aimless, despite their having punched up the original with tricky drumming and clearer organization.
    </p>
<p>
    This is only an EP we're talking about here-- including a cover and some reconfiguring of a feature song-- so maybe it's not a lot to judge by; maybe they have the makings of a decent album tucked away somewhere. On the other hand, these two surely had some idea their pedigrees would get them plenty of attention from the first release: If they had better cards than these, you'd think they'd want to lead with them, right?

Halfway through the record, the stage becomes an outright battlefield, the kick drum transforms into an earthquake, the bass apes a typhoon, and all four Minnesotans eventually go down fighting, only to be reunited at the three-quarter mark. Back to work in 2008, the Constellations get topical--spurred by global warming, the quartet fight famine with fistfuls of flames, and that's <em>not</em> on the song called ""Flames and Rain"". So the Plastic Constellations are without a doubt the most disaster-archetype-fixated non-metal band of the past 10 years.</p><p>
    It was as wobbly 14-year-olds that this band started, and they've since been slowed by the hydra of four years of college-related sabbaticals and a recently declared ""indefinite hiatus on the horizon."" Their jagged turn through post-punk has now spanned more than a decade, and their Drive Like Jehu/Refused/Les Savy Fav/Fugazi shrapnel finally, in their relative maturity, sounds a lot like it did one album prior-- a first. The back of the Plastic Constellations baseball card will now forever read that the band gang tackles a ""la la la"" chorus better than a thousand Murder by Deaths, alliterates with the best of 'em, and channels cabaretish gothic horror with more conviction than either than Fall Out Boy or MCR.</p><p>
    The record starts with a drawn-out gang vocal and ends with a drawn-out
    gang vocal: first they escape from their boring lives (""Stay that
    Way""), then they make a bunch of friends and call it a day (""So Many
    Friends""), presumably a more or less career-arc summary that could
    apply to every band ever. Throughout <em>We Appreciate You</em>, the Constellations gather hopefully in the night, post up on rooftops and in fortresses, get nostalgic for the basements of their past, and fall in love with the very same flames they'd with whom they'd just been fighting. Then they realize they have only one life to live and so stop sleeping, find some answers and, in the finale, gather in the backyard for first day of the rest of their lives. (Coincidentally, this plot is identical to that of Be Your Own Pet's <em>Get Awkward</em>, romantic subplots and all.)</p><p>
    When <em>Crusades</em> came out in 2006, the Constellations got lumped in with the Pearls &amp; Brass and Swords of the world, but you don't get the sense anybody in the Plastic Constellations ever listened to much metal. The sidewinding guitar at the beginning of ""Disastrophe"" is more Jehu than Jesu, and ""Perched on a Porch"" starts with a tangled drum creep that could've been cribbed right off a UOA record. The band's general dynamic tilt is a trebly scream-- they may even get a bit teary on the Native Nod-ish ""Heat Knocker""-- and ""Floated Down and Flew Around"" has a ska-climatic horn outro, hardly tough guy stuff. ""We are Genius Millionaires"" is a bedroom-recorded piano interlude, a rueful joke I presume about the wisdom of a career in rock. This site once puffed the band's style as a ""convincing facsimile of a high school punk show for the ages""; <em>We Appreciate You</em> is almost certainly an excellent version of a wave farewell, an <em>End Hits</em> in which the end actually hits. They do not sound afraid.<br/></p></div>"|11415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11415-we-appreciate-you/|7.1|Zach Baron

    Where do rappers go when they die? Or, where do critically heralded, next-big-things rappers go when their dreams don't pan out? They get jobs, get married, and, if we're lucky, join forces and cut an epic, heart-breakingly honest update on their lives every now and then. <em>The Show</em> is the debut album from eMC, which calls itself a ""supergroup""; many critics would concur. The lineup features 41-year-old Juice Crew vet Masta Ace-- who has five solid solo albums, a few scattered hits, and Eminem on his tip-- and old Lyricist Lounge hands Wordsworth and Punchline, who, like Ace, are former New Yorkers who don't live in the city anymore.</p><p>
    But the show is stolen (no pun intended) by the least known member of the group, Milwaukee MC Stricklin, whose high-pitched, sometimes spastic rhymes are laced with self-deprecation, naivety, and humor. I found him annoying for about five minutes, but now can't get enough of his giddy verses, like this one on ""Borrow You"": ""When I first saw you ma I was like/ 'Now, this a girl I can't mess with/ Out my league like them dudes I play chess with'/ Then I was like, 'What the hell, let me test it/ Hi, my name's Stricklin but you can call me interested/ You got a man, but he not like me'/ She said, 'Man? What, nigga? Yo, I got, like, three.'""</p><p>
    Sixteen meaty songs strong, the album is part slightly-fictionalized tour diary, part rumination on unrealized success and finding fun in the day-to-day. Its details are so mundane at times that those used to hip-hop melodrama may be taken aback. ""Got to town at like a quarter to three/ 3:30, still in the lobby, waiting on my room key/ 4:00, I'm in my room watching TV,"" Strick raps with comic urgency on the title track. Next, Ace tells us that he has stretched, showered, and shaved. They drive to the venue, do a sound check, and Strick takes a shit ""at 9:20."" They eat some chicken and then perform. That's it. It's a Sopranos-like non-ending, and Ladybug Mecca's robotic, GPS-voice chorus just makes the whole thing crazier.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Feel It"" sketches the group members' lives without self-pity or glorification. ""In this ice-cold world, better get ya'll coats/ I'm a husband, a father, and a football coach,"" raps Ace, and Strick adds: ""You might be sick of me complaining and hearing me sob/ But it's kind of hard trying to juggle my career and my job/ Cause whether it's the m-i-c or an IV/ They be calling me, 'Notorious EMT.'"" That's just sick, and Money Harm's chorus may well bring you to tears if your girl's not around.
    </p>
<p>
    The album's consistent, unpretentious beats have been culled from producers from all over the world (Croatia, the UK, Houston). Standouts include Quincey Tones' layered, r&amp;b flavored jams, ""Traffic"" and ""U Let Me Grow"", The ARE's ""Leak It Out"", a disco and golden era-hybrid banger, and Nicolay on ""E.M.C. (What It Stand For?)"", a rattlesnake shake charmer. But with so many disarmingly candid confessions on the disc, it's sometimes hard to concentrate on the music. Only the rhymes from Punchline, who said in an interview that he brings ""that 'nigga' element"" to the group, contain elements of rap's typically incredible braggadocio (""I'm with these two chicks, about to cop me some kicks""). But even he is honest more often than not. ""I wish I could spend my life in reverse,"" he says, suddenly, on ""Feel It"". Still, ""I'm here, after the smoke clears, like a firefighter.""

    Capillary Action's debut album, <em>Fragments</em>, was an instrumental guitar showcase brimming with
    virtuosity and violent rhythmic shifts. I think I could be forgiven for
    expecting more of the same from <em>So Embarrassing</em>,
    but holy confounded expectations, is this ever a different album from its
    predecessor. Are there still wicked rhythmic turns, hints of jazz, and
    mind-bending guitar runs? Sure, but this time they're all subordinated to
    songs-- the first thing you hear on this album is guitarist Jonathan Pfeffer's
    voice, singing over a breakneck but fairly straightforward rock beat.</p><p>
    Pfeffer is now clearly playing with the tension between
    straight-ahead indie rock and spastic, mathy composition. Opener ""Gambit"" has
    those basic verses, but breaks them up with ragged odd-metered riffs,
    alternating in a way that makes each new 4/4 verse sound even more propulsive.
    A similar approach guides the album's best song, ""Elevator Fuck"". The band uses
    a string synth and what I think is a real trombone to inject sweetly melodic
    but rhythmically strange phrases between verse lines that seem as though they
    should disrupt the flow of the song but don't.</p><p>
    Whereas the band's first album reserved the middle for its
    most introspective moments, this one gives us the aggressive experiment ""Badlands"", which features the sounds of Pfeffer's breathing
    cut up and made into a brutal rhythm. It's one of several tracks to use extreme
    dynamic range to great effect. ""Pocket Protection Is Essential"", for instance,
    sets quietly melodic sections against the heaviest, loudest bits on the
    album-- it's genuinely startling the first time the shouted vocals and pounding
    drums crash in, and not much less startling each time after
    that. Closer ""Self-Released"" uses all these techniques to create a collage of a
    song that has the pacing of a brawl, with quiet moments to catch your breath
    followed by furious passages of pounding rhythm and dissonant swells.
    </p>
<p>
    The album as a whole extends the collage feel, with each
    track flowing easily into the next to make a kind of suite. The songs aren't
    inseparable from each other, though; quite a few of them work well on their
    own, and this owes much to the band's overall stylistic re-orientation.
    Pfeffer's even, baritone vocals add a strong melodic center for the listener
    and put the instrumental freakouts in context.<em> So Embarrassing</em> is a bold change in direction for Capillary
    Action, but one that pays off as well as one could hope.

    Luke Pritchard has gone on record saying that <em>Konk </em>is his band's ""pop album,"" and initially, I thought he was just talking a gang of shit. Musically, the Kooks have never been the toughest nut to crack, and on the surface, this is a work obsessed with a sense of lineage-- their handle factually references David Bowie, but the album title slyly and phonetically conjures the Kinks, the band these guys try hardest to emulate.  And to top it off, the record's namesake is the London studio in which it was recorded; it just so happens the owner is a certain Mr. Ray Davies.  Similar scenarios: Lenny Kravitz's <em>Electric Ladyland</em>.  Oasis' <em>Abbey Road.</em></p><p>
    But it turns out Pritchard is right after all, because the group's well-selling debut <em>Inside In/Inside Out </em>was a pop album, and the only real difference between itself and <em>Konk </em>is that this one doesn't have a song called ""Jackie Big Tits"" on it.  More accurately, it's a <em>Brit</em>pop album, meaning it's more than content to offer fingers up to the Albion-extolling <em>NME</em> altar with the same old knucklehead boys-club ethos that, to paraphrase Homer Simpson, likes its beer cold, TV loud, and homosexuals <em>flaming</em>.</p><p>
    Take ""Do You Wanna"", which nicks from the Franz Ferdinand song of the sorta-same name with an audacity that's almost admirable, but unlike Alex Kapranos and co. the Kooks have no use for playful ambiguity.  ""Do you wanna make love to me?"" asks Pritchard instead, but it's obviously a rhetorical question, because this guy's a rockstar now and you know the drill-- ""I <em>know </em>you want to make love to me,"" he says, but it doesn't come off as Rod Stewart swagger so much as the kind of ugly, self-mythologizing groupie bait we're used to from Kings of Leon.
    </p>
<p>
    Nope, these guys ain't talkin' 'bout love...except when they are.  Which is most of the time.  Pritchard has also said ""we make songs for girls,"" certainly a fine goal and probably the purpose of nine out of 10 bands at least, except that most of <em>Konk </em>feels targeted towards some imagined audience instead of being borne of real inspiration.  Following ""Do You Wanna"" is ""Gap"", which peppers Tony Hoffer's overactive strings with come-ons like ""please don't go,"" and ""I miss you and I love you and that's true""-- with any modicum of self-awareness, it could've been a lacerating parody of the kind of person who'll say anything to get in your pants. By chopping off several limbs from the Darkness' ""Love Is Only a Feeling""-- the righteous soloing, the lovely pastoral arrangement, Justin Hawkins' ability to totally nail the hook that simultaneously sends up and transcends power balladry-- ""Love It All"" starts us back at square one, offering a sort of lunkheaded acoustic version of the Rapture song of almost the<em> </em>same name.    
    </p>
<p>
    If you hadn't gotten the point by then, what does ""Stormy Weather"" feel like?  ""It feels like love, love, love.""  By the time that's done, these guys are so drained that they attack ""Sway"" like <em>Our Earthly Pleasures </em>at half mast, ushering in a mostly unmemorable final quarter. At least they're knowledgeable enough to frontload <em>Konk </em>with the most enjoyable tracks, including lead single ""Always Where I Need to Be"", which wisely eschews any of Pritchard's wolf cries with a wordless hook and zippy guitars. But while the vague send-up of an upwardly mobile ""Mr. Maker"" is catchy enough and aimed directly at <em>Parklife </em>pastiche, it just exposes how the rest of this record has a hard-on where Damon Albarn has a heart or a brain.
    </p>
<p>
    And that will be more than enough for some people, but it shouldn't be with bands like Los Campesinos!, These New Puritans, the Long Blondes, and Glasvegas re-invigorating British indie and challenging the <em>NME</em>'s necropolis of complacent, reactionary, and outmoded ideas of ""doing things the right way.""  For self-professed straight-shooters like the Kooks, anyone whose greatest influences aren't sex, drugs, and dead white British bands might as well be some blogger in their mom's basement, but <em>Konk</em> feels like a mere cowardly act, a TPS report from a band that strives to be nothing more than British pop's ultimate company men.

    Last year, Frank Black returned to his Pixies-era stage
    name, Black Francis, for the first time in his solo career. It seemed to be a
    way of marking a change in direction, steering away from the
    rootsy rock of the Catholics and his sedate recordings with legendary session
    musicians and back toward surging, punk-inspired weird-rock. His first album
    after the change, <em>Bluefinger</em>, didn't
    quite get it all right, but it was a good first step, and <em>SVN FNGRS</em>, a mini-LP that grew out of the sessions for a <em>Bluefinger</em> B-side, takes one more step
    in the right direction. It was recorded in less than a week with just a bassist and
    a drummer, and it sounds like Black for the most part just let things come to
    him and made the most natural record he could.</p><p>
    In seven songs and about 20 minutes, he briefly touches on nearly every territory he's explored in his career. The record is
    led off by the oddest thing Black has done since the mid-1990s, the funked-up
    freak out ""The Seus"", which finds him kind of rapping in places and generally
    stumbling through a noble experiment with pretty unsatisfying results. ""Seus""
    is never defined for us-- I was sort of hoping it would turn out to be a tribute
    to Doug Seus, trainer and owner of Hollywood
    animal actor Bart the Bear-- but Black's heartily yelped ""I am the great Seus!""
    refrain doesn't seem to worry over it.</p><p>
    After tripping out of the gate, though, the record picks
    itself up nicely with ""Garbage Heap""-- the best song he's done in
    ages. I don't think it's a coincidence that it's also the most Pixies-ish thing
    he's done in ages, apart from reuniting with the Pixies. The chorus is
    astounding, with a brilliant, doubled vocal melody featuring Black at the
    bottom of his range, in sharp contrast to the chorused falsetto he employs in
    the verse. It's a sharp reminder of what was so damn great about the Pixies in
    the first place. Their sense of songwriting dynamics was amazing, and it's been
    missing from a lot of his solo work-- it's great to hear it again. 
    </p>
<p>
    The rest falls into that uneasy space between his Pixies and
    Catholics days. The vowel-infused title track is great, and with
    a fuzz guitar it could be some lost 60s garage artifact. Black's sung-spoken
    verses and catchy, all-out chorus reminds me a bit of the La De Das' ""How Is
    the Air Up There?"" ""The Tale of Lonesome Fetter"" leans toward the Pixies side
    of things, riding a weird little groove in the opening verse, but never goes
    for the jugular, preferring to drop the rhythm entirely for its oddball chorus.
    ""When They Come to Murder Me"" and ""Half Man"" both retreat to roots rock, and
    ""Murder Me"" does it well, with a few big hooks-- it would have been the best song
    on a couple Catholics albums. Black isn't all the way back to his Black Francis form,
    but he's close. If he has a few more songs like ""Garbage
    Heap"" rattling around in his head, I hope we get to hear them on his next
    album, and as much as ""The Seus"" fails in its own right I hope he keeps going
    out on those limbs, because in the distant past that's where he found some of
    his best ideas.

It was the follow-up to a major hit album but cut OMD's audience by 90%. It was a mix of new songs, reworked B-Sides, and ""found sound"" experiments, which promised to mix ""ABBA and Stockhausen."" It was named after wartime camouflage boats. It was appallingly reviewed. In fact I don't think you could design a record more ripe for revisionism: It's got a strong backstory, it's as ambitious as it is catchy and it even has a gorgeous Peter Saville sleeve. Luckily, you don't need a contrarian streak to love it.</p><p>
    The 25 years between release and this reissue have done <em>Dazzle Ships</em> the world of good: The weaknesses of 1983 don't seem that way today. Nobody now cares how nerdily singer Andy McCluskey dressed or <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=Jll8cMA_CIY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>how gawkily he danced</strong></a>, and while his bare-nerved sea lion yelp was a liability in an era of chilly reserve it sounds messily, modishly emotional now. More importantly, <em>Dazzle Ships</em> seems a lot less radical than it did on release: The Kraftwerk records and musique concrète it obviously borrowed from have been more fully absorbed into pop music. You'll have heard uglier noises than the title track's mechanical grindings and foghorn blurts, and stranger constructions than the layered robot voices on ""ABC Auto-Industry"". Those songs won't sound like clumsy shock-tactics to a new listener, just more parts in the album's sad, effective synth-pop collage.</p><p>
<em>Dazzle Ships</em> was born out of writer's block, and given the record's jumbled origins it's dangerous to claim too much thematic consistency. But the various interludes-- as well as the ships and robots, there are radio callsigns and sampled speaking clocks-- are crucial in building coherence and the transitions from experiment to song are well-handled. Those servile robot voices sound a lot more sinister alongside the grinning scissor-dance that opens the record's hookiest track, ""Genetic Engineering"". When the clocks on ""Time Zones"" unify and their final bleeps announce mournful closer ""Of All the Things We've Made"", it's like McCluskey has stepped outside history for a moment, to deliver a gloomy summing-up. </p><p>
    The passing of time has had an impact on <em>Dazzle Ships</em>' content as well as its style. This isn't a concept album so much as an album made by a concept band-- all of OMD's early work digs into ideas about history and technology, and <em>Dazzle Ships</em> is no exception. But time has a tendency to turn technology into history. As ""This Is Helena"" clatters perkily along a voice chirps ""This is Helena! Music for your tape recorder!"" The first CD players went on sale six months before this album: Some of the reissue's buyers won't even have seen a tape recorder. ""This Is Helena"" now sounds as archaic as ""Telegraph""'s rousing celebration of the dawn of a mass communication age. Similarly, <em>Dazzle Ships</em> used to juxtapose World War imagery with the contemporary ideological struggle between communism and capitalism: now both are historical, and the sorrow in a song like ""International"" is the sadness of old sepia photographs. </p><p>
<em>Dazzle Ships</em>' reference points span the 20th century, and the record works today as a time-capsule farewell to it. Even the poppiest songs sound endearingly old-fashioned and awkward, more clockwork than digital, and the remaster is faithful to this machine-age charm. The extra tracks don't add much-- they're B-Sides to B-Sides, after all, with the extended ""Genetic Engineering"" 12"" the only standout. But history has done its own remix job on <em>Dazzle Ships</em>, and the result is a richer, more unified album than anyone in 1983 could have imagined.</p></div>"|11363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11363-dazzle-ships/|8.4|Tom Ewing

But any other degree of advancement would feel inappropriate, since this group's music deals in small steps and minute shifts. This can make for a sleepy listen-- sometimes it even sounds like the trio has drifted off into musical unconsciousness. But more often this album is like a quiet dream, filled with moods and images that linger past the end of each song.</p><p>
    That effect combined with the fact that Autistic Daughters are on Kranky might imply their music is pure ambience. But the trio is actually a song-based entity, relying on vocals, guitars, drums, and some modest electronic effects. The seven tunes here sometimes evoke the soothing drift of Kranky stalwarts like Stars of the Lid. But they're closer sonically to the slow melodies of Low, the soft glitch of the Books, or even Wilco's mellower moments (the alluring bent of Dean Roberts' voice at times recalls Jeff Tweedy).</p><p>
    The miniaturist feel of <em>Uneasy Flowers</em> is enhanced by Roberts' lyrics, which explore ideas in subtle shades. Phrases and images recur, tracing the outline of an enigmatic character named Rehana. Through clever repetitions of terms like ""rain,"" ""gin,"" and ""value judgment,"" Roberts paints an impressionist portrait that makes surreal sense. On the title track, over chopped snare hits, he describes an elusive ""it""-- ""tell your brother it's a balancing act""; ""it makes our laughter more easily stomachable""-- without ever fully revealing his subject. Later, on the sparse ""Bird in the Curtain"" and the minimal ""Hotel Exeter Dining Room"", Roberts slyly dodges meaning, singing about uncertainty and awkwardness with apt imprecision.</p><p>
    Musically, the songs on <em>Uneasy Flowers</em> are skeletal, offering bare bones where more impatient bands might pile on sonic flesh. Sparse and measured, each tune forms gradually, letting its elements grow into each other like ivy on a wall. This encourages the listener to connect dots and color in shapes that may never actually be there. Not every tune rewards the effort, but enough do, especially ""Gin Over Sour Milk"", the album's masterful midpoint.

    You could argue that Sydney, Australia's Naked on the Vague are a bit
    of a 1980s-retro band, but only if you're thinking about the dark side
    of the decade-- no wave instead of new wave. Their first full length, <em>The Blood Pressure Sessions</em>,
    is mired in Reagan-era dread. Released last year on the Australian
    label Dual Plover and now given a U.S. vinyl treatment by
    Siltbreeze, the record drips with hollow contempt and dull scorn. It's
    the Southern Hemisphere's dark photo-negative answer to Times New
    Viking's <em>Paisley Reich</em>.</p><p id=""cgbh"">
    Comprised of keyboardist Lucy Cliché, bassist Matthew
    P. Hopkins, and a
    drum machine, Naked on the Vague churn out stripped-down and monotonous
    post-punk. The rhythms are primitive; the most animated songs rely on
    little more than the incessant thud of a bass drum. Likewise, any
    pretense of harmony is chucked out the window. As a result, it's easy
    draw a straight line from a Naked on the Vague song like ""All
    Aboard""-- with it's slanted riff and stone-age drum loop-- to the
    esoteric scuzz of the past. But although Naked on the Vague wear some
    influences on their sleeves-- whether that's downtown noise, Flying Nun
    Records, or Huggy Bear LPs-- <em>The Blood Pressure Sessions</em> is more than just skilled homage. The band's take on post-punk is familiar but also tight and contemporary.</p><p id=""ps:t"">
    Naked on the Vague aren't abrasive in the Dead C sense, out to fully lobotomize their audience with skree and
    treble. In fact, when compared to the production value of other records
    released on Siltbreeze-- a label whose reputation was built on shrill
    hiss and white noise-- <em>The Blood Pressure Sessions</em>
    is startlingly clear and intensely silent. ""All Aboard"" is sheared down
    to the most meager of ingredients-- one circular drumbeat, a bass riff,
    and a and a malnourished keyboard melody. There's nothing else, not even amp hiss. But all of the negative space enhances the pervading sense of desolation. None of the instruments resonate and each lyric hangs in the air for only a moment before vanishing back into the void, as if the band are performing in a vacuum chamber. 
    </p>
<p id=""r7o:"">
    Naked on the Vague also have a penchant for dubby textures
    that have
    more in common with the current Fuck It Tapes school of psychedelic
    music than to no wave. ""Brown Sun/Sydney Lane Road"" is six-minutes of
    clanking abstract percussion and flat vocal drones. There are accordion
    trills and lonesome trumpet farts thrown into the mix, but the sounds
    are hardly lush. Rather, they're restrained, like something from a
    claustrophobic horror-movie soundtrack. These moments alone don't
    divide them from the weirdos of yesteryear. Where no wave had a marked
    self-important streak, Naked on the Vague are self-aware. Although
    dark, their lyrics
    seem to drift around at the edge of black comedy. ""Horse, he's sick/
    Horse so sick,"" sings Lucy Cliché during the appropriately titled
    ""The Horse, He's Sick"". We're talking some distance from Michael Gira
    yelling, ""All I can do is kill"" in straight-faced earnest.
    </p>
<p id=""r7o:"">
    It's stupid to dismiss or embrace Naked on the Vague as merely the product of their influences. <em>The Blood Pressure Sessions</em> is an enhancement of an idea started a long time ago. During the 80s,
    bands responded to poverty, vacuous culture, and bad government with
    music that was appropriately nihilistic. It's not surprising
    that Naked on the Vague have been able to tap into that mindset 20
    years later; the more things change, the more they stay
    the same.

    I suppose the existence of <em>H.A.A.R.P. </em>is proof enough that Muse hardly needs validation from highfalutin' music critics, what with our five-dollar words and readers who're just hoping they get some good Radiohead  or Queen cracks out of this review. Live albums are usually just victory laps, contract obligations, or cash grabs (sometimes all three), but this could still be your make-or-break Muse record: Even if the words ""Apocalypse Please"" or ""Map of the Problematique"" mean nothing to you, odds are you've been told Muse are ""pretty good live."" And they're a different kind of ""pretty good live"" than you usually hear us talk about here, because Muse make superhero music, and if you're going to offer declarations like ""Tonight we can truly say/ Together we're invincible,"" there are few settings more appropriately comic-book than the one for this CD/DVD set: a twice-over sold-out Wembley Stadium.</p><p>
    Muse recall some of the more arena-ready rock of the 70s, but charmingly fall short of such hyphenates as ""cock-"" or ""prog-""; their body of work is completely bereft of even the faintest hint of lemon-squeezing, and while showy, their musicianship services their songs: solos are prominent but rarely indulgent, the sort of challenges that precocious teen guitarists want to emulate and probably can in their bedrooms (a <em>big</em> reason for Muse's success).</p><p>
    That said, skeptics will still find the audio disc of <em>H.A.A.R.P. </em>to be tough sledding. If you never cared much for the ""change the world by taking it on"" attitude of songs like ""Time Is Running Out"" or ""Invincible"", piping in some crowd noise isn't going to change your mind.  <em>H.A.A.R.P. </em>leans heavily on a certain type of Muse song, and it's hard not to notice more than a few compositional similarities: singer/guitarist/piano man Matthew Bellamy never met a ""Thunderstruck""-style pull-off riff that he couldn't use for an intro, the rhythm section's liveliest setting is a steady motorbike chug, and the melodies are often built atop vaguely Latin minor chord progressions that switch to a ripe major nearly the same way every time (a Muse hallmark since ""Muscle Museum"" and ""Uno"" from <em>Showbiz</em>).  And though the Radiohead comparisons don't really hold water anymore, the <em>Yorke </em>ones do; Bellamy sounds impressive having his falsetto blast over grand canyons of stadium air, but he relies almost exclusively on those unmistakable melismatics-- ""Micro Cuts"" is one of those interminable howlers that makes you wish Jeff Buckley's <em>Grace </em>never existed. 
    </p>
<p>
    Even so, there's no denying that a format this huge and an undertaking this ambitious is what Muse has been building towards over a decade worth of releases; <em>H.A.A.R.P. </em>makes their two previous live releases sound like practice runs. As Pitchfork's Sam Ubl conceded in a review of <em>Black Holes and Revelations</em>, ""Take a Bow"" is the ""kind of song that could level an arena,"" and as the closer of <em>H.A.A.R.P.</em>, this proves to be true.  Moreso than most bands, Muse feel limited by the space of a studio or a compact disc.  Freed from its original casting as <em>BH&amp;R</em>'s overwrought ender, ""Knights of Cydonia"" opens the disc after a recitation of Prokofiev's ""Dance of the Knights""  (yeah, I know), dropping the whinnying horse effects, toning down the brass, and instead devoting itself to a multi-part rumble that recalls ""Achilles' Last Stand"".  The stairstep piano riff that spikes the gorgeous ""Starlight"" could pass for a ""Speed of Sound"" rip in your local trainer shop (and, come to think of it...), but when you can hear the space between Bellamy and 90,000+ singing along like it's the biggest Dashboard Confessional concert ever, it chariots across the sky.   
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, the visual elements of Muse's live show means the CD can't compete with the dazzling, colorfully shot DVD, which comes included with the physical package at no extra cost.  Much of the concert experience is rendered flat on audio, particularly since the band's sound is far more imposing than its personality. Bellamy offers mostly polite and totally sincere stage banter in response to the constant ""I LOVE YOU!""'s, along the lines of ""you're beautiful!,"" ""are you having a good time,"" and if the band had a sense of humor, I'd imagine introducing ""Supermassive Black Hole"" with ""this next song is for anyone who likes a little r&amp;b"" was a cheeky nod to <em>Rattle &amp; Hum</em>.  
    </p>
<p>
    It might be hard for those of us in the States to understand how Muse became the first rock act to sell out the new Wembley-- when they toured in the U.S. last year, they were the opener for My Chemical Romance. I'm not sure whether that says more about Muse's popularity or MCR's, but those are the kind of groups Muse needs to be taken in the context of, and when compared the likes of Gerard Way's band, Fall Out Boy, the Killers, or Panic at the Disco, grandiosity seems like more of a natural fit for Muse than any of their American counterparts who often sound like they're using bombast as a way of numbing critics into submission or escaping emo into another dead-end of ego gratification. While many of the latter outfits try explicitly to create a concrete fourth-wall-busting narrative, Muse are more effective for implying the give and take-- they may just be following in the path of the Cure, the Doors, Rush, Pink Floyd, or even Led Zeppelin (I mean, you've seen <em>The Song Remains the Same</em>, right?), bands with similarly geeky and insular tendencies. In their case, Muse are the kind of act that rarely serves as an endpoint but more often makes teens fall in love with rock hard enough to explore it further.  And that's fucking important.  I mean, we can't all <em>start </em>with Radiohead.

    Again and again on <em>Red</em>, Guillemots singer Fyfe Dangerfield complains that he can't get the words out. He chases the moon, tries another drink to loosen his tongue, and moans about how life would be easier ""if I was half-drunk and mad."" Words are failing him-- they've got a whole song about it-- and whatever he's feeling, he can't get it out. This from the singer of the effusive, vivacious, and Mercury Prize-nominated <em>Through the Windowpane</em>, where his falsetto wails and declarations of love could not have been less abashed.  Dangerfield sang like he already <em>was</em> mad, as if he'd rather play the fool than miss a chance to give pleasure.  How did this guy hit a wall?</p><p>
    The simple answer is, Dangerfield has nailed romantic drama-- but this isn't a romantic album. The band has downplayed the sprawling orchestrations-- as well as Aristazabal Hawkes's sensuous upright bass-- to build a tighter, harder, more jarring sound. They're also sharing songwriting duties between all four members. The result is a stylistic trainwreck of psych- and Brit-pop, hectoring beats and shout-alongs, and by-the-book ballads. It's a classic sophomore slump-- and a total mess.</p><p>
    It's not that the songs are stinkers; most are fine, and a couple are fab. But a couple of clunkers and dysfunctional sequencing brings the whole record down. ""Kriss Kross"" startles the listener to happy attention with slogans and thundering beats, tempered by a dazzling chorus; first single ""Get Over It"" takes the same strategy to even better effect, changing Dangerfield's barks from a command to an invitation. But the album goes south early with ""Big Dog,"" an R&amp;B nod that trips over its own machismo. And the shrill ""Last Kiss"" is a total non-sequitor between ""Clarion"" and ""Cockateels"", two songs that swing all the way back to the fantastical end of their spectrum. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Clarion"" is a genuine puzzler, with a drippy rainbow palette of synths and beats that pop like psychedelic gum until the only voice of reason comes from a pipa (a Chinese stringed instrument). A killer chorus props up a meandering structure that peters out into a false ending, making it ultimately unsuccessful but totally irresistible the whole way through. ""Cockateels"", meanwhile, has the dizzy disco effervescence of a ""We're Here""-- judging by the train reference, it may even be a leftover from <em>Windowpane-- </em>and the keening, wordless Middle Eastern chant is the album's best hook. (It also proves how deftly they can appropriate any influence <em>except</em> the modern top 40.) 
    </p>
<p>
    After that it's a slow slide downhill, as the album's wind-down crawls across four songs. To their credit, for all their leftfield ideas-- dig the sudden drum'n'bass break or the closing typewriter sample in ""Don't Look Down"" -- Guillemots never sound ""clever."" And instead of winking and laughing their way through 1970s and 80s pop and disco, Guillemots have thoroughly internalized their sources; they don't show a single ironic impulse between them.  The problem isn't that the album's too strange or exotic; rather, it's too confining.  Guillemots cram themselves into awkward fits, and Dangerfield has to squeeze the hardest-- whether he's tying himself to a straightforward ballad instead of clamoring for the rooftops, or standing up for a fight when he's so much more comfortable slipping into a dream.  But kudos to the band for taking the half-baked idea over the easy kill every time; it's reason enough to stay tuned, even when they stumble.

As Elbow have morphed from ambitious but sterile art-rockers to something slightly more visceral, his singing-- equal parts Peter Gabriel and Talk Talk's Mark Hollis-- has been one of the few elements linking the Manchester band's varied output. It's also what's helped Elbow stick out a bit from the choirboy pack of Chris Martin, guy from Keane, et al. At the same time it's not a very rock'n'roll voice, which perhaps explains how, despite some degree of hype, Elbow have always fallen just shy of expectations.</p><p>
    Fitting, then, that ""Starlings""-- the first track on Elbow's fourth album <em>The Seldom Seen Kid</em>-- is all about expectations, or at least subverting them. The track begins with an intense cacophony before settling into a vaguely Polynesian groove; a sole orchestral stab blasts out as quickly as it disappears once again. It's a full two minutes before Garvey even sings, and by then one would be forgiven for thinking that, modest melody aside, expectation is all the suspensefully static track has to offer. Yet Elbow are album artists, first and foremost, and in that context it's hard to come up with a better way to ease into <em>The Seldom Seen Kid</em>. Indeed, the similarly exotic second track ""The Bones of You"", with its flamenco underpinnings and Gershwin coda, stands in stark contrast to its predecessor, and it's here that the benefits of Garvey's voice really come into play. Were he to rise to a pained falsetto, ""The Bones of You"" would invite endless comparisons to other, slightly more conspicuous British art-rock bands. That Garvey sounds so comfortable in his skin even as his band sheds its own from track to track helps thread the self-produced disc, suite-like.</p><p>
    There are no roman numerals to be found in <em>The Seldom Seen Kid</em>'s song titles, nor is there particularly dexterous playing to be heard from track to track, but that's not to discount the disc's mildly proggy vibe. The ebb and flow of the disc feels like it's advancing some unknowable plot, always the sign of a well sequenced disc but also the bridge between songs like the lovely ""Mirrorball"" and the bluesy (in the get-the-Led-out sense) ""Grounds for Divorce"". There, the song's lyrical and musical reputation are in keeping with the band's exploration of the static as well as blues traditions. It's a tragic drinking song where the protagonist loses himself in ""a hole in my neighborhood down which of late I cannot help but fall."" Less fancy-pants lyricists would have just said ""bar,"" but Garvey knows the value of a poetic line or two.  In typically ornate Garvey fashion, he's called ""An Audience with the Pope"" ""a Bond theme if Bond was from Bury and a recovering Catholic,"" but he could have just described it as Tom Waits doing 007.</p><p>
    The song is a rare autopilot moment on a disc that otherwise makes so much effort to skirt cliché. Anyone expecting ""Some Riot"" to reflect it's title is headed for disappointment-- the song could easily explode, but follows a different, more moving path instead-- and ""Weather to Fly"" is almost mantra-like in its simplicity. Yet while ""The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver"" begins much the same, it gives way to some subtle twists, turns, and escalations that push the track into dramatically fresh territory. On ""The Fix"", the twist is that guest Richard Hawley's croon vies with Garvey's voice as guide through the jazzy song, vaguely film score in its menace but pretty cool despite its half-familiarity.</p><p>
    The single ""One Day Like This"" sounds like just that-- a single-- with its faster gait and sunnier demeanor, buoyed by strings and massed vocals despite a deceptive but welcome surfeit of space in the mix, but per Elbow's own downbeat reputation, the album doesn't end there. That would be too easy. Instead, <em>The Seldom Seen Kid</em> ends with a bonus tribute to the title's inspiration, Manchester songwriter/troubadour/busker Bryan Glancy. Track down and browse the website dedicated to his memory and you'll likely wish you knew him. Listen to this absolutely beautiful tribute and you'll miss him like a best friend.<br/></p></div>"|11322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11322-the-seldom-seen-kid/|7.8|Joshua Klein

    De Novo Dahl debuted back in 2005 with <em>Cats &amp; Kittens</em>, a wildly ambitious double album that presented all of its songs twice in drastically altered forms, demonstrating a bold eclecticism. It was a fun record with a lot of alleys to explore and I still listen to it now and then. The thing about debuting like that is that it's hard to go even further on your second album, and so the Nashville band's sophomore offering, <em>Move Every Muscle, Make Every Sound</em>, is significantly pared back and more focused, leaning on the hooky power-pop sound that characterized disc one of the first album. They've also trimmed down from a sextet to a quintet.</p><p>
    That basic power-pop framework still has plenty of room for splashes of biting new wave synth, the occasional proggy flourish, a few disco-fied beats, and other touches that keep things interesting from song to song. It's much easier to absorb in just a few listens and is spiked with a few phenomenal high points. The opening two tracks are massive and immediate. ""Shout"" is like American Supergrass, with ooh-ing and aah-ing backup vocals, thick, r&amp;b-informed rhythm section playing and a ridiculously anthemic chorus whose lyrics nod, perhaps unintentionally, to Tears for Fears. The title of ""Heartbreaker"" is aspirational, as Joel J Dahl (aka Joel McAnulty) sings of his desire to crush another person romantically in a glammy croon that has you rooting for him to succeed. Matthew Hungate's wall of sunshine-drenched organ completes the sale.</p><p>
    De Novo Dahl does up-tempo very well-- you'd probably have to hate rock'n'roll not to fall for the under-two-minute blast of garage rock organ boisterous group singing that constitutes the new, beefier version of <em>Cats</em>' ""Be Your Man""-- but the variety of slower songs that dot the album have their moments as well. ""Marketplace"" is one of Dahl's finest moments melodically, as he follows the deliberately ascending bassline with a dramatic croon. The song is a stunning centerpiece for the album, and packs more emotional punch than ""Not to Escape"", the album's world-weary closer, which gets a little lost in its own haziness.
    </p>
<p>
    De Novo Dahl is a detail-oriented band, and they miss few chances to add an ornament or shift the dynamics of a song from a busy arrangement to one with just a few instruments. Even the amount of reverb is varied considerably within songs. ""New Hero"" has dry verses where Dahl does a swooning soul-man thing, but when he's joined by Serai Zeffiro's harmonies on the chorus, they're suddenly in Phil Spector's echo chamber, but it really helps to make the individual sections stand out in your memory. The core song of ""Wishful Thinking"" isn't even that memorable, but Zaffiro's backing vocals add hooks where there were none to shore it up.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
    Move Every Muscle, Make Every Sound </em>is a strong sophomore effort. Some of the sprawling ambition of Cats &amp; Kittens is certainly missed, but the focus present in its place and the plain old good songs they filled the record with ably compensate for that loss. Their sharpened focus and re-jiggered lineup have also given them the chance to really perfect their sound and fill it with the kind of details that keep a listener coming back.

But while their first EP recalled the swooning guitar-driven romanticism of artists like Jeff Buckley and early Radiohead, Colour Revolt seemed like a band who could pull it off. The sound felt familiar, but even as the singer reached for his downy-soft upper registers and the guitars choked in their own reverb, the songs had a grittier edge that was distinctive enough to transcend their influences. It's the same band on <em>Plunder, Beg and Curse</em>, but the debut full-length aims high and often misses. They laudably try to be a less predictable band than their forebears, but from the first song onward, it exceeds their reach.</p><p>
    ""Naked and Red"" starts with a low vocal, a bare guitar melody, and drums that can't wait for the moment of release, pounding out the bass on every beat. But rather than a big, easy chorus, the band punches in and out intermittently, veering quickly between excitable and languid, and not always in sync with each other-- In Colour Revolt's attempts to take the road less traveled, they seem to belie their better instincts. The slippery ""A Siren"" has riffs that are unpredictable without being memorable, and the vocals ranting without quite earning their catharsis. The distorted vocal and slow pace of ""Elegant View"" wants to simmer dangerously, but its thudding fuzz guitars simply plod, and the less said about the hoarse singing on ""Swamp"", the better. The first half of <em>Plunder</em> is marked by over-emoting, over-playing, and over-compensating.</p><p>
    It's a relief when they don't try so hard. On ""See It"", the waves of guitars never overcome the cool control of singer Dude Sir or the guiding hand of his melody. Same goes for ""Moses of the South"", with it's gently insistent rhythm scraped out from a muted acoustic, while the omnipresent glistening guitars merely color the song rather than take the focus. Later songs like ""Ageless Everytime"" and ""Shovel to Ground"" have soaring melodies and rhythms that unfold naturally, and ""What Will Come of Us"" has the open space that lets its bare, simple melody breathe-- but more than that, it's got the swagger that says they're convinced this simple melody will work. Colour Revolt prove here that they're a restless and ambitious band, which may very well lead towards more interesting material in the future, but they're still feeling themselves out and learning what works on  <em>Plunder, Beg, and Curse</em>.</p></div>"|11369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11369-plunder-beg-and-curse/|5.8|Jason Crock

Synths gradually overtake the piano and Gonzalez sings concise lyrics in falsetto-- ""It's your face/ Where are we?/ Save me""-- amid billowing harmonies. It's the sort of big, beatless slow-burn he often uses to dramatize an impending pivot, a moment when the percussion gallops in and the song takes off for the stratosphere. But on this track, ""You, Appearing"", that pivot never arrives. Instead, the music tapers off into the booming overture of ""Kim &amp; Jessie"".</p><p>
<em>Saturdays=Youth</em> is still huge music, with three players in addition to Gonzalez-- but it has a different kind of heft from previous M83 records. On <em>Before the Dawn Heals Us</em>, M83 was all about the vertical push-- layer after layer of synths and drums piled up in a vertiginous tower. But these new songs disperse in all directions: Producers Ewan Pearson and Ken Thomas spread the melodies and beats into a sound world of uncommon vibrancy and pristine clarity, mounted on a massive yet now more proportionate scale.</p><p>
    Not only does the music move differently, it offers a different take on M83's favorite decade, the 1980s. Where previous albums saluted the doomed grandeur of the Cure and the retro-futurism of <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Saturdays=Youth </em>pays homage to Cocteau Twins (whom Thomas has also produced) and the teen dramas of filmmaker John Hughes. It's dense with new wave tropes: the chrome-plated guitars and aqueous keyboards on ""Kim &amp; Jessie"", the decadent synthetic toms on the otherwise cloudy ""Skin of the Night"", the funk guitars and shivering cymbals of the masterful ""Couleurs"". Many modern bands have appropriated these iconic touchstones with a wink, a revision, or both. M83's reverent take is less common, bringing to mind Lansing-Dreiden's underappreciated 80s throwback <em>The Dividing Island</em>.
    </p><p>
    The album has the same nostalgic sparkle as Hughes' films, a soft-focused mythology of eternal summers and young love. In the liner notes, Gonzalez dedicates it to ""all the friends, music, movies, joints, and crazy teachers that made my teenage years so great!"" At 26, Gonzalez is just the right age to look back on this era with rose-tinted glasses, forgetting the alienation and anxiety, remembering only the sweetness. Whenever the darker side of teenhood rears its head, it's heroically
    battled back: On the shoegaze-thick ""Dark Moves of Love"", ""everything
    is wrecked and grey,"" but the song ends on a poignant note: ""I will
    fight the time and bring you back!"" On the album's cover, heartbreakingly radiant youths (one of them a
    dead ringer for Molly Ringwald) strike poses in a gold and russet
    pasture-- the same kind of beautiful misfits that Hughes arranged in
    after-school detention. In lyrics filled with lusty eruptions (""They
    are Gods! They are lightning!""), archetypal teens invent themselves
    with innocent fervor: A love-struck young couple in ""Kim &amp; Jessie"";
    a goth with a crown of black roses and a heart of bubblegum in
    ""Graveyard Girl"". 
    </p>
<p>
    In the context of teen drama, how perfect is it that Gonzalez met Morgan Kibby, whose dovelike vocals enrich ""Skin of the Night"" and ""Up!"", on MySpace? In the context of a band whose music is both literally and metaphorically cinematic, how perfect is it that Kibby has done voiceover work on the trailers for <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> and M. Night Shyamalan's <em>Lady in the Water</em>? These symmetries make <em>Saturdays=Youth </em>feel like an unaccountably alive, complete album. While some fans might be disappointed by the lack of a ""Don't Save Us From the Flames""-style anthem, the change in M83's sound arrives just as Gonzalez has pushed the maximal thing to its limits and risks diminishing returns. On its first two studio albums, M83 did one thing very, very well: create compact doses of tension and adrenaline. <em>Saturdays=Youth </em>meaningfully diversifies M83's catalog while retaining Gonzalez's indelible fingerprint. Like his recent ambient foray, <em>Digital Shades Vol. 1</em>, it finds a guy who's known for painting gigantic horizons figuring out how to broaden them even more.

    When Sweden's Sally Shapiro introduced herself in 2006 with near-perfect single ""I'll Be By Your Side"", she had no other discography, posed for no photographs except those taken by people she already knew, and gave no interviews. We knew her only by her bashful vocals and producer Johan Agebjörn's vintage Italo-disco production. Listeners could fill in the gaps of persona for themselves, unmediated by stylists, publicists, or the crumbling corporate edifices that have only lately wised up enough to start buying out your blogosphere. Like most great pop music, the song was able to make huge numbers of people each feel like it was just for us.</p><p>
    As great as Shapiro's full-length debut <em>Disco Romance</em> turned out to be, both in its original 2006 form and last year's souped-up U.S. release, I'll admit I was leery about the prospect of a remix album. Would <em>Remix Romance Vol. 1</em>, like so many remix compilations before it, be little more than an attempt to strike while the fire was hot? To cash in on Shapiro's recent internet renown without the hassle of bulking up her slim song catalog? I worried the idea would stretch way too thin the songs of an artist whose appeal lies at least partly in shy understatement.</p><p>
    Sometimes I think too much about things. <em>Remix Romance Vol. 1</em> is an accomplished, occasionally revelatory recasting of <em>Disco Romance</em>'s synth-pop by some of contemporary electronic music's most capable hands. The fragile melodies and melancholic lyrics of the original songs mostly survive the remixing process, but here they're dressed up in shiny disco (Toronto duo the Cansecos' ""Hold Me So Tight"", with its funky Gloria Gaynor bass lines), pulsating techno (Hamburg producer Tensnake's grand, Booka Shade-esque ""I'll Be By Your Side""), or even quirky keytar-and-cowbell electro-pop (Toronto duo Woodhands' ""Anorak Christmas""). The famously reticent Shapiro has finally come into the open in recent months, conducting a few interviews and appearing in public for a string of recent DJ gigs; <em>Remix Romance</em> is the sound of her coming-out party.
    </p>
<p>
    Even the most dramatically altered remixes here still keep enough of the source material's lonesome charm, just changing the scope from pop's concise three-minute single to dance music's vast 12""-ready sprawl. An 11-minute ""Time to Let Go"" by Norway's Lindstrøm holds up after hours of listening, transforming the title phrase to dancefloor mantra while fluid guitars, synths, and house beats percolate gradually into a cosmic disco epic; Shapiro could be reading the phone book as she whispers in French, but it still wouldn't diminish the hypnotic effect. DFA's the Juan MacLean gets a co-writing credit for his ""I Know You're My Love"", which combines shimmering, angelic choruses with the analogue synth arpeggios of the classic Italo that appeared on the influential <em>Mixed Up in the Hague</em> compilation. And the ever-dependable Canadians of Junior Boys transform U.S. <em>Disco Romance</em> bonus cut ""Jackie Jackie (Spend This Winter With Me)"" into pensive, shadowy ""Jackie Junior"", with squiggly horn and synth fragments playing out atop a rubbery sawtooth bass line.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Remix Romance Vol. 1</em> isn't always as breathtaking as those three tracks, but it's constantly uncovering new sides to Shapiro's songs. I've criticized Toronto instrumental rockers Holy Fuck's remix of Radiohead's ""Nude"" for adding little but drums and smeary textures to the original, but they flesh out ""Find My Soul"" with some metallic squeals and R.E.M.-esque minor-key acoustic guitar jangle, and their live drumming brings Shapiro from some fantasy 1980s European disco to the present day's beer-smelling but very real rock clubs. Norway's Skatebård nearly beats Agebjörn at his own game with the vocoders, snow-frosted synths, and whimsical whistles of ""He Keeps Me Alive""; Sweden's Between Interval re-imagines rain-drenched ""Sleep in My Arms"" as a serene, ambient space walk. Sure, absence makes the heart grow fonder, but <em>Remix Romance Vol. 1</em> reaffirms that Shapiro's music is the type you can live with day in and day out. You know, a lasting romance.

    In West Africa, the last name ""Diabaté"" is a bit like the surname ""Smith."" It's common, as it traditionally connotes an occupation, in this case a musical caste, with the holder part of a long line of singers and oral historians-- griots, or, among Mali's Manding people, Jali. Indeed, Toumani Diabaté comes from a long line of kora players. One cousin is the well-regarded Maya Sona Jobarteh. Another is Mamadou Diabaté. Diabaté's name and his skills allegedly span 70 generations. Yet the rising crossover popularity of Toumani Diabaté stems as much from the instrument he plays itself as it does from his mastery of it. The kora is a 21-string harp, of sorts, crafted out of a halved calabash gourd, cow skin and fishing line. Watching someone play it is not unlike watching someone weave, with the results as beautiful as an intricate tapestry.</p><p>
    It's a wonder the delicate sounds of the kora and Toumani Diabaté's playing weren't lost in his last project, a recording with his long-simmering Symmetric Orchestra. An African big band featuring Diabaté and over 50 other musicians, the Symmetric Orchestra is an overt attempt on Diabaté's part to modernize the traditional role of the griot in Mali. <em>The Mande Variations</em>-- only Diabaté's second solo record, and his first since 1988-- couldn't be more different. Here it's just Diabaté and his unadorned kora, recorded with maximum clarity as he pays tribute to his roots and peers.</p><p>
    Backing up a tad, it is truly remarkable that a musician as revered and respected as Diabaté has really only recorded a pair of solo records, with a 20-year gap in between. Obviously he's stayed busy, what with collaborations with everyone from Björk to his Malian peer Ali Farka Touré (honored on a new song named after him). It's a real testament to Diabaté's talent that an instrument as distinctive as the kora can be made to fit in such disparate surroundings, and indeed <em>The Mande Variations</em> works as a sort of crash course in the kora's versatility.
    </p>
<p>
    Even sans overdubs, the 10-minute ""Si naani"" hints at everything from jazz to chamber classical as Diabaté's lush polyrhythms and melodies overlap. ""Elyne Road"" (named after a street in London, and reportedly inspired by hearing UB40 on his first visit to England) begins as a beautiful ballad before evolving into something wholly more complex. The elaborate, improvised trills of ""Ali Farka Touré"" pay tribute to the style of the late guitarist (with whom Diabaté worked on 2005's <em>In the Heart of the Moon</em>).
    </p>
<p>
    ""Kaounding Cissoko"" could pass for the tricky ragas of John Fahey, with its drone undercurrent, while ""Djourou Kara Nany"" swings, however gently. Less successful is the explicit Ennio Morricone quote that starts ""Cantelowes""-- the familiar theme from <em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em>, no less-- but that very, very brief digression is the nearest <em>The Mande Variations</em> ever comes to pushing the listener out of Diabaté's world. No, this disc is the real thing, casually captivating from start to finish, with Diabaté's modesty and restraint keeping his virtuosity and the rigor of his compositions from calling conspicuous attention to themselves. It's haunting stuff, no doubt, not in the ""ooh, scary"" sense, but in the awe inspired by hearing music this pure woven from the hands of a man.

Nerds already out of high school will have to settle for Atom's heirs, and somehow, there are many. Dan Deacon, Matt &amp; Kim, and Team Robespierre have all made recent runs at the bleating sequencer, kiddie wail title-- which I guess people now actually want? Certainly it still has the same effect on grownups: Watch the way Studio B's bouncers pulverize the crowd every time Matt &amp; Kim storm through.</p><p>
    Come to think of it, the video for ""88th Precinct"" from <em>Everything's Perfect</em>, Team Robespierre's recent debut, begins inside the Nassau G Train stop, just a few blocks away from Studio B. Somebody in a lucha libre costume takes off down the platform, then snorts at the camera, and pretty soon all the kids are at a raging TR gig, and everybody knows all the lyrics. This, I guess, for all the people who didn't just listen to record and get the same idea-- practice at home, and then perform it live every night Team Robespierre happen to be in your town.</p><p>
    It's probably my bad ears that can't quite tell the Men's Recovery Project synth on ""Gasoline"" from the Thrones synth on ""88th Precinct"" from the Matt &amp; Kim synth on ""Ha Ha Ha"", but I get the concept. Like Atom, Team Robespierre are shooting for rite-of-passage status. The band lets kids excited about music be kids excited about music. As far as I can tell, the quartet has a bent for MRP-style surrealistic lyrics, although most of 'em seem to be not very political; the primary standard for what comes out of the dueling vocalists' mouths almost certainly comes down to what sounds best shouted out loud. Same thing with the wavy dueling synths, programmed to incite the crowd, down to the drum machine double bass.</p><p>
    So although <em>Everything's Perfect</em> may not be much for listening to in the ol' bedroom, the songs are actually sorta great-- forgettable blasts of energy'n'enervation. Now that even the most modest of bands can reasonably expect an audience in the millions for even their most throwaway practice sessions, it's great to hear TR make something strictly for the 150 kids they see every Friday night.<br/></p></div>"|11389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11389-everythings-perfect/|6.4|Zach Baron

However, the most prominent indie rock artists to have sprung from the region in the past decade have been defined by a notable lack of fun, fun, fun, from the macro, modern-world meditations of Grandaddy to the fraught, tender intimacies of Death Cab for Cutie. Situated between these two totems-- both geographically and spiritually-- are L.A.'s Division Day, who are seemingly so in tune with west-coast despondency that they named themselves after an Elliott Smith song.</p><p>
    But Division Day are rarely shy about their diffidence-- their debut full-length, <em>Beartrap Island</em>, communicates its overarching sense of melancholy with assertive, sometimes aggressive gestures. The album has been gestating since 2005, and though one can't assume the tracklist reflects the songwriting's chronology, <em>Beartrap Island</em> plays like a spirited juxtaposition of ideas before tempering itself into a more refined, if less captivating, presentation. In its opening stretch, the album touches on wondrous, synth-swathed psychedelic reveries (the 80-second title track), scrappy, staccato rock rave-ups (""Ricky"") and, in their most successful turn, a reconciliation of the two on ""Catch Your Death"", which locks into a swirling, stuttering drum beat (suggesting a nascent dub influence) before double-timing into an effectively urgent chorus.</p><p>
    But with the onset of ""Hurricane"", Division Day's agenda comes into sharper focus: plaintive, pulse-regulating adult-contemporary indie rock that's often afflicted with a bout of mid-tempo-itis. Perhaps sensing that his bald sentiments (to wit: ""I want your blood inside my head"") could set off the emo alarm, singer Rohner Segnitz maintains a poised, breathy delivery that keeps the melodrama and histrionics to a minimum, but at the same time seems overly subservient to the songs' lazy haze; by the time we hit the second-act power ballad ""Reversible"", the portentous synth tones and Edge-y guitars render Division Day indistinguishable from any number of contemporary modern-rock bands striving for 1980s Big Music import.</p><p>
    So it's no small consolation that <em>Beartrap Island</em>'s most serious song topic is given an affectingly spare presentation that allows Segnitz's voice to stand on its own humble terms, without attempting to obscure or bolster it. The song is called ""Dayenu"", a reference to a Passover hymn commemorating the Exodus tale, wherein the title (which translates to ""it would suffice us"") is traditionally sung with joyous gusto. But in Division Day's case, the song's theme-- essentially, one of just being lucky to be alive-- is appropriated for a downcast rumination on surviving a near-fatal fever, illuminated by trolling organ accompaniment and sparks of feedback. Perhaps it's not the most appropriate selection for the Seder table this weekend, but in their own modest way, Division Day turn their own sorrow into something worth celebrating.</p></div>"|11402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11402-beartrap-island/|6.1|Stuart Berman

With the help     of like-minded Baltimore tinkerers, the duo frequently expands into     Microkingdom's Pro Hour, improvising over Redman's pattern-shifting pieces. Pro     Hour's debut, <i>Wrenches: My Heart/Double Abacus</i>,     employees Baltimore improvisational mainstay John Dierker on saxophone and     clarinet. In 20 swift minutes (unfortunately available only through a     self-release of 300 aquamarine LPs), the trio capitalizes on Redman's tense     writing and drumming, Miller's caustic guitar proclivities, and Dierker's     improvisational fire. <i>Wrenches: My Heart/Double Abacus</i> is dynamic,     challenging, confident, and preternaturally developed for such a humble     beginning, the work of musicians questioning each other's habits so as to bend     good ideas into great sounds. Count it: It's hard to imagine having more fun     with some drums, a guitar, and some reeds.</p>
<p>The compositional smarts are immediately apparent but just as quickly     dismissed: All three musicians leap headlong into ""Double Abacus"",     attacking a groove and mutating it. Redman, Dierker, and Miller shift a     relatively simple time signature as though they're mapping Tony Williams' drumkit--which     warped rhythms as a force of habit-- to an instrumental trio. The saxophone     leans forward, the guitar pulls backward, and the drums kick in the middle,     looking for stability until it's apparent there will be none. Things appear to     fall apart, all three instruments squiggling in celebration of liberation. But     the rhythm presides even as everyone darts around it. As each musician moves     back toward the middle, the piece collapses into silence. The saxophone again     blasts its staccato theme, but the guitar and drums plow forward now,     sideswiping order with chaos. The horn reciprocates, slinking with flagrant     squawks and piercing sharp notes. The remaining five minutes are a set of duo     and trio battles. You'll need to pick a team.</p>
<p>Similarly, ""Wrenches: My Heart"" makes the expected feel unexpected     by working through two distinct parts. Each half shocks itself and its listener     with sudden jolts of tightly wound motion. You see them coming from a minute or     so out, developing into perfectly sculpted tension. Nevertheless, when they     happen, they're still exhilarating, railroading the given shape with outsider     confidence: An electronic hum opens, an invitation to something eerie. Flints     of guitar noise, circular sighs of a saxophone, and percussive layers teetering     above silence accept. When they flash out, you'll jump: Drums, sax and guitar     jerk into tight time and steadily peel from the center in wild Z-shapes. The     sax heaves ahead, but the drums jack behind in a loosely syncopated groove. The     guitar skips between both paths, sliding into the beat before slashing right     past it.</p>
<p>Again, there's silence. The hum cedes to another flash-shorter this time,     with less rhythmic lockstep. The pieces peel apart. Dierker's saxophone deals     in long, slow sighs countered by quick flirtations with melody. Miller's guitar     bypasses notes for textures. Schizophrenia defines both the unit and the     individual. Even Redman can't stand himself. He's heavy and lumbering with the     kick drum but light, teasing, almost playful with the cymbal and snare.     Everything drifts outward until Redman pulls back toward the middle, offering a     rhythm with rests big enough for the guitar and the saxophone. But Miller and     Dierker just circle the gaps, cutting between and around them as the rests get     smaller and tighter. Tension builds. Another flash? Nope. Silence. Then, a     voice: ""It fucking wrenches my heart, man."" A fitting motto for such     a breathless debut.</p></div>"|11664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11664-wrenches-my-heartdouble-abacus/|7.8|Grayson Currin

    For better or worse, Cut Copy swim in the same pool as those electro, French touch, and new wave revivalists for whom fashion, irony, and self-consciousness represent swords to live and die by. In a scene as self-reflexive as this, backlashes are the order of the day, but even still, there are signs-- such as the increasing use of ""blog house"" as an eye-rolling pejorative, recent records by Calvin Harris, Does It Offend You Yeah?, and Ghostland Observatory, and the parallel rise of Balearic-feeling dance as a worthy substitute-- that this world might be slipping under the weight of its own ubiquity. Based on their patchy and rainbow-chasing 2004 debut, <em>Bright Like Neon Love</em> there was every reason to believe that a new Cut Copy record this late in the cycle would only accelerate the meltdown; after all, there are only so many ways to arrange and re-arrange vibrant art direction, moneyed aloofness, and the right kinds of sounds before the party heads to a new venue altogether.</p><p>
    As it turns out, we needn't have been so cynical-- not when Cut Copy aren't. If the pastichey <em>Bright Like Neon Love</em> felt more like an opportunistic patchwork quilt of other people's sounds and ideas, the hugely enjoyable <em>In Ghost Colours</em> feels light, confident, and unencumbered by the dictates of fashion. More than anything, though, it's a gloriously positive record, one whose cheerily strummed acoustic guitars, shimmering synths, sweeping choruses, and playful sonics maintain a delicate balance; where a lot of summer pop records like this often scream fun to the point of being oppressive (or at least annoyingly instructive), there's nothing remotely show-offy about <em>In Ghost Colours</em>. In fact, it's closer in spirit to the Avalanches' <em>Since I Left You</em> than it is to anything from the past few years. It's a hard record not to love.</p><p>
<em>In Ghost Colours</em> was co-produced by DFA's Tim Goldsworthy, who deserves credit for simultaneously opening up the band's palette while relaxing their delivery. Sure, as you might expect, there are still blushes of French house and electro scattered liberally all over the show, but they're always deployed in ways that serve-- rather than overshadow-- the song. And while Cut Copy's principle and founding member Dan Whitford may come from a DJ background, the band-led songs come across every bit as muscular and as noteworthy as the dancefloor crossovers. To that end, this is one of the best bridges between electro and rock in a long time; the joins are so seamless that you don't even think of the songs on those terms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    From the first swirling synths and gleaming melodies of curtain raiser ""Feel the Love"", <em>In Ghost Colours</em> asserts itself as a hugely magnanimous record. Everything here sounds stadium-sized, loved-up, and breezily inclusive. There's the lead single ""Lights &amp; Music"", an arena rock slow burner with a disco chorus; or the superb, helicoptering house of 2007 single ""Hearts on Fire"", which gets a welcome reprise; or the sunburst rock of ""Unforgettable Season"", which recalls Broken Social Scene in its ability to sound in full swoon from chord one; or the carefree ""Strangers in the Wind"", whose lazy verse and torpid guitar peels owe a little bit to Fleetwood Mac.  Elsewhere, ""So Haunted"" and ""Far Away"" compete for standout track status, the former sandwiching verses of fuzzy guitar squall around one of the most gorgeous-sounding choruses of the year, the latter an effervescent bit of 80s synth fluff that holds up against the best of Human League and Erasure.
    </p>
<p>
    So yeah, you get the point: Pop lovers will find lots to love here, and if there's any justice, this record will keep them swooning through the summer. Regardless of what kind of audience it ultimately finds, though, <em>In Ghost Colours</em> earns its smiles with a combination of ingenuity and easiness that you don't often come by, and for that, even in April, it already feels like a triumph.<br/>

    On the surface, Scottish trio Frightened Rabbit are like a lot of other bands. You could file them away with other musicians from their Glasgow scene, or other bassist-free groups, or other bands of literal brothers (frontman Scott and drummer Grant Hutchison are siblings). But somehow, despite the fact that their methods are well-worn, their product is one-of-a-kind, as their consistently great second album (in under a year, no less!) attests.</p><p>
    The key here is Scott's urgent-yet-emotive songwriting. <em>Midnight Organ Flight</em> is full of rousing barnburners that flicker with soul, ballads that ache with masculine vulnerability, and Frightened Rabbit's best song yet, opener ""The Modern Leper"". Built on insistently downstroked guitars and drums that build from a gallop to a thundering crash, this Pixies-go-acoustic track swells with self-loathing. ""Is that you in front of me/ Coming back for even more of exactly the same?/ You must be a masochist/ To love a modern leper on his last leg,"" sings Scott, and rarely has a song with such anthemic, air-drum-worthy fills been shot through with so much personal revulsion.</p><p>
    Grant's muscular drumming is a highlight throughout the record-- and on stage. At a recent New York show, the band hadn't yet made it through two songs before he'd splintered three drumsticks with his powerful pounding. With the absence of another instrument to hold down the rhythm section (guitarist Billy Kennedy does occasionally fill out the low end with keyboard), he uses his percussion-- the satisfying hiss of his cymbals, the breathless insistence of his thudding kick drum, the delicious sizzle of his marching-band snare-- to saturate the empty space in the compositions. Flailing about at his kit, he keeps time wildly yet melodically, controlled amidst the chaos. 
    </p>
<p>
    Despite the trio's static (and relatively spare) set-up, Scott's songs imbue the band with an elastic identity. Scuzzed up tracks like ""Fast Blood"" and almost-bluegrass weepers like ""Good Arms Vs. Bad Arms"" prove that Frightened Rabbit have stretched beyond the melancholic folk-pop of <em>Sing the Greys</em>. But elsewhere-- most notably ""My Backwards Walk"" and ""Old Old Fashioned""-- they re-confirm their dedication to the sound they perfected on their debut, playing electronic and acoustic guitars against each other for stomping mid-tempo gems that pulse with nervous energy and heart-on-sleeve lyrics. 
    </p>
<p>
    Though nothing else on the album hits the pop high of its opener-- ""Leper"" is a tough act to follow-- its I'm-not-worthy sentiments are prevalent on all the album's best tracks. On ""The Twist"", a desperate yet tender ballad built on a similar freight-train piano line as LCD Soundsystem's ""All My Friends"", the protagonist practically begs for sex-- ""I can be who you like,"" he pleads-- while sadly allowing himself to be used. ""Whisper the wrong name,"" sings Scott in his accented bagpipe drone of a voice, ""I don't care and nor do my ears."" In track after track, Scott expresses that need for the warmth of another, however unworthy he may feel of it.
    </p>
<p>
    Those sentiments are also echoed in ""Keep Yourself Warm"": ""You won't find love in a hole/ It takes more than fucking someone to keep yourself warm."" He's wallowing, but Scott's cracked voice sells every word, and his band's rousing rhythms and rough-hewn guitar interplay keep the mood from ever getting lugubrious or maudlin. Sure, Frightened Rabbit aren't the first band to explore loneliness, horniness, or emptiness in song, just like they aren't the first set of siblings to decide to jam together, but their jangly melodies claw their way inside your brain just the same, making them latest in a long line of Glasgow bands to effortlessly combine celebratory sonics and miserablist lyrics into something singular.

    When you're essentially partners in crime with a band of bad boys like the Black Lips, it takes extra effort not to appear tame by comparison. The Selmanaires have grown up in the burgeoning Atlanta indie scene nearly step-for-step with the Lips, but while both bands brandish a renegade, devil-may-care ethos, they each come at it from very different angles. Playing the ego to the Lips' id, the Selmanaires show off a (slightly) more civilized musicianship, exploring several decades worth of genres versus hedonistically ripping through three-minute Stones and Motown throwbacks.</p><p>
    That's not to say <em>The Air Salesmen</em> doesn't also go down well with a lukewarm can of Milwaukee's Best. On this sophomore effort, the band offers plenty of opportunities for debauchery, though they're cribbed in a more nuanced tone. On one hand, you have a heedless lothario anthem like ""Just to Get Yr Love"", its skyscraping guitar wails and cocksure come-ons a friendly parody of chic retro bands like Wolfmother or the Darkness. That frat-friendly attitude gets turned on its head, however, by the sultry yet cautionary ""Nite Beat"", a dance-rock song steeped in Franz Ferdinand-style soap opera sex and violence: ""Get on the floor/ There's no time to implore.../ We lay down our instincts.""</p><p>
    The middle third of <em>Salesmen</em> stands as the album's most brow-raising section. Here the band flexes some unexpected intellectual muscle to tackle bookish post-punk in the tradition of Talking Heads, Gang of Four, and Throbbing Gristle. It's a Rubik's Cube the band doesn't quite crack, but there's still plenty of existential charm in the Go4 offshoot ""Reason and Chance"", whether in its pleasureless metallic drone or observations on human rationality and determinism. It's no secret ""A Small Room"" and ""GMAFB"" (short for ""Give me a fucking break"") strive to emulate David Byrne's televangelist bark and his band's intricate rhythms, even if the crass demeanor and ham-handed songwriting more closely resemble late-1980s Red Hot Chili Peppers.
    </p>
<p>
    While this jerky genre-hopping helps to hold the listener's attention, some dabbling passes by too quickly. The catchy ""Verdigris Intrigue"", for example, is a lone psychedelic daydream amongst rawkers and post-punk reincarnations, a sad fact considering it's the strongest four and a half minutes here. Still, <em>Salesman</em> makes a stronger case for these guys as serious musicians than their clumsier debut, and their enthusiasm, for whichever genre they're copping, remains irrefutable. Even when borrowing from a library of ideas, though, exceptional bands find a way to make it all sound exclusively their own, and that skill remains the Selmanaires's biggest hurdle to date.

Would that be a genre in its own right, or a coalition of separate styles which mix at artists' own risk? The practical grapplers with this issue have tended to be DJs, but in Britain especially there's a tradition of prominent acts who've opted for a ""big-tent"" approach to music-making, cleaving to no particular subgenre and crafting albums which roam freely through clubland and beyond in search of anything that might catch a few ears. 808 State used to do it well, Leftfield proved there was a big market for it, and Basement Jaxx pushed it to a delirious artistic peak.</p><p>
    And Groove Armada? They prove the perils of the big-tent approach. <em>Soundboy Rock</em> is the fifth eclectic album in the duo's eclectic ten-year career, during which they've sold plenty of (highly eclectic) records and the sum total of their pop culture impact has been a car advert about waggling bottoms. And most of the people who rightly hate ""I See You Baby (Shakin That Ass)"" wouldn't even know it was by them.</p><p>
    Thankfully, <em>Soundboy Rock</em> offers two mighty shots at redemption. Messy first single ""Get Down"" is carried by the bubble-and-squeak energy of long-lost grime MC Lady Stush: it's so good to hear her squeal and cackle again that you don't really worry where the hook is. Besides, the glorious follow-up, ""Song 4 Mutya (Out Of Control)"", has all the hook you'll need-- an eighties pop fantasia where New Order collaborate with Prince to soundtrack Mutya Buena's ex-directed anger.</p><p>
    ""Song 4 Mutya"" is inspired, but the rest of <em>Soundboy Rock</em> gives a truer picture of Groove Armada's talents and limitations. Nothing here irritates or even displeases, but almost every track is a stylistic workout missing the killer idea that would make it vital. Candi Staton turns up for a Chicago house tribute, ""Love Sweet Sound"", which gets the style's spacey noises right but not its sensual or spiritual desperation. On the other hand, The Rakes' Alan Donohue MCing about polar bears dying on the indie-dub ""See What You Get"" is a lot less awful than that summary suggests: almost everything on this album tends gently towards the middle.</p><p>
    The group seem happiest here when they're pastiching their own former triumphs. ""From the Rooftops"" and ""Paris"" revisit the group's chill-out roots (and the roots of <em>Chill Out</em>-- both tracks borrow samples from the KLF's seminal album), swaddling pretty melodies in echo to create a genuinely comfortable comfort zone. ""Lightsonic"" is a cousin of former hit ""Superstylin'"", and the combination of balearic keyboards, big beat and cornball toasting is as stupidly uplifting this time as last.</p><p>
    Groove Armada have touted <em>Soundboy Rock</em> as their best album, and they're probably right, because they've excised the smarmy or irritating elements of their earlier work. The record was inspired by the atmosphere of Lovebox, the London festival they curate and DJ at, and it certainly proves that they know what great dance music sounds like: it also suggests they lack the spark to consistently make it themselves.</p></div>"|11300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11300-soundboy-rock/|5.8|Tom Ewing

    Few songwriters could bear the scrutiny of a book of lyrics,
    although far too many invite it. Writing good songs is only half the challenge;
    the other is to set words compellingly to paper, without the securities of
    voice, chords, and melody to reinforce their internal rhythms and recast their
    meanings. In 2002, Mark Kozelek, formerly of Red House Painters and currently
    alternating between a solo project and the loosely defined Sun Kil Moon (which
    is pretty much a solo project), released a book of lyrics called <em>Nights of Passed Over</em> in Europe, where
    his cult is even more intensely rabid than his American audience. Culling
    primarily from his work with Red House Painters, the book argued persuasively
    for Kozelek as a gifted, intuitive, and insightful songwriter, with
    an aversion to sentimentality and a way of combining words that is evocative
    without being showy or clever. His lyrics can stand on their own, even without
    his low, rich, sad voice and shimmering, patient guitar.</p><p>
    Six years later, Kozelek has reissued <em>Nights of Passed Over</em> in America.
    A lot has happened during that interim: He has released three albums as Sun Kil
    Moon and has already reissued one of them, has put out a live album under his
    own name, and has formed his own record label, Caldo Verde. The label is also
    publishing this new version of <em>Nights of
    Passed Over,</em> which is accompanied by <em>Nights</em>,
    a full disc of alternate takes, rarities, and live tracks. It might seem like
    an act of supreme hubris if it weren't for the fact the Kozelek often eludes
    musical associations in favor of literary ones. Despite the persistent
    comparisons to Neil Young and Crazy Horse at their most compact, his literary
    influences seem much more useful: Kozelek draws from Raymond Carver when he's
    in storyteller mode, at other times from Robert Lowell or Norman Dubie or James
    Kavanaugh. That's a big statement for any musician, especially one who tends to
    write about his cats.</p><p>
<em>Nights</em> begins with
    a live version of ""Michigan"",
    from the Painters' 2001 swan song <em>Old
    Ramon</em>. The song thrums with a palpable sense of desire and a quickly
    diminishing sense of restraint: ""I see through your
    thin cotton dress/ I don't know if we'll
    get to rest/ So pull by that store
    parking lot/ You know I've missed
    you lots/ Warn me of the cans
    and nots."" Recorded at Union Chapel in London,
    this version of ""Michigan"" features
    only Kozelek's vocals, which are subtle as an internal monologue, accompanied
    by his acoustic guitar and a rapt audience. That's really all it needs. In a
    sly stroke of sequencing, he moves directly into ""Drop"", from the same venue, with
    its devastating admission delivered in long lines that seem to break the meter:
    ""All the love in an instant makes my life stop/ But then my hate for you makes
    my feelings altogether drop."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, Kozelek isn't a literary figure, but a musical
    one, so the CD lives and dies by the sounds that accompany his words. And these
    are, by Kozelek's own admission, the lesser takes, so occasionally <em>Nights</em> does little more than remind you
    to pull out your old copy of <em>Ocean</em><em> </em><em>Beach</em>. The
    guitars on this ""Jam version"" of ""Carry Me Ohio"" ground out the melody like a
    cigarette into asphalt, but the nice, twisty solo somewhat redeems this take. Originally
    released on Cameron Crowe's Vinyl Films label, this acoustic version of ""Duk
    Koo Kim"", from Sun Kil Moon's <em>Ghosts of
    Great Highway</em>, sounds hypnotic as the guitars pick out a steady theme that
    changes notes even as they repeat the same rhythm. For all its ups and downs, <em>Nights</em> never feels like a vault-emptying
    exercise. It's more a compendium of Kozelek's marginalia.
    </p>
<p>
    Kozelek has updated <em>Nights
    of Passed Over</em> up through <em>April</em>,
    his long-awaited Sun Kil Moon follow-up to <em>Ghosts
    of Great Highway</em> (not counting the Modest Mouse covers album <em>Tiny Cities). </em>The simultaneous release of both works makes <em>Nights
    of Passed Over</em> seem like one of the most elaborate lyrics sheet ever. These new
    songs continue his emphasis on steadily paced compositions about lost loves,
    distant friends, deep regrets, and nebulous sadness, but shifts the setting
    from the open road to closed-in rooms at the end of long drives. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not as immediately accessible as <em>Ghosts, April</em> starts with ""Lost Verses"" and ""The Light"", two long,
    slow songs that are together nearly twenty minutes long. This is Kozelek time,
    and it takes a moment to adjust. But once you do, the nuances of the songs'
    melodies and arrangements gradually announce themselves, like lengthy jam
    tacked onto ""Lost Verses"" and the grinding electric strums that fill the spaces
    between the vocals on ""The Light"". Lyrically more than musically, ""Lost Verses""
    makes for an effective opener, as Kozelek seems to consider all the things that
    he has neglected to write down: ""Lost verses well up my eyes and ears,"" he
    sings plaintively, fearing that he'll become a lost verse to the people he
    loves. That sense of faltering memory colors <em>April</em> in shades of rainy grays and deep blues. It's a spring album
    that still pines for previous seasons.
    </p>
<p>
    By the time the moody, acoustic ""Lucky Man"" comes around,
    the album has set its stride and maintains it through eight more songs. Bonnie
    Prince Billy lends backing vocals on the country-tinged ""Like the River and ""Unlit
    Hallway"", which breaks for a spiky banjo solo. These are the most dramatic
    departures on April, which expands only minimally on the solemn Americana of
    Kozelek's previous works. He hits many familiar notes, yet manages to make it
    all sound new and even adventurous instead of conservative or quaint. He
    reaches into his fragile upper register on ""Harper
    Road"", and maps out a travelogue on ""Moorestown""
    that feels nearly threadbare with remembering. ""Tonight the Sky"" draws out its
    meanings with churning guitars, pausing for a lengthy solo that threatens to
    fall apart with every note. The album draws its power not simply from the
    quality of Kozelek's songwriting, but from the close intertwining of words and music,
    which makes his albums much more essential than any book he could ever publish.
