    and the other accoutrements that with their lo-fi lack of polish made the group sound genuinely ""vintage""-- in the most leftover, castaway sense of the word.  It took a real spark of ingenuity to 
    breathe life into something that had been all but designed to sound beaten: the snarled noise of <i>Gash</i> and the infectious, bubbly <i>Museum of Imaginary Animals</i>-- with its 
    mermaids and owls, frizzy noise and bursting-out hooks-- showcase the band at their best.</p><p>
    
    But their new record, <i>Dark Island</i>, paints them in a drab light.  Working at a slower pace, they play off a shallow exoticism as genuine as a fortune teller on the boardwalk in a seaside town.  
    Song titles like ""Penny Arcade"" and ""Peepshow"" evoke old-time fun, the kind that you don't really believe in but go along with because it's shiny and makes your date giggle.  But more often 
    than not, the facade doesn't sparkle: the album's like a wind-up toy that's slowly worn itself out.</p><p>
    
    The problem is that Pram don't fit the poignant mood they're trying to create.  First and foremost, singer Rosie Cuckston-- their lyricist and frontwoman-- sounds dreary even as 
    she aims for ""mysterious.""  To further the analogy, if we're talking about wind-up toys, Cuckston is the clapping monkey that's been loved a little too hard and can't quite get the 
    cymbals to connect.  Her voice has often been called ""idiosyncratic"" for her tendency to show off just how <i>weak</i> it can be; instead of playing to its few strengths, she'll flaunt how 
    much she's struggling to hit or sustain a note-- see <i>Museum</i>'s ""Bewitched"" for an example that, in a goofy way, actually works.   Here, however, she's just flattened and even 
    listless on ballads like ""Goodbye""-- a tune with a glimmering melody and hurt sentiment that nevertheless doesn't tug the heartstrings.  </p><p>
    
    The band barely shakes off the dust of the past three years: trumpet and clarinet on ""Peepshow"" barely conjure a burlesque swagger, but the synths of ""Penny Arcade""-- the kind of 
    technology that gets them compared to a low-rent Stereolab-- throb and buzz dazingly to support Cuckston's hints of sin.  ""Paper Hats"", with an abruptly quicker tempo and knottier lyrics, 
    almost sounds out of place, less breezy and more tense than the other tracks.  The instrumentals promise less and deliver the most, like ""Leeward"", which captures the best sense of 
    dreamy, distant drifting, wafting away on numbing waters; yet too many of the songs repeat and meander until this mood wears off.</p><p>
    
    With more work, this direction could pay off, but even the fizziest of their past records were marked by eccentric, even manic bursts that carried the dark subject matter; at their best, they refined 
    the contrast between the tinny gaiety of their tacky music and the complexity of Cuckston's voice.  Taking the whole thing seriously ruins the tension, and <i>Dark Islands</i> is as somber as 
    an amusement park in the off-season: sad and profound-looking at first, but ultimately, pretty dull.</p></div>"|6446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6446-dark-island/|5.7|Chris Dahlen

    conversation unless you have John Cleese's accent.  The modern definition is simple enough: ""n; a diminutive human,"" according to the American Heritage dictionary.  But there's a 
    second, archaic definition that I prefer: ""n; a miniature, fully formed individual believed by adherents of the early biological theory of preformation to be present in the sperm cell.""</p><p>
    There's just something about the image in the second definition I find hilarious.  Like, here's this little guy, piloting a sperm toward an egg, and when he gets there, he just starts expanding, 
    like those dinosaur sponge things you got at the museum store when you were a kid.  The theory is so obviously bogus on so many surface levels it's staggering.  Who in any medical capacity 
    in any era could seriously have looked at a baby and not noticed how different the physical proportions were from an adult?  It's just absurd.</p><p>
    This, of course, makes the name just about perfect for a band like Homunculus, who use absurdity and wit as their lyrical bread and butter.  In fact, the wit of the writing can get a bit grating 
    over the course of a full album, but taken individually, each of the ten songs on <i>Words</i>, this quintet's debut-- there are four of them on the album cover, but they're a quintet-- works pretty 
    well.  Actually, come to think of it, there's one exception, but we'll get to that in a minute.</p><p>
    First, the things they do correctly.  If there's one undeniable strength these five guys possess, it's the gift of melody.  They whip out one ear-clobbering hook after another, going 
    ten for ten with a couple extra-base hits for good measure.  This is critical for a band whose musical formula is pretty conventional-- verses, choruses, the occasional 
    bridge, and fairly steady instrumentation-- so every song here has to hold up its end or things get boring really fast. </p><p>
    ""Here and There"" establishes the sound right away: Ben Doepke's prominent piano licks pass the chords while drums and auxiliary percussion serve up a bouncing 
    rhythm and double tracked vocals spread melody into every available nook.  The spins on this formula range from the Caribbean cocktail piano that dominates ""Deep South Beach"" to the 
    smokier R&amp;B; of ""Time in a Can"", which owes a lot of its success to Adam Schoex92s melodic bass line and the band's close harmonies.  ""Walking Home"" supports detailed lyrics about losing 
    out on a bus ride for lack of sufficient pocket change with a bass and percussion pattern that actually approaches fusion, cut through with weird, echoing synthesizer.</p><p>
    The best song on hand, though, is ""When Sheila Dances"", which marks a huge step forward lyrically with its surrealist imagery and vivid description.  ""When Sheila Dances she lights on 
    fire/ And through the laughter she melts like butter,"" ""The world is merely a book of matches/ He wants her spirit/ He wants her ashes.""  The song's smoothly delivered minor key melody is 
    entrancing, and easily the album's highlight.  On the other end of the spectrum, though, is ""Stargazing"", which opens with the non-sequitur ""Stargazing from the bathroom/ Naked astronaut,"" 
    and continues with what seems like an unsuccessful attempt to break down the effects of weightlessness on love and some other stuff that I'm not really clear on.</p><p>
    What it all adds up to is a semi-solid debut spiked with a bit a bit of potential.  The album's production has a sort of neutering smoothness to it, which will likely put off a good many 
    prospective fans (and dropped this rating a bit as well), but the composition and performance really cax92t be denied.  At the very least, Homunculus are pretty well formed at this nascent stage, 
    and could develop into a pretty formidable band very quickly.</p></div>"|3913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3913-words/|6.4|Joe Tangari

    depravity.  Which is to say Shub Niggurath formed in the mid-80s in France, playing an engaging mixture of free-jazz, electroacoustic music and 
    avant-prog.  Thing is, it's pretty easy to forget this band was made of living, breathing people rather than a concoction brewed by some dark magus, 
    obsessed with violent self-gratification and the color black.  What's more, the band was named after a fertility demon created by master of the 
    macabre/really strange horror, H.P. Lovecraft.  ""Ia! Ia!"" was the Lovecraftian monster's cry, and it matches pretty well with the scratches, 
    shrieks and subsonic bass growl of Shub Niggurath.</p><p>
    1986's <i>Les Morts Vont Vite</i> was their first full-length release (after a self-released cassette), and so says me: it is one of the finest releases of 
    that decade.  The tunes tended to stretch out to epic length, and the atmosphere was decidedly grotesque: flailing, dirge-like beats, moaning, 
    atonal guitar solos and massively distorted bass painted a frightening picture filled with various indecencies, and one that but for Ann Stewart's 
    wordless soprano leads, would be almost entirely devoid of light.  The band's 1991 follow-up <i>C'etaient de Tres Grands Vents</i> went even further, 
    removing any ties to rock and presenting their dark visions as full-on impressionistic overtures and group improvisations.  Bassist Alain Ballaud 
    died of cancer in 1995, and the band broke apart, but their recordings from 1992 until that time are now available on this self-titled release.</p><p>
    The music here is generally of two varieties: dark and ugly.  That said, it is a deep darkness, and an interesting ugliness, so if it at first you dox92t 
    get a little queasy, try, try again.  For the most part, group improvisation is the program, and the overall mix of sounds shouldx92t actually be terribly 
    shocking for anyone used to freak-outs via the likes of Sonny Sharrock, Nurse With Wound or even early Sonic Youth.  The difference lies in Shub 
    Niggurath's way of making all their pieces (each of which is untitled, identified merely by its track length) seem less like meandering skronk than 
    soundtracks for bondage films we werex92t meant to see.  If you've heard records like Naked City's <i>Heretic</i> or Merzbow's <i>1930</i>-- records that wrung 
    seductive fear out of ""noise""-- you'll find something to grab hold of here.</p><p>
    My favorite track is actually the first, and, perhaps not coincidentally, it's the most structured.  It's also the most cinematically horrific, the perfect soundtrack for 
    plunging into darkness just after death.  Omnipresent yet distant bass drones engulf a mix that also features scraped metallic percussion, low rolling toms, 
    squealing guitar harmonics and a fine sonic approximation of the deep black sea.  I've heard this pallet of sounds before, but always obscured by other 
    elements and resolved too soon.  Shub Niggurath milk this for all of its potency, and if it's a very bad trip you're looking for, they have you covered.  
    The second track erases that uneasy tranquility with jagged jabs of guitar and tiger-roar bass, not to mention muscular jazz drums cracking anything in sight.  
    It almost seems like a three-way fistfight, as cuts and scars are traded among the participants in rapid succession.  If you can make through the gauntlet, I'd 
    say you're threshold for pain is pretty high.</p><p>
    Only the fifth track has anything close to a ""beat""-- fractured and thudding as it is-- but it doesx92t really takeoff until the last couple of minutes, wherein the aggressive 
    bass and guitar give way to precisely timed staccato hits.  The piece dies away into silence, and leads directly into the next, featuring what sounds like the remains of barbed 
    wire fence being shaken and Jean-Luc Herve's ornery, high-pitched six-string static.  It eventually climaxes into a hectic drone thrash (which doesx92t quite bury the odd screaming 
    in the background), not unlike something that might happen at the end of a particularly bleak Godspeed You! Black Emperor song.</p><p>
    I guess the only thing keeping me from really flipping over this CD is the way it all melds together in my head after I'm done listening.  Unlike 
    their debut, Shub Niggurath's final recordings went for an admirably dense method of madness as opposed to something more varied; still, their 
    persistence and talent for molding a small array of timbres into almost symphonic mass is impressive.  I wish they'd been able to continue, because 
    at the very least, this CD is a testament to a band who were quite obviously not done experimenting.  Go for <i>Les Morts Vont Vite</i> first, but know there's 
    something to unearth here too.</p></div>"|7706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7706-shub-niggurath/|7.7|Dominique Leone

    you by Clearcut Channel and like-unminded businessmen.  Tom Scharpling deejays ""The Best Show On WFMU,"" WFMU being the legendary and amazingly multiform New York/New Jersey 
    station on which programs as interesting as that of outsider-musicologist Irwin Chusid air. Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster telephones Scharpling's show, in different irritating guises, and 
    people initially were fooled into calling and joining the discussion; 1997's single-show <i>Rock, Rot &amp; Rule</i> captures this era. By the one 2000 show and five 2001 shows compiled on the
    two-disc <i>Chain Fights, Beer Busts, and Service With A Grin</i>, most of the audience is savvy to the show's premise, but they still call in as ironic participants. Yes, this prank has been 
    done to death by practitioners of wildly varying merit, but I've heard no one as witty, as satirical, or as gleefully self-aware as this duo.</p><p>
<i>Rock, Rot &amp; Rule</i> is a faux promotional interview with ""Ronald Thomas Clontle,"" who has ""written"" a book that's just a list dividing all of popular music history into the categories ""rock,"" ""rot,"" 
    and ""rule."" This concept is an apt spoof of the false authority of rock guidebooks, of how all music-critics are self-appointed assbags, and of the fraudulent ""expertise"" (regarding not just music, 
    but romance, parenting, etc.) holding forth from every magazine counter and bookstore shelf. Clontle admits to not being very knowledgeable, and has based his book on conversations he had 
    in a coffee shop in Lawrence, Kansas, and while visiting his grandmother in Gainesville, Florida. Clontle is disinterested (he has money on a basketball game in progress), his rationale is 
    inconsistent, and he contradicts himself often, setting up the enraged callers to come across as righteous defenders (and provincialist snobs, when they malign Lawrence and Gainesville).</p><p>
    While the stereotypical music fanatic can be a flinchy aesthete (one of the callers seems to find Clontle's taste indicted by his basketball prioritization, a classic dualist fallacy), the venom they 
    unleash, and the passion with which they debate these pointless hierarchies, mirrors that of the armchair coaches/athletes on sports radio. More enraging than Clontle's inflammatory remarks 
    about Bowie, Zappa, and Neil Young ""rotting,"" and Madness ""inventing ska"" is his manner of turning the other cheek as callers become more confrontational; he lowers his mousy voice and 
    offers tidings such as ""keep rockin"" and ""enjoy the night."" Wurster as Clontle is amazingly quick, reacting to every caller's diatribe hilariously, or relying on the book's overstated subtitle/slogan: 
    ""It's The Ultimate Argument-Settler.""</p><p>
    Of the six shows on <i>Chain Fights, Beer Busts, And Service With A Grin</i>, the funniest is ""The Gorch"".  Roland Gorchnik--""63 years cool""--  claims to have been the inspiration for <i>Happy 
    Days' Fonzie, and has written a self-help book. As the interview progresses, Gorch quickly reveals that he is a sociopath, not just a lovable hoodlum. This skit manages to skewer 
    generation gaps, terminal adolescence, the seventies and eighties' love affair with a lobotomized version of the Eisenhower era, the patheticness of the almost-famous, the absurdity of 
    ""celebrity advice"" tomes, and the elasticity of pop icons.  Remember the Fonzie-centric Weezer video, or the cartoons on which Fonzie appeared, </i><i>Laverne And Shirley In The Army</i> and <i>Fonz 
    And The Happy Days Gang</i>, featuring the dog Mr. Cool, and Cupcake, girl from the future? It hits at how television softens America's underbelly-- wouldx92t a real Fonzie have been more 
    drunk, more thieving, more violent, and treated women worse than Henry Winkler's hardly chivalric get-over-here finger-snapper?</p><p>
    The Gorch is one of the machine-fixated cretins Marx predicted; 
    even his choice of weapons (pipes and chains) are talismans of the industrial revolution. The Gorch so represents an American scourge that he brags of beating up an entire ""baseball game."" 
    His homoerotic zeal for tussling with men (his band recorded a song called ""You=Beat Up"") and his motivational axioms (""College is for weak babies"") are fuggin uproarious. Laugh long and 
    hard at this relic from the ""good old days,"" code for when blacks had few civil rights.</p><p>
    The other five shows on the set are worthwhile. ""Radio Hut"" sends up the invasive interrogations to which Radio Shack subjects their customers, as well as that chaix92s overpriced, sub-cutting-edge 
    products. If you ever detected something ominous, something just-about-to-snap in the electronics store that feels like a shoe store, you'll find ""Radio Hut"" a riot. ""The Music Scholar"" regards those 
    Ari-Fleischer-smarmy record-geeks who namedrop as if their lives depend on it. This guest is a manifestation of elitism-as-brutality, reporting that he chastises customers of his store until they 
    are in tears. The Stooges were ""his thing"" at age ten, and then he dug Mauve, pre-Big Star demos,  rare Can, and Harry Partch. To him, the Residents and The Fall are ""teenyboppers.""</p><p>
    ""Citizens For 
    A True Democracy"" is almost not funny; the show involves a CEO Jr. who headed an Oliver-Stone-style cabal to ensure Bush's election. Though his arguments with stoned callers yield nervous 
    chuckles, this pre-boxcutter bit comes too close to summoning the united-front teetotalitarians who now run a majority of our government. ""Mike Healy"" teeters on misunderstood small talk that 
    gets blown exponentially out of proportion; this segment, though inventive, bears much in common with the quotidian-dread humor of Larry David's <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>, or his headier 
    episodes of <i>Seinfeld</i>. </p><p>
    These CDs reward repeat plays, even if Scharpling seems a little pent or vaudeville-hokey in his ""straight man"" role, biding time and repeating the setups of punchlines. Offering listeners the 
    voyeuristic thrill of the hoax but without stooping to cruelty, these radio shows would spice up a mean mix CD, or could work to combat the silence on that night when you and your 
    friend/lover begin to take each other for granted, lacking the will to even speak.</p></div>"|7710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7710-rock-rot-rule/|7.7|William Bowers

Then chances are you already know Peter Brötzmann's music.  The German
    saxophonist has made a career out of the kind of ear-shredding, lung-collapsing free jazz that makes most mortals run screaming for cover
    when it's thrown on the stereo; 36 years and counting from the release of his first record, Brötzmann still possesses the sandblasting tone that made
    his early LPs and performances the stuff of legend.  As the story goes, at one moment of particularly divine inspiration, the man blew through his horn
    so hard that he burst a blood vessel in his forehead. If that's not hardcore, I don't know what the hell is.</p><p>
<em>More Nipples</em> is the fifth archival Brötzmann release from Atavistic, under the wing of Chicago jazz gadfly John Corbett's Unheard Music Series.
    Although these tracks had been previously unavailable since being recorded in 1969, they come from the same meetings that produced Brötzmann's
    original <em>Nipples</em> LP (hence the title).  This session from April 18, 1969 put British improvisers Evan Parker and
    Derek Bailey into a once-in-a-lifetime sextet with Germans Brötzmann and Buschi Niebergall, and Dutch radicals Han Bennink and Fred van Hove (they'd 
    record as a quartet 6 days, later minus the Brits).  Unlike the alternate take filler that ruins most perfectly good jazz reissues, these are easily as
    good as the pieces that made it onto the original <em>Nipples</em>, and for 34-year-old tracks never intended for release, these recordings are 
    astonishingly clean.</p><p>
    The title track is 17 minutes of some of the most important music in the history of European free jazz-- a second run through the only piece
    recorded by this particular European Union of musicians.  As it unfolds with duos and trios crystallizing from the splinters of the entire group's
    nuclear mass, it's even more apparent how well these guys understood each other's playing, to the point of being conscious of what the group
    performance sounded like as a whole.  There are moments-- like Bennink's percussion fadeout on the precipice of Niebergall's bass solo-- that make it
    seem inconceivable these changes weren't written out beforehand.  It's also an unfortunate reminder of how compatible Brötzmann and Parker's polar
    opposite styles were-- if only their egos hadn't been too overpowering for them to work together very often after these recordings.</p><p>
    Of the quartet tracks, ""Fiddle-Faddle"" is the least revelatory, blistering along at an even keel with fairly programmatic free jazz structure until
    Niebergall's percussive bass and Bennink's hydra-limbed drum attack whirl up a remarkable climax.  ""Fat Man Walks"", on the other hand, is quite unusual
    in comparison to the rest of Brötzmann's late-60s work-- or just about any other European improv from that era.  The piece is built off of a peculiar
    gospel chord progression played by van Hove, setting up a melodic straitjacket that Brötzmann spends the song's first half trying to get loose
    from; when he finally succeeds, the force is so overwhelming that only Bennink can keep pace.</p><p>
    Don't let the fact that these are outtakes scare you away from this disc, because this stuff is essential to anyone interested in how Herr
    Brötzmann earned his status as one of the most devastating forces to ever touch a saxophone.  We can all benefit from a few more nipples
    in our lives.</p></div>"|967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/967-more-nipples/|8.9|Scott Hreha

It's easy to take the most well-executed, naturally powerful elements of a
    band's sound for granted never having heard the early, less-refined work they've grown from.  Such is the case with <i>5 Songs</i>, a reissue of the
    Decemberists' self-released first EP, which features an additional, title-nullifying sixth track.  The same crystal-clear, folk-informed sound that spun throughout the Portland
    band's beautiful full-length <i>Castaways &amp; Cutouts</i> is at the core of <i>5 Songs</i>, but singer Colin Meloy's potent, imaginative whimsy is passed up in favor of a
    more straightforward pop sensibility that's ultimately less rewarding.</p><p>
    Much has been made of the similarities between <i>Castaways &amp; Cutouts</i> and Neutral Milk Hotel's opus <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>.  The two albums do have a
    lot in common-- the similar vocal inflections of Meloy and Mangum and the intersecting themes of their material-- but Meloy's songs address mythical pasts with a certain degree
    of dream-like detachment, conjuring and retelling vivid images and tales while never participating directly.  Mangum, on the other hand, is a man possessed: he lives his stories, and describes
    them with a wrenching directness.</p><p>
    Meloy's subtle, observational tone seems like a moot point on <i>5 Songs</i>, which never tackles the same kind of involved, quasi-historical narratives of <i>Castaways</i>.  Not only is the
    EP thematically indistinct, the hazy red pastel clouds and ghostly, disembodied figures of <i>Castaways</i> are replaced with sharp, distinct outlines.  Generally speaking, <i>5 Songs</i>
    is a much more steady and controlled batch of songs, with none of the unsettling undertones of its winding successor.</p><p>
<i>5 Songs</i> does convey a subtle sense of melancholy, through laid-back melodies and evocative instrumentation.  The opener ""Oceanside"" is definitely one of the best offerings here,
    a backdrop of acoustic guitars and accordion painting a vivid picture of some lonely foreign port, perfectly framing Meloy's longing, nautical lyrics.  The more uptempo ""Shiny"" fails to develop
    a particularly moving refrain, relying too heavily upon bits of slide guitar worked into a disappointingly formless structure.</p><p>
    ""Angel, Wox92t You Call"" almost delivers on the sparse broken promise of ""Shiny"", building to a powerful chorus, but it stops just short.  The appended ""Apology Song"" is simply out of place, with
    lame, awkward couplets like ""I'm really sorry Steven/ But your bicycle's been stolen.""  Meloy is much more adept describing the regret of a soldier at Burkenau than that of some dude who lost
    his friend's bike; it's hard to take ""Apology Song"" as anything more than a hokey inside joke, and that can almost cheapen the resonance of his more potent latter-day lyrics.</p><p>
    Though <i>5 Songs</i> is by no means a bad release, its relative lack of substance when compared to <i>Castaways</i> is close to staggering; it makes the latter both a relief and a revelation, as
    the powerful songwriting hinted at here is fully realized.  But it's easy to see how <i>Castaways</i> is an evolution from <i>5 Songs</i>, which suggests that claims of
    theft or simple imitation hurled at Meloy are somewhat exaggerated, if not outright unfounded.</p></div>"|2240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2240-5-songs-ep/|7.3|Matt LeMay

Searching for buried booty or bass?  I'm sure some guy named Papa Dadfather or Gold Card Grinder can point you in the 
    right direction, but hold on to your alligator-skin bathrobe, Bear Bryant-- the crimson tide has turned!  By way of Georgia, Kentucky, and Florida, the CunninLynguists have been operating 
    in a different hip-hop realm than their geographical brethren.  <i>Will Rap For Food</i> (2001) was a solid, accessible debut, filled with clever rhymes and tremendously consistent production, 
    and the deservedly strong support system it garnered had fans hoping Deacon and Kno (now accompanied by SOS) would someday realize their potential and drop a certified gem on 
    the masses.  When <i>Southernunderground</i> was finally announced for this year, eyes widened.</p><p> 
    Kno proves himself one of hip-hop's preeminent producers on this record, handling the beat duties on nearly every track.  He exquisitely sets up backdrops to match the lyrical subject 
    matter: the bass heavy first-half of \x93Raix94 props up a drifting piano line, soon pushing into a splash of building cymbals. And just like it's hot, everything drops out into Sir Elton John 
    crooning, ""Wise man say/ Looks like rain today."" Captain Fantastic has never sounded so distressing.</p><p> 
    ""Falling Down"" is Kno's masterpiece, tracing three separate tales of domestic and workplace woe, each exploding midway into perverted destruction. Devoid of any subtlety (gunshots and screams 
    abound), the kick-drum goes berserk as each emcee snaps. This is a drum-and-bass firestorm that practically drowns the vocals of Deacon doing his best Michael Douglas impression: 
    ""Muthafucka is my one car really halting movement?/ I got some powerful shit in my trunk, want me to use it?"" Other production highlights include the slippery jazz guitar in ""Doin' Alright"", as 
    well as its blissful second interlude-- just thirty seconds of that shames a horde of current beatsmiths. It makes the RJD2 contribution ""Seasons"" (incidentally the lead single) sound lazy and 
    heartless. Domingo's title track feels redundant after just one verse. With all due respect to Deacon and SOS, the CunninLynguists would be nothing without Kno. He is in a league of his own-- 
    when it comes to production.</p><p>
    The point of contention on <i>Southernunderground</i> is the vocals. On a technical level, Deacon, SOS, and Kno (yes, rapping) are all lyrically adequate, and there isn't much to complain about 
    delivery-wise, either, but the downfall to this album is something the dudes can't help: their voices. Deacon and SOS are virtually indistinguishable in tone, not to mention vocabulary; at times, 
    Kno begins to sound like the Swollen Members' Madchild (and that's not a compliment). His sincerest lines can fall flat, even over the most disquietingly affecting tracks. When he tries to come 
    through on upbeat party jamz (""The South""), all I hear is a clumsy excitement that sounds like someone scored Mom's Lexus for Friday night. Also, sampling brutally distinct voices between their 
    own (Big Pun, Andre 3000, etc.) makes the guys sound even less convincing.</p><p>
    Call it contemptuous, but <i>Southernunderground</i> finds ways to get under my skin in its subject matter as well. After hearing lines like ""Let me rub some lotion on your cleavage,"" how can I 
    take contemplation on romantic depression (""Love Ain't"") seriously? Look at the beginning of ""Old School"" too: ""New jacks?/ Y'all some new jacks!/ We Old School."" While the song humorously 
    delves into hanging out with Henry VIII and Einstein, early ""teacher"" posturing always turns me off. Couple this with the album title, and all I can be reminded of is an MTV2 commercial showing 
    a bunch of goons on Market St. drooling out phrases like ""Yeah...underground. Elevate the music...beats and rhymes."" Aligning themselves with this generic self-reference and ""authentication"" is 
    superfluous.</p><p>
    I don't want to sell this album short, though: <i>Southernunderground</i> contains the most reliable production of the year thus far. Yes, the CunninLynguists are capable on the microphone, and their 
    voices could go over just fine to you. If you subscribe at all to the theory that ""an album is only as good as its production,"" buy it. Apologies if the group poured their blood, sweat, and tears into this 
    one, and I don't know it the means to it are maturity or Kno ghostwriting, but mark my words: some day, the CunninLynguists will release a flawless record.</p></div>"|1689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1689-southernunderground/|7.4|Matt Kallman

    of any challenging experimentation, politics, or off-kilter production.  None of that, nah.</p><p>
    
    What got me nervous about this album is that, for his reputation, it's the most drab, adult-oriented product to make it to my stereo since 
    some Starbucks-sipping visitor got sentimental about the <i>Magnolia</i> soundtrack.  ""Those frogs were symbolic!"" he cried, and asked 
    me to bow with him before his shrine to Aimee Mann.</p><p>
    
    It's here we enter the world of the tame, a land where Sting is king and Phil Collins is raucous.  It's the bottled atmosphere of Borders, the safety a slightly left-wing baby boomer 
    craves as they sip tea and read bestsellers about other baby boomers. It's Jeff Healey.  Lanois writes somewhat catchy, almost moody stuff, but when I say ""moody"" I mean like a 
    CEO gets moody when there isn't enough whole milk in his latte.</p><p>
    
    My dad's a nice man. I imagine him not only liking <i>Shine</i>, but also finding it soothing; he could downright chill to this. If pops and I were resting on his overstuffed 
    couch, the few things on <i>Shine</i> I enjoyed-- faint bells during the first minute of ""I Love You"", off-key guitar, chimes, a pedal steel-- wouldn't make an impression on him, while 
    the many things he'd love-- ""This reminds me of a less crazy <i>Astral Weeks</i>!""-- would have me flashing back to the summer I interned at <i>Musician Magazine</i>, brewing weak 
    coffee for Rush fans with fake tans and male-pattern-baldness ponytails.</p><p>
    
    The production on <i>Shine</i> is beyond clean: slide guitar winds in like a coma, tumbleweeds bounce into the sky, a creepy voice exhales and makes me jump. Layers 
    and distances are detailed, but nothing overlaps or crowds, always shiny. Anesthetic, like a commercial.</p><p>
    
    Lanois produced the record himself, and if you don't know his name, he also produced Bob Dylan's <i>Time Out of Mind</i>, Peter Gabriel's <i>So</i> and <i>Us</i>, and U2's <i>The Joshua 
    Tree</i> and <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i>, to list but a few of his credits.  So no, I'm not talking DIY: his microphones probably cost more than my apartment. Maybe you're a 
    better person than I am, maybe you can hurdle the squeaky-clean production.  Answer me this: do you find the Counting Crows moving? If so, you're halfway there.</p><p>
    
    Aside from the overproduction, the songwriting is pat: none of the tracks deviate from what's laid out in the first stanza: ""No need to worry about surprises, sir/ Just sit back and 
    relax, sir.""  Three of the four instrumentals are decent, clean versions of Will Oldham's <i>Odes</i>, while ""Space Key"" takes the ghostly atmospherics of ""Transmitter"" 
    and ""JJ Leaves L.A."", including a drum machine so crisp, it's as if you're forever riding into the sunset, leaving town on 70mm stock.</p><p>
    
    What Lanois always has, no matter what he brings to the table personally, is star power. Emmylou Harris offers backup on the album opener,  ""I Love You"", and Bono chimes in with a 
    mellow vocal turn on the second track, ""Pretty Falling At Your Feet"".  The sunglassed one wrote the track with Lanois during the <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i> sessions; for 
    all his shallow pomposity, Bono can be tolerable-- even pretty-- when he isn't trying to pretend he's smarter than he is.</p><p>
     
    What does Lanois himself sound like? He sounds like everyman-- he's French Canadian.  No accent; he could be a newscaster in the Heartland. There's no doubt he's an 
    accomplished producer, but he drops the ball trying to communicate anything other than light-weight, overextended metaphors: ""My tremolo, you're 
    my fire...what keeps me walking is your shine."" His odd musings are especially grating because he mixes the vocals so high.</p><p>
    
    Final litmus test: in the liner notes Lanois writes, ""What a privilege to be able to make music.Here is a small portion of what's cooking in the kitchen.  I hope that some piece of 
    it will elevate your spirit. May we all touch a heart somewhere, sometime.""  Your gut reaction to his best wishes is a solid indication of how palatable you'll find <i>Shine</i>.</p></div>"|4950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4950-shine/|5.6|Brandon Stosuy

I don't care if he's pretentious,
    I don't care if he does retarded airplane dances onstage, I don't care if he squats over a mirror with two
    fingers up his ass. I don't care if his self-martyring lyrics are written and performed for the sole purpose
    of getting pussy, or if he's a tortured genius making esoteric-surreal-referential art, or if he wrote this
    entire album while sniffing rails of coke and listening to Louis Armstrong records (whose voice he
    approximates on ""No Corporate News Is Good News"", and which is probably one of the most offensive/creepy
    moments on <i>In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust</i>). I'm just glad he's given up the gory melodrama
    of <i>How Memory Works</i>, even if that means we get the fractured poetic dadaist freakout stuff on recent
    JOA records-- including <i>Rape Fantasy</i>-- instead.</p><p>
    
    The fact is, Tim Kinsella is a figurehead in the realm of independent music because of the vehement reaction
    of his critics, fans, and deriders. There's just no in between: people either love him with frothing passion
    or hate him with ferocious vitriol, to the point that he matters at least as much as any other artist in the
    increasingly gray area of what we call indie rock, purely because of indie rock's cultural reaction to him.</p><p>
    
    So. In interviews, Kinsella has said this record consists of outtakes from their February full-length <i>So
    Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness</i>-- the ones that Jade Tree thought sucked. This is a cursed way for
    a piece of art to come into the world, with the knowledge of being unwanted and second-best. But one lady's
    trash is another lady's treasure, as they say, and to me, the cache of ""weird"" songs on <i>Rape Fantasy</i>
    is better than the tracks collected on <i>Staying Alive</i>.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it seems stronger because there's less pained singing and more instrumentation, which can be awfully
    pretty at times (even when it oscillates in noise wankouts), or maybe it's because of the personas Kinsella
    tests out on different tracks: he sings, ""Ignorance is my privileged right,"" in a protest of American apathy
    and suddenly, he's Frank Zappa; the aforementioned Louis Armstrong impression is, if nothing else, uncharted
    territory; and then there's Tim's old failsafe, the grating, wailing juvenile toddler, which he's channeled
    at every opportunity for the better half of Joan of Arc's career.</p><p>
    
    Kinsella's toddler persona comes directly to the fore on ""Happy 1984 and 2001"", as he begins intoning the
    ""shadow government"" chorus in that scrawly whine (you know the one), and then lists other kinds of shadows
    in a children's theater-style singsong (""sidewalk shadow, cowboy shadow, BBQ shadow, hackeysack shadow)--
    a sort of ""Now I Know My ABC's"" of the illuminati.  Kinsella's harped on the government a lot recently,
    which fits in nicely with his contempt for authority (boyhood Catholicism seems to be at the core of
    ""Dinosaur Constellations Part 1"", when he repeatedly screams, ""God is the bomb""), and also with his inner
    conspiracy theorist.  But you know.  I don't care about those things.</p><p>
    
    Here's what I do care about, really: a semblance of human emotion, a snippet of beauty, a boatload of comedy,
    some musical friction and a good story. <i>In Rape Fantasy and Terror Sex We Trust</i>-- and by extension,
    Tim Kinsella-- possesses those things at varying points, and sometimes all at once. On ""Them Brainwash Days"",
    someone credited as ""Ingersol Torniquet"" reads unintelligible poetry while a graceful guitar blossoms quietly,
    a steady drum beats, and a piano unfurls-- and to paraphrase Kinsella, it's just nice.  On ""Them Heartache
    Nights"", austere vocal samples and another burst of pretty guitar fill out the emotion requirement.  In the
    simple beauty of these moments, the question has to be asked: what could Joan of Arc accomplish if they
    tossed aside their shock-rock tactics and primal scream therapy, and aimed for this instead?</p><p>
    
    It seems to me that when they're just spazzing the fuck out, it's not for a lack of talent on the behalf of
    the players-- which, this time out includes members of Califone, Friend/Enemy, 90 Day Men, Ghosts and Vodka,
    Chicago Underground, Bent Leg Fatima, and just about every other Chicago-based indie session player you can
    think of-- it's just a lack of attention span.  The formula is for everyone to play what sounds like random
    measures at once; it's not about applying the aesthetics of free jazz to indie rock, so much as getting a
    bunch of kids on Kool-Aid to jam out together in the basement.  The results are never brilliant or violently
    disagreeable-- just kind of funny and weird.</p><p>
<i>In Rape Fantasy</i> is more of a curio than anything-- think of it as Duchamp's suitcase meets Richard
    Pryor's <i>Bicentennial Nigger</i>.  But for all the squawky, experimental shit that gives this band its
    divisive controversy, there are some genuinely nice arty folk moments that would probably get more credit
    were it not for Kinsella's by-now well established persona.  I don't care what side you're on-- if you think
    this man is this generation's Ginsberg or an idiot fooling no one; when he lets his act slip and indulges
    his melodic vice, he proves himself far more talented than he otherwise lets on.</p></div>"|4267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4267-in-rape-fantasy-and-terror-sex-we-trust/|5.0|Julianne Shepherd

Ask Christopher Walken. Even when Dubya visited the smoking holes at Ground Zero, he deferred to then-King Rudy Guiliani. So 
    it goes in the art world: who else but Matthew Barney could command the entire Guggenheim and have Björk sire his child?</p><p>
    New York sets up more of a duality in its music worlds: there's always contention and tension in the air of premieres, the two lords evenly matched and equally 
    powerful, landing formidable punches with each new expression. In jazz you have John Zorn and William Parker; way back when, it was Bird and Diz blowing, first together, 
    then at crosswinds. Unearthed tapes from folks like Tony Conrad, John Cale, and Charlemagne Palestine continually contest the supposed reign of minimalist La Monte Young; 
    into the seventies, Steve Reich and Phillip Glass were upping the inverse ante with their ensemble sizes (6 marimbas to 12 Parts to 18 Musicians).</p><p>
    In the eighties, it was the rock muck of Sonic Youth and Swans, exchanging asphalt-hard blows on audiences' ears like long-banged champs. Further underground, there was the 
    guitar-symphony battle 
    for supremacy between avid pupil Glenn Branca and teacher Rhys Chatham, an arms race of detuned six-strings building up to Hundred Guitar Armies the likes of which Tommy 
    Garrett never imagined during the cold war-- Branca even marched them through the World Trade Plaza way back in the early 21st Century. While leaner Branca has released ten symphonies 
    on disc, master Chatham has been neglected.</p><p>
    Consider this the Equalizer. The Bomb. Chatham's got The Box.</p><p>
    \x93Two Gongs\x94 opens this set, a piece composed in 1971 but appearing here as documented in 1988. It seems simple, even in the hazy dawn of American Minimalism; less concerned 
    with the piano patterns of Terry Riley and La Monte, and more with the pure physicality of sine waves pursued by Maryann Amacher and Charlemagne Palestine in their electronic work, 
    Chatham found as much kif-kin in each hit of Chinese gongs as he did in his work with the early Buchla synthesizer (the cornerstone technology of the Intermedia Center at NYU in the late sixties). 
    The resulting investigation of these gongs sounds not so much like an idealized <i>Music of the Spheres</i> as it is a ""Music of Two Enormous Fucking Ball Bearings the Size of Jupiter 
    Grinding Together like Electric Teenagers"".  Heavenly, yes, but with enough sharp metal shavings and distorted sparks as to spray in your eyes over its sixty minutes.</p><p>
    For those who won't find an hour's worth of gong vibration invigorating, head directly to disc two. Buzzing and bursting forth with six guitars on \x93Die Donnergötter\x94, Chatham's motley crew-- 
    featuring future Illbient-blower Ben Neill, ex-Modern Lover Ernie Brooks, Susan Stenger from Band of Susans, and the Dictators' drummer-- plows down a speedy superhighway of black 
    tar rock and roll, paving the space between Televisiox92s ascendant <i>Marquee Moon</i> and Neu!'s motorik downbeat. The overlapping dust storms of tones kicked up by way of the 
    guitar stretch far over the horizon of detuned, droning rock, a point reiterated over and over again as the set continues.</p><p>
    Aside from the Lee Renaldo-penned epiphany from 1977, wedged into the 140-page booklet, ""Guitar Trio"" succinctly lays out the career trajectory for Sonic Youth in eight sustaining minutes. With 
    David Linton providing a kicked-kit push on drums, three open-tuned guitars let flow pure, humming-head streams that quickly become a current of cascading electrified overtones and sheer 
    delight. From this body of sonic wash came all other noisy guitars for the next thirty years, to fill their respective canteens: Mars, Theoretical Girls, Band of Susans, Ut, Swans, and the 
    aforementioned Youth, even latter day practitioners of sonic overload ranging from My Bloody Valentine to the Trail of Dead. No matter who it inspired, the piece proves that no one quite 
    had the vessel-- the distillation process-- much less quenched any thirst for tone overload quite like Rhys during those hectic times. The fact that the third guitarist on this piece (Branca) 
    would explore the same ideas to even greater success reveals the wellspring Chatham had loosed in New York City. </p><p>
    \x93Drastic Classicism\x94 is far more fast and furious than its ""minimal"" tag would lead you to believe. Four chariots roll on fiery Brimstone tires in a savage Drive Like Jehu drag 
    race; the noise on these tracks is more than most ensembles could ever hope to hit, but not even Jehu could keep up with these gear changes, flowing and grinding until 
    the wheels fall off, even burning through the re-entry that \x93Eliminator Jr.\x94 brought at the end of <i>Daydream Nation</i>.</p><p>
    Variables focused on in previous works-- volume, trajectory, velocity-- culminate in Rhys' final revelation of electric guitar with the title work, \x93An Angel Moves Too Fast to See"".  Scored 
    for one hundred guitars and toured throughout Europe, it's the only one of three such pieces that has ever been documented, premiering here. Despite the sheer impossibility of recording 
    one hundred guitars and accurately conveying that force, there are huge movements from the group, roving from Chatham's classic colossal bustle into \x93Interstellar Overdrive\x94-like drift, 
    even into a curious place that resembles...a hundred dudes playing the opening punches of \x93Eye of the Tiger\x94.</p><p>
    Dump out his peripheral role-playing: the work with Morton Subotnick in the sixties, his time tuning harpsichords and pianos for the likes of Glenn Gould and La Monte Young, founding venerated 
    music outlet The Kitchen and introducing Canal Street bludgeonings of electric guitar to academic minimal marks. Even if you're feeling Spartan, cutting out all the non-guitar works here 
    (as most of his focus these days lies in brass), you'd still have a huge reckoning with one of the downtown greats looming larger than the Federal Reserve building. Chatham is huge, and that the 
    box grasps so much of that significance makes it a crowning achievement.</p></div>"|1408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1408-an-angel-moves-too-fast-to-see-selected-works-1971-1989/|9.1|Andy Beta

On his third album in the last six
    months, Japan's Nobukazu Takemura closes his laptop, sits down with partner
    Aki Tsuyuko, and makes an album of songs backed with (mostly) acoustic
    instruments. In the past, Tsuyuko has provided the vocal inspiration for
    career highlights like ""Kepler"" and ""Wax &amp; Wane"", though on the last couple
    of Takemura projects she's been replaced by processed and computer-generated
    voices. While not a technically adept vocalist (she's a keyboard player by
    training, and her own solo material is instrumental), Tsuyuko's simple and
    direct style has been the right accompaniment for Takemura's child's-eye view.
    Pairing the two over the course of an album sounds like heaven for admirers
    of twee electronics.</p><p>
    Problems are evident on the opening ""Mirror Tower"", which is just Takemura's
    nylon-stringed guitar and Tsuyuko's voice. Tsuyuko's notes sound almost
    random, for one thing-- there's essentially no melody.  It has a certain
    Shaggs-ish charm, I guess, in that it sounds ""innocent"" and so forth, but
    the track is all atmosphere and no <em>song</em>.</p><p>
    Fortunately, ""Mahou No
    Hiroba"" is a terrific follow-up. There's still not much in the way of a
    tune, but ""Mahou No Hiroba"" is less about melodic development, and more
    of endless build through repetition. There's propulsion in the blend of
    acoustic guitars, vibes, organ and crisp jazz-style drums (which I believe
    are programmed); the way the song stacks its blocky chords almost seems like
    a gentle, discordant, far-East version of Stereolab's ""Jenny Ondioline"".
    This track is nine minutes long but doesn't seem it, and it's one of the
    best things Takemura has done.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, nothing else here comes close to ""Mahou No Hiroba"". With 19
    tracks running almost 80 minutes, <i>Songbook</i> is way, way, <em>way</em> too
    long, but that's come to be expected from Nobukazu Takemura. When he has a
    good idea he tends to drive it into the ground, making the listener tire of
    the track before it ends. But on <i>Songbook</i>, the good ideas don't come
    often enough. Roughly half the tracks sound like throwaways, nothing more than
    some clever instrumental flourishes laid beneath Tsuyuko's off-key warbling.</p><p>
    I consider myself a pretty serious Nobukazu Takemura fan and I enjoyed Aki
    Tsuyuko's solo record, but I honestly can't understand what <em>anybody</em>
    could get from ""From the Ocean of Forest"", ""Tadpole in the Puddle"" or
    ""Obaoba""; there's just nothing there, no melody, harmony, hook or texture.
    Plenty of great tunes have come from singers who could only sing three or
    four notes, but all of these had someone behind them who knew how to use
    that handful of tones to their best advantage. Both Takemura and Tsuyuko
    sound utterly lost inside most of these tracks.</p><p>
    There are a few exceptions, like ""Turutiksbinbon (Fr ver)"" (easily the best
    <i>tune</i> of the bunch, though the melody only lasts two bars and still
    goes on for 8+ minutes) and ""Uruu"" (which, with its thick organ and breathy
    vocals, reminds me a lot of Björk). These few highlights and the fantastic
    ""Mahou No Hiroba"" keep <i>Songbook</i> from being flat-out <em>bad</em>, but
    just barely.  As an album of songs, <i>Songbook</i> fails. A major disappointment.</p></div>"|7918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7918-songbook/|5.6|Mark Richardson

He's wounded and wailing, but then he abruptly takes command; he quivers vulnerably,
    his voice warbling as his heart deflates, and then he roars his demands, like a lioness that follows orders
    without hiding her claws.  Hawksley Workman assaults his songs with butch sexual charge, the camp and
    flamboyance of a junior league pop diva-- so much that, well, not to question anyone's identity, but he's
    gotta be, you know, British.</p><p>
    
    Workman actually hails from the less glamorous nation of Canada.  In the strange, maybe made-up biography
    on his website, he writes that he's a country boy whose life changed when he moved to the city and took up
    residence in a dance studio.  Working day and night to earn his keep and learn his art, he became a dancer
    who has held the Dutch Royal Family in his thrall.  And after learning to sing and collecting some garish
    stage outfits, he took up a new career as a burgeoning international pop star, with three records under his
    belt: <i>For Him and the Girls</i>, a Christmas album called <i>Almost a Full Moon</i>, and now <i>(Last
    Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves</i>.</p><p>
    
    Far and away his greatest strength is his voice.  Owing some influence to idols like Bowie or Freddie Mercury,
    his style has been compared to Britain's 70s glam pop age: his sexual energy encompasses and then tosses
    aside plain old macho cock-rock.  Whether caterwauling through ""You and Me and the Weather"", moaning low
    like Robert Plant, or barking orders to an anonymous plaything in ""Striptease"", Workman not only possesses
    chrome-plated pipes, but the style to use them.</p><p>
    
    Workman recorded this album almost entirely by himself at home: that's him hammering out the tight piano part
    on ""Jealous of Your Cigarette"", or working the guitar like he's humping a pole.  Ditching the folk and country
    tinge that colored his first album, the music goes from a rhythm-and-blues urgency to drawn-out almost
    schmaltzy musical theater.  But even if Workman's putting just about everything he has into performing this
    music, the material he wrote can't keep up: it just jogs along while he's singing up a storm; and for someone
    who can spew purple prose-- he's even published a book of love letters, <i>Hawksley Burns for Isadora</i>--
    the lyrics range from lurid and rambling, to obvious and dull.  ""I'm jealous of your cigarette/ And all the
    things you do with it,"" works as not-too-subtle camp, but later in the song he spells out the innuendo
    (""...and how you want to suck on it), and that's just gauche.</p><p>
    
    Although the singles that kick off the disc are almost lunkheadedly blunt, they still carry more charge than
    the later songs which, while smart and often catchy, are strangely defanged.  ""Clever Not Beautiful"" is
    actually neither, running on seemingly forever; the piano ballad ""Lethal and Young"" tries to sum up
    the perils of youth, but ends up just waving a finger at them.  Even though there are charming melodies on
    songs like ""Your Beauty Must Be Rubbing Off""-- almost every track is well-honed and catchy-- Workman gets
    too cute and puckish; end-to-end the record grows cloying, losing the edge that the first few songs promised.</p><p>
    
    Where's that tension, the ambiguous charge that sends your neckhairs crawling?  The album hints at something
    worthy of Workman's craftsmanship and charisma: something that aches more, or shows less, or doesn't sound
    so damn theatrical.  As is, it doesn't dig deep enough into what drives him; is this erotic and raw, or is
    it just needily pawing at us?</p></div>"|8737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8737-last-night-we-were-the-delicious-wolves/|6.7|Chris Dahlen

    the unity of HipHop Kulture."" Since then, events have been held in cities across America, from New York to
    San Francisco, to appreciate hip-hop and hopefully subvert some of the dickwads in the conservative media
    that continue to paint hip-hop culture as the sole root of our country's moral decline. It's a noble cause--
    one that promotes KRS' ongoing devotion to ""edutainment"" and gets communities involved in the four elements--
    and respect is due.  However, I think they need some people working on the public imaging over there at the
    Temple of HipHop, 'cause this year, the theme is... ""responsibility!""</p><p>
    
    Now. While I'm all for behaving responsibly and not painting hip-hop in a bad light by, like, bumping Outkast
    out my boombox while shoplifting or something, there hasn't been a wonkier, more awkward theme for a positive
    event since <i>Back to the Future</i>'s ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" prom motto. Responsibility. Since when
    did I go back to kindergarten? Was this in the syllabus? And most importantly, I thought we were gonna be
    getting some ""tainment"" with our ""edu.""</p><p>
    
    Initially, I was feeling the same incredulity towards KRS collaborator Akrobatik's second record, which is
    titled, simply, <i>Balance</i>, and comes jam-packed with laidback, conscious, message-driven hip-hop.  But
    where I expected raps about yoga or the medicinal benefits of yerba mate tea, I got: ""Ring the sweat out ya
    pores when you done with these verbal calisthenics"" and ""When I kick intricate shit you get intimate witchya
    brain.""  Even when I thought Akrobatik (aka ""the black action figure with the kung fu grip"") might start to
    get preachy about his responsible way of life, he instead spat, ""I don't waste my time writin' ignorant rhymes,
    but I know that makin' niggas laugh ain't no crime."" (Friends at Temple of HipHop, please take note.)</p><p>
    
    The Boston lyricist's themes are all fairly simple-- ""Balance"" is about balance, ""Hypocrite"" is about
    hypocrisy, ""Time"" examines of the concept of time and reality-- and his storytelling-rich style is smooth
    and easygoing. But, keeping with the theme, Akrobatik's raps are balanced with occasionally intense
    production by DJ Sense, DJ Therapy, Da Beatminerz, Edan, and DJ Fakts One (with whom Akrobatik and Mr.
    Lif have a crew, called The Perceptionists).</p><p>
    
    The Edan and Fakts One cuts work best with Akrobatik's style,
    complimenting his relatively straightforward delivery with complex, isolated drumming which sometimes
    unravels simple breakbeats only to embellish them with surprising, firework-clatter drum fills, confident
    bass buzz, and quirky funk.  Later, Akrobatik himself takes a stab at funk in his self-produced duet with
    Mr. Lif, ""Wreck Dem""-- one of the record's best, despite that Lif's higher-pitched, sharper delivery steals
    the show out from under Akrobatik's lower timbre.  In short, Akro's style is of an older, simpler school--
    perhaps the same one where ""responsibility"" could pass as a theme without needing a fancy spin to entice
    the cynics.</p></div>"|90.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/90-balance/|7.2|Julianne Shepherd

Christ, what an awful term.  Maybe it's my German heritage rearing its ugly head, but I'll
    forever curse Faust for a song title so incredibly dumb, yet so easily appropriated to represent this
    movement-in-retrospect.  ""What are you listening to?"" asks the cute girl sandwiched next to you on the bus.
    ""Amon Düül,"" you reply, intoning each umlaut with native-speaker authenticity.  ""Huh?""  ""It's <em>Krautrock</em>.""
    End of discussion.</p><p>
    Not that the alternatives are much better: ""musik kosmische?""  That just opens the way for even more
    deplorable German-derived academispeak like ""gestalt,"" ""bildungsroman,"" or, uh, ""doppelgänger.""  I suppose
    the English translation-- ""cosmic music""-- works as well as any; it's definitely music and it's sure as
    hell cosmic, but that's probably not likely to impress a potential date either, is it?</p><p>
    Well, Purple Pyramid's attempt to sample Amon Düül's glory days with the United Artists label is similarly
    unimpressive, though not for lack of trying.  The thought of boiling down eight albums' worth of the Düül's
    extraterrestrial slop into one single-disc showcase is a nightmarish idea in execution and import, but to
    the compilers' credit, <em>The UA Years</em> gives a small, sweet taste of each record, and guarantees a boost
    in sales for their other reissues (to anyone lucky enough to find them).</p><p>
<em>Yeti</em>-- the band's uncontested 1970 masterpiece-- draws the heaviest representation with four songs
    that showcase Amon Düül II as acid-rock improvisers of the highest order.  ""Archangel Thunderbird"" and ""Soap
    Shop Rock"" cast the group as something akin to a communal Black Sabbath, turning sludgy riffs and tremulous
    vocals into haphazard jewels, while ""Cerberus"" takes a more mystical approach, as the rambling open-tuned
    acoustic jam fades into a phased-out electric hoedown without so much as a thread left hanging askew. If
    you remember one piece of information in this review, let it be that <em>Yeti</em> is Amon Düül II's crowning
    achievement.</p><p>
    As far as the other records are concerned, this compilation provides several generous points of entry for
    even the most timid consumers. 1973's <em>Wolf City</em> comes in a close second to <em>Yeti</em>, thanks to the
    way their quintessential hippie-prog exploration ""Wie der Wind am Ende Einer Strasse"" plays gentle contrast
    to the cosmic grandiosity of ""Surrounded by the Stars"" and the consciousness-rattling voices that float
    around the mix of <em>Wolf City</em>'s title track.  The tracks from 1972's <em>Live in London</em> stack the
    deck further: ""Race from Here to Your Ears"" is a full-out rock avalanche dusted with synth gurgles and
    violin slashes, while ""Improvisations"" rocks an outlandish drone that erupts into a Lennon-esque choogle,
    complete with Renate Knaup-Krötenschwanz's best Yoko-in-a-bag impersonation.</p><p>
    But the most massive hurdle to overcome while listening to this disc-- and the reason that it's not at all
    recommendable to anyone already familiar with Amon Düül-- is the rampant excerpting of longer tracks to make
    room for a wider view of their work.  Because once you've acquired a predilection for the band's sidelong
    trips to the outer limits, the bits and pieces on display here are hard to digest.  Hearing them in this
    misaligned context also shows how dated some of this stuff can be, especially the straight-outta-<em>Spinal
    Tap</em> ""Deutsch Népal"" and its medieval German voice-over; if you can't picture the band dancing around a
    miniature Stonehenge while playing this one, then I'll see you at the Renaissance Faire (sike!).</p><p>
    Despite its shortcomings, I can't stress enough that <em>The UA Years</em> is an admirably assembled
    introduction to one of the most stylistically restless bands under the Krautrock banner.  It's just that,
    personally, when the cosmic egg finally does crack, I expect to see the entire universe-- not a handful of
    stars and dust.</p></div>"|167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/167-the-ua-years-1969-1974/|7.9|Scott Hreha

This is the tale of The Apes' epic travels in pursuit of the precognitive, post-cognitive two-headed
    Gemini butterfly!  Marvel at the primal beauty of the Forest of Confusion!  Tremble before the psychic might
    of Brainbow and Brainbro, free-floating nerve-clusters bent on constructing ""robot bodies to spread disease!""
    Be inadvertently confused by the sudden appearance of some dude (Ape?  Maybe!) named Worwiz, who knows ""all
    there is to know!""  Say your prayers and wet your pants as he detonates a world-ending nuclear blast!  Actually,
    on second thought, maybe Worwiz is the butterfly.  I'm sure there's a story here, but I'm also sure that I'm
    not crazy enough to ""get it.""  Remember when The Apes used to be content to just namecheck apes a lot?</p><p>
    
    Journeys far from the wilds of their native D.C. have deepened this band, it seems, and I'm not just referring
    to the evil absurdity of <i>Oddeyesee</i>'s ""plot.""  Materially, the concept isn't particularly enlightening,
    though it never fails to entertain (if only out of the sheer conviction behind the insanity), but it's the
    band's music that's really seen the benefits of evolution.  The Apes no longer need to relentlessly assert
    dominance through layer after layer of pulverizing bass and crash cymbals; the Moog/organ combo-- once merely
    a garnish to distract from the lack of guitars-- now subtly brings its way to the fore, leading with the
    carrot instead of the whip.  Fans of The Apes' debut's slope-browed, knuckle-dragging aggression, don't
    fret: it hasn't gone the way of the way of the dodo, it's just a little tamer now, more focused.</p><p>
    
    You'd never know it from the opening, though: The Apes' killer instincts take control, surrounding the
    listener just seconds into ""Intro"".  Angry jungle drums pound away from all angles, panning back and forth
    across the channels before an ominously simple bass riff introduces the echoing, otherworldly narrator, who
    makes clear the nature of <i>Oddeyesee</i>'s unique vision.  ""I-Magic"" immediately hints at The Apes'
    more civilized tendencies, though; by their own admission, they're now ""twice as smart and half as blind.""
    Here, the just-barely-under-control dynamic between soaring organ fills, Paul Weil's agonized, wild-eyed
    vocals, and the doomsday percussion shows just how far they've come.  All aspects of their sound have been
    mastered, unified into an overwhelming, but-- and this is the real trick-- <i>not overpowering</i> force;
    it's direct evidence of the vastly improved songwriting on <i>Oddeyesee</i>, and there's more to come.</p><p>
    
    The Apes still tend to get by on psyched-out riff repetition, drilling through monolithic rhythmic
    progressions, but the organ's increased prominence causes them to never rely too heavily on any one element.
    In many ways, the arch complexity of Amanda Kleinman's work at the keys is a crystallization of The Apes'
    newfound refinement, and frequently serves as the primary melodic focus.  ""Myops' Coin-Ops"" segues effortlessly
    through rolling bass crescendos, organ trills and fills, and sinister breakdowns, never lingering on any
    section long enough to even show wear.  Trippy, ritualistic chanting fuses with 60s psychedelia before
    dissolving into an ingenious manipulation of stock B-Movie organ lines in ""Village of Brainbow and Brainbro""
    (seriously); it's goofy as hell, but so perfectly executed and so bizarrely fitting with the overall mood
    of the album that it's almost impossible not to enjoy.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, as on ""While Majestic Ape Sleeps"", the haunting call of the lone organ is all that can be heard,
    and the shift from rock adrenaline to such delicate, almost ethereal atmospherics is utterly gorgeous.  ""Big
    Fog"" takes that idea a step further, combining graceful Moog riffs, soaring organ refrains and bass drums
    that thunder with ultimate, bruising intensity.  These more ""experimental"" cuts may actually be the finest
    moments on an album rich with blasts of awe-inspiring firepower.  Sometimes the band's more ambient leanings
    cause them to briefly stumble (the spacey drone of ""How You Like Me Now"" leaps instantly to mind), but the
    dividends paid by the decision to rein in their self-indulgent riff-flogging and take a few steps up the
    evolutionary ladder for <i>Oddeyesee</i> are indisputable, and more than welcome.  Jane Goodall would be
    proud.</p></div>"|217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/217-oddeyesee/|8.6|Eric Carr

Barlow.  No,
    that's too easy; let's call him Lou B.  Anyway, Lou wanted to make music more
    than anything else in the world, so one day, he found a few other like-minded
    individuals and they formed a band known as Sebadoh.  They wrote songs about
    girls and weed, and they played them for people.  And so it came to pass on
    that fateful day that one of the founding forces of lo-fi indie rock was born,
    and a small section of the music world would be changed for the better, forever.</p><p>
    
    But Lou B. was not entirely happy with the musical genius of Sebadoh, and
    decided that he needed a more personal outlet for his musical demons-- one
    free of the evils of excess instrumentation.  So he stripped his songs to their
    barest, most vulnerable elements and exposed them for all to see.  He released
    these brave new songs under the guise of Sentridoh, and, well, not too many
    people noticed.</p><p>
<em>Free Sentridoh: Tales from Loobiecore</em> is the latest incarnation of Lou
    Barlow's work as Sentridoh, and I wish I could say that this little fairy tale
    has a happy ending.  I really do.  Unfortunately, <em>Tales from Loobiecore</em>
    doesn't deviate from the formula he established on the first two Sentridoh
    releases, only even less inspired and just plain bland most of the time.  As
    before, the recording quality is as lo-fi as it gets, and each one of the
    twenty-three tracks features Lou on his guitar with only an occasional assist
    on backing vocals or music.  Half the tracks sound the same, right down to the
    chord structure.  And while no single track is terrible on its own, there's no
    reason that these should all find their way onto one album-- because together,
    they're almost totally ignorable.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, the tone of the songs is distinctly personal, even at their
    most bizarre, on tracks like ""Spacescape Imagination Station.""  Barlow comes
    across as earnestly and sorrowfully as he always has, which is the one thing
    that holds the album together at all.  When the album works, it's due to a
    complete lack of pretense.  But there is a tradeoff.  Although never a problem
    with his work in Sebadoh and Folk Implosion, the trademark sincerity of these
    tunes comes at the expense of this album's vitality.  Most of the songs just
    fizzle out after two minutes or so, leaving very little impression as they pass.
    On the few occasions when <em>Tales from Loobiecore</em> does start to show signs
    of life, like ""The Devil and the Barbie Doll"" or ""Impulse,"" Barlow's vocals
    quickly snuff it.  With a band behind him, he can pull off his less-than-energetic
    delivery, but here his voice is fully half of every song; when the music
    actually picks up, Lou's vocals just aren't up to task.</p><p>
    
    Still, for its misfires, the record isn't a complete wash-out-- Barlow's
    songwriting ability is too solid to go 0-for-23.  In fact, some truly fantastic
    songs can be found here, especially in comparison with the other mostly
    forgettable tunes. ""WWJD?"" is one case when the direct, honest approach of the
    album works to beautiful effect, and the confessional aspect of Lou's writing
    is exemplified in the surprisingly touching ""None of Your Goddambizness.""
    ""Ride a Hearse, Build a Throne"" can go toe-to-toe with some of the best stuff
    he's ever done, period.  Sadly, though, the great songs are in the minority,
    and easily lost among the rest of the set.</p><p>
<em>Tales from Loobiecore</em> feels almost uncomfortably poignant considering
    Interscope's recent decision to drop the Folk Implosion, too.  Maybe Lou's
    depressed (more than usual, I mean)?  ""I let Methamphetamine burn a hole in my
    brain/  The part of my brain that wrote the songs/ When all of my confidence
    had jumped the fence and moved along,"" he sings on the eerily Don MacLean-esque
    ""Don't Call Me Writer.""  Whether or not it was his intent, I feel kind of bad
    for the guy.  Hopefully, his new post-Folk Implosion project will cheer him up,
    but until then, we all have Sentridoh to deal with. The music can grow on you,
    but ultimately there isn't much to redeem <em>Tales from Loobiecore</em>.  It
    slips into a coma before the five-minute mark, and though it shows promise here
    and there, even a die-hard Lou Barlow fan might consider pulling the plug.</p></div>"|7071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7071-free-sentridoh-tales-from-loobiecore/|5.5|Eric Carr

    Guapo.  Now, I'm not sure if this is an ambitious advertising campaign for the band (seeing as they also
    hail from the city of circling helicopters, anti-aircraft batteries, and Gulf War vet snipers), or the
    inspiration behind the name.  But no matter what you think of El Guapo, it's a better name than the other
    graffiti on that same wall: BONER.</p><p>
    
    These guys have been together since 1996, initially releasing their crazy art-punk through such microindies
    as Mud Memory, Red Skies at Night and Resin.  But don't be fooled by the Dischord label their records have
    sported since last year's <i>Super/System</i>-- this is hardly the Fugazi-derived post-punk fare the label
    built its name on, and is only tenuously related to the dancepunk the company's been peddling of late.  No,
    El Guapo strikes out for more experimental territory, full of quirky chanting and uneasy arrangements.
    Let's say it's like Le Tigre, only non-aggressive, less conventional, un-female, and apolitical-- does that
    leave anything?</p><p>
    
    One thing that's clear is that El Guapo sure loves themselves some vocal interplay, that being the element
    most central to all 12 songs on <i>Fake French</i>.  Sounding a little bit like the inspiring story of three
    guys who always dreamed of a career in cheerleading, the group tries out all styles of group singing: call
    and response (""The Time: Night""), ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" rounds (""Space Tourist""), ""Transylvania 6-5000""-style
    big band shoutouts (""Ocean and Sky"").  And despite that reference-packed rundown, it adds up to an original
    sound when set against the nervous compubeats, samples, and occasional accordion freakout of the backdrop.
    It even makes for above-average robot-dance music on the opener, ""Glass House"".</p><p>
    
    After that, it drives me up the fucking wall.  Seriously, ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" as a touchpoint?  Who wouldn't
    need a couple Excedrin after that?  The often cyclical and trance-repetitive nature of the vocals plays slowdown
    with the clock, making the typically two or three minute songs drag on for what seems like double that, the
    lean 35:00 of the album feeling like a triple LP .  When the backing music is in tip-top shape (the
    concise-Tortoise of the title track) the vocals are a distraction; when the orchestration is of a minimal
    nature (""Hawks, ""Hollywood Crew"") the campfire-singing is torturous.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, for an album permanently brandishing a big red EXPERIMENTAL stamp, <i>Fake French</i> only
    reaches its highest points with the relatively straightforward, timely tracks that clash a little bit of
    the electro: ""Just Don't Know"" and ""Underground"".  The rest of the album is chock-full of music that sounds
    largely original and hardly enjoyable.  So despite our shared city roots, and the fact that they'll probably
    beat me up next time I attend a Ft. Reno show, and my hunch that the title track is about the EPCOT Center
    (are they saying ""laser lights beyond the pocky ball?"" It's gotta be, right?), I'm gonna have to take a pass
    on El Guapo and <i>Fake French</i>.  Stick to graffiti, boys.</p></div>"|2711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2711-fake-french/|4.5|Rob Mitchum

    game?  In the rock and roll milieu, someone like David Bowie can adopt a different persona with each record
    he drops, and not only get away with it, but have it increase his marketability.  With hip-hop, though,
    conventional wisdom is to stick with the tried-and-true as long as it moves units, then get the hell out.
    Think about it: Run-D.M.C.'s <em>Back from Hell</em> was based upon the premise that they went underground
    and re-emerged as hardened thugs, a ploy that got hip-hop's equivalent of the three wise men nearly laughed
    out of the kingdom.  Meanwhile, others that have had drops in the bucket of post-revisionist success either
    possessed suspect credibility in the first place (can I get an Everlast?) or just changed the punchline to
    what was already a bad joke (that's you, Kid Rock).</p><p>
    Upon first glance, it appeared Common may have achieved that kind of transformation with his follow-up to
    <em>Like Water for Chocolate</em>.  From the <em>Sgt. Common's Lonely Peeps Club Band</em> cover art to an
    8\xBD-minute ode to Jimi Hendrix, <em>Electric Circus</em> resonates with a lava lamp glow that's a lot more
    hip-pie than hip-hop.  But that's Com's idea of where hip-hop should be headed-- to a land far, far away
    from the bling-blingity of his mainstream peers; if only his record hadn't been released so close to The
    Roots' <em>Phrenology</em> (note to MCA management: fire the person responsible for that little ""oversight""),
    Common's three steps backward might not pale so harshly in comparison to his peers' two steps forward.</p><p>
    The most difficult sword to swallow in this particular circus is the near-absence of noteworthy vocals.
    Though Common's never exactly been a top-shelf emcee, his previous records always had enough good ideas to
    cover up what he lacked in invention on the mic. This time out, Com comes off as alternately uncomfortable
    and downright lazy, half-speaking-- or worse, <i>singing</i>-- new-age revelations to the masses.  Even on
    a crunk-ass Neptunes track like ""I Got a Right Ta"", he plods along with an awkward flow only to boast, ""I'm
    the only cat in hip-hop/ That can go to a thrift shop/ Bring that get-up to the ghetto/ And get props,"" as
    if it's something to be proud of. But for better or worse, he still delivers some vintage Common flow on ""I
    Am Music"" and the equally imposing (and nonsensical) ""Electric Wire Hustle Flower"", making it impossible to
    write him off completely.</p><p>
    Common's also always had a soft side, which has more often than not stood up in defense of his tendencies
    toward lyrical misogyny.  Unfortunately, returning to that comfort zone on <em>Electric Circus</em> translates
    into some of the record's weakest moments.  If ""Star *69 (PS With Love)""-- a totally predictable phone-sex
    love song that reeks of cheap incense and leopard-print upholstery-- isn't example enough, Com's smarmy duet
    with Mary J. Blige on ""Come Close"" should be sufficient.  With a line like, ""The pimp in me may just have to
    die with you,"" Com invalidates any claims he might have to renaissance man status in a mere eleven syllables.</p><p>
    Yet there's one crucial element to <em>Electric Circus</em> that salvages it from the razor-sharp ends of our
    three-pronged fork: listening to it on headphones is another experience altogether.  The record has a mellow
    tide to it much like that of <em>Like Water for Chocolate</em>, with brief musical interludes that fuse even
    the sharpest stylistic changes together nicely. It all builds up like a slow fever to the two marathon-length
    tracks that dismantle the big top-- ""Jimi Was a Rock Star"" and ""Heaven Somewhere""-- both of which are
    laudable for their ambition, even if they're not quite cohesive.</p><p>
    If nothing else, Common does at least succeed in his mission to offer an alternative in a culture that, on
    the surface, values material wealth over spiritual well-being.  Because even if <i>Electric Circus</i> isn't
    the sonic <em>coup  d'etat</em> he might've intended, it does plant the seeds for future revolution within
    anyone who cares enough to kick back and listen.</p></div>"|1565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1565-electric-circus/|6.5|Scott Hreha

    have shot him.  When <i>Dirty</i> first came out, it was an almost universal disappointment to anyone who'd
    listened to Sonic Youth beyond <em>Goo</em>-- and amidst the cries bemoaning what a major-label contract had
    done to their music, it wasn't as clear then that, beneath the glossy sheen Butch Vig and Andy Wallace had
    inflicted upon their beloved chaos, there was a damn good record waiting to be heard.  Sure, it won them the
    seeds of a new fanbase-- though the majority had probably been re-alienated by the time they got around to
    <em>Washing Machine</em>-- but back then, it felt like a slap in the face from David Geffen himself.</p><p>
    Listening to the instrumental B-sides and rehearsal takes that make up the second disc of this deluxe
    reissue, though, the final <em>Dirty</em> product makes a lot more sense.  Even if they're mostly meandering
    jams with cells of future songs congealing here and there, these tracks show how the big-league production
    simply smoothed out the frayed edges of the group's sound.  Of course, the noisier parts of songs like
    ""On the Strip"" still feel more calculated than the ecstatic beauty that seemed to organically materialize
    in the past, but the record really isn't anything worse than the band beginning to play with some of the
    toys they suddenly had at their disposal.</p><p>
    But is the second disc worth more than a cursory listen?  Not really, at least beyond the covers.  Hearing
    Kim Gordon grunt her way through Alice Cooper's ""Is It My Body"" or flatly drone above the acoustic shambles
    of the New York Dolls' ""Personality Crisis"" is a pleasure to which I'll gladly return, but once the insight
    is absorbed from blueprints of ""Wish Fulfillment"", ""Youth Against Fascism"" and ""Drunken Butterfly"", among
    others, they don't make for the most compelling of repeat visits.</p><p>
    It's also worth re-examining the subject matter of these songs because, as Byron Coley points out in the
    liner notes, <i>Dirty</i> marked the first record where Thurston, Lee and Kim made direct statements with
    their lyrics instead of using a Beat-like detachment to throw smoke clouds over their true targets. Where
    lyrical content in the past had dealt with surreal portraits of unlikely pop icons or had offered subverted
    political commentary like ""Total Trash"", <i>Dirty</i> had them throwing pointed barbs like ""Youth Against
    Fascism"" or offering elegiac tributes to murdered friends (""100%"" and ""JC"")-- not to mention that Kim's
    prior feminist manifestos had never been so bitingly succinct as they are on ""Swimsuit Issue"" and ""Shoot"".</p><p>
    Even among the less confrontational tracks, there are still so many more great songs on <em>Dirty</em> than
    a lot of people ever realized.  ""Theresa's Sound World"" fuses some of the better guitar interplay of
    <em>Daydream Nation</em> and <em>Goo</em> into a concise proclamation, while ""Sugar Kane"" and ""Purr"" are pure
    pop songs dressed up with a thousand pounds of overdrive; even a near throwaway like ""Crème Brulee"" is
    salvaged by Kim's sultry delivery.  The four B-sides that accompany the original tracks on the first disc
    are enormous finds, too-- especially the LP bonus track ""Stalker"" that shows how only Sonic Youth could
    conjure the Sex Pistols covering Lynyrd Skynyrd.  They might be a little rougher around the edges, but each
    of these tracks is as good as anything that made it onto <em>Dirty</em> proper.</p><p>
    The only thing that really stands out as worthy of true criticism now is the tendency toward mining and
    repackaging some of the older material that becomes visible through the cracks of this reissue.  ""Orange
    Rolls, Angels Spit"" recycles the riff from ""Stereo Sanctity"" into a grungy vehicle for Kim's angst, while
    ""Shoot"" fails to look any farther back than ""Kool Thing"", slowing the trendy alterna-hit down to an
    unsettling dirge about a woman ready to gun her way out from under some asshole's thumb.  Several other
    tracks have that familiar vibe to them without borrowing outright from previous songs, showing that even
    if they weren't entirely catering to the new ears Nirvana's success was sending their way, they were at
    least taking it into consideration on a semi-conscious level.</p><p>
    Of course, we should be clear about one thing: there's no chance of <i>Dirty</i> usurping <em>Evol</em>,
    <em>Sister</em> or <em>Daydream Nation</em> on my list of favorite Sonic Youth records, and even this 180-degree
    change of heart won't make me apologize for all the shit I've talked about it over the years.   Still, even
    if there's a distinct possibility that I'm in the minority of <em>Dirty</em>-haters who'll eventually come
    around, this package at least makes a good case for reassessment.  But if I'm talking like this when the
    expanded remaster of <em>Experimental Jet Set, Trash &amp; No Star</em> comes around, just do me a favor and put
    me out of my misery.</p></div>"|7345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7345-dirty-deluxe-edition/|8.6|Scott Hreha

I know he's a badass in the kitchen, working in one of New York's
    finest restaurants for years now, yet I never get to see him in action behind the swinging doors, over the
    open flames and hissing steam. The precision with which he handles the knife is incredible, his knuckles
    and manual movements the very economy of action, each cut vegetable chopped meticulously. Everything, be
    it ginger, onion, peppers, or tomato, is reduced into miniscule 1/16th-inch cubes.  ""Why so small?"", I ask.
    ""The more finely chopped,"" he says, ""the better the flavor.""  Technique aside, the resulting din-din is on
    a plane above how I imagined food could taste.</p><p>
    I didn't really make the connection between fine cuisine and the music of Phill Niblock until thumbing
    through the thick ten-page booklet of Indonesian images that accompanies his latest set: bushels of harvest,
    rice patties, kitchen prep, and oxen carcasses being carved up rib by rib.</p><p>
    The working methods of this minimalist composer are strikingly unique.  At first it's tough to tell, since,
    for years, his recorded discography had large gaps, due to the limitations of the vinyl medium.  The advent
    of the CD, however, allowed him greater frequency ranges and longer durations of uninterrupted time to cast
    his sounds in-- and the arrival of ProTools technology must have seemed an invention of Ron Popiel proportions,
    aiding him in easily amassing and processing his sounds.  So while peers such as La Monte Young, Eliane
    Radigue, or Tony Conrad might have taken years or decades to bear forth variations on their initial 60s
    explorations, Niblock is feverishly cranking these days, his sounds mutating as he goes. The last few years
    have brought forth pieces for hurdy-gurdy and voice, as well as one for guitars featuring Thurston Moore,
    Kevin Drumm, and Jim O'Rourke.</p><p>
    That said, it's hard to tell some of his pieces apart. Once instruments like the French horn, didjeridoo,
    sousaphone, hurdy-gurdy, and guitar are singularly smeared into 25-minutes cloud chunks, you could be
    anywhere. Here, the saxophone of the first piece, the bass clarinet of the second, and electric bass of the
    third are cooked down to their vibrating essence, and then heated in Niblock's cauldron as an entirely new
    thing. Alchemical or purely from the open flame, the once-acoustic instruments are altered to sound
    otherworldly, to the great duress of your woofers; as the low fluctuations coagulate and gain amplitude,
    cranking up the volume (as Niblock always suggests) lets the sounds beat across every pore and surface of
    the body, massaging the constrictions of the earspace away.</p><p>
    The second disc holds ""Pan Fried"", a 70-minute bit of nervous system suspension that's easily Phill's
    grandest bit of glacial bliss yet, stretched out to commemorate his 70th year. Taking Reinhold Friedl's
    rosined fingertips as they rub a string tied to a single piano wire inside of a Bosendorfer piano (the
    piano of choice for heavenly hum by folks like La Monte Young and Charlemagne Palestine), several octaves
    of C# and F are recorded, then pureed. Between those two little notes, Niblock carves out a canyon that
    somehow has the basso profundo of the Million Man Choir, the slow grinding of plate tectonic pop, the
    30-story high cicada song of spring, and the plinks of the Lord's own zither all freefalling through the
    space. That each droning sound dissolves into a heavenly consommé is one thing, but that the consummate
    effect is of you ""soaking in it"" makes it one of the more singular taste sensations of the year.</p></div>"|5788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5788-touch-food/|8.0|Andy Beta

    loose about throwing these terms around in hopes of snagging a few stray dollars from consumers who don't

<i>Essential</i> is the title that gives me the most pause, though, considering how vaguely the term is used.

    to be more absolute, meaning ""here's the essential stuff-- buy it and you're set.""  By the first standard,
    this latest in a string of dozens of Byrds retrospectives is mostly a success; by the second standard, it's
    a complete failure.</p><p>
    
    Nearly every song on this two-disc set warrants inclusion on some basis, though disc two is somewhat weighted
    down by Columbia's insistence on including at least two tracks from every one of the band's albums for the
    label, including the hideously overproduced <i>Byrdmaniax</i> and the scattered <i>Farther Along</i>, the
    albums which precipitated the band's ultimate collapse.  The band's final albums, to put it lightly, are
    for hardcore fans of the band's second, more country-inspired phase, and not territory for curiosity-seekers
    to be wandering onto.  When you consider this set as a whole, that loss of momentum is especially problematic,
    as it leaves you with the aftertaste of the songs most lacking in luster.  Perhaps a better title would have
    been <i>Overview</i>, or at least <i>Anthology</i>.</p><p>
    
    Really, I could sit here and complain for paragraphs about the fact that they missed ""You're Still on my Mind"",
    ""I Know My Rider"", ""One Hundred Years from Now"", and ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"", among dozens of other
    fantastic songs hiding in the band's catalog.  But gripes aside, there's more than enough amazing material
    here to serve as proof that The Byrds were one of the greatest bands of their era.  The first disc doesn't
    slip at all-- bookended by the band's definitive versions of Dylan's ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and ""My Back Pages"",
    it's sixteen undeniable classics parked right next to each other; you can almost hear the roots of every band
    that ever jangled spreading the through the soil of rock.  In just three selections, this compilation makes
    the case for Gene Clark as a colossal songwriter, and his ""I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better"" and ""She Don't Care
    About Time"" are enough to make me wish he'd written a thousand more.</p><p>
    
    The band's exhilarating turn into psychedelia, ""Eight Miles High"", still sounds just as towering today as it
    must have back then, standing next to The Who's ""I Can See for Miles"" as rock's best early flirtation with
    open-ended improvisation within an otherwise conventional song form.  Roger McGuinn's stunning twelve-string
    solos echo the exploratory sax of Coleman and Coltrane and blow the doors off anything else I can think of
    that was happening in mainstream rock in 1966.  The goofy pop of ""Mr. Spaceman"" and ""So You Want to be a Rock
    'n' Roll Star"" is excellent, though the songs sound a little slight in comparison to bassist Chris Hillman's
    gloriously Beatlesque ""Have You Seen Her Face"" and the dark, beguiling Crosby/McGuinn tune ""Renaissance Fair"".</p><p>
    
    The second disc kicks off with perhaps the most inspired, unexpected choice on the set, the fantastic
    Crosby-penned single ""Lady Friend"", a tune that truly warrants the ""essential"" label, even if the band never
    saw fit to put it on an album.  But from there, things get a bit less even, as the band became more erratic
    with each lineup shift that followed Crosby's departure.  Certainly, their first post-Crosby album, <i>The
    Notorious Byrd Brothers</i>, was every bit as good as their earlier records, highlighted by a pair of
    Goffin/King covers (""Goin' Back"" and ""Wasn't Born to Follow"", both included here) that marked a flirtation
    with Spector-ish Wall of Sound sonics.</p><p>
    
    The following year, the arrival of Gram Parsons in the band's ranks sparked a shift into country that lingered
    even after his departure to found The Flying Burrito Brothers with Hillman.  Opinions vary widely on the
    direction the band took following the dissolution of the original lineup, but it's hard to deny that
    <i>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</i> is one of the best country albums ever recorded, which is why it's curious
    that only two songs from it show up here.  Parsons' ""Hickory Wind"" and their cover of Dylan's ""You Ain't
    Goin' Nowhere"" are estimable songs, but it's a meager offering from such a rich album-- at the very least,
    ""One Hundred Years from Now"" should have made the cut.</p><p>
    
    The stinginess of the <i>Sweetheart</i> offerings would be forgivable if there was much that followed that
    feels right taking its place.  As it happens, ""Ballad of Easy Rider"" is the band's best late-period song,
    but... ""Jesus Is Just Alright""?  Their version is okay, but-- and how often can you say this?-- The Doobie
    Brothers did it better.   Otherwise, ""Chestnut Mare"" (from 1970's <i>Untitled</i>) is fun, and ""Tiffany
    Queen"" (from their 1971 swan song <i>Farther Along</i>) is a fine last gasp, but in the harsh light of what's
    come before it, it can't help but sound slightly dull.</p><p>
    
    I don't know that I can recommend against picking up this set, but I'd say that if you can do it, buying the
    remastered, augmented versions of the band's first six albums is a much better investment.  The Byrds were
    hugely important for all kinds of reasons, from their simultaneous embrace of folk and electric instruments,
    to their psychedelic experimentalism, to their mastery of country-rock, and a good sampling of the songs
    that made them important is available here.  Whether or not it makes it to your shelf depends mostly on your
    appetite for The Byrds-- if one release is all you're ever going to get, this one would be hard to beat.</p></div>"|1058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1058-the-essential-byrds/|8.4|Joe Tangari

    stuffed in the cramped basement listening to three bands play in just as many hours.  Upon raising the
    bottle to her face for one more swig before returning to the floor, she felt a tap on her shoulder and a
    chorus of voices ask her, ""Excuse me, is this seat taken?""</p><p>
    Stefani turned her head, and saw behind her the entire group that had just finished their set, The Chromatics.
    ""Uhm,"" she hesitantly replied, ""no, it's not, go ahead.""</p><p>
    ""Excellent.  We're really thirsty after that show.  Would you like something to drink as well?"" the band
    asked.  A long silence ensued while the bartender fetched four beers for the group.</p><p>
    ""Right... can I ask why you all are wearing an oversized sweater with four neck-holes cut into it?  And why
    are you speaking in unison and wearing those duct-tape anklets?""</p><p>
    ""Our psychiatrist says we need to focus on building our team skills,"" said the band. ""She says it will help
    us salve our artistic wounds.""</p><p>
    Stefani rolled her eyes.  That's all she needed was to get hit on by yet another creatively divided band.
    She shuddered as she remembered her sordid affair with Wilco the previous year.</p><p>
<center>-- STRIKE ONE --</center></p><p>
    ""SO,"" the Chromatics said, ""those are nice, exaggerated cuff dark-denim jeans you have there.""  They paused
    for effect before adding, ""They'd look better on my van floor, though.""</p><p>
    ""UGH, are you serious?!""  Stefani had to set her drink down. ""Is that your opening line?  Aside from being
    completely crass and inappropriate, it's as old as my dad!""</p><p>
    ""We take pride in vulgar displays of animal lust, though,"" the band argued, ""and we think there's nothing
    wrong with borrowing from the past.""</p><p>
    ""That's an understatement.  I heard your new album, <i>Chrome Rats vs Basement Rutz</i>, and it's raw to
    say the least.  It sounds like The Godz after 24-hour exposure to Gang of Four, The Stooges circa <i>Raw
    Power</i>, and The Fall.""</p><p>
    ""Yeah, we feel that the tracks wear their influences like badges of honor,"" the group said before elaborating,
    ""We trade the catcalls and the angular honky-tonk guitar of The Fall on 'Skill Fall', drag the burden of
    feedback akin to Sonic Youth on 'Plastic Kross', and finally utilize American dissidence with the copped
    Wipers tune 'Felt Tongue'.""</p><p>
    Stefani perked up, ""Isn't that one of the tracks that The Blood Brothers' Johnny Vade co-vocals?  I've had
    my eye on him ever since the popular press started to notice the band.  Where is he?""</p><p>
    ""Oh, well, you see,"" the band scratched their collective heads. ""He, uh, doesn't return our phone calls now.""</p><p>
<center>-- STRIKE TWO --</center></p><p>
    Stefani tried to think of something to say to break the awkward silence.  She finally declared, ""I appreciate
    the tangential no wave-inspired support of sexual equality that you all attempt, allowing the girls to share
    equivalent stage-time with the boys, especially on tracks like 'Hannah's Song'.  It boasts the closest connection
    on the album to my favorite influential groups like Ut, Y Pants, and The Raincoats, though I don't understand
    why you couldn't do more with the sound and content, steering away from the clichés of grrl-rock.""</p><p>
    ""Our effort was really on the lyrics in those songs, though, focusing the experimental energy into lines
    like, 'We pose a threat to undermine your dominance,' and, 'You ought to stick it in and show me what a man
    can do,' and leaving the song structure at a really basic style...""</p><p>
    ""I was curious as to why you only allowed the girls to shine in a stereotyped Kim Gordon-growl.  Don't you
    worry that lyrics like that will peg the songs as second-generation Bikini Kill fodder?  And why should the
    woman's role be defined by sexual views while the men get to opine and politick about everything from
    government policy to music history?  The more I think about it, the more the songs sound like loosely
    tacked-on gender-specific apologies that work only to get the band laid.""</p><p>
    The band stared blankly into their drinks before raising their heads with a wide-eyed grin and asking, ""Is
    it working?""</p><p>
<center>-- STRIKE THREE --</center></p><p>
    Stefani picked up her button-covered messenger's bag and made her way back to the stage.  She never saw the
    band again, but she heard that they followed the No New York personalities' trend of imploding before the
    official release of any substantial body of work, leaving behind only remnant members and a slew of other
    NY bands to carry the torch of arty and ambiguous musicianship into the future.  She thought to herself how
    sad it was that if they'd only been given the benefit of time the band could have eventually surpassed their
    dependence on immaturity and hindsight, and ultimately not have fallen prey to both her rejection and their
    own.  Though she moved on with her life-- currently dating the Yeah Yeah Yeahs-- Stefani never forgot that
    magical moment she shared with a band that burned out just when they were getting interesting.</p></div>"|1456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1456-chrome-rats-vs-basement-rutz/|6.0|Andrew Bryant

    the world. Impressive. They displaced Deep Purple. I think Manowar might have it now. To be honest, I was
    never much taken by such shows of largess: all it meant was they could afford big amps. I got to thinking
    in terms of world records, though, while listening to <i>Ride Paranoia</i>, the second full-length by Oslo's
    JR Ewing. For its 34 minutes, vocalist Andreas Tylden screams at earsplitting levels, uncoiling insane
    vocalizations over Keith Moon drum theatrics so powerful, walls start to buckle and bend. With the right
    management Tylden could win decibel-blasting contests, take gold to Norway, display the shiny shit besides
    a couple of Happy Tom's stained sailor caps in Oslo's imaginary rock 'n' roll hall of fame.</p><p>
    
    Since 1998, JR Ewing's caustically winded approach has been on the verge of breaking something: imagine
    drenched and heaving bodies caved-in from exertion, how eels supposedly implode after traveling hundreds of
    miles to spawn in the Sargasso Sea. Sonically, the purest comparison is Drive Like Jehu, or the louder
    factions of the Gravity Records roster-- maybe Clikatat Ikatowi. It'd seem Oslo's but a few miles north of
    San Diego.</p><p>
<i>Ride Paranoia</i> opens with a loose, sputtering guitar cable trying to establish a flow of electricity,
    which shifts into the manic drum roll, fill and sliced guitars of the fairly pitch-perfect ""Repetition Is
    Failure"". Within its onslaught, Tylden's backdrop pauses momentarily to make way for his shout of, ""Stop
    cutting the hair and start living for a change,"" after which the album-- doing speed-freak one-armed pushups--
    happily avoids calming down or even taking much of a breather. Some songs might rely too much on dynamics to
    propel-- never focusing on much beyond their composition-- and as is often the case with rock of this sort,
    a few songs suffer from sameness. ""Naked Pavements"" is akin to an overlong Jawbreaker exercise where Blake
    pointlessly incorporates movie samples and spoken lyrics. The band's best at short blasts: the histrionics
    are already epic in scope by just existing so there's no need to drag them out with Unwound-like incidental
    jams. Usually, though, the sheer momentum of the playing overcomes (or rebounds from) such missteps.</p><p>
    
    ""When You're Gone"" is the bottled energy of Behead the Prophet and The Locust, but waxing emotional and sappy.
    Hey, even the frantic get the blues, right?  Despite the song's cheesy lyrical turns (""crimson flames running
    through my heart""), I dig Tylden's sap: his purple prose matches his determined delivery. ""Pre Summertime
    Blues"", for example, is equally spaz-core potent, but redeems the crimson flames line with: ""A comma counter
    just shot himself/ A sawdust trail leading nowhere."" Nice: the textual conjoining with the corporeal. In ""A
    Case of Evacuation"" Tylden goes on about how ""being broke is probably the best luxury.""  The vocal line
    offers a few ""My Generation"" stutters and over-enunciations, reminiscent of Nation of Ulysses, torn suits
    and all. I ultimately prefer these Lou Reed-ish sick city poverty themes (""a sweet syringe lost in a haystack"")
    to the tales of woe-begotten broken hearts, no matter the curative powers of a song's dynamics. A cracked
    city is filled with human relationships, things broken (and broken things) on a larger scale.</p><p>
<i>Ride Paranoia</i>'s cover depicts abandoned, placed-just-so instruments and amplifiers: the detritus of
    staged rock excess. Nothing actually looks destroyed, and instead of reading this as a contrivance, I saw
    it as a reality: some folks just can't afford to break their shit. So you choose your damage. Catharsis is
    achieved, the metaphor for rock 'n' roll energy is deposited, and you can use your wounded gear the day
    after next. <i>Ride Paranoia</i> is this intelligent obliteration.</p></div>"|4309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4309-ride-paranoia/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    Prince Paul was the greatest producer of all time, ever.  I had a crush on him.  The track record?
    Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this: three absolute masterpieces for De La Soul, Stetsasonic,
    Gravediggaz, Handsome Boy Modeling School, Psychoanalysis (<i>What Is It?</i>), <i>A Prince Among Thieves</i>,
    etc.  Here's a man with the guts to push sampling boundaries to their limits, creating broad, sonically
    cluttered terrain that remain tidy enough to still be logically rapped over, and not to mention being
    hip-hop's re-inventor of the ""skit.""</p><p>
    Despite ample success over nearly two decades, attempts are never
    made by others to emulate his sound; Prince Paul is constantly groundbreaking, and being the pioneer that
    he is, that shouldn't sound clichéd.  Now, after severing ties with Tommy Boy, it's nice to see that the
    guts are still intact, and this time his audacity and valor are being used to... create a terrible album,
    on purpose!  Like intentionally missing a free-throw to score an offensive tip-in for the win, Dew Doo Man
    fans are left scratching their heads, thinking, ""just how is this gonna work?""</p><p>
    Obviously no stranger to the concept album, Paul's meta-flavor this time around is to be, well, mediocre.
    Citing the liner notes, he lays out his feelings towards the state of the industry today: ""Hip-hop has
    remained stagnant... the level of greed has intensified.  It's not about the music as much as what surrounds
    the music ($).""  That one gets an ""amen"" and a ""duh"" from me, as I'd like to think everyone reading this
    essentially regards that as a given.  At least, though, a prominent face in hip-hop has taken an ""I'll be
    damned"" attitude if he doesn't do something about it.  ""Record sales are like votes, it all counts,"" he
    states.  ""Your purchases have the power to change the course of the music being made and sold.""  Romanticizing
    aside, Paul still feels ""a good portion of people probably won't go beyond the surface of this album or care
    enough to even get the meaning or irony of this project.""  After digging through every inch of it, I
    certainly have a grasp of what's being attempted; however, one can't help but think this thing was doomed
    from the start.</p><p>
    The story begins with Paul (as himself) in a meeting.  After going ""double wood"" with the first attempt,
    record exec Dave Chappelle demands a new album that will sell.  The result is <i>Politics of the Business</i>,
    a record designed strictly for commercial success.  Thus, the barbs the ""real"" Prince Paul is hurling at
    the music-machine are themselves what the industry is made of.  These are the most insipid and undemanding
    creations he has ever come up with.  It's difficult to approach an album like this without plodding into an
    indie/commercial discussion, but I'll try to let it be with just saying these songs would fit right in on
    some Hott-Baby-Boy-Urban-Traffic-Jam-Hour-Dude corporate radio show.  In short, this is generic, blandly
    accessible hip-hop that goes absolutely nowhere.</p><p>
    Trust me, if this review was rewarding whether or not Prince Paul achieved his goal, I'd crown him with a
    shiny 10-zillion.0 rating.  Unfortunately, the concept just won't fly.  Is this really the appropriate way
    to address the status of a genre that's on life support, or perhaps better yet, revive one that's already
    beyond the grave?  The album is devoid of anything musically noteworthy.  The synth horns of ""Not Tryin' to
    Hear That"" bash a hole into your skull; ""So What"" has a twangy organ line that's nauseatingly boring.  The
    drum tracks in <i>every song</i> sound like they took ten seconds to program.  One exception could be the
    acoustic neo-soul of ""Beautifully Absurd"", featuring poet-man W. Ellington Felton, but those drums are by
    far the only thing worth mentioning.  Yes, I know production like this is the whole point, but what do you
    want from me?  It sucks.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, emcee contribution helps in name only.  Some of hip-hop's most intimidating make appearances
    accurately showing industry dissatisfaction, including Chuck D, Ice-T, and the gravelly voice of DJ Premier,
    though only by way of brief skits.  Verses from Guru, Trugoy, Planet Asia, Eric Sermon, and Masta Ace (to
    name a few) fit right in with the ""accessibility"" the record should contain, but that just means being dull.
    To quote Kardinal Offishall's chorus on ""What I Need"": ""We keep it hot when we up in the spot/ Every time
    when we on the grind/ Make it happen when you calling the shots/ Do you and I'm a do you mine.""  Now that's
    effectively not saying nothing.</p><p>
    Cynics that pass off the release as Prince Paul's last gasp, however, are missing the point.  Honestly, the
    concept as a whole is clever, and I'm legitimately shocked that he would craft such an outing.  He really
    pulls off a current (albeit boring) sound I didn't think he had in him.  Musical evidence to prove his
    future hasn't been shaken for good-- aside from ""Chubb Rock Can You Please Pay Paul the $2200 You Owe Him
    (People, Places and Things)"", which only works due to the reuse of De La's ""Pease Porridge""-- is the album's
    final tune.  After the proper sham ends, Paul tacks on ""The Way My Life Seems"", an elegantly dreary
    half-Pharcyde reunion with Tre and Fat Lip.  The guitar splashes and thick bass aren't far removed from
    Dre circa '91.</p><p>
    It must be reiterated that I know full well what Prince Paul is doing on <i>Politics of the Business</i>,
    but he's fighting fire with fire.  His arm's too short to box with the industry gods.  He set out to make a
    mediocre album, and succeeded admirably.  Doing the unexpected, just as we've come to expect, at least one
    thing remains: Prince Paul is still my favorite producer.</p></div>"|6482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6482-politics-of-the-business/|5.1|Matt Kallman

I'm not talking
    about the quality of his music (though he's hitting his stride, and <i>Up in
    Flames</i> is definitely among the year's best), but his editing and sequencing
    skills. True to its 60s influences, <i>Up in Flames</i> is a tight and tidy
    40-minute record, the kind that's so short and consistently good you can't
    help but wonder about the quality of the tracks that didn't make the cut.
    Because Snaith knows what he's doing, we can assume that some of the better
    also-rans would find release somewhere. This EP, in addition to containing
    one of the highlights from <i>Up in Flames</i>, contains three such tracks.</p><p>
    But first there is ""Jacknuggeted"" itself, taken from the album.  The simple
    acoustic guitar hook on the chorus is the first thing that sticks out. It's
    a jubilant, three-chord strum that sounds like something you might play a
    couple hours into your first time picking up the instrument, during that
    moment when you finally ""get"" how chords work together. It's got a virginal
    excitement to go with its archetypical pop structure, and the fact that Snaith
    backs it with an organ swell and a thicket of sitar-like sounds makes it even
    better. Handclaps, ba-ba vocals, a chopped, stutter-step break-- it's a lot
    to pack into 3\xBD minutes, but it works beautifully.</p><p>
    The first time I listened to ""Olé"" it sounded like Snaith had omitted his
    version of ""Let's Go Away for a While"" from his own personal <i>Pet Sounds</i>.
    ""Olé"" is certainly more upbeat and aggressive, but something about its
    meandering, tuneful structure punctuated by periodic drum rolls (these being
    much heavier) seems akin to Brian Wilson's light classic. ""Thistles and
    Felt"" hearkens back to the first Manitoba full-length's interest in the
    sounds associated with innocence. Music box bells provide the center around
    which sampled strings, guitar, keyboards and drums revolve. Very much like
    the best of <i>Up in Flames</i>, ""Thistles and Felt"" is a traditional pop
    instrumental constructed by someone with a background in electronic music.
    That is, instead of relying on long melody lines laid over chord changes,
    ""Thistles and Felt"" is about instrumental addition and subtraction, a series
    of sonic swells and contractions.</p><p>
    The six-minute ""Seaweed"" closes this brief EP. With its length and brooding
    intro, the track feels like it wants to be more substantial than the three
    tunes preceding it, but it's ultimately not as satisfying. A short glockenspiel
    melody is the focal point of the track, but somehow the hook isn't compelling
    enough to warrant the grandeur that surrounds it. Still, despite the ho-hum
    closer, <i>Jacknuggted</i> is still a smart little EP that shows Snaith had
    enough good material to pack <i>Up in Flames</i> completely if he was so
    inclined. His decision to include the B-sides on this EP instead elevates
    both records individually.</p></div>"|5079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5079-jacknuggeted-ep/|7.8|Mark Richardson

    bet a lot of you share that sentiment-- Whirlwind Heat are counting on it.  If it weren't for Jack White's
    perplexing cachet as crossover-darling-of-the-moment, I doubt anyone could've voodooed V2 into spewing forth
    <i>Do Rabbits Wonder?</i>.  In a just world, the dismal aggregation of Moog-funk chaos collected on the debut
    LP of White's fellow Michiganites couldn't see rotation in a trash heap, let alone airtime on M2 (I'll leave
    it on you to decide the degree of separation there).  But everyday, something-- be it venereal disease, or
    Republicans, or Nelly-- goes out of its way to prove once again that life ain't fair, and it ain't getting
    any fairer.  Consequently, as the debut signees for Jack's Third Man imprint, and with V2's backing, and if
    everyone takes leave of their senses long enough to buy just one more album... well, it's all too easy to
    see how Whirlwind Heat is poised as a Next Big Thing on the cusp of the burgeoning art-punk uprising.</p><p>
    
    It's mind-boggling that such sloppily arranged, barely listenable stuff is getting this kind of attention,
    but that's celebrity for you.  In fact, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, as part of their apparent ongoing crusade to
    devour the public's collective sensibilities from the inside-out, has called Whirlwind Heat this generation's
    Devo.  Did I miss some kind of election?  Forget for a moment that a <i>'Stone</i> endorsement seems more
    like sloppy seconds for anything that has the name ""Jack White"" stapled to it-- it's statements like this
    that cause brain hemorrhages.  Is this supposed to be a good thing?  To paraphrase Moses Hadas, the demise
    of Devo left a much-needed gap; even if painfully affected vocals, incompetent Moogery, and excruciating
    ""quirkiness"" are all it takes to fill that void, Whirlwind Heat are still nothing but an unfunny punchline
    to the joke Devo started back in '72.</p><p>
    
    But they can't even hope for that much; Devo at least had a brain.  Instead, Heat follows thoughtlessly in
    the footsteps of their betters on the dancepunk gravy train, piecing together similar fragments left in the
    ruinous wake of the post-punk/no wave aftermath.  Erratic, bass-dominated rock with an ear toward shaking
    your ass (sometimes), punctuated with a little electronic dissonance to complete the outfit-- everything's
    in its proper place, but somehow it goes horribly awry.  The Rapture, Giddy Motors, or the tragic brilliance
    of Brainiac-- the modern masters of the form know how to unveil cohesion, complexity, and even the odd melody
    out of apparent cacophony; meanwhile, David Swanson is so helpless with his keyboard I'm curious why he even
    bothers plugging it in.  He caterwauls away, stabbing keys on a whim, presumably counting on some magical
    melody fairy to come save him.  (She refuses.)</p><p>
    
    Worst of all-- I mean, aside from the extra-strength dumb of this record's koan-esque title-- Swanson's
    spasmodic Moog is the album's attempted ""hook.""  Oh my.  Along with his yelping falsetto, the two most
    notable elements of Whirlwind Heat do nothing but smash anything that resembles a song, or organization,
    or the happiness of the listener.  On ""Brown"" or ""Black"", Swanson is in a tolerable speak'n'sing mode, but
    can't go a full sentence without nastily spiking his voice into a range that shoots for ""tenor"" and hits
    ""what the fuck was that""; elsewhere, on cuts like ""Pink"", he never shuts up.  He warbles through lines as
    laughable as, ""Like a trash bag helmet,"" operating in some sort of alien pseudo-rhythm that's nine-times-out-of-ten
    totally oblivious to the rest of the song.  But, hey, y'know, it's quirky!  Yeah, quirky like a seizure.
    That, and the gimmicky electronic squalls (see ""Blue""), are damaging enough to turn even the most intriguing
    bass/drum dynamics into soup.</p><p>
    
    And that's no mean feat, either, since the carefully hidden strength of Whirlwind Heat is that they possess
    some of the filthiest, sleaziest basslines in town.  When Brad Holland uses his percussive powers for good
    (instead of making his kickdrum the object of random violence) and falls in sync with the amped-up raunch
    of Steve Damstra's fuzz bass, the two can lay down quite an onslaught.  Damstra's bass even pulls double-duty,
    carrying what little melody exists in the album in the absence of guitars.  But it doesn't make any difference;
    pointless fills and caught-in-a-bear-trap howling create an untenable schism between spine-cracking intensity
    and atonal mess.</p><p>
    
    If nothing else can be said in its favor, this is music that will instantly, violently polarize people: some
    folks' inner masochists may welcome it as an alternative to self-flagellation; personally, I'd rather take
    sandpaper across my corneas than sit through this thing again.  As Swanson ""sings"" on ""Orange"", ""This is a
    good day to die/ And this is a good day to whine/ And this is a good day to cry""; listen to Whirlwind Heat
    long enough, and I think you'll agree.</p></div>"|8642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8642-do-rabbits-wonder/|2.7|Eric Carr

The power of music to seemingly construct, alter and distort space can be staggering.  <em>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</em>, the second album from French electronic duo M83, nicely epitomizes this: The sound is absolutely huge, its relentless attention to detail eclipsed only by the stunning emotional power it conveys.  For fifty-seven glorious minutes, its impossibly intricate tapestry of buzzing techno synthesizers, distorted electric guitars, cheesy drum machines, and subdued vocals generate a sense of bodily movement through a landscape of beauty, disappointment, glory, and decrepitude.  <em>Dead Cities</em> not only envelops you, but also affords you room to explore its vast expanse.</p><p>  One remarkable attribute of <em>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</em> is how vastly M83's sound palette differs from the ones most often used to create music possessing this much beauty and depth.  Countless musicians have humanized electronic sounds by generating tones that feel warm or organic, but M83 have undertaken a different challenge: to convey beauty through the familiar, filtered buzz of the kind of cheap synthesizers usually found in techno and dance tracks.  Paradoxically, the sounds that have constituted some of the most vapid, hedonistic, and forgettable music of our time have now returned to make us cry.</p><p>  M83 open <em>Dead Cities</em> with one of their most striking misappropriations of trite instrumentation. In ""Birds"", a tinny sample of chirping birds is combined with swells of synth strings and a computerized voice repeating, ""Sun is shining, birds are singing, flowers are growing, clouds are looming and I am flying.""  The computerized voice is run through an odd, wavering melodic filter that affords it just the right degree of harmonic dissonance with the accompanying synths, and it takes on a decidedly unsettling feel, repeating its mantra-like invocation of the unsteady world you're about to enter.</p><p>  Once inside, you're exposed to a landscape of seemingly infinite depth and complexity.  Rather than just ending, sounds and songs disappear off into the horizon, continually bringing a promise of something familiar but unforeseen to follow.  ""Unrecorded"", the first full-fledged song on <em>Dead Cities</em>, makes clear the reason M83 have drawn so many My Bloody Valentine comparisons.  Building upon a foundation of fuzzed-out guitar, rich bass, synth strings, and a drum machine that sounds surprisingly like the acoustic drums of <em>Loveless</em>, the duo layers burbling techno synthesizers into complex rhythmic intersections as the song's vast backdrop slowly fades away.  Just as My Bloody Valentine refashioned distorted electric guitars as instruments capable of divine and volatile sound, M83 recast harsh sawtooth waves as voices of reflection and regret.  On ""Run into Flowers"", almost-real strings and whispered vocals are juxtaposed with overdriven drum machine clicks, as an insistent 4/4 beat evokes lush, green fields as easily as abandoned factories and polluted rivers.</p><p>  This kind of contrast factors heavily into ""In Church"", as a clear pipe organ and an angelic, reverb-laden chorus are assaulted by blasts of white noise.  Finally, a wrenching, synthesized melody enters, providing a profoundly moving counterpoint to the sterile beauty that preceded it.  By the time you get to ""0078h"", it's impossible to tell whether the heavily altered vocals are of human or computerized origin; it's also completely ceased to matter.  Oftentimes, the most organic sounds on <em>Dead Cities</em> are the most formless, and the most glaringly synthetic sounds the most emotional.</p><p> <em>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</em> ends fittingly with the 14-minute epic ""Beauties Can Die"", which recalls at first the melodic, pastoral electronica of Múm's <em>Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is OK</em>.  This peaceful opening is soon overtaken by a sound that gradually transforms from a low, earthquake-like rumble into a blast of synthesized static.  Synthesizers and harmony vocals are layered and layered until the sound is so explosively, beautifully gigantic that you won't mind it's damaging your hearing.  More earthquake rumbles follow, each ushering in even more layers of ungodly gorgeous sound and evoking a stomach-turning combination of fear and excitement.  At the crash of a synthesized cymbal, the song descends into submerged ambience, and ultimately into a long silence, before resurfacing with distorted radar blips and shrieks of howling noise.</p><p>  As ""Beauties Can Die"" fades, you're left with the feeling that you've just returned from a journey-- that the images passing through your mind for the last hour couldn't possibly have been the result of mere imagination.  An album like this extends far beyond your speakers, guiding you through an impossibly rich, detailed world of sound while also giving you room to explore it yourself; you don't listen to <em>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</em>, you inhabit it.</p><p> </p></div>"|5006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5006-dead-cities-red-seas-lost-ghosts/|9.2|Matt LeMay

    A report on the known mutant Terrence Tessora, or ""Tes"", filed this day May 11th, 2003, by Spec. Agent
    Julianne Shepherd.</p><p>
    
    Abstract:<br/>
    On the recovered document <i>x2</i>, Tes' uncanny powers were found to include: 1. the ability to spit words faster than the speed of sound; 2. the ability to spit
    said words in a youthful, nasally, sing-songy voice, for long periods of time without oxygen; 3. the ability
    to make beats appear light and minimal, yet be heavier than bricks; 4. x-ray vision. It is apparent Tes was
    not born a mutant; however, the origin of his mutations is still under debate. (Note: in previous reports,
    Tes himself has noted a change may have occurred at a ""roller rink"" while hearing Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet
    Rock"" for the first time; UNDER INVESTIGATION.)</p><p>
    
    According to the dossier, said mutant has been living out his identity undercover; specifically, in the
    labyrinthine fronds of the Brooklyn underground rap scene. Known associates: Vast Aire (of the known
    ""Cannibal Ox"" cell) and Afra (a Japanese mutant with the ability to make awesome percussive noises by using
    his mouth, lips and tongue). In the <i>x2</i> document, the names ""LoDeck"" and ""DJ Ese"" (investigate: magneto?)
    came up more than once as conspirators in Tes' mission.</p><p>
    
    This special agent believes <i>x2</i> to be a highly advanced form of communication. In addition to the
    subject's vocal powers, whose cadences play a choppy kind of ""jump-rope"" code we have yet to decipher,
    Tes' musical system is also relatively unique. Whereas many previously recovered audio documents have
    merely been crude or one-dimensional keyboard transmissions, Tes has developed a way to combine a minimalist
    code of rhythms with a delicate aesthetic of melody, often including crackles and whirs derived from ancient
    human appliances, such as the ""turntable."" We believe its simple, ominous beauty is meant to throw infiltrators
    off its trail, while still transmitting information to those advanced mutants who have become familiar with
    the dialect of ""underground rap"" and the ongoing experiment known as ""Warp-touched hip-hop."" We have seen
    similar types of transmissions in several other cells-- including those on the ""fresh coast,"" and those
    operating out of the New York metro area.</p><p>
    
    This geographic connection may in fact be a key to understanding Tes and his fellow operatives, though at
    times, the subject inflects a tone found in cells of a more southerly location. In the most compelling file,
    characterized by a humid, soulful melody and marked simply ""New New York"", Tes uses his voice to transmit
    the following powerful message: ""If you listen to Tes, you know where I'm from/ Fuck where you at, I'm the
    original one."" This home-base pride permeates the message of many other files in <i>x2</i>, such as ""Late
    to Work"", which combines a certain work ethic (""Fool Time"": ""Don't watch the clock, it's a waste of time/
    And even if they pay you, don't make it by nine"") with a feeling of societal imprisonment (""My Receiver"":
    ""Get compelled/ To propel/ Steppin' through hell/ Tramplin' the fate I was dealt/ Saw both sides but didn't
    like either/ Chose to block out both with the sound of my receiver/ Good and evil always push their presence
    on the scene."" The Agency believes this to be a direct communication.)</p><p>
    
    Conclusion:<br/>
    While potentially dangerous to ""other emcees,"" Tes' <i>x2</i> document could be an important
    comrade in human/mutant unity.  NOTE: other agents on our team were concerned with the transmission ""I've
    changed/ Extended my brain/ [indecipherable] Satellite strike like war games/ In the past, I was the future,""
    on the file marked ""Change"".  However, given his discursive interest in evolution, team consensus holds that
    Tes is likely to use his powers for good, not evil.</p><p>

    Boys, a smoother, slinkier sideshow to GVSB's rumbling main event.  That was, however, eight years ago,
    and a lot has changed since then.  GVSB tanked on the utterly plastic and lifeless <i>Freak*on*ica</i> way
    back in 1998, and they've only just begun to regain any steam with last year's slight return <i>You Can't
    Fight What You Can't See</i>.  Meanwhile, New Wet Kojak have released a string of great albums, to the point
    where they're now even more consistent than GVSB ever were.</p><p>
<i>This Is the Glamorous</i> is the band's fourth full-length since vocalist Scott McCloud and bassist Johnny
    Temple began seeing other people, and it's definitely got a shinier wax job than any of their previous albums,
    but where their other band was choked nearly to death by overproduction, this one fairly thrives on it.
    McCloud could hardly be described as melodic, but his distinctive declamations sound fantastic in New Wet
    Kojak's greasy-haired soup of thumping backbeat, laser synth and freaky sax.</p><p>
    
    The band rides in triumphantly on the kinetic guitar and blorping bass of ""The World of Shampoo"", with Charles
    Bennington's harmonized sax channeling Morphine's Dana Colley and McCloud's slightly gruff sing-speak riding
    easily in the fore. ""Supermodel Citizens USA"" is positively anthemic by this band's standards, surging in
    its choruses on the back of some great guitar and piling on the tension in the verses until it becomes almost
    overpowering.</p><p>
    
    With its fat bassline and cloud of sax, ""Nothing You Can Say"" picks up the Morphine ball and runs with it,
    piling on electronics for good measure, but Bennington's best moments come amidst the whooping synth noises
    and rock-steady rhythms of ""Something Easy"".  His sax burns on multiple tracks in the background, some of
    them distorted, others writhing in free jazz ecstasy.  It's been said in these pages multiple times before
    (including once in reference to this very band) that the sax is definitely due for a comeback in rock.  If
    you require evidence of that claim, just check out the songs I just mentioned, or the record's closer
    ""Reverse the Curse"", which overflows with a rich sax arrangement that absolutely makes the song.</p><p>
    
    There are a few curious moments on <i>This Is the Glamorous</i> that make me wonder if this project is
    starting to run out of ideas, chief among them being ""Jealous"".  The album title originally appeared in
    the band's catalog three years ago in a line from ""The Overkill"", the second song on the excellent <i>Do
    Things</i>.  Strangely, the band recycles the line over and over in ""Jealous"" here, which is odd, because
    the phrase really doesn't mean much to begin with.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, though, the band remains utterly conscious of their own sleazy/scenester come-on schtick, as
    evidenced by the nonchalantly delivered lyrics of ""Let's Get Glorified"", where a bored-sounding McCloud
    offers, ""I hear you're hanging out/ And stuff/ Hanging out/ Et cetera/ Doing a lot of bad things.""  It's as
    though he wants to care, but can't quite bring himself to.  So let the word go out, good people: New Wet
    Kojak are still in the game.  <i>This Is the Glamorous</i> isn't their best (that's still <i>Nasty
    International</i>), but it's a solid entry into the canon of a surprisingly long-lived band, one that
    seems destined to outlive its own roots.</p></div>"|5778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5778-this-is-the-glamorous/|7.4|Joe Tangari

    Mountain Goats, and the cryptic skree of dozens of lesser-known, hiss-ridden troubadours. Likewise,
    stream-of-the-cuff releases by tape labels like Shrimper, Catsup Plate, and Union Pole were defined by a
    hand-scribbled, super-arcane but friendly DIY mystique. Put the two parts together and the distorted,
    crackling sounds of faceless songwriters arrived unedited from darkened corners of small-town disorientation
    on an almost daily basis. It was a less populated network of obsessive discontents, documenting basements
    and sunken porches, entropy and broken relationships, via unadorned four-tracks, duct-taped guitars, and
    stolen elementary school cassette recorders.</p><p>
    
    I don't know much about Iran beyond the obvious: they're from San Francisco, and are a trio. On the cover
    of their latest record, there's a dark-eyed girl in a flannel shirt resting below a painting of some ducks
    and mountains.  The CD booklet is littered with ink drawings: a dragon, a squirrel eyeing pills or acorns,
    a crying baby, some kid with a swastika on his forehead and a fish in each hand, an elf with a rifle, a
    hand forming the shape of a gun, an amputated arm sprouting diamonds or moon rocks. The centerpiece is a
    collage of a winged child on a leather couch with a friend, who, obscured by his pal's wings, appears to be
    smoking. The back panel's marked with mixing directives, language for establishing a perfect sound: ""More
    dynamics over all (song to song and within song)."" I've re-read this at least fifteen times, yet nothing
    becomes clear.</p><p>
<i>The Moon Boys</i> is Iran's second album: it's a frost-bound anthology of claustrophobic hymns to
    leaving/not leaving, black eyes, hushed voices, windows, silence, the night, mirrors, and strangulation.
    While less sonically virulent than their self-titled debut, it remains spiraling and unfathomably dense
    as a documentation of plush, damaged interiority, twelve discordant halos soiling the carpet.</p><p>
    
    Deft at shaping and repackaging noise, Iran pummel channels and burden eardrums while sneaking hooks through
    your skin: imagine Simon Wickham-Smith, Three Mile Pilot, and Goosewind collaborating with Arab Strap on
    muted/mutating pop, sung all at once by Wallpaper, Lou Barlow, and Elliott Smith. If that makes no sense,
    pretend you're listening loudly to Xiu Xiu, and this is what it sounds like from next door. The walls are
    thin; even the slightest motions bleed, confusing the space.</p><p>
    
    ""The Moon Shines Bright"" strings together echoes of psych fireworks, and for whatever reason reminded me of
    a split lip. Maybe it's the ferocity of the guitar picking and drone, or the fucked-up-on-codeine vocals
    trying to paint stars black, to overload the world with personal darkness. It's tough finding an exact match,
    though I'm getting Luxurious Bags backed by Harry Pussy or Richard Youngs gone hard-ass bubblegum. ""Four
    Armed Star"" creates sub-textual fuzz with two sets of vocals, one like a fractured kazoo. Both are buried
    by a de-tuning of the environment; as in most of the tracks, certain notes and words are hidden, but at the
    center someone's threatening to leave or to stay.  The largely instrumental ""Wuthering Heights"" is Heathcliff
    hanging Isabella's dog within a romantic geography of wind and bent trees, trumpet and clarinet across the
    grassy lea. I thought of Loren Connors tripping a landmine. Balancing psychosis and the erotic, the
    off-kilter, ever-spinning ""Fading Out"" is creepy and tender and catchy: ""I pull the sheets above my head/
    I was hiding in your bed/ It made you laugh but I guess you'll still be leaving anyway.""</p><p>
<i>The Moon Boys</i> is fucking beautiful, a dizzying revelry, but also a scary, late-night lock-down.  With
    repeated listens sounds bloom, open and deepen, and a story develops. Hooks disappear. Flubbed notes remain
    and turn dusty, then to prismatic gold. Dynamics unravel. Dew looks like piss. Air cuts out. Indistinct
    things distract from earlier fixations without detracting. It's hearing a far-off cry in a dark forest, or
    two blocks over in your own city, and knowing the next day you should've intervened. These are momentary
    transmissions from faulty cables, remaining long enough to declare a hook, break apart, disengage, then
    disappear.</p><p>

This metaphor is paper-thin!
    People aren't gonna know what the hell you're talking about.</p><p>
    
    Andrew Bryant (AB): But that's the point. It's so dumb that people will have to let loose at least a chuckle.</p><p>
    
    RS: Bah.  Let me hear it one more time, I guess.</p><p>
    
    AB: Alright.  You have your plain chicken, which is boring and no one under the age of 40 really enjoys.
    So what do you do with it?  [pause]  You stuff all of the chicken inside of a duck.  Now you have your
    ducken.  But that's still pretty boring, because ducks don't have any character, even with the addition of
    excess poultry.  Therefore, you take that ducken, and stuff it all inside of a turkey to get your full
    turducken, which is getting close to, but just shy of, an interesting meal.</p><p>
    
    RS: I'm still waiting to laugh.</p><p>
    
    AB: Right.  Next, the band comes along and declares that what would make the meal even better is to take all
    of those fowl elements and further stuff them into a Jayhawk, thus producing the final product, the jayhawkturducken!
    The meal is a symbol of how the group envelops the different elements of music available to them-- from folk,
    to rock, to Gram Parsons-influenced pop-- in such a way that is alternately enjoyable and excessively
    off-putting.  This culminates in The Jayhawks' latest release, <i>Rainy Day Music</i>, which serves as a
    prime example of the trend.  And as an added bonus, the jayhawkturducken is composed completely of fictional
    and non-fictional ""Byrds.""</p><p>
    
    RS: Interesting, but somehow lacking.  Maybe if you worked on the substance over style, you would have
    something a bit more pleasing and less... well... less bad.</p><p>
    
    Sound advice friend.  Sound advice.</p><p>
    
    One can coast only so far on the semblance of a good idea, and even the best of people suffer from the
    albatross of their reputation.  That said, <i>Rainy Day Music</i> is nothing if not a pleasant album.
    Steering away from the immediate gratification of their highly Beach Boys-inspired 2000 release <i>Smile</i>,
    the band comes full circle with a return to their alt-country roots in the tradition of Neil Young or The
    Flying Burrito Brothers.  This is no more apparent than on ""Stumbling Through the Dark"", a Gary Louris and
    Matthew Sweet co-write, which starts the album off on an incredibly strong foot.  Short and to the point,
    the song begins with a hint of 90s alt-rock before sliding into a breezy, banjo-driven chorus that's
    instantly accessible and hummable, apparent even in the bonus acoustic version tacked on to the end of the
    album.</p><p>
    
    ""All the Right Reasons"" slows down the tempo a bit allowing the band to flex their harmonic power over the
    course of the affirming ballad before steering towards ""Save It for a Rainy Day"", a song that wouldn't be
    out of place on an Alex Chilton solo album.  The following track, ""Eyes of Sarahjane"", gives a leash to the
    organ, which explores as best it can the areas not completely dominated by pointless guitar soloing and
    Louris' twangy tenor.  ""One Man's Problem"" rounds out the satisfying first half of the album with its
    wavering bassline and breezy chorus where the guys drop benign rock lyric nuggets like, ""I don't expect you
    to see/ But she's important to me, babe/ I guess it's just one man's problem.""</p><p>
    
    It's during the latter portion of the album that the music begins to suffer from what sounds like a mix of
    neglect and overcompensation.  The Tim O'Reagan song ""Don't Let the World Get in Your Way"" sounds more like
    my little cousin-- hairbrush in hand-- singing along to David Bowie's ""Major Tom"".  Other Louris written
    tracks such as ""Come to the River"", ""Madman"", and ""You Look So Young"" simply sound forced, pushing the
    combination of what constitutes alt-country and folk-rock to its limit of self-parody, and at times
    irreversibly crossing that line.</p><p>
    
    A modicum of respect is salvaged with the bonus disc of material that accompanies the original release of
    the album.  The mini-album, entitled <i>More Rain</i>, gives a more intimate glimpse at the band with the
    exclusive track ""Fools on Parade"" (originally released for Spanish magazine <i>Rock Sound</i>), and
    acoustic/demo versions of album cuts such as ""Reasons"" and ""Tampa to Tulsa"" that shed light on how great
    a songwriter Louris truly is.  The inclusion of a live version of the beloved ""Waiting for the Sun"", off of
    the exemplary <i>Hollywood Town Hall</i>, is both a delight and a disappointment in that while it's
    undoubtedly one of the band's greatest songs it poignantly displays how circular the group's recordings
    have become.  <i>Rainy Day Music</i> is ultimately the sound of a dog (or more appropriately a bird) chasing
    its own tail, content with plugging away at the same formula as long as there's still precedence for
    satisfying their musical niche.</p></div>"|4222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4222-rainy-day-music/|6.1|Andrew Bryant

    more specifically its ""history"" page, which depicts a brilliantly detailed goth nightmare. In a wintry
    forest, a human with a crudely pasted-on horse head embraces a dog, frost breath issuing from its snout.
    In the background are two wild boars, and upon contact with your cursor (mouseover, in the HTML parlance)
    the beasts lift off, rise several feet in the air and proceed to dangle there, irritated.  It's not a
    terribly functional page-- one boar bears an MP3, another a video-- but it's one of the most distinctive
    I've ever seen, a formidable piece of art in itself.</p><p>
    
    And the inevitable segue: I wish I could say the same about Goldfrapp or their new album, <em>Black Cherry</em>.
    The bestial spookiness is there-- disturbing woman-dog hybrids are all over the booklet, and ""Wolf Lady
    sucks my brain"" is actually a prominent lyric of the first single-- but that's it. This platter of
    overproduced come-hither electropop is a polyester successor to the band's silky 2000 debut <em>Felt
    Mountain</em>.</p><p>
    
    Continuing the sartorial analogy, vocalist Alison Goldfrapp's purr is still decked out in the sexiest sonic
    lace money can buy: swooping string passages, languid sampler bleeps, whooshing pads, double bass. These are,
    by now, pretty rote signifiers of sophistication; while the loungy orchestration of <em>Felt Mountain</em>
    didn't raise any flags at the time, <em>Black Cherry</em>'s oh-so-timely shift to electro beats will make
    many scream ""ambulance chasers!"" Add my reluctant voice to that growing chorus.</p><p>
    
    From the title on down, the new CD tries hard to conjure an ambiance of languid sin-- opium, absinthe,
    vintage porn-- but that aesthetic is just a few steps from your average bachelor pad with a zebra throw
    and ceiling mirrors. In fact, that's where copies of this album will inevitably spin, a soundtrack to
    excruciatingly banal seduction.</p><p>
    
    The songs themselves, though hard to see through all this velvet fog, are a grab bag of trendy tactics. The
    first single ""Train"" is an ancient shuffle, rendered in quantized beats and fuzzy synths. You may recall
    that Liz Phair used this idea on ""Baby Got Going"". Goldfrapp's lyrics (opening line: ""Plastic brain scar/
    I want laser"") are probably supposed to bewilder, but instead they annoy.  On the mellower end, the title
    track sounds like early Air, and ""Tiptoe""-- the strongest song on the record-- mightily recalls Tori Amos
    circa <em>From the Choirgirl Hotel</em>.  (Pardon the barrage of direct and obvious comparisons, but the
    songwriting is faceless enough to warrant it.)</p><p>
    
    It couldn't be more ironic, then, that it's <em>Black Cherry</em> and not its predecessor that's truly broken
    the Brit duo in the homeland, netting them a <i>Top of the Pops</i> appearance and a place in the charts.
    The bad news is that the opacity of Goldfrapp's intentions will turn against them: they could be first-class
    ironists, but that will hardly matter when Alison's soft coos begin to lull customers into buying $200
    panties at Agent Provocateur.</p></div>"|3505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3505-black-cherry/|5.8|Michael Idov

    by that most inconsistent concern, the Various Artists: the fake rock opera, the real rock opera tribute,
    the fake film soundtrack, the fake band tribute, etc.  Now we must bear witness to the fake-soundtrack-tribute-to-a-real-film-that-already-had-a-soundtrack-that-wasn't-released,
    a plight lubricated (depending on your level of boredom with these acts) by the promise of unreleased
    recordings by Will Oldham, Wilco, Mark Eitzel, and Sonic Youth, as well as some previously available
    (yet absurdly labeled ""rare"" on the disc's wrapper) tracks by Cat Power, Roscoe Holcomb, Leadbelly and
    Sandy Bull.</p><p>
    Being fake-soundtrack-tributed is Monte Hellman's 1971 film <i>Two-Lane Blacktop</i>, an uncanny narrative (advertised
    with the slogan ""The Far-Out World of the High-Speed Scene!"") about bohemian gearheads, a film ""road"" enough
    to wow the garage-begreased, and existential enough to intrigue the coffeeshop-ponytailed.  Anyone who knows
    anything about the incognito monopolies with which car companies destroyed railroads, or about how our
    Interstate system was based on Hitler's autobahn (not to mention his reich's use of film to glorify
    people-machines), might figure a libertinist car movie more counterintuitive than countercultural,
    especially when one considers that the ""easy rider/on the road"" motif quickly blossomed into <i>Dukes of
    Hazzard</i>/<i>Fast and the Furious</i> fetishism.</p><p>
    However, <i>Two-Lane Blacktop</i> constantly entertains and surprises.  At the beginning of the film, James
    Taylor and The Beach Boys' Dennis Wilson seem miscast in such car-porn, clutching big sticks, talking about
    cleaning rods and points, and declaring in a diner parking lot how there's ""a lot of muscle here tonight.""
    Soon, though, their macho-femininity contrasts interestingly with a drifting girl (tired of their talk of
    cars' rear ends, she says, ""I don't see anybody paying attention to <i>my</i> rear end!"") and a suave
    status-quoppie running from his life. Their endless race, their strangely communal competition, their
    implausible line readings, and the ethereality of their lusts result in the film's barely resembling
    America, or Earth.  At some points, <i>Two-Lane Blacktop</i> plays like the car film that Kubrick would
    have made (if he wasn't making <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> at the time). And its appeal lasts: elements of
    <i>Two-Lane Blacktop</i> pervade later films as variegated as <i>Duel</i>, the <i>Cannonball Run</i> series,
    <i>White Men Can't Jump</i>, <i>Bottle Rocket</i>, and <i>Y Tu Mamá También</i>.</p><p>
    Now onto why this comp is so conceptually mangled: the film already had plenty of music. ""Hit the Road Jack""
    predictably plays in a grimy spoon, and The Doors and Kristofferson surface elsewise. Also, Taylor and Wilson's
    insanely focused characters went without music, intentionally, preferring the roar of their engine. The Girl
    (that's her name in the credits) sings her own versions of songs. The only character with a constant
    soundtrack is ""GTO"", the status-quoppie; he plays plenty of country and bluegrass, so this CD's suggesting
    other roots music is odd. The liner notes say that the project's organizer wanted this to be ""what the
    characters heard while driving,"" which might explain why these contemporary artists contributed either
    vintage-sounding ditties or (why oh why couldn't Sonic Youth and Mark Eitzel have imagined what they'd have
    sounded like in 1971?) abstract noise-clusters.</p><p>
    So if you'd never heard the high lonesomeness of Sandy Bull, Leadbelly, or Roscoe Holcomb, or the previously
    released Calexico, Giant Sand, and Cat Power songs, I guess they'd be revelations; if you know them, this is
    awkward, like a love-mix from a new squeeze bearing songs the last three squeezes gave you.  (The Girl has
    Chan Marshall bangs, and behavior, and she sings ""Satisfaction"" in the film, so trotting out Cat Power's
    great-the-first-time, annoying-the-nth-time cover of The Stones' oft-muzacked gem is at least warranted.)</p><p>
    So: New stuff!  Will Oldham teams with Alan Licht (the last third of whose <i>An Emotional Memoir of Martha
    Quinn</i> should be required reading for pop-nerds) to deliver a rehash of his oft-bootlegged live favorite
    cover ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"". After Oldham sets up the spike, Licht reads James Taylor's best lines
    from the film for five minutes. (Note: Will's muttering wave-and-wax-obsessed role as The Surfer in <i>Slitch</i>
    is clearly modeled after Taylor's muttering oil-and-octane obsessed role as The Driver.) Willophiles would
    do much better to skip this and track down the latest volume of <i>Louisville Is for Lovers</i>, on which
    Will covers Lucinda Williams' ""Something About What Happens When We Talk""-- that wrenching cover had me
    afraid to leave the house, wearing a hairnet, and taping peppermints to my collarbones, whereas ""Don't Cry,
    Driver"" just had me typing cusswords into the crappy search engine at Netflix.</p><p>
    Wilco offer ""Old Maid"", an acoustic guitar, backgrounded piano, and brush-drum retro affair that recalls
    lackadaisical Dylan or Prine (another oft-bootlegged live favorite). It's fun to hear Tweedy play the geezer,
    but this is Wilco on cruise control, which violates every rule of <i>Two-Lane Blacktop</i>.  Alvarius B (of
    Sun City Girls) contributes a song that, even though B's career predates David Pajo's, perfectly mimics Papa
    M. The German ragaist (I told you this disc was a contradiction in terms wrapped in a contradiction in terms)
    Steffen Basho-Junghans delivers a mega-soothing slide pastiche.  Marc Eitzel teams with his sometime wurlitzist
    Marc Capelle to make a messy cackle-and-grind soundscape more akin to the ominous <i>Wild at Heart</i> (another
    film that homages <i>Two-Lane Blacktop</i>).</p><p>
    In other news: Suntanama betray their black-oak bombast with some mellow zylophonic post-cock-rock,
    Charalambides inflict their heaviest vampire-ambience, and Sonic Youth fucks around with pedals for six
    Cousteau-ian minutes (really, they should label their stuff either Sonic Youth A or B, so you know if
    you're getting a rock band or Harry Partch-versus-Schoenberg-at-Radio-Shack). Roy Montgomery rocks the
    whole record with his unchanging 12+ minute phaser-fest ""2LB"" which summons Slint, Ween, and countless
    Bootsy Collins space-freak-outs.  This track alone best befits the glorious ending of <i>Two-Lane Blacktop</i>,
    which to this day puzzles those who wank to aftermarket mags, even more than Harry Dean Stanton's cameo as
    a dejected homosexual hitchhiker.</p></div>"|1955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1955-you-can-never-go-fast-enough/|6.9|William Bowers

    god, and utterly worthless.  The exotic productions of 60s stereo pimps and failed pop bandleaders were
    campy to be sure, but in many cases, they were often obscure enough to afford the kind of off-kilter
    experimentation that wouldn't otherwise stand a chance on a bill with Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin.  Guys
    like Les Baxter and Martin Denny weren't part of any counter-culture that might have had them, but were
    making strange music nonetheless; escapism, as sexy and thrilling as decent folk might ever be allowed to
    imagine, was their game, and if their silicone-injected future-visions had a fault, it was one closer to
    comfort than kitsch.</p><p>
    
    Thirty years later, enter Stereolab and their retooled version of this ideal, filtered through increasingly
    straight-faced takes on posh retro-pop and kid-proof krautrock.  I'll have you know that I'm one of the few
    who didn't balk when their album covers went two-tone; part of this is due to the fact that I already owned
    more than one Baxter LP, and was only too happy to hear people who approached mood music from the same warped
    innocence.  However, it also seemed to me that on records like <i>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</i> and <i>Sound-Dust</i>,
    the band weren't just playing odes to a bygone age, pumped up with electronic steroids-- they were becoming
    part of the same legacy, and carving their own niche as purveyors of the very same fake future the old
    masters did (though I guess those guys weren't quite so, er, Socialist).</p><p>
    
    During the mid-90s, 'Lab co-leader Laetitia Sadier hooked up with fellow eccentric Rosie Cuckston of Pram,
    to record a few tunes at Cuckston's studio.  Despite both women's considerable pedigrees with atmosphere and
    studio manipulation, these sessions yielded low-key, minimalist pop songs that might have fit on albums for
    either's respective bands (though were probably a bit on the soft side).  Later, without Cuckston, Sadier
    continued to put down tracks on her own (""Cache Cache"", featured here, ended up as a Stereolab B-side), and
    if anything, that material was even more laid-back.  Replacing the expected space-age spark is a pleasant
    obligation to nothing other than passing an afternoon away with easy melodies and analog orchestrations.
    Detractors of post-<i>ETK</i> Stereolab will likely appreciate the stripped-down (though hardly lo-fi) feel
    of <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>, but I can't help but think this music could have used some of that good
    old silicone veneer.</p><p>
    
    ""Un Express"" is very reminiscent of <i>Dots and Loops</i>-era 'Lab, with its repetitive chord structure,
    synth interjections, understated brass, and especially the peppy, rhythm-box percussion sparkle ending.
    Sadier's distant moan transforms an interesting experiment in homemade post-rock into very alluring
    electronic pop, reminiscent of Raymond Scott's similarly homemade adventures of the 60s.  Another highlight
    is the aforementioned ""Cache Cache"", beginning like the scary part in the Hawaii episode of <i>The Brady
    Bunch</i>, with slinky acoustic bass, accordion and Fender Rhodes.  Soon enough, the deft shuffle of
    hand-percussion rubs up nice and smooth next to Sadier's always-gorgeous monotone French.  This tune
    reminds me of the prog-lounge of <i>Sound-Dust</i>, though there's tenderness at work that I'm not sure
    I've ever really heard with Stereolab.</p><p>
<i>Socialisme</i> runs out of steam during the numbers that fail to emphasize its more immediate pop aspects,
    and also in parts that are just too smooth for their own good.  ""Vent de Sud"" might have been an interesting
    fantasy-disco number all dolled up in Elektra production values, but here it basically sounds like a
    demo-quality exercise in Casio-powered funk.  ""Enfin Seule"" should be a dreamy ride through trombone heaven,
    but seems too flat, while ""Sunrise Telling"" doesn't have much more going for it other than the vintage fuzz
    on the bass.</p><p>
    
    Fans of either Pram or Stereolab should find something to enjoy on this record-- and it's not as if any of
    it is exactly off-putting.  I might have wished for something more lively, but then, these are ""bedroom
    recordings.""  It could be that just as the classic exotic sounds of vintage bachelor-pad pop weren't built
    to last beyond their era, this music sounds best in its own tiny frame.</p></div>"|5388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5388-socialisme-ou-barbarie-the-bedroom-recordings/|6.5|Dominique Leone

    demonic wraiths running the company must have hatched an abominable scheme.  Not content merely to brainwash
    the children of the world into Apple loyalty through complimentary comps for schools, marketing goblins
    created the perfect method of seducing an entirely new market demo: the hipsters.</p><p>
    ""By distributing Powerbooks to the IDM artists of the world, we will be able to influence countless scores
    of captive concert audiences!"" the hooded and clawed demonlord Steve Jobs (who just <i>wants you to
    think he doesn't run the company any more) probably cackled, adding, ""Muuuuh-hahahahahahahaha. Ha! Ha!
    Har-har! Ha!""</i></p><p>
    Rarely does a show go by these days without branding the fascistic logo of Apple into the crowd's retinas;
    they're as hard to miss as swooshes at football games.  Through some incestuous scene peer pressure,
    Powerbook requirements have even spread to rock bands, and no artist dares perform his latest programming
    compositions without the softly glowing fruit silhouette hovering below squinting eyes as he delicately
    point-clicks through a song.</p><p>
    Styrofoam (neé Arne Van Petegem) is one of the more recent Powerbook hunchbacks I've seen, both opening and
    manning the click-tracks for The Notwist.  Focused entirely on his liquid crystal display, trying to look
    busy making minute adjustments to pre-arranged music files and occasionally singing, his solo set was every
    bit as boring as I imagined a live laptop performance could be, standing in stark contrast to the
    surprisingly spontaneous band-technology intercourse of headliner's set. </p><p>
    So it comes as something of a surprise how much I enjoy Styrofoam's third release, <i>I'm What's There to
    Show That Something's Missing</i>.  I've heard enough of the label by now to know that this is paint-by-numbers
    Morr music: laid-back pop generously enervated with microhouse ingredients.  But Styrofoam is less lap-pop
    than lap-folk, his songs built on foundations of circular acoustic guitar figures and whispery vocals.  If
    it wasn't for the drag-and-drop modifications, Van Petegem would be your Thursday night coffeehouse
    distraction; with the electronoise, he's the coffeehouse performer in Tomorrowland.</p><p>
    The obvious comparisons to The Notwist are too distinct to ignore-- ""You Pretend You Own This Place"" sounds
    like a distant cousin to ""Consequence""-- but Styrofoam is into an even deeper Quaalude haze then his
    countrymen, the snap-crackle percussion tracks merely circling the melodies with a thin frame of nervous
    energy.  In a largely bass-less environment (only ""If I Believed You Back into Focus"" possesses what I
    would unashamedly call ""beats""), the only dance move it induces is the soporific head nod.  It's easy to be
    lulled into a trance by this music, especially with the lullaby sentiments of ""The Long Wait"" and ""Blow It
    Away from Your Eyes"" cooing in your ears. </p><p>
    Styrofoam occasionally manages to snap his fingers in your face, to get you to listen more carefully, as
    on the soaring ""A Heart Without a Mind"".  With somber ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" guitar lines competing with neon
    synthesizer pirouettes, Van Petegem somehow conjures up an epic out of micro-implements and vocals that make
    Sam Prekop sound hardcore.  Save the heavy-handed Books-ish vocal samples eavesdropping on the neighbors
    fighting in ""Forever, You Said Forever"", he preserves this balance throughout.</p><p>
    Perhaps because I never quite immersed myself in the clicks-and-cuts movement, Styrofoam still sounds fresh
    to me, where it might not to a more studied follower of the laptop scene.  Or perhaps Van Petegem is just a
    rung above the rest of his mates in the Morr stable, slightly more handy with a melody, or has hit upon a
    new, compelling kind of slow-glitch.  Perhaps the latest models of Powerbook have some kind of eeeeeevil
    hypnosis plug-in to woo the minds of any zine scribes in the audience.  Either way, Styrofoam is a missionary
    of the Apple's diabolical operation mindcrime that's easy to forgive, a Powerbook hunchback to know and love.</p></div>"|7545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7545-im-whats-there-to-show-that-somethings-missing/|7.8|Rob Mitchum

I'm looking at two right now, on the subway down to St. Mark's Square.
    One is wearing this pink plaid dress with baggy camouflage pants underneath it and a Latrell Sprewell jersey
    on top, all completed by canary-yellow high-heels and an askew fedora. Her friend has a classic mullet, a
    puffy North Face parka, thigh-high lime-green stockings, and a pair of beat-up Converse All-Stars. Somehow
    they're pulling off both Exquisite Corpse looks, as only the Japanese can, carrying it with just the right
    touch of innocent panache, while also looking hotter than <i>Bukkake on the Bayou</i> starring the Ass-Fuck
    Twins.</p><p>
    
    I don't exactly feel perverted, as this is merely the same sort of drooling veneration that the Pitchfork
    staff has always had for all things Boredoms. While not one to have pin-ups of Yoshimi in his house (*cough*,
    Dom, *cough*), I have actively sought out any and all appearances of her holding an instrument and/or
    striking a resonant surface. Her two-minute singles for Ecstatic Peace are cherished objects of Dada doo-doo
    gibberish beatific to a sicko like myself. Even Editor Ryan Schreiber has a closet fetish for all things
    Cibo Matto, so how could we not like this collaboration? Why is this disc of glorious, do-no-wrong babes
    just not happening? It's Yoshimi P-We and Yuka Honda hooking up, fer Christ sakes, yet it feels so much
    like they're just calling it in from halfway across the world-- if they're even in the same room.</p><p>
    
    ""UMEgination"" is a gentle opener of cocktail piano, crickets, and digitized chirps, parting the bamboo
    curtain into a Martin Denny tiki hut of baboons politely rattling bells. It recalls the weirdo work that
    Boredoms went through years before, doing their own version of ""jungle,"" which included lots of lounge
    gestures run through ginsu blades. It's pleasant enough, but from there a grip on the album becomes slippery,
    or rather so lax that there's nothing to hold onto until it's well into the middle of the nine-minute fourth
    track, ""Spy Said One"", when another interesting concoction of sounds becomes audible. This time around, the
    girls sound like the chance meeting of the listening dog on classic RCA labels mixing it up with the
    laissez-faire trumpet of A&amp;M; honcho Herb Alpert.  An interesting sound clash, but it scarcely engages for
    more than a few minutes.</p><p>
    
    ""Mow Deck in Eye"" is twenty-seven minutes of the sort of faux ethno-forgery that Boredoms magnificently
    stretched beyond the breaking point on <i>Super Roots 6</i>. Mushing together some of Yoko Ono's classic
    toothy chitter, some lethargic piano, and haphazard sound tweaking, it's topped off by weary chants and hand
    drums. It's not so much dreamy as it is lazy and indolent. ""Elegant Bird"" is the most exquisite of the
    bunch, and it's where the Yoshimi's new age piano resonates best, plinking amongst floating moans and
    cymbals. That it concisely clears two minutes exhibits a sense of self-editing scarcely executed elsewhere.</p><p>
    
    If anything, <i>Flower with No Color</i> reminds me of another pedestrian collaboration from earlier in the
    year, from Richard Youngs and Matthew Bower as Youngsbower, in which no amount of intricate multitracking

    <i>Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives</i>-- hasn't made his name as a purveyor of confessional music.  The
    closest he ever came was the laptop catharsis of Delarosa and Asora, which had no secrets to tell; rather,
    its intricacies of meter and texture gave your head something to do while your guts spilled out over it.
    <i>Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives</i> was hard-edged and fast-cutting, immersed in early rap techniques
    and sensibilities; it didn't express feelings, it steamrolled them.  But <i>One Word Extinguisher</i> shows
    a range of emotional grappling usually foreign to instrumental hip-hop.  It's clear that Herren was coming
    back to the studio night after night not just for skills and thrills, but for a measure of solace.  Make no
    mistake: This is a breakup record.</p><p>
    
    ""The never-ending battle"" is what Herren calls the break-up that lasted for the year-plus during which this
    album was in production.  ""I locked myself in my room working, disconnected the phone, bummed out as fuck,""
    he told <i>CMJ</i> in March.  ""You can't talk to anybody, you feel like shit, and it's the only thing you
    have to express yourself.""  A year of unspeakable suffering channeled into sixty ripe minutes: In the hands
    of anyone else, it could be torture.  This sorrow, however, sparks with a sweeping wail of queasy ahhh's
    that carry stunted hopes for a soon-to-be-doomed relationship.  Vocal scraps and a blood-curdling scream
    announce the descent of the mask of hip-hop rage, as an eightfold synth-scribbling bomb drops right into
    ""The End of Biters"", the first of several sucker-punching cutfests in the illustrious tradition of the
    edit record.  Next comes Diverse's self-absorbed ""Plastic"", a screed that rails with righteous indignation
    against ""pop trends and predetermined top-tens.""  All this over-the-top rebuke is obviously an escape from
    something.</p><p>
    
    Things begin to come into focus as ""Uprock and Invigorate"" bounces in with its edges exposed.  Warm,
    fretless bass, flitting Rhodes, drizzling sawtooth, and a brittle snare become intent on stocking up and
    locking down with every passing bar.  But beneath the surface lies a hint of tension between the percussive
    exoskeleton and its syrupy core, an orderly contest of soul-versus-machine that momentarily eclipses the
    sense of loss.  The rest of the album projects this kind of tension into a giant battle of the sexes.  ""The
    Color of Tempo"" mangles its feminine samples with a virile beatbox pattern; ""90% of My Mind Is with You""
    breaks up heavy panting with a deliberately difficult, meter-defying beat, and ends with a series of
    mournful, defeated R&amp;B; samples.  There can be no more doubt when, on ""Female Demands"", a girlfriendish
    voice casually tells Herren to ""fuck with the beat here"" only to be throttled by digital effects; the
    rest of the track feels like a giant damaged gynorcism.  Before we know it, we're desperately trying to
    forget her, bumping with another woman who croons ""you... you... you..."" on the offs.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, straight meters are often sprinkled with triplet ligaments, propelling the beat with an
    uncommonly light touch.  But Prefuse's rhythmic sophistication isn't just about alternating threes and
    fours-- as the lesson goes, it takes two interlocked meters to make African music.  While Herren rarely
    tries to stand up in two meters at once, he often relies on the juxtaposition of mildly divergent rhythmic
    feels within the same beat, proving his mastery of some of the subtler tensions available to the
    instrumentalist.  This gives him access to some very subtle tensions-- though many tracks seem like tricks
    to distract us from the ongoing devastation.  Sooner or later, it sinks in that we're in the company of an
    emotional fugitive, sealed in a room with machines whose perfect control, he is convinced, will allow him
    to avoid the inevitable emotional reckoning.  Through scorn and bombast, through distraction and self-parody,
    through the sheer weight of craft, this Prefuse tries to wear his sorrow down, to crush himself, to explode
    the emptiness.  A thrilling listen, but how could such a mission succeed?</p><p>
    
    I'm not sure how he did it.  There's a glimmer of hope in the open restraint of ""Choking You"", a sawtooth
    shuffle scattered with chirpy, chalky bits.  Another late track calls a gender truce, as a skeletal crunch
    frames some lightly doctored female vocals, giving a cold, sweet impression, like melon rinds left out in
    the rain.  And the last track, in spite of its metric and sexual duplicity, offers a baffling promise of
    balance.  Unexpectedly, the music becomes its own consolation.</p></div>"|6449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6449-one-word-extinguisher/|9.1|Jascha Hoffman

    of their post-rock experimentation has also come with a nice, fat helping of jazz heart, thus infusing sparse,
    synthesized, electro-acoustic tunes with a shot of emotional credibility.  To lose this-- to ditch the
    genuine, spiritual inspiration that actually makes music a feasible artform-- would be, in a certain sense,
    to render their music useless.</p><p>
    
    There's something uncomfortably sterile about The Sea and Cake's new, seven-song <i>Glass</i> EP that
    precludes it from functioning emotionally, and music that operates exclusively on an intellectual level
    seems counterintuitive.  Synthesized and aggressively antiseptic, this stuff just makes me nervous-- I
    can't conceive of a single viable situation in which somebody would stumble home, pour a bowl of cereal,
    take off their pants, and say, ""Man, I just really need to hear some of that effin' <i>Glass</i> EP right
    now.""  It's hardly unreasonable to crave something that makes your eyes roll back in your head, even if
    just for a few measures; it's far from irrational to require something you can holler at, or, at the very
    least, exchange satisfying pleasantries with.</p><p>
    
    There's nothing to grab onto here, though-- no obliging space for eager, sweaty fans to curl up in, no
    craggy, emotional scraps to latch onto and savor, no telling finger slips or screwed up instrumentation,
    no gasps for air, no poignant leaps.  None of the smelly, awkward, human stuff that really wets everyone's
    pants. This is expertly assembled music, but it's also impossible not to miss (and fair to demand!) the raw,
    reeling, otherworldly passion that can, and will, make even the most electronic of albums cry real, salty,
    face-streaking tears.</p><p>
    
    The plastic-wrapped bleakness is most evident on the two opening tracks, ""To the Author (Version 1)"" and
    ""To the Author (Version 2).""  Even the titles are telling-- I don't know what kind of man-machine these
    tunes were scribed for, but it sure as shit wasn't me.  Each seems more a self-indulgent experiment in sound
    than a labor of love or cathartic burst of inspiration, and even with that complaint aside, they're pretty
    much the same song: there are beeps in different places, structural reconsiderations, and some notable
    rhythmic switches, but the two still aren't distinct enough to warrant their cold, parenthetical qualifiers.
    Offering actual, numbered options only makes the songs themselves seem painfully arbitrary: there's no blood
    pooling on the studio floor here, no clear narrative path, no instinctual reactions or gnashing teeth.  The
    two tracks are artful collages, made from clean bits of actual and/or synthesized sound, and, at some point
    in the pasting process, the songs also became entirely devoid of greasy human fingerprints, functioning like
    math equations, fractals, patterns: anti-engaging, chillingly definite, and frankly, a bit boring.</p><p>
    
    Sure, there are some wacky waves of synth and an expert, snaking guitar line (with ever-nimble Tortoise-alum
    John McEntire banging out some brilliantly counterpoint drumbeats), but they don't add up to any logical
    conclusion or soulful epiphany-- just a big, shiny robot-face staring blankly back.  On Version 2, when
    Sam Prekop's breathy, limited coo blows up nearly five minutes in, the sudden and unexpected presence of
    something vulnerable and non-metallic is intensely comforting-- it's like being tugged out of an avalanche
    by one of those furry dogs with a tube of hot cocoa tied around its neck.</p><p>
    
    Remixes only work when they crack open the casing and rewire some circuitry, re-thinking the process and
    the story.  But again, The Sea and Cake seem to be unfairly shying away from their creative responsibilities
    here, opting for hedonistic experimentation over honest, genuine output.  It's fine for those happy to throw
    on the disc and do something else (like use their graphing calculator), but if you're looking for music to
    really <i>listen</i> to-- the kind of music that The Sea and Cake are better suited to producing-- just
    skip ahead to the third track, ""Traditional Wax Coin"", a piano-driven instrumental jaunt with all kinds
    of compelling tricks and some wildly good jazz drums, or ""An Echo In"", the last new track on <i>Glass</i>,
    a contemplative guitar jaunt with fuzzy bass and euphoric vocals.  Even ""Interiors"" and ""Hotel Tell"" (each
    culled from 2002's full-length <i>One Bedroom</i>, and re-interpreted here by Broadcast and Carl Craig,
    respectively) toy with some workable emotion: on ""Hotel Tell"", Prekop's singing is certifiably inspired
    (if a little strained), and Eric Claridge's bouncing bassline is genuinely charming.  It's getting warmer
    in here, boys.  Johnny 5 is alive!</p></div>"|7042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7042-glass-ep/|5.3|Amanda Petrusich

    experimentation, bands who kick't the spastic histrionics full-on ended up collecting an unfair amount of
    comparisons to that there ubiquitous Providence, RI-based drum + bass duo. Lightning Bolt are good, but the
    unschooled folks trying to explain 'em aren't: LB are barely the tip of a vast, complex aesthetic, certainly
    not as anomalous or out-of-nowhere as the powers that be would have you think.</p><p>
    I'm all up in arms, in my half-assed way, because I've seen and heard Hot Cross compared to Lightning Bolt.
    So lame! Such ridiculousness! A comparison like that not only strikes me as completely naïve, it denies the
    existence of hardcore! So why be a hardcore denier?  Well, uh, because hardcore has a fucking mile-long list
    of bad connotations. (The straightedge kids nod in fatuous agreement, tripping o'er their pants as they reach
    for their Big Gulp). Once ""the kids"" more outwardly turned into jocks and suburban squares (the shit was, for
    a time, latent in their souls), it got much cooler to call hardcore something else: post this or that, new
    metal, jagged whatever.  Even the Hot Cross press kit avoids the term, opting instead for ""technical-punk-metal.""
    Nope, son, this is hardcore!</p><p>
    Genre is as genre does. I grew up listening to hardcore and I partially accept its glaring shortcomings like
    I grudgingly accept the neuroses of my family. With that in mind, when I listen to Hot Cross they definitely
    win points for:</p><p>
    A. Not having even a single vocalist who sounds like Cookie Monster.<br/>
    B. Lyrics that aren't just a bunch of strung-together cliches about the
    scene and ""dead"" friends.<br/>
    C. Offering dynamics beyond a requisite hardcore breakdown, the one where
    the kids punch the floor or tap their chests and stare at the ceiling.<br/>
    D. Having graphic design sense.<br/>
    E. Being out of high school.</p><p>
    Hot Cross are a good hardcore band. A good band, period. Intrepid tour companions of Melt-Banana, they formed
    in 2001 when Level-Plane owner Greg Drudy decided to hit the skins again. He played drums in the screamy band
    Saetia and was also the original drummer for Interpol (no shit!). With hardcore on the mind, he gathered some
    friends together-- including ex-members of Neil Perry, Off Minor, and You and I-- and that's Hot Cross. The
    band's secret weapon, and the reason I want to listen to this record so often: three vocalists shouting and
    singing in different registers, bullets ricocheting throughout a metal room. The vocal trio thing not only
    works well to propel the songs into interesting territories-- the reliance on human voices to raise mine
    soul transforms Hot Cross into a rabid version of a boy band.</p><p>
    ""Fortune Teller"" reminds me of Small Brown Bike or maybe heavier Christie Front Drive: melodic voice in one
    speaker, screamer in the other, someone all up in a hissy fit elsewhere. The chant of ""fuck not lest ye be
    fucked"" is repeated until it grows-- like a hardcore snowball! monsoon!-- into a crackling, side-splitting
    acapella. If only I knew what it meant. This approach is also evident on ""Pretty Picture of a Broken Face"",
    where an almost e-m-o sigh clashes with distant screaming and a more upfront shout.</p><p>
    Wisely, Hot Cross aren't afraid of straddling genres. ""Patience and Prudence"" is sad like the metal dirges
    of old (think Metallica), but then there's some CHUGGA guitar to lift your spirits, too. ""Figure Eight"" is
    unremarkable, but almost country. (Well, at least the guitars.) While listening to it, I thought of Team
    Dresch's ""Freewheel"" and remembered what a good band they were.</p><p>
    It's only when Hot Cross get overly hardcore-- over-identifying with the less exciting aspects of the
    monster-- that I grow kinda weary. This happened now and again. ""A Weekend Spent Askance"" and ""Dissertation:
    14"" are indistinguishable and chock full o' yawns.  To their credit, even during these otherwise duds, there
    are brief lyrical gems (""Forget the phony fuck that thinks with an ass instead of a head"") or tiny flourishes
    like a wailing flange, an undistorted guitar, ringing noise sped up and slowed down, radio hiss, and/or an
    almost reggae dub.</p><p>
    Overall, <i>Cryonics</i> is an intense if sometimes average ride. More importantly to the thesis, though,
    Hot Cross aren't post-metal or pre-primitive this or blah blah that or whatever the fuck; they're basically
    what true-blue hardcore sounds like after having interestingly evolved. Put on your hoodies, kids!</p></div>"|3925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3925-cryonics/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

    importance to the development of jazz.  Tracing the evolution of those ensembles from leaders of funeral
    processions to whorehouse accompanists to their ultimate destination up the Mississippi River is the
    cornerstone from which any understanding of post-Depression Era music is derived.  From there, any number
    of paths are possible-- with the right map you can get to John Coltrane, Jimi Hendrix or Jay-Z-- but without
    that foundation there's little chance of meaningful academic travel, not to mention bagging anything higher
    than a C.</p><p>
    
    Too didactic?  Probably, but that's what listening to Madison, Wisconsin's Youngblood Brass Band is like--
    not only do they prefigure that people don't know anything about the history of Black Music and the links
    between jazz and hip-hop, but they also assume that folks don't know much of anything at all.  Maybe it's
    a result of the band members' doubling as teachers in their spare time, but I can't help but feel beat over
    the head with a social justice/""know your history"" party line that's far more elaborate than the music
    itself.</p><p>
    
    Youngblood Brass Band is nine players strong, but two of them can be held accountable for the one-dimensional
    mess that is <em>Center:Level:Roar</em>: composer/sousaphonist Nat McIntosh and emcee/snare-drummer David
    Henzie-Skogen.  McIntosh's charts admirably attempt to erode the lines separating big band polyphony and
    breakbeat rhythm, but his lack of compositional dynamics causes the band to blare along at a brutal decibel
    level-- a sound that's way more Maynard Ferguson than Stetsasonic.  In fact, the only track on the entire
    disc that makes me rethink my initial impulse to send them a complimentary case of Harmon mutes is the
    instrumental ""Nate McCavish Handbills for No Man"", where the Youngblood horns do a striking IDM impersonation
    with the help of some electronic effects.</p><p>
    
    McIntosh's weaknesses might be open to rehabilitation, but Henzie-Skogen's rapping is just downright
    inexcusable.  Where the strides made by underground hip-hop have opened up any number of possibilities for
    non-traditional flows, cadences and lyrical approaches, Henzie-Skogen doesn't even measure up under that
    expanded criteria.  When not shouting out distorted song titles Zack de la Rocha-style (""The Movement"",
    ""Avalanche""), he's playing the social consciousness card with all the skills of a poor man's Talib Kweli--
    who, incidentally, guests on a recent non-album Youngbloods single to prove that not even a top-notch emcee
    can lead them to the next level.  But where Kweli backs up his bold observations with one of the best voices
    in contemporary hip-hop, Henzie-Skogen is all words and no tone; a combination that's bound to alienate more
    potential sympathizers to the cause than it recruits.</p><p>
    
    I really do wish these guys had pulled this together more successfully, because, in theory, I still think
    it's a good idea that could withstand further exploration, especially since The Roots have almost entirely
    abandoned the jazzbo tip from whence they came.  But the Youngbloods' good intentions are beyond compromised
    for now by a limited vision that effectively reduces them to a high school pep band trying to be down with
    the hip-hop kids-- only to reveal themselves for the cheerleaders they truly are.</p></div>"|8848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8848-centerlevelroar/|3.4|Scott Hreha

His
    career in music closely paralleled the ascendancy of the ""glitch"" in the late 90s, and by the time he made
    his third-straight record of crackly, bass-driven ghostdub, people started wondering where he could possibly
    go next. He sidestepped the issue in 2001 by releasing the underrated and under-promoted <i>R</i>, which
    compiled some early 12-inches with significant remixes and re-recordings of same, including particularly
    fruitful collaborations with guitarist D. Meteo. These collaborations were key, because they showed that the
    formerly hermetic Betke was open to trying something new; <i>R</i> was further notable for skimming off some
    of the sonic fuzz.  Betke's label ~scape continued to put out some excellent records, but the question
    lingered: what would he come with on his next Pole record?</p><p>
    
    Well, 2003 promises to be an interesting year for Stefan Betke. As introduced on the four-track <i>45/45</i>
    EP, he's changed his sound considerably.  Tired of his own fingerprints-- indeed, the glitch movement in
    general-- this EP almost sounds like a debut from a new artist.  Certain distinct Pole elements are intact--
    mantle-shaking basslines, dub references (here in the form of melodica leads), a preoccupation with space--
    but the production on these four tracks couldn't be more clean, and the rhythmic inspiration comes from well
    North of Jamaica. Like it or not, this is a new Pole.</p><p>
    
    And for the most part, I like it.  This particular sound is much more welcome than a further refinement of
    the blue, red, yellow progression would be. Starting off the record, ""Arena"" takes its syncopated rhythm
    directly from hip-hop, and this time the drums are loud and clear as opposed to being hinted at by the use
    of negative space (the latter was something Betke had a genius for).  The Pabloesque melodica figures impart
    an island ambience and bits of chicken-scratch guitar form a pencil-thin riff, but the production is brittle
    and dry, nothing like the reverb-heavy syrup dub is usually coated with. ""Round Two"" is a slightly moodier
    and subtler reshuffling of the same ingredients, with the addition of some bell tones and more familiar
    Pole chords.</p><p>
    
    ""The Bell"" is a bit of a letdown. Like ""Arena"" and ""Round Two"" it will appear again on the forthcoming
    <i>Pole</i> full-length in a vocal version, with some rhymes (!) courtesy of Mush Records emcee Fat Jon,
    but ""The Bell"" is the only one of the three that sounds incomplete as an instrumental. It is so unbelievably
    spare, with interesting percussion but almost nothing happening melodically, and it just sort of loops over
    and over until it's finished.  Fortunately, <i>45/45</i> ends with ""Back Home"", which is the best thing we've
    heard from Pole for some time. The track is built around a sparkling surge of digital energy that strikes me
    as being inspired by ~scape's Jan Jelinek (there's a glow to the chord texture that Jelinek would be proud
    of), and it also features some funky acoustic bass work by August Engkilde.</p><p>
    
    Betke titled this EP to reflect his shift in direction (a 45-degree turn), and that angle might be a bit
    conservative. You can still tell it's the same guy, but barely, and almost as importantly, <i>45/45</i>
    doesn't sound like anyone else; Pole imitators have become legion, and Betke has signed a few of them.
    For his own career, this is an interesting first step into new territory, a statement of intent.</p></div>"|6374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6374-4545-ep/|6.8|Mark Richardson

Really, Howe Gelb shouldn't be making music this enjoyable, not with that voice
    of his.  Gelb's larynx commands a staunchly unmelodic rasp, hovering in a range that's obviously too low for
    his natural delivery.  And the perverse thing about it is, I think he does it on purpose-- his past records
    with Giant Sand (and there are a lot of them) suggest he has quite a range, though one unifying principle
    remains in place on every one of his albums: he studiously avoids sounding polished and professional.</p><p>
    
    Part of what makes it work is his sense of humor, which frequently permeates his records.  His songs often
    contain the kinds of jokes you get the second or third time around, and his delivery is occasionally part of
    the punchline.  Gelb's latest solo record-- arriving more than two decades after his first release with
    Giant Sand precursor Giant Sandworms-- is a casual, good-natured romp recorded in Denmark and Arizona,
    stuffed full of cabaret, porch jazz and slacker noir, furthering Gelb's recent trend away from the
    idiosyncratic desert blues-rock on which Giant Sand initially built their cult following.</p><p>
    
    Gelb hooks you with his liner notes before the album even starts, penning a hugely successful and
    entertaining prank diary, wherein he's been hired to research the ""actions and displays of modern thinkers""
    by a company that makes custom-sized rivets for Airstream trailers.  To get close to his people, he decides
    to become a ""cult artist,"" and there's a passage that so positively slays the indie rock scene (and his own
    past) that I have to repeat it in full here:</p><p>
<i>""First, a lack of proficiency on any instrument of choice;<br/>
    This would allow a more unique style to emerge from the playing.<br/>
    Second, a definite omission of melody in the material;<br/>
    This made it even easier to qualify to such status.<br/>
    And thirdly, a demeanor of abandon;<br/>
    A reckless execution mixed with an offhanded delivery with too much wordplay.""</i></p><p>
    
    The whole notion that he attained cult status in the underground specifically to aid the process of selling
    out is icing on the cake.  Of course, this is a guy who labored in obscurity for decades, never really
    receiving the kind of attention that most upstart bands receive after a month in the Brooklyn club scene
    these days, so he's entitled to get his licks in.  That he carries this spirit into the music is a pleasure
    for the listener.</p><p>
    
    ""Felonious"", in particular, reveals his piano bar jokester side, blatantly copping the riff from ""Sweet
    Jane"" for the piano part then admitting it with the opening line, ""The piano's stealing Lou Reed licks/
    Licks that he probably stole.""  The whole thing unfolds in ramshackle widescreen ambience, with Calexico
    (themselves Giant Sand alums) functioning as the house band, and swelling strings offering offhandedly
    pretty melodic accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    The Danish tracks-- featuring assorted Danish scenesters and a backing band called Under Byen-- reside in a
    realm of demented jazz, where tension builds and resolves in unexpected ways, and the tango is anything but
    elegant.  Peter Dombernowsky's hand percussion is the driving rhythmic force on these tracks, and the smears
    of classically trained violin and drunken sax that Under Byen provide render things rudely off color.  ""B 4
    U (Do Do Do)"" brutally butchers Bill Withers' ""Lean on Me"" over a backdrop that could only be called rock
    in the loosest possible sense-- which is not to say it's good, though it is strangely captivating.</p><p>
<i>The Listener</i> is ultimately such a strange record that it's hard to really classify; Giant Sand fans
    are going to love it, naturally (all twelve of them likely already own it), but people new to Gelb and his
    accomplices might be left scratching their heads.  Gelb's work is ultimately difficult to approach without
    simply diving in cold, and with that in mind, this album is probably as good a place to start as any (I
    might recommend Giant Sand's <i>Purge &amp; Slouch</i>, <i>Glum</i>, or <i>Chore of Enchantment</i> first,
    but they're all similarly whacked).  As a slow convert to Gelb's world myself, I know his stuff's not for
    everybody, but I have to say it's worth a try for anyone with a wide open ear and a sense of humor.</p></div>"|3417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3417-the-listener/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    the feeling that I's about to discover a frumpy diamond or a low-key giant, some music that would give pause
    to self-mutilating goth tweens and soothe insomniacs learning Latin to improve their tattoos. Maybe I got
    wooed by their fourth album's portentous cover art-- a photorealistic painting of a hole in a stormcloud
    over a body of water that had me convinced that there was a God, and a God's butthole. Alas, this
    underwhelming ""long player"" (on my property, 7 songs in 24 minutes is called an EP) teaches us why Birddog
    are best known for an alumnus (they're the farm team from which Wilco recruited Glenn Kotche) and their
    guestlist (Elliott Smith and Edith Frost on their last record, Jason Loewenstein and Paul Oldham on this
    one).</p><p>
    
    As a band, Birddog acquits itself as a delivery system for moody, mystic-toned neo-folk, and the presence of
    onetime Bonnie ""Prince"" sidemen Loewenstein and Oldham help to hint at a more streamlined Palace sound, what
    <i>Joya</i> should have sounded like were it rehearsed or produced worth a durn. These unconventionally or
    at least atypically alluring figures are a perfect match for frontman Bill Santen's faux Brit/psych
    enunciations (""night"" is ""noi-eye-ght"") that suggest a whimsical, but slightly disturbed, mid-60s mix of
    Donovan, Neil Young, and fruity pebbled Arthur Lee. (Okay, it's David Byrne as Peter Pan.) (Okay, it's The
    Vehicle Flips versus The Lightning Seeds, but slow-burn.)</p><p>
    
    Santen's fey and elfin self pens lyrics about not-much that rhyme-or-don't. Their dilly-dallying begs for
    some antonym of ""urgent,"" and their occasional bad poetry is saved by the occasional great line such as,
    ""Hoping for a hooker or a handout.""  This is from ""Cities"", which busts into a righteous artwad-Skynyrd
    riff. ""Red Red Wine"" is a brooding Lynchian antifable about needles and devils, its forlorn bridges pointing
    out what a markedly unfestive departure it is from the other song you know by its name. ""Beaches"" ain't got
    aerosol do to with Bette Midler or the breeze under anybody's featherflaps, but it is the band's poppiest
    peak, refraining, ""Without you/ Without you.""  Still, a pop Birddog is like The Wallflowers if they were on
    Shimmy-Disc.</p><p>
    
    ""$100 Wedding"" can't help but sum up this band's vibe: low-maintenance, sparsely attended ceremony. There's
    something admirable about how this band waves no cudgel, doesn't appear to be aiming for its audience's
    memory, and probably doesn't mind still bumping like an opening act after eight years. This disc makes for
    inoffensive incidental music, and that's no faint-praise write-off: their sound is shyly expansive rather
    than invasive. But damnit, I was on the prowl for a new unsung visionary, and <i>Songs from Willipa Bay</i>
    just reminds me of another Washington waterway: Cape Disappointment.</p></div>"|715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/715-songs-from-willipa-bay/|6.0|William Bowers

Now, some of these bands are
    great at what they do-- if we were ever to eventually discover the wheel, after all, you can bet it would
    be the roundest goddamned wheel humanity had ever known-- but tail-chasing can only go so far.  So in
    hindsight, is it that surprising that Wire's two <i>Read &amp; Burn</i> EPs from last year marked such a
    successful return after a decade-long hiatus?  Simultaneously resisting the cop-out of cannibalizing the
    sound of their classic late-70s material, and dodging any self-conscious stab at avant-garde, Wire sound
    nearly as essential now as they ever have.  Who ever said comebacks were tough?  All it takes is a
    preternatural sense of musical trends and history, a cunning knack for timing, and the willingness to
    completely reinvent yourself.</p><p>
    
    So what the Hell is this, Colin?  Bruce?  <i>Send</i>?  Here I am, doing my best to talk up Wire's tireless
    desire to innovate (which, regardless of any lingering ambivalence to the merit of their 80s output, is
    near-indisputable), and you guys go and release this in lieu of the anticipated <i>Read &amp; Burn 03</i>
    installment.  Concealing a scant four new tracks in the midst of just above half the material from the
    prior two EPs, <i>Send</i> feels a little, uh, unnecessary.  The album fails to even meaningfully compile
    <i>01</i> and <i>02</i>, ditching some of those discs' most potent buzz-punk tracks, instead replacing them
    with a couple of stiff, diluted cuts that surely wouldn't be equipped to stand on their own.  In a bizarre
    twist, the whole becomes far less than the sum of its parts; less than anything close to a new album, less
    than even a new EP, and certainly less than Wire has proven themselves capable of.</p><p>
    
    That said, this record could only be seen as a false move in comparison to the standards they've so
    brilliantly set for themselves; in isolation, <i>Send</i> still possesses much of the fury, malevolence,
    and crushing immediacy that had all the kids talking about them again in the present tense.  The martial
    anthems reprised here are no less vicious for sitting on the shelf a year; the guttural bile-spitting,
    robo-hypnotic snare simplicity, and guitars as head-rattlingly violent as a boxing match between a power
    sander and a jackhammer-- it's all as sharp as ever.</p><p>
    
    Those who've yet to know the power of the new EPs will marvel at the subliminal paranoia of ""Nice Streets
    Above"" or rapid-fire metal blast of ""Comet"".  These folks may also take some comfort in the vintage
    melody-making of ""The Art of Stopping"", though the sheer authority of Bruce Gilbert's speak-shouts and the
    grinding waves of feedback on ""Spent"" will humble them.  The content of Gilbert's barking is unclear beyond
    keeping the drive alive, but that's not important-- his tone is crystal, and it demands obedience.</p><p>
    
    In truth, anyone who's enjoyed the <i>Read &amp; Burn</i> series to date will probably be awed by all that stuff,
    too-- the only difference is the slight, bitter pang of regret they'll experience when the gradual eruption
    of <i>Send</i>'s (and <i>02</i>'s) epic closer ""99.9"" quiets, and they wake to the realization that ""Raft
    Ants"" and ""Trash/Treasure"", the finest moments on <i>02</i>, are nowhere to be found on the album's tracklist.
    Sadder still, the new material left in their stead just twists the knife.  The dull claustrophobia of ""Being
    Watched"" and the even duller ""Half Eaten"", a brief, pounding instrumental that might as well be ""Raft Ants
    Lite""-- all the repetition, half the nuance-- shouldn't have made the cut.  Neither track is particularly
    objectionable, but that does little to remedy the fact that better songs were sidelined for them.</p><p>
    
    The other two fresh cuts take up some of the slack, for what it's worth.  The ominous, confrontational tone
    of ""You Can't Leave Now"" slows <i>Send</i> to a crawl before a distorted, beatific refrain offers momentary
    redemption, but the only truly impressive addition to this album is ""Mr. Marx's Table"".  Colin Newman's voice
    is carefully, gracefully restrained, distorted just enough to be slightly rendered unclear; it offers mystery
    and an uncertain happiness even as he admits (or informs) that ""It's too late to pray.""  It's a beautiful
    counterpoint to the vague malaise that hangs over not only the pulsing guitar drone that accompanies it, but
    the rest of the album, too, standing in particularly strong relief against the largely limp new offerings.</p><p>
    
    If <i>Send</i> is to be your only exposure to these guys this century (so far), it's worth it-- even though
    they've outdone themselves at pretty much the same album in the past couple of months.  Wire's proven not
    once, but twice, that they'd rather disappear entirely than even consider doubling back on themselves, but
    nevertheless, after thirty-odd years of barreling forward, this is, if not a step backwards, something
    equally alien: a hesitation.</p></div>"|8710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8710-send/|7.5|Eric Carr

The term is usually reserved
    for one-off vanity projects by famous people with too much time on their hands.  And besides, the results of
    the supergroup collaboration are almost invariably doomed to be regarded as secondary and inconsequential.
    If David Lee Roth, Keanu Reeves, and the Olsen Twins made an album together, it would not only be a surefire
    sign that Earth had finally become a true Gomorrah, but also would undoubtedly fail to generate the revenues
    and public acclaim of Van Halen's <i>1984</i>, <i>The Matrix</i>, or the July 2006 issue of <i>Hustler</i>.</p><p>
    
    It seems odd, then, that a pack of talented but largely overlooked Canadians and one up-and-coming,
    Canadian-by-way-of-Virginia alt-country chanteuse would come to be spoken of as if they were indie rock's
    answer to The Traveling Wilburys.  But listening to The New Pornographers' stunning debut, <i>Mass Romantic</i>,
    the term ""supergroup"" seems surprisingly fitting, if not in the traditional sense of the word.  Certainly,
    <i>Mass Romantic</i> was as far from an insubstantial vanity project as one can imagine-- but, just as
    certainly, it doesn't sound like the product of just some average, run-of-the-mill ""group.""</p><p>
    
    That record was the result of years of sporadic tinkering by a rotating cast of insanely talented individuals.
    Each song seemed to showcase a different permutation of the members' talents, and registered like a perfectly
    constructed sonic artifact, rather than just a recording of some people playing their instruments in a room.
    Since its release, the Pornographers have become the main project for primary songwriter Carl Newman, bassist
    John Collins, keyboardist Blaine Thurier, drummer Kurt Dahle, and recently acquired multi-instrumentalist
    Todd Fancey.  The band has toured extensively, and over the past two years, written and recorded this, their
    sophomore album.  In other words, The New Pornographers have become a real band.</p><p>
    
    Accordingly, the most substantial difference between <i>Mass Romantic</i> and <i>Electric Version</i> is that
    the latter sounds much more like an album by a band than a collective.  On <i>Mass Romantic</i>, every sonic
    nook and cranny was filled by a whirring synthesizer, a buzzing acoustic guitar, or a five-part harmony vocal.
    <i>Electric Version</i>, on the other hand, is a much more live-sounding and spacious record, with instrumentation
    kept relatively straightforward and a minimum of evident studio embellishments.  And yet, The New Pornographers
    have retained their signature sound-- in short, <i>Electric Version</i> is a more streamlined and spontaneous
    incarnation of the same catchy, harmony-laden power-pop that provided the foundation for <i>Mass Romantic</i>.</p><p>
    
    Even more so than <i>Mass Romantic</i>, <i>Electric Version</i> sounds like Carl Newman's record.  The
    frenetic-verse-and-anthemic-chorus formula that Newman toyed with last time around constitutes the core of
    this record, and provides the format for some of its greatest moments, but also a few of its most forgettable.
    ""The End of Medicine"", which was included as a B-side on the ""Letter from an Occupant"" single, gets a
    fantastic reworking here, as Newman turns a fragile vocal hook into the centerpiece for a perfectly concise
    pop gem.  On ""July Jones"", Newman inflects his bouncy, melodic songwriting with a kind of reflective
    melancholy that <i>Mass Romantic</i> never even hinted at, with absolutely gorgeous results.  In fact, the
    more spacious sound of <i>Electric Version</i> allows for <i>a lot</i> of low-key moments that <i>Mass
    Romantic</i> simply didn't have room for: ""From Blown Speakers"", another standout, subtly develops to a
    powerful and bittersweet finale, weaving the threads of nostalgia that run throughout the song into a
    shimmering coda.</p><p>
    
    As was the case with <i>Mass Romantic</i>, Newman makes some of his most powerful statements on <i>Electric
    Version</i> through the silvery pipes of Neko Case.  ""The Laws Have Changed"", in which Case and Newman trade
    off lead vocals, may very well be the best song here.  Hooks within hooks are exchanged between the two
    singers, and the contrast between Newman's smirking disaffection and Case's effortless resonance is played
    up to great effect.</p><p>
    
    Since 2000, Dan Bejar has amicably given up his position as a full-time member of the band.  Nevertheless,
    he's offered three contributions to <i>Electric Version</i>, and they're absolutely superb, as his obtuse,
    nonlinear songwriting provides a welcome counterpoint to Newman's classicist leanings.  On ""Chump Change"",
    Newman's power-pop machine turns a typical Bejar ditty into a chugging anthem, effortlessly transforming a
    line like ""the saints and the desert use their heads"" from an abstract lyrical nugget into one of the most
    indelible hooks on the record.  ""Testament to Youth in Verse"", Bejar's best on <i>Electric Version</i>, is
    host to a two-minute vocal round coda that really has to be heard to be believed.</p><p>
    
    Of course, strong though it may be, <i>Electric Version</i> is not without its low points.  Sometimes
    Newman's propensity for writing verses crammed full of chord changes works against him, especially when
    such verses fail to effectively segue into a rousing chorus.  Those expecting the dense, powerful, and
    insistently upbeat onslaught of <i>Mass Romantic</i> will no doubt react to <i>Electric Version</i> with
    some degree of initial disappointment.  Repeated listens, however, reveal that <i>Electric Version</i>
    not only displays Carl Newman's brilliant and unique pop sensibility, but allows it enough space to reveal
    previously obstructed layers of emotional depth.  Indeed, the overall success of this record suggests that
    The New Pornographers are anything but a one-off project; with any luck, it will mark the beginning of
    the band's metamorphosis from ""supergroup"" to, simply, ""great band.""</p></div>"|5772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5772-electric-version/|8.1|Matt LeMay

    has always had its share of satirical acts.  Take The Dead Milkmen, The Dead Kennedys, or They Might Be
    Giants-- who had a really good song called ""Dead""-- or browse the single-syllable branch, with representatives
    like Devo, Ween, and Cex.  It's not much of a stretch to assume that Atom &amp; His Package imagines himself a
    part of this genetic lineage, but his true mentor seems to be a comedy-rock star that shines a bit more
    brightly: parody king ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.</p><p>
    Now, far be it from me to front on The Al-- after all, I was an eleven year-old boy once.  In fact, I still
    have an autographed ticket stub from a Weird Al show, a performance at a dinner theater at which I saw my
    first ever moshers during ""Smells Like Nirvana"".  You might even say Al played a formative role in my
    musical development.  No, let's not say that.</p><p>
    Unlike me, Adam Goren doesn't seem like he'd be too ashamed by the comparison.  He's got the nostril-heavy
    vocals, he occasionally borrows a melody or two from the pop culture consciousness, and instead of an
    accordion, he's got the sequencer companion he calls His Package (clearly a statement on the technologicalization
    of sexual organs in our increasingly impersonal and technical lives.  Or just a cheap laugh).  He might avoid
    overt song parodies, but that was only half of the Yankovic catalog: the rest of his albums were filled out
    with, er, classics like ""Nature Trail to Hell (In 3-D)"".</p><p>
    On <i>Attention! Blah Blah Blah</i>, however, Goren is doing stand-up, with pretty limp material.  Here's a
    song about marrying your grandma!  Hey-o!  Here's a song about why Atom doesn't want to have kids!  Here's
    a song about smashing things with a hammer!  I'm not totally averse to humor in music, but these jokes are
    sitcom-bad, and especially disappointing given that Atom has been reasonably funny in the past: the way
    ""Punk Rock Academy"" inexplicably becomes an Eddie Money cover halfway through, or the spot-on, caffeinated,
    Le Tigre-referencing rant of ""If You Own the Washington Redskins, You're a Cock"".</p><p>
    The closest to thing to ""If You Own the Washington Redskins"" on <i>Attention</i> is ""The Palestinians Are
    Not the Same Thing as the Rebel Alliance, Jackass"", which never gets funnier than that doozy of a title
    right there.  Two minutes of breakneck-speed anti-war protestor mockery that scores a couple valid points,
    it falls flat as satire, and Atom can't help but cut himself with double-edged statements like, ""You people
    who generalize are all the same!""</p><p>
    Compounding these problems, <i>Attention</i> shows Atom &amp; His Package isn't even as musically compelling as
    he's been on previous outing, and he wasn't all that compelling to begin with.  Where Goren once offered up
    a welcome slice of synthy levity between bands at a thousand over-serious emo shows, he now sounds like he's
    auditioning for the next Blink-182 tour, coating nearly every song with crunchy pop-punk guitar glaze.
    Capable, not-quite-Postal Service moments of programming-- the pizzicato strings of ""Friend, Please Stop
    Smoking"" or the epileptic rhythms of ""Possession (Not the One by Danzig)""-- are lost beneath the Nü-Weezer
    metal riffing.</p><p>
    The sad fact is, a project like Atom &amp; His Package suffers from the They Might Be Giants quandary: the more
    it sounds like a real band, and the more it takes itself seriously, the worse it becomes.  Essentially, this
    means Atom &amp; His Package is painted into a corner of stagnation, doomed to repeat himself with the musical
    editorials and danced-up Mountain Goats covers that got him this far.  But hey, chin up, Atom-- doing the
    same thing over and over again has given ""Weird Al"" Yankovic a long, virtuous career and a killer episode
    of <i>Behind the Music</i>-- you could be next!</p></div>"|347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/347-attention-blah-blah-blah/|3.8|Rob Mitchum

    our time. From Portishead to Beth Orton, the sultry lady of yore has grown electronic-savvy and more powerful,
    while still emitting a hella-tragic, star-crossed and/or doomed existence via her breathy, lilting voice.
    Australian-now-Chicagoan Tania Bowers sings with an extraordinarily breezy, half-lidded and dreamy timbre--
    a cooing, shivering, meowing tendril of a voice; you can picture her lying on the ground with the back of
    her hand pressed to her forehead, tragically, like a dying 30s actress, bow-lipped and spidery-eyelashed in
    the burning sunlight. (Okay, a little more subtle than that, maybe, but you get the picture.)</p><p>
<i>Under a Different Sky</i> is Via Tania's first proper full-length, following a six-song EP and a twelve-inch
    for <i>Different Sky</i>'s ""Lightning &amp; Thunder"" (which included a pretty decent, depressive cover of New
    Order's ""Temptation"").  Check out the list of indie-famous friends who helped her make it: Scott Herren
    (Prefuse 73), Doug McCombs (Tortoise), John Herndon (Tortoise), Howe Gelb (Giant Sand), Wayne Montana
    (Trenchmouth), Chris Brokaw (Come), Noel Kupersmith (Chicago Underground, Brokeback), and her husband,
    producer/engineer Casey Rice, who's worked with Joan of Arc, Tortoise, and Liz Phair among many others.
    Based on that who's-who laundry list, you get a pretty good idea of what <i>Under a Different Sky</i> sounds
    like: a downtempo confetti of glitch, sweltering bass, isolated beats, and glimmers of synths and samples,
    as well as the sweet curlicue vocal rubdown of Tania Bowers.</p><p>
    
    But-- and here's the shocker-- it's not boring! It's actually very subdued and delicate, if never so delicate
    that you feel compelled to tiptoe around its frailty. The minimal instrumentation is pulsing with ethereal,
    watery flourishes, and gives you the dribbling, comforting sensation of being encased in a mold of warm
    strawberry gelatin. Bower's shivering voice operates much in the same way as the production: with tiny
    subtleties, vibratos, and inflections appearing for a brief second, never to return. It's a compelling mode
    for a torch singer, but often, her breathlessness traverses into a slightly asthmatic wheezing, and you're
    all, ""Baby, you gotta get that shit checked out."" It's a minor issue-- with this sort of atmospheric downtempo,
    you don't want Joan Jett barking over it-- but its lesser quality is amplified when she drops the
    self-conscious, wilting, airy thing and just belts it out seductively, as on the transfixing, guitar-heavy
    ""The River"", or the fire-invoking, jazzy nature of ""Boltanski"".</p><p>
    
    You could chalk up her labors to vocal experimentation and an effort to sound more profoundly wrought, but
    with the gossamer nature of the production, the music doesn't want for much else in the way of fragility.
    It mostly needs a slight bit of contrast, possibly in the form of Bowers' increased vocal confidence. With
    that, Via Tania will be a major contender in the sizzling future of passionate wraiths crooning dramatically
    into laptop mics across the world.</p></div>"|8459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8459-under-a-different-sky/|7.4|Julianne Shepherd

    out in Los Angeles, Brian Jones sucked a deep hit of kif and hopped a cab down the coast from Tangier to
    Larache with engineer George Chkiantz and girlfriend Suki in tow.  From Larache the group hiked halfway up
    a mountain to the village of Jajouka, where for ages masses of drummers pounded under a chorus of reed
    ripping <i>rhaita</i> players as part of the Bou Jeloud ritual dance.  Jones dreamed of expanding the Stones'
    sound beyond their American roots influence.  Easily bored, he'd already exhausted sitar, vibraphone,
    dulcimer, and ""the bloody marimbas"" (as Keith called them) two years earlier on <i>Aftermath</i>.</p><p>
    As Jones' health famously sagged along with the bags under his eyes, The Rolling Stones found less and less
    use for his experiments.  ""Moroccan drums"" pop up on ""Midnight Rambler"", but the band would never hike that
    mountain for the elusive Jajouka fusion.  That is, not until they mattered little, in the late 80s, for
    ""Continental Drift"", a cut hidden deep in the career nadir of <i>Steel Wheels</i>.  By then, looking to
    Africa for a muse had become AOR cliche, thanks to Paul Simon and Sting.  Even the derided Paul McCartney
    overcame bubblegum balladry for <i>Band on the Run</i>, recorded in Lagos amidst studio shortcomings and
    legendary knife-point muggings.</p><p>
    Which brings us to Blur and their long-developed <i>Think Tank</i>, recorded in Morocco without founding
    guitar icon Graham Coxon.  Rock 'n' roll precedent begs certain questions.  Will the loss of Coxon equate
    to the loss of Brian Jones (or Mick Taylor) or a hypothetical loss of Keith Richards?  Will <i>Think Tank</i>
    be another <i>Cut the Crap</i>, <i>The Final Cut</i>, <i>Dr. Byrds and Mr. Hyde</i>, Carl and the Passions
    (So Tough), <i>Good Stuff</i>, <i>And Then There Were Three</i>, <i>Wake of the Flood</i>, <i>Mag Earwig</i>,
    <i>Stranded</i>, <i>One Hot Minute</i>, <i>Face Dances</i>, <i>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</i>,

    of <i>Sticky Fingers</i>, <i>Back in Black</i>, <i>XTRMNTR</i>, <i>Adore</i>, <i>Up</i>, <i>In the Studio</i>,
    <i>Movement</i>, <i>Everything Must Go</i>, <i>Soft Bulletin</i>, <i>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</i>,
    <i>First Step</i>, <i>Damaged</i>, <i>Green Mind, </i><i>This Is Hardcore</i>, <i>Coming Up</i>, <i>Full
    House</i>, and <i>...And Justice for All</i>?</p><p>
    With the exception of a year back in 1995, Blur have never rested on their laurels.  Unlike their peers,
    they've delivered each album dipped in a drastic new element while keeping a consistent melodic heart.
    Albarn has always taken his shots, and thirteen years on seems to savor the challenge.  Take, for instance,
    2002's <i>Mali Music</i>, his rich, ethereal solo equivalent to Brian Jones' <i>The Pipes of Pan at Joujouka</i>:
    not content to simply document the musical heritage of the locals, Albarn stepped in alongside Afel Bocoum,
    protegé to Ali Farka Toure, humming his melodica during Niger-side jams and later reassembling the results
    in London as a montage of British-pop sensibilities with post-production special effects and punches of
    guitar, bass, and keyboard.  The ambience and dust of the Malian excursion settles heavily over <i>Think
    Tank</i>, and notably, Albarn seems to have picked up more guitar skills from Bocoum than Coxon.  The
    majestic, snaking ""Out of Time"" relies less on the lugubrious, Gibraltar-docked solo than the vast,
    four-dimensional environment surrounding it.  One gets the sense that even if Graham Coxon had caught the
    flight to Marrakesh, <i>Think Tank</i> wouldn't have turned out much different.</p><p>
    Of course, all this focus on Damon and Graham discredits Alex James and Dave Rowntree, who really push
    <i>Think Tank</i> through the sand.  The two both preempted the critics by perfectly describing the new
    music in interviews.  James claimed <i>Think Tank</i> ""has hips,"" while Rowntree simply said it's most
    similar to <i>Parklife</i>.  James goes the furthest in giving Blur hips, beyond often posing with his
    protruding-- with the focus off Coxon, his brilliant bass playing will finally be seen as the vital element
    in Blur.  It gave ""Girls and Boys"", ""Parklife"", ""Coffee and TV"", and ""Song 2"" their major hooks, while
    Graham hammered away on minimal riffs.  If you're air-playing anything along to those tracks, it's the
    air-bass you're wriggling your index and middle fingers to.  Likewise, <i>Think Tank</i> is laden with
    creative bass leads.</p><p>
    ""Brothers and Sisters"" pounds along like contemporary Primal Scream revisiting <i>Screamadelica</i>.  While
    Damon twists away like the Konda Bongo Man on guitar and hammers ""Rockit"" Hancock keyboard blurts, James
    freaks out like a Funkadelic foray into post-punk on ""Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club"".  Rowntree,
    meanwhile, switches between locking the beats into motorik molds or loosens them up into Bou Jeloud punk.
    But <i>Think Tank</i> is by no means ""Blur gone dance"" (ironically, the two Fatboy Slim songs, ""Crazy Beat""
    and ""Gene by Gene"", are, if anything, Clash-inspired)-- what was ""Girls and Boys"" but a disco rock track
    seven years before it was fashionable?  Even ""Battle"", ""People in Europe"", ""Death of a Party"", ""I'm Just a
    Killer for Your Love"", ""Entertain Me"", ""On Your Own"", and ""London Loves"" used loops or drum machines.</p><p>
    Incidentally, despite my earlier, tenuous attempts to link Blur to the Stones in some sort of sacred,
    afro-spiritual rock history, Blur worship more at the altar of Bowie.  The Bowie element has, of course,
    always been there, from ""Bugman"" to ""M.O.R.""-- the latter emulated <i>Lodger</i>'s ""Boys Keep Swinging"" to
    such an extent that Bowie was given songwriting credit.  Here it seems that Albarn must idolize <i>Lodger</i>,
    in particular, as <i>Think Tank</i> follows the overlooked album closely in spirit.  In ""Fantastic Voyage"",
    ""African Night Flight"", and ""Yassassin"", Bowie found a fractured, minimal sound affected by Middle Eastern
    and African music without blindly throwing a robe and bongo on while inviting Ladysmith Black Mambazo to
    sing.  In contrast ""DJ"" and ""Boys Keep Swinging"" offered jittery, pre-new wave dance-rock.</p><p>
<i>Combat Rock</i>, too, stands as an obvious parallel.  ""Car Jamming"", ""Straight to Hell"", and ""Overpowered
    by Funk"" inspire the most daring <i>Think Tank</i> tracks-- ""Me, White Noise"" (with Phil Daniels standing in
    for Ginsberg), ""Jets"", and ""Ambulance"".  But, ah, remember Dave Rowntree saying this was like <i>Parklife</i>.
    In basic sound, as you may have gathered, no.  <i>Parklife</i> was the defining BRITISH album of the 90s,
    ushering in an unintentional wave of newly patriotic blokes who failed to see it as satire, like ""Born in
    the U.S.A."" blaring at Reagan rallies.  Likewise, <i>Think Tank</i> sounds like Britain today-- a Britain
    where Panjabi MC's ""Mundian to Bach Ke"" and Audio Bully's ""We Don't Care"" outchart Athlete's modernized
    Britpop.  It sounds like Notting Hill, where American media-skewed preconceptions are both confirmed by the
    enormous white townhomes and shattered by the multi-ethnic markets.  Damon Albarn is more likely to find
    bootleg dancehall CDs spread across a Pakistani carpet outside his Honest Jon's Records shop than <i>Heathen
    Chemistry</i>.</p><p>
    Then again, <i>Think Tank</i> does sound like <i>Parklife</i>, as it contains Albarn's best ballads since.
    ""Sweet Song"" plucks an echoing piano and rusty guitar under a lake of pure, clear melody, and ""Caravan"" cracks
    like a last lament transmitted from an imploding submarine on crunchy sonar pulses and disintegrating guitar
    from a deep P.A. as Albarn announces, ""You'll feel the weight of it,"" before breaking the surface in
    dulcimer-drenched sunshine.  Oh, and Graham does pop up once, on ""Battery in Your Leg"", which opens sounding
    eerily similar to Eno and Bowie's Berlin output before Coxon makes his guitar twang like high tension wires
    snapping and erupts in Saturn-rocket blasts.</p><p>
    Like being plopped down in Morocco for the first time, or Covent Garden for that matter, <i>Think Tank</i>
    takes some reorienting.  To answer the questions posed earlier, the album is laughably miles better than
    every album on the first list, and surprisingly better than, or just as good as, every single one on the
    other.  But don't just judge it as an album by a band coming off a major line-up change.  You won't need to.</p></div>"|828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/828-think-tank/|9.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

Whether to your delight (DiCrescenzo)
    or your chagrin (a dude who likes them), the haywire Providence, RI quartet has called it quits after
    seven-plus years, dragging four full-lengths, four seven-inches, and four comp appearances in their wake.
    Misters Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Type A, Clinical Depression, and OCD are citing ""irreconcilable
    differences"" that have ""compromised the creative process""-- and just when their name was becoming en vogue!</p><p>
    
    San Diego's Three One G has gladly seized the reigns of the band's back catalog, and plans to reissue their
    first two albums, <i>Queen Hygiene II</i> and <i>Rough Day at the Orifice</i>. But first, the label has shot
    out this bile-soaked treasury of Arab on Radar's out-of-print odds-and-ends, a rusted-out Voltron they call
    <i>The Stolen Singles</i>.  The gritty, piercing noise-rock attack of the two-guitar/drum/vocal outfit that
    has warmed the hearts of lobotomy patients worldwide since '95 is well represented here.  Arab on Radar's
    seven-inches highlighted the soiled brevity of the band's albums; stitching them into their own release
    creates a year-by-year format of intermittent song spurts that makes for a logical collection.  Not at all
    throwaways, these tracks contain some of the band's strongest songwriting.  Be forewarned, though: what
    sounds ""strong"" to a decently sized fanbase is just as easily found discordant, jarring, and strident to
    others.</p><p>
    
    Getting a rare glimpse of the group's beginnings, early cassette track ""Inventor"" is the most accessible the
    band has ever been.  Seemingly a no-wave, android dance-party act, the tune features an addictive bassline
    the likes of which would never again be heard in their future efforts.  The Horshack-meets-Mork vocals of
    Eric ""Post-Traumatic Stress"" Paul turn him into ""the female defector,"" as he mindlessly chants about ""placentas""
    and ""ovulating.""  Think a sludgier, amelodic Devo, which works mainly on the power of sheer conviction.</p><p>
    
    The sound of this tune and the similar ""Aisle 5"" are short-lived, though, as Arab on Radar strangely seemed
    to de-evolve into aggressive, menacing noisemakers.  ""Pig Roast"", a 1996 seven-inch track, contains a guitar
    that sounds like it's amped through a Casio plugged into someone's butthole.  1998 B-side ""Samurai Fight
    Song"" is, curiously, a straight-up attempt at stoner rock.  More recent cut ""Running for Asthma"", from the
    Kid Commando split, sounds like dad's lawnmower trying to start after thirty years of abuse.  Oh yeah, and
    as the tracks progress, Mr. Stress' voice ever increasingly seems to be coming out of his nose-- more so
    with each passing year.  The man's lyrics, of course, are another story.  Potty humor?  Wit?  Whatever--
    titles like ""Swimming with a Hard-On"" and <i>Yahweh or the Highway</i> exude a certain charisma that I
    find a bit too rare these days.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the band's place on the bill of their final tour (referred to as Oops! The Tour) almost seems a
    better function of how they'll be remembered down the road.  Whether it be an overall tiring of The Locust,
    Lightning Bolt's equipment being in tatters, or late-comers missing out on Hella, Arab on Radar managed to
    slide into the middle commanding the most attention.  Hard to ignore, the group found themselves a notch in
    your eardrum between ""annoyance"" and ""tolerance.""  Existing fans of the band needing to play catch-up-- as
    well as aficionados for any group mentioned above-- are advised to pick up this sendoff, but consider it a
    recommendation made with caution.</p></div>"|267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/267-the-stolen-singles/|7.1|Matt Kallman

He showed up on
    the cover of last year's <em>Deadringer</em> with his skull busted open and bleeding all over his Sunday school
    clothes, and he's taking <em>The Horror</em> even more literally, with a photo of himself face-down in a pool
    of blood, next to somebody's stash of pop-top Schlitz cans.  I could throw out all kinds of scenarios that
    might lead to such an unfortunate demise, but it's probably best left for people to resolve with their own
    imaginations while I break down what's really important-- the music.</p><p>
    
    As has become Def Jux protocol, <em>The Horror</em> is a post-blockbuster collection of odds-and-ends designed
    to either shed new light on its predecessor or lure in suckas who slept on the original.  But where anyone
    else attempting such a dubious marketing scheme would be immediately called out for straight-up pirates, the
    Def Jukies have once again done an impressive job offering up baubles that satisfy both conditions.  Like
    <em>Deadringer</em>, <em>The Horror</em> begins with what's become Rj's signature cut, ""The Horror"", repeated
    verbatim with its punk-ass bassline and triumphant horn samples.  From there, the EP takes off on a compilation
    of B-sides and remixes that's dizzying enough to confuse the fuck out of anyone trying to play spot-the-differences,
    not to mention utterly betray the five kids who still collect Def Jux twelve-inches.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, there is one entirely new cut (""Sell the World""), but it's nowhere near revelatory.  Other than
    a Kurt Weill-ian bridge detour, the track isn't much more than standard downtempo-- pleasant enough, but far
    from on par with <i>Deadringer</i>'s best.  The previously unreleased remixes fare much better, especially
    the new take on ""Final Frontier"" that finds Vast Aire, Aesop Rock and Murs kickin' it along with Blueprint
    to the tune of a Def Jux posse cut that finally gets it right after a handful of misfires.  There's also an
    instrumental mix of ""Final Frontier"" that holds up well on its own thanks to that claustrophobic shuffle of
    a beat, and a superior version of ""F.H.H."" that breathes easier in the absence of Jakki Motormouth's
    run-of-the-mill mic check.</p><p>
    
    In regards to the B-side material, <em>The Horror</em> admirably corrals some fantastic cuts that have only
    been heard by the most obsessive of Def Jukies.  ""Bus Stop Bitties"" (originally found on the ""Let the Good
    Times Roll"" twelve-inch) captures Rj on some more of his ""thinking man's Moby"" shit, with its repeated sample
    of ""Cornbread/ And lima beans/ Candied yams/ Collard greens"" inciting equal amounts of ass-shaking and
    face-stuffing; one can only guess what might've happened had he run into those other bitties over at the BK
    lounge.  Similarly, the white-label-only ""part one"" of ""Good Times Roll"" grafts the same ""Mannish Boy"" verse
    over a significantly harder beat, even taking a Black Ark worthy dub detour in the middle.  I wish I could
    say the same for the ""June"" remix (from the twelve-inch for the original track) but, like the previously
    unreleased ""Ghostwriter"" mix, it's rather underwhelming, offering only shades of disparity from its original
    version.</p><p>
    
    Like El-P's <em>FanDam Plus</em> before it, Rj's EP comes with a second disc of multimedia material to presumably
    sweeten the deal.  Don't get me wrong, there are definitely a couple of redeeming factors-- like the surreal
    animation short for ""The Horror"" or the ""Making of 'The Horror' music video"" clip, shot on-location at the
    same abandoned mental hospital where <em>Jacob's Ladder</em> was filmed-- that make disc two more than
    collector-bait.  But beyond the few people who've always wanted to know that he's stolen beats from Kentucky
    Fried Chicken commercials (""as long as it's hott"" indeed!) or never seen Rj and El-P do their Doug E. Fresh
    and Slick Rick routine at the end of ""Squeegee Man Shooting"" on tour, it's a mere novelty and not much more.</p><p>
    
    Since I'm positive that no one over at Def Jux central is losing sleep over these questionable-at-best
    marketing tactics, I'll let them off the hook once again-- because <em>The Horror</em> is still a solid
    reiteration of Rj's remarkable talent.  And if he wants to keep using the bleeding head wound fixation to
    disguise his music from the uplifting force it truly is, I won't begrudge him that one simple pleasure--
    even if his records betray him every cut of the way.</p></div>"|6796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6796-the-horror-ep/|7.3|Scott Hreha

    replied in kind, ""So what you're saying is that you are a magic, talking bull, and you have the secret to my
    success?""</p><p>
    
    ""That is correct,"" the bull calmly replied.</p><p>
    
    Streng was nervous, as this was the first time he'd met a talking bull during any of the many roadside
    bathroom-stops his band makes during their busy tour schedule.  ""Well... what is it?""</p><p>
    
    ""The reason your band hasn't hit it big yet is because you don't yet have the strength to break-on-through.
    What you need to do to in order to gain strength,"" the bull cleared its throat, ""is eat one of the paddies
    of excrement I've produced in the field.  It's rich in nutrients that will make you and your band the Next
    Big Thing.""</p><p>
    
    ""Gee... I don't know about that...""</p><p>
    
    ""Lou Reed did it.""</p><p>
    
    This was undoubtedly assuring to Streng as he went face-first into the dung, and began his dietary regiment.
    It certainly seemed to help him accomplish his goal, as The Stratford 4 began to climb the ranks of
    indie-rock stardom, first with their EP <i>This Could Be Heaven</i>, then with their full-length debut
    <i>The Revolt Against Tired Noises</i>, culminating in anticipation for their latest release on Jetset
    Records, <i>Love and Distortion</i>.  Early on, top names such as <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>The Chicago
    Sun-Times</i> lauded the album as a true union between seemingly disparate influences as My Bloody Valentine,
    Yo La Tengo, and The Velvet Underground.</p><p>
    
    With the help of producer Chris Walla, Streng had finally given
    the world his full artistic vision, and it appeared at least initially that the world was accepting it in
    the same manner that Streng himself had originally accepted the defecation of that magical bovine, with an
    open mouth and a blind eye.  Unfortunately for Streng-- and the rest of the band-- the moral of the story
    was soon to hit them square in the Rickenbacker 12-string: you can learn to fly high by feeding off bullshit,
    but sooner or later you are going down for the count.</p><p>
    
    Though one would be hard-pressed to accuse the band of false advertising-- as there is both love and
    distortion present on the album-- the word ""fake"" comes to mind.  From the faux-British accent (""She Married
    the Birds"") to the teenage content of such imaginatively titled tracks as ""Tonight Would Be Alright"" and
    ""The Simple Things Take Over"" (sample lyric: ""I don't want to be your friend/ And I don't want this to end""),
    the band sounds more a product of pop culture than the cultivated indie-aesthete conveyed in the album's
    liner notes and content.</p><p>
    
    Lest you doubt their credentials, the track ""Telephone"" literally and figuratively runs the gamut of the
    artistic influences upon which The Stratford 4 base themselves for better or worse.  Amidst a fictional
    call to his mother, Streng relates how his world is falling apart while simultaneously asking for advice on
    what to do about it.  His mother-- a thin veil for this cross-generational metaphor-- replies that it all
    depends on ""what you're listening to.""  Of course, hipster that he is, Streng has his CD wallet unzipped,
    ready to list off such band names as ""Spacemen 3, Primal Scream, and T. Rex/ Belle and Sebastian and The
    Bunnymen"" before giving in to the suggestion of his mother not to ""forget Bob Dylan, and don't forget the
    Stones.""  While great in their own respect, one would expect that, given this large group of influential
    artists, the band could have produced a track (or album, for that matter) that showed a bit more variety
    and variability beyond the scope of sopping introspective lyrics and dulled hooks.</p><p>
    
    It's telling that the band's moment of shining promise comes at the end of the track that damns them the
    most, when Streng finally takes a break from being the constraining superego with the line ""there's more to
    this life than The Stratford 4.""  Like a weight lifted off their shoulders, the rest of the band is afforded
    the opportunity to explore the limited sonic region they've decided to call their own, and to good effect,
    as the final half of the song comes closest to the origin of their purported sound.  Even more promise is
    shown with the harder and decidedly catchier ""The Story Is Over"", with its meaty guitar riff and thankfully
    muted vocals.</p><p>
    
    ""Kleptophilia"" and ""Tiger Girl"" display a much stronger songwriting style, allowing the fuzzed-out guitars
    and tinny percussion to lead the way through relatively strong bridges and brief choruses.  Unfortunately,
    the tracks grow increasingly difficult to hear as the album concludes, not because of any abstract artistic
    statement on the band's behalf-- mercifully-- but due to the deafening roar of used bin CDs clapping against
    one another as consumers rifle through the vast abundance of The Stratford 4's <i>Love and Distortion</i>,
    all sold in a fit of rage that can only follow failed expectations after being force-fed overpraise, which
    is more often than not a load of shit.</p></div>"|7528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7528-love-and-distortion/|4.5|Andrew Bryant

    audience up on stage and asks them to feel for his heart rate.  It starts out steady, but as the person
    holds both wrists, it slows, and Graves begins to diverge his bloodstream on either side of his body,
    finally achieving an internal polyrhythmic pulse between the two points.  Then he jumps behind his kit
    and clatters away in ecstasy.</p><p>
    
    Four Tet's lone member, Kieran Hebden, is fascinated with the impossible rhythms that the free-form jazz
    greats could bang out as they pleased.  Whether or not he's taking a page out of Milford Graves' book is
    debatable, but he opens ""Hands"" with a cardiac sample fibrillating into a multi-limbed percussive rattle
    of densely edited and seemingly random drum hit samples that just starts to stroke Barry Altschul's beard
    before locking down into a hip-hop groove. He fades the cymbals' sizzles into the pseudo-Clyde Stubblefield
    sticks of ""She Moves She"", a cycling song evenly spaced with wheeling rimshots, scattered gongs, and funky
    string plucks that veer around the car horns that bleat past.</p><p>
    
    ""My Angel Rocks Back and Forth"" gently blows iron-lung sighs through ride cymbals and dirty, run-out
    grooves while an austere piano twinkles, hinting at the sort of gentle sounds Hebden will soon weave
    around English folk legend Vashti Bunyan.  Verging on the lugubrious is the nine-minute ""Unspoken"" (whose
    piano riff is lifted from, of all sources, Tori Amos' ""Winter""), but Hebden's touch keeps it from morass.
    Here, he controls his ingredients-- fictitious soundbytes of early Gato Barbieri sax, a plaintive finger
    or two from McCoy Tyner, broken chimes, backwards feedback, and a DJ Shadow kickdrum-- keeping them at a
    contemplative simmer, rather than allowing them to come to a full boil.</p><p>
    
    ""Chia"" is a tabla-bubbling conduit to the mod bass and shimmying sitar of ""As Serious as Your Life"",
    namechecking the crucial free-jazz text by Val Wilmer, yet standing much closer to Miles Davis' <i>On the
    Corner</i>, with those odd-metered handclaps and that stuttering punch of a Jack DeJohnette hi-hat. With
    metallophone ripples at a wake, ""And They All Look Broken Hearted"" is an abstract and solemn affair,
    recalling the oddly melodic cadence of a player like Bobby Hutcherson, and with spliced drum solos
    swirling around some affected harpsichord and vibraphones like club smoke, Hebden captures the cool
    sadness of old Blue Note posters.  It sounds like a shoo-in for the album's closing track, but it instead
    leads up to ""Slow Jam"", which has that long goodbye of the best melancholy closers, a circle game of
    echoing footsteps, fitful static, gleeful kazoos, lulling guitar repetitions, and shadows surely sinking
    in, revolving all disparate sounds to resolution.</p><p>
    
    Freely moving in and out of cycles, able to coalesce or evanesce in a heartbeat, straight up and down, or
    else banging about like a toddler on the pot shelf, <i>Rounds</i> funnels every element through the drum,
    which always remains at the forefront of the mix.  But what gives this record its internal order, and
    allows it to stand out against previous laptop explorations of immense record collections, is the other
    genres Hebden dabbles in and draws upon to flesh out the beat.  Though hardly obvious the first time
    through, there's the supple, propulsive fun of funk, as well as the pastoral placidity of folk, both
    moving over the cut-up rhythms like cumulous clouds, allowing hot light through at some junctures, but

My adolescent heroes are a vanishing
    breed, it seems, yet Pat Boone might as well be immortal-- where's the justice?  It's a bum deal, really:
    you care enough about an artist's music, and somewhere down the line you end up caring about the person
    behind it, too.  Artists give themselves up in their work, and we connect with that small part of them,
    though they're probably folks most of us have never even seen or known.  But confronting the knowledge that
    suddenly there's no one on the receiving end of your myriad, tiny bonds leaves an emptiness.  It's minor,
    sure, but to me at least, it's undeniable, and writing about it is even worse.  There's little room in
    criticism for eulogy (and vice versa), leaving the underlying sentiment merely to seep in through the cracks.
    Still, the vague knowledge of loss remains.</p><p>
    John Fahey died following a sextuple bypass on February 22nd, 2001, six days before he would turn sixty-one,
    after co-authoring the emancipation of acoustic guitars everywhere, freeing them from the shackles of their
    American roots masters.  With barely more than spare, deliberately picked acoustic finger patterns and the
    often eerie hollowness in between, ""he was the first to demonstrate that the finger-picking techniques of
    traditional country and blues steel-string guitar could be used to express a world of non-traditional musical
    ideas-- harmonies and melodies you'd associate with Bartók, Charles Ives, or maybe the music of India,"" in
    the words of (of all people) his close friend and colleague, Dr. Demento.  This omnipresent restlessness
    with his chosen medium even led him to disown much of his early work in favor of experimental drones and
    extended forays into free-form musique concrete.  His output is vast, and owing to the constant flux of
    trends it contains, quite humbling.</p><p>
    Listening to the echoing ghosts of ""Remember"", Fahey's morose take on the Irving Berlin standard that opens
    <i>Red Cross</i>, it's hard not to absent-mindedly begin searching its haunting stillnesses and recesses for
    hidden goodbyes, or some tell-tale resolution.  It casts the rest of the album in such heartbreaking shades
    that the need for closure (of a sort) is almost palpable.  Through retrospective artifice, though, it's all
    too easy to see so much in little more than a title, and in the end this opening piece is more of an open
    question.</p><p>
    Much of the album nods to moments throughout Fahey's career, perhaps accidentally, but nonetheless
    offering thin glimpses of his stylistic diversity, with ""Remember"" poised to prepare the listener.  Although
    the delicate acoustic works of <i>Red Cross</i> are powerful, they only mimic things Fahey has accomplished
    a dozen times before, and better.  He's been rightly accused of a lingering redundancy in his recent work,
    but this album seems more readily taken as a conscious overview.  The memories stirred up by these compositions
    are very purposeful, if only half-formed.</p><p>
    The unsettling but still beautiful hollows can't help but invite nostalgia.  Fahey began to accept his more
    traditional material late in life, reassessing the worth of the blues and standards he had once disavowed,
    and <i>Red Cross</i> certainly shows hints of his own coming to terms.  Allusions to the amorphous compositions
    of his later years are kept side-by-side with a minor helping of refreshingly straightforward arrangements.
    He approaches the classic George Gershwin tune ""Summertime"" in his typically painstaking fashion, realizing
    it as less of a warm weather romp than a ballad of bittersweet solitude.  Where there was once ye olde
    swimmin' hole and children playing stickball in the street, the kids aren't allowed to go to the lake since
    some hapless child drowned last summer, and the streets and playgrounds are all disquietingly barren.  Only
    the vague peace that comes from memories of simpler times remains.</p><p>
    Similarly, the original composition ""Charlie Bradley's Ten-Sixty-Six Blues"", is also reminiscent of vintage
    material, not as impressive as his most concerted efforts toward country-blues form, but still breathtaking
    in its remarkable quietism.  And it fares better than the dry, Arabian ""Ananaias"" or ""Red Cross, Disciple of
    Christ Today"" with its uncomfortably spare string-bending; respectively, they evoke the exotic promise of
    Fahey's seminal acoustic ragas and his bold forays into noise, but ultimately fail to develop fully.  In a
    way, these meandering explorations are a hallmark of his own, and (particularly in the seven-minute expanse
    of ""Ananaias"") contain more than a few enlightening passages without necessarily forming a cohesive whole.</p><p>
    The only real misstep is ""Untitled with Rain"".  For six minutes, the song flows leisurely across faintly
    ringing organ tones and chimes, with just a few scattered notes recalling some of Fahey's concrete leanings.
    At that moment, the music dissipates into eighteen minutes of thoroughly impenetrable silence while the
    ambient noise of a deserted studio is mic'd up for, presumably, listening pleasure.  Sadly, his generally
    keen abstract edge is at its dullest-- any similar track from <i>City of Refuge</i> makes this seem like a
    cheap gimmick.  And worse, if it weren't for the (almost fittingly) unnamed tonal reverb of the track's
    final two minutes, the closing seconds of his final album would conclude in a vacuum.  Even if <i>Red
    Cross</i> is less of a striking conclusion than a broad summation, it's a tragedy to allow the vague
    recognitions elicited here to evaporate into nothing.  It's silence in remembrance of a talented, haunted
    man, but he deserves a eulogy, and his guitar speaks better than anyone ever could.</p></div>"|2945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2945-red-cross/|7.3|Eric Carr

They've developed a label identity that
    encompasses the ghosts of trip-hop and acid jazz, the freshness of engaging laptop hip-hop, and a cantankerous
    enjoyment of taking the piss out of all three. As a result, they're responsible for some of the most enjoyable
    and versatile electronic albums available, bridging genre gaps at every turn like they were cracks in the
    sidewalk. But when you're dishing out a product that the kiddies are digging, it becomes risky to switch
    things up. Crystal Pepsi, New Coke: you fuck with the formula slightly, and the consumer switches to some
    other brand till you bring back the classic stuff. Better to go the Pop-Tarts route-- give 'em 20 different
    flavors of the same pastry goodness-- and watch the units shift.</p><p>
    
    In that sense, Pest's energetic, balls-out <i>Necessary Measures</i> is a success. It manages to taste like
    something (sort of) new using ingredients that can be found on any other disc in the Ninja Tune cupboard.
    Coming on like a more street-savvy hooligan incarnation of here-today-gone-today sensations The Avalanches,
    Pest spice up turntablism and jazzy breaks with a dash of party funk and sampledelia, aiming for a Solid
    Steel milestone. What they give us isn't quite so revelatory, but the pure manic energy the group exhibits
    keeps their debut album from getting completely lost in the newest wave of Ninja Tune products, which
    includes Super Numeri, Hint, Fog, and Jaga Jazzist.</p><p>
    
    In execution, Pest couldn't do the Ninja Tune sound more justice. From the get-go they're lanky and rubbery,
    laying down fuzzy bass carpets, and slotting in horn and piano samples like they just hit the crate diggers'
    jackpot. The swingin' ""Duke Kerb Crawler"" keeps the big band bluster in check with a lazy beat, punctuated
    by stabs of brass, and Pest follow it up with the string-heavy ""Jefferson Shuffle"", a mash-up of symphonic
    soap opera theme music, snappy percussion, and a hilarious vocal bridge that devolves into a serious hip-hop
    break that occupies space somewhere between Ultramagnetic MCs and a wild bar mitzvah. ""Dr. Umz"", which begins
    as a fairly annoying loop only Mr. Magoo could love, explodes once Blackalicious' Gift of Gab starts rockin'
    the mic with his usual breathless cadence, turning what began as a lackluster four minutes into a definite
    keeper.</p><p>
    
    When Pest play their cards right, they come across like Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood or Bullfrog, packing a healthy
    underground swagger that permeates whatever genre they throw into the pot.  But even when they're doing things
    right, their success is dictated by the prevailing laws of Ninja Tune. They fit the label's profile to a T,
    and so anything they do right on <i>Necessary Measures</i> is stuff you've heard done right before. With the
    exception of the closer (track five on the vinyl version), ""Relief"", with its jangling, Paul Simon-circa-<i>Graceland</i>
    guitar and inventive, lo-fi beat, everything here is disposable-- even the good stuff. Pest don't need any
    help sounding indistinguishable, but at least half of the ten tracks here seem ready and willing to lend a
    hand in the effort. The thick ""Heard Your Bird Moved In"" could easily be a Mr. Scruff outtake, and Gift of
    Gab was already put to much better use by DJ Vadim.  And for all of its lovely moments, ""St. Pest"" is guilty
    of robbing Animals on Wheels' piano closet blind.</p><p>
    
    Removed from the context of the Ninja Tune multiverse, perhaps Pest would fair better. But my instincts tell
    me that <i>Necessary Measures</i> would remain indistinct no matter what label was putting it out. To put it
    another way, the album tastes pretty good, but I've been drinking this down since '96. Instead of producing
    a sound that comfortably approximates what's come before, Pest should be working on their strengths and
    fine-tuning their approach, finding their own identity. So what if it ends up tasting like Coke II? There
    must have been someone out there that just couldn't get enough of that shit.</p></div>"|6246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6246-necessary-measures/|6.1|Mark Martelli

    silent partner Bret Lunsford; Microphones nature boy Phil Elvrum; and my favorite ex-oyster shucker, Karl
    Blau.  Promising!  Although last year's <i>Mistake</i> was somewhat slight and uninspired (sometimes
    reminiscent of the tossed-off air of Beat Happening's self-titled yellow album), I had hope for <i>Deception
    Pass</i>: Elvrum seems to grow more ambitious daily, Beat Happening were often able to squeeze hooks from stones,
    and Blau's <i>Clothes Your I's</i> surprised the socks off me just a month ago.  Instead, <i>Deception
    Pass</i>-- named for a narrow band of water separating Washington's Whidbey Island from the mainland-- is
    a skeletal, less rocking, and more Lunsford-centric <i>Mistake</i> (in a couple senses).</p><p>
    
    The first track, ""Skin Me"", is paint-by-numbers love-rock reminiscent of a few too many seven-inches purchased
    solely because they came out on a label I trusted: listen twice, file with the rest of that forgettable
    international pop overflow. More painfully, on the eponymous ""Deception Pass"", Lunsford's a dead ringer
    for Kermit the Frog. I dare you to block out the saccharine harmony of ""Rainbow Connection"" as he warbles,
    ""The water's too cold, I know where you've been, the water's too cold, I know.""</p><p>
    
    When D+ are less Kermit/more Silver Jews, the seas get friendlier. ""Blind Spot"" is a catchy pine-needle pop
    song with a good politico-fairy tale lyrical turn: ""I voted for the wrong whore/ I'm paying for the wrong
    war/ Mirror says we're fairest of all..."" On ""Kill the Messenger"", Elvrum's drums made me dote on ""Bad Seeds""
    or a primitive Velvet Underground jam-- and everyone harmonizes over the chorus into a final minute of
    la-la-la's, rat-a-tat drums, and Blau's swooping, airy backup.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the less compelling 50-second ""I Don't Owe You Anything"" is awkwardly embarrassing poetry:
    ""Song is like a medicine... meta sin... meta sun/ Fill the groove of Edison... let us in... let us sin.""
    ""Sound"" offers interesting instrumentation redolent of Peter Jefferies' everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink
    approach: tapping, something like sandpaper, and the repeated line, ""I want to plant a sound."" Nice. ""No
    Charge"" is basically ""Advice to the Graduate"" for the seafaring. (Whoever thought David Berman made such
    a lasting impression?)</p><p>
    
    So, <i>Deception Pass</i> does have its decent moments.  But things go incredibly wrong when ""Camptown""
    rolls around.  Here, Brett and a piano remind us of that bourgeois mustached Snowman from the Rudolph
    Christmas special.  It's of the <i>Ernest Goes to Camp</i> school of poetics. The mega-chirpy ""Blame-a-Holic""
    could make even a stoic cringe: ""It's not me me me me me/ It's all you you you you you...""  And on the final
    track, ""We Could Do Anything"", things disintegrate into Queen-as-interpreted-by-early-pork-roll-egg-and-cheese
    Ween. Oh me oh my! If I could do a play-by-play of ""We Could Do Anything"", you still wouldn't understand the
    unbearable badness of its 25 minutes.  In the spirit of completion, here's a bit:</p><p>
    
    There's rain, rustling paper, maybe a water stick.  Then we get a hand-clapping Blind Boys of Alabama
    campfire round: ""You got the upper hand when you up and died on me."" The rain thing reemerges. Pause.
    Silver Jews. Rain stops. Rain starts. It's fucking water torture! A guitar. Creaky gate. More rain?
    Radio hiss! Dials! People going between channels! Then there's a distorted voice singing about hell
    and pain. Computer voices bleeping about a hell mouth and somebody saying, ""Don't fuck with the dead.""
    The opus ends with Casio drums and a chilled-out breeze: Martin Denny after a KMFDM monsoon.</p><p>
    
    Maybe D+ had extra studio time or decided to make a statement transcending the rest of their oeuvre?  Hell,
    that's what Eddie does with Rimbaud in <i>Eddie and the Cruisers</i>, right? But it drove him crazy. Maybe
    this baroque ending is the deception of the title! You've made it from one end of the gorge to the other
    when all of a sudden, in comes the deus ex machina of Greek tragedy: Trent Reznor on a swinging cable starts
    a pallid avalanche and sinks your battleship. Everybody hurts!</p></div>"|2122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2122-deception-pass/|4.8|Brandon Stosuy

In the early 90s, when ""post-rock"" meant English people moving past
    shoegazing into ambient and dub, they caromed into view on a buzzy organ-and-guitar rush, droning joyously
    into a frenzy as poppy as it was driving.  By the <i>late</i> 90s, when ""post-rock"" meant Chicagoans with
    jazz ambitions going nuts with the vibraphones, their tight drones had opened up into a fascinating grab-bag
    of swingy lounge and spacy pop, much of which was as terrifically conceived as anything else that decade.
    Some naysayers like to point out that they sounded like the metronomic grooves of Neu!, but they just as
    often sounded like Faust, the hyper Parisian pop of France Gall, the loungy exotica of Martin Denny, the
    bloopy Moog-music of Jean-Jacques Perry, or any of the dozen other acts whose reissues they laid some
    groundwork for.  And if the reams of fresh ideas on Stereolab's best albums weren't proof enough to
    convince detractors that the band's songs possessed as much depth as their record collections, <i>ABC
    Music</i> stands to close the issue.</p><p>
    
    The run of sessions presented on this two-disc collection is broad, stretching from 1991 to 2001 and
    covering every major phase of the band's progression over its 32 tracks.  As such, it's hard not to get
    a little nostalgic, to start mentally mapping the Complete History of Stereolab for old hands and
    newcomers alike:</p><p>
<b>The Earliest Days.</b>  Represented here by two Peel Sessions from 1991 and 1992.  Stereolab's appearance
    was a revelation, and that's just how this compilation kicks off: with a quick, blurry run through the
    anthemic bounce of ""Super Electric"", which starts off droning and doesn't stop until you've had enough.
    Maybe it was the purposeful hum of Tim Gane's guitar or Laetitia Sadier's matter-of-fact melodies, but
    Stereolab always came out sounding like they were leading some sort of stirring revolutionary march through
    your headspace, Sadier playing Eponine in a future moon-version of <i>Les Miserables</i>. There's the
    contemplative jangle of ""Changer"" as well as the slow harmonic shifts of ""Doubt"" (another hymn), but my
    personal favorites from this batch come with the wrecking pulse of ""John Cage Bubblegum""-- a shifting
    collage of melodic mantras over an unstoppable charge-- and the wistful abandon of ""Peng 33"" where Sadier
    enthuses about the world's possibilities over a weirdly heartbreaking chord pattern; the fact that her
    lyrics are mostly paraphrasing from the opening of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> actually makes
    it better.</p><p>
<b>The Early Middle Period.</b>  These heavily represented days saw the Lab's drones go from a lo-fi rush
    to more varied and concrete forms-- the first high-water mark of the Stereolab Can Do No Wrong era-- and
    appropriately, the set leads with ""Wow and Flutter"" from their longest, sleepiest, outer-spaciest record,
    <i>Mars Audiac Quintet</i>.  Soon after, we come to the single ""French Disko"", which had the band summarizing
    its entire early charge into one pitch-perfect pop moment; ""La Resistance!"" they cheer, confirming that
    revolutionary-anthem impression.  ""Lo Boob Oscillator"", one of their earliest pretty-swing excursions,
    has Mary Hansen and future Snowpony frontwoman Katharine Gifford doing 50s harmonies while Sadier paints
    pictures of the moon drifting freely here and there; ""Golden Ball"", unfortunately, stands as the only
    representative of <i>Transient Random Noise-Bursts with Announcements</i>, the Lab's darkest and most
    disorienting record.  I wish they'd done ""Crest"", but I also wish Sadier had a stronger voice, as she
    struggles to be heard all through these sessions.  Still, this is the Stereolab that switched people on,
    and it's on lovely display here.</p><p>
<b>The Late Middle Period.</b>  This is where the beauty of <i>ABC Music</i> is unveiled.  Stereolab's
    records completed a long-term turn they'd been taking since the mid-90s, from a straight-up band-in-a-room
    feel to a focus on studio-assisted pop experiments.  The beauty of seeing Stereolab live, however, was
    discovering how much of their signature sound was really just down to them: from beginning to end, and
    through a cavalcade of new rhythm sections and sidemen, they were always at heart a tight little pop combo,
    and one that could swing and groove as easily as it could rev up the organ buzz.  The sessions from this
    period start off with the track that just might be the high point of their recording history: a slow-mounting
    groove called ""Metronomic Underground"", from <i>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</i>, which reveals itself as every
    bit as band-in-a-room as their first singles-- the trick, for anyone who hasn't noticed, wasn't that
    Stereolab had some insane recording budget, but that they actually constructed songs that sounded massively
    interesting.  This impression is only reinforced by the other tracks from <i>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</i>,
    without doubt the pinnacle of Stereolab as the architects of fascinating song-machines: the odd
    back-and-forth off-rhythm of ""Tomorrow Is Already Here"" and the peppy bubbling of ""Les Yper-Sound"" become
    clearer revelations the more you can hear the band actually playing them, and the gorgeous swooning of
    personal-favorite ""Slow Fast Hazel"", with its gently revolving bass and watery guitar breaks, is one of
    the finest things here.</p><p>
<b>The Late Period.</b>  One popular music-geek game is the one that goes When Did This Band Stop Being Good,
    a mental diversion on which pretty much everyone with any interest in R.E.M. has spent some time.  This game
    gets played a lot with Stereolab, with the biggest point of contention among moderates being whether <i>Dots
    and Loops</i>-- the most plainly and deliberately ""post-rock"" of Stereolab's albums-- was a well-formed
    flagship of the era or the point where Stereolab gave up.  <i>Dots and Loops</i> is not represented at all
    on this collection; neither is <i>Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night</i>, which most
    everyone agrees was the Lab's first truly bad record, by-numbers to the point of self-parody.  The band
    were mostly just unlucky: They released their first flop right at the moment when listeners were starting
    to move on anyway, and their passable return-to-form, <i>Sound-Dust</i>, was followed by the hugely tragic
    death of key member Mary Hansen.  <i>Sound-Dust</i> is represented here by four tracks from a 2001 session,
    all of which-- surprisingly for those like me, who'd started shaking their heads around <i>Cobra</i>--
    sound great, if sometimes a bit too ""easy.""</p><p>
    
    As a Smiths-obsessed teenager, I played that band's albums to death, meaning my later Smiths listening always
    revolved around the less mediated perspectives of radio sessions and live recordings.  The Stereolab-in-a-box
    on offer here has the potential to turn into the same for me: they play plenty of non-album songs throughout,
    the most fascinating being the EP track ""Pinball"", originally titled ""Heavenly Van Halen"" most likely because
    it sounds sort of like Heavenly, and sort of like Van Halen.  The groop sounds great and tight and, well,
    the slightest bit different here, exposing how they functioned when scaled down to just instruments in a
    room.  It's a rich and pretty glorious history.  Far be it from me to go writing epitaphs for Stereolab
    already, but: it's been wonderful.</p></div>"|7500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7500-abc-music-the-radio-1-sessions/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

A rather playful series of references to the Velvet Underground, it puts the reverence for rock and roll's past that Velvet 
    Crush mainmen Ric Menck and Paul Chastain on full display, but it turns out they chose the wrong band to pay homage to.  The Velvet Underground were all fiery confrontation, restless 
    exploration and urban decay, and the Velvet Crush are really none of that; if anything, they're revivalist, pious, and utterly suburban.  But they did get one thing right on the cover of their latest 
    album, and that's the title.</p><p>
<i>Soft Sounds</i> abound on this, their fifth proper full-length, and first since 1999.  Long gone is the hyperactive jangle and thick guitar sound that propelled 1994's <i>Teenage Symphonies to God</i> and 
    their other early records, replaced instead with a piano-dominated sound that perhaps reflects older age and deeper thought, but doesn't excite quite as much.  It's not nearly as extreme as, 
    say, Eric Carmen leaving the Raspberries and recording \x93All By Myself\x94, but it's sort of the same idea.</p><p>
    Even with the change in sound, the Crush keep it in the Me decade, as evidenced by the Badfinger/America/Big Star harmonies and Leslied guitar that pop up on the slow-gaited opener 
    \x93Staying Found\x94.  \x93Don't Take Me Dowx94 is the sole look back at the band's early nineties basement days, Paul Chastaix92s gentle tenor sounding just as good today as it did when he relocated 
    from Champaign-Urbana to Rhode Island over a decade ago.  Menck grabs the mic for a heavily countrified take on the Boxtops' \x93Rollix92 in My Sleep\x94 that lays yet another wreath at the Shrine of 
    Chilton, but never approaches his ragged delivery. </p><p>
    A pair of additional covers reveal where the boys' musical heads have been lately, though they bring everything they touch right back to their own middle ground.  Their take on Fleetwood Mac's 
    \x93Save Me a Place\x94-- originally on that band's wild <i>Tusk</i>-- could almost be counted radical for the way it reins the song in and makes it sound conventional (for a recent version closer in 
    spirit, if not sound, to the original, check out Camper Van Beethovex92s version on their full-length cover of the entire <i>Tusk</i> album).  Stranger is their version of Scott Walker's \x93Duchess\x94, 
    which oddly sounds almost exactly like \x93Knockix92 on Heavex92s Door\x94.  Chastain does his best, but only a few vocalists can handle Scott Walker truly well, and he really isn't one of them.</p><p>
    Looming huge in the background throughout the album is Matthew Sweet, who recorded <i>Soft Sounds</i> over the course of a couple years and plays a host of instruments.  Though he 
    leaves the spotlight to the band (as any producer should), and his voice blends seamlessly into most of the harmonies, there are times when you can definitely pick out his guitar.  With

    sure as hell wouldn't want to live there.  A world where maniacal hitchhikers wait for unsuspecting
    Samaritans at the edge of town and midgets and harelips cavort in saturnalian bliss on empty carnival
    grounds might offer a fair amount of solace to extreme cases of psychological disability, but for a normal
    guy like me it's a tourist destination and nothing more.</p><p>
    Patton, on the other hand, seems perfectly at ease with his permanent residency in the macabre corners of
    the psyche.  After almost single-handedly inventing rap-metal (or at least stealing the patent from Chuck
    Mosely) with Faith No More, he spent most of the next decade-plus growling, shrieking and spitting his way
    from a blip on the pop culture radar screen to certifiable obscurity, thanks to his work with Fantômas and
    a pair of solo records on fellow nutjob John Zorn's Tzadik imprint.  But somewhere between starting his own
    record label to prove that there are other weirdos out there making music as thoroughly twisted as his, and
    crooning his way to soft-porn nirvana with Dan the Automator on <i>Lovage</i>, Patton answered a call from
    ex-Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison-- turns out Denison has an unquenchable fetish for writing music for
    oddball singers, and Patton was just the scratch to relieve his itch.</p><p>
    With fellow musclemen John Stanier (late of Helmet) and Kevin Rutmanis (ex-Cows, The Melvins) fleshing out
    the DNA strain for this new monster, they christened it Tomahawk and started scalping motherfuckers from the
    get-go.  Not only was their 2001 self-titled debut easily Patton's best work since his Faith No More/Mr.
    Bungle heyday, but the band also managed to land an opening slot with wannabe-freaks Tool (presumably to
    lend the headliners some cred on the mentally impaired circuit)-- giving weight to the long-debated theory
    that routinely being booed off the stage by 15,000 black-clad teenagers only solidifies your resolve as a
    working musical unit.</p><p>
    Although I'm not usually susceptible to press release anti-hyperbole like ""<em>Mit Gas</em> finds Tomahawk more
    comfortable working together as a proper group,"" I'll be damned if there isn't something to that little bit
    of PR wisdom that accompanies Tomahawk's second full-length.  For one, Patton's keyboards play an inextricable
    role within the band this time out, allowing the group to straddle the distance between ambience and onslaught
    even more remarkably than on its first record.  This is especially evident on instrumental segues like the
    untitled section between ""You Can't Win"" and ""Mayday"" and the self-contained ""Harlem Clowns"", both of which
    suggest that the band could improvise an entire set off of something similar and it would be virtually
    mindblowing.  Adding to Tomahawk's musical evolution is the fact that Denison's guitar lines are significantly
    less riff-oriented than before; sure, he's still just as likely to throw down some Zeppelin-worthy flatted-fifth
    power chords, but he spends more of his time clearing the room for Patton to throw his voice around like an
    abusive stepfather.</p><p>
    Song-wise, there are some real killers on <em>Mit Gas</em>-- cuts that reference the intensity of the
    self-titled record but still manage to take it to a higher level.  ""Rape This Day"" and ""Mayday"" both have
    Herculean punk-rock choruses that pimp-slap any and all competition into a fetal position, while ""You Can't
    Win"" uses a cheap drum machine to approximate the sound of horseflies buzzing around a rotting foxtrot
    corpse.  ""Capt. Midnight"" is equally abrasive-yet-melodic, as it builds the band's newfound mastery of
    dynamic tension into an epic meditation on something to do with ""don't be afraid"" and ""stinking lies.""
    In fact, the only track that's downright displaced is the Spanish-language ""love song"" ""Desastre Natural""--
    while the realization that Patton can now inflict his disturbed will upon millions more in foreign lands
    is frightening, the song as a whole is about as entertaining as Enrique Iglesias on crystal meth.</p><p>
    Now, I could try to pass off my own PR jive like ""<em>Mit Gas</em> isn't for the faint of heart"" or some other
    bullshit cliché like that, but I'd just be rehashing what was already obvious as soon as I mentioned Patton's
    name in the first sentence (not to mention that I'd also be writing like a goddamn chump).  But anyone who
    gets off on a good old-fashioned visit to the dark side like I do (to reiterate, keyword = ""visit"") should
    turn the volume up, sit back, and picture Patton growing fins and a Hitler mustache while taking this
    Teutonic geek show on the road.</p></div>"|8099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8099-mit-gas/|8.4|Scott Hreha

    Fat and saturated fat contents are laid out in familiar gram quantities and percentages, anything that's
    come within thirty miles of a peanut is generally labeled as such, and potentially misleading words like
    ""healthy"" have been yanked from packages of those sneaky little gummy bears.</p><p>
    
    Most people who aren't named Tipper Gore seem to be pretty firmly against placing warning labels on CDs.
    And considering the fact that the current labeling system consists only of a single sticker, who can blame
    them?  I think a more detailed, descriptive music labeling system is in order.  You know, like listing the
    ingredients: ""guitar noodling, harmonica solos, histrionic vocals, overproduction,"" that sort of thing.
    Or maybe more useful labels like, ""contains 115% RDA of vocoders,"" ""not a significant source of songwriting
    prowess,"" or even ""please recycle.""</p><p>
    
    Were such a system to be implemented, <i>If He Is Protecting Our Nation, Then Who Will Protect Big Oil, Our
    Children?</i> would most likely bear the following, much-needed sticker:</p><p>
<b>WARNING: Tour-only odds-and-ends release, contains minimal nutritional value.</b></p><p>
    
    Truth be told, I had no idea what to make of this disc when I first saw it in stores.  Its title and cover
    art, in which George W. Bush ejaculates oil onto a young boy's head, led me to believe it might be a
    political-type record.  And that seemed like a pretty intriguing concept to me-- to filter the sometimes
    incredibly surreal state of world affairs through Of Montreal's fantastical, often child-like music could
    certainly yield some interesting results.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, as the aforementioned labeling system is not yet in place, it wasn't until I opened up the album that
    I realized this was not the case.  Instead, <i>If He Is Protecting Our Nation</i> offers a disjointed
    collection of unreleased songs and alternate versions of album material.  It would be tempting to say that
    this album suffers from a simple lack of unity, but their previous singles compilation, <i>Horse &amp; Elephant
    Eatery</i>, showed the band more than capable of stringing together a great record from disparate sources.
    The problem is that, quite simply, the material on <i>If He Is Protecting Our Nation</i> just isn't that
    good.</p><p>
    
    Case in point: ""There Is Nothing Wrong with Hating Rock Critics"", in which Kevin Barnes reads off a list of
    the usual complaints musicians hurl at critics: ""What makes you think that you're better than anyone?/ You
    don't even create, you just critique,"" then, ""There's something wrong with you/ There's nothing wrong with
    me!""  Ouch!  Sorry, Kevin, but a lot of us critics, with our ""corrupt"" hearts, actually really like a lot of
    your music!  I'm not even really that opposed to anti-rock-critic anthems-- The Bevis Frond's ""There's Always
    One"", aside from being a great song, actually contains some insightful and well-founded complaints, my
    favorite being, ""Is it cool to be The Velvets/ But pathetic to be Cream?""  Unfortunately, ""There Is Nothing
    Wrong with Hating Rock Critics"" isn't a particularly memorable song, as Kevin Barnes' voice hovers somewhere
    between a strangely compelling, paranoid shriek, and his usual bell-clear delivery without ever fully
    delivering on the power of either.</p><p>
    
    With its fully rocked-out sound, ""There Is Nothing Wrong with Hating Rock Critics"" is pretty anomalous for
    <i>If He Is Protecting Our Nation</i>, most of which consists of a watered-down incarnation of this band's
    signature sound.  All the hyperactive Of Montreal chord changes, oddball lyrics, and off-kilter melodies are
    here, but the production is pretty thin throughout, and the melodies aren't nearly as strong as they've been
    on countless past releases.  ""What a Strange Day with a Swede"", ""Christmas Isn't Safe for Animals"" and ""An
    Ill-Treated Hiccups"" are all cohesive, well-conceived songs that suffer from the lack of a strong hook.</p><p>
    
    Even if they're not the catchiest in the Of Montreal catalog, these songs at least manage to convey Barnes'
    unique songwriting style in all its playfulness.  Throwaway tracks like the almost-tonal rock noodling of
    ""Barely Asian at the Beefcake Horizon"", the sped-up pseudo-skit ""Charlie and Freddy"", and a worthless
    bongos-n-bass ""beatnik"" reinterpretation of ""Mimi Merlot"" may have been fun to create, but offer little
    impetus for repeat listening.  <i>If He Is Protecting Our Nation</i> started out as a tour-only bonus album,
    and it sounds like one.  If you like Of Montreal enough to truly enjoy this album, odds are you've already
    picked it up.  If not, don't say you weren't warned.</p></div>"|5949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5949-if-he-is-protecting-our-nation-then-who-will-protect-big-oil-our-children/|5.3|Matt LeMay

    as it does the feature attraction.  But where DJ Force, guitarist Saguaro, and Tokyo underground legend Hoppy
    Kamiyama might concoct an ambience in common with Western space-mixers DJ Spooky or <i>Instrumentals</i>-era
    Mouse on Mars, their real talents seem closer to cinematic sound design.  Over the course of six albums
    (including soundtrack work), they've refined an identity well-suited to colors of bliss, exotica and quease--
    sometimes with the aid of sex and bondage imagery (try ""ass hole box"" as an instrument), though most often
    with a mere mastery of electronic textures.  Kamiyama's experience as a producer and arranger doesn't hurt,
    but as with many of the best Japanese bands today (and German ones from yesterday), it's the voice of one
    from many that resonates loudest.  Simply, The Saboten make a soft noise that, at its best, soothes the
    savage trip.</p><p>
<i>Beyond the Blue Heaven</i> does feature heady stuff-- especially on the opener, ""Helicoid Spume"".
    Beginning as a low murmur, the track takes its time revealing small details over a 30-minute course that
    ultimately seems shorter.  The bass-hum gradually exposes itself as the rattle of a slow-motion helicopter,
    and from the distance looms a high-pitched (but hardly piercing) digital whistle.  The pastel synth tones
    are like mist on an already moist pallet, and soon the whistle dissolves into runny static.  A human voice
    in the left channel manages a single syllable, panned across the mix, and before I have a chance to notice
    the volume has come up, the helicopter jumps an octave, and tower bells and some kind of intermittent
    jittering clang replace the synth tones.  Soon, the whirling, whipping blades of the machine jut out beyond
    the rest of the pack-- though not so much as to completely drown out the percolating vintage Cluster line
    in the left.  This is the kind of track that, from a distance, might seem a gigantic, spiraling mess, but
    it's pretty exhilarating from inside the eye of the storm.</p><p>
    So it's all the stranger that The Saboten should choose a nourish jazz piece as the other half of the record.
    ""NÖK"" blasts out of the gate with a full horn section and the percussion of Ruins leader Tatsuya Yoshida
    (who, for whatever reason, is quickly becoming the de facto Japanese ""jazz"" drummer).  They blare and bawl
    something fierce for a few moments, when suddenly everything drops, and a Fender Rhodes strums out a couple
    of cocktail lounge chords.  There's a little computer-driven feedback for spice, but when the horns come in,
    the vibe is obviously ""lowdown"" and ""bluesy.""  The contrast with the previous tune is a little jarring, but
    given that The Saboten tend to let their ideas wander off now and again, you have plenty of time to gather
    your wits.  Much of ""NÖK"" reminds me of John Zorn's experiments in noir-jazz, especially that of some of his
    <i>Filmworks</i> series.  Of course, when I asked Kamiyama about this music, he told me it was supposed to
    be a combination of Kraftwerk and Sun Ra, so who knows?</p><p>
    As an album, I'm not sure <i>Beyond the Blue Heaven</i> makes much sense, but in the scheme of most of these
    guys' careers, that's not really a criticism.  Truth be told, the second tune doesn't really even get going
    until midway through when it becomes a free-funk tune and everyone starts playing at once, so haphazard
    choices were probably the order of the day.  I might recommend a few other Kamiyama projects before this one,
    but where The Saboten win is in their dedication to milking a mood, and in making epic soundscapes seem like
    a walk in the park.</p></div>"|6959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6959-beyond-the-blue-heaven/|7.0|Dominique Leone

It's on the floor to stay, neither
    muffling its cheap-sex grunts nor apologizing for its shitty haircuts, shredded thrift store shirts, $200 pants, spiked wristbands, and trucker caps. Funny thing is, with all the trawling
    for irrelevant and/or relished treasures, this little crossbred genre that's finally come home to roost has been giving dissidents reason to pull up some other lost music not made by
    coke-loving third rate models. In what may be the only outpost of French love for the US at the moment (and vice-versa), Tigersushi not only functions as a website that namechecks
    the lost downtown groups, delves into fringe Village figures, weird hip-hop, the funkiest of Krautrockers and all the latest remixers but as a label, mashes genres into a great,
    rubbery wad. Taking all that knowledge down to the stoops and out on their rooftops, they dropped some serious pidgin shit in 5 EPs, jumbling old and new together in an electro
    tongue that's both an exclamation and a groan: \x93More Goddamned Music?!\x94</p><p>
    Famous for her opening turn on Andrew Weatherall's <i>Nine O'Clock Drop</i>-- one of the first comps to poke at the abandoned bum of  ""left-field disco""-- eurotrash warbler Gina X is in the
    lead-off slot again, taking a detached drum kick and Vicki the Robot vocals to offer up tribute to an English gentleman, with an attitude that resonates twenty years on,
    snotty and clear. The Bush Tetras' detuned tom thud of \x93Things That Go Boom in the Night\x94 gets further reduced by Alice Machine into reverberating finger snaps, loin-quivering low
    tones, and coy femme coos about being on the night-prowl.</p><p>
    It wouldx92t be French without some of their own bizarre contributions to the world of trashy fashion recordings tacked on, no matter how plastic. Going as far back as 1978 to document a
    bastard child of Gainsbourg's \x93Requiem Por Un Cox94 clopping on Superfly's lost roto-toms, a froggy Max Berlin gulps through ripples of melodica and synth wave into some illegitimate
    disco for \x93Elle et Moi\x94 that is quelle bizarre. Even in the shallow end of Ya-Ya girl babble in \x93Swinging Pool\x94, an homage to the Club Palace, it feels relatively deep today.</p><p>
    Old and new get confused, which is easier to preach than practice. The alien-abducted graffito of Chapter Three (which convenes somewhere between Sun Ra, Special Request, and
    Sugarhill Gang) brings the fresh-dork fusion of \x93Smurf Trek\x94, while Jamalski, beamed from the dying planet of BDP, gets to toast on top of \x93Extraterrestrial Manoeuvers in the Dark\x94, and
    it's as if time has slipped together. Acts like Metro Area retain their rain-slicked cool clacks and snapping clomps for \x93We Also Not\x94, even standing next to mid-nineties Detroit producer
    Terrence Parker, while relative newcomer Maurice Fulton leaves Stevie Wonder's floaties in <i>Tri Repetae</i>'s pool.</p><p>
    Least interesting is Silver Apples' one-trick pony, an oscillator perfect-pitched onto a banjo in the desktop recycle bin. Simeox92s track makes him out as a Charlie Kaufman-type,
    cantankerously babbling to his girlfriend about salad for four minutes. On the other hand, Tigersushi does present the first swatch of Bill Laswell's Material that doesx92t make me
    nauseous-- in fact this hot shit track has me rethinking my whole take on the man.  That they glean Cluster's creamy \x93Hollywood\x94 for the finale-- so epic in its electro splendor-- auguring
    G-ride frequencies on a \x93Flight of the Valkyries\x94 type of trip is leaving the goddamned best for last.</p></div>"|2008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2008-more-gdm/|7.4|Andy Beta

I disagree.  But then, I've always tended towards indulgence, and I like it when authors (or bands or artists) layer a bunch of other people's words atop their own text, offering various paths to their own creation.</p><p>  Thankfully, the Panthers are similarly unafraid of affixing disparate textual voices to their work.  No matter which member you tap, the Brooklyn-based band has all sorts of rock pedigree: Justin Chearno was in Turing Machine and Pitchblende (and he did some stuff with Unrest, too) and Kip Uhlhorn was a member of The Red Scare. But if you asked me to choose which parent the band resembles most, I'd have to point at vocalist Jayson Green, guitarist Geoff Garlock, and drummer Jeff Salene, all ex-members of Orchid, a band that carried (and tossed) the flames of Guy Debord and Born Against into the late 1990s.</p><p>  Sure, some people found Orchid heavy-handed. Why not? They quoted lengthily from Albert Camus and Jacques Attali. They peppered song titles with references to intellectual movements (""Snow Delay at the Frankfurt School""), applied theories to the lives of angry, good-humored punk-rock kids (""Let's Commodify Sexuality"", ""Discourse of Desire""), and the lyrics themselves were engagingly over-the-top: ""I kiss the girls that speak Marcuse/ I kiss the boys that speak Foucault"" (""Tigers"").  As inspired and fun as I found Green's rants, the thing about Orchid that really allowed them to transcend the label of unsmiling crusty anarchists were their love/sex songs, their humor, and their desire to get folks dancing.  And this is where the Panthers pick up the ball and start jogging on <em>Let's Get Serious</em>.</p><p>  Yeah, they jog. Perhaps taking their name from John Sinclair's White Panther movement, or maybe the Black Panthers, or even the pink bastard himself, the Panthers still toss around epigraphs by French theorists, gangster rappers, and Situationist poets galore; and Green is still on about sexism, fascism, fucking, and being a dick; but the lyrics (and overall political approach) seem less confrontational. It's like the emotive angst of the early years has given way to a bit too much rhetoric. More sinuous and less angry than last year's <em>Are You Down?</em>, the new songs manage to move beyond the pit and onto the dancefloor, yet, through the tepid lyrical flow, it sometimes seems like the revolution itself has become a nervous wallflower.</p><p>  ""Thank Me with Your Hands"", the first and strongest track here, is David Yow in a romantic mood. Somehow it also cops a slight feel from George Michael's ""Monkey"" (trust me on this). It's a warped, multi-layered MC5 shouting spree with some nice shit about slang and sleeping: ""I was thinking we should sleep in separate beds, but the heat's gone to my head/ Let's get tired at the same time (tonight)."" More blues than Orchid ever mustered, it's the Laughing Hyenas or some Am Rep band from back in the day; each guitar line's a trampoline, lifting the song to higher levels until things explode into total rock-out ballistics.</p><p>  Equally rich, ""It's Not the Heat It's the Humility"" is noteworthy for a weird drum fill that sounds like a violent beatdown and the placement of Notorious B.I.G.'s ""I don't know what's more important: my ego or yours"" just above it. The vocal line and lyrics are a bit tired (some late-80s battle of theory and praxis, indeterminability, and death of the author), but the guitars, again, totally rock. There's also a change during the last minute that brings overdriven Moog and vibraphone to the fore: somewhere amid the sheet of noise there's baritone sax, trumpet, and tenor sax. Fuck Rye Coalition, son, this is what the excess of the 1970s should've led us towards!</p><p>  ""Post-Fascist Fantasies"", which again has fairly throwaway lyrics, offers (to draw further parallels with The Jesus Lizard) an angular guitar line straight from the book of Duane Denison and, as with the other tracks, plenty of percussion (feedback, hand claps, and shakers). On ""Sexist Not Sexy"" the guitar tracks are upfront, kicking things through the wall and floor-- plus, there's pretty noise at the end: twisting buzzes stop and start, panning in the left speaker, and then tear the sheetrock into powder.  Meanwhile, the final track, ""Don't Be a Dick"", offers this: ""My trousers have a nice pleat/ And I enjoy my method of self-defeat/ It suits me..."" The record needs more personalized flourishes like that.</p><p>  All in all, <em>Let's Get Serious</em> is grimy, fuzzed-out goodness, and while the aural trumps the textual time and again (I found myself caring less what the songs were about, and for a band like this that's a crucial slip), it's notable that the Panthers can coast by on rock alone: this is, after all, a mighty rad rock record.  Still, they have the depth of thought to take it further than this.  Maybe next time, if they amp the political angst as loudly as the guitars, the revolution of the everyday will finally have its proper soundtrack.</p><p> </p></div>"|6150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6150-lets-get-serious-ep/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

    album that wasn't exactly loved by everybody when it first hit the file-trading circuit.  Admired and
    enjoyed?  Sure, but mostly, mixed or lukewarm reactions to the record slowly grew into devotion.  It took
    me a lot of listens before <i>Yoshimi</i>'s silly, sometimes childlike songs revealed themselves as a
    heartbreaking meditations on life and death.  Not to tug your heartstrings, but I lost a loved one around
    the time I bought this album; now I can't hear it without getting a little choked up.  How many modern
    artists could give us such a personal take on accepting mortality, and then throw balloons all over it?</p><p>
    
    Certainly not Cat Stevens, whose weepy, pedantic ""Father and Son"" provided the melody for ""Fight Test""--
    one of the Lips' greatest songs, and the centerpiece of this post-<i>Yoshimi</i> EP.  Granted, the band
    admits to cribbing the tune, and yes, the lyrics are disarmingly simple; read literally, the song is just
    about a couple guys fighting over a girl.  But saying this is ""just"" a pop song is like saying a classic
    Roman arch is a pile of stone with a slit up the middle.  ""Fight Test"" is majestically architected.  It
    speaks so purely about an idea-- steeling yourself up for something you don't want to face-- that it can
    resonate with anyone, especially as Wayne Coyne's empathic vocals ride Dave Fridmann's finest flying saucer
    production and bold orchestration.</p><p>
    
    That's the only song on the <i>Fight Test</i> EP that isn't new; it's followed by six live and rare tracks--
    including a set of cover songs recorded for radio sessions, selected from the promo-only offering <i>Yoshimi
    Wins!</i>  Unfortunately, the novelty factor of hearing the Lips tackle other people's pop hits counts for
    more than what they do to them.  It's as if Wayne told the guys, ""Hey, why don't you go hose out the rabbit
    suits?  I'm gonna stay here and knock out these arrangements.""  We start with Kylie Minogue's disco-tech
    smash ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"", which is slowed to a dirge and buried under maudlin organ.  It's an
    effective way to bring out the desperation in the lyrics, but I'd rather hear the Lips turn up the beat
    and knock this track on its ass.  Their performance of Beck's ""The Golden Age"", meanwhile, is as solid but
    submissive as you'd expect from, well, Beck's backing band.</p><p>
    
    Then you have Radiohead's ""Knives Out"", an interesting band for the Lips to set themselves against.  In
    these troubled times, a lot of rock fans are sitting around waiting for some band to hand over the perfect
    protest song, one short ditty that could somehow encapsulate everything that's wrong with the world today.
    But sometimes we forget the few bands-- including Radiohead and The Flaming Lips-- who have given us a more
    nuanced response to the state of the world (or at least to the mental state of their fans).  And while
    Radiohead treads on gloomier themes, the Lips take the opposite tact of emboldening the individual: Wayne
    Coyne's like your coach, and the game is to not let your head detonate when you turn on the news.  So,
    what does this clash of important bands yield?  Sadly, not much-- the Lips' fuzziness and squawking guitar
    are, at best, a very weird substitute for Radiohead's tense, insistent rhythms.</p><p>
    
    After the covers comes the only other <i>Yoshimi</i> track, ""Do You Realize??"", which has been remixed and
    rendered club-friendly by DJ-of-the-moment-five-minutes-ago Scott Hardkiss (really, it could as easily have
    been John Digweed, Timo Maas, or Danny Tenaglia).  Hardkiss's treatment makes the band's ""happy death song""
    longer and brighter, but somehow, the lyrics lose their punch without the over-the-top production of the
    original.  And ""The Strange Design of Conscience""-- one of two brand-new tracks-- almost reaches <i>Yoshimi</i>-level
    meditations, but is too wordy and relies too much on blips and bloops than broad strokes or sharp hooks.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the final track fares far better than the rest of the entire disc (title track excepted):
    ""Thank You Jack White (For the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)"" is a little ditty that recounts the
    time they were playing in Detroit, and The White Stripes frontman came backstage to give them a present.
    [Note to Ryan: Tell the newswire they can relax-- we just made our Jack White reference quota for today.]
    While on the surface it seems like a throwaway track, the lyrics are funnier, the melody catchier and the
    entire song better thought-out than it needed to be.  The songwriting, in fact, hearkens back to a much
    earlier Flaming Lips period-- the oft-glazed-over <i>Transmissions from the Satellite Heart</i> era, back
    when the band was more concerned with goofy, feelgood pop songs than beautiful, grandiose statements.</p><p>
    
    Still, I think I speak for most fans when I wonder why Warner opted for this track selection over an
    official release for all the great songs recorded during the <i>Yoshimi</i> sessions that didn't make
    the album.  ""Up Above the Daily Hum"", ""Funeral in My Head"", the Japanese version of the title track,
    and all the others are generally accepted to be on par with any of the album's eleven existing cuts.
    They may be available on import singles, but since this will likely be the only <i>Yoshimi</i> companion
    piece to receive a U.S. release, it would be nice if they'd issued them all together in one place, or
    even expanded this disc to a mini-LP to make room for them.</p><p>
    
    Coasting mainly on novelty tunes, this EP isn't exactly essential listening.  But then again, if the Lips
    only stuck to what's essential, they'd have a much cheaper stage show and a much less giddy fanbase.
    Anyone who wants to keep the <i>Yoshimi</i> party rolling will enjoy it.  And as a bonus, there's a
    multimedia portion with the (kind of dull, I'm afraid) ""Fight Test"" video, and a five-minute trailer for
    the band's long-awaited <i>Christmas on Mars</i> film.  Will the film couple its silliness with the rigor
    of their best work, or will it, like this disc, turn out to be a fans-only vanity project?  To compare
    them once again to their peers, at least their flick'll be a hell of a lot more fun than Radiohead's or
    Wilco's.  Bring on the alien Santa Claus autopsy!</p></div>"|3083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3083-fight-test-ep/|6.5|Chris Dahlen

Nothing is more humbling to this
    supposed music expert than the experience of downloading a high-rated album by a Fennesz or a Whitman, only
    to be confronted with head-scratching experimentalism my pop-lovin' head can't even begin to wrap around,
    like sampling a drug and not understanding what the big deal is.  I wouldn't dare think that the reviewers
    who celebrated the music were, in fact, wrong, due to the highly eloquent and clearly passionate writing it
    inspired in them, so instead I face the fact that I'm almost always going to enjoy reading a Richardson
    review more than I would enjoy the music he was writing about.</p><p>
    But with Sonic Youth, it's not so simple keeping the noise segregated out of my sight and off my hard drive.
    Having developed in an avant-garde culture with the likes of Glenn Branca, the band has generally made no
    easy separation between their ha-ha-""accessible"" content and the more difficult material in their catalog.
    And as a dutiful fan, I give most everything a shot, including the obtuse-as-fuck SYR series (""what is this,
    a field recording from inside a vacuum?"").</p><p>
    Now this soundtrack for the French arthouse film, <i>Demonlover</i>-- which is certainly <i>not</i> to be
    confused with the 1985 flop, <i>My Demon Lover</i>, starring latter-day <i>Family Ties</i> star Scott
    Valentine-- is the next test of my  SY-devotion and patience.  By my count, it's their third work for the
    screen, after the early noodling scorework for <i>Made in USA</i> (the reissue of which my 14-year-old self
    was duly suckered into buying) and the actually quite nice strip mall desolation music for Eric Bogosian's
    woefully-dated slacker opera <i>SubUrbia</i>. <i>Demonlover</i>'s plot, something about virtual reality porn
    involving Gina Gershon, sounds fit for late-night Cinemax rotation, but the Youth's soundtrack is hardly
    bwom-bwom-chikka wood-paneling and waterbed music.</p><p>
    The leadoff track, ""Move Away"", sounds like an abstract Sonic Youth project I can get into, despite Kim
    moving back towards the demented cheerleader style of vocals that was thankfully absent from <i>Murray
    Street</i>.  With an easy, laid-back, funkish three-guitar groove (read: wah-wah pedals), softly purring
    feedback, and Steve Shelley keeping a steady, grounding beat, it's got the kind of improvisational flair
    I've always hoped for out of SY-- a way to reconcile my childhood love for a happy jammy band that shall
    remain nameless with my more ma-toor appreciation for the indie rock.</p><p>
    After this enticing slice, however, <i>Demonlover</i> moves off into quiet, ambient drone territory, which,
    as we've already established, is rather frightening and alien to this reviewer.  But now, in my professional
    capacity as a critic of musical oddities, I've buckled down and given it a shot, trying it out in different
    environs, hoping to unlock the secret of the noise.  Cranked up on headphones, I'll admit it gave a late-night
    walk to the video store a rather cinematic feel, feedback curling like the manhole smoke.  On my harsh-lit
    morning subway ride, the more mechanical sounds blended with the heavy machinery whir around me.  Before
    bed, it, well, put me to sleep-- not necessarily a bad thing, considering I once fell asleep at a Sigur Rós
    show and loved it.</p><p>
    But despite all these incidences of context-enriching, I still find it difficult to say I actually <em>enjoy</em>
    listening to <i>Demonlover</i>.  For starters, the ramshackle, rhythmless percussion found on most tracks
    (""Control Freak"", ""Teknikal Illprovisation"") conjures up the same old train imagery I always get from
    abstract pieces, leading me to conclude I either had some profound pre-memory experience with trains, or
    that the textures here are not exactly groundbreaking if they sound familiar to me.</p><p>
    While I wouldn't make the foolish assumption that the songs on <i>Demonlover</i> are dashed-off, many strike
    me as profoundly unfinished, like blocks of marble left partially unsculpted.  ""Control Freak"", in its second
    half, blooms into a delicate interplay of riffs that sound like they'll explode any minute into a <i>Daydream
    Nation</i> epic... but then the track just ends.  ""Electric Noisefield"" and ""Superdead"" could be the
    exhilarating exploratory sections in the middle of any number of SY tracks, but without melodic bookends
    they seem overly weightless.  A handful of the sonic canvases whipped up by the band are at least
    surface-interesting, but am I alone in thinking that the addition of Jim O'Rourke to the lineup detracts
    somehow from their mystical edge in projects like this, eliminating the ubiquitous ""wow, this is all guitars?!""
    response?</p><p>
    Given the confessional nature of this review, it'd be more than fair to say that I'm probably not the best
    person to review this album.  And really, without experiencing these compositions in the context of the film
    for which they were created, perhaps nobody is really capable of judging the competency of this material.
    But Sonic Youth must know that they have a spectrum of fans, ranging from those who bought <i>Dirty</i> on
    a Cobain rec, to those who think everything since the <i>Sonic Death</i> bootleg has been a sellout.  I'd
    plot myself somewhere in the middle (you know, that SYR vacuum track <em>is</em> kinda cool), and I can't help
    but find <i>Demonlover</i> not only over my head, but a little bit on the dull side.</p><p>
    Appendix: <i>Demonlover</i> also features a track each from Goldfrapp, Death in Vegas, Dub Squad, and Soulfly.
    Disappointingly, none are collaborations with Sonic Youth as my MP3 files suggested, and they're all pretty
    expendable, ranging from the kitschy Bond theme of Goldfrapp's ""Lovely Head"" to the absolutely godawful
    goatee rap-rock of Soulfly's ""Back to the Primitive"".  Though come to think of it, a hot 3D sex scene set
    to Soulfly would probably be a lot sexier than one accompanied by ""Electric Noisefield"".</p></div>"|7346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7346-demonlover-ost/|5.1|Rob Mitchum

That's the name of the <i>Valley Girl</i> actress who later became the singer in the band that
    played various film proms: <i>Better Off Dead</i>, <i>Summer School</i>, some other shit. She did that 80s
    dance where her bobbing head, cocked arm, snapping hand, and suede-booted leg all moved in the same direction
    at the same time. She had Jersey mall hair. She was cool. Most of all, she had the most underrated film
    voice in history, a scratchy, scrappy, sandpapery bark. Elizabeth Daily's brilliantly craggy chirp-- the one
    that sang the line, ""I'd be better off dead/ Than to live without you!"" so passionately-- is now relegated to
    low-rent anime on American television and the occasional Nickelodeon film. God is fucking dead, people.</p><p>
    Maria Andersson, she's the lead singer in Sahara Hotnights, the Swedish four-girl garage rock band for whom
    America freaked its shit after the stateside release of their second full-length album, <i>Jennie Bomb</i>.
    Snarling, cool-smart-and-driving-'82-Monte-Carlo-real-fast kinda stuff peeled out of that record with a
    U-Haul of suave and sass: The Runaways, but better prepared. It reeked like cigarettes. Even with the vague
    stench of Def Leppard, Foreigner and Survivor's leather/pyro tunes, that record's focus was its masterful
    sneering riffage. It made chix visualize throwing punches as an assertion of their all-encompassing tuffness.
    Some of us, in fact, did so.</p><p>
    Sahara Hotnights' ""Alright Alright (Here's My Fist Where's the Fight?)"", from <i>Jennie Bomb</i>, made it
    onto soundtracks, but it's on their newly reissued first proper record, <i>C'mon Let's Pretend</i>, that
    Andersson sounds like the totally badassical Scandinavian incarnation of Elizabeth Daily. Shittier production
    quality, less anthemic assertion, and possibly the presence of weird guitar pedals (""Push on Some More"" is
    dressed with a sorta gothic flanger) allow Ms. Andersson's vox to have a singular presence that got lost in
    <i>Jennie Bomb</i>'s foggy urgency. That presence is craggy, vibrato-laden, overly dramatic, and has ingested
    more stray droplets of Aquanet than Lita Ford in the years '87-'88: i.e., Elizabeth Daily. The only thing
    missing is the dance, which Andersson eschews in favor of muscle-y precision fretwork. Whatever; this time
    it'll have to do.</p><p>
    But it's almost an entirely different band, this <i>C'mon Let's Pretend</i>-era Sahara Hotnights-- and in
    certain ways, it's a more original one. Unique embellishments extend beyond flange, in the form of breathless
    teenaged harmonies (""Too Cold for You""), grittier, more depressive songwriting (the surfy swagger of ""Drive
    Dead Slow"", ""Impressed by Me""), and forlorn, Axl-invoking ballads (""Our Very Own"", ""I Know Exactly What to
    Do"")-- less worldly, with a wider stylistic range. They weren't locked in to being a Garage Rock Band at
    that point, which resulted in a raw selection of arena weepers on par with Poison's ""Something to Believe
    In"", Lita &amp; Ozzy's ""Close My Eyes Forever"" and Def Leppard's ""Photograph"".</p><p>
    In 1999, Sahara Hotnights were well on their way to being the featured band at the stoner prom. I like that
    melodic innocence better than their current Pelle-tainted rocker persona.  <i>C'mon</i> was written before
    they left their tiny Swedish hometown, so it has the unfiltered angst and itchy friction of four chicks who
    just wanted to get the eff out.  It was written before they got all cynical from American tours, critical
    bonerz, and too many dudes disclaiming their guitar heroics with ""and they're hot, too."" It's the sound of
    innocence, like night-long basement parties spent listening to cheesy 80s rock records: derivative in a
    naïve tributary fashion, while still glimmering with songwriting promise. You won't wanna throw a punch,
    but you can visualize the possibility.</p></div>"|6968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6968-cmon-lets-pretend/|6.8|Julianne Shepherd

     in the door as part of the post-Nirvana alterna-signing sweepstakes, arriving too late to cash in on the opportunity.  Where that might
     be enough to discourage an average rocker, inviting the certain state of laziness that so often results from near-successes, Whitten reinvented himself as 
     glam-rock savior well ahead of the current revivalist trend-- except now that he's perfected the style, it's already a casualty of overexposure and
     style-over-substance bandwagon-jumpers.</p><p>
     
    So when Whitten sings that the ""21st century/ Bores the hell out of me"" on ""Duty Free"", I'm inclined to believe him, because what better way to
    erase time's relevance from the equation but to live in the past, a past where Marc Bolan still swaggers to the bang of a gong, Lou Reed still 
    can't decide whether he'd rather score speed or chase transvestites, and the Replacements weren't even a twinkle in papa Alex Chilton's eye.</p><p>
    
    Still, all the dramatic nostalgia in the world is useless unless the songs are there to back it up, and that's where Whitten has surpassed his previous
    two outings with Grand Mal.  All eleven tracks on <em>Bad Timing</em> are gems that balance a knack for brain-lodging choruses with the grime and
    stylistic drift of <em>Exile on Main Street</em>, begging a record collection's worth of comparisons with nary an instance of outright thievery.  Whitten's lyrics are 
    about as sharp as they come-- lines like ""She says I look like a fascist/ With my black mustaches"" (""Old Fashioned""), ""She was standin' on the corner/ Smokin' 
    marijuana/ Drinkin' Hi-C"" (""Duty Free""), and ""She was a first round knockout/ She was a beauty school dropout/ She was full from the fat of the land"" (""1st Round K.O."") 
    just skim the surface of the singer's knack for unlikely rhymes and clever turns of phrase.  He even manages to adopt an impartial narrative style on tracks like 
    ""Disaster Film"" that packs more gritty urban drama into five minutes than Dick Wolf can spew forth in an entire season of <em>Law &amp; Order</em> spinoffs.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Dave ""You might remember me from such productions as <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>, <i>Deserter's Songs and <em>Hate</em>"" Fridmann's presence
    behind the boards certainly doesn't hurt.  Though Fridmann has worked with Whitten regularly, dating back to the St. Johnny days, <em>Bad Timing</em> is
    the first record where they've really connected on a visionary level. Fridmann seems to consciously avoid going the heavily orchestrated route
    that has worked so well with the Lips and Mercury Rev, instead allowing Whitten to stick to the rawk while adding just enough sonic tweaks to warp
    things out of the ordinary-- unless female backup singers that sound as if they've been duct-taped into the mix or slide guitar disguised as a
    gobbling turkey don't qualify as unusual anymore.</i></p><p>
    
    The only real problem that Whitten has to contend with now is keeping a band together long enough to take this new batch of songs on the road-- he's 
    the only member of the current five-piece Grand Mal lineup that even played on this record.  As of this writing there's still room at the end
    of the coattails for another New York band or two, but in a year, as elephants represent the best that indie rock <em>and</em>
    US politics to the masses, Whitten's <em>Bad Timing</em> may-- regrettably-- find him slipping through the cracks of consequence yet again.</p></div>"|3542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3542-bad-timing/|8.0|Scott Hreha

Far from the rocking follow-up to his chair-breaking
    2002 release, <i>Where Shall You Take Me</i> is as distant as Jurado can travel without ending up in the same place (the token rocker, \x93Texas to Ohio\x94, is like Alejandro Escovedo's most
    annoying moment, but not quite as well executed).  The sparse and largely unobtrusive music, and Jurado's wanting vocal range place the emphasis on storytelling, one his
    strongest assets.  The results, however, are a mixed bag.</p><p>
    He begins by trying to shock us to attention.  The snappy first line trick would have to be pretty damn snappy to top Crooked Fingers' \x93Blurry eyes/ Half-bent/ And I can't
    take you sober,\x94 but \x93First came a scream/ Blood on the floor/ The alcohol and magazines\x94 gives the trick a fairly decent whack.  You have to love the old standby, a porn/murder ballad.
    Despite how it outlines Jurado's stunning ability to stack moving images into a pliable story (\x93Smile for the camera/ Take off that dress/ $20 for a kiss\x94), Jurado overreaches on \x93Amateur Night\x94.
    The quasi-cinematic monotone crescendo that begins midway through never pans out: the story isn't \x93real\x94 enough to be genuinely disturbing, and a half-assed attempt at trying to humanize the
    protagonist (\x93I am not an evil man/ I just have a habit I can't kick\x94) derails anything he was building up to.  Jurado's stacking technique works best with image collages; his similar portrayal
    of actions make the story a series of connecting lines without reference dots, rather than dots without connecting lines.  The latter invigorates the imagination. The former is simply frustrating.</p><p>
    Two distinct threads unify the album: the aforementioned \x93creepy\x94 motif, and an at once endearing and annoying faux-naïve peasant idyllic, both of which yield varying degrees of
    success.  \x93Omaha\x94, for example, presents a desert wasteland, sparely peppered with half-dying saguaro mope-core acoustics yearning for a late monsoon.  \x93Tether,\x94 on the other hand,
    undercuts its pleasant naivety with the proper use of \x93whom\x94.  ""Abiline\x94 is a lovely little lullaby and the most adult contemporary song on what's in many ways an adult contemporary album
    (a characterization due mainly to piano work that invokes Bruce Hornsby).</p><p>
    \x93Window\x94 is stark naked Americana, and proves to be the most effective invocation of his idyllic mode, in the same way as senior alt-contempo master Ryan Adams'  \x93In My Time of Need\x94-- in fact
    it's pretty much the same damn song. \x93I Can't Get Over You\x94 works as a sequel to \x93Window\x94, but that's about it; featuring the album's most predictable guitar work and lyrics like
    \x93I've tried sleeping/ Just to get over you/ I have tried dreaming/ But all of my thoughts were of you/ Oooooh whooooo,\x94 he fails in the same vein he succeeded on the previous track.</p><p>
    \x93Intoxicated Hands\x94 is the album's highlight, despite some annoying vocal processing, and provides the ass to cash the check of \x93Amateur Night\x94.   A whirlwind of phantasmagoric vocal
    layering, flashes of lust and jealousy, and snippets of frantic, obsessive mania slap the listener from every direction: it is all the atmosphere and confusion of <i>Amore de Tropico</i>
    compressed into one song.  I have no idea what the hell is going on, but I desperately want to; like some disembodied spirit floating through different bodies, adopting their perspective
    momentarily and then moving on, Jurado's shifts through first, second and third persons reveal a stark betrayal, if little else.</p><p>
<i>Where Shall You Take Me?</i> may be one of the most aptly titled albums in recent memory, but Jurado does lead us on a worthwhile journey.  With the exception of ""Matinee"", most of filler is
    forgivable, and the music, while not innovative, is lovely. His storytelling has a ways to go before I'll follow along with baited breath, but his ambitious songwriting-- while not brilliant-- places him
    well above your average troubadour.</p></div>"|4323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4323-where-shall-you-take-me/|7.2|Daniel Crumb

     filed out of Seattle's Showbox Theater sweaty, confounded, and  wholly satisfied, eyes glazed and shoes untied.  But the 
     actual, fleshy experience is entirely  irrelevant to its recorded counterpart: as a live release, the  Murder City Devils' posthumous 
     and aptly titled <i>R.I.P.</i> is a tiring,  sloppy failure.  In some ways, that's the point-- by 2001, the Devils had made 
     a career out of ballsy  metal-punk garage posturing, and their final performance maintains that spirit to an absurd degree-- 
     but it's not enough make <i>R.I.P.</i>  worth its weight in fake blood and chicken bones.</p><p>
     
     On 2001's <i>Thelema</i>, the Devils stopped smashing beer bottles long enough to give fans a quick glimpse of their songwriting 
     potential, featuring some decent melodies and a lot more attention to instrumentation-- and structure-- than their previous 
     albums. But shortly after its release, the  band disintegrated mid-tour: keyboardist Leslie Hardy and bassist Derek Fudesco 
     abruptly fled the group, and the remaining members (Nate Manny, Dan Gallucci, Coady Willis, Nick  DeWitt, Moody, and Gabe-the-Roadie) 
     agreed to dissipate forever  following a final hometown gig. Unfortunately, what could have been the ultimate swansong for a band 
     seventy minutes away from self-destruction plays more like a half-hearted, obligatory spurt from a tired, lifeless, group bored with their 
     own gimmicky sludge.</p><p>
     
     As a collection of songs, <i>R.I.P.</i> is completely (and self- consciously) incoherent.  It's also a physically distressing, head-
     twitching experience, opening with vocalist Spencer Moody slurring ""I hope we don't disappoint!"" before thirty drawn-out seconds of flat, 
     monotonous electric guitar wail, followed by a viscous, gooey glop of power chords and banging drumbeats.  This is 
     the instantly forgettable ""Bear Away"". </p><p>
     
     Pretty Girls Make Graves frontwoman Andrea Zollo (DeWitt and Fudesco are now card-carrying members of PGMG) lends some 
     shockingly expert vocals to ""Boom Swagger"", although it seems safe to assume she-- like everyone else-- was properly trashed (think of 
     the Yeah Yeah Yeah's Karen O. not even trying to keep the Corona in her mouth while howling onstage); ""Boom Swagger"" is 
     the highlight of <i>R.I.P.</i>, thick with palpable sexual energy, muscular (if boring) guitar thrashing, and creepy (if 
     belabored) organ lines.  MCD chose to close their set (and their collective career) with a new song, ""Grace That Saves"", 
     although there's nothing especially different about its dark, heavy guitars, throaty, unmelodic screams, and 
     aggressive percussion.  Wait, scratch that-- there's totally extra screaming on this one! Man that's loud!</p><p>
     
     Whether the Murder City Devils actually disappointed their fans that night is impossible to determine now.  They 
     had always been a band that aspired to a very specific kind of musical mediocrity-- more pomp, gore, and black leather than 
     ingenuousness-- and even the album's liner notes admit ""Good musicianship never goes out of style. Well, we had one shot, and we 
     blew it.""  Still, any clear-headed Ramones fan knows that ""good musicianship"" isn't necessarily the cornerstone of a fine rock 
     band; what the Ramones lacked in chops they more than made up for with heart, inventiveness, and character.  The Murder City 
     Devils don't display any such stuff here, and that, at least, will be enormously disappointing to anyone who shells out $12 for their 
     send-off CD. </p><p>
     
    As with almost anything certifiably worthless, a perverse beauty emerges from the midst of crap: this record is so brazenly 
     bad that it's almost-- <i>almost</i>-- good, mostly because of the obviousness of its faults: out of tune guitars, broken and/or 
     exploding microphones, shit-faced band and audience members tackling each another, drum sets toppling, spotty sound, peripheral 
     noise, indecipherable vocals, and plenty of beer-fueled pontificating.  <i>R.I.P.</i> has a kind of entirely credible kiss-my-ass 
     swagger that, while you're tossing the disc in the trash, will perhaps allow for a tiny, fleeting ""Those wily little fuckers!"" grin.  
     After that, you will never, ever think about the Murder City Devils again. MDC: R.I.P.</p></div>"|5508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5508-rip/|3.0|Amanda Petrusich

There are     wicked edges to each syllable, but there's a viscous soul to it that seeps in where the barbs have already drawn blood. Which is peculiar, as the song itself is a nasty, bashing sort of punk     number, the lyrics asking, \x93Are you stupid, or just a faggot?\x94 It's the Dicks, of course, one of the most powerful Texas punk bands ever to arise, at the same time as the Big Boys and the Butthole     Surfers, before singer Gary Floyd-- the gargantuan punk-rock queen from which this powerful voice emanated-- pulled up stakes to the more accepting climes in San Francisco. With the less chain-     gang Sister Double Happiness, he preceded the grunge genre by a few years, keeping a soulful edge to their sludgy rock. A touchstone for the likes of Nirvana, the Jesus     Lizard, and Mudhoney (the last two covering Dicks' songs), Floyd has lain low the past few years, as punk cred don't exactly pay Pacific Gas.</p>
<p>That he's paired now with Mushroom, a bunch of left Coast groovers and movers, is less a respectful resurrection than an inspired match. Comprised of players who've dabbled with folks     such as Beth Orton, Beck, Faust, and Kevin Ayers, they have always been capable of summoning speed-crisped 60s soul, 70s fusion synth stacks, and 90s Tortoise wax buffing all the     crags to a sheen, but with Floyd, they fill in that missing decade of the 80s, with his hardcore heart. Happy enough to contemplate their omphalos while zoning out to Herbie Hancock's     <i>Headhunters</i> or Daevid Allex92s <i>Gong</i>, Mushroom veers more towards early seventies AM Gold with such a formidable front man, while still trudging up the old Fillmore West in     all its incestuous glory and excess.</p>
<p>Divining Joe Cocker, Floyd gives you just enough time to hit the black lights and crash into the bean bag before Mushroom takes off with the cringingly titled \x93The Revolution     Will Not Be Televised, but It Will Be Auctioned Off on eBay\x94. That it works better than it reads by lava lamp is crucial, for they do take their sweet-ass time reaching expansion, wading through     flute and trumpet morass before revealing their secret weapon: Monoshock and Glands of External Secretion tweaker Doug Pearson. Pearsox92s synthesizer is the x-factor for most of the     tracks, extracting the psychoactive purities that lace their originals and covers, coating it all in electric Kool-Aid meltdown. On Curtis Mayfield's \x93Pushermax94 he is both street-level truck     brakes and uncut space dust, squirting tracers around Floyd's falsetto and leather take on the gay hustler, concerned more with his own tricks than on ruining the ghetto. That the signature     conga line drops into a lock at the end with the Can patter of Patrick O'Hearn Thomas (also doubling as producer of the sessions) gives their cover a much more potent effect.</p>
<p>\x93Even the Beatles Had Beards\x94, the other Mushroom original, decelerates into a Traffic jam, with harmonica and organ cutting through with the Doppler effect of late-night ambulances,     smoothing away all memories of a front man, but when Floyd belts back at the ARP blats of the Who b-side \x93Water\x94, his presence pulls the proceedings back from the tarpit of noodling     these chops always teeter over, saving the group from falling in with the other dinosaurs. That Carrie Nation nymphets could be reborn to shimmy for the likes of the Spencer Davis     Group, Steppenwolf, Leon Russell and Randy California is less about the Mushroom's session-cat ability to cough up long-haired balls of past glories than the dollar bin detritus     coursing through Floyd's rough, corrugated throat, scuffing it up just enough to take hold on the way down.</p></div>"|5520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5520-mad-dogs-and-san-franciscans/|7.0|Andy Beta

<p>""...we're the luckiest people in the world because *stop* this is just gonna *stop* make us stronger and     stronger as *stop* it goes on and on...""</p>
<p>The true meaning behind this desultory phrase-- sampled from either a discussion between a jailed man and     his estranged wife, or excerpted from the most insecure brothel relationship ever-- may never be known to     anyone outside the band, but it carries transparent connotations regarding the recording process that's     eagerly flaunted on both this release and the band's previous: their records were made in ""self-imposed     isolation, with the band operating in states of little or no sleep, varying levels of intoxication, and     in physical confinement.""</p>
<p>Aligning themselves with various other shut-in luminaries such as Amon Düül and Faust, the band undoubtedly     view the euphoric and analgesic power of narcotics and somnambulism as a one-way ticket to the underground,     an idea closely tied to the Cage-ian fueled notion of aleatoric music.  From this tradition, Set Fire to     Flames emphasize their steadfast belief in the principle that music stems forth from the natural gamble of     improvisational/inspirational jamming and the found-sound principles of musique concrète.  One need only     listen to their last album <i>Sings Reign Rebuilder</i> in its entirety to understand the basis for this     belief, but unfortunately the adage of lightning rarely striking twice endures, as their latest effort is     hardly as cohesive or stunning a composition.</p>
<p>""Déja, Comme des Trous de Vent, Comme Reproduit"" begins strongly enough, with the return to form suggested     by the title.  Intermingling a rolling guitar and a staccato bassline, a uniform hum swallows the song,     building to a deafening crescendo before petering out with the words, ""Small steps against inertia... echo a     dead end.""  The song then proceeds at a protracted pace, which regrettably establishes the tempo for the     majority of the first disc.  Used as an amalgamated experimental device, the sounds of rustling and torn     pages, keys rattling into a rusty ignition, and various other concrete noises can become a sonic accent     that makes or breaks a song, but standing alone for such extended periods of time with little-to-no     accompaniment sounds forced and musically without nuance.  Even the slight return of Lyingdyingwonderbody,     a recurring character from the first album, seems trite and misplaced as the disembodied voice expounds     upon how he's forced to escape various deadly situations, before the track dissolves into another round of     generic industrial noises and cavernous roars.</p>
<p>Of course, there are still moments of brilliance scattered throughout the work, but they're inevitably     crushed by the weight of the double album itself.  The beautiful and dense ""When Sorrow Shoots Her Darts""     begins with a playful tune that's traded in counterpoint between the guitar and violin, as a strong     percussive element builds before quickly fading into ""Kill Fatigue Frequencies"", which offers what sounds     like a brief piece for the glass harmonica. ""Rites of Spring Reverb"" and ""Something About Eva Mattes in the     Halo of Exploding Street Lamps..."" both offer a display of melodic songwriting, memorable and complex in     their use of overlapping instrumentation and extended techniques.  Throughout their innovations these     tracks manage to avoid most elements of excess, which is unfortunately more than compensated for in such     inexplicably long and underdeveloped tracks as ""In Prelight Isolate"" and ""Sleep Maps"".</p>
<p>To the band's credit, these moments of musical gluttony are more a question of temperament than talent,     whereby error lies in the misconstrued principles upon which the original project was founded.  Though     chance music and improvisation is a path toward the creation of music-- and a damned fine one at that--     it can't guarantee good music anymore than meditative contemplation by a classical composer can lead to     Beethoven's <i>9th Symphony</i>.  Furthermore, to truly subscribe to the philosophy and use of field-recording     as a work of art involves the commercial denial of the product insofar as nearly anyone can find an empty     space where they can sit and simply listen to the environment around them, free of charge.  Optimistically,     this excursion merely represents a flirtation with imbalanced recording for a band, something the group had     to flush out of their system prior to their next masterpiece, and not an enduring trend towards irrelevancy.</p></div>"|11823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11823-telegraphs-in-negative-mouths-trapped-in-static/|5.3|Andrew Bryant

At last, the sounds of <i>Clear Blue Skies</i> can again grace the ears of the common man, an album only
    A-Rod or B-Gates could have picked up recently.  The availability of the Juggaknots' one vinyl-only full-length had been relegated to the Net over the past few years, fetching upwards
    of sixty dollars each time it was posted on eBay.  Rumors of another pressing floated for some time-- in large part because the only other Fondle 'Em LP of the era (Kool Keith and Godfather Dox92s <i>The
    Cenobites</i>) got another go-'round in 2000-- but this year <i>Clear Blue Skies</i> is finally getting the King Ralph Royal Meal Deal expanded treatment, available for the first time on either CD or
    double vinyl, with eleven bonus tracks, in a store near you.</p><p>
    Up until this point, Breezly Brewin and Buddy Slim havex92t exactly been household names, but the Bronx duo has risen to cult status through some exceptional guest appearances.
    Many may remember the Brewix92s contribution to \x93Fire in Which You Burx94, on Company Flow's <i>Funcrusher Plus</i>.  If you have a reasonable excuse for missing his opening verse
    (though, you dox92t), perhaps he's more recognizable as the lead role of Tariq in Prince Paul's cinemaudio opus <i>A Prince Among Thieves</i>.  With an added third member (Queen
    Heroine), the Juggaknots also helped fill in the RZA-esque bleeps and Pterodactyl-screams of Mr. Lex92s \x93This Morning\x94, the standout track on the Matador-released <i>Pity the Fool</i>.  If all of this
    slipped under your late 90s rap-o-meter, hopefully last year's terrific comeback 12\x94 \x93WKRP in NYC\x94 jogs your memory.</p><p>
    I'd high-five you if these releases were all a part of your music library, but in case they arex92t, consider <i>Re: Release</i> your salvation.  All nine tracks from the original album are collected here,
    albeit in incorrect order.  Call it nitpicking, but the sequencing of this LP is essential: from \x93The Hunt is Ox94 to \x93I'm Gonna Kill You\x94, each song pounded into the next, creating a thick swamp of
    street wisdom and relentless battle raps.  Breaking up the flow with bonus tracks (read: session outtakes) that rarely last two full minutes was a mistake.  Still, the masterwork remains.</p><p>
    \x93Trouble Max94 is the proper <i>Clear Blue Skies</i> kickoff, with a distantly fading piano and a bassline that seemingly jumps the gun before the start of each measure.  Buddy Slim, vocally
    reminiscent of Parrish Smith, clobbers the track.  Complete with sampled explosions (dox92t front) Slim gets to work: \x93You become a sittix92 duck, but fuck it I aix92t givix92 in/ I'm livix92 trifle, the
    pen and pad becomes a 12-gauge rifle.\x94  This is pure, unadulterated, urban angst, twisted through the mind of a grizzled war veteran.</p><p>
    Easily the album's highlight, the title track is curiously found as an unlisted bonus cut.  This song should not go unnoticed, and the following statement is not made lightly:
    \x93Clear Blue Skies\x94 is one of the greatest hip-hop songs of the past decade.  Breezly Brewin, through some knob tweaking, portrays both a white father and his son, quarreling over the sox92s
    interracial relationship.  Superbly articulate and critical, the Brewin tastefully deals with race in a domestic context that is rarely explored so patiently in hip-hop.  This song alone is justification
    for any eBay price inflation.</p><p>
    Aside from the aforementioned sequencing problems, it's impossible to complain for the simplest of reasons: this superb, out of print record is back, and widely available.  The bonus tracks
    are a nice touch in and of themselves, and have some worth considering the limited output of anything wholly Juggaknots, period.  The group shouldx92t have to worry about wallowing in
    obscurity anymore, as a new batch of fans can discover a Fondle 'Em gem without breaking the bank.  Sit back, program tracks 1, 2, 3, 11, 5, 9, 7, 20, and 16 into your player, and revel in the
    <i>Clear Blue Skies</i>.</p></div>"|4310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4310-rerelease-clear-blue-skies/|8.2|Matt Kallman

    How many party dresses need to take a beer bath before the Yeah Yeah Yeahs drop the rock icon pastiche
    and just play some music?  Over and over again, they've been accused of empty posturing, wallowing in
    scrofulous, self-conscious ""irony,"" disguising themselves <i>Predator</i>-style as the public conception
    of who they were supposed to be rather than who they actually are.  And yet (dramatic pause), until the
    stylists and spin-mongers start writing the music, why does this still have to matter?  The band plays the
    blistering, bassless hand they're dealt, plus or minus the cards up their designer sleeves, and make the
    ""right moves.""  More power to them; hype, famously, is a bitch, a shrew, and in the end, it's still theirs
    to try and tame.  No one wants to be the ill-fated morning-after tat on the ass-end of the garage-rock
    revival, after all.</p><p>
    The really stupid part of all this, though, is that the shitstorm of publicity that's been hanging overhead
    the Yeah Yeah Yeahs is based on all of, what, eight songs?  Two EP/singles?  Robert Pollard throws away eight
    songs before breakfast and you sure as hell don't see him on the cover of <i>NME</i>.  Well, hold yr breath,
    kids.  The YYY's have finally released the plot element that their garage-to-riches <i>Cinderella II</i>
    story has most sorely lacked: The Full-Length Album.  This is gonna make 'em rockstars, everybody!  The
    final story arc-- and how's this for irony-- will conclude with them shedding their personas here, showing
    everyone that they've got what it takes to endure, and living happily ever after as the saviors of rock 'n'
    rollllll...</p><p>
    Except, they don't do any of that.  Or maybe (and this is only an hypothesis) they were never all that
    guilty of the heinous crimes of Fashion they've been charged with in the first place?  Either way, here it
    is, <i>Fever to Tell</i>, and they just play the same guitar/drums rock they have since the beginning--
    what'd you expect?  Sure, you can practically feel Karen O looking over her shoulder for approval with
    every faux-erotic squeal or disdainful shout, and a number of these tracks fall flat entirely because of
    the knowing, brutal swagger they try so damn hard to affect.  And when it's all over, the slow-burning,
    gently chaotic dissolve of ""No No No"" (even the title is self-conscious) or the bluesy strut of ""Black
    Tongue"" will wither under anything more than passing scrutiny, but more will remain.</p><p>
    Reason is, first and foremost, the near-faultless musical support at the core of the YYY's: Nick Zinner and
    Brian Chase.  If you can hear (or even care to try to hear, which you shouldn't) an ounce of ""posture"" in
    Zinner's thunderous guitar licks or Chase's relentless percussive assault, then you're a more cynical man
    (or woman) than I.  The rhythms are never very complicated, but when it counts, Chase pounds away with
    enough precise desperation to project an unfailing sense of urgency; it carries through even the more
    emotional tracks, lending the rare vulnerability a tragic sort of transience.</p><p>
    Between the vicious buzz and slender trill of Zinner's strings is a breathtaking range-- the robotically
    looped harmonics of ""Rich"" coupled with the layered crunch of the wall-of-sound that collapses on top of
    them; the stop/start emergency-room shriek of ""Date With a Night"".  Even Karen O seems stunned by the
    anthemic scope of the blazing, surf-like guitar and Chase's deafening percussion on ""Y Control""; she turns
    in one of her most subdued vocals, as if it's all she can do just to keep up.  Not coincidentally, it's
    also one of her most impressive turns.</p><p>
    That's not O's only compelling performance, though-- there are a couple moments when she drops her lacquered
    sneers and teases, and when this happens, it suddenly becomes very difficult to avoid seeing the music in a
    different light.  Of course, her success varies.  At times, she's the linchpin of the band-- and not just
    because her gratuitous sexual tension has become their trademark-- while at others she's the weakest link.
    The problem here is that, while the guys are definitely on here, they're still nowhere near groundbreaking,
    and as a result, they rise and fall depending largely on Karen's delivery.  Her play-acting is what got the
    Yeah Yeah Yeahs slapped with the charges of shallow insincerity in the first place.  It shouldn't matter if
    it's a façade, but it does; knowing beforehand what you're dealing with or not, it becomes very trying to
    accept every sleazy squeak as part of her routine.  If the band ever wants to really dump these lingering
    doubts for good, they'll need to overcome this obstacle.</p><p>
    Still, for proof that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, at their core, make a better band than they do runway
    trendsetters, one need look no further than <i>Fever to Tell</i>'s singular true moment of clarity-- a
    tune of such moving grace I can scarcely believe they're responsible for it-- ""Maps"".  Though the song is
    sadly in a class by itself on this record (it would take about two seconds to call roll for the tunes that
    even come close), absolutely everything falls into place here.  The drums are gentle enough to simply caress
    the tune, but still pressing enough to make it clear that this second of happiness is fleeting, and Zinner's
    guitar work is easily his best to date, equal parts joy and discord.  But it's Karen's vocals that steal
    the show; for once, they fairly drip genuine, regretful emotion: When she sings, ""Lay off/ Don't stray/
    My kind is your kind/ I'll stay the same.../ They don't love you like I love you,"" almost on the verge of
    defeated tears, the emotive response it produces is very real, and that means a lot.</p></div>"|8888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8888-fever-to-tell/|7.4|Eric Carr

Let's toast; Smart Drinks are on me. Coming off like The
    Cure's own transition into the last decade, <i>Mixed Up</i>, tracks from The Faint's wildly popular 2001
    record <i>Danse Macabre</i> get molded here into to the throbbing glowstick beats and gigantic bronze
    cojones of famous producers such as Junior Sanchez, Photek, and Paul ""Assembly Line"" Oakenfold.</p><p>
    For the most part, each remix is based around the most identifiable facet of The Faint: the whiny,
    underdog-Simon-LeBon mewl of vocalist Todd Baechle. Conveniently, he's also the band's most annoying facet.
    (Oh, he's funny, and has the propensity to get naked at shows quicker than the strippers at the Blue Banana.
    I'm sure there's a lotta fuckin' urban disaffect gripping Omaha like a disease, but dudes! Blase 80s vox
    are the new emo howl: &amp; I have grown weary of them.) However, even if your selective listening skills allow
    you to drown out Baechle's pukey purse-lipped coif, the actual remixes here-- with a few exceptions-- are
    mired in trahnce cliché, premeditated keyboard blasts, canny beats, and that ""UH UH UH"" pulsing low-end
    synth whir that blankets practically every cheap 90s house comp sold in the cut-out bin of yr local Fred
    Meyer's. It's all very inoffensive in its lightly perspiring drive, like hearing ""Pure Energy"" by the
    Information Society, ten times.</p><p>
    Okay, maybe only eight times. Two tracks stand out: The Calculator's minimal version of ""Posed to Death""
    neutralizes Baechle's authoritative pronunciations (wait... is this guy even British?!) with Leila Cusack's
    pretty vocals, all over a balloony glitch track that sounds straight from the new Prefuse 73 record. And
    with maybe a tiny sense of irony, Ursula 1000 turns ""Your Retro Career Melted"" into a funky, bass-driven
    disco track infused with cowbell and handclaps.</p><p>
    Otherwise, each remix bleeds into the next with not-really-alarming anonymity. ""The Conductor"" is tackled by
    Madonna cohort Jacques Le Conti, aka the guy who remixed that critical Jack White blowjob, Electric Six's
    ""Danger! High Voltage!"" Paul Oakenfold does his intense, positive ""enter the matrix"" trance thing, and Tommie
    Sunshine mirrors that feel on ""Let the Poison Spill from Your Throat"", albeit with better beats and more
    subtleties.  Photek gives ""Total Job"" an industrial makeover (complete with a chorus sung by an Apprentice
    of Satan) worthy of NIN's <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>, before blending into Jagz Kooner's farting version of
    ""Agenda Suicide"".  Mojolators, Junior Sanchez, even Medicine's operatic glitch... I think I got roofed and
    woke up in a desert rave.</p><p>
    Is this record The Faint's attempt for legitimacy in the dance world? Is it an attempt to crossover into a
    larger audience, i.e. the vast amount of people who inexplicably relate to and purchase Oakenfold records?
    Is it an attempt by Astralwerks to regain that portion of the indie rock audience they lost after what seemed
    like a straight year of nothing but <i>Bare Essentials</i> comps?  All that's cool w/me, but <i>Dance Macabre
    Remixes</i> doesn't even have the energy to scream ""JACK YO BODY"" like virtually every 90s house comp ever.
    Instead, its overarching mediocrity sends the message: ""This is preordained, socially acceptable dance music
    (possibly tailored for people who don't normally dance)."" And everyone knows that ""preordained"" and ""socially
    acceptable"" are the carpool lanes on the freeway to B O R I N G.</p></div>"|2949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2949-danse-macabre-remixes/|3.2|Julianne Shepherd

    spaced sounds and vintage flange, his songs never seem like mere excuses for blasting off into the cosmic abyss; in fact, I'd go so far as to say that when 
    he's singing, his music is generally straight ahead British folk, along the lines of old Sandy Denny or possibly Comus' lighter moments.  Furthermore-- 
    unlike virtually everyone outside of Jeff Mangum-- he's able to keep his far-outness from overwhelming the tunes.  In a world where Makoto Kawabata 
    threatens to release a new record every month, that means a lot.</p><p>
<i>Airs of the Ear</i> is Youngs' fourth record on Jagjaguwar, and is often reminiscent of his 1998 high point, <i>House Music</i>, on which troubadour 
    melodies and eccentric takes on psychedelia and musique concrete were exposed as better bedfellows than you might think.  The songs are generally 
    long, but rarely seem like workouts; when Youngs rides a phrase, he tends to opt for trance-like repetition instead of aimless noodling or extended 
    forays into sound-effect hell (hey, it worked for Ash Ra).  There are moments when retro sci-fi terror via who-knows-what arrays of ring-modulated 
    synth might lure you off track, but it's nothing a healthy flashback couldx92t render merely charming.  As a whole, this is a pretty earthbound 
    record for being so superficially spacey.</p><p>
    \x93Fire Horse Rising\x94 gathers a head of steam in five relatively short minutes.  Typically, it begins with a delicate, fingerpicked guitar line 
    accompanied by various homemade effects (provided by, among other things, some kind of hyped-up theremin).  Youngs' minimal lyrics, similar to past 
    efforts, serve not so much to narrate a story as to help along the reedy melody (though \x93I dox92t understand, I dox92t want to know\x94 is right in line with his relation to current trends in 
    music).  Soon enough, the fuzz bass comes in, guitars are dubbed and overdubbed, and various screaming electro-tones 
    wail in the distance.  The effect is similar to Angels of Light's symphonic folk steamroller, though where that band might barrel down on the song, 
    Youngs is content to drift, though with considerable momentum.  That he's able to muster this kind of power as a one-man show is all the more 
    impressive.</p><p>
    \x93Halifax Amore\x94 reminds me of last year's <i>May</i>, though the discordant square-wave interjections do their best to punt this as far away from that 
    record's entirely acoustic atmosphere as possible.  However, like <i>May</i>'s music, \x93Halifax Amore\x94 takes two lines of verse and understated guitar 
    to deliver a barely-there hybrid of folk and minimalism.  Youngs' vocal harmonies add a mournful tinge to the song, but where trance ceases to 
    emphasize pulse, there's always a chance you might miss a few bars if you're not totally zoned in on what's happening.  \x93Machaut's Dream\x94 uses similar 
    tactics, though the good old theremin supplies some much needed soft counterpoint to the thin melody.  Youngs' guitar playing, as always, 
    provides a skeletal framework for the rest of his tiny motifs to work in and around, but again, if you arex92t up to the task/joy of an epic stroll down 
    minstrel lane, the details might get lost in the shuffle.</p><p>
    The maddening thing about <i>Airs of the Ear</i> is that no matter how many times I think I've lost track of the previous 20 minutes or so, all the melodies 
    stay with me.  Singing along to this stuff is almost second nature, which I guess means Youngs' songs really are able to survive the half dozen effects 
    applied to each verse.  Far be it from me to condemn anyone for running with a groove, especially when way-out-there sounds are involved-- if you're on 
    the same wavelength, there's plenty to hear inside the mix, and hum along while you do.</p></div>"|8841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8841-airs-of-the-ear/|7.4|Dominique Leone

    launching into some kind of perverse, indie rock version of <i>The $10,000 Pyramid</i>, twitching in a
    plastic seat and frantically hollering buzzwords: Superchunk frontman! Co-owner of Merge Records!
    Tropicalia!  Chapel Hill!  Canadian film soundtrack!  Yo La Tengo!  But the peripheral associations
    that inevitably infuse any discussion of a Portastatic record (this being Portastatic's fifth
    full-length, and first in six years) are often the least interesting parts.</p><p>
    The brainchild of multi-tasking Mac McCaughan, Portastatic is pretty much a one-man show, but McCaughan
    has invited a host of equally talented co-conspirators to pitch in: Janet Weiss (Sleater-Kinney, Quasi),
    Tony Crow (Lambchop), and Margaret White (Sparklehorse, North Elementary) all contribute their respective
    bits to the record's clever, synth-punched pop/rock.  <i>The Summer of the Shark</i> flirts with acoustic
    nuance (""Oh Come Down""), fuzzy guitar assaults (""Windy Village""), and rhythmic electric grooves (""Through
    a Rainy Lens""); McCaughan hops styles relentlessly, but rather than feeling chaotic or disorganized, <i>The
    Summer of the Shark</i> has the internal coherence of an expertly assembled mixtape.  The narrative and
    stylistic lines running from song to song might not be instantly visible, but they're certainly present.</p><p>
    That McCaughan wrote most of these songs on guitar is obvious, and <i>The Summer of the Shark</i> is a
    noticeable departure from 1997's less six-stringed <i>The Nature of Sap</i>.  The album was recorded on
    \xBD-inch eight-track tape at McCaughan's home studio (his brother Matthew plays drums on half the tracks),
    but it's hardly lo-fi scrambling.  Though it may not quite reach the peaks of 1997's <i>The Nature of
    Sap</i>, its polish and expert production make it Portastatic's most diverse and accomplished work to
    date.</p><p>
    The excellent ""Swimming Through Tires"" opens with spare piano chords and an echoing assortment of clanks,
    clatters, and high-pitched bings, like a sack of forks upended over a snare drum; when McCaughan's doubled
    and harmonized voice finally pipes up, it's heavy with studied desperation, promising, ""I will be with you
    when I am able."" Soon, trombone and bowed bass slither in and curl up at the foot of the bed: the result is
    both comforting and oddly resigned.  ""Oh Come Down"", which Mac breathily coos with Janet Weiss, is a perfectly formed pop cupcake, full of
    resonant acoustic guitar picking and popping drums, a vigorous, gluey bassline filling in holes as necessary.
    When Mac goes electric nearly four minutes in, the subsequent solo is a welcome (if anachronistic) freakout,
    his curious guitar syntax all the more appealing for the contrast and tension it provides.  Album closer
    ""Hey Salty"" lets McCaughan show off his quirky, nasal falsetto and penchant for loud/quiet/loud structure;
    it also sees McCaughan heartily insisting, perhaps against instinct, that ""it's okay.""</p><p>
    There are definite themes embedded here.  While he's not exactly coming on up to <i>The Rising</i>, McCaughan
    does (explicitly) address the events of September 11th on <i>The Summer of the Shark</i>: ""I do not need
    another gap in my life/ When there's teeth missing in the sky downtown,"" he laments in ""Chesapeake"", before
    admitting, in ""In the Lines"", ""Now everyone hangs flags out their window/ I've got a white towel."" Superchunk
    was scheduled to perform-- as part of a Merge showcase for CMJ-- in downtown Manhattan on September 14th and,
    in the days directly following the attack, McCaughan nobly chose to tackle the 700-mile drive from North
    Carolina to New York City (passing a cracked, still-smoking Pentagon) to perform his scheduled solo set
    alongside The Clean, Ladybug Transistor, former Bricks bandmate Laura Cantrell, and some stranded Saddle
    Creekers.</p><p>
    Released nearly eighteen months later, <i>The Summer of the Shark</i> is, at least lyrically, still heavy
    with the kind of misdirected melancholy that marked the immediate wake of the attacks.  Even the record's
    title is seeped in subtext: in August 2001, <i>Time Magazine</i> ran a (characteristically) hyperbolic
    cover story, complete with pithy, newsstand-worthy headline: <i>Summer of the Shark</i>. Weeks earlier, an
    eight-year old boy had been brutally mauled by a bull shark while swimming off the coast of Pensacola,
    Florida-- the incident, unprovoked and tragic, kicked off an avalanche of sensationalistic journalism, as
    reporters donned wetsuits and began lurid, stupid investigations of man-eating fish.  As a catchphrase,
    ""Summer of the Shark"" quickly went ubiquitous.</p><p>
    Less than a month later, empty proclamations like ""Summer of the Shark"" functioned symbolically, indicative
    of a now-obsolete era in which a bored press had the liberty of transforming random, isolated incidents into
    certifiable trends.  After the unprecedented events of September 11th, worry over aggressive sea creatures
    seemed frivolous, at best, and killer sharks slipped back into screenplays and Panama City nightmares.
    Journalists scurried back into blue blazers.  It's an appropriate title for a record so rich in contrast.
    McCaughan layers distressed, despondent lyrics over addictive melodies without pause-- capturing both some
    of our innocence and some of our loss.</p></div>"|6415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6415-the-summer-of-the-shark/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

    that its yawning, eye-gooey sounds were faithfully cobbled together into a
    patchwork blanket of bedtime in some opium den, rural deep-walnut bedroom, or
    other plushly closed-up space with those little glow-in-the-dark stars on the
    ceiling. Often, the bands who sing these self-conscious lullabies are best
    understood while you, the listener, are also saddled-down all cozy and
    half-awake, maybe with pillows over your head or your windows painted a
    solid, endless black (this way you can invent an ideal landscape of longing
    for your perfectly uninspired town).  This is psych-pop, and as with all
    psychotropics, once you have experimented you can never go back.</p><p>
    
    Eschewing a third-person adjectival name for his sleep-deprived pop-psych,
    Greg Weeks, who looks to me like a gaunter, fresh-faced Vincent Gallo and
    actually sounds a bit like that spanner of time, plays a predictable but
    also enjoyable brand of gentle insomniac rock. Weeks' five-song EP, <i>Slightly
    West</i> (perhaps titled in reference to a half-assed manifest destiny)
    often plays like it came to Weeks during a 20-minute break in an otherwise
    deeply restive stretch of time. In a lot of ways (some good and some bad)
    it barely registers on his homemade sleep-monitoring machine.</p><p>
    
    The opening ""One Summer Night"" has welcoming organs like that old church
    song called ""Hallelujah""; for some reason it made me think of Kenny Rogers'
    ""We've Got Tonight"". Maybe it's the boy/girl vocals?  Or the sense, impending,
    that this is the last day these two have together?  Shit, even <i>more</i>
    confusing to the participants, it might be the first of many: ""One summer
    night/ By firelight/ We laid out under the stars/ And set our sights."" To
    be picky, I'd like it better if they set their sighs.</p><p>
    
    The next four songs are standard in a lot of ways, but the addition of crunchy
    and distorted analog-sounding keyboard, organ, and/or synth parts make what
    could've been paint-by-numbers-boring sort of firefly languid.  ""Unsettled
    (By the Sun)"" is more psych, less pop, and talks of nightmares and dreams
    (""Who wants inside a dream?"").  The vocals are submerged in the shade of drums,
    organ, bass, and little jangling bells.  The title track (incidentally, also
    the album's strongest) is comforting like the smell of a skunk on a dark road
    in some town you're just barely visiting. It speaks of false comforts-- ""It's
    safe by the sea/ The ocean/ But crawling up behind""-- but comfort nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    By song four, ""Devils"", I was hemming and hawing about Weeks' voice being a
    bit nondescript.  Here, too, the organ parts are patchy and overly ""sinister.""
    The song is obviously stitched and fails to flow quite as nicely as the first
    three: a fucked-up Frankenstein monster all awkward and unworkable. On ""Settle
    Down"" there are moments where I peel my ears to hear Magic Hour guitar parts,
    but it's never as dense or sustained (though I do think I heard a gong!).</p><p>
    
    Sustain. The weakness of this offering at the alter of pixie dust is that
    the shit never busts out. There are those pretty moments on the first three
    tracks, but it largely feels truncated, like when a band has two seconds of
    feedback at the end of a song and then fades to the next (are we supposed to
    imagine endlessness?).</p><p>
    
    But at the same time that I talk of making things last longer, more densely,
    it's actually the brevity of the recording that works in Weeks' favor, since
    the songwriting and singing aren't particularly striking. The mood evoked is
    pleasant enough-- and there's nothing overtly ridiculous or aesthetically
    embarrassing-- but at the same time, getting by on one connotation can only
    last so long.  I think of the laughable melancholy of Codeine, whereas the
    more inspired shut-eye of, say, early Spacemen 3 could seemingly go on until
    forever, keeping you wrapped in dreamscapes until kingdom come, amen...</p><p>
    
    But knowing one's strengths and/or limitations is nothing to push aside. On
    his website, Weeks mentions the importance of the EP to his oeuvre, how
    sometimes what needs to be said requires a short story, not a novel. I guess
    I just like it when there's fucked-up poetry, too. I mean, even when you're
    recording in a metaphorical bedroom, it helps to climb out the window or
    sneak through a hole in the wall and dream your nightmare on the roof,
    expand outward to the blank spaces around you.</p></div>"|8602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8602-slightly-west-ep/|6.8|Brandon Stosuy

Yeah,
    that's about what I expected, 'cause you know, I haven't pulled it out much lately myself.  That kind of
    bothers me.  <i>YHF</i> did, after all, cling battered and bruised to the top spot on my list for the
    Palindromic Year, and one would expect it would have a better shelf-life, even though it's been
    wink-wink-available for nigh on two years.</p><p>
    
    Now, before you start sharpening your Outlook, know that this is not an official Pitchfork backlash war
    cry, but a mere personal assessment.  I was, you should know, the staff's staunchest defender of <i>YHF</i>'s
    canonization, enduring countless hipster rants about its dad-rock/easy-listening nature and the impressionability
    of the nation's boomer crits.  For a period of about nine months, anyone so unlucky as to be around me after
    three or four beers got to hear my pulpit speech about the horizon-widening effect that Jeff Tweedy &amp; Co.'s
    masterwork could have on the general populace.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's because of this intense love affair that I don't reach for <i>YHF</i> so much anymore, in favor of
    albums that slipped through my fingers while I proselytized about the genius last two minutes of ""Reservations"".
    Surely, then, this miniature collectible e-EP-- originally released as a deal-sweetener for <i>YHF</i>-buyers
    down under, and now streaming and/or downloadable (if you're an honorable sort) from the Wilco website--
    would rekindle some of the romance?  Packaging two of the better <i>YHF</i> outtakes with four more recent
    songs, <i>More Like the Moon</i> is timed like a snack to tide us over while the band gallivants around the
    U.S. with Sonic Youth and R.E.M. instead of RECORDING A NEW ALBUM DAMMIT WHY WON'T YOU FINISH ITTTTTT!</p><p>
    
    But for those of us pulling for Tweedy to keep the laptop plugged in, <i>More Like the Moon</i> will stream
    a bit hollow due to its focus on that old humdrum, outdated tool, the guitar.  Two tracks-- the unfamiliar
    ""Woodgrain"" and solo-show mainstay ""Bob Dylan's 49th Beard""-- are little more than street-corner-strumming
    Tweedy, ""Kamera"" resurfaces in grungier form as ""Camera"", and the title track and ""Handshake Drugs"" feature
    extended soloing twixt the verses.</p><p>
    
    Your enjoyment of those last two tracks will probably determine your final score, as they stretch out over
    more than half of the EP's twenty minutes and change.  ""Handshake Drugs"" comes off the better of the pair,
    employing a reclined groove and muffled ""Only a Northern Song"" noise breaks.  ""More Like the Moon"", on
    the other hand, is an extremely straightforward purty ballad, with extended near-Flamenco picking lending
    the track a Chi-Chi's-style ambience.  Yeah, it's somewhat moving and hardly faultable, but the bar is
    set too high now for Wilco to coast like they do here, restricting drummer Glenn Kotche to a first-day-of-drum-school
    beat and key-man Leroy Bach to gentle organ fills.</p><p>
    
    The only other misfire of the six tracks is ""Camera"", a bassy, fuzzed-out version that tramples over the
    delightfully subtle progression from folk-rock to laser guns in the original.  But an arena-size ""A Magazine
    Called Sunset"" comes out better than expected, given the several lackluster Springsteen-esque demo versions
    floating about-- even if it sounds more like a <i>Summerteeth</i> outtake than a <i>Yankee</i> cut (count 1,
    2, 3 keyboards in the first thirty seconds and know that Jay Bennett is in the hizzouse).  The two folky
    tracks squeak by on lyrical grins, with Tweedy going meta on ""Woodgrain"" (break out your touchdown bandaids
    for the self-ref ""Sometimes I rhyme/ Sometimes I don't"") and making a defense mechanism out of Dylan's facial
    hair on ""Beard"".</p><p>
    
    If you find the whole effort a tad bit underwhelming, there may be good reasons why; to connect the dots
    with the stopgap from the other 10.0 hate-mail-inducer of last year, Trail of Dead's <i>The Secret of Elena's
    Tomb</i> EP seems like a dressing room for the band to try on possible future directions, while <i>More Like
    the Moon</i> sounds like Wilco cleaning out their fridge, even though it's only 33% leftovers.  It's not that
    the sextet of material here plants any seeds of doubt about the band's future trajectory-- road-tested tracks
    like ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"" indicate there's plenty o' future to be excited about-- it's just that this release
    is less a tease for what lies ahead than an audit of last year's receipts.</p><p>
    
    But you can easily forgive <i>More Like the Moon</i> for being a bit of a dry-hump, due to its free and easy
    distribution on Wilco's website.  This gracious move is a reminder of what might have been the <em>real</em>
    epi-musical ""Meaning of <i>YHF</i>"": the digital-utopia-hinting fact that it was streamed on the band's own
    site and easy to find on file-sharing bazaars, yet still became Wilco's biggest unit-shifter by a mile, very
    likely due to (really, could it have been?!?) its Internet leakage.</p><p>
    
    All the same, my drunken <i>YHF</i> ramblings stay retired, replaced by an even more ludicrous sermon about
    how The Rapture are going to reinvent indie music based around the mere two songs I've heard from their
    upcoming full-length.  Don't get me wrong, I still stand convinced that <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> opened
    up a lot of aunts' and uncles' ears to new sounds, and assuming Loose Fur didn't shut all of them back up,
    it's a spell that's still working.  Still, <i>More Like the Moon</i> is far too safe a play to keep that
    momentum rolling between full-lengths, and fails to rise above the fan-club gift bonus it is.</p></div>"|8678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8678-more-like-the-moon-ep/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

<i>[All are seated.]</i></p><p>
    
    Elder Clapton: Our first order of business is to congratulate our most recent inductee for his brilliant
    effort of forwarding the blues tradition by idiomatic and new means. A round of applause for Brother White,
    whose invention, ""the biscuit,"" has pushed forward exciting new sexual innuendos. Gentlemen, there hasn't
    been anything this newsworthy since the emergence of ""the jellyroll"" [snorts].</p><p>
<i>[Round of applause and laughter goes up. Someone shouts: ""Yeah. Play the Blues!""]</i></p><p>
    
    Elder Richards: Now to the order of unfortunate business regarding the recent sacrilege of our Savior by two
    recent initiates, Brothers YZ and J.R.R. Token, who, outside of these walls, go by the name of The Immortal
    Lee County Killers. We have a few questions we'd like to pose to the two of you.</p><p>
    
    Brother Shepherd: First off, what's with this ""Robert Johnson"" song that begins your latest album? It
    appears to be just a smattering of our Messiah's lines held together by detuned, light-gauge strings and
    some barely sussed-out slide on top. I don't hear any twelve-bar blues here.</p><p>
    
    Brother YZ: We're from the South, so even though we're just playing sloppy punk with a slide, we get to call
    it ""the blues."" By mewling out loud like I got a kidney stone and I'm fixin' to die, I am channeling the
    spirit of Johnson. I've even read Steven LaVere's transcriptions of Robert Johnson's songs, so I know what
    he says.</p><p>
    
    Brother Thorogood: But shit, Brother YZ, you sound like Brother Spencer with that Crawlin' King Snake crammed
    down your craw on ""Shitcanned Again"" and almost every other dang thing here, be it an Otis Redding cover or
    an old gospel tune. That ain't exactly becoming.</p><p>
    
    Brother Token: Yeah, well, I got more blues in what I coughed up this morning than the last fifty years of
    you fucks combined. When's the last time any of you could do something as sonically destitute as the void of
    ""Weak Brain, Narrow Mind"" and make it sound as evil as the living dead clawing their way out of the Mississippi
    mud? It might as well be Willie Dixon's skeleton rattling the hemorrhoids of yer lily-white back doors.</p><p>
    
    Brother Cooder: Well, since they wouldn't know Esu from Ruben Studdard, they sure can't boogie on R.L.
    Burnside's ""Goin' Down South"", slathering it instead with some red-eye gravy of punk clatter.</p><p>
    
    Brother Cray: And when they turn up, they're about as tasty as Kentucky Fried Goat. You gotta let that goat
    cook up real slow, boys. But even though your plumb-dumb ineptitude and suburban caterwauling should mussy
    up the slower, faux-rhetorical titles like ""Truth Through Sound"", it's surprisingly non-odious and the best
    thing you do.</p><p>
    
    Grand Wizard Richards: Agreed. You sure ain't the Gibson Brothers. You boys are much better at crawling than
    at galloping. Sullyin' up your own pot of beans is one thing, but to be plain messin' with the blues just
    won't cut it in these affluent circles.</p></div>"|4080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4080-love-is-a-charm-of-powerful-trouble/|3.9|Andy Beta

When I finally bought everything I could find     under all three names, I began to see the music of Jan St. Werner as existing     along a spectrum, with the tuneful music he made with Andi Toma as Mouse on     Mars at one end, the free-floating manipulations of his Markus Popp collaboration     Microstoria on the other, and his own work as Lithops in the middle.  And     that's how it went for St. Werner's output generally, but one album was fixed     at the fulcrum between St. Werner's abstract and pop interests: Mouse on Mars'     <em>Glam.</em></p><p><em>Glam</em>'s initial release was a vinyl-only limited edition, but now it's     finally been reissued domestically on CD (there was a pricey Japanese import     CD with the bonus tracks also included here). I listened to <em>Glam</em> constantly in '99 but hadn't put it on for a while now, so I was curious     whether it was as great as I remembered. It is, for the most part. And it's     particularly fun to hear now because it captures Mouse on Mars at such an     interesting time. Though they've since distinguished themselves as a warped     electronic pop group, Mouse on Mars were all over the place during the latter     half of the 90s, working with everybody and experimenting like crazy. Atmospheric     soundscaping was something they excelled at when so inclined, as evidenced     by the abstract tracks they placed on compilations (most of which were collected     on the equally fine <em>Instrumentals</em> album), and that's where their focus is     through most of <em>Glam</em>.</p><p>As a collection of pieces initially constructed as sound cues, <em>Glam</em> sometimes feels like an album packed with brilliant but unfinished ideas.     Three great albums could be made if the music hinted at here were extended     and developed. For example, it would please me if the feedback drones     refracted through a fine mist of distortion on ""High Court Low Cut"" lasted     for fifteen minutes instead of just over three, and I think it's safe to say     that if an instrumental on the My Bloody Valentine album that never was     sounded this pretty it would have been worth the wait. The snarling, crunchy     breaks of ""Tiplet Metal Plate"" hint at a dark and funky industrial road not     taken, with far more groove than the cartoony noise tracks Mouse on Mars     would later construct. And a good portion of the album's first half is fine     70s-sounding ambient, something Eno would have been proud to put his stamp     on during his prime.</p>
<p>A couple tracks did find their way to other projects. ""Mood Leck Backlash""     is similar enough to <em>Iaora Tahiti</em>'s ""Gocard"" to be considered an     alternate version, and the unbelievably joyous sunburst pop instrumental     ""Glim"", which closes this record, also finished out the <em>Cache Coure Naif</em> EP.  Despite the patchwork nature of <em>Glam</em>, though, where not-quite-finished     tracks in a number of different styles seem stitched together, it works as an     album. Maybe I spent too many hours staring at the sleeve art (a good argument     for keeping the vinyl), but the cover, a shot that might have been titled     ""Hyenas on the Savannah at Dusk"", really captures the mood of <em>Glam</em>.     It's a grainy video capture that diffuses the early evening light into     finely textured particles, and the photograph is gripped with tension as it     straddles boundaries between day and night, between the natural world and an     electronic representation. <em>Glam</em>, absorbing influences from the vast     musical world of all of Mouse on Mars, has a similar complexity.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, then there's the story of how the album came to be. By now anyone     remotely interested in Mouse on Mars knows that <em>Glam</em> was originally     recorded as a soundtrack for an awful Australian film called starring Tony     ""Who's the Boss?"" Danza but was rejected outright by the producers as being     too experimental. I haven't seen the film, but I think the producers probably     knew what they were doing. It's impossible to imagine Danza's face onscreen     as this music plays in the background. Still, I love the idea that Mouse on     Mars approached scoring a straight-to-video piece of shit as if they were     Popol Vuh working with Werner Herzog. Instead of tossing something off,     getting paid, and going home, they holed up in St. Martin in The Streets     and recorded some of their best music. <em>Glam</em> is the sound of two believers.</p>

    weary, sleep deprived, hope fading.  By now the CD wallet reserves are usually full of music for those
    precious few humidity-free days above sixty, but lately we've been forced to resort to the standbys of
    years past rather than fresh meat.  Originality is not necessarily a prerequisite; any virally contagious
    melody will do.</p><p>
    
    In trying times like these, it might be helpful to look to the scraps left behind by the dissolved Elephant
    6 franchise.  The Essex Green offer promise, one of the few E6 acts with throwbacks to the Yankee side of
    psychedelic pop and the easiest group to imagine playing in Golden Gate Park at the turn of the 60s.
    Combining that era's strange mix of backwoods-country idealism, quaint space-race experimentation, and
    electric guitar dervishes, these Vermonters put together 1999's <i>Everything Is Green</i>, one of the
    finest releases from the E6 minor leagues.</p><p>
    
    Now a subsidiary of the Merge corporation, The Essex Green's <i>The Long Goodbye</i> could be the album that
    moves the band out of the shadows of their former benefactors, a more mature effort and all that jazz/rock.
    It's a much more cohesive affair, a record less given towards ADD skips across the stylistic map, and like
    every band going through musical puberty, they've begun sprouting string arrangements like new body hair.
    Even the cocoa-rich voice of Sasha Bell, the band's most distinguishable feature, is given more precedence!</p><p>
    
    So why do I forget I'm listening to the album by the time it's finished?  Other than ""Our Lady in Havana"",
    a demurely epic Bell-sung <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> tale (did I mention these guys like the late 60s?)
    wrapped in swaddling strings, <i>The Long Goodbye</i> is largely ephemeral.  Stripped of their eccentricities
    (no Irish jigs, no dye-on-the-overhead-projector guitar jams), the band seems to have evolved along the same
    path many of their SF idols trod, evolving into an act content to churn out happy-afternoon folk-rock like
    ""Sorry River"" and ""Southern States"".</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, tentative dives into more New England twang efforts are rather disappointing for a group that
    created an entire side project (The Sixth Great Lake) in tribute to The Band.  ""Lazy May"" wrings out a nice
    opry from steel guitar tears, but conjures images of Russian kickdancers.  Allowing that heavily ethnic
    sound, the merry banjo of the largely instrumental ""Old Dominion"" might as well be the score to a <i>Sesame
    Street</i> segment on barnyard animals for all the woodsy gravitas it doesn't possess.</p><p>
    
    Mostly, The Essex Green just can't help sounding overly saturated by their influences, a fact that, while
    endearing on their debut-- where there also seemed to be more influences to draw from-- starts to show its
    limitations the second time around.  California dreamin' like ""Berlin"" and ""The Late Great Cassiopia"" (sic)
    are certainly easy on the eardrums, but like bingeing on a snack food, you'll be hungry again an hour later.
    Even in the midst of an indie-pop drought it's still possible to be choosy-- it's not time to settle for
    barely noticeable breezes like <i>The Long Goodbye</i> just yet.</p></div>"|2834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2834-the-long-goodbye/|6.2|Rob Mitchum

    quartet by changing the refrain of ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" to ""Playing Joy Division covers, beautiful and alone,""
    says: ""The circuit between Justin Timberlake and a fourteen year-old girl is what's really important about
    music, and... that connection is more profound than the one between an Interpol record and a fifty-year-old
    rock critic."" Whuh-oh! Holy Christgau! The Tweedist notes that if a scientist from the future came to visit
    us (why not a Terminator, Jeff?) that ""N*SYNC would tell him more about our culture than any Will Oldham
    record."" (Ahem, females have made remarkable advances in science-careering, there, Cap'n Foxtrot.) Then he
    half-disses Wilco! Have fourteen years of high-profile music-making got my boy all discombobulated? If he's
    truly under the spell of über-pop's nauseous gravity, something tells me he'd find the hullabaloo over his
    remastered, bonus-track-befattened early work with Joltin' Jay Farrar a tad unremarkable. And I'll admit:
    the worth of these discs to anyone not already a Tupelo tutee will depend on whether your response to
    monoliths is an infantilizing, golly-bum wonderment, or an urge to pull a Jello Biafra and tinkle on the
    shriney behemoths.</p><p>
    Let me set the scene for the cultural landscape when Uncle Tupelo busted out: The cassingle shelves were
    still reeling from the layered grooves of Neneh Cherry's ""Buffalo Stance"". People were fascinated with the
    psychological underpinnings of evil-twin absorption due to Stephen King's scouring of the subject in <i>The
    Dark Half</i>. Filmgoers finally learned what happened after Chris Lloyd's unforgettable Doc flew away in
    the garbage-fueled hovercar; and to tell the truth, we were underwhelmed by Cyborg Biff, Western Biff, and
    the absence of Crispin Glover as the fitful McFly patriarch. The scene was clearly set for a pair of Illinois
    malcontents to usurp and enhance a country sound that had already been fangled by folks from places as far
    away as California, some quite well (Rank &amp; File, Green on Red, etc).</p><p>
    The ""heartland"" was suffering as usual from Bookended Syndrome, penned (if one can be penned in vastness)
    between all manner of paisley undergrounds and post-punk revivals. And even the South had that whole
    ""Southern"" brand to promulgate. So these two prophets of the twang-blast complaint-jam, Tweedy and Farrar,
    successfully tractorjacked a style of delivery, reappropriating it for the midwest, further secularizing
    its good-versus-evil conceits (which already hinted at man-versus-machine struggles) by installing a new
    industrial devilry. <i>No Depression</i> is, of course, the album that spawned a webboard, a magazine, and
    a movement (if ""movement"" is an accurate word to describe a music largely about sitting around, watching
    trains go by, inhaling silo rust, drinking, and feeling grandiosely bummed). What's beautiful is that the
    expression isn't Unkie's but A.P. Carter's, from Toop's cover of his economic theodicy ""No Depression in
    Heaven""-- one of two Carter covers that beg for hill-cred on this hyperactive debut. (While we're being
    infinitely tangential, consult Mark Zwonitzer and Charles Hirshberg's excellent page-turner <i>Will You
    Miss Me When I'm Gone</i> for a history of the spastic and rambling A.P., the father of country who stole
    as many songs as he wrote.)</p><p>
    Reissues, though, demand to be examined in terms of how they ""hold up,"" and <i>No Depression</i>'s reputation
    seems vestigial, especially next to its follow-up, <i>Still Feel Gone</i>. Sure, ""Screen Door"" is a damn good
    skittle of misfitude, but elsewhere the boys sound like they haven't grown into their coveralls, and they
    were certainly yet to discover subtlety. Tweedy's faked southern accent can induce smirks, and Farrar's
    spoofable earnestness might have you bellowing about assembly lines into your Body Shop hempbrush. <i>No
    Depression</i> is innovative for about thirteen minutes, after which it's sorely redundant. The sophomore
    album is so much stronger-- it sounds like a fourth or fifth album-- that one wonders why the bash-n-crop
    genre these guys spawned isn't called ""feelgone."" In addition to how <i>Still Feel Gone</i>'s spectacular drums and (cliché
    alert-- but they earn it) ""blistering solos"" benefit the most from the digital refurbish, the band had
    settled into its song structures: the lyrics, though still awful slogany, are less strained (especially the
    part about ""walking cancerous miles""), the banjo backdrops are better timed, and the shifts from harmonica
    and acousti-pliddle into Hüsker Dü-dom are more organic. This album is a slightly wiser <i>No Depression</i>
    with plenty of power steering fluid.</p><p>
    Though definitely saddle-punk, <i>Still Feel Gone</i> is interestingly the least country Tupelo record, due
    to its trad-coverlessness, its Minutemen tribute ""D. Boon"", its heavy-handed production by the Fort Apache
    crew (who knobbed everyone into Boston-fodder a la Dino Jr and Buffalo Tom), its genius opener ""Gun"" (on
    which Tweedy synthesizes the entirety of The Replacements' <i>Tim</i>), and its genius closer ""If That's
    Alright"" (on which Tweedy lays the groundwork for what would become known as the grunge ballad). How did it
    become conventional wisdom that Farrar was the better songwriter? Much of his stuff is prosaic and
    melody-less; he may have better pipes than Jethco, but his homemade Stipe-Mellencamp-Linnell-Rollins
    smoothie can get hoary and grate.</p><p>
    Oh snap: The boys then hooked up with newly mandolin-competent producer Peter Buck, fresh from losing his
    religion and wearing vests over blouses, to record, in the actual South, their least characteristic but by
    far best album. (Sorry, <i>Anodyne</i> fans-- call me revisionist, but that out-n-back disc hardly sounds
    like a unified band. You can practically hear Tweedy sizing up new member Stirratt's mutiny-mettle. Even
    <i>Still Feel Gone</i> predicts a future schism, as any careful listener can detect seedlings of the
    irreconcilable differences between Farrar's insistence on gestures of meaningfulness and Tweedy's burgeoning
    nihilism.) Forty percent rearranged traditionals and covers, <i>March 16-20, 1992</i> strove for a porchiness
    that risked hokum, but thankfully, Buck rendered the project pristine; you'd think it were laid down in some
    soundproof gazebo outside an all-retiree church. The acoustic guitar has rarely sounded better than it does
    here.</p><p>
    This record's Geffen-be-damned songs against capitalism and Danzig-be-damned songs against Satan helped to
    make Tupelo the favorite uncle of many a bandwagon purist. The not-quite bluegrass of Tweedy's tearjerker
    ""Wait Up"" stands as one of the band's most inventive moments, and slowcore owes a debt to the almost-undrummable
    version of murderer's lament ""Lilli Schull"". (This review will now acknowledge the stickwork of Mike Heidorn.
    The man kept the fuggin beat.) Farrar tormentedly taps into some woodland ghost on his rendition of Dylan's
    rendition of the anonymous ""Moonshiner"" (since revisited by Cat Power, who rightfully added a verse about
    wanting to tour hell).  The songs about hard labor and unionbusting on <i>March</i> transcend the
    almost-quaint pre-NAFTA factory sentiments that underscore the first two albums. Tupelo's decidedly
    unescapist catalog reaches its apex in these oppression anthems, which, eleven years later, still haunt as
    mottoes of a perennially defeated army (and Wilco would, of course, go on to double-honor workingman's
    minstrel Woody Guthrie). Surely gazillionaire Buck was so enraptured by the blacklung alchemy underfoot
    that he could have never guessed that something called Wilco would tour with R.E.M., or that he'd play with
    the lauded troupe on a record called <i>Down With</i> them.</p><p>
    I'm the rare bitch who resents bonus tracks. They violate the sequencing of classic albums; imagine how a
    film's coherence would be disrupted if the ""deleted scenes"" played right after the denouement (consult the
    recent ripoff <i>Forever Changes</i>, though I won't complain about the mid-90s Ryko reissues of Bowie and
    Costello).  This triad boasts the usual, serviceable smattering of faster versions, slower versions, live
    versions, and rare covers.  Standouts include the unbelievably naptime-then-thunderous ""Sauget Wind"", among
    the band's top five songs, and proof that a fallen tree in the forest makes a bustass sound even if Albini
    didn't mic it. Two covers that should have been included on albums are ""I Wanna Destroy You"" (especially now
    that The Soft Boys are, um, soft) and Iggy's ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"".  These awesome homages would have broken
    up the austerity of Tupelo's humorless albums; one of my record-store coworkers once tossed <i>March</i>
    across the sales floor, proclaiming, ""I can't take their seriousness anymore, man: I'm trying to digest a
    hot dog, and I gotta live."" An aborted, hidden cover of the theme from <i>The Waltons</i> constitutes the
    ultimate pop-south surrender, though the show's atheist dad remains an inspiration.</p><p>
    Funny how Tweedy went on to be the John The Baptist of futro folk-rock, while Farrar's last project was a
    (vocal-less, natch) score for a film about the homoerotic subtext of football. Though this band spent two
    albums raving about beer and entropy, and could be skimpy on imagery, they rocked at a better ratio than
    they didn't. But is being the forebearers of a genre whose proponents average two good songs per album
    really something to be proud of? All we need now is for some statistician to ascertain why <i>No Depression</i>
    is loved by a disproportionate amount of people with mustaches.</p></div>"|8344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8344-no-depression-still-feel-gone-and-march-16-20-1992/|6.7|William Bowers

Noah
    Blumberg (aka Quarterbar, and one-time guitarist for indie band The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up) had been collaborating
    with Weapon-Shaped Records founder Eric Steuer (aka Eriksolo) since 1996, in the Santa Barbara-based hip-hop
    act mic.edu, a promising college act cut down by the tragic death of Lafura Jackson (aka A-Twice), who fell
    victim to cancer.  The duo started putting the pieces back together in 2001, dubbing their new project
    Meanest Man Contest-- probably a tongue-in-cheek reference to the dog-eat-dog mentality of the Bay Area
    boom-- and though they've been around for a couple years, <i>Merit</i> is just their first full-length.
    I assume the title refers to Lake Merritt, a shimmering and stagnant man-made body of water at the heart of
    West Oakland's most habitable district. Like the lake, <i>Merit</i> is unassuming and pleasant, and the album
    is changing how I listen to what I call ""comfort"" hip-hop, a sweeter strain of rap-inflected instrumentalism
    ranging from Populous to DJ Krush.</p><p>
    
    You could debate whether this is really a rap album: the smooth-edged instrumentals are only interrupted a
    few times by Eriksolo's earnest freestyle compositions. Reminiscent of early El-P, these passages aren't
    explicitly hip-hop; there are no hooks-- just an endless sequence of second thoughts-- but Quarterbar's
    style of sampling and sequencing is definitely born of rap music, even if his preference for pristine
    texture and melodic levity is not. He has all the verve and hunger of a bona fide beatsmith, but he's not
    suffocating under any vinyl obsession-- Quarterbar is a crate digger with delicate fingers. Oddly, his
    beats don't change up predictably; when they do evolve, they open up suddenly and without explanation, as
    if someone had ripped cotton from your ears and flung open your bedroom door.  His tracks have a kind of
    spatial coherence, each segment like a different room in the Alhambra or a smoky corner bar, or, more
    likely, your apartment.</p><p>
    
    From the beginning, <i>Merit</i> promises to be a slow-growing force for good, and it does not disappoint.
    ""Sorry"" starts heavy on a DJ Shadow tip, flicking into a tight break, while its counterpoint ""Not Sorry""
    fades in with washed-out moans, before soldiering through some chaotic cuts. Detuned guitars shimmer behind
    a dirty beat in ""Carpal Twist"", while ""Don't Die on Christmas"" juxtaposes the warmest organ with an evil
    interlude, and ""Alive in Sweet Bad Times"" works a fusion Rhodes sample into a restrained lather. Later, an
    unrelenting clav pattern jabs at a wizened female sample, ""You are obviously not an ordinary human being/ I
    promise to try no longer to take you with me.""  The rest is grindage clean and pure, enclosures blunt and
    luscious, pockets widening, hi-hats rustling and tines chiming; it's bright guitar, fat heat, and a ripped
    snare. The final track charms with a slender bolero, and it's gone.</p><p>
    
    Quarterbar is an impeccable housekeeper: his samples are always fresh, his effects always polite, and his
    textures always tasteful. All of his lilting vamps, with their no-nonsense presentation and unassuming depth,
    come scrubbed and radiant from a higher realm. Still, there's the unmistakable stain of something darker
    here, whether it's the sun-washed idleness that passes for depression on the shores of Lake Merritt, or the
    more obvious, life-changing tragedy the band's rebounding from.</p></div>"|5192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5192-merit/|8.2|Jascha Hoffman

    archetypes of the collective unconscious present was surely the open hand.  Part invitation and part warning,
    very few pictorial representations-- with the exception of the smile or frown-- are so readily recognized as
    the forward stare of the uncurled hand.  With one glance at the album cover of The Sunburned Hand of the Man's
    latest release, <i>Headdress</i>, it's apparent that the spirit of the deceased Swiss psychiatrist is alive
    and well in this musical collective hailing from the darkest recesses of Massachusetts.</p><p>
    The knit hand encircled by a background of stars embodies both the welcome and caution inherent in the music
    that is in turn violently cruel and unconformably beautiful.  The fact that it's a patchwork appendage,
    obviously tailor-made with minor imperfections magnified, displays the collective approach that more than
    likely went into the creation of the musical product itself. One imagines a procession line of long-haired
    bohemians printing and then hand-gluing album covers, inserting fresh-pressed vinyl into protective sleeves
    made from recycled rolling papers, then boxing and shipping the fresh goods away from the confines of an
    abandoned barn surrounded by three feet of mostly white snow.</p><p>
    It's from this natural and mystical bond that the music emanates effortlessly.  The opening track ""Shitless""
    presents all of the musical motifs at the band's command upfront for aural inspection.  A funky bassline and
    a smattering of odd percussion act as the soil and ground from which the guitars grow forth, as a recorder
    eventually pushes forward against a barrage of wails and grunts, more animal than human.  ""Sense of the
    Senseless"" develops from this with a steady hypnotic drone cut intermittently by bird-chirps and struck
    bells.  A polyphonic chant arises-- a modern Dies Irae-- as a whistle signals a tempo change that finds
    solace solely in the errant harmony of frantic shouting.  The song ends with a lamenting cry to ""learn from
    experience,"" before fading far too quickly into the harmonica-driven track ""The Illness"".</p><p>
    With any luck, the band will heed their own plea, as the album's only true criticism can be that, at times,
    it sounds more like a collection of inspired moments that are cut far too short than a fully developed
    composition, more than likely a consequence of its finite medium.  Brief windows of ingenuity such as the
    echo and din of the title track or the droning ebb and flow of ""A Second Guess"" would find more time to
    breathe, develop, and recapitulate given the format of a double album.  As is, though, songs such as ""Yes,
    Your Highness"" don't have time to pick up the momentum of such Varèse-pleasing ideas as the use of sirens
    and strong complex rhythms incorporated into regular song structure.</p><p>
    This is not to say that the entire album feels abruptly halted or rushed, as ""The Underground Press"" proves
    contrary.  Easily the most developed piece, if not the best, this is the swaying back and forth number on
    the album that allows the girl wearing the kitten ears at the live show to feel that she's comfortable
    enough with the crowd and herself to take off her shirt.  Stravinsky himself would be proud of this
    unadulterated use of rhythm and beat, augmented by loud hypnotic chords pulsing from a variety of instruments,
    ultimately falling prey to the screams and whoops that herald its necessary finale.</p><p>
    Acting as a subtle trend in the album, the sense of prevalent necessity from song to song further merits one
    of the superior critiques that can be lauded upon a work of art, the discrimination of timelessness.  This
    is not to say that the album could have been released at any given time with similar acclaim-- though it
    undoubtedly could have-- it's only a comment upon how the music flows so readily with complete and utter
    disdain for trend and fashion that it feels simultaneously primitive and advanced, while retaining every
    bit of its musical relevance.  In the end, the music leaves one with a sense of somber contentment and
    satisfaction as mysterious in origin as the warmth received from the open-hand greeting of a stranger.</p></div>"|7569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7569-headdress/|9.0|Andrew Bryant

    block. Daily, like live-action <i>Gummo</i>, they stand in front of their
    house and throw rocks at the gas station across the street. When they get
    a hit they chuckle at each other, get loud and rowdy.  Despite their
    pejorative comments about other races and the fact that they're as white
    as the cream inside a fresh Twinkie, they refer to one another as ""nigga,""
    ad infinitum. So I ask you, is this awkward brotherly love or a pantomime
    of toughness?</p><p>
    
    I sort of admire these hapless dorks for managing to exist at the top of
    their trailer-park game within super-hip/ultra-prissy Williamsburg, that
    erstwhile no-wave village in the heart of Brooklyn. Considering the cultural
    context, when you watch the obliviousness unfold on a daily basis, it
    becomes almost touching: Beavis and Butthead laughing it up as everyone
    walking past in turn laughs at them.</p><p>
    
    Though to be fair, I guess the kid
    with the faux-hawk has someone else in stitches, as does the girl with the
    lines shaved into the side of her head, Yeah Yeah Yeahs t-shirt torn just
    so around the collar.  Because I'm a fucking sap, I feel bad for these guys
    (all of them). And when I feel bad I pretend their shtick is a weird
    anthropology experiment, that one day they'll pull off their Coors t-shirts
    and baggy jeans and yell surprise, joke's on you, over-analytical prick!
    
    While listening to The D4-- four lads from Auckland, New Zealand who play
    lifeless garage rock about getting drunk, partying, heartbreaking chicks,
    and living it up all rocker-like-- I had a similar embarrassed, repulsed,
    nervous reaction. And, you know, I wasn't about to make fun; instead, I'd
    have just liked to tell them to open their eyes and stop navel-gazing, to
    see what exists around them, to perhaps move on.</p><p>
    
    But then, the lack of immediacy on <i>6twenty</i> is striking, like time
    gave out in a really bad way the day before meaning was invented: you wake
    up dizzy and pasty in a garage somewhere and realize all you know how to do
    is get drunk and point your guitar at your friends like a gun. Bang, bang.
    Ha, ha. The guitar isn't a real gun, though, so you can't touch them. When
    you try-- kaplow!-- stolen notes mug for the camera in slow-motion. You
    chump, your own guitar licks are laughing at you! Soon enough your solo's
    acting in its own backyard revue about time lost called <i>Party Really
    F**kin' Hard, YEAH: The Musical</i>.  The existential finale:</p><p>
    
    ""Son, time's a-wastin'. And I'm wasted, dude.""</p><p>
    
    ""Maybe time's not gone, pop. Maybe in the garage world, the minutes are
    stacked differently, the seconds otherwise weighted. Like it takes an
    hour to shit, one second to die, a year to grow sideburns. Dig?""</p><p>
    
    ""Good point, son. Now rock out all pretty just like daddy taught ya.""</p><p>
    
    The music swells, then goes limp. Poor kid hasn't even reached puberty, how's
    he expected to carry on the traditions of his more talented forefather?</p><p>
    
    Looking like Michael J. Fox clones decked out in garage rock gear, The D4
    present aural amnesia with the lyrical complexity of an even less non-ironic
    Andrew WK:</p><p>
    
    ""Get up, get out, get loose, etc.""</p><p>
    
    ""Come on, come on.""</p><p>
    
    ""I'm runnin' on empty.""</p><p>
    
    ""I want you, baby...""</p><p>
    
    ""Here I stand with my heart in my hands...""</p><p>
    
    It's days like this I long for lyrical abstraction.</p><p>
    
    Rock was always kind of stupid-- that's part of the fun-- but when did it
    become entirely, unrelentingly dumbassed?  And I'm not talking about
    intellectual capacities. Stupidity isn't measured by IQ tests or reading
    lists: it's what you do. I mean stupidity as no-soul alienation from the
    self, obliviousness to your own badness. Oh, where have all the New York
    Dolls gone...</p><p>
    
    That's the easy dismissal of an easily forgotten band, but I want to go
    further. We already have The Datsuns and they're equally lame. What's with
    garage? These groups are so obviously coping sounds, styles, and band
    philosophies from contemporaries, distant historical facsimiles, and the
    Estrus records back catalog that it's self-reflexive parody from the second
    the first pick slide occurs.</p><p>
    
    I'll be nice. I'll be positive.</p><p>
    
    They love the Buzzcocks.  You can't fault that.  Also, they're from New
    Zealand. Solid enough country. The one vocalist/guitarist, Johnny Christmas,
    seems to be balding somewhat gracefully. Or his hair's just really stringy
    and he has a high forehead. The bass player reminds me of Alex James from
    Blur, but possibly sober. They played David Letterman, which means maybe my
    dad knows about them. They formed in 1998, a bit before the garage rock
    revival. Not bad.</p><p>
    
    But dig deeper and see where being nice gets you.</p><p>
    
    They cover Guitar Wolf's ""Invader Ace"". Guitar Wolf covers?  The best song
    of the stinkin' lot is the cover of ""Pirate Love"" by Johnny Thunders, but
    only because Thunders knew how to write a song. ""Party"" is the Bay City
    Rollers minus the guy with the large package. Or maybe it's ""Working for the
    Weekend"" with less impressive drumming.</p><p>
    
    The D4 are like the nerdy aliens in a bad Hollywood film who land somewhere
    out west and decide to mimic a band of soulful earthlings. But the problem
    is the aliens lack nuance, forward thinking, and any sense of aesthetic
    understanding. When they perform an awkward take on the earthlings' strange
    music, the town laughs and laughs and laughs at the ineptitude... and I have
    to turn off the TV because I feel bad for them.</p><p>
    
    A private note to Flying Nun: I know shit's changed and nationalism's getting
    more important in the light of the American machine and I try to fight the
    good fight against whimpering and wallowing, but I do remember a time-- not
    so long ago-- when your label was completely and irrevocably synonymous with
    quality. And it was through labels like you that I first learned of and greedily
    consumed the haunting songs of Cakekitchen, Peter Jefferies, and The Terminals,
    as well as the smart pop of Chris Knox, and the noise of The Dead C. Was a
    goddamn sheep-infested Eden if I ever heard one!  What happened to the knowledge
    of good and evil?</p></div>"|2124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2124-6twenty/|2.8|Brandon Stosuy

    incredible.  An unsightly wash of black and burgundy was yelling at me to check for releases from Mr. Lif,
    Aesop Rock, and relative newcomers Cannibal Ox.  I knew if El-Producto had remotely anything to do with
    these projects that this little-label-that-could would easily rise from the ashes of Rawkus Records.  And
    this was excitement that hit me before I got to the fine print: ""Coming Soon: full-length from Murs of
    Living Legends.""  Not only would this label rise from those ashes, it would sweep them up and use them for
    gunpowder.</p><p>
    
    Almost three years later, many of us understand the monolithic Castle Grayskull of a record label Definitive
    Jux has become.  From the industrial, Orwellian paranoia of <i>Fantastic Damage</i> and <i>The Cold Vein</i>,
    to the blue-collar approach of <i>Labor Days</i>, to the ""no blood for oil!!!1!!1"" sentiments of <i>I,
    Phantom</i>, the label has attempted to make cohesive LPs in a predominately singles-oriented genre.  You'd
    be hard-pressed to find someone who refutes the idea that they have succeeded-- unless, of course, you're a
    Living Legends fan.</p><p>
    
    Living Legends devotees are the most fickle people in the musical kingdom.  If a release has the ""LLCREW""
    seal of approval, it's prematurely hailed as ""album of the millennium.""  This is not to say the West Coast
    representatives have done anything wrong-- on the contrary, their output has been some of the most consistent
    hip-hop since the underground boom of the mid-90s.  To the diehards, though, all other artists must reach the
    bar set by these Los Angelinos to be considered ""good music.""  Murs is arguably the most beloved Legend;
    terribly prolific, the man has been bringing heat for nearly ten years.  Hearing he would be making moves
    with a Def Jux collective that practically oozes New York has been shocking to many, but for both Company
    Flow and 3MG lovers alike, the anticipation has been for something nothing short of spectacular.</p><p>
    
    So it's odd that <i>The End of the Beginning</i> is the most <i>traditional</i> hip-hop record Def Jux has
    produced to date.  Fresh off thematically unified solo releases like the solid <i>Varsity Blues</i> and the
    underrated Slug collabo <i>Felt: A Tribute to Christina Ricci</i> (she was so fly in <i>That Darn Cat!</i>),
    Murs has been cultivating the art of storytelling in his raps for some time now.  It's this mode of rhyming
    that predominates his latest release, but only track by track.  The album lacks the dogged coherence that's
    become such a Def Jux staple.  What's left is a scattershot of tunes recorded all across the stars and bars
    from the past few years; the album is truly a collection of singles.</p><p>
    
    ""What's the problem with that, duke?"" you may be wondering.  Well, there isn't one.  The songs Murs has
    selected for the album are, for the most part, well above average.  The insanely chopped guitar sample in
    ""God's Work"" (produced by Belief) is the perfect backdrop for Murs to spit on the toils of keeping up with
    touring, holding a day job, and paying credit card bills.  One of the two Ant (of Atmosphere) contributions,
    ""Got Damned?"", is filled with simple piano frills and an accelerated soul vocal, soaked in drums that
    thunder through every four bars. Murs, in a rare moment of politicizing, gets open: ""I'm not your average
    rapper talkin' shit about the government/ It's not that I'm loving it, it's where I live/ They try to bomb
    the place where I wanna raise my kids,"" later getting all Travis Morrison on that ass with the lines, ""It
    ain't a game, there is no aim, they want America crushed/ If you don't like Bush, you're still dying with
    us.""  Perhaps even more rare, El-P's production gets outshined by an emcee.  Murs kills it on the double-time
    ""The Dance"".  Cramming ""what, you gonna bust a verse right before the guns burst/ Push your girl on the
    ground so that you can run first?"" into two measures is no simple task.</p><p>
    
    Still, the album does have its missteps.  ""Transitionz Az a Ridah"" is Murs' ode to skateboarding, rapped
    over the ambient sounds of a skate park.  Creative?  Sure.  Hella good?  Nope.  You'll also think Murs has
    been watching too much Lifetime when it comes to the track ""BT$"" (born to shop, sister!).  Nonetheless, the
    album becomes a good starting point for any newbie to Murs' discography.  Completely positive and straightforward,
    he has created the soundtrack for any 9-5er hoping for some hip-hop salvation from a schedule that doesn't
    permit time for the density of other Def Jux releases.</p></div>"|5513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5513-the-end-of-the-beginning/|7.7|Matt Kallman

Merzbow, Can ""Khan"" Oral, Alec Empire: not one had the balls
    to be straight with her during the recording of <i>No Games No Fun</i>, to take her aside and let her know
    the album was slowly but surely devolbing into one of the biggest piles of shit in DHR or DHR-related
    history.  Though the Digital Hardcore aesthetic has rubbed off all over her-- Elias talk-sings and spouts
    cold electro soundbytes over the album's cacophonous drones and drum machines-- she's completely unable to
    translate her message into effective lyrical content, and it's this inability to present insight into the
    issues that stoke her rage-- gender equality and pseudo-politics among them-- that render <i>No Games No Fun</i> 
    so utterly pointless.</p><p>
    
    DHR artists are, in general, more passionate than articulate in their music, preferring their abused hardware
    and uncomplicated war cries over detailed explanations of their political views. Elias tries to simplify
    things even more, and in the process severely dumbs down her angle with insipid codas and strained vocal
    performances; otherwise catchy tracks like the skuzzy ""The Bee"" and Alec Empire's ""You Suck""-- an
    orchestral cousin to ""Shards of Pol Pottery""-- are wasted. Head producer C.H.I.F.F.R.E can't seem to reconcile
    Elias' inert, listless vocals with the demented machines that pound away behind her; his solution-- 
    dumping extra layers of industrial distortion onto his compositions, in hopes of  distracting from the unavoidable 
    flatness of the finished product, doesn't hold up.  Is it easier to program an elaborate yet terrible piece of electronic 
    music than to tell a girl she shouldn't quit her day job?</p><p>
    
    For proof of Hanin Alias' shortcomings as a frontwoman and singer/songwriter, look no further than the
    opening cut, ""Catpeople"" (a collab with actor Mario Mentrup) and the obliviously hilarious rap that she
    lays down on ""You Suck"".  An inexplicable acoustic ditty, ""Catpeople"" approximates a sort of stoned tropicalia,
    but the cringe-inducing refrain (""I wanna play with you/ I wanna stay with you/ I wanna get rid of you/ But
    now I don't know"") and Elias' meowing wouldn't go over at a grade school open mic. After a complete listen
    to <i>No Games No Fun</i>, it's apparent that ""You Suck"" is the best example of what's wrong with
    the album. Although the instrumentation is solid, Elias trips herself up with her unstudied politics, railing
    against male-defined sexuality and the objectification of women in a terrible rap that might be the
    inspiration for Madonna's anal MC-ing. How does Elias respond to male chauvinist pigs and dickless bastards
    who try to marginalize and abuse her? With a resounding ""You suck.""  Naturally, it's screamed ad nauseam 
    over a groaning analog synth.  If ever feminism were to do a little house cleaning, Elias would find
    herself in a bag on the curb for such a juvenile retort, the doors of the movement slamming behind her.</p><p>
    
    Within the ATR unit, Elias  wielded her revolutionary power more admirably, working better as a component
    in the anarchist machine than the whole engine. <i>No Games No Fun</i> finds Elias trying on shoes that are
    just too damn big, and it's a crying shame no one told her before she hit the town wearing them.</p></div>"|2749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2749-no-games-no-fun/|2.1|Mark Martelli

    lend itself very well to aggressive analysis.  Not every piece of music begs for intellectual immersion, and
    of course, not every listener is ready to conduct such an extensive investigation.  In fact, most people
    probably don't waste much time with these things at all, so why should I?  I remember how looking for patterns
    in <i>Confield</i> basically got me nowhere, except to notice that chaos isn't as perfect, crystalline as
    its made out to be by misunderstood mathematicians and restless musicians.  <i>Confield</i>'s chaos was
    digital, but it was also a great mess in places, merely strangely beautiful in others.  Yet, despite my
    considerable missing of the point (and for all I know, I still am), its spark was clear.  Sean Booth and
    Rob Brown constructed a fiber-thin moonscraper of a system: I'm not sure any of it would stand up in the
    face of analysis, but most of it tears down my attempts without much effort.</p><p>
    
    I've never heard Autechre's music, especially their more recent stuff, described as ""inspirational"" or
    ""brilliant"",  just ""complex"" and ""mathematical"" (and ""cold"" and ""distant"" and a catalog of other words
    that aren't technically bad, but are never written to mean anything good in music).  Somehow, their chaos
    is ""complicated,"" while real-life chaos is a crisis, capable of changing lives.  As I see it, <i>LP5</i>,
    <i>EP7</i> and <i>Confield</i> are near-miraculously compact capsules of a state that would, in nature,
    engulf everything in its paths, and maybe as a consequence, something few people would want to approach.</p><p>
    
    Well, it just so happens <i>Draft 7.30</i> is a return to form for folks who thought all that gibberish I
    spouted over <i>Confield</i> was, well, gibberish.  If you're old enough to remember beats, none of the
    ones on this record will escape your ear.  Also caught are bits of melody that, rather than obscured behind
    nine layers of software, are often heard in broad daylight.  And another thing: even with an hour of pristine,
    possibly perfect edifices of light and head-bobbing structures, it's possible you don't notice the music is
    playing.</p><p>
    
    At this point, <i>Draft 7.30</i> makes its most powerful impressions via the noise it fends off rather than
    the tunes it emits.  ""Theme of Sudden Roundabout"" (in a rare populist move with coherent titling) lays its
    squelching beat down for all to see, and its melody, efficient in the extreme, is faintly reminiscent of
    the minimal watercolor of their more tuneful labelmates.  Dispensing with the systematic analysis, I'd say
    it's pleasant, but not essentially interesting, a bit like the ultimate IDM museum piece, <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i>--
    although, Autechre are hardly producing ""micro"" music of any kind here.  This is Macro is the truest sense,
    and yet, despite its intricate thousands of details, few combinations produce that old kinetic spark.</p><p>
    
    The opener ""Xylin Room"" hits an uptempo, polyrhythmic stutter beat to the tune of Autechre's patented
    thud-bass and various cut-up synth noises, all in and out, over and tumble, as if the arrangement could
    never be made busy <i>enough</i>.  But a fucked-up beat is a beat nonetheless, and when the actual
    ""xylin""phones hit, it's clear that this tune might well be the duo's take on bossa nova.  It's a hard way
    to wrench a groove out of static air, but to me it sounds pretty convincing, so even if it fails to fill
    a dancefloor, it holds the ear at home.  ""IV VV IV VV VIII"" is back to <i>Confield</i> school, albeit
    slightly stripped down.  Somehow, the duo manages to obscure the beat without ever covering it up entirely,
    off-center snare slaps and cavernous echo notwithstanding.</p><p>
    
    It's not all beat-fuckery, for once, as the brief ""Tapr"" proves.  It begins with the drop of a plexus on
    glitched-up vinyl, more reverb, seemingly random synth tones and a whirlwind of low thuds and piano altered
    to an almost unrecognizable degree.  Without pause, this ornery vignette segues into the epic, relentlessly
    varied ""Surripere"".  Over its ten-plus minute course, a fairly simple electro-funk backbeat is transformed
    into chattering, squishing metallic flutter, the end result of which doesn't so much resolve to the duo's
    usual silver-blue noise as bump up against a brick wall, as if they just ran out of ways to mess with the
    same group of semiquavers.  Fittingly, at best, it's a move towards the brink despite frustratingly
    stationary stretches; at worst, it might not be worth the time.</p><p>
    
    Of course, as with most Autechre releases, there will probably be considerable differences in reception for
    <i>Draft 7.30</i>.  Since it doesn't break much new ground, there will be many who dismiss it quickly
    (perhaps without giving it a fair shake); others will be only too glad to see Booth and Brown return to
    more straightforward grounds, even if they don't quite reach their mid-90s peak as melodic technicians;
    still others may hear a logical progression from <i>Confield</i>, pointing to the group's use of a similar
    sound palette to make a very different journey.  My guess is that there's some truth in all of those
    viewpoints, though in the end, I'm left with the sinking feeling that, as criticism goes, an unfortunate
    combination of familiar methods, beats and timbres won't overshadow the ultimately uninspiring music.</p></div>"|364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/364-draft-730/|6.2|Dominique Leone

It seems only yesterday that they dropped an ambitious,
    double-disc album on me, and now Lenola vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Sean Byrne hits me with yet another
    disc from his Twin Atlas side project. It's the duo's fifth album since 2000, if you include the as-yet
    unreleased <i>Inside the Skate Scandal</i>. The other Twin is Lucas Zaleski, and with their powers combined,
    the two make some pretty enjoyable music.  Understandably, with Byrne handling lots of vocals here, it
    comes off something like Lenola lite, which, as it turns out, is actually kind of a good thing.</p><p>
    
    See, Byrne's songwriting thrives when it's stripped of Lenola's busy psychedelic accompaniment and just
    allowed to present itself to you.  Lenola's swirl can be enthralling, but sometimes it distracts from the
    melodies, and here, those melodies are laid out on top of laidback, sparse guitars, slow tempos, and
    gently glowing keyboards.  Perhaps even more than Lenola, The Twin Atlas evoke the fluorescent folk of
    The Kinsgbury Manx, and the close harmonies smeared up and down this record drive the comparison home even
    further.</p><p>
    
    The lilting acoustic strum and bold vocals of opener ""Sun Touches Down"" immediately set you down in a very
    comfortable place, but things really pick up on the song that follows, the excellent ""Show Me All"".  Drum
    programming mixes with live drumming and subdued lead guitar, building to a fantastically layered chorus in
    which lead and background vocals weave in a classic call-and-response.  Speaking in terms of pure sonics,
    though, The Twin Atlas have roughly the same problem as recent Lenola: homogeneity.  The album's sonic character
    is so consistent that things bleed together at times, particularly when you get a run of similarly paced
    songs in the middle of the record.  However, with the heavy production emphasis on melody, tracks like
    ""Beautiful Surprise"" can't help but differentiate themselves from the pack.</p><p>
    
    Another part of what makes <i>Bring Along the Weather</i> work so well is its brevity-- at 39 minutes and
    14 songs, it's shorter than any of the duo's previous releases (their debut, <i>The Philadelphia Parking
    Authority Must Die</i>, had 26 songs on it), and the discretion shows in the consistent quality of the
    material.  Indeed, the band themselves remark that they implemented a stricter editing process while putting
    this album together-- ""y'know, make it more like a proper album, less like a bloated time-capsule,"" as they
    put it on their website.  That approach seems to have paid off nicely, as The Twin Atlas have slipped a
    quietly ingratiating mickey to us with <i>Bring Along the Weather</i>, a fine companion piece to the
    headier sounds of Lenola.</p></div>"|8215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8215-bring-along-the-weather/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    of Rock history, but paper similarities aside-- each duo brazenly, turbulently rehashing American blues
    tradition through a minimalist storm of scraping guitars and bruised skins-- they've got almost nothing in
    common.  The Black Keys may just be a couple of white dudes from Akron, but they seem closer in spirit to
    something that Muddy Waters himself might've considered ""the blues"" than to any midwestern bar-band's
    approximation of it.  The only Stripes link of any importance, in fact, is that the Keys' previous album
    was better, too.</p><p>
    
    Last year's <i>The Big Come-Up</i> introduced the garage-grime and ""white Hendrix"" croon of The Sonics to
    the unholy strut of Junior Kimbrough's legendary guitar lines, fusing them into a spitting, spewing, 40-ton
    monster.  Winners like ""Heavy Soul"" evoked the primal ballet of Fordzilla crushing unmanned Buicks, and when
    it wasn't busy flattening rides, still offered a glimpse of the delicate machinery under the hood with soul
    cuts like ""I'll Be Your Man"".  With <i>Thickfreakness</i>, the once-massive guitar is exponentially weightier,
    thicker, and juicier, swelling to Earth-shaking proportions, at the unfortunate loss of a little subtlety.
    But that's just the way it is sometimes; there's no room for luxuries like nuanced variations in tone, or
    shifting rhythms when you're fleeing from a fire-breathing behemoth.</p><p>
    
    Still, swallow enough white-hot blues riffs and you get heartburn; it's hard not to miss <i>Come-Up</i>'s
    pace-breaking exercises like ""Countdown"" or ""Them Eyes"" after blues explosion #348 (and counting).  Even
    at its most delicate, Dan Auerbach's fretwork still hits like a hollowbody that's been filled with cement,
    and Patrick Carney's swaying grooves seem suppressed, driven further back in the mix.  Once again, the Keys
    stomp as violently and elementally as before, but they nearly get carried away.  Tracks like ""If You See Me""
    and ""Hurt Like Mine"" attempt to reduce <i>Thickfreakness</i>' wildfire to merely a controlled burn, but even
    when the Keys try to play it cool on this album, they still run hot.  Nothing strays too far from the molten
    desperation of a more typical offering of ""Midnight"" or an uber-faithful cover of The Sonics' ""Have Love Will
    Travel"".</p><p>
    
    Ah, but who'm I kidding?  <i>Thickfreakness</i> may veer towards oppressively monolithic, but it's also
    equal parts sincerity and devotion, thunder and lightning, majesty and naked anger.  Look upon the power of
    the title track, mortals, and despair!  The central riff splits heaven and earth, and for a few brief minutes,
    commands all your attention as you fear for your very life; it's an exorcism, a catharsis.  And it only gets
    thicker and freakier from there, lurching into the cautionary force of the too-similar ""Hard Row""; like a
    simplified, but equally relentless version of its predecessor, the simple bluster is momentarily awe-inspiring.
    When Auerbach howls, ""It's a hard row to hoe by yourself,"" the release is overwhelming.</p><p>
    
    But sure enough, the intensity of the opening combination proves impossible to maintain for long.  Though the
    stutter-stepping percussion and racing, rise/fall soloing of ""Set You Free"" nearly succeeds at preserving the
    pummeling drive beyond all limits of human endurance, it ends up being the most purely entertaining cut on
    the album simply out of the necessity for respite.  The body braces itself for another towering blast after
    being further skewered by Auerbach's nasty hooks in the opening seconds, and gets (only a little) less than
    that, but the relaxation is welcome.  From that point on, <i>Thickfreakness</i> begins to run together
    slightly, though as mentioned earlier, not for lack of energy.</p><p>
    
    The related concerns of a need for a bit more understatement and variety hinder the Black Keys this time
    around, but remain somewhat insignificant in relation to their even-more-muscular blues attack.  On top of
    that, the ultra-minimal echoes of ""Cry Alone"" and the R.L. Burnside-as-channeled-thru-MC5 tangle of ""Hold
    Me in Your Arms"" partially ameliorates the somewhat pervasive sameness, closing the album with a distinctly
    different sound than they've yet shown.  All told, the shortcomings are relative to what the duo already
    proved themselves capable of on <i>The Big Come-Up</i>; <i>Thickfreakness</i> isn't quite their debut, but
    it's still a powerhouse, even exceeding its ancestor in total spectacle.  Raw rock grandeur as so frequently
    conjured up on this album is hard to come by in any capacity; if that means having to overlook a few minor
    flaws, it's worth it.</p></div>"|766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/766-thickfreakness/|7.7|Eric Carr

    drawings that adorned hundreds of albums in the late 60s, with one key difference: the artwork featured
    only two colors, black and silver, rather than the usual rainbow swirl.  Proceeding beyond the gatefold,
    Bruce, Baker &amp; Clapton proved on that album's two discs (one live, one studio) the seemingly illogical
    hypothesis that psychedelic music could be utterly monochromatic, making the odd cover art strikingly apropos.
    Granted, there were some great songs on that album-- their excellent versions of ""Born Under a Bad Sign"" and
    ""Crossroads"" (and, of course, you can't fuck with ""White Room"")-- but the album's rigorous overall consistency
    in tone and color made it remarkably dull as a whole.</p><p>
    
    35 years later, along comes Lenola, with another double album that proves psychedelic music can still be
    pretty monochromatic, a full generation after the term came into being.  I'm not making any musical
    comparison between Lenola and Cream at all: Cream's brand of psychedelia sat heavily on blues for its
    foundation, while Lenola are the product of something altogether different, more pastoral and more modern.
    Since losing original bassist Scott Colan and expanding into a quintet, they seem to have been hit to death
    in the future head, basking in the glow of the Flaming Lips and borrowing whole chapters from the book of
    Mercury Rev whilst largely kicking to the curbside the UK shoegazer influences that shaped their early
    records.  In short, they're drawing from a host of sources either directly or tangentially related to Lips
    producer Dave Fridmann, but the honeyed harmonies that coat each song have a certain whiff of 70s AM gold
    about them as well-- several of these songs could easily be in the same subdivision as ""Our House"".</p><p>
    
    Lenola take a decidedly rockist approach to their influences, building remarkably lush sounds for a home
    recording but steering widely clear of the incandescent orchestration the Lips and the Rev are so taken
    with these days.  The unfortunate thing is that the band's songwriting process churns out twenty decent
    tracks, but almost none of them stand out: the two discs are for the most part interchangeable.  That the
    second disc is generally slower-paced and less memorable than the first only makes the album feel much
    longer than its combined 82 minutes.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Eternal"", is particularly great, however, giving the guitars one last moment of complete
    dominance before setting them back next to the numerous keyboards that have found their way into the band's
    stable.  The song is one of the few that employs a real climax, opening with fervent strumming and swelling
    harmonies and ultimately bursting into a fuller texture borne on pounding drums, all the while flaunting
    some nice fretboard fireworks.  ""Sudden Stop"" stands out as well, employing a jittery rhythm, and strange,
    woozy modulations that throw the verses somewhat off kilter; ""Gentleman Overboard"" brings in luminescent
    keys and bells to highlight the chord structure and create a countermelody to the vocals over the album's
    liveliest beat.</p><p>
    
    Yet, despite some good material, <i>Sharks and Flames</i> ultimately succumbs to that age-old double album
    curse: it just doesn't need to be as long as it is, and with some editorial discretion, it could have been
    much easier to swallow.  There's no reason for a plodding song like ""Traffic Lights"" to stretch beyond five
    minutes (or make the cut at all, really), and I get the general feeling that the number at the top of this
    review would be higher if the cutting room floor were more cluttered.  Lenola are a Good Band, but if I
    might borrow a sentiment from fellow scribe Matt LeMay, they've yet to make a Great Album.  <i>Sharks and
    Flames</i> shows it's not for lack of trying, but, for now, Lenola remain a possibility, perhaps capable of
    something better.</p></div>"|4736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4736-sharks-and-flames/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    to inflate it from fledgling dream to full-blown phenomenon.  After a strong run at the end of its first
    calendar year with the Cannibal Ox and Aesop Rock records, 2002 saw Def Jux drop Bush-worthy bombs in the
    form of RJD2's <i>Deadringer</i> and Mr. Lif's <i>I Phantom</i>.  Yet the heaviest waves were reserved for
    the impresario himself, as El-P unleashed his first post-Company Flow work upon the hip-hop world with the
    jawdropping beauty that was <i>Fantastic Damage</i>.  Picking up exactly where he had left off with that
    groundbreaking trio's demise, <i>Fantastic Damage</i> showcased both E-L-dash's incomparable production
    talent (particularly for anyone who slept on Can Ox's <i>The Cold Vein</i>) and his considerable skills
    as an MC.  Of course, Co-Flow fans already knew and revered his gifts behind the boards and the mic, but
    the hype accumulated by the label's growing reputation as the Motown of indie hip-hop only increased the
    record's promise for impact.</p><p>
    
    These days, instrumental hip-hop albums are generally suspect.  Since <i>The Instrumentalyst</i>, it's
    almost as if hip-hop crews feel an obligation-- the only problem being that not every extended family member
    is Dan the Automator.  At best, they do offer some exposure for potentially overlooked DJs or producers; at
    worst they give someone the chance for some private (or public) fun, karaoke-style.  But let's not forget
    that El-P released an instrumental hip-hop album (<i>Little Johnny from the Hospitul</i>) with Company Flow
    that wasn't just a ""vocals surgically removed"" version of the already-hit record, but rather a fully
    conceived collection of instrumental tracks created by El-P and Mr. Len specifically for that project.  In
    other words, the man has a little more cred than DJ Average or some other producer trying to milk his record
    for another dollar or two-- and furthermore, it made perfect sense for him to release an instrumental version
    of the Cannibal Ox record, especially considering that Vast Aire and Vordul are an admittedly acquired tastes
    as far as MCs go.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to <i>Fandam Plus</i>, the instrumental companion to <i>Fantastic Damage</i>.  While it's
    certainly no replacement for the original-- a record justifiably present on any 2002 top-ten list that
    matters-- it does offer some valuable insights into El-P's production that aren't readily apparent on the
    vocal version.  Take ""DeLorean"", for example, which, without the distraction of Ill Bill's knuckleheaded
    guest verse about getting his dick sucked in a strip club by a cokehead, shows how truly amazing the bridge's
    breakbeat is.  ""Truancy"" provides another test case, one in which the lack of El-P's stream-of-consciousness
    wordflow reveals the beat as the illegitimate offspring of the Beastie Boys' ""Looking Down the Barrel of a
    Gun"".  And then there's ""Accidents Don't Happen"", which in instrumental form serves an even clearer reminder
    that El-P was incorporating Middle Eastern vibes into hip-hop (see Company Flow's ""The Fire in Which You Burn""
    from <i>Funcrusher Plus</i>) long before Missy Elliott and Timbaland made it fashionable.</p><p>
    
    Of course, just as Newton's Law prescribes, for every great moment on <i>Fandam Plus</i> there's an equal
    and opposite reaction.  ""Deep Space 9mm"", one of the original record's strongest highlights, sounds haphazard
    and clunky without El-P's meticulous verse to hold it all together.  Similarly, both the title cut and ""TOJ""
    come off rather flat without the vocals to set up each track's powerful dynamic shifts.  But of all the
    instrumental mixes, ""Dr. Hellno Vs. The Praying Mantis"" probably disappoints the most-- it's still a fine
    slice of robofunk, but gets awfully monotonous without El-P's hallucinatory sexcapade narrative.</p><p>
    
    As an added bonus, the second disc of <i>Fandam Plus</i> includes several appetite-whetting rarities that
    will most likely be the major selling point for Def Jukies.  Of the remixed audio tracks, RJD2's deconstruction
    of ""Lazerface's Warning"" satisfies most deeply, particularly for turntable-deficient fans that missed the
    12-inch on which it originally appeared.  RJD2 gives the cut a little more traditional hip-hop flavor,
    courtesy of a tastefully scratched intro, tightened-up beat and supremely sick vocal sample that he weaves
    into the very fabric of the mix.  Throw in a CD-ROM component with complete lyrics to the original album
    (to further fuel those karaoke dreams, even though you can't actually print out the damn things), the
    ""hip-hop <i>Taxi Driver</i>"" video for ""Deep Space 9mm"", and some live performance footage (including a
    version of the rare Company Flow classic ""Patriotism"", which no fan should go without hearing) and you've
    got the makings of a real collectors' package.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, what relegates <i>Fandam Plus</i> to the status of mere curiosity piece is that it really is
    just a ""vocals surgically removed"" version of <i>Fantastic Damage</i>.  After serving up a record like that,
    our man El-Producto doesn't really need to prove his skills (surgical or otherwise), but if he'd made the
    effort to remix some elements of the backing tracks or switch up the running order, he might've achieved
    something closer to a kidney transplant than a tonsillectomy.</p></div>"|2713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2713-fandam-plus-instrumentals-remixes-lyrics-video/|7.5|Scott Hreha

    Thomas' approximately 38 bands:</p><p>
<li> Scuffed-up transistor radio with a blown speaker beaming time-travelled frequencies from 1957-1967.<p>
<li> What The Beach Boys might have sounded like if they recorded in an underwater cove.<p>
<li> A warped vinyl copy of your favorite pop record played on one of those tan Fisher Price record players
    we all owned as kids.<p>
    
    If such descriptions set off the alarms of your festering indie-remorse, fear not.  Though indie rock once
    defiantly waved the banner of lo-fi production, <i>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</i> setting off a four-track reverse
    arms race over who could broadcast their music with the most slackitude and hiss-teria, I don't mean to
    trumpet that the budget sound of <i>All Your Summer Songs</i> makes it more ""real"" than a similar product
    of modern technology.  Rather, I've come to the diplomatic conclusion that intentionally beat-up production
    simply complements bands who are bent on re-examining time-worn musical ideas.</p><p>
    
    Fred Thomas' Saturday Looks Good to Me is one of these bands, a large Michigan-based collective trying
    their hand at familiar oldies-station molds: walls of sound with bricks of brass and stringed instruments,
    arpeggio-heavy prom themes, shy soul, and surf grooves with radio-friendly ambitions.  All of these songs
    are filtered through enough layers of reverb and ambient noise (courtesy of knob-twiddling from Thomas and
    His Name Is Alive's Warn Defever) to sound like they're coming from the past-their-prime speakers of Dad's
    old station wagon, a process that, paradoxically, strips them of their nostalgia and lends them fresh
    personality.</p><p>
    
    Take ""Meet Me by the Water"" as a representative sample.  Opening with snare hits that sound recorded from
    two rooms over and a wood block clack processed into liquidity, the song rides on piano and guitar parts
    that bleed reverb profusely, and stratospheric, echo chamber'd female vocals which lend an airy spaciousness
    that could handicap it for some as typical cassette indie-pop.  At least, until the dead-sincere saxophone
    solo, the verse where the elements fly off and reassemble at random in dub fashion, and the warm electric
    blanket coda of <i>Loveless</i>-style guitar.  All in less than 1/20th of an hour, radio standard time.</p><p>
    
    Different shades of these textures are evident throughout <i>All Your Summer Songs</i>, with distantly
    familiar drum tracks being manipulated into submission and orchestral ambitions being squeezed through a
    four-track to come out the other side in unexpected fashion.  Brass, string sections, and buzzsaw guitar
    fight for elbow room through the galloping ""Underwater Heartbeat"" and ""Alcohol"", while irresistibly catchy
    sections fly by before you even realize it, never to return.  ""Ambulance"", a song taken from the band's
    self-released debut, is recast here as a duet featuring Ted Leo working out his lower register over taut
    guitar and Comiskey Park organ.</p><p>
    
    Leo's not the only mild celebrity appearing on <i>All Your Summer Songs</i>; Thomas turns over the singing
    to a basement-show all-star cast including Tara Jane O'Neil and Ida's Karla Schickele.  Given the
    microphone-swapping details and torch-song performances, it's easy to think of the album as an even more
    obscure version of Stephen Merritt's 6ths album showcases, albeit stripped of the synthesizers, showtunes,
    and (save the lackluster title track) creepy baritone.  The liner notes, unfortunately, fail to offer
    beleaguered critics a key to connect the vocal dots, but I'll vouch that the women fare best: The wide-eyed
    vocals of ""Caught"" skim playfully over what sounds like my childhood church's handbell choir, and the twee
    breathiness of ""Ultimate Stars"" nests perfectly within the track's chamber take on the riff from Booker T's
    ""Time Is Tight"".  The male chorus gets stuck with the ballad catalog, but Thomas himself (I think) makes
    showstopping, cracked performances of the starry slow-dance numbers ""The Sun Doesn't Want to Shine"" and
    ""Last Hour"".</p><p>
    
    So while the album lags somewhat in the middle (""Typing"" is a little bit Belle, a little bit Sebastian),
    <i>All Your Summer Songs</i> is unshakeable and unique enough overall to be the frontrunner for Official
    Rob Mitchum Warm Weather Album '03.  With enough melodic chops to keep the project from falling into a pit
    of esoteric experimental production, and enough studio inventiveness to prevent the record from being Brian
    Wilson Love Letter #3451, Saturday Looks Good to Me seem poised to spring from tape-trading in dusty Ann
    Arbor record shops to national semi-stardom on the label emo built.  Yes, Michigan!</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|7002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7002-all-your-summer-songs/|8.6|Rob Mitchum

Whether it's Steve Reich's phase patterns, Terry
    Riley's ""C"" pulse or La Monte Young's extended tones, classical minimalism is laid out as carefully as a
    math equation.  Each note has its place; harmonic collisions are not left to chance. The sound is ordered.
    Minimalism is music for neat freaks.</p><p>
    Tim Hecker's second proper full-length under his own name, following the underrated <i>Haunt Me, Haunt Me,
    Do It Again</i> (the <i>My Love Is Rotten to the Core</i> EP was an interesting diversion but not much more),
    approaches minimalism from a messier angle. <i>Radio Amor</i>'s identifying motif is a repeated piano
    cluster. It is obviously minimalist in some respects, involving the repetition of a limited tone set, but
    something else is happening. Hecker's piano cluster sounds accidental and broken, the notes tumbling down
    haphazardly into a clump on the floor. Though each sound was likely laid out carefully in a window on
    Hecker's computer, you'd never know it. This sound idea is closer in spirit to the melody of wind chimes
    than something one hunches over a piano to work out, but it's no less striking for its seeming randomness.</p><p>
    ""Song of the Highwire Shrimper"" introduces this fantastic sound. After some hissing and shortwave radio
    static, complete with unidentifiable voices, the keyboard bit comes in. I can't tell if it's a sample or
    just my own mind connecting two nautically themed records (<i>Radio Amor</i> was inspired in part by
    Hecker's observations in a Honduran fishing village), but something about the quality of the piano in
    ""Song of the Highwire Shrimper"" reminds me of Herbie Hancock's ""Maiden Voyage"". Where Hancock tapped into
    the fixed rhythm of the tide, Hecker zooms into the chaos present inside the breaking crest of a single
    wave. Listen closely and you can hear the endlessly variable gurgling of the ocean.</p><p>
    Like <i>Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again</i>, <i>Radio Amor</i> flows one track into the next, and it really
    works best as one long piece. The choppy keyboard pattern drifts back into view several times. On ""Spectral""
    it hovers around the corners of the frame, visible only when one turns attention away from the gradually
    shifting drones that make up the bulk of the track. Here, Hecker's technique reminds me a bit of Vert's
    sonic sleight-of-hand on <i>The Köln Konzert</i>, where he plucked tiny melodic phrases from Keith Jarrett's
    similarly named solo piano album and wrapped them in layers of prickly noise. ""I'm Transmitting Tonight"" is
    also based around the stuttering melodic figure, but the noise is shot through the tones, so the piano
    phrase becomes some poorly tuned static-ridden ghost of itself.</p><p>
    The rest of <i>Radio Amor</i> floats by like an uneasy shipboard dream. Radio transmissions, which often
    serve as a seafarer's only human contact, come and go. Harmonic-rich drones morph into static and then
    return. White noise simulates the hiss of the ocean. Occasionally, as on ""Azure Azure"", Hecker incorporates
    guitar feedback and achieves something close to the raw grandeur that once made hometown pals Godspeed You
    Black Emperor! so great. By the time he gets to the closing ""Trade Winds, White Heat"" the music has calmed,
    the keyboard progression is steady and clear, and the airwave chatter is finally silenced.  <i>Radio Amor</i>
    is a brilliant soundtrack for daydreaming, and Tim Hecker's effective variations on a few central ideas
    once again show a gifted composer at work.</p></div>"|3796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3796-radio-amor/|8.3|Mark Richardson

    is due: hardly anyone appreciates the deep and complex sense of humor metalheads have about the music they
    like. They're one of a few subgroups of music fans who can take their music intensely seriously and laugh
    their asses off about it at the same time. Half of the point, after all, is to deliver that mind-boggling,
    ridiculous more: more guts, more demon oratories, more insane, unbelievable, undeniable power.  And if you
    fall over laughing at the sheer intensity of it all, so be it.</p><p>
    
    There's something of that same giddiness with electro-punk Magas.  James Marlon Magas and his wife run a
    store in Chicago called Weekend Records and Soap. They sell records, obviously: electro, microhouse, minimal
    techno, glitch, dub, and some other things-- records from labels like Bunker, Force Tracks, Bpitch Control,
    Warp, Mego, and Tigerbeat6. They also sell handmade soap. Magas also used to sing for no-wavey Chicago rockers
    Lake of Dracula, and he's got plenty of those horror-flick hesher tendencies wrapped up in his electro love:
    walk into Weekend, and you're likely to find him standing over a turntable half-banging his head to Luke
    Eargoggle or Electronicat, smiling in that kidlike way that metalheads smile when <i>Reign in Blood</i>
    is playing. He's the sort of guy who'll get awfully excited all of a sudden and say, pointing to the
    turntable, ""Wait, wait, wait, check out this part,"" at which point a German woman will shout something
    about a cat. Look back up at him and he's grinning and nodding enthusiastically.</p><p>
    
    Which is pretty much the best way to approach <i>Friends Forever</i>, his first full-length on Adult.'s
    hesher-friendly electro label Ersatz Audio. (Adult.'s Adam Lee Miller co-produces here.) The quickest way
    of getting at it is like this: Magas often sounds like an electro version of rockabilly punk favorites The
    Cramps. I'd even be tempted to try out the term ""electrobilly"" if there were any chance that anyone but
    Magas (or Quintron) were likely to make a record like this in the future. There's nothing much danceable
    going on-- just the stiff and rhythmic crack and buzz of drum machines, rock 'n' roll analog blurts, and
    the synth-noise explorations of your more ""serious"" European electro. Nothing very dark, either, despite
    all the minor-key grinds and rock yowls: Magas, as you can hear almost immediately, is having loads of fun,
    as will some hopefully decent proportion of his listeners.</p><p>
    
    You can hear it from the start, on ""Blind Contact"". A fuzzed-out synth does the rock 'n' roll bassline over
    a big wet snare drum, and then there's Magas with his deep, affected, Lux Interior/Jon Spencer sneer: ""We
    got the feeeel for the lux-jureeee, we got a taste for the gold!"" After only four lines: ""Lookout! Waaaaaah!""
    And that's the program from there on out: something like Quintron, something like Adult. on goof-off day,
    all peculiarly and entertainingly Magas. It's devotedly minimal-- usually just a drum machine, synth bass,
    and upfront, untreated vocals-- and probably way too low on variation for most. It sounds best loud. It
    ""rocks"" at points, like on ""This Is How We Do It"" (""Woke up this morning, I was looking for a fight!"") and
    gets all sneery-funky at others, like on ""Pocket Racers"". It wanders through some more complex and
    traditional electro, like the synth workout ""Love Compressor""; it rewrites ""Toys"", from the <i>Bad Blood</i>
    EP; it breaks out the piano for the closing ""Too Much Fear"", and you can almost forgive Magas for using the
    same vocal line for the third or fourth time when he sings in the title in a growly demon-voice.</p><p>
    
    When <i>Friends Forever</i> is working, it makes you chuckle and curl up your lip and sneer along: it's
    loveable and entertaining and sounds-- a rarity these days-- like people who don't take themselves too
    seriously having a good time making music. Which is lucky, because you need to be on Magas' side to forgive
    him for the record's being sort of slight: there aren't exactly a ton of different ideas being worked through
    here, and the ones that are aren't particularly complex to begin with. Much like metal-- and much like a good
    number of Ersatz releases-- this record will be a decent amount of fun for those who are ready for it, and
    sound, well, sort of stupid to everyone else.</p></div>"|5031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5031-friends-forever/|7.0|Nitsuh Abebe

    Harper is caught throwing a cute-if-cantankerous fit on camera, whining and snapping at a European journalist
    like a pot-smoking Thom Yorke.  It's funny, but not especially surprising that when faced with a middling
    reporter, Harper found his knickers in a bit of a twist: he's been misunderstood by the mainstream music
    press for nearly a decade now, and bumbling critics are at least partially to blame for the sloppily cobbled
    together batch of tracks on his latest studio release, the scattered <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i>.</p><p>
    
    Since his 1993 debut, Ben Harper has been getting all tangled up in his influences-- he's inadvertently
    hog-tied himself with big, fat superstar ropes, each woven from stringy bits of Hendrix, Redding, Marley,
    Plant, Page, and a few stray Dylan hairs.  This is as much a product of a lazy press (who relentlessly--
    aw, shit!-- point out and examine his many muses) as it is his own musical mishmash, but either way it's
    got Harper stuck and wiggling for release.  Disparate inspiration isn't a problem on its own, but Harper's
    inability to stabilize and carve himself a personality sure is.  Neo-blues-soul-metal-punk-reggae-gospel-rock-funk
    is far too cumbersome to be a proper qualifier, and <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i>'s breathless <i>Rolling
    Stone Encyclopedia of Rock</i> whirlwind is tiring, at best.  Harper's now-trademark lack of focus-- which
    is especially disappointing because dude's got skills with that slide!-- is destined to forever supercede
    his considerable songwriting talent.</p><p>
<i>Diamonds on the Inside</i> opens with its first single, ""With My Own Two Hands"", an optimistic and
    aggressively reggae-inspired bit of dancehall wah-wah, complete with Hammond B3, clavinet, and high, lazy
    backing vocals.  Harper swings effortlessly from a low, throaty growl to his excellent soul falsetto, and
    the rich, dynamic percussion (Oliver Francis Charles on drums) works remarkably well here.  It's what happens
    next that gives pause: the sparse, southern gospel romp ""When It's Good"" stars a completely different breed
    of Harper, blues-driven and virtually unaccompanied (save a box of rocks, some background singers, and his
    acoustic slide).</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the title track is a thick, sentimental Lynyrd Skynyrd guitar throwdown, featuring a singalong
    chorus and sweet, lilting pedal steel, electric piano, bass, and guitars; the aptly titled ""Bring the
    Funk"" is pure gimmick, all synthesizers and poorly channeled Parliament. ""So High So Low"" is heavy,
    Zeppelin-inspired metal thrashing, kick-started by some kind of otherworldly primal scream.  And on and
    on: slices of this and chunks of that.  Slow down, Harps, I'm getting freakin' confused!  What kind of
    goulash you serving here, anyway?</p><p>
    
    Despite <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i>'s pointed identity crisis, there are still some standout songs.
    Ladysmith Black Mambazo pop up on the vocals-only ""Picture of Jesus"", which, despite its heavy-handed
    religious meditations, is a textured, vigorous, and engaging contemporary hymn.  The brisk and solo-friendly
    ""Touch from Your Lust"" (seriously, what does that mean?) would have fit nicely on <i>Burn to Shine</i>, with
    its Lenny Kravitz bellbottom howls and heavy electric guitar noodling.</p><p>
    
    Harper has never been a particularly keen lyricist, but the introductory line of ""When She Believes"" (""The
    good Lord is such a good Lord/ With such a good Mother, too"") is especially ridiculous, and the ""Behind
    all of your tears/ There's a smile/ Behind all of the rain/ There's a sunshine for miles and miles"" of
    ""Everything"" seems equally uninspired.  To the contrary, new-favorite-word ""shuck"" is employed superbly in
    ""Bring the Funk"" (""Some are jiving/ Some are shuck/ Some are just down on their luck"").</p><p>
    
    To his immense credit, Ben Harper pulls off rock star posturing even though he sits in a chair while playing
    live (an achievement Jagger has not yet approached-- maybe this explains the incessant arena-touring?), and
    his performances are always charismatic affairs, especially if you're okay with little kids dancing shirtless
    outside.  It's onstage that Harper excels, his humble grace and organic porch singing somehow capable of
    tugging sunburned college students away from the falafel tent and back to the main stage; live, his scattered
    influences are far less distracting and his playing takes on a more even and consistent edge.</p><p>
    
    Other artists have played the don't-pigeonhole-me card with slightly more success-- Beck unapologetically
    flits between genres and styles, but has enough sense (or enough handlers) to centralize his records in a
    way that makes them thematically comprehensible.  Even when artists self-consciously draw from a long,
    complicated lineage of diverse sounds and tactics, there still needs to be an organizing principle; ideally,
    individual tracks should contribute something substantial to the greater whole, like a chapter in a novel
    or a stanza in a poem, each cohesive, directed, and pushing towards a narrative payoff.  All fourteen tracks
    here are autonomous, but as a record, <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i> feels pretty empty.</p></div>"|3747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3747-diamonds-on-the-inside/|6.5|Amanda Petrusich

""Do you really think Pitchfork
    will like it, sir?  Why, where are the extended metaphors?""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, I was going to pretend to be a reviewer from a time before Spiral Scratch who'd been visited by this

    ""Okay, Noel, sure, why not?  Let's see... well, sometimes musical genres get together, just like mommies and

    the latter-- they produce a new genre.  And it starts out very cute and lovable, sure, but soon it begins to
    whine and demand and smell funny and then, wham, it gets dropped off a bridge or left in a deacon's mailbox
    or...""</p><p>
    
    ""Surely, Mr. Reid, you're not blaming the Buzzcocks for creating all of pop/punk!"" Sophie Higgins chirped.
    ""Certainly, most of it is wretched, but you can't hold them responsible for what's come afterwards.""</p><p>
    
    ""I'm blaming them for making it look too easy, Sophie.  When the Buzzcocks started, punk was still something
    of a reaction against pop, and combining the two has always been a rock-paper-scissors sort of affair-- punk
    bludgeons the nuance out of pop, and pop sweetness neuters punk attitude.  A straight mixture of the two
    almost always ends up as musical slapstick, and for pop/punk to work in any context besides novelty, the
    balance has to be close to perfect.  Even though the Buzzcocks sounded like they were always playing with
    complete abandon-- er, sorry, poor choice of words, kids-- they had the instincts and the songwriting
    talent to hit that mark with decent frequency.  Most every band that followed them didn't.  Pop/punk
    pretty much turned out to be a one-trick genre, and the Buzzcocks were that trick.""</p><p>
    
    ""That's a lot of past tense, Mr. Reid,"" observed Alexis Chittenden.  ""Are we, the Buzzcocks' fans, also
    orphans, in a sense, sir?""</p><p>
    
    ""Okay, so look at it like this.  Blink-182 and Good Charlotte are the mean old orphanage proprietors Mr.
    and Mrs. Nesbitt, and Green Day is that old gentleman who used come by with candy every once in a while
    before he died in the mandolin accident: It feels like they've been gone forever, but the Buzzcocks were
    only ever really broken up for a large chunk of the 80s (negligible, given the fact that they're pushing
    thirty as a band).  They've been a steady act for over a decade now, though; the past tense refers to the
    fact that their best material has always been the stuff that does the least to disturb the distortion/melody
    accord they struck in the late 70s.  And, while the Buzzcocks have wisely passed on innovation with this
    new album, they also display only an intermittent control of that distinctive touch that makes the pop/punk
    marriage worthwhile.""</p><p>
    
    ""L-losing their touch, sir?"" Nevil Greenleaf stammered, his rheumy eyes moistening.</p><p>
    
    ""Well, maybe not losing it... their albums were always spotty, and few fans ever see the need to probe
    beyond <i>Singles Going Steady</i>.  And, true, a couple of these songs would be right at home on that
    comp.  'Friends', for instance, finds the band's component parts in inspired cooperation-- the breezy
    melody, giddily climbing chord progression, and chainsaw guitars all work to whittle the angstful central
    assertion, 'I don't even know if I'll ever be loved again/ The only thing I can rely on is chay-ee-ange!'
    down to snotty-sincere perfection.  Most, however, fail by inches, not quite tight enough to hold their
    charm for more than a few listens.  'Sick City Sometimes' works brilliantly as an anthem as long as you
    can keep the image of Andrew W.K. covering the Gin Blossoms' 'Hey Jealousy' out of your head.  The
    resurrected Howard Devoto-era gem 'Lester Sands', while sharp as ever, only suffers from the much cleaner
    production and Pete Shelley's newly acquired snarl.  In fact, a lot of the album's problems come from
    overaggressiveness; the further the balance tips toward loud-and-fast, the deeper the split in their
    musical personality show.  The Buzzcocks have never needed to bash a chorus into our heads as mercilessly
    as they do here on 'Keep On' and 'Morning After', and the grinding fade-outs of each song seem to announce
    the cynic's ultimate victory over the sensitive.""</p><p>
    
    ""But sir, we need both!"" cried Alvin Witherspoon-Devonshire.  ""How ever are we to deal with our wretched
    lives without their cheeky take on childhood angst?""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, the Buzzcocks have moved on, Alvin.  They've still got angst to spare, but their wit has been ground
    down by 'maturity,' or whatever you want to call it, into a bitter thing that saps a lot of that reckless
    energy.  Sure, it's great when Shelley matter-of-factly snots into mortality's handkerchief with his
    declaration that 'Life's only temporary/ And then you fucking die!' on the final track, but the drawn-out
    instrumental interlude and guitar solo drag that pissed-off punch towards mopery.  But, <i>you</i> don't
    have to move on, Alvin!  You don't have to imagine a grand, noble death for them, as you have for your
    parents; The Buzzcocks have left you <i>Singles Going Steady</i>!  And there's still that gleam of greatness
    left in this one.""</p><p>
    
    It was no use.  One by one, the children all started bawling.  A single tear slid down my cheek, too.

A favorite to usurp Nordic comer Iceland-- and easily outpacing the rockist Swedes next door-- 
    Norway boasts an interconnected scene of electronica, improv, and avant-rock that hasn't yet reached our shores except through imports.  That makes Jaga Jazzist's first stateside 
    release, the <i>Animal Chin</i> EP, significant: not only are the band's members tied to dozens of other major Norwegian outfits, they also cram all those strains of music into a single, 
    mind-foggingly dense package.  Imagine if someone replaced all the lamps in your house with strobe lights and neon, and you'll get an idea of the kind of claustrophobic overstimulation 
    Jaga Jazzist instill from minute one of this record.</p><p>
    Jaga Jazzist have been pegged as a state-of-the-art jazz-rock \x93fusiox94 band, a nine-piece (recently upped to ten) that mix conventional jazz instruments-- a horn section, drums, 
    upright bass and guitar-- with layers of tightly-sequenced synths and keyboards, electronic percussion, vibes and marimba.  Yet the band sounds more \x93jazzy\x94 than jazz: with the 
    improvisation confined to closely-managed solos, texture dominates.  Sections will stop or switch on a dime, and every instrument sounds rich, the luscious bass clarinets or 
    Martin Horntveth's drums and electronic percussion scattering like a boxful of precisely-tuned robots. Think of Steely Dan producing a Tortoise album, or imagine a dottier, loopier 
    Stereolab disc while digging the Latin feel to songs like \x93Real Racecars Have Doors\x94, where the band ventures onto a style that comes as naturally to Norwegians, 
    slopping hot salsa on reindeer filets.</p><p>
    But the sound may be familiar to fans of 70s jazz fusion: while none of the soloists are show-offs-- you won't hear a Chick Corea or a John McLaughlin wanking into the spotlight-- the 
    writing shows a fusion-like tendency to use intricate, knotty melodies that are catchy but impossible to hum along with. The arrangements set them apart, from the title track's 
    bright, brassy horn fills and cascading vibes to \x93Low Battery\x94, which has a slower tempo, and even settles from time to time on a simple vamp; \x93Toxic Dart\x94 is jumpier, and shredded underneath 
    with glitches.  While the songs run a concise few minutes per, they're spliced and melted together from multiple sections containing a dozen ideas each.</p><p>
    It's telling that the two remixes-- which suck up half the album-- actually sound far less busy than the original songs.  Martin Horntveth remixes \x93Lithuania\x94 himself and chops up the source, then 
    buries it under an insect swarm of glitchery which effectively steals the show-- and gives us something simpler to focus on.  Meanwhile, the Kim Hiorthøy remix of \x93Going Dowx94 stretches 
    into a sixteen minute collage of found sound and conversations with a (comparatively) simple drumbeat, all built around a loop of just the first couple bars of the original track's melody, played 
    on acoustic guitar.  For its ambition, it's almost boringly simple compared to the rest of the album.</p><p>
<i>Animal Chin</i> is only Jaga Jazzist's first stab at the U. S. market after taking Europe with their Ninja Tune/Smalltown Supersound releases; most of the songs are culled from 
    their two full-lengths and other scattered EPs.  As a sampler for new listeners it could leave you intrigued, or even sated.  Anyone who's already spent too much time listening to fusion 
    may know the kind of ear candy gut-ache it can produce, like chowing down a one-pound bag of Skittles in one sitting: for the overwhelming taste, you'll get plenty of color 
    coming and going.</p></div>"|4195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4195-animal-chin/|7.2|Chris Dahlen

    more than the proverbial carpenter's smile guaranteed the album an airbrushed Stateside reissue, a paper
    baggie, or a strategically applied sticker. Yet Placebo's latest gets away with an unobstructed view of
    female hindquarters, and I think I know why: see, the chick's dead. She's a ghost. You can see <i>right
    through</i> that ass!</p><p>
    
    Sorry, I'm just fascinated by the logic of it.  First, some art director (to be specific, one JB Mondino)
    figures that the title of Placebo's nostalgia-themed <i>Sleeping with Ghosts</i> requires literal
    visualization. He thus blesses us with one of the worst non-metal album covers of all time: a guy in
    artfully torn blue jeans making out with a semi-transparent Photoshopped nude.  Then, U.S. retailers
    greenlight the etude on account of the girl being a specter.  And to complete the circle of idiocy, here
    I am going on about it, instead of briefing you on the album's highs and lows.</p><p>
    
    Fact is, there aren't that many. No peaks, no gorges, just a steady oscillation between adequate and inspired.
    <i>Sleeping with Ghosts</i> is a remarkably level collection of guitar pop, simultaneously less glammy and
    less pungent than Placebo's earlier stuff. It whooshes by on clockwork beats, precision guitarwork (their
    way with the dun-dun-dun-dun downstroke makes Interpol sound like a jam band) and purely decorative bits of
    dissonance.  Yet, if not for some Britishisms and Brian Molko's endearingly bratty whine, this could have
    been Duncan Sheik.</p><p>
    
    The album has two assured rockers (""The Bitter End"" and ""Plasticine""), two not-bad ballads (""I'll Be Yours""
    and ""Centrefolds"") and even a great single called ""This Picture"", where Molko gets to call his departed
    lover ""forbidden snowflake"" and ""angelic fruitcake.""  Which brings us to the genuinely bad news: in these
    days of stunted complacency on both sides of the Atlantic, it's hard to grumble against artists' newfound
    political focus.  It's just that Molko might not be the ideal man for the job.  He is, how you say, not very
    bright.  That's rarely a problem with glam rockers-- leave them in a room with a tome of Faulkner and out
    comes Michael Stipe-- but the eruptions of schoolboy righteousness that dot <i>Sleeping with Ghosts</i> are
    skirting self-parody.</p><p>
    
    The title song, marked by the abundant and irony-free use of the word ""soulmate,"" boasts a couplet worth
    reproducing here in full: ""This one world vision/ Turns us into compromise/ What good's religion/ When it's
    each other we despise?"" Take that, Pope! Globalization and consumerism get a more detailed lashing in
    ""Protect Me From What I Want"", an otherwise perfectly agreeable rave-up in 6/8. When not drilling the
    catchphrase into our brains, Molko dispenses such pearls as, ""Corporate America wakes/ Coffee Republic and
    cakes."" Which is a pity, because the distorted harmonica solo wailing away below this drivel is one of
    Placebo's best musical moments to date. Suddenly, the transparent form on the cover gains a meaning:
    <i>Sleeping with Ghosts</i> invites a conscious separation of form and content. It's dead but pretty but
    dead.</p></div>"|6326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6326-sleeping-with-ghosts/|6.4|Michael Idov

The language seems so naturally loud and boisterous that even
    intimate coos exchanged with my little Fraulein when I visited the country rang in my ears more as Sturm
    und Drang than pillow talk. Fricative whispers came out like menacing hisses, and pleasantries to ""have und
    gute nacht"" became jackbooted commands. That Barbara Morgenstern, by her voice alone, can find a supple
    middle ground that invokes neither a bondage-gear Heidi nor Nico in lederhosen on <i>Nichts Muss</i> speaks
    volumes about her sound sensibilities. She knows when to softly sing in Deutsch, when to slip into something
    a little more English for the internationally catchy choruses, and when to step back from the microphone and
    allow her piano playing to resonate.</p><p>
    
    ""Aus Heiterem Himmel"" pongs and pops with a rattling beat and honeyed vox that has folks like Dntel, Tarwater,
    and Ellen Alien already sticking to it with their recent remixes. Her piano glitches in and out of focus with
    a church organ moving slowly into the foreground. That organ is present again on ""Nichts und Niemand"", alluding
    to yet another bilingual pop group dabbling with technology, Stereolab. Her commanding coo to ""come on, mooove""
    is titillating and utterly convincing, as are the glowing pin-prick ticks of a beat that tickle the ears and
    pulse about her cool piano keys.</p><p>
    
    For a techno-pop record, there are great expanses of the album that are stark and instrumental, warmed nicely
    by two stalwarts in the producers' chairs: Pole's Stefan Betke and Palais Schaumburg co-founder/ex-Orb
    collaborator Thomas Fehlmann. The German equivalent of having King Tubby and Jim O'Rourke manning the consoles,
    the two bring a nuanced clarity to the proceedings that is shockingly moderate and light. Avoiding the dense
    pulse of Fehlmann's microhouse work and the capacious crackles of Betke's more nominally recognized Pole
    persona, the two focus on keeping the beats both wispy and crispy, generally staying with simple percussive
    taps that give Morgenstern's supple voice and piano room to steal softly through the snow.</p><p>
    
    Surrounding the echoed crackle that reflects both <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>'s minimalist plinks and the chilly
    austerity of the ECM back catalog on a track like ""Merci (Dass es Dich Gibt)"", Betke rattles out some metal
    clangs that create sparks against the other elements, a testament to his skills beyond mere dub isolation
    chambers. ""We're All Gonna Fucking Die"" is certainly less dramatic than its title would hint at, but it's
    the most rocking of the set, thanks to the attack of the guitar across the red lights of the beat. The
    dropping in of plucked nylon strings to the flickering rhythms of the title track is the finest merger of
    acoustic and digital since the Spanish flurry of Basement Jaxx's <i>Remedy</i> and funky banjo of fellow
    countrymen The Notwist-- and the track expands to epic proportions when guitar kicks out a wah-wah funk
    lick midway through with some teeny electro ticks.</p><p>
    
    ""Reset"" is the most exquisite of the instrumental set, closing the album with the hiss of analog sizzle and
    an expansive, low-toned hover that takes full advantage of Betke's sound specialization, mixing in with
    gentle guitar figures. That, and the penultimate ""Gute Nacht"", encapsulate many sundry strands of Germany's
    electronic history: the glitch-pop format that Lali Puna and <i>Neon Golden</i> captured in miniature, the

    Divine chomps on a big hunk of dog shit, gleefully. It is a giant train wreck, grand and disgusting and
    compelling, and the pinnacle of 70s raunch. Stockhausen was close, but no cigar: an obese drag queen eating
    dog shit-- now that's pushing some boundaries.</p><p>
    
    But should the stultifying actions of the mondo bizarro elite be resurrected?  Oakland's Gravy Train!!!!
    seems to think so, along with a cache of nu-raunchers from East to West (all sporting hymen-chilling monikers
    such as ""Splitmewideopen"" and ""Fudgie &amp; Fufu""). Gravy Train!!!! pay some kind of homage to their booty-bass
    predecessors J.J. Fad, tingling cowbell clad in pink spandex and lyrics executed with the baby sass of
    ladies eager to self-actualize. And then, like Divine, they desecrate all tangible boundaries of taste,
    demanding, ""Lemme see those titties bounce!"" over teen karaoke keyboards, supersonic cadences getting busy
    with <i>Mad Magazine</i>, and a weird innocence, which isn't easy when you consider this band's status as
    three ass-exposing hooches and a homo.</p><p>
    
    They nasty, though, and they won't let you forget it. On ""Hella Nervous"", which is rapped surprisingly well
    (considering), the homegirl calling herself ""Chunx"" rhymes: ""Suckin' my muff like a vacuum cleaner/ She
    doesn't have the titty/ She doesn't have the ass/ She doesn't have the thick-ass Mexican thighs that I
    poss-ass."" On the instrumental ""Pussy Thrusts (Exercise Demo)"" (trend alert #2: fitness-related dance
    numbers), a beat only slightly less progressive than Parappa the Rapper's driving instruction demo is
    accompanied by instructions for a floor-humping dance move.</p><p>
    
    On the whole, <i>Hello Doctor</i>'s beats and synths operate on Las Vegas time: more is more, 'round the
    clock-- and the band gives it to us in blinding excess, three or four simultaneous melodies often trumped
    only by the absurdity of superfluous and misplaced drum fills. The Gravy Train!!!! M.O. isn't quite clear,
    other than the perpetual reminders that its members are ""filthy little slut[s]"" who ""like to take it in the
    mouth.""  The lyrics tend to be vague assertions of maximum hoochietude, with occasionally funny moments.
    But it's certainly not great music.  Actually, it's more akin to the soundtrack from <i>Dig Dug</i> at a
    minithin-friendly 190 bpm.  But like Divine's glorious shit-eating grin, Gravy Train!!!! are quite the
    raunchy, gaping spectacle; its terribleness is trumped by its incredible disregard for human decency.
    Which makes it kinda funny.</p></div>"|3561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3561-hello-doctor/|2.9|Julianne Shepherd

    bassists, two vocalists, and a rotation of variable instruments. To the human eye, they're a funhouse of
    tiny, screaming singers twitching about with the herky-jerky motion of flipbook animation. They're a D.C.
    five-piece that sounds like ten (or at least moves like that many), and they promote an equally convulsive
    squawking of rhythmic, sometimes experimental and gauzy, dubby post-punk that sits on the same sonic fence
    as Savage Republic and Swell Maps. It's a spectacular, dizzying sight. But how do you properly capture this
    mélange of melodic chaos on disc without its accompanying visual imagery?</p><p>
    Ian MacKaye, producer, opted to turn up the rhythm section, and flatten the vocals for equal footing. You
    know: Fugazi production. It works here, because Black Eyes tend towards similar dub-influenced genetics as
    the aforementioned Dischord patriarchs. It also works because the screeching/harping, high/low vocal
    interchange has major potential to be annoying/overpowering, were the vox any higher in the mix. With these
    production qualities, the band is just comfortably abrasive, snagging against the mix of bent-string guitars
    and strange, trebly percussive clamor. On ""Nine"", there's even a very Fugazi-like drum fade-in, as a wall of
    distorted guitars and warm, insurgent bass pluck out their natty incisions. Particularly great is the bombastic
    disco skronk of ""Speaking in Tongues"", where two shrieking, e.e. cummings-possessed vocalists duke it out in
    a scribbled disconnect: ""Some words if you use them too much lose all meaning/ Enough/ ENOUGH!""</p><p>
    Of course, it wouldn't be a good Dischord band if they didn't provide some sort of higher message, and Black
    Eyes' poetic commentary is particularly well-written. In ""Letter to Raoul Peck"", they sing voraciously,
    ""One-sided politics sell boring records 'cause your vision's too cloudy and our visions are clear."" Sounds
    like a thesis; though their vocals are anxious, the lyrics are delivered in cryptic, personal imagery rather
    than high-strung, broad polemic, and reference poets Langston Hughes and Derek Mahon.</p><p>
    This is the case throughout the record. Racism, queer issues, slavery, and a general sensation of imprisonment
    permeate their words, which are apparently heavily influenced by modern and contemporary black male poets and
    filmmakers. ""A Pack of Wolves"", which excerpts a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa, delves into the psychosexual nature
    of rape, and in this context, perhaps comments on the fratboy element of rap-rock: ""What happens when fuck you
    I won't do what you tell me to/ Means that I will still fuck you/ Even when you tell me not to?"" These lines
    are tossed breathlessly among the friction of uncomfortably skittering bass and clicking beats. It implies
    not only a profound cultural disorder, but refreshes the new kind of creative, full, experimental hardcore.</p></div>"|757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/757-black-eyes/|7.9|Julianne Shepherd

    host of others, including orchestral indie popster Matt Pond PA, so his debut album as Bitter, Bitter Weeks
    comes as a bit of a shock.  The same guy who's spent a career bricking and mortaring walls of sound for
    other musicians, it turns out, has a soft spot for the minimal, getting his strum on with almost no adornment
    over the course of a 35-minute long-player.</p><p>
    
    This can be a perilous path-- stripping a bunch of songs bare and laying them out for the world exposes weak
    writing faster than anything, and too much consistency of texture quickly becomes boring-- but McTear
    demonstrates his engineer's ear with an attention to detail and variation that keeps things rolling pretty
    well.  His songwriting doesn't exactly bring to mind Dylan in the basement, but he's got a knack for a melody,
    and as a lyricist he's certainly got a good internal editor; no cringeworthy stuff here.</p><p>
    
    ""Sage"" kicks off the record abruptly with McTear's multitracked acoustics laying a bed of gothic fingerpicking
    and his distinctive, gritty tenor drawing forth lines about psychological discovery and ""learn[ing] how to
    love without your whole body.""  ""Taking Pills"" adds a subtle steel guitar to the mix for textural variety,
    and several other songs employ such subdued measures to add more body to the music.  ""Daylight Savings Is
    Over"" is contoured by a weird, high-pitched pinging, while McTear's strumming trades in drastic dynamics and
    details, in multitracked harmonies, exhausting walks through dirty streets.</p><p>
    
    The closing pair of ""Still as a Stream"" and ""Water in the Basement"" each employ backing harmonies from cohorts
    including Matt Pond and Mazarin's Quentin Stoltzfus, while organs hum low in the rear of ""Still as a Stream"",
    building on the ancient feel of the guitar work.  ""Water"" has more of a backporch feel, with lazily picked
    banjo and wandering harmonica weaving their way around McTear's steady strumming and powerful voice.</p><p>
    
    The two best songs each resort to the fully unfleshed sound of McTear and his guitar, though each takes a
    markedly different path. ""You Paralyze My Heart"" is sparsely strummed and intensely intoned, with the opening
    line, ""Dear, I just want to say/ You paralyze my heart/ I feel like a thousand trucks all barreling/ Some
    loaded with sparks/ And some with gasoline.""  Meanwhile, ""TN"" is a brisk acoustic pop tune, replete with
    casual ""hey hey hey's.""  McTear outlines the storm and stress of relocating during a relationship, summing
    up his frustration with the lines, ""I wish I could hold my breath/ And it would cure this unrest.""</p><p>
    
    Of course, given that this album is largely a one-man affair, there are moments where the excitement dims a
    bit, but it's remarkable how well McTear does keeping it interesting and engrossing.  It's not going to win
    over anyone who can't stand these kinds of acoustic troubadours, but it'll light a small fire in most anyone
    who's into that sort of thing.</p></div>"|726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/726-bitter-bitter-weeks/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    while an unmotivated go-go dancer swiveled his hips to the jukebox beside him. It didn't matter if it was
    <i>The Price Is Right</i> theme or something by Erasure, he pointed at himself, the jukebox, anyone who
    looked at him, and then the sky.  It was weird, and not nearly as spiritual as I'm making it sound.</p><p>
    
    As go-go boy continued, someone next to me started talking about being really into golden showers, discussing
    the ways in which you could go about asking people to piss on you. At the time I never thought I'd be able
    to use this story of consensual erotic pissing as a lead-in to a record review, but on the warmest day of
    spring thus far, The Hidden Cameras made their way into my compact disc player, and just like that, Grecian
    goldsmiths of hammered gold and gold-enameling were everywhere a-peeing. Honestly, this pack of queer
    Canadians make pissing on your loved one a most holy and glorious of act deserving of its own special
    Hallmark greeting.</p><p>
    
    Named in part after Michel Foucault's take on the panopticon, The Hidden Cameras began as the solo project of
    singer/songwriter Joel Gibb in 2001. Armed with a degree in semiotics and a parade of instruments including
    drum machine, acoustic and electric guitars, glockenspiel, bass, guiro, tambourine, church bells, jaw harp,
    and organ, he recorded a bunch of songs on his four-track and made them available locally on CD-Rs (a few of
    these compositions were released in February 2003 as <i>Ecce Homo</i> on Gibb's Evil Evil label). Now, a
    couple years later, the band members have multiplied like the world's population; Gibb has anywhere from
    three to eleven apostles assisting him in spreading the gospel from town to town.  As a brief aside, I should
    recommend that you check them live, should they arrive locally: they take the stage along with masked go-go
    dancers, films, projected lyrics, cheerleaders, a choir, and all sorts if ribaldry. Folks stomp, slap, spin
    in a rock-opera-cum-passion-play.</p><p>
    
    On <i>The Smell of Our Own</i>, the first LP for the full-membered group, The Hidden Cameras wrap deviancy
    in Polyphonic Spree packaging and AM-pop sheen.  Similar in sound to The Magnetic Fields, The Tall Dwarfs,
    and the more orchestral moments of Belle &amp; Sebastian, the album begins with strings, organ, and a flourish
    of harps and voices. The first track ""Golden Streams"" is road music, some uplifting John Cale sunburst; it's
    also the first of two songs dedicated to piss: ""The golden stone builds the golden road to heaven (held
    up high by golden streams of ice).""</p><p>
    
    The next song, ""Ban Marriage"", approaches matrimony like any good anarchist. It's a jubilant manifesto
    regarding fucking around while also being in love: ""I was late getting to church on the morning of my
    ceremony/ Stayed up too late the night before from fingering foreign dirty holes in the dark."" Gibbs goes
    on to deconstruct ""coupledom,"" and it's here that he makes a point shared by folks who see marriage as a
    bourgeois ideal regardless of sexual orientation; more importantly for the music fan in you, the tune's
    suspiciously similar to Belle &amp; Sebastian's ""The State That I Am In"", a take on tying the knot amid a
    brother's coming out of the closet.</p><p>
    
    On <i>The Smell of Our Own</i>, there are a number of moments for the highlight reel, and only a few plodding
    stinkers. ""A Miracle"" and ""Shame"" are pretty but tepid, and ""Day Is Dawning"" doesn't do much besides repeat
    the song's title. On the more positive side, ""Smells Like Happiness"" has a high-pitched ""The Lion Sleeps
    Tonight"" melody while the crew sings like a pack of Genets buggering away: ""Happiness has a smell I inhale
    like a drug... it is the smell of old cum on the rug."" Equally a triumph of catchy transgression, ""Boys of
    Melody"" sounds like ""I Started a Joke""-era Bee Gees, but here the brothers Gibb are accompanied by strings,
    a choir of angels, and stained bedsheets.</p><p>
    
    Ahh, Spring! And springs! Though Gibb is completely obvious about the pleasure of fucking other guys, the
    sex goes beyond man-on-man action to that of <i>any</i> people enjoying fucking other people, just always
    ecstatically. The album's closer, ""The Man That I Am with My Man"", is initially about a couple's sexual
    ministrations, but by song's end, it's more about a communal eroticism: the multitudes act as brothers in
    bed, pronouns slip, and I imagine the whole world fucking. With an open approach to queer sexuality and
    radical politics, <i>The Smell of Our Own</i> offers an alternative to the saccharine teen spirit we're so
    used to sniffing. It's a sensual celebration of stinky, real-life sexuality.</p></div>"|3853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3853-the-smell-of-our-own/|8.1|Brandon Stosuy

    other dancepunk bands, with its post-punk residue guitar and futurist façade held up by a rickety beam of
    80s synths.  In 2001, it sounded great ideas, unearthing what were once rival influences-- disco and punk--
    and ushering them into a new era to co-exist as an indestructible art force you could finally dance to.
    And credit is due, of course, as they were among the progenitors of the genre.  But the fact remains that,
    just two years later, it's become undiscernible from the pack.</p><p>
    So maybe there's something energizing about distance. For their second full-length, <i>MNML</i>, core members
    Bob Doto, Daneil Mazone, and Julian Grefe (also of The Trans Megetti) sent each other tracks via post, writing
    long-distance songs from their homes in Boulder, Providence, and Philly, respectively. Long-distance relationships
    are nearly impossible to maintain, and long-distance bands echo the statistics: I'm guessing the survival
    and/or success ratio of these bands to be around 1 in 50.  For the rest, the mail-order romance end in
    monotonous over-simplicity or blinding disconnect.  But magically, <i>MNML</i> clicks in all the right,
    punky discotheque places, and it's love American style.</p><p>
    S Process' rhythm section sends the dancepunk idiom flailing like a jackknifed truck of bricks. Where other
    low-slung hipsters bark angrily atop cold hi-hat beats, this trio softens any pointed angles with a smart
    emotionalism. Heavily rhythmic, electronic-smattered dance-pop numbers are the name of the game-- and when
    the instrumentals are short on arty hooks, the vocals are long on lilting melodies. It's a wise and balanced
    move, and it sends S Process just across the threshold into their own vista of elaborately composed tracks,
    sparkling with guitar, drums, programmed electronics, even actual pianos.</p><p>
    Also, possibly thanks to producer Phil Ek, the rhythm section sounds hotter, fatter, and more driven than
    those of their counterparts, Rick Mitchell's basslines burning across the record with a fireball intensity.
    Sure, they're no Gang of Four, and their vocals don't sit stiffly at 90-degree angles. It's more like a
    fuzzy 45, bent and melting; more Craig Wedren than Indra Dunis.</p><p>
    The band opts to reference Boy George before exposing its damaged goods.  On <i>MNML</i>'s best track, ""I'm
    a Cement Mixer/I Heart You"", vocalist Bob Doto chirps either ""Karma Karma Karma Chameleon"" or ""Come on, come
    on chameleon""; either way, it's executed with the enthusiasm and timbre of Lee Ranaldo's ""Hey Joni"" treatise,
    as decorated by a trembling orchestra of road-burning guitars and hi-hats sharp enough to cut through glass.</p><p>
    And best of all, S Process never abandon their subtle combination of club-hot bass and warm, emotionally
    fertile vocals vice-versa. Even in the seething, rigid ""Spring Garden Drive-By"", in which Mazone sings,
    ""Function or fashion/ Fashion or fuck you... Six-finger Rick is the sickest boy in Providence!"" has a
    certain fiery-passionate twang about it, among its clipped beats and thumping bass breakdowns, leaving you
    to pray this is one long-distance relationship with staying power.</p></div>"|7757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7757-mnml/|8.3|Julianne Shepherd

    ushered to the front of the stage; still long on passion and short on technique, it's the Bangs.  It's a
    familiar call and response, and every static chord or fossilized scream of empowerment proves it isn't the
    call that's changed, it's the reply: from the solidarity of ""Who's with me?"" to something more like ""Who
    cares?""  Unfocused, ""spirited"" energy has gotten feminist rock exactly nowhere since the long-gone days of
    Bikini Kill, and the Bangs are determined to remain part of the problem.  Shouting works when no one's
    listening, but as soon as you've got people's attention, you'd better have something to say.  Kathleen
    Hanna, Sleater-Kinney, and a more enlightened few already know that, but the Bangs-- runners-up in this
    feminist sweepstakes-- have yet to catch on.</p><p>
    
    All that's left, evidently, is to ride the horse that brought or birthed them, pounding on the instruments
    until candy comes out, hacking the same ground in the ongoing saga for a Strong Female Rock-and-Role-Model.
    If there's one genre that fears change, it's plodding, monolithic power-punk, a mode the Bangs have down
    pat: from the opening grind of the title cut, it's clear they don't aspire to anything more than the
    riot-grrl hand-as-dealt.  Maybe it runs in the family-- bassist Maggie Vail is after all the sister of
    former Bikini-Killer Tobi Vail-- or maybe they'd argue that there's merit to rehashing already well-hashed
    (and admittedly unresolved) problems in traditional fashion, playing loud, confrontational, hard-firing
    punk.</p><p>
    
    If the latter is the case, I respectfully disagree: if ""We got art to make/ We got shit to learn,"" is Sarah
    Utter's cry (on ""New Scars""), why recycle artless, ham-fisted three-chord progressions as your backing track?
    There's got to be an underlying anger to pull off lines like, ""It's years of names and disrespect/ I won't
    shut up anymore""; drive can only take you so far before a dynamic shift is needed to sell the pitch.  The
    blistering,  arpeggiated buzz that contributes to ""Leave It Behind"", the bubblegum balladry of the unfortunately
    shallow ""Kinda Good"", and the less-is-more, sing-song breakdown on <i>Call and Response</i>'s title track
    evidence at least some effort at creativity, but basically, the Bangs deliver their message exactly as you'd
    expect them to, chaining old songs to even older dances, all but ensuring these tunes are relegated to
    also-rans in a genre that, for the vast majority, was left by the wayside when it ran out of fuel.</p><p>
    
    Having to sit through this obvious repackaging of legitimate concerns-- old ideas that in light of their
    derivative second-generation, continue to be relevant-- is like listening to highlights from someone's trip
    to Agony.  Lots of listeners have yet to get a headache from beating their heads on the punk rock, demanding
    no more than the status quo, and in the Bangs' defense there's still urgency to feminist issues in music and
    the world at large.  These girls are still getting the message out the only way they know how, but even to
    that end-- as meaning with a melody (of sorts)-- the Bangs aren't cutting it.</p></div>"|545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/545-call-and-response/|3.8|Eric Carr

    generous salmon steak, it was just dripping with juices natural and unnatural. Finally, someone got it together to play lounge electronica with a live band, I thought. The drummer
    had some real weight behind him, not to mention the lilt and swank to wear it with pride. The bassist and guitarist were credible musicians; on the whole, the record had a pleasingly
    large and consuming sound the first time through.</p><p>
    But you cax92t eat the same steak twice, and that goes double when you're dealing with white fish. I learned the hard way when I pilfered a friend's copy of <i>Our Aim Is To Satisfy</i>--
    the thickness was there just as I remembered it, but now it seemed slimy, oppressive, even abusive, covered in a thin film of its own aggressive self-impotence. Loop-happier than
    bottom-of-the-crate trance, but with an itchier sound-byte finger than the dustiest display-doomed house mix, this was no wellspring of musical ideas. Once in a while my head would
    start to nod, but the sheer repetitiveness lulled me to sleep before I could start tapping my foot. I woke up sweaty and paranoid, feeling violated. Gentleman, this is the kind of music you might get slapped for playing when you have a girl over. Ladies, it constitutes just cause.</p><p>
    This latest self-titled album, on the other hand, is a totally different beast. It has no pretense of inertia, no shot at mediocrity, and in a just world, no chance of being
    back-ordered by even one pitiful Red Snapper completist. My ancestors have a word for this kind of artifact: dreck. Terseness not being one of my virtues, I see it as a
    pyramid of candle-thin pins just waiting to be toppled in slow motion by the spit-shined ebony sphere of my naked wit. This disc was made for trashing, readers, and I
    will do so with gusto, in an attempt to win back the dim sense of self-respect that the previous release has so thoroughly shattered in me. For the sake of concision, a
    poem inspired by the tracklisting:</p><p>
<i>One is pretty messy, two is none too quick;<br/>
    Three is housy-bouncy, and four is much too slick.<br/>
    Five goes on forever, six is just dead weight;<br/>
    Sevex92s name is \x93Odd Man Out\x94 but sucks as much as eight.<br/>
    Nine is a nice live track, but dox92t listen to ten.<br/>
    I'd rather die a gruesome death than hear this shit again.</i></p><p>
    It's hard to say what's so offensive about the new album.  In a way it's kind of like the difficulty victims of sexual assault have admitting that it wasx92t their fault-- if the problem was beyond
    your control, how can you ensure that it doesx92t happen again? There is ultimately nothing to distract you from the fact that these people have succeeded in doing with live instruments what
    even the most styrofoam DJ cannot: make dance music that appeals entirely to the dark side of the human spirit. I would be surprised if passive manipulation, sexual withdrawal, stony
    silence and possibly looting dox92t follow in the wake of this album. So if you have any say in the matter, I suggest seeking out a few minutes of old Red Snapper to inoculate you, and then
    staying the hell away. Just look what it did to me.</p></div>"|6722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6722-red-snapper/|2.8|Jascha Hoffman

    vu.  No, seriously, I've got a real glitch-in-the-matrix thing going on here; I feel like I've been here
    before, reviewing this CD before, in this exact manner.  Hmmm, Fruit Bats... I think Bowers once told me
    they were ""pleasant-is-the-new-subversive,"" but just who knows what that bent lunatic is ever on about?</p><p>
    Well, let's run through the checklist on opening track, ""Rainbow Sign"".  You got your folky-picked acoustic
    guitar riff, check.  Your twangy, even though the singer is not from the South, vocals, check.  By the end
    of the song the coffeehouse strumming is overtaken by plunky vibraphone and digitized percussion, check.
    So good have I gotten at this game, I can hide the liner notes, put on my pyramid hat, and figure out that
    Sub Pop is on the contract and Brian Deck is on the switches, giving the proceedings that Sleepy Hollow
    sound he specializes in.</p><p>
    Wait a second, Sleepy Hollow, hollow, Holopaw!  <i>Mouthfuls</i> is so similar to the eponymous release from
    this band's Gainesville-based label-cousins, they're harder to tell apart than Mary Kate and Ashley.
    Indie-folk with a slight taste for what some cultures would consider experimental (keyboards, machines, and
    the like), Fruit Bats sound like they've been cheating over Holopaw's shoulder on SAT day, right down to a
    lyrical obsession with Niagara Falls (Canada-side, I'm assuming).  All of which you'd know I consider to be
    a considerably good thing, if you've been a good Forker and printed out my Holopaw review for your nightstand.</p><p>
    Batman Eric Johnson has got a good ear for a classic melody, has overcome his fear of occasionally
    sounding like the Grateful Dead, and is willing to let Deck toss in enough gizmos to keep songs like ""A Bit
    of Wind"" (backwards guitars, horns) and ""Track Rabbits"" (mellotron, outer space ""La""-ing) from getting too
    evening-dull.  Coming off their nostalgia-high debut, <i>Echolocation</i>, Fruit Bats seem to be further
    embracing modernity and sounding great doing it, even getting a little E6-poppy on ""Magic Hour"", which sounds
    like Beulah after laying off the horn section, or ""Union Blanket"", Olivia Tremor Control on an overdub diet,
    plus a hip-slap beat.</p><p>
    And yet the rerun feeling pervades the entire album; admittedly unfair given that even our shiny new global
    economy could not allow Fruit Bats to rip off Holopaw <em>this</em> quickly.  And besides, Fruit Bats even beat
    Holopaw to the punch; <i>Echolocation</i> was also produced by Deck, way back in 2000.  In fact, it could be
    said that Holopaw actually stole their show from <i>these</i> guys, if a person was so inclined to make those
    kinds of assumptions.  The question is: if I'd heard <i>Mouthfuls</i> before hearing Holopaw's record, would
    it have scored the 8 instead?  And I think I can safely say ""no"" to that, since the Fruit Bats are lacking
    in their labelmates' sense of when to get out of a song-- too much of this record's second half celebrates
    meandering, like the interminable ""Lazy Eye"" and the two-line-mantra ""Slipping Through the Sensors"".</p><p>
    Still, never have I been able to make a stronger RIYL about a band, and many flaunters of plaid shirts would
    appreciate the delicate girl-harmonies and banjo of ""Seaweed"" or slow-motion environmentalism of ""The
    Little Acorn"".  I'm certainly not saying I don't want to drink a glass of red wine to it, but let purveyors
    of this musical brand take note that it's starting to bleed together in the wash.  If this post-folk stuff
    doesn't watch out, <i>A Mighty Wind II</i> is gonna end up featuring Parker Posey as a relocated Southern
    gal who's too drunk to finish a song live and a thinly-veiled Tweedy figure portrayed by Fred Willard.</p></div>"|3228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3228-mouthfuls/|7.1|Rob Mitchum

    performing clinical click/cut operations as either Ø or Philus, Mika Vainio has spent his time accumulating
    a curious catalog of sounds on the Touch imprint, be they of the curatorial art gallery background sort or
    the more frontal lobe-frying, barbed sinewaves sort.</p><p>
    His fourth solo disc finds a kind of strange theme: sailors. Here he is, all dolled-up like a siren with a
    wig and fishnets, waylaying freshly shaved skippers on shore leave with a beguiling sound that's part
    good-time laughter, part throat gurgling, and part cheap-liquor retching, before he stoves their heads 20
    seconds in with a savage blast of broken glass, roars, and machinations. If those Yankee recruits could
    only have read Finnish, they'd have known that the title ""Revi Täällä, Merimies"" actually translates to
    ""Sunder Here, Sailor"".</p><p>
    ""It Is Existing"" breathes some back-alley gases through the lungs, seeping out an air of greasy haze over a
    slimy puddle underfoot. Once that clears up, Vainio turns his prey down a dark passage, chloroforming them
    again until all you can hear is their drugged, staggering heartbeats and the swaying neon of the red-light
    district. Coming to from the stupor, the sailors find themselves stripped clean, clanging against some oil
    barrels as they try to hide out on an opaque dock in a strange port town.</p><p>
    ""He Was a Sound Sometimes"" drones pleasantly the first two minutes, before the record ends and a needle
    starts to slowly drag across the label, pulling the ears back down while gathering up dust as it loops
    itself.  Vainio finally gets around to replacing it with a rare record of steamer engines, all surface
    noise and menacing hiss. Floating still on that boat, he wraps a scratchy wool pea coat tighter around the
    head before a tea kettle in the captain's quarters reaches a roiling boil, evaporating all that came before
    it.</p><p>
    The blissful peak comes at the center of the record. ""Colour of Plants"" uses a gentle harmonium-hum as the
    starting strand of a relaxing sort of sea cruise, while Vainio assuredly gathers a gravity about it,
    stretching its salty breadth to encompass all available space, at the same time retaining its hypnotic
    state, the colors of the open sea glowing a ghostly blue iridescence that carries through the more
    land-locked tracks ""Streets"" and two-thirds of ""Motel"".</p><p>
    But that's where the nightmares begin. Forgoing the nautical imaginings for the seedier side of noir, the
    end of ""Motel"" seethes with a menacing series of squeals before segueing into the drunken lurch of ""Snowblind"",
    which is just blottoed enough to hear the ozone gathering over the flickering TV static, all of it turning
    into an acid-reflux of hot mash, making the by-the-hour room spin and strobe. ""Further, Higher!"" finds us
    by the seaside for a split second, hearing the crashing waves before a low drum hit drops us back into the
    dank galley darkness, where the shanghaied sailors sleep. Small orchestral flames slowly cast a glow over
    the claustrophobic space, just catching the glint of a blade before it chops the disc to an end.</p><p>
    More frequently than not, Vainio serves up a disarming fluctuation between the extremes of ambience and
    power noise, even changing horses midstream in the track if the mood takes him. A fine bodily hijacking
    that's neither too mellow nor too harsh.</p></div>"|8391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8391-in-the-land-of-the-blind-the-one-eyed-is-king/|7.7|Andy Beta

    <i>Don't Want To Know You</i>'s disintegrated beats, granular chunks of synthesizer and minimal drum programming, thrown out at the listener like a hot and stinky
    middle finger. Sodahberk must be listening to <i>Home Invasion</i> in his bedroom, though; the clanking hip-hop breaks and squelching bass that show up in the
    mix definitely belies the abrasive ethos of cuts like \x93Lagre (Long Play)\x94 or the white noise antisocialism that \x93Jax94 and the Oval-minded \x93Bunk Debris\x94-- originally
    on Sodahberk's <i>a-noi-a</i> CD-R-- subscribe to. The attitude is a front, and when Sodahberk puts himself out there, when he tries to mix with the gyrating sheep,
    he does his absolute best to please.</p><p>
    If you hollowed out his brain and filled the cavity with sand, Daren Emerson might be swayed to work <i>Don't Want To Know You</i> into his next Global Underground
    mix; there's a whole colony of X-ed out party anthems to be found on the record, bound together by mathematically precise beats that nonetheless sit on fairly shaky terrain. The
    hypnotic shuffle of \x93Swichd Weg\x94 is crusted over with static and radio waste, plodding along with elephantine dedication toward the DJ booth. \x93Is OK\x94 is the epitome
    of this approach, a tribal house behemoth that doesn't lose the static interference, but drops a short chiming melody in the mix that can't be resisted. At all times,
    the sound is channeled through steel wool and fiberglass, shredded to microscopic bits, and it is to Sodahberk's credit that the tracks still retain their gritty thump.</p><p>
    The hip-hop genes in effect are less pure, more akin to the abused structures of Plaid or the harsh dynamics of Techno Animal; the latter's <i>Brotherhood of the Bomb</i> LP
    is prime inspiration for \x93What I Can Do If You Don't Listex94, with its mountainous kicks and metallic frequencies, as well as the subterranean bassline that
    oozes its way into the core of \x93Participateur\x94, surrounded by drum loops that crumble under the woofer's mammoth weight. Smoother beats can be found on \x93Walk
    Me To The Corner\x94 and in the textured layers of the dancier \x93Devoiced\x94-- both with boom-bap backpacker kits-- or the slower tempos and rewound synth washes of
    the last cut, \x93Formerly\x94. They work equally well, separating the intentionally abrasive tracks from those that are able to retain their misanthropic attitude, while
    shamelessly reaching out for your ears.</p><p>
    Dwayne even tries to win us over with a miserable warts-and-all acoustic ballad, but  \x93Fuck You I'm Untouchable\x94 is a case being uncomfortably honest on the
    first date-- after all, it wasn't to long ago that our good buddy was carving \x93Fuck you, Fascist!\x94 on the principal's desk and starting fights with anyone in a sweater-vest.
    All is forgotten after <i>Don't Want To Know You</i>: the kids sit a little closer at lunch, wait for him outside of school in the morning. He's unwashed, but loved.</p></div>"|7309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7309-dont-want-to-know-you/|6.8|Mark Martelli

Some improvise,
    emphasizing interaction between players in a manner approximating jazz.  Some focus on specific rock signifiers
    and exaggerate certain aspects. And then some go off to a more impressionistic place, manipulating texture
    and mood as if composing a score for a film. Cul de Sac is a restless, searching band that reimagines itself
    for each new project, so it's no surprise that they've dabbled in all these at one time or another.</p><p>
    
    Here in 2003, with their new record <i>Death of the Sun</i>, Cul de Sac is firmly entrenched in the impressionistic
    mood-based sphere.  This record finds them adding two new members-- John LeMaster on bass and violin and Jake
    Trussell on turntables and electronics-- and along with the sounds brought by them, guitarist and leader
    Glenn Jones is more freely experimenting; his hand spends about as much time on a mouse as it does a fretboard.
    In large part due to Jones' shifting interests, <i>Death of the Sun</i> is very much a product of the studio:
    old 78s are sampled and looped, odd drones that sound anything but live creep in and out, field recordings
    form the structural backbone.  I'm sure they have a solid plan for taking this music on the road, but
    <i>Death of the Sun</i> doesn't sound like something made by getting four or five people together in a room.
    It sounds labored over, thought through, and pieced together very carefully.</p><p>
    
    In addition to the electronic experimentation, the album is also very much a drummer's album, and Jonathan
    Proudman's consistently rich and nuanced playing could be described as the lead instrument. ""Bellevue Bridge""
    is a track that started with a field recording Glen Jones made underneath a bridge near his hometown, and
    though the eerie sounds of cars passing overhead and water rippling below are intact, the percussion is
    what's most evocative. Alternating blocky mallet hits with shimmering cymbal washes, Proudman effectively
    conveys the menace and wonder one feels when visiting a strange childhood haunt. ""Turok, Son of Stone"" is
    even more percussion-heavy, with Proudman's tribal floor-tom patterns functioning somewhere on the level of
    Mickey Hart's score to <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, signaling the approach of something deadly. The moaning,
    wordless sound of a woman's voice ups the tension further.</p><p>
    
    The best songs on <i>Death of the Sun</i> are the ones that are built around Cul de Sac's new interest in
    samples. ""Dust of Butterflies"" is assembled around a loop of an ancient 78 recording of a tune called ""Creole
    Love Call"", a haunting clump of sound that's difficult to place but whose emotional content is clear. The
    apparition of the sample's central riff, when doubled with a parallel violin line played by LeMaster, works
    against Jones' plucked nylon string guitar, bits of glitchy static, and Trussel's Melodica. ""Bamboo Rockets,
    Half Lost in Nothingness"" is mostly a feature for Jones' electric sitar work, but as he spins out a buzzing
    melody the sound of South American rainforest recordings flicker past, fixing the sound of the music in
    space.</p><p>
    
    The closing ""I Remember Nothing More"" is the capper, a breathtaking piece built from a sample of an old Cajun
    78, with a ghost of a woman's voice singing ""Salangadou"" along with Cul de Sac on guitar, bass and drums.
    There's an interesting story about how Glen Jones came across the record, but the liner notes tell it well
    enough. Suffice to say that Cul de Sac have built a stunning track around the woman singing from the crackly
    slab of shellac.  Cul de Sac went out on a limb a bit with <i>Death of the Sun</i>, venturing into unfamiliar
    sampled-based electronic territory, where tracks are layered gradually over time. It could have been embarrassing.
    Instead, they've made one of their finest records.</p></div>"|1685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1685-death-of-the-sun/|7.9|Mark Richardson

    deluged in a movement all but kept secret on my own New York streets for over twenty years. The cherry on top is finally being able to hear this archival release of the Theoretical
    Girls, a band whose moniker treaded close to becoming an apt description of their turbid presence in the history books of the late 70s downtown scene. Hypothetically, what would a band
    featuring hundred guitar orchestrator Glenn Branca, visual artist Margaret De Wys, Sonic Youth producer/engineer Wharton Tiers, and theatre/dance composer Jeffrey Lohn sound like were
    they still in their mid-twenties, when the city was still up for grabs and there were many aspects of rock that had yet to be turned by their forefathers the Ramones, Television, Talking Heads,
    and the others?</p><p>
    Surprisingly, they sound a lot more rock'n roll than their contemporary art credentials would lead you to surmise. And while the Glenn Branca reissue on Atavistic
    focused only on his singing contributions and the more avant leanings of the Girls, this set of songs descries the styling of Jeffrey Lohn, the more straightforward side of the group.  Their
    theme song starts the disc off at full gallop, taking the thundering count-off numbers of the Ramones and stretching them to the limit, concentrating less on ideas and more on the mad tempo
    blast, straining to stay within the chords even as Tiers' drums thump relentlessly. \x93Computer Dating\x94 foresees the advent of Nerve.com, and the faceless frenzy of the New York City hook-up
    infects every note of the song like a chancrous outbreak.</p><p>
    Perhaps their closest contemporary at the time would be the Step Forward-era Fall, matching their raw rock non-production with the profuse, sneering verbiage of \x93Europe Max94, as
    well as embodying the lean, gleeful bounce from a few choice rhythmic elements, becoming the latter act's modus all the way through its Brix-era pop sensibilities. The unrefined
    keyboards of De Wys serve as link not only to the similarly primitive bleeps of pre-Eno Devo, but all the way through the spasmings of another Ohio group, Brainiac, nearly twenty years later.
    On \x93Lovin in the Red\x94 her orgax92s throbs act as contrary motion to the rest of the band, speeding and slowing defiant to the rhythms of the spiky guitar riffs of Branca and Lohn.</p><p>
    The only track ever to see Carter-era light-- as the A-side of their lone single-- \x93U.S. Millie\x94 runs together inane pop culture references to Howard Johnson hotel chains, Jews for Jesus pamphlets,
    yogurt health, and Scientology at a <i>Taxi Driver</i> pace, contorting the marquee barrage of Times Square through Lohx92s catchy derisions and setting up the 3-card monte stand for
    Thurston Moore's street hustles circa <i>Sister</i>-era Sonic Youth. Equally powerful is the frustrated garage rage of \x93No More Sex\x94, grunting and steaming like the nastiest of '77 punk.
    \x93Electronic Angie\x94 howls secret constellations of blackened bubblegum on subway platforms, illuminating the preordained patterns of sidewalk cracks and black tar asphalt.
    Real street gospel.</p><p>
    Some of Lohx92s experiments, like \x93Keyboard Etude\x94 and \x93Polytonal"", are too short and unformed to be effective, especially in light of Branca's buzzing behemoths. \x93Parlez-vous Francais\x94 works
    despite their tendencies to shout lyrics in French, but even as redundant tracks appear on the second half of the disc, songs like \x93Theoretical Girls\x94, \x93Electronic Angie\x94 and \x93Chicita Bonita\x94 are
    high voltage and variegated enough to warrant revising those old No Wave maps, which right now only include DNA, Mars, Teenage Jesus, and the Contortions.</p></div>"|7987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7987-theoretical-girls/|7.5|Andy Beta

For all the shit the D has
    taken over the years, it seems to be integrally representative of certain American trends through the ages, be it the mass exodus of the middle class to the suburbs, the collapse of
    industry and associated decay of the labor movement, or the cost-cutting decline of the once-proud Tigers (where have you gone, Chet Lemon?).  Musically speaking it's been no less
    important, from Motown's rise paralleling the civil rights movement to the futuristic idealism amidst crumbling factories paradox intrinsic to techno.</p><p>
    
    Now we find ourselves in third age of Detroit musical prominence, and depending on what kind of righteous mood you're in, the success of the White Stripes, Kid Rock, and Eminem is
    either an honoring or a pillaging of the city's black culture.  Evidence for the latter is provided by the fact that the above notables, Eminem and his celluloid-dramatized trailer park (soon to
    be a thrill ride at Universal Studios) excepted, originate from the expansive Detroit suburbs, the endpoint of that 70s pale-face migration.  If you're the kind to grant weight to back-story
    authenticity, there's little in the strip-mall continuum of Novi and Rochester to justify either blues-rock wailing or hip-hop indignation.  So if there's one thing you can grant Pas/Cal-- natives
    of the burbs that would rather consider themselves satellites of highbrow Ann Arbor than empty Detroit-- it's that they aren't denying their identity.  If we're embracing our mental tendencies to
    pigeonhole, the quartet is purveyors of that most whitest sound: slightly fey indie-pop.</p><p>
    
    The boys of Pas/Cal don't want to be Robert Johnson or Run DMC, they want to be Stuart Murdoch, as their rumpled preppie wardrobe on the cover and the literary fonts suggest.  Unashamed of
    their Brian Wilson fandom, they obligingly title the opening song on <i>The Handbag Memoirs</i> ""The Bronze Beached Boys"", and possibly naming themselves for mathematician Blaise Pascal
    doesn't do much to reduce their nerdy image.  But like the Detroit suburbs themselves-- which could be swapped with commuter towns anywhere in the US without anyone noticing-- Pas/Cal's
    indie-pop never makes an impression deeper than any nice, pleasant, derivative music.  The first half of this six-song EP-- each track bearing painfully bookish names like ""I Wanna
    Take You Out in Your Holiday Sweater""-- is full of capable sunny-day soundtracking with occasional quirks, like the brass breakdown of ""I'd Bet My Life That You Bet Your Life.""  However,
    nothing suggests that these dapper dandies are anything more than big fans of Carl Newman's pre-Pornographers days in Zumpano.</p><p>
    
    With a downward slide over the last half unloading the undercooked ""Grown Men Go Go"", the lost-without-a-map instrumental ""Marion/Miriam"" and the Beatles-by-numbers ""This Ain't
    For Everyone"", Pas/Cal can't sustain an EP shorter than a sitcom, suggesting a less-than-rosy career prognosis.  It says something that their biggest
    attribute is their predictable, familiar character, and it bears mentioning that they don't even do the suburb-jam with as much energy as some of their regional compatriots
    (if I might name-drop for a second, I hereby plug The Little Band That Could've, the Red Shirt Brigade).  It all begs the question of what's worse: staying within demographical
    lines and coming off dull, or donning the cloaks of cultural carpetbaggers to reap occasional rewards.  In either case you're being sold second-hand goods, and although
    their selection is limited, the tributary Pas/Cal are at least up front about where they got them.</p></div>"|6188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6188-the-handbag-memoirs/|5.8|Rob Mitchum

    Promise is sprinkled like birdseed throughout <i>Great Aviaries</i>, Super Numeri's blinding menagerie of instrumentation, which grounds itself in post-rock and percussive
    jazz. Each track presents a new twist on its predecessor, adding elements with bold confidence and at a patient, comfortable pace. Sitars, Victorian music boxes, and Doors-inspired
    organ all find their way into Super Numeri's tour van, which is already packing the legacy of Ninja Tune acts such as Cinematic Orchestra and Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra (whose complex
    instrumentals often offered respite from the labels highly evolved trip-jazz mission statement).</p><p>
    The live band feel is inescapable, as electronics and studio trickery become window dressing for the tight interplay of the group. \x93The Ember Love\x94 and \x93Classic British Ponds\x94 easily build a
    bridge over the troubled waters between post-rock and cloying jam bands, fortifying their extended meanderings with a thick bottom end that ensures the noodling doesx92t overcome the beat.
    \x93Classic British Ponds\x94 swells as the percussion reaches a treacherous climax, then breaks over the simple bassline, which pulses into \x93Flaurent Carmix94, a hypnotic, echo-laden slice of
    warped funk that sounds like Osibisa fronted by Roger Waters, all in the throws of a dedicated hydrocodone binge.</p><p>
    \x93Sundial\x94 carries the afro-beat torch as well, but allows it to roam wild and
    attack the speaker cabinets with bursts of shrieking guitar and squawking brass, sounding like the Philly Zoo during mating season, and the sloppy stop-start dust that \x93Beaks\x94 kicks up is a
    natural follow up. You could almost get away with saying it rocks, but you'd get laughed at for sure; a gentle trip like \x93Otter's Poll\x94-- draped with groggy harp and violin-- is a lot more Andrew
    Coleman than Andrew W.K.: the guitars get crazy, sure, but they never get up to 11.</p><p>
    The strings that find their way into the commotion as bookends to \x93Sundial\x94 are stunning, and their presence on <i>Great Aviaries</i> resonates deeply. Super Numeri's Ninja Tune bio, credited to their
    landlord, makes much of the orchestral elements in effect on the album, and rightfully so. They are the cool satin sheets that the afternoon rehearsal funk of \x93The Ember Love\x94 rests on, the
    tranquil stream that winds through the wet summer air of the album's opener and first single, \x93The Electric Horse Gardex94, an impressive number that could easily sit beside Coldplay or
    Phish's quietest moments without breaking a Liverpudlian sweat. Used sparingly, the strings never overwhelm, content instead to simply bring a touch of majesty to the party. It's a seamless
    integration.</p><p>
    With only eight songs on offer, <i>Great Aviaries</i> seems insufficient, sticking to a lower weight class when it could easily be taking on the big boys. Most of the pieces stand by their established modes
    for the duration, with little variation in mood or energy. You can be certain Super Numeri have some chops, and equally sure that their debut is holding something back. But they make up for their
    brevity with a number of excellent refurbishings of the Ninja Tune sound, pulling the soul of the samurai into their tea-shaded rock unit and working it ragged. If there's a safe bet in the newest
    Ninja generation, Super Numeri are it.</p></div>"|7613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7613-great-aviaries/|7.4|Mark Martelli

    Beulah's sappy harmonies, he or she might end up with something closely approximating Lab Partners,
    Dayton's answer to the age old question, ""Where's the dreampop?""  The results of this hybridization have
    been documented as <i>Daystar</i>, an exhaustingly comprehensive case-study on the effects produced through
    blending a core structure of blissful shoegazing with just enough poppy bounce to make said shoes tap every
    now and again.  On paper, it's a fascinating theory, but in practice it can't help but yield a little less
    than the sum of its parts; maybe someone should double-check the formula.</p><p>
    
    In isolated instances, Lab Partners seem to have a brilliant grasp on the delicate science of crafting
    fuzzy drones for mopey kids, but brightening things up enough to keep people watching the skies instead of
    the floors.  The preliminary results are decidedly positive.  The sweet acoustic refrains and 60s pop
    harmonies of ""Gold"" are a strange and effective mixture of upbeat and bittersweet, and its jangly chords
    merge with the massive feedback theatrics that made space-rock famous on ""Those Things"".  Beautifully
    strangled notes gasp for air through waves of feedback while the vocals glide just over top, clean and
    clear.  It's lush, flowery music that easily lends itself to such lush, flowery description, and the early
    tests are a real success; however, in just two tracks, Lab Partners also inadvertently showcase the
    entire width and breadth of their powers.</p><p>
    
    Like all good students of the scientific method, Lab Partners realize that these trials need to be performed
    again and again, to ensure the veracity of their output.  That's when the trouble begins; the group sticks
    to a fairly rigid equation-- open small, build big, lather, rinse, and repeat-- and they rarely appear to
    be comfortable working outside of it.  They mimic Galaxie 500 not only in sound, but in sheer constancy as
    well; the link is so omnipresent that for a few brief moments during the opening of ""After Hours"" I would
    have sworn up and down that I was listening to ""Strange"".  Fortunately, overt comparisons aside, such
    heavy-handed influence peddling is rare; Lab Partners have seen farther because they usually just stand on
    the shoulders of giants, not because they've ripped them off.</p><p>
    
    Still, by the time the album passes the 50-minute mark (and you realize there are still twenty more waiting
    in the wings), the sense of predictability becomes stifling.  Occasionally, some outlying data crops up; the
    brief wall-of-psych on ""Riptide"", the minimalist echoes of ""Waves Keep Falling"", or even the blues-tinted,
    hard rock crunch of ""Magnify"" all fall out of step to mixed effect, but they're the exception to the rule.
    The bulk of Lab Partners' work seems content to reproduce prior effort, creating what feels like an abundance
    of filler.  One sprawling, ten-minute epic falls well within standard tolerances (""Still Shine On""-- the
    title says it all); the second is just a more sensitive remix.  It's hard to fault these guys for giving
    more than necessary, and as the padding on <i>Daystar</i> goes, it's relatively strong.  Still, when Lab
    Partners begin to outdo themselves at the same songs on the same album, you'd be well advised to cut their
    funding.</p></div>"|4615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4615-daystar/|6.4|Eric Carr

Where are the hover-cars and space colonies we
    were promised in 50s and 60s Futurist films and literature?  Are TiVo and bagless vacuum cleaners the best
    we have to show for two centuries of industrial revolution?  I dare say, reality has been greatly shown up
    by the imaginations of people who wrote and directed fifty years ago.</p><p>
    
    We do have ways to access the future of the past today, though: Disney's Epcot Center is a huge, overpriced
    monument to unrealized technological ambition; goofball ""future music"" recordings by the likes of Perrey &amp;
    Kingsley and Peter Thomas have been made available on compact disc (with modern mastering technology revealing
    limitations in the source tape, no less); and every utopian and cautionary sci-fi movie ever made is out on
    DVD, whether or not it deserves to be.  We even have modern acts like Stereolab and The Swirlies, who insist
    that the future of the past actually did arrive, with their analog soundtracks to space station lounge scenes
    and meetings in edgeless, woodless buildings with minimal decor.</p><p>
    
    The Swirlies weren't always so bent on retro-futurism, but the obsession was always present, whether as an
    undercurrent.  With <i>Cats of the Wild, Volume Two</i>, however, the band members throw themselves into
    straight-up homage, despite that the lounge craze it would have sounded so tight in hung up its smoking
    jacket for good almost ten years ago.</p><p>
<i>Cats of the Wild, Volume Two</i> (there is no Volume One) is kind of The Swirlies' seventh album-- though
    it's actually more like a seven-song EP with 20 minutes of aimless noise tacked on at the end-- and it
    perfectly embodies the old vision of what the turn of the 21st Century was supposed to look like.  The
    record swims in squiggling electronic noise and quasi-futuristic noisemaking, but like a string holding up
    an Ed Wood spaceship, its noisy, lo-fi sheen gives away its present-day creation.</p><p>
    
    For all their playful experimentalism, The Swirlies remain, to this day, essentially a shoegazer band that
    strayed into a European electronics boutique.  Longtime Swirly Damon Tutunjian keeps the lead mic to himself
    on each of these songs, but Swirlies old and new pop up all over the record to lend support; the liners list
    (almost illegibly) a total of 15 members playing on the album.  That's a lot of Swirlies, and sometimes,
    it's apparent that too many cooks were crammed in the kitchen at once, as the instrumental clutter is often
    overwhelming.</p><p>
    
    You still get some old-style blasts of Swirly goodness, though.  That's Seana Carmody lending her fetching
    croon to the background of opener ""One Light Flashing I Love You"", the track's bright synth melodies floating
    above the overdriven beats and messy guitar parts like an olive in a martini, and sloppy guitar parts grinding
    against the facade while Tutunjian's faux-British accent strives to rise above it all.  ""Le Bag"" is a slinky
    noir thriller strewn with percussive clutter and clean guitar chords bent in half by tremolo bars.  And
    ""Sleepytime"" kills its melody with blasts of horrendous, tuneless distortion, yet somehow comes out all the
    better for it, despite bordering on being a bit overlong.</p><p>
    
    Even with some choice moments, though, it's difficult to say that <i>Cats of the Wild</i> is really worth it
    for anyone but a true Swirlies devotee.  And, of course, even they won't likely be listening to that aforementioned,
    ridiculously unnecessary (if aptly titled) 20-minute closer ""Cats of the Wild Forever"".  13 years into their
    indie rock career, The Swirlies still haven't topped their second full-length, 1993's fantastic <i>Blonder
    Tongue Audio Baton</i>.  So maybe the future of the past doesn't look so great after all.  If you need to
    reminisce on what might have been, there are better retro-future documents out there than this one.</p></div>"|7674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7674-cats-of-the-wild-vol-2/|6.0|Joe Tangari

    P-Funk mob rise to freaky fame and fortune in the mid-70s was less the
    result of cosmic slop than a long, hard road of bad deals and slim payoffs
    made only through relentless persistence.  Clinton had been going at it with
    his doo-wop quartet The Parliaments since 1955, when he formed the vocal
    group to play school dances and rec center hops.  He released his first
    single in 1958 (it bombed), and auditioned for Berry Gordy's Motown in 1962--
    they didn't get signed.  Clinton's one lucky break came when Gordy's wife
    hired him as a staff songwriter, and even then he was sacked when the Gordy
    pair split up.  However, by the time of Clinton's unfortunate release, The
    Jackson 5 and Diana Ross recorded a couple of his songs, and he was able to
    produce some sessions for other artists in Detroit.</p><p>
    
    By the mid-60s, during the day, Clinton was working at a barbershop, and
    going to Detroit on the weekends to gig with The Parliaments (by that point,
    adding a rhythm section).  In the summer of 1967, the band released the
    single ""(I Wanna) Testify"" on Revilot, and it was their first hit: #20 Pop,
    #3 R&amp;B.;  ""Testify"" allowed them to quit their day jobs, and the group were
    soon headlining The Apollo Theater, and touring with rock acts like The
    Amboy Dukes and Mitch Ryder.  But during the late 60s, Clinton had a falling
    out with the Revilot big-wigs, and the result was him dropping out of his
    recording contract and losing the rights to The Parliaments' name.  Thus,
    the Funkadelic moniker was born, and in 1968, Clinton even flirted with the
    idea of his own label.  At the same time, most of the band was experimenting
    with LSD, and was fascinated by psychedelic music (in particular, Clinton
    has heaped major praise on <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>).  From that point, marking
    their 1968 signing to Detroit's Westbound Records, they would never again
    be seen as a straightforward R&amp;B; band-- and certainly not as the modest
    doo-wop outfit first begun by Clinton more than a decade earlier.</p><p>
    
    Fast-forward a few years to 1974: Funkadelic had established a modest
    fanbase in the R&amp;B; community, and even a small cult of rock listeners.
    Their 1971 masterpiece <i>Maggot Brain</i> had brought to fruition everything
    promised by Jimi Hendrix in the 60s, and is still seen as one of the major
    releases of the decade.  That said, Funkadelic was never a pop band, and
    when Clinton got the rights to The Parliaments' name back, he made a
    concerted effort to make that band (rechristened Parliament) a better fit
    for a wider audience.  <i>Up for the Down Stroke</i> was the band's first LP
    after their rebirth (on the newly created Casablanca imprint, also home to
    Kiss, and later one of the most prominent disco labels), and was the dawn
    of a new sound for Clinton's band.  Gone were guitar solo freakouts and
    reverb-drenched biological speculation.  The new groove called for tighter
    arrangements and shorter tunes-- though hardly at the expense of the funk.
    In fact, Parliament's 70s records redefined funk music forever more, from
    mere party music to ""Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication.""  Brothers and
    sisters, make way for the bomb.</p><p>
    
    The title track from the 1974 record was the best example of the new
    Parliament sound: mid-tempo, hard disco-funk beat with tight horn charts
    (most likely played by Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker and the Horny Horns,
    though none have ever been credited) and a tight, super-addictive vocal
    arrangement.  Furthermore, new bassist William ""Bootsy"" Collins' massively
    elastic, muddified lines almost single-handedly made this stuff sound
    completely different than even concurrent Funkadelic releases like <i>Let's
    Take It to the Stage</i>.  The writing trio of Clinton, Collins and keyboardist
    Bernie Worrell were responsible for most of P-Funk's greatest jams of the
    mid-to-late 70s, and <i>Up for the Down Stroke</i> was their invitation to the
    world to join the movement.</p><p>
    
    Several old Parliaments remakes made their way onto the disc: the slinky
    version of ""(I Wanna) Testify"" distances itself from the original with
    big-footed drums, Worrell's sly clavinet, and disco horns.  ""All Your Goodies
    Are Gone"" gets hazy vocal harmonies, late night, blues-y piano and some very
    tight drumming by the legendary Tiki Fullwood.  The band had already been
    playing this tune for a few years on the road with Funkadelic, and along
    with the incredible, gospel-tinged ""Whatever Makes My Baby Feel Good""
    (featuring Eddie Hazel's always acidic guitar) are songs that could well
    have appeared on Funkadelic LPs from the previous couple of years.  If <i>Up
    for the Down Stroke</i> saw the band still clinging to the established P-Funk
    sound just a tad, the next two releases would make a b-line for the new stuff.</p><p>
    
    1975's <i>Chocolate City</i> (a tribute to Washington D.C., where Funkadelic
    had enjoyed their greatest popularity since the early 70s) wasted no time in
    presenting the new-sound Parliament.  The title track is the first instance
    of what would be many classic extended tracks with narration: ""They still
    call it the White House, but that's a temporary condition""; ""To each his
    reach, and if I don't cop, it ain't mine to have, but I'll be reachin' for
    ya, because I love ya, C.C.""; ""What's happenin', black?""; ""GAMIN' ON YA!""
    All this set to a simmering, pulsating track peppered with Maceo's (again
    uncredited) sax and Worrell's reckless piano and synth lines.  ""Ride On""
    busts out of the gate with a ridiculously massive Bootsy bassline and patented
    Parliament group singing.  This tune may be the baddest jam on the record,
    and that's saying something when the engorged funk of ""Together"" and party
    anthem ""Big Footin'"" share space on its tracklist.</p><p>
    
    ""I Misjudged You"" is Parliament's finest ballad, and sounds like a tribute
    to old-time vocal bands like the Chi-Lites, with the obvious exception of
    the general queasiness of the groove.  Clinton bathes the mix in reverb and
    the beat is pure Fullwood grease.  Even with ""sha-la-la-la's"" and a Muzak
    string arrangement the track can't escape its destiny as an herb-fueled,
    escapist torch song.  Where the band falters is when it gives up groove
    altogether, as on the tedious ""Let Me Be"", with only Worrell's symphony of
    synthesizers, piano and some impassioned emoting that basically says ""leave
    me the fuck alone"".  Of course, it's hard to find a lot of faults with a
    record so consistently on the verge of something huge.  But then, the best
    was yet to come.</p><p>
    
    Clinton urges listeners not to adjust their sets, and that he's taken
    control of the show-- you'll get your life back as soon as you're groovy.
    In other words, as soon as <i>Mothership Connection</i> has been in your
    life for approximately three seconds.  In one fell swoop, Parliament's 1976
    LP made good on every too-long vamp and nonsensical narration they'd ever
    dropped.  The title track is the fruition of <i>Chocolate City</i>'s ambition
    to mass cultural freakiness: Clinton's narration gives you the sci-fi backstory,
    but this time there's a message (""make my funk the P-Funk, I want my funk funked
    up"") and it's backed up by a #1 jam.  When the band joins in on the first chorus,
    they will the cosmos into alignment, and all unfunky peoples of the world into
    instant 3-D submission.</p><p>
<i>Mothership Connection</i> was a massive R&amp;B; hit and even produced a pop
    hit in ""Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)"".  Parliament was
    nabbing major crossover exposure, but their status as sci-fi R&amp;B; superstars
    was practically unmatched at the time.  The title track offers one of the
    classic P-Funk refrains-- ""Swing low, sweet chariot, and let me ride""-- and
    the weirdly religious undertones in the music were reflected in the cultish
    image of the band and the feverish scenes of their concerts from the time.
    Clinton's obsession with concept (and somehow using the same musicians to
    make records for a dozen labels) would soon get the best of his quality
    control, but on <i>Mothership Connection</i>, all of the out-there shit
    came together.</p><p>
    
    These three LPs detail the blueprint for pretty much every Clinton project
    henceforth, and though there are still some hot spots left (most notably
    1977's <i>Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo System</i>), Parliament never really
    got better.  The reissues are remastered, and include some (mostly
    inconsequential) bonus tracks, so if you were curious about the band before,
    now's your time to investigate.   Those of you already on the train, next
    stop is C.C. so get your handcuffs ready: these jams won't get stepped on.</p></div>"|6175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6175-up-for-the-down-stroke-chocolate-city-and-mothership-connection/|8.3|Dominique Leone

    into a psychedelic fit regarding those anemic shoegazing soul-searchers in
    Longwave.  Though I was previously unable to ascertain exactly why this
    band is being hailed as ""visionary"" (amongst other hyperbolic nonsense) in
    the greater music press, or even what the band seems to be aiming for on a
    just being-a-band level, the hackneyed early Radiohead/U2 pseudo stylings
    of Longwave became less hermetically locked to me in this state. I got it.
    I got <i>them</i>. It was an unexpected revelation. I was momentarily able
    to look past Longwave's soporific dullness-- and my own ensuing boredom and
    anger regarding the band's meteoric rise to mediocrity-- to figure out why
    they needed to exist in 2003.</p><p>
    
    Before I returned to reality, the blissful effects of the cardamom took me
    to Brandon, age 14, when I, a clueless skater with Flock-of-Seagulls hair,
    proudly brought an Ocean Blue cassette into school and showed it off to my
    comparative history teacher who was really into The Smiths. The following
    week-- barely time enough to absorb their powerful work!-- I couldn't
    understand why he thought they were so slight. Fuck me! Even as he explained
    his response by analyzing their weak lyrics, derivative sound, and cultural
    plundering in relation to Morrissey and his jangly guitar-toting sidekick, I
    thought, ""He just doesn't get it, the old goat."" In that frame of mind,
    Longwave rule.  But more importantly: Longwave are The Ocean Blue for our
    new dark age.</p><p>
    
    Longwave formed in 1999, ostensibly to carry a pale, whimpering torch for men
    with Brooklyn perms the world over.  They even boast two ex-residents of
    Rochester-- Mike James, the wiry haired drummer, and Steve Schlitz, a singing
    valedictorian who opens his eyes and mouth as wide as Billie Joe as he belts out
    banalities (""Tidalwave"" actually sounds like Green Day's ""Good Riddance [Time of
    Your Life]"")-- performing a stiff simulation of rocking out in the mannequin-heavy
    video for ""Everywhere You Turn"". The most interesting thing about Longwave is
    that two of their members grew up working in the factories of Kodak, that great
    manufacturer of images.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, <i>The Strangest Things</i> isn't their first album. After listening
    to it seven or eight times I guessed it was some kind of studio invention to cash
    in on the aesthetic numbness of the rock revival, but shockingly, such anesthetic
    college rock actually emerges from people with day jobs, too.  It's like you're a
    young artist growing up away from the evils of the city and instinctively you make
    a series of advertisements for Absolut Vodka. I guess it happens?  Longwave's first
    album, <i>Endsongs</i>, came out in 2000 on Luna Sea Records, an imprint started by
    the owner of New York City's Luna Lounge. There was also an EP, <i>Day Sleeper</i>,
    on Fenway, a self-released EP, and a bunch of RCA-related singles. Both <i>Day
    Sleeper</i> and the new album were recorded by Dave Fridmann at Tarbox Road Studio,
    who, despite helping to mold the sounds of The Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev in the
    not-so-distant past, is slipping a bit these days, working with artless hacks like
    Ed Harcourt and Phantom Planet, presumably in the name of easy cheddar.</p><p>
    
    I've tried my best not to judge Longwave on their connections to The Strokes.  After
    all, it does make sense that if you tour with a band, they might help you secure a
    record deal. What's more troubling is that a posse of four with about the same rock
    'n' roll power as The Dave Matthews Band could get passed off as even <i>kind of</i>
    important in some pretty major, supposedly insightful music publications (<i>CMJ</i>
    has lost all remaining credibility-- as if it had much left, I guess-- by awarding
    <i>The Strangest Things</i> album of the day. That's right: of the day. Sigh).</p><p>
    
    Okay, the music. There was a moment during my first year at college that I ran
    into a bunch of people heavily into My Bloody Valentine, Lush, Ride, Slowdive,
    Swervedriver, and other bands in stripped Gap t-shirts who fell into the general
    Shoegazing genre: mostly pasty English (or Anglophilic) guys and girls with bowl
    haircuts playing dreamy, droning feedback, singing whispery in the background.
    Musically, that's Longwave, though their vocals are mixed in a much higher, more
    radio-accessible style that reveals every flaw of the vague, melodramatic lyrics.</p><p>
    
    The cascading guitars of ""Wake Me When It's Over"" plod into the single, ""Everywhere
    You Turn"", which is admittedly catchy, but sounds eerily similar to Mr. Mister's
    equally catchy diptych of ""Broken Wings"" and ""Kyrie"". It's destined to be a favorite
    at weddings everywhere. Even grandma kicks it, asking you if it's a Strokes B-side,
    as she gets drunk on table wine.</p><p>
    
    Longwave's lyrics remind you that valedictorians are sometimes just booksmart.
    ""Exit"" boasts an image that might've shown up in Ethan Hawke's deliriously bad
    first novel <i>The Hottest State</i>: ""Little thing/ What are you going to do?/
    I'm drawn into your big black pool/ It comes in waves, it comes in waves/ And the
    waves could pull me in.""  The icier ""Meet Me at the Bottom"", also obsessed with
    orifices, finds Schlitz ""slipping through your every crack."" Yikes?</p><p>
    
    Though cardamom hits fast (like an atom bomb!), the high doesn't last. When I
    jumped out of bed in the morning, reaching for my notebook, I was chagrined to
    realize that I hadn't written down a single thing during those spice-induced
    moments of clarity. Man oh man, doubly screwed! Not only was I embarrassed that
    a standard cooking spice took me on a strange Christmas Carol trip to my past,
    now I no longer understood the need for Longwave. I guess, really, I just always
    felt comfortable in my thinking that one Toad The Wet Sprocket was more than

Everyone has their own reasons for this, 
    but personally, I find it refreshing because none of it's my problem: I don't know why birds sing in the morning, or why a flock of flamingos know to turn around at the exact same time.  If cats are 
    fighting in an alley, or a couple of squirrels are chasing each other in pre-coital scurrying, it's not my problem.  While every noise in nature connects to some fact or motive, to 
    an outsider it's just meaningless activity, and it can fade into a peaceful buzzing.</p><p>
    What's ultimately so pleasing about the sound of Thuja's latest record is the way that they emulate nature, both in the sound-- a wide-open, lo-fi shape, what you'd expect if you recorded 
    a hike in the woods with a ten-dollar Dictaphone-- and in their performance, which like all their work is completely improvised.  While their first two records approached the open feel of 
    these recordings, neither of them follows the concept so rigidly as <i>Suns</i>; where their earlier pieces often picked up clear rhythms or patterns, everything here is fluid.</p><p>                        
    Thuja stick unwaveringly to one tone, even to the point of blocking themselves.  Free improvisation is often expected to take on a life of its own-- the interactions between players cause tension, 
    creating drama, or in some other way producing spikes and arcs-- but Thuja often avoids engagement.  Players will interact and then swiftly unlock for fear of getting each other worked up, and 
    in these moments, any intensity swiftly dissolves.  To generalize, sound sculptor Loren Chasse and pianist and keyboardist Rob Reger take the more environmental roles: the sampled 
    noises of bird songs or unexplained thrashing, and the sheer size of the production play major parts in every piece, if for no other reason than because they make the recognizable 
    instruments sound small and even incidental.  That includes Reger, who fixes drones with sustained tones, and Steven R. Smith and Glenn Donaldson, who pluck and clang across the top.</p><p> 
    I won't try to identify all the instruments and percussion on this record, since even the normal plucking of stringed instruments (like the steady line on track five) can sound bizarre.  The variety 
    of noises-- a radio frequency hum, a quick percussion loop, the extreme garbled noises on track eight-- make the album sound mysterious.  If you didn't look it up, you wouldn't even know 
    how many people are on this record, but it's mainly the way they taped it that makes it feel so sprawling and unpredictable.  Like a field recording, you get the sense that even when you 
    stumble upon a conventional piece of music, the person holding the tape recorder could just wander off to check out something else.  Take the different sections of track five, for example: 
    the break halfway through sounds like someone just hit the \x93pause\x94 button, and we have no idea why.</p><p> 
    If I had to sum up the experience of listening to this record in one word, it would probably be \x93arbitrary\x94; like nature, it has its reasons and we don't need to know.  Thuja 
    stick to their tactics unrelentingly, and sustain interest with an album that seemingly has nothing human to communicate: no clear motivations, no shifts in mood, and 
    ultimately, no information, just an endless stream of activity that's pleasing for its own sake.  This is not, therefore, a record that you'll really love, or that'll hold your 
    attention from end-to-end; you might like to look at a bunch of trees, but how often you do remember any one of them?  That intangibility doesn't make this any less refreshing, however-- its 
    faceless ambience is nearly as soothing as total silence.</p></div>"|8049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8049-suns/|7.1|Chris Dahlen

The Moldy Peaches, a mere album and single into a dubious career, have just
    released a 55-track double-CD compilation of-- and I'm loathe to repeat this-- ""unreleased cutz and live jamz.""
    In terms of business guile, it's the equivalent of the plushie outfits Kimya Dawson and Adam Green insist on 
    wearing onstage: childish yet disturbing, and so monumentally idiotic that I find myself disarmed. Making fun 
    of this album would require all the daring of a Christopher Guest mockumentary, but I'll try to avoid fish-in-a-barrel potshots.</p><p>
    
    The bounty is unevenly divided into two CDs arranged in roughly chronological order, and some of these cutz are 
    actually coverz, of the Grateful Dead, Spin Doctors and Hulk Hogan. Most originals show up twice, first as studio demos, 
    then in live form.   ""Steak for Chicken"", with its manifesto rhyme ""Who mistook the steak for chicken/  Who am I gonna stick
    my dick in,"" is a triple offender, but I suppose you could compare the 2001 and 2002 concert versions to
    track the band's growing familiarity with open chords.  You know what?  So much for the poker face-- give me that Glock;
    you're going down, Gilly.</p><p>
    
    The barrel, it needs to be said, is even smaller than the fish: this is the so-called Antifolk scene, largely
    confined to NYC's Sidewalk Cafe and sprung from the mind of a man named Lach, who does their booking. He
    gets a soundbite here-- anyone who makes it to track 20 of Disc 1 is treated to ""Lach's Intro""-- and Sidewalk 
    provides the setting for some of the live stuff.  The entire scene is a bit of a sham; Antifolk is nothing more 
    than an infantile fringe of acoustic punk-- imagine if the Violent Femmes' development halted at age 9 and not 13, 
    and you get the picture. If Adam, Kimya and pals actually pitched their songcraft as a Bronx-cheer rebuttal to granola 
    musings of Dar Williams and Lucy Kaplansky, things would quickly become interesting. But I'm afraid ""Bunny Foo Foo"" 
    and ""Who's Got the Crack"" are not going to cut it. Folk deserves a better nemesis.</p><p>
    
    As absurd as the mini-cult around the Moldy Peaches is (this album is your comeuppance, suckers), fuming at
    them is probably even more pointless. At their occasionally glimpsed best, the Peaches radiate a
    stunted, abused-kid vulnerability that makes one feel almost protective. Of course, if that's a put-on, they're 
    evil geniuses after all.  In fact, someone should investigate these guys, dropping a debut CD with the song 
    ""NYC's Like A Graveyard"" on the second Tuesday in September 2001. It's wiser, however, to sentence these kids to 
    time served: novelty acts that blow up to play Central Park Summerstage are usually fair game, but people
    who played it in lion suits in 95-degree weather have punished themselves enough.</p></div>"|5381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5381-moldy-peaches-2000-unreleased-cutz-and-live-jamz/|1.9|Michael Idov

    meddling grups at the INS.  You see, for some reason, they're under the
    impression that just because you weren't born here, you shouldn't have the
    right to DJ and record slick-ass odes to urban nightlife and the thrill of
    getting naked on the dancefloor.  I think I heard she got married to an
    American guy, but even so, Immigration wouldn't let her travel for a couple
    of years, and jetset downtempo electro loses a lot when you remove the
    jetset part.  So now, she has this CD that she can't really promote, which
    you're not likely to hear unless you go to the right NYC clubs.  Tough break,
    huh?</p><p>
    Dinky's stuff is well within your range if you're in any way enamored of
    (almost too) mellow electronic-pop, comfortably nudged somewhere between
    Boards of Canada, Röyksopp and the soundtrack to an 80s softcore Cinemax
    flick.  She samples Madonna, but comes off like Björk on downers; she looks
    like one of the girls in the ""Addicted to Love"" video, but her beats are
    imported direct from <i>Computer World</i>; she calls it <i>Black Cabaret</i>,
    but it's obviously gray slink.  It's a party record that never attempts to
    hide its melancholia, or else it's a bored record that can't cover up its
    casual air of sex.</p><p>
    And sex does seem like an integral part of this record.  Where you might
    think the output of one of NYC's up-and-coming DJ stars would be filled
    with dashing, trendy electro or some mutated, American form of garage or
    two-step, Dinky's stuff doesn't really even seem suited as much for dancing
    as it does for foreplay, and beyond.  In a perfectly delegated world, she
    might be doing soundtracks for high-class porn, and have you bobbing your
    head while watching heads bob.  ""Berlin Nights"" uses its vintage Korg DDD-1
    drum track, subtly placed underneath two or three layers of synthesizer
    watercolor, and loops blond ambition to create the perfect Autobahn cruising
    track, to be played only when your top three buttons are undone, and the
    gin's dried up.  This music sounds best when you want to be played.</p><p>
    ""Mami"" lopes along with considerably less bravado.  Where many of the other
    beats are straight-up showroom dummy precision, this one swings a tad on the
    loose side.  Dinky colors the loop with congas and occasional deep bass, and
    the downward spiraling melody fragments that seem to pop up all over the
    record lend it genuine tenderness, which might also be interpreted as
    nostalgic emoting by anyone expecting fireworks.  She never really delivers
    fireworks, per se-- the most active stuff is the low-key future funk of
    ""Frogz"", or the silly take on fast-food Americana, ""American Guy""-- but,
    unlike recent Björk, <i>Black Cabaret</i> is generally able to keep smooth
    eccentricity from veering into boundless mush (perhaps the Icelandic diva
    could take some pointers on minimalism here).</p><p>
    Of course, if you're not prepared for a comedown, then you might pass this
    record up entirely.  In a way, this music relies on the listener already
    having danced the night away, and assumes you're ready to fall into lethargic
    bliss.  Dinky certainly knows how to lather up a room of slow-motion players,
    and if you can stand a bit of sensuality at the expense of outright grinding,
    <i>Black Cabaret</i> satisfies.</p></div>"|2321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2321-black-cabaret/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    don't let the breakthrough success of The White Stripes lead to a blues revival.  Now, old blues I can
    handle, even if it doesn't particularly do it for me-- I file classic blues fanaticism alongside bisexuality
    and sportscars in the ""things I'll never understand, but cautiously respect"" column-- but the phenomenon of
    nu-blues, embodied by the likes of The Soledad Brothers, is an evil worse than hair metal.</p><p>
    The thing is, The White Stripes themselves are accessories to this crime: The Soledad Brothers are known
    affiliates of the White syndicate.  While the blues might be just as much of a conceptual jumping off
    point for Jack &amp; Meg as their peppermint clothes (\xA9DiCrescenzo, 2003), it's their deviations from the
    strict blues formula that bought them walk-in humidors, like the fuzzy Buzzcocks emulation of ""Fell in
    Love with a Girl"" (\xA9Ott, 2002).  The Stripes might show proper reverence for the titans of the genre,
    but it's funny how their true ancestral excitement always seems to bleed through on covers of decidedly
    non-blues names like Dylan, Parton, and Bacharach, while ""Ball and Biscuit"" remains the lamest dog on
    <i>Elephant</i>.</p><p>
    Soledad Brothers, as shown by their creatively titled live album <i>Live</i>, have never broken free of the
    strict adherence to the equation Rules = Authenticity = Good.  With a singer/guitarist who has-- again,
    creatively-- named himself Johnnie Walker, the trio rarely deviates from the twelve-bar script or the
    riff-trance blueprint.  From this <em>Toledo</em>-based group's opening ""aight, y'all"", it's clear that
    Soledad Brothers are more than happy to hijack the Southern culture they've read about in books to cover
    up their suburban upbringing.</p><p>
    From the one-chord-and-harmonica rumble of ""Stand Up""-- sounding like ""I Want Candy"" with even worse lyrics
    (""Stand up!  Stand up!"")-- to the hey-I-can-play-with-a-beer-bottle slide of ""Break Em' On Down"", it's clear
    this band have zero to add to the blues vocabulary: they're subtracting.  ""Walker"" can't get enough of
    putting himself in rustic-gospel scenarios (""Johnny's Death Letter""), but his thin voice has none of the
    character necessary to pull off this grizzled act, instead coming off like karaoke George Thorogood.  Sure,
    in a live setting the band is able to get a sweatier sound than they've so far tapped in studio, but it's
    not enough, leaving me and the ten people present the night they recorded the album cold.</p><p>
    Later, it's made clear by ""Teenage Heart Attack"" that the Soledad Brothers first heard blues the same way
    all us crackers did: 'cause the Rolling Stones used to play it.  ""Teenage Heart Attack"" swipes the Stones'
    taste for S&amp;M; lyrics and a couple riffs from <i>Exile on Main Street</i>, but with a limp tone and lacking
    that Jaggerian caterwaul, it comes out sounding like those British ""greats"" Deep Purple.  When they reach
    their grubby hands further back to a cover of ""Goin' Back to Memphis"", they only sound more ridiculous, the
    refrain ""well, I'm going back to Memphis on Highway 61"" failing to obscure the fact that, nowadays, they'd
    be taking I-57.</p><p>
    ""Up Jumped the Devil"" may finally be able to sustain a certain level of gritty swagger, but even the lamest
    bar bands strike gold on occasion.  And these days, when there's pedestrian saloon blues for cheap-- from
    sterilized Memphis, to Goofy's Blooze Shack in Disneyworld-- I see no reason to release this mediocrity on
    a national level.  Jack White endorsement or no, Soledad Brothers are just the home version of that shitty
    band you're trying to ignore down at the local dive, and pumping through your stereo speakers, there's
    not even $1 PBRs to take the edge off.</p></div>"|7321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7321-live/|2.8|Rob Mitchum

    It's top, innit?\x94); touch typing instructional records snuggle up against Hancock and Wonder, lean lazily on acapella 12-inches by Salt x92 Peppa and the soundtrack to <i>Willy Wonka</i>. There is
    no limit to the unexpected juxtapositions to be found in the dollar bin of basement record shops, a sprawling garden of fresh and waxy ingredients. Ringwear be damned.</p><p>
    Hexstatic seem to understand this. Usually the A/V specialists of Ninja Tune's Muppet-jazz empire, <i>Listen and Learn</i> is their contribution to the <i>Solid Steel</i> mix series, an excursion that is
    equal parts label sampler/primer and crate-digger's purging session. Pitting their taste for relaxed electronica against vintage vinyl cuts and oft-sampled breaks, Hexstatic are at their most
    playful and least inhibited, a throwback to the energetic days of <i>Funkjazzical Tricknology</i> and DJ Food's <i>Jazz Brakes</i> series. Everything gets thrown on the wheels of steel (and in some
    cases, the CD mixer), licked and glued to the forehead of Ike and Tina Turner's \x93Funky Mule\x94, stapled to the spacey buttocks of \x93Aquarius\x94 by Boards of Canada (one of their best); the
    interludes are crammed so full of sound bites-- Charlie Brown, Queen, <i>Rock the House</i>-era Will Smith, Twisted Sister and <i>Boogie Nights</i> in the space of 45 seconds on
    \x93Solid Steel Rock School\x94-- it's like a vinyl trainspotter's lonely wet dream, a perpetual flea market of sound.</p><p>
    The mood is sedate and chilled throughout.  Only occasionally do Hexstatic break a sweat and drop an up-tempo beat like the accelerated funk and bass edit of \x93Mr. Scruff's Ninja
    Tune Megamix\x94 that crops up early on, sneaking it into bed with a tasty loop of Dawn Penx92s \x93No No No\x94 before the mix settles into its creamy funk midsection. It's a nice exhibition of restraint,
    adding just enough adrenaline (and porno samples, natch) to keep things moving smoothly. This contrast brings out the hazy sunshine in slow burners such as \x93Easy Thing To Do\x94, an
    indelible vocal track by Shirley Bassey that unravels sweetly until the scratch-fest \x93Daily Intake\x94 steals the ball and runs with it into the old school hip-hop end zone, post-partying to Young MC's
    \x93Know How\x94.</p><p>
<i>Listen and Learn</i> never really falters or hits a rough spot, although the inclusion of \x93The Message\x94 suggests a lack of inspiration, a predictable choice that nevertheless melds well with its
    freewheeling lead-in, the very alliterative \x93Solid Steel Scratch School\x94 interlude. But it's not a mix to remember either, more a tasty party snack than anything else, delicious and cheesy and
    without much resonance. Hexstatic probably wox92t stress on this point too much; their game plan is to get the asses shaking, the drunks jumpix92, the feet tapping. If the CD could put a
    lampshade on its head and grab your girlfriend's ass, it probably would: they're aiming for a thinking max92s spring break essential, and they achieve that with <i>Listen and Learn</i>.</p></div>"|3845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3845-listen-learn/|6.8|Mark Martelli

Resting on the roots
    of legendary Kiwi punks Enemy, The Clean debuted in 1978, and were instantly something of an oddity in their
    homeland, where the rock scene was dominated by bands covering American and British music.  The Clean played
    only their own songs, and helped nurture a Kiwi scene that's accrued probably the best per capita ratio of
    great bands of any country in the world.</p><p>
    
    Contrary to popular legend, The Clean's debut single ""Tally Ho"" wasn't the first release on the Flying Nun
    label (that honor goes to The Pin Group's ""Columbia"" single), but it was the release that changed music in
    New Zealand forever: with next to no resources behind it-- and coming off a recording budget of just $60
    NZ-- the song landed in the New Zealand Top 20.  By all rights, ""Tally Ho"" is a classic of immense
    proportions, from its Velcro melody, absurdly mixed garage organ and motorik beat, to the crusty, hiss-laden
    home eight-track recording that embodies it.</p><p>
    
    From these gloriously humble beginnings, The Clean never
    pursued convention; they didn't even record a full-length until after reuniting in 1989, following a
    several-year hiatus.  Even today, the band is intentionally an on-again/off-again concern for its constituent
    members Sir David Kilgour, Hamish Kilgour and Robert Scott, who each have numerous, constantly active projects.
    The Clean's personal, personnel and collaborative connections infest the New Zealand scene, including The
    Bats, The Great Unwashed, Bailter Space, The Chills, and The Gordons.</p><p>
    
    For their years without a full-length, the band sprinkled a healthy sampling of EPs and seven-inches across
    their initial phase, and the first disc of this compilation focuses on that pre-break-up period.  Aside from
    the roots of many a New Zealand band, you can also hear the seeds of Yo La Tengo (who have covered the band
    countless times, and also guested on their last album, <i>Getaway</i>), and various lo-fi factions of American
    indie rock.  The bulk of their most widely praised release, the generically titled <i>Compilation</i>, is
    represented here, along with various scatterings from sundry singles, flexi-discs and live EPs, all arranged
    in something resembling chronological order.</p><p>
    
    ""Thumbs Off"" is a brilliant blast of fuzz and amateurish harmony with a strong kinship to the Television
    Personalities, while ""Billy Two"" has whiffs of England's Swell Maps about it, and ""On Again/Off Again""
    improbably nods to The Fall with its jumpy acoustic guitar and declamatory vocals; how much contact The
    Clean had with these bands is hard to say, but those comparisons should read as nothing but compliments.
    Resemblances aside, Disc One is stuffed with an embarrassment of riches, from organ-marinated pop gems like
    ""Whatever I Do, It's Right"" to pre-Clinic instrumentals ""At the Bottom"" and ""Scrap Music"", to say nothing of
    ""Point That Thing Somewhere Else"", a ragged-edged surf-punk gem containing one of David Kilgour's best guitar
    parts, a droning whir of delay and fuzz that hangs in the corners of the song like fluttering cobwebs in a
    breezy room.</p><p>
    
    The band's early days are left behind for the higher-fi post-reunion output on Disc Two, which features
    tracks from <i>Vehicle</i>, <i>Modern Rock</i>, and <i>Unknown Country</i>, as well as four incredibly rare
    songs pulled off of a US-only seven-inch and a flexi included with <i>Modern Rock</i>'s early pressings.
    The band didn't alter their sound so much as expand it in the 90s, deepening the production and, of course,
    focusing on albums for the first time.  While these recordings are generally less revered, there's plenty
    to rival the immediacy of classics like ""The Fish"" and ""Slug Song"": the second disc is just as strong as
    the first.</p><p>
    
    The seven tracks from <i>Vehicle</i> sound confident, and show the band coming back together in fine form,
    with all three members taking vocal turns and pulling in experience from their various other bands.  ""Drawing
    to a Hole"" kicks things off with a huge wall of jangle and everyman vocals built to infect your brain, and
    David Kilgour's guitar puts on pounds everywhere, spilling leads and chaotic scrawl all over every song in
    a joyous celebration of rock and roll noise.  ""Diamond Shine"" is uncharacteristically tight and fast for The
    Clean, almost foreshadowing Britpop, of all things.</p><p>
<i>Modern Rock</i> dove back under the fuzz a bit, and feels closer to the band's early material than any of
    their other latter-day work; the selections from that album are highlighted by the excellent, organ-painted
    ""Secret Place"", which features distant-sounding drums and a quivering piano lead that's likely to catch
    anyone hearing it for the first time well off-guard.  By the time <i>Unknown Country</i> dropped in 1996,
    the band were reaching into new, more East Asian-influenced textures, as evidenced by the drifting ""Wipe Me,
    I'm Lucky"", with its backward cymbals and stream-of-consciousness guitar melody.</p><p>
    
    ""Franz Kafka at the Zoo"" bobs along on echoing keyboards, sporting whispered vocals and a vaguely ambient
    aesthetic that immediately sets it off from its counterparts, including the music-box piano sing-along
    ""Clutch"", a head-on collision of The Who's <i>Tommy</i> and the Beach Boys in Syd Barrett's brain.  Then
    there's ""Balkans"", an instrumental that draws on Eastern European dances and harmonies for a satisfying
    foray into something completely different.  ""Twist Top"" closes the set out with spry rhythms and the
    rallying cry, ""Three million people can be wrong,"" leaving things in high spirits two hours and 46 songs
    after the first disc began.</p><p>
    
    The only release in the Clean canon not represented is 2001's excellent <i>Getaway</i>, which is still widely
    available for anyone interested.  Though not totally comprehensive, at two hours and 46 songs <i>Anthology</i>

Jan Jelinek sings. Pole recruited a rapper for his next full-length. Mouse
    on Mars added the golden-voiced Dodo. Dan Snaith of Manitoba traded his MAX/MSP patches for ba-ba-ba's. Over
    the last three years, a lot of artists making abstract electronic music who previously nodded in the direction
    of pop took a page out of Eric Carmen's book and went all the way. And it's a good thing.</p><p>
    
    It's good because this meeting offers another avenue to explore, not because pop songs are something every
    musician should strive for. There's a lot to be done with this place where experimental electronics and
    chaotic beats collide with pop music. If vocal IDM becomes its own subgenre and history remembers it,
    Schneider TM's year 2000 collaboration with KP.T Michigan on ""The Light 3000"", an inspired remake of The
    Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", will surely be acknowledged as an early classic.</p><p>
    
    What Schneider TM and KP.T Michigan did was to take a perfect song about a brief respite from loneliness
    and remove the respite part. Listening to The Smiths, I always imagined the narrator in ""There Is a Light""
    picking up a telephone to call his friend at the beginning of the song, begging him to take them both to a
    place ""where there's music and there's people who are young and alive."" His home life is terrible, but
    experience has shown him that he can extricate himself, both physically and psychically, by hitting the
    town with his pal. Sure, he welcomes death while riding shotgun beneath the overpass during the chorus,
    but it's because he wants to die happy, not because life isn't worth living. And whatever happens, he is
    not alone.</p><p>
    
    In ""The Light 3000"", on the other hand, I think the friend is imaginary. The way Schneider TM processes his
    voice, I believe in my heart that his request to ""take me out tonight"" could not possibly be answered. He's
    too different, too damaged, a mutant. The warm, glitchy beats are friendly enough, but the narrator is stuck
    at home, maybe forever. When the track first came to my attention in 2000, it became, for a time, a pretty
    hot download on Napster, and the image of thousands of people the world over hearing it over their PC speakers
    as they surfed the web into the wee hours reinforced for me just how painfully lonely ""The Light 3000"" really
    was.</p><p>
    
    The inclusion of ""The Light 3000"" is the best reason to get this six-song EP, which is being released to
    coincide with Schneider TM's forthcoming tour with The Faint. The <i>Binokular</i> EP, where the song first
    appeared, came out on City Slang and never received a proper North American release. Another track from
    <i>Binokular</i>, ""Chotto Matte"", also appears here. ""Chotto Matte"" is okay, but I would have preferred the
    earlier EP's other vocal track, the feedback-laden and melodic ""Onnanoko"".</p><p>
    
    The rest of the <i>6 Peace</i> EP is filled out with the album version of ""Reality Check"" from last year's
    <i>Zoomer</i>, a solid, noisier, beat-heavy remix of same by Mogwai and David Jack (taken from the ""Reality
    Check"" 12-inch), and two remixes of ""Frogtoise"", which appeared on the 12-inch of the same name. ""Frogstears""
    is the better of these. The simple arrangement, just acoustic guitar, some digital claps in the background,
    and Dirk Dresselhaus' voice, shows that it's a lovely song even without production accouterment. The harmonica
    fills (!) are a little much, but the song is so likeable it's easy to let Dirk have his Neil Young moment.
    There are videos of ""Reality Check"" and ""Frogtoise"" included, for those interested in that sort of thing,
    but really, this one is all about ""The Light 3000"". Everyone should hear it.</p></div>"|7029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7029-6-peace-ep/|7.5|Mark Richardson

Dosh. Dough. Ducats. Dollars. Green. Cream. Lucre. Luciano. Flow. Call it what you wish, currency's
    agenda remains the same: get paid.  Aphex Twin, AFX, Richard D. James, DJ Pritchard D. Jams Cash'n Carry,
    Polygon Window, Caustic Window, Soit PP, Q-Chastic, or The Diceman, by any other name, he'd still be the
    eclectic cult of personality electronic genius that we've seemingly known for years. He's been all about
    the Benjamins more than any of his fans would care to admit. He lives in a bank for Christ's sake! Prolific
    through the mid-90s, Richard D. James seems content now to frustrate fans with half-assed double-disc sets,
    blow ears with full-frequency acid-mashed DJ sets with the likes of Russell Haswell, and wow his closest
    mates with amazing tracks that might never leave his laptop.</p><p>
    
    Today we are left with the scraps from his bygone days as a mischievous media icon, in a subdued pewter
    digipak containing two discs' worth of musical whoredom, as he remixes both the academic and the absurd
    with equal amounts of aplomb, pisstakes, and irreverence for the source material. That attitude helps it
    all go down, especially as he deals with the early 90s' alternative casualties of war. He reduces Curve's
    ""Falling Free"" to Toni Halliday's bare voice, rebuilding her as a siren calling amidst crashing acid throbs,
    and for years it has remained a watermark in James' remix repertoire. Seefeel's ""Time to Find Me"" stays
    surprisingly close to the original, adding a bit more percussion but keeping its 90s crunch crispy and
    intact. Similarly, he ratchets up St. Etienne's ""Your Voice My Head"" with some burping bass and metallic
    thumps, making the head nod. One hit wonders Jesus Jones have their forgotten ""Ones and Zeroes"" decimated
    to the point of grateful extinction, as not a scrap of their sound is audible over its six minutes. Instead,
    the Aphex Twin Hovercraft is in full regalia, all disembodied lucid dream formations hovering in haunted
    washes of dislocated drums.</p><p>
    
    Most hilarious is what he does to millionaire simp Trent Reznor. Paid absurd amounts in an attempt to remix
    Nine Inch Nails and soup up his stuff with that Aphex action, James leaves the odious source tapes unheard
    on ""The Beauty of Being Numb Section B"", opting for something equally obnoxious. Meandering on the keyboards
    for the first half of the song, he then decides to blow through a straw uninterestedly and cut up some
    wide-mouthed yawns for the remainder. Not exactly a great track, but apropos for the wretched artist in
    question. ""At the Heart of It All"" is similarly lethargic and half-assed, sounding like he slowed ""Ventolin""
    down to 16 RPM and then poured on some slowly heaving, molasses-thick brass.</p><p>
    
    Not that the more highbrow and academic musicians get a reprieve from the caustic magic: Gavin Bryars'
    near-perfect minimalist piece, ""Sinking of the Titanic"", is drowned out by the droning of some well-heeled
    passengers on the boat, as loud metal drums slowly flood the mix and overtake it completely. While unmindful,
    it's a pleasant enough take on the composer. Less listenable is a track James spent a good deal of time
    tweaking, the ponderous Philip Glass orchestration of Bowie/Eno's ""Heroes"", furious in its velocity and
    swooping sound manipulations, with strings gnashing about as Bowie's melodramatic squawks buzz by.  The
    beatless structure he creates is interesting, yet it remains a cold take that you won't be returning to.
    More interesting is how he manipulates the easy-listening marshmallows of Mike Flowers Pops' ""Debase"" and
    twists it into something closer to his own take on Candyland.</p><p>
    
    Loving care is given to his mates, though. He takes stabs at no less than five artists on his Rephlex label,
    all to the most interesting results. The Gentle People's ""Journey"" is a Paradise of extended exotica, like
    Les Baxter and tiki huts out on the MIR Space Station, where the repeated reverberated refrain of ""We're
    taking you on a journey,"" becomes a veritable mantra. Kinesthesia's ""Triachus"" could almost be a Tom Waits
    remix, all junkyard clanging and dust-caked noises, with slow swells of synth breaking through the metal
    clunks. His remix of 808 State's acid classic ""Flow Coma"" even has a twisted hip-hop feel to it, wheeling
    forward and back, popping and snapping as he spins and halts the frequencies masterfully. Baby Ford's house
    track is similarly frenzied, which is not surprising, as they're two of his more recent efforts.</p><p>
    
    In hindsight-- and listening to this release, in particular-- it's easy to see how Richard James recycles
    his own ideas in the various remixes and his own songs. At the same time as he was doing his Joyrex bangers,
    he was also jackhammering the tracks for Mescalinum United. Meat Beat Manifesto's remix could easily hail
    from <i>I Care Because You Do</i>. And the string sounds that he honed to a cerebellum-slicing edge for his
    <i>Richard D. James Album</i> get trial runs not only through the Gavin Bryars track, but also through the
    mercurial mashing of goth-rocker Phillip Boa's ""Deep in Velvet"", as well as the endearing remix of Thrill
    Jockey glitch resident Nobukazu Takemura's ""Let My Fish Loose"".  More Beat than beat-oriented, he loops
    some acoustic bass with flute trills, all the while abducting Aki Tsuyuko's little girl voice and taking it
    to various locales: the bottom of a well, the middle of a stirring pit orchestra, out on a pastoral
    countryside, and down through the cavernous alien world of ring modulation, twisting her gentle frequencies
    into a nasty extreme that's at once cute and irritating.</p><p>
    
    Most surprising of all is what he does with one of his old <i>Selected Ambient Works</i> tracks. ""SAW2 CD1
    TRK 2"" was always a favorite of mine; a lonesome Ligeti-like lilt lost amid dark funhouse mirrors. Here it's
    restored to its original version, as once heard on the John Peel show, in which the ""ambient"" track is merely
    an eerie backdrop for a vicious acid workover. The drums bubble and hiss like gas escaped from slashing
    ginsu blades, building into a delicious bumping middle section. It's such a delirious pleasure that it makes
    me question that perhaps the entire two discs of <i>Selected Ambient Works II</i> might merely be clipped of
    their nasty beats, and thus presented as mere halves of their former selves.</p><p>
    
    So what we're left with is a set that could have easily arrived back in '97, with little or no loss of
    quality. That frustrating gestation period aside, many of the tracks here are certified classics, and it's
    nice to have them all in one place, best approached in small doses. Dated, yes, but James' ahead-of-the-curve
    deposits are still accruing enough interest to serve as a polite introduction to his oeuvre.</p></div>"|227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/227-26-mixes-for-cash/|7.7|Andy Beta

    arcs and the myths of authenticity. Every punk chronicle (see <i>The Filth and the Fury</i> for a great
    filmic example) takes pains to link the idiom's genesis to societal rot, and to present its pioneers as
    singular and messianic. Blues patriarchs are particularly burdened with extratextual prerequisites: they
    could never just have been horny or melodic; they must have been poor, or criminals, or on Satan's guestlist,
    or channelers of the anguish of the enslaved. <i>Yes Yes Y'all</i>, a new oral history of hip-hop's
    Cretaceous period, subtly makes the ancient argument that hip-hop was born of urban decay and civil
    dysfunction, and that its early practitioners were visionaries whose realness the current church must
    strive to uphold.</p><p>
    
    Shiiiit. Enter Ryan Kidwell, aka Cex, a talented, accomplished, and complicated 21 year-old who, for my
    filthy lucre, hasn't made a good album yet, despite his gifts with sound-collage and pose-analysis. He gets
    unfairly dubbed an nth-generation suburban fraud, but wait: if that oft-gonged municipal hellhole theory is
    valid, he should be packing more cred than Fitty Cent, because, let's face it (s'blanket-statement time,
    homesnakes), Baltimore sucks.  That town's hipper denizens have been trying to construe John Waters'
    tackiness as a virtue for too long.   Cex's B-More, which he extols on some of this album's better
    tracks (""Gigolo Knights"", ""Ghost Rider""), gave its once-cool downtown to ESPNZone, and embodies the worst
    elements of both sides of its North-South conflation. The dumpsters there say ""Ameriwaste"" on them. The
    Great Blacks In Wax Museum is glorious, but all the nearby pay-per-hour hotel rooms have tripods in them
    and guys in turbans swapping briefcases and jetskis in the parking lots.</p><p>
    
    Cex keeps calling B-More by its chamber-of-commerce mis-moniker Charm City, when he's got to know that Harm
    City, Perm City, and Chud City are more befitting.  But anyway, he rejects the rap-as-a-cultural-barometer
    argument, rhyming on the bold ""Bad Acne"" that genres can be ""police states"": ""I'm not pissing on tradition
    but stagnation I be hating."" Then he shoots down rap's Importance, saying it's not ""the key to revolution,
    it's just a fucking distraction."" That copout is characteristic of this record, which takes risks but then
    insists that nothing's at stake (Temporary Residence honcho and Sonna frontman Jeremy Devine jokes of Cex
    on his eponymous skit, ""You're rapping about dodgeball and bicycles""). Later during ""Acne"", Cex says he's
    ""never really been an entertainer, just a snake oil salesman."" Now you can't hand a critic a lubricated
    mallet like that. Yes, this is Cex's first all-MC venture, and though he was poised to drop a bomb, he
    dropped the ball; despite his ambition, he comes across as a nervous huckster who talks fast in hopes of
    preventing the listener from thinking.</p><p>
    
    One minute he climbs the peaks of brag-rap, and the next he's deprecating himself at the bottom of the ocean.
    One minute he's talking trash and trying to come across as wielding a mack's fleet wood; and the next he's
    all biographical and heartfelt, putting the emo in memoir. Mixing shit up is fine and all, but this record
    conveys a Cex-in-transition who is having a crisis of confidence about whether to keep being penis-checking
    funny or to chase some bantam meaning.  The amazingly urgent and ominous ""Childhood of a Leader"" (one of
    several weak titles-- see also ""Good Morning, Universe"") shows that Cex is thematically on par with Eminem,
    but the song's almost out of place on this goof-trip album (though Cex goes out with some Revelation-rejecting
    9/11 proclamations on the record's finale).</p><p>
    
    His embarrassing flow suggests the Fresh Prince's early crap, or a pubescent Prime Minister Pete Nice. Only
    three beats on the album aren't cursory, and even his great backing tracks subscribe, unfortunately, to the
    dynamics of the indie rock Cex loved, saving their best moments for the choruses instead of rocking the
    whole time. The ""serious"" passages are uncomfortably close cousins of Cex's online blogs. The record seems
    like an aural playbill for Cex's swell live show instead of a stand-alone effort. He's frequently hilarious
    (the Jesus stuff, the Preparation H ref, the Morningstar corn dog allusion, the smart and party-denial-trolling
    line about orgasms that make his partner forget Afghanistan), but he seems capable of being much more than
    a glitch-hop Andy Dick.</p><p>
    
    This masturbauteur is very different from, say, a shameful Lou Barlow; he wants to
    get off on selling you raps about him getting himself off. Spare yourself from entering this feedback loop
    of need, which, if you'll forgive the inorganic full-circle-wholeness of this review, reminds me of the
    life-force-draining vibe of certain B-More streets.  Cex's recorded output makes a case for considering him
    a fascinating exhibit, but not yet wholly an artist or entertainer.</p></div>"|1388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1388-tall-dark-and-handcuffed/|4.4|William Bowers

How about for a
    band that's enjoyed perhaps one of the longest runs of greatness in indie rock's brief history?  Yo La
    Tengo formed just as indie rock-as-we-know-it was getting its wings in the mid-80s.  Sure, they didn't get
    really great until <i>Painful</i> dropped in 1993, pointing to a turn away from alt-country dynamics and
    toward dronier organ-rock and guitar freakouts-- but they sure as shit haven't let up since, kicking out
    consistently remarkable full-lengths roughly every three years.</p><p>
    
    2000's <i>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</i> was the first sign that they might be running out of
    ideas.  Though an incredibly strong record from any band that deep into a rock music career, and packed with
    touching breakup songs and beautiful, semi-experimental atmospheres, the across-the-map diversity the band
    had become known for was notably absent.  Unfortunately, <i>Summer Sun</i> confirms suspicions, and, sadder
    still, marks Yo La Tengo's first album since their 1986 debut, <i>Ride the Tiger</i>, to lack invention
    altogether.</p><p>
<i>Summer Sun</i> is pleasant, if nothing else, but that's such a loaded word for an album that clearly
    aspires to (and ought to be) so much more than it accomplishes.  At least if the album had been completely
    wretched, it could have been dismissed as an unwitting experiment or some such foolishness.  But it ain't,
    and that's the shame of it all; <i>Summer Sun</i> consistently reaches a height of disposability so static
    and homogenous that it simply must be dispersed over an hour's worth of music.  This isn't the sound of one
    of the most prominent institutions in independent music maturing; it's more like decomposing.</p><p>
    
    It hurts to write that, but pipe the breezy, wistful blue skies of ""Let's Be Still"" through tinny elevator
    speakers, or the sound system of your local Wal-Mart, and it's nothing but indie-muzak.  Call it a natural
    progression from <i>And Then Nothing</i>'s moody, twilit explorations of texture and atmosphere, but
    progression or not, last year's instrumental <i>The Sounds of the Sounds of Science</i> had more creativity
    and dynamism in a single track than the entirety of <i>Summer Sun</i>, and that was a score to fucking nature
    documentaries-- never the most fertile ground for inspiration.</p><p>
    
    For a band that once thrived on its stunning eclecticism, as well as a masterful assimilation of moods and
    styles, to produce an album that's merely pretty is tragic.  Though, even if it smacks of gross underachievement,
    there is something to be said for the competence and simplicity of a record that understands how to gracefully
    fade into the background.  Inasmuch as none of <i>Summer Sun</i>'s songs aim for anything more than hushed,
    dulcet melodies and passive meditations, most of them basically hit their targets.  The same smooth, rolling
    bass, delicate guitar lines, and airy percussion morph almost imperceptibly from the blue skies and bright
    eyes of ""Beach Party Tonight"" to the ghostly call of the Big Star cover ""Take Care"" and all intermediary
    points.  Additional instrumentation of all stripes (strings, brass, piano, and the list goes on) seems
    added as necessary for cosmetic purposes, and the results are rarely less than soothing, if unremarkable.</p><p>
    
    Truly memorable instances are few and far between, and often for the worse; the standout tracks on <i>Summer
    Sun</i> are primarily the beat-poetry jazz drone of ""Nothing But You and Me"" and the highly dubious post-fusion
    wankery of ""Georgia vs. Yo La Tengo"".  It says something, I guess, about the relatively constant quality to
    be found here that the most notable tracks are the weaker ones, but that's kind of sad, isn't it?  Who wants
    to remember an album for the lowlights?</p><p>
    
    If any bright spot is to be found on <i>Summer Sun</i>, it belongs to Georgia Hubley, whose gorgeous, dusky
    alto comes closer to lighting up a room than anything else on this tepid body.  Her voice alone stands
    counter to the various missteps and cardboard cutouts, and alone brings ""Today Is the Day"" and ""Take Care""
    closest to genuinely intimate, affecting glimpses in the midst of tunes that are all too willing to remain
    at arm's length.  In particular, ""Take Care"", as the finale to <i>Summer Sun</i>, steeps the preceding hour
    of beatific, automatic smiles in a beautiful melancholy, like a knowing and regretful farewell.  I hope
    that's not the case, but if this is truly the next step in Yo La Tengo's move toward some abstract concept
    like artistic maturity, I don't think I want to stick around for the conclusion.</p></div>"|8864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8864-summer-sun/|6.0|Eric Carr

Beyond \x93Chief Boot Knocka\x94, though, Seattle, Washington is better 
    known for Eddie Vedder's plaid party pad than its vital hip-hop scene. This is good and bad: on one hand, since it's neither a Borough nor Cali, heads don't automatically look to Seattle for the 
    freshest rhymes, leaving its hip-hop denizens to fight harder for wider recognition. On the other hand, the city's a blank slate; since Seattle rappers don't have any Kool Hercs to answer to 
    (metaphorically, of course), they can be as creative as possible without laboring in anyone's shadow, or living up to their city's prescribed heritage.</p><p>
    Despite Seattle's lack of heavy hip-hop baggage, the Oldominion collective works hard to properly represent their cities (the massive, more than 20-person crew operates out of Seattle and Portland). 
    Barring Portland-based Quannum duo Lifesavas, they've recently been the most visible Pacific Northwest rappers, joining the West Coast legs of the Def Jux and Anticon tours. More 
    importantly, they come the closest to defining a specific Northwest hip-hop sound; their characteristically moody production and thoughtful lyrics often illuminate a dark spirituality behind 
    constant references to <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and their own <i>Wizard of Oz</i>-like mythology (based on Seattle's nickname as \x93Emerald City\x94).</p><p>
    Norman is the shared (somewhat sociopathic) alter ego of two of Oldominiox92s most prominent figures: producer Onry Ozzborn and rapper Barfly. It's a concept album surrounding the life of 
    \x93Normax94 (i.e. <i>Psycho</i>'s Norman Bates), and immediately, the character is established as a hard-luck outcast without a definitive hip-hop past.  On the first track \x93One Man Band\x94, Onry 
    rhymes, \x93Normax92s the type of guy who never listened to LL/ Alice Cooper, Slipknot and Godsmack were the ones in headphones/ And Normax92s the type of guy that I love no matter the 
    cost/  We goix92 crazy together...creatix92 scientific clones.\x94  With its matter-of-fact, distinctive cadence, the song comes off like a macabre, alienated counterpart/response to Aesop 
    Rock's beloved \x93Lucy\x94; a Moog-like melody stumbles across the chorus, and Claude Denjeax92s campy vision is given ominous new life. On the stellar \x93Human Traffic\x94, Onry's affinity for 
    ambient record-crackle beats is woven among melancholic violins, minimalist kick-drum, and deep, funky keyboards. A different version of the record crackle shows up later on \x93Weastwick UTD\x94 
    during its clever soccer metaphor, in which Norman \x93runs the wrong way down the field.\x94  At one hilarious point, Barfly halfway approximates a Brit accent and screams, \x93Oy, oy, motherfuckers! 
    I love Stiff Little Fingers pointix92 at suckas!\x94</p><p>
    Of course, if Norman and the rest of the Oldominion crew wanna forge on with a new sound independent of hip-hop's forbears, they gotta rep for their town, and it wouldn't be a Seattle hip-hop 
    record if these dudes didn't make a smack reference. On \x93Martyr\x94 they rhyme, \x93Perry Farrell/ Jim Carroll/ I'm scared of the devil/ This is my <i>Basketball Diary</i>/ And the perils of attaining 
    these heights is falling fifty stories into syringes/ Harmony Korine's <i>KIDS</i>...Renee Zellweger and the lead singer of Hole/ I don't even have to say her name, I think you know.\x94 The duo's 
    cadences play leapfrog with the beats, and they often rap at halftime for a surreal effect. The depressive, layered production reflects the isolating, wet darkness that grips the Pacific 
    Northwest nine months out of the year.  It's the unmistakable sound of Seattle hip-hop.</p></div>"|5837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5837-polarity/|8.3|Julianne Shepherd

    With intricate shades of the vines that myriad-cloven 
    Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs...</i></p><p>
    So begins Sidney Lanier's epic poem <i>The Marshes of Glynn</i>, with a lush and transcendent streak of southern naturalism. It's the same feeling I get when I cue up 
    Kopernik's self-titled first album, put out by Scott Herrex92s home-spun Eastern Developments label.  The duo-- Tim DeLaney and Brad Lewis-- are a center of gravity that started 
    warping space as the pop-ambient duo The Sight-Seers, as in Delarosa and Asora's <i>Crush the Sight-Seers</i> EP (Delaney's thick upright tone will be familiar to those 
    whose heads have nodded to Savath and Savalis). A late track called \x93The Sea and the Marsh Are One\x94 is based on a symphonic version of Lanier's poem, which is an ode to 
    the aquatic splendors of Georgia. In fact, the whole album comes off like the soundtrack for an apocalyptic riverboat cruise. No need for alarm, folks; these boys are natives of 
    Decatur, Georgia.</p><p>
    First a shimmering pool opens up in mid-deck, and steady pulses of backwards piano ripple out into a mournful pizzicato bass. When the bowing starts, it occurs to me that I'm listening 
    to the product of many late-night layers and reversals, waves of addition and subtraction that leave the source material long since dissolved. I later learn that Brad Lewis calls the process 
    \x93crushing\x94.  ""The pieces are slowly built-up off of my initial abstracts,\x94 says Lewis on his website. \x93Tim comes in and adds new melodies, chord stacks and strong but supple bass lines 
    to the original themes and phrases. Finally, after adding a few highlights and accents, we both step back and strip the piece down in layers, sometimes revealing new simpler and 
    chance discoveries...\x94</p><p>
    A single chord sways in and out, and a half-cadence rises in what even the first time around is obviously The Moment, like an old max92s pupil dilating fully at the moment of his 
    death, the foam of hope on a current of despair.  Lanier drives us on:</p><p>
<i>Chamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves, 
    Cells for the passionate pleasure of prayer to the soul that grieves...</i></p><p>
    Suddenly I realize that without the help of attack or envelope, a backwards piano sounds a hell of a lot like a clarinet.  The improv bass figures seem to know where the ethereal synth-cloud 
    is headed; is the bass really leading, or just following in reverse? I stop wondering when a twangy 12/8 figure pushes its own dopey heat into a fretless-bass solo; skittish strings and a curt, 
    chimpy lament lead into a lavish Mediterranean experiment that for the first time seems composed rather than found. Then \x93Kopernistax94 flings us out into the savage Central Asian plain, with 
    crackly electronics sucking at struck bass fifths as at a wild yak's teat. A sustained dirge opens on a weathered wooden casket, but a broken beat lights the way to the slitted burial chamber of 
    clarinet. Now seething:</p><p>
<i>When length was fatigue, and when breadth was but bitterness sore, 
    And when terror and shrinking and dreary unnamable pain 
    Drew over me out of the merciless miles of the plain...</i></p><p>
    The Moment now turns in on itself with a huge major cadence, throated into distortion then flicked off like a reel-to-reel. The cosmic bombast of Lanier lines like \x93Unafraid, I am fain to face/ The vast 
    sweet visage of space\x94 is laid over the lappings and swells of a full orchestra. Even with all the skips and reversals, the constant interference, it's difficult to tell: are we in a concert hall or a tuner 
    in someone's darkened bedroom? Has Chris sampled the rehearsals of his Dad's unfinished symphony and fed them through his friend's laptop? A French horn rises and submerges in the 
    marsh; the camera sweeps out to endless sea, with a simple, sweet electric guitar lullaby to keep the credits rolling. </p><p>
    This is an experiment in cathartic orchestration, and studio ebb-and-flow. There are enough thick browns and reds, creeks topped with red and yellow leaves, \x93marshes meshed with a million veins,\x94 
    muddy deltas, and grainy sea floors.  Inside, there's an epic drama set in geologic time, where everything is either washing, washed away, or water. The flow is endless while it lasts: father-son 
    nostalgia, cinematic hubris, a saccharine death sigh, all in service of a hymn to the sea expressed in mere water.  The endless pivot of the whole album-- The Moment-- is just a dark dilation 
    on some deathbed, opening on the first light of the last day of the rest of reverse-life. </p><p>

    car at dusk, on a hill overlooking his town.  With him is the nameless boy he's recently been hired to kill
    by Gilman Crowe, a senior with a fake Neo-Nazi streak.  The boy finds all sorts of aesthetic and emotional
    pleasure in watching people in the town below turn their lights on one by one as they realize it's getting
    dark. The distant and depersonalized movements become the patterns in a non-pictorial language: a flash here
    and a flash there. He does a similar thing with stars. As Larry says, ""When you imagine the stars are a far
    away, upside-down city at night they seem more important.""  Larry later realizes, when reading the boy's
    notebook, that he just can't carry out the deed.  As a reader of the novel, you get second-hand information
    about what's covered in the journal, but Cooper avoids offering too much about how the boy went about it or
    where his language took him. The aura of the unknown remains intact.</p><p>
    Wolf Eyes' latest is the aural equivalent of Cooper's aforementioned scene, another bold bit in the band's
    steady onslaught of material.  Listening to <i>Dead Hills</i>, I saw Larry and the boy falling apart to AM
    radio hiss, barely recognizing the patterns around them, nonetheless sensing something sinking into and
    altering their emotional states. Current 93 channeled a similarly pre-lingual world of death and sex through
    their feedback, but where David Tibet evokes the haunting pre-Surrealist imagery of Lautréamont, Wolf Eyes
    act as the equivalent of three horror-obsessed punks in a forest, destroying a house by fire, watching their
    own homemade pitch-shifters burn and sing.</p><p>
    Since getting their start in the cassette underground in 1997, Wolf Eyes have produced over 40 releases,
    each archiving a beautifully troubling practice.  With an approach to music akin to Vienna Actionism or a
    second-generation snuff film, Wolf Eyes bleed analog, mark their territory with piss, and shout all crazed
    over layers of sirens and random pulses. Aaron Diloway (Hanson Records), John Olson (American Tapes), and
    Nate Young (who builds much of Wolf Eyes' equipment) are Ann Arbor, Michigan's most interesting band, and
    the town's most explosive assault on regularity since Negative Approach busted up in 1984, or perhaps since
    John Brannon's post-Negative Approach act Laughing Hyenas hit their peak around 1990.</p><p>
    The title track from <i>Dead Hills</i> is its most impressive piece, launching from Colecovision explosions
    into tape loops running backwards before high-pitched rattling creaks like rusted gates over a stock horror
    film ding-dong effect, one of those incidental noises intended to signify that the person on screen should
    duck or run.  It's equally reminiscent of suburban decay, conveying images of a pained girl drinking whiskey
    in a quilt-covered bed, hearts on her wall, a stuffed animal squirrel at her side, and a screaming wolf
    stenciled onto her headboard per Sue de Beer's <i>Hans und Grete</i>.  In eleven minutes, ""Dead Hills""
    shifts from tired video game rolls into rabid bugs and the screams of wounded animals. By song's end the
    shit has really hit the fan: a tempest of hijacked past-future laser guns run amok (and if you look closely
    to stage right you can spot Merzbow dancing with eyes closed-- he looks happy!).  Like a nature recording
    of a forest in which each object has a contact microphone duct taped to its back, the agonizing, detailed
    noises define the lives of snowflakes' voices, screaming as they melt on the asphalt.</p><p>
    The next two seances-- ""Dead Hills 2"" and ""Rotten Tropics""-- are more percussive, and kind of slinky, relying
    on overt shouts from their human singer to make their point.  Unfortunately, the mystery of the first ""Dead
    Hills"" becomes a Big Black loop, like David Yow keeping apace with Cock E.S.P.   But trying to find concrete
    musical analogies for the Wolf Eyes magic-- especially after being so fucking blown away by ""Dead Hills""--
    is unfair, and a bit of a letdown.  The songs aren't weak, but they've already shown us what was written in
    the book. Never do that; keep shit hidden. Relegating the record to more obvious categorization, the entire
    offering seem less heroic and more human for its epilogue.</p><p>
    Despite this last-minute fall from the sublime, <i>Dead Hills</i>' 24 minutes are a briefly frightening
    fragment, a churning mass in the continually evolving oeuvre of one of the underground's most important
    tweaked-out bands. Outside any historical context, it force-feeds you, one by one, the screeching souls
    of those crickets you tortured as a kid.</p></div>"|8729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8729-dead-hills/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

In some ways, it feels weird to pay
    for them. They are, after all, essentially advertisements for a business,
    which is something we're used to getting for free. The fact that they're
    often extremely variable in terms of overall sound doesn't help. When each
    track seems completely unrelated to the one before, and the CD doesn't seem
    like anything you would ever listen to straight through, the comp feels more
    like something that should be inserted <i>gratis</i> into a magazine.</p><p>
    
    There are exceptions. Some label comps actually become classics in their own
    right. Take 2000's <i>Putting the Morr Back in Morrissey</i>. It elevated
    German label Morr Music by laying bare the label's aesthetic direction and
    managing to sound like a cohesive record.  There was <i>No New York</i>,
    the Brian Eno-produced introduction to New York's then-burgeoning no-wave
    scene, featuring four tracks a piece from the now-legendary acts The
    Contortions, Teenage Jesus &amp; The Jerks, Mars, and DNA.  And then there's
    <i>Wanna Buy a Bridge?</i>, the 1980 Rough Trade collection that introduced
    America to bands like The Raincoats, Scritti Politti and Cabaret Voltaire.
    I've never heard <i>Wanna Buy a Bridge?</i>, but the fact that I've heard
    <i>of</i> it, 23 years after its release, speaks to its classic status.
    You can't say that about Digital Hardcore's <i>You've Got the Fucking
    Power</i>.</p><p>
<i>Wanna Buy a Craprak?</i>, the first compilation from New York's Carpark
    Records, doesn't quite reach those lofty heights but it has a lot to
    recommend. First, it sounds great as a single record. There's a fine line
    between ""these tracks share a sound and attitude"" and ""all the artists on
    this label sound alike,"" but Carpark winds up on the good side of the
    divide. There is a definable sound to Carpark. Or sounds, I should say.
    Certain characteristics carry over from one artist to the next: No melody
    fear. Respect for the acoustic guitar. Warmth. Three styles predominate
    and the label's artists do them all well.</p><p>
    
    I'm in love with the sound of an acoustic guitar being dragged and dropped,
    and <i>Wanna Buy a Craprak?</i> delivers plenty. Greg Davis' ""Brocade"",
    from a forthcoming album, is at least as lovely as anything on his underrated
    <i>Arbor</i>. Davis knows how to mix minimalist fingerpicking patterns with
    subtle beats and gentle noises; something about the fresh clarity of his sound
    reminds me of a cool but sunny spring afternoon. Marumari's ""Saka"" has an
    electric guitar, but the clean tone and processed slides, bumping up against
    some piano tinkling and choppy percussion, give the track a laptop folk
    feel. Ogurusu Norihide's ""5:00"", from the just-released <i>Modern</i>, nods
    more deeply to tradition, as he spins a sentimental mountainside shuffle on
    steel string and bass with only the vaguest hint of digital processing. And
    then Hrvatski offers the tense, jittery exclusive track ""Equinox"", which
    builds acoustic guitar, feedback, accordion and percussion into something
    approaching pop until the track disintegrates toward the end.</p><p>
    
    Carpark has also shown an interest in 80s-inspired synthpop.  Dinky's ""No
    Love"" (also found on her debut <i>Black Cabaret</i>) sounds both haughty
    and cheap, and some effective background vocals manage cancel out Andrea
    E. Perez' predictably bored delivery. Better is Takagi Masakatsu's
    big-hearted ""Golden Town with Sunglasses"", which goes new wave in an
    endearingly clumsy four-track style, someone mumbling underneath the
    synths like a Silk Road Sukpatch. And finally, Kit Clayton &amp; Safety
    Scissors' ""17-11"" shares a lot with the Super_Collider IDMR&amp;B; of <i>Raw
    Digits</i>, though with inferior songwriting.</p><p>
    
    The final Carpark category belongs to the ambient stuff. So Takahashi's
    gurgling ""Blue, Blue, Electronic Blue"" is aggressively lovely, a slowly
    modulating drone that oozes light and texture. Kid 606 kicks in the spare
    ""If My Heart Ever Ran Away It Would Be Looking for the Day When Right Beside
    You It Could Forever Stay"" (from the <i>Soccergirl</i> EP), which is nice enough,
    but almost too simple for its own good. And Casino Versus Japan's ""Aquarium""
    (from <i>Whole Numbers Play the Basics</i>) is dominated by softly falling
    organ chords, giving an effect that's nostalgic and dreamlike, a slowdance
    song from a parallel universe. The three primary styles on <i>Wanna Buy a
    Craprak?</i> really do blend together nicely, the thing is sequenced well
    and flows, and Carpark's artists are accomplished. A label compilation worth
    owning.</p></div>"|1861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1861-wanna-buy-a-craprak/|7.6|Mark Richardson

    to rule the minds of men through the manipulative powers of sound?  I submit that there can not; the job
    prospects from a degree like that are, like, what?  Music therapist?  I don't think so.  The only career
    I can imagine it successfully leading to is Supervillian.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't take a superhuman intellect to see
    through the aims of Jon DeRosa's education-- he's the arch-mastermind behind the warm, homey folk of Pale
    Horse and Rider, and has guested on several other records, including <i>Debridement</i>, a recent Chairkickers
    release by Rivulets.  But none of his various projects are more dangerous, more insidious, than the icy calm
    of Aarktica's dreamy ambiance.  In fact, his nefarious desire to lull listeners into a pliant, peaceful
    daydream (and then rob them, no doubt-- or worse!) could easily have succeeded with last year's <i>Or You
    Could Just Go Through Your Whole Life and Be Happy Anyway</i> if it weren't for the heroic actions of
    Pitchfo...  hey, wait.  That got a really positive review...  uuuhhhh.... now... that... I think about it,
    <i>Pure Tone Audiometry</i> is really... <i>pretty</i>...  oh, god, no...  if I don't come back, tell
    Kathleen Hanna... I... love... her...</p><p>
    
    Wow... where was I?</p><p>
    
    I always get distracted by the lush, diffuse tones at the conclusion of ""Out to Sea"".  The track opens <i>Pure
    Tone Audiometry</i> with a delicate, Magnetic Fields-ish male/female vocal dynamic between DeRosa and
    Lorraine Lelis, as they sweetly harmonize over the romantic notions of being lost at sea and never again
    seeing home.  Before long, the voices become lost in the hazy ambiance completely, and the experimental
    pop is vaporized; only Lelis' seraphic call remains to try and navigate the listener through the droning
    fog.  Eventually, even the music itself vanishes.</p><p>
    
    DeRosa's arrangements are intensely careful and subdued, and never once does he allow his deliberately
    constructed tranquility to be disturbed.  The few real swells of emotion are thrilling, but momentary;
    such an austere, clinical tone is produced that it sometimes becomes stultifying, although I'm not sure
    emotive response is the aim here.  Aarktica is cold, pure, and almost inescapably tranquil.</p><p>
    
    ""Snowstorm Ruins Birthday"" revisits the vapor that lingers from ""Out to Sea"".  There <i>was</i> music here,
    but now only traces remain, surrounding the listener in a wintry mist of component sounds, atomic gray
    noise, a touching (but still distant) pop melody dissolved into its basic elements.  Slowly, song structures
    reform; DeRosa's wispy vocals return alongside Lelis' stunning accompaniment, triumphantly welling up from
    miles beneath the faintly reverberating electric and simple acoustic plucking in ""Ocean""'s beautiful climax.
    ""Big Year"" explores the darker regions of Aarktica's ethereal shoegazing like a slightly cheerier version
    of Projekt-based ambient artists Lycia; the listener is inexorably pulled deeper into the track's echoing
    maze of acoustics, subtly ominous drones, and trembling strings.</p><p>
    
    Until... total silence?</p><p>
    
    No, wait.  Not <i>total</i>.  DeRosa slipped up; ""Water Wakes Dead Cells"" is a five-minute foray into
    ultra-minimalist drone, just a rhythmic pulse wrapped in a barely audible hum, before eventually bowing
    out completely.  The sheer vacancy of what amounts to little more than empty space is pretty unnecessary,
    and though it's anything but jarring, it still stands out as a glaring hole in an otherwise pristine calm.
    As a breather before ""Williamsburg Counterpoint"", <i>Pure Tone Audiometry</i>'s twelve-minute centerpiece,
    ""Water Wakes Dead Cells"" is briefly very effective.  By the halfway point, though, the album's hypnotic
    spell has been broken-- it served as an anticlimactic pause, but after a few minutes, it just seems like
    a good time to get a drink, to make my escape.</p><p>
    
    Ah, who am I kidding?  Aarktica's attempt to pacify and control his audience into a narcotized lull is good
    but not perfect.  Of course, it's too late for me, but at least you've been warned.  Jon DeRosa is a madman!
    He wants to control the world with his beautiful, antiseptic melodies!  He's nearly succeeded yet again!
    Tell the world before it's too late!</p></div>"|6.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6-pure-tone-audiometry/|7.4|Eric Carr

The Exploding Hearts are not tongue-in-cheek punk-pop revivalists, and they aren't postmodern pastiche artists borrowing an abandoned aesthetic for the sake of cultural commentary. In fact, from their bright pink-and-yellow album art to their shamelessly Sex Pistols-esque poses, The Exploding Hearts make it clear from the outset that they're not too concerned with being taken seriously-- by you or anybody.</p>
<p>At first glance, it would be easy to write off the Exploding Hearts as another pop/punk band that never mentally evolved past the 10th grade. But on their debut full-length, <i>Guitar Romantic</i>, the ridiculous geekdom that comes through the Hearts' ""cool"" façade like grease through a Big Mac wrapper pays off in spades, as the Portland four-piece cuts right to the energetic heart of power-pop, evoking vintage Soft Boys, The Only Ones, and-- though undoubtedly through sheer coincidence-- The Apples in Stereo's first seven-inches.</p>
<p>The first thing you're likely to notice about <i>Guitar Romantic</i> is the production. It's clipped-out and fuzzy, burying the VU needle at +3. There's no subtlety to be found here: Everything is pushed so far to the top of the mix that the instruments all blend together into a fuzzy two-dimensional sonic image. In this context, the sound works perfectly-- there's no reason anything here should be anywhere except at the front. With all the instruments appropriately (or, perhaps, inappropriately) loud, the focus falls squarely on the songs themselves, which is where The Exploding Hearts' namesake becomes all too fitting.</p>
<p>The band wastes no time kicking your ass, either: The opener, ""Modern Kicks"", is easily one of <i>Guitar Romantic</i>'s best tracks, and perfectly exemplifies what makes this band's music so infectious. With its driving rhythm and insanely catchy vocal hook delivered in a bratty faux-English accent, the song plays out like an anthemically poppy and distinctly American incarnation of The Buzzcocks. But <i>Guitar Romantic</i> peaks with ""Sleeping Aides and Razor Blades"", mining the energetic melodies of everything from Big Star to Nick Lowe to the misplaced 50s-isms and lobotomized abandon of The Ramones.</p>
<p>There are points throughout <i>Guitar Romantic</i> where parallels could be drawn to The Strokes, and indeed, the two bands seem to be working from a pretty similar tradition. But where The Strokes embody a self-conscious, affected ""cool"" that involves preening their hair to make it look like they just woke up, and their music sometimes seems similarly premeditated and self-conscious, The Exploding Hearts simply have no shame. These guys indulge in power-pop like true hedonists, their unmitigated passion for the music negating any shred of the hipness their influences imply. At first, it's confounding that a band with such a keen sense of songcraft would adopt a style aesthetic that combines punk cliché with an L.A. Looks advertisement, but their style, like their sound, comes across as a product of unabashed enthusiasm and near-ridiculous reverence for the music.</p>
<p>All this discussion, of course, seems irrelevant when the record's playing. At the end of the day, <i>Guitar Romantic</i> is simply a fucking awesome power-pop record that would've been just as relevant and engaging twenty-five years ago, and will undoubtedly be just as fun twenty-five years down the road. It may seem glaringly retro on the surface, but The Exploding Hearts have released an album that is, at its core, ageless.</p>

    authentic stuff: I'm down with the flu. So sick am I, in fact, that I think I'm going to let David Bowie
    take it from here.</p><p>
<i>""This will have to be one of my favorite albums of the year so far. All of the Johnston traits are here
    in abundance. Beautiful melodies, fine if painful lyrics, and a searching poignancy that clutches the heart
    like iced velvet.""</i></p><p>
    
    Thanks, Dave, dig the ""iced velvet"" simile.  Very glam. Readers: Your Daniel Johnston CD has just been
    reviewed by David Bowie. Take care and goodnight.</p><p>
    
    Such are the simpering testimonials Daniel Johnston always swam in, flowing from the oddest sources--
    Eddie Vedder, Matt Groening, Kurt Cobain-- making him sound less like a favored songwriter and more
    like a pet cause. Even if his celebrity fans are truly interested in giving Daniel exposure rather than
    spritzing their own images with outsider chic, all they accomplish is forever interlocking Johnston's
    music (simple and lovely and undeserving of any awe) with his famed manic depression. </p><p>
    
    As it usually happens in these cases, it's the No. 1 fan who commits the most egregious <i>faux pas</i>
    of all. Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse-- who had proven his devotion to Johnston by covering ""Hey Joe"" and
    ""My Yoke Is Heavy""-- got to produce <i>Fear Yourself</i>. ""Daniel is a gift to us,"" he embarrassingly
    gushes on the sticker blurb, though the album-- despite being credited solely to Johnson-- is pretty much
    Mark's gift to Daniel. Linkous handled all arrangements and played most instruments on the CD, relegating
    the author to vocals and piano. The result, while chock full of beautiful bits, backfires terribly. The
    lacquered production makes Johnston sound like a guest, or rather a ghost, in his own house. His timid
    voice haunts a suddenly spacious mansion, caught in mirror halls of multitracked harmony, bouncing off
    exotic trinkets (Mellotron? Chamberlin? Optigan?!).</p><p>
    
    The opener ""Now"" is a deliberate false start, but also a statement of purpose: as Folk Implosion's
    glossy <i>One Part Lullaby</i> kicks off with a lo-fi guitar figure, ""Now"" spends its first minute as a
    tin-thin boombox recording, gradually funnels in noise, and suddenly emerges in glorious high fidelity!
    For about 30 seconds!  And then ends!  The meta-narrative couldn't be clearer: The Producer is here, come
    to save this poor sap from his lo-fi past. </p><p>
    
    Press materials insist that Linkous stayed out of the genius' way, Albini-style. ""I don't even want to say
    I produced, I'm just ecstatic to have anything to do with getting more of him on tape,"" goes the exact
    quote, but even the most cursory listen debunks this soundbite as positively Rumsfeldian. Who put
    Tinderstick-sized holy-shit orchestra hits on ""Syrup of Tears""? Who turned ""Love Not Dead"" and ""Living It
    for the Moment"" into Britpop pastiche? Did Johnston walk into the studio intent on using french horns and
    glockenspiels on ""Power of Love""?</p><p>
    
    Overproduction is relative, mind you-- I love when bands raid Jon Brion's basement. The problem with <i>Fear
    Yourself</i> is not that it sounds big, rather that it sounds condescending to the man it's supposed to be
    all about, and more importantly, <i>by</i>. The lushness of a ""One Part Lullaby"" or-- I dunno, ""Automatic
    for the People""-- is inoffensive because Barlow and Stipe arrive to it naturally.  But here, it's a handout.
    Linkous, for all his best intentions, implicitly paints Johnston as helpless, his previous output a dry run
    for the big time, his art in need of patronage. Iced velvet, indeed.</p></div>"|4282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4282-fear-yourself/|3.4|Michael Idov

Mad Professor and dub legend/guru Lee \x93Scratch\x94 Perry are being credited as having been heavily involved with <i>Dubtometry</i>-- a drastic reworking of
    <i>Optometry</i>, DJ Spooky's 2002 collaboration with NYC jazz wunderkind Matthew Shipp (avaiable on his Thirsty Ear label)-- but if CD inserts can be trusted, their touch was minimal and
    composite. Their names are attached to only a few of <i>Dubtometry</i>'s seventeen cuts, including mere interludes and Perry's own \x93Jungle Soldier\x94; the prominent placement
    of their monikers on the album cover seems more like a calculated bid for credibility than an accurate representation of the artists and influences on this record, which runs the
    gamut from traditional dub to polished hip-hop and DJ Krust-flavored drum and bass.</p><p>
    The album is mostly successful in its basic mission: taking jazz-fusion and musiq-concrete source material and putting a ballsy urban spin on it, bringing out the
    head nodding libido buried deep inside <i>Optometry</i>'s somewhat pretentious and consciously stolid-- though still impressive-- experimentation.  Many of the remixers on
    <i>Dubtometry</i> drastically improve the quality of their chosen songs by cleverly augmenting their highly traditional jazz identity:  The weak, yawning \x93Parachutes\x94 finds
    itself revitalized with the addition of lilting flute passages and a striding, solid drum beat, breathing life into the original's academic corpse, while DJ Goo masterfully reworks the loose, bloated
    \x93Optometry\x94 into a crisp slab of inebriated hip-hop on \x93Bomb Massive\x94, replete with decayed synth bursts and a bassline that tops any of Spooky's upright work, topped off by
    sublime beatboxing from IsWhat? member Napolean . Goo's take on \x93Ibid, Desmarches, Ibid\x94 is equally successful at injecting fresh beats under the jazz-bop skin, as is the slow
    Caribbean sleepwalk of Twilight Circus' \x93Variation Cybernetique\x94 remix, which retains the original's gaseous string section. The closer deserves extra props: Animal Crackers' epic, wheels
    of steel raid on \x93Optometry\x94 is a class clown worth getting detention with, or Charlie Brown packing heat.</p><p>
    The most glaring exceptions are easily spotted. The lesser criminals in Colorform craft a jazzy house rave-up from the rib of \x93Sequentia Absentia\x94 that's obviously lost in the wrong neighborhood
    at 2AM. J-Live's contribution is the record's nadir, a tepid vocal track that samples a non-descript snippet of \x93Optometry\x94 and builds an equally faceless song; \x93Asphalt (Tome II)\x94 was one of the
    more feverish moments on <i>Optometry</i>,  but in the hands of Negativland it's a disappointment, a looping afterthought that falls flat.</p><p>
    The credit and blame belongs to all the players, not just the notables: <i>Dubtometry</i>'s greatest mistake is not presenting its contents as an amoebic whole. <i>Optometry</i> sold itself on
    the names of its central contributiors, and the remix album suffers from a serious case of conceptual envy.  But <i>Dubtometry</i> does bring some much-needed swagger to the
    table in the house that Miller and Schipp built: the sometimes stuffy compositions found on the original disc get a kick in the ass and some tongue in the ear, and it's just the sort of stimulation
    that was needed.  Everything's a little less inhibited this time around: be sure and check your drinks.</p></div>"|2386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2386-dubtometry/|6.9|Mark Martelli

    only kind of hip-hop that matters, as if it sets the standards by which all other hip-hop must be measured. Id est, \x93El-P illustrates a life far from the gun-slinging, bitch-humping, 
    rocks-flashing steez of today's mainstream rap artists.\x94  It's condescending and ignorant to frame underground rappers in that way, as if the only thing an underground emcee 
    represents is an alternative to your mainstream.</p><p>
    But what if a rapper bases his entire theme on being underground? Like, say, the super-conscious Pete Miser, nee Pete Ho, who raps from New York via Portland, OR, whose 
    third solo record <i>Radio-Free Brooklyn</i> is tight, has some great moments, and ultimately flips 19 songs about his underground lifestyle? Pete is so underground, he brags about <i>not</i> having Rolls, bitches, hoes, or furs, in lieu of having assloads of friends, love, hope, and \x93karma\x94.  Yes, <i>karma.</i></p><p>
    Of course, it's pretty hard not to sound conscious and underground when your record's sprinkled liberally with the requisite images of war, racism, and the all-encompassing beauty of...
    Central Park: \x93If I had my way I'd stay a week in the park/ Forget about the phone and all the noise/ Shower in the fountain as the next day starts/ Kick it with the little girls and boys.\x94 The title 
    track is a haunting image of Brooklyn after nuclear war, framed as a post-traumatic stress-disordered flashback: \x93I dox92t remember the place I was when the president died, but I recall the 
    falling nuclear rain and burned skies.\x94 Dramatic, yet effective, Miser sets out in his world with an uninhibited emotionalism, though he's not self-indulgent like most emo rappers; rather, he 
    discusses changing his name from \x93Ho\x94 to \x93Miser\x94 as a mechanism to combat racism; he writes a pretty sweet paean to his girl, elsewhere about his love for hip-hop culture, and the city itself. 
    It meshes nicely with the tight production, ladeled by New York, with its easy beats sitting thick in the mix (but beware occasional, cringe-inducing moments of cheesy, straight-funk 
    vibraphones...oy vey).</p><p>
    Miser proves himself a more than capable DJ, burning holes all through the record with his scratching skills. At the beginning of the apocalyptic title track, a sample of birds chirping is violently 
    interrupted by a monstrous explosion; the beats kick in, and we hear someone panting, \x93there's no place like home.\x94 The whole thing lasts about four seconds, but it's a nice touch, and 
    similar moments of creativity are embroidered throughout every song. Frankly, you'd expect a lot less from a man who can put \x93Dido's touring DJ\x94 on his resume. </p><p>
    Ultimately, Pete Miser is a pretty good underground emcee. Unfortunately, in the post-Aesop Rock world, emcees cax92t afford to be anything less than narrative geniuses; at the very least, they 
    have to slay with the sharpness of their flow. And underground emcees can no longer simply ride on their underground-ness-- it's increasingly well known that as a whole, underground (or, to 
    be more specific, independent) emcees rock better skills than mainstream ones: in order to blow minds, an emcee's either gotta have a hook, or innovate with rhymes, skills, or even production. 
    When there are 57 million rappers out there promising they're gonna take it to another level, \x93pretty good underground emcee\x94 doesx92t really help you to stand out from the 
    pack.  From now on, I'm going to describe 50 Cent as \x93an alternative to all the peace-sign-flashing, bike-riding, mind-expanding conscious rappers.\x94</p></div>"|5334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5334-radio-free-brooklyn/|7.2|Julianne Shepherd

Is there any finer sound than a power chord played through a four-track that sounds like it
    was built from Legos?  It's like heroin to me; razorblades, anthrax, whatever-- wrap them in a few layers
    of fuzzed-up guitar and I'll eat it with my breakfast cereal.  For years, Athens, GA stood as the richest
    resource of lo-fi hiss on Earth, but with the rapid expansion of the powerful Elephant 6 conglomerate, who
    controlled the area's supply, the hiss quickly dried up, leaving addicts like myself out in the cold.
    Fortunately, a handful of bands have emerged from E6 unscathed.</p><p>
    
    Elf Power is one of the last remaining bastions of Athens' hiss production, having churned out irresistible
    fuzz-pop since the heady days of 1994.  Now, on <i>Nothing's Going to Happen</i>, this Athens group has
    gotten its Elf Powers over sixteen tracks from all corners of the musical globe.  And not just any songs.
    Great ones.  Songs so near and dear to me that just the thought of having to do without the original
    versions makes me wanna fight.  Naturally, I was a bit concerned as to whether Elf Power could do them
    justice, but the band quickly negated my worries with their trademarked geyser blasts of that precious
    opiate I cannot resist: lo-fi hiss.</p><p>
    
    Out of the massive, monolithic indie stone-drone they've established as their signature sound, the Elves
    have hacked out an incredible array of covers from the most disparate group of names you're likely to see:
    Roky Erickson, Tall Dwarfs (classic lo-fi poppers in their own right), Jesus and Mary Chain (ditto), The...
    Misfits (what?), Bad Brains...  ""B-b-but these songs aren't going to sound like the originals!  They'll be
    butchered!"" some purist vainly cries.  Silence!  When I want your opinion I'll rattle your cage, even if
    you are half-right.  On the surface, it may seem that a great many of these songs would be obscured by
    Elf Power's indie haze, but this is a labor done in earnest; these songs weren't chosen just to be buried.
    Hearing the D.C. hardcore of ""Paid to Cum"" through the light-hearted retro-buzz that only Elf Power can
    supply makes it overwhelmingly clear: the sincerest form of flattery isn't imitation; it's faithful
    interpretation.</p><p>
    
    Despite the exterior differences in mood and instrumentation, everything here is carved from the same Rock,
    and as each track falls sway to Andrew Rieger's emotionally distant croons and wave after wave of acid-washed
    guitar crunch, it becomes evident that the band has accomplished something impressive.  On one hand,
    <i>Nothing's Going to Happen</i> is so universally cohesive that someone unfamiliar with the roots of these
    tracks could be forgiven for mistaking this as an original effort.  The slightly more subdued sound of
    <i>Creatures</i> plays well here, giving the group enough room to keep the acoustics cleaner when it counts
    (check out the bounce-pop of T.Rex's ""Hot Love""), or as muddy as necessary on tracks like the title cut.
    Hell, even the subject matter doesn't stray that far from the trippy psychedelia of their other outings.
    There're no birds with candy-bar heads, but ""Hybrid Moments"", The Frogs' ""Weird on the Avenue"", and Erickson's
    ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (among others) have a distinct oddity that's immediately reminiscent of vintage
    Elfin material.</p><p>
    
    But then, finally getting around to the other hand in this comparison, they never sacrifice the personality
    of the various artists they tackle.  Sure, the adjustment gets a little rough in places-- fans may rankle at
    the sheer absurdity of Rieger's Gary Numan impression on ""My Shadow in Vain"", and four-out-of-five dentists
    didn't believe it, but ""Upside Down"" sounds even lower-fi than ever before.  Fortunately, these slight
    missteps take nothing away from the incredible effort put forth on <i>Nothing's Going to Happen</i>; every
    cut comes away as a singular application of the Elf aesthetic to every sort of music available while keeping
    individuality intact.  Should keep the hiss fiends satisfied for quite a while.</p></div>"|2745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2745-nothings-going-to-happen/|8.1|Eric Carr

    you can read all about this phenomenon, where you wake up to discover you cax92t move, or maybe it's that you're dreaming you cax92t move, and there's something about auditory hallucinations-- 
    actually, I never figured out exactly what it is.  And I'm also not sure why they wrote an entire album about it.</p><p>
    That's just the first puzzle in Dredg's latest full-length.  This California art metal band resembles Tool raised by hippies, encouraged to finger-paint all day.  Veering between ominous 
    dirges and wide-eyed big sky anthems, they play massive art metal that's been treated to multi-layered, intricate production in the vein of Radiohead and Pink Floyd; and for a band that can smash 
    and roil like waves against Pacific beaches, they frequently take the subtler road, softening themselves with atmosphere and world music flourishes.</p><p>
    There's just one problem: <i>El Cielo</i> makes no sense.  I dox92t mean the lyrics or the central concept, which are enough of a Rorschach test to let any devoted fan dig out whatever they 
    want from this album (post-millennial dread, musings on the conflict between the real and the unreal, the active and the paralyzed-- all your favorite themes are here), but the hundred and one 
    ideas thrown onto this record dox92t hang together.  It's too diffuse to match its scope, and all of the influences melt down to a bland sheen.</p><p>
    Although frontman Gavin Hayes could have set the tone here, he's a hard man to read.  Painfully earnest and sounding more assured than on their previous record </p><p>Leitmotif, he's still in an 
    awkward niche: he's too sincere and hopeful to sandpaper our eyes with visions of horror, yet too smooth to let his guard down.  Mostly, he just sounds weird: his lyrics are like getting trapped 
    at a party by a guy who wants to talk about dolphins, or Ralph Nader.  \x93All you need is a modest house in a modest neighborhood/ In a modest town where honest people dwell,\x94 he states at 
    one point, with a naiveté that's neither affected nor effective.  Then wonder fills his voice as he sings, \x93Babies are born/ In the same buildings where people go/ To pass away...pass away.\x94  
    Yes, Gavin.  People die.</p><p>
    You cax92t fault the rest of the band, when they stick to melodic hard rock at least; they nail the punchy clean riffs on \x93Sanzex94, and tracks like \x93Convalescent\x94 and \x93Eighteen People Living in 
    Harmony\x94 burn with the urgency of painting flames on a classic car, but they lose their edge when they soften the mood.  As exotic and svelte as Dredg want to sound, they havex92t found a 
    way to do it without watering down their music.  When they don acoustic guitars, they cax92t help but rip off \x93Paranoid Android\x94; the Latin accents and slower tempos are as authentic 
    as a <i>Zorro</i> movie.</p><p>
    Knowing their limits, they've also dragged a circus of performers onto the record: strings, world musicians like the Iranian-born singer Azam Ali, and, lest I forget, the members of the Los Angeles 
    Master Chorale, who close the album in an almost clichéd finale of hope and uplift.  Dredg integrates some of these varied elements into their songs-- percussionist Greg Ellis may 
    be the sharpest collaboration-- but quarantine others within the five instrumental interludes, subtitled \x93brushstrokes\x94, sticking random fragments of music between the songs. It's 
    these bewildering variety on the edges of the record that give it a taint of mystery and exoticism, complementing that all-purpose metaphor of sleep paralysis.</p><p>
    But cramming all of this stuff together doesx92t mean it adds up to anything: without the material and structure to make use of it, it's just a big multicultural mess.  Dredg has to learn how to harness 
    all of the ideas-- and major label money-- they now bring to these projects, the very things that gave them access to such a wellspring of talent.  Next time, even if they drag in the world music, the 
    choir and everything else, they should start with a concept that's easier to write about, something tangible, something with boundaries.  Concept is only validating if it adds cohesion to your work, 
    if it informs the compositions.  This collection of unrelated experiments could have been anything, and though Dredg claims they're all related somehow, these songs fail to flow together, even as 
    dreams.</p></div>"|2450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2450-el-cielo/|5.6|Chris Dahlen

    Manhattan with Freddie Foxxx, Kool G Rap, Rob Swift, KMD, MF Doom, Dr. Butcher and Roc Raida. Grimm was
    shot <i>ten times</i> (at once) in 1994, an attempt on his life that left him blind, deaf, comatose and
    almost completely paralyzed. Gradually, he was able to regain his sight, hearing, and much movement,
    though presently, he still requires the aid of a wheelchair to get around.</p><p>
    
    In 1995, he started a record
    label called Day by Day Entertainment, which he currently helps run from the Arthur Kill Correctional
    Facility on Staten Island. In the 24 hours before he began serving a life sentence (stemming from
    conspiracy-narcotics charges), he recorded his first and only full-length record, <i>The Downfall of
    Ibliys</i>: a ghetto opera, in its entirety. Though he's still imprisoned, Grimm's label will soon release
    <i>Scars &amp; Memories</i> (a collection of tracks from 1989-1994), which is also the title of the first song
    he wrote after waking from the coma.</p><p>
    
    If that story isn't a testament to the importance of context, then I'm Noam Chomsky. MF Grimm's history
    alone makes <i>Ibliys</i> an imperative listen for both headz and musicologists; even more importantly,
    his vocal inflections are practically flipping over with subtext. When he raps, ""Human life is I/ Forgive
    him, God,"" on the album's thesis track, ""Time and Space"", a slight, cliffhanging, melancholy echo hangs
    on the ""God""; the slow rhythm and piano sample beat like the heart of regret.</p><p>
    
    ""To All My Comrades"" is a
    clipped, grave warning to Grimm's ""fallen comrades"": ""We are greater than dogs/ We are wolves/ They can't
    tell us what to do/ That's why they go to the park/ And we go to the zoo,"" while invoking vivid images of
    slavery, and environmental destruction. ""The hunt is short today,"" he raps. ""My brothers, we are now the
    prey."" Grimm's tight, simple style packs punches. Though sometimes he stumbles, and the overall solid,
    reflective production can stray from its course (which is essentially low-key and filled with curiously
    delicate pianos), each syllable resonates with a cautious intimacy, at the very least.</p><p>
    
    In interviews, Grimm has said that being imprisoned is the closest a person can get to being dead without
    actually dying. So in a way, <i>Downfall</i> consists of Grimm's final words before his ""death,"" which
    lends an added urgency to his delivery (or at least the illusion of such). In another sense, <i>Downfall</i>
    is the tale of Grimm's descent from innocence, Ibliys being the angel who fell from the heavens.  Grimm
    takes the high road out; rather than glorifying his lifestyle, he takes the listener through a narrative
    descent into the underworld, touching on philosophy, love, snitches, and unity, finally ending with the
    uplifting ""Omega"", and its spiritual rays of keyboards, ""meant to close the gap between what is and what
    ought to be."" The story of a human befallen to the missteps of his own choices, both in real life and
    through his art, is age-old and deeply moving.</p></div>"|5256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5256-the-downfall-of-ibliys-a-ghetto-opera/|8.3|Julianne Shepherd

    food.  Seriously, I'd recommend Cuomo Inc. have General Geffen find them a good lawyer immediately, I
    think there's grounds for a lawsuit here.  This shit makes Nerf Herder and Harvey Danger-- monsters of the late-nineties 
    alterna-dial-- seem like veritable founts of originality and pep.</p><p>
<i>Intern hands Mitchum slip of paper, darts out of office covering head.  It reads: ""Rob, The Special Goodness is Weezer drummer 
    Patrick Wilson's side project, it was nearly solo-recorded, with some minor assistance from a guy named Atom Willard.""</i></p><p>
    
    I knew that already, Sarah.  Really, I did, I was just...I was trying to make a point, about how little The Special Goodness 
    deviate from Wilson's formulaic day job.  <i>Land Air Sea</i> doesn't demonstrate this toothsome twosome are capable of much more than 
    Weezer, either in songwriting variance or musical character.  Wilson's vocals impersonate the same schoolboy quiver as Old Man Rivers-- he must 
    do some man-behind-the-curtain understudy work on arena nights when Cuomo only feels like pantomiming.  The songs, meanwhile, take 
    the radical measure of mixing the power with the pop, in the tattooed-riff mode of recent =W=ork, rather than the overdriven-sugar of their 
    black-and-blue early days.</p><p>
    
    Wilson shows he's a firm supporter of Weezer's war against eccentricity by paralleling their descent into guitar-bass-drums hard rock 
    sludge (and needless soloing) on the group's second record; if I didn't know better, I'd think these muddy productions were more future 
    album demos leaked through the pores of Weezer.com.  Wilson-- clearly-- is no threat to the alpha male of his other band's song craft, 
    however, as his approach to this arena rock play-acting never lucks into reminders of past brilliance like ""Keep Fishin'"".</p><p>
    
    Instead he offers lyrics weaker than the economy, and arrangements straighter than Ted Nugent.  Occasional
    fits of catchiness on ""Life Goes By"", ""Inside Your Heart"" and ""Pay No Mind"" are lost amidst the background buzz, and 
    a song with some promise-- ""Day in the Autumn""--  is ruined by obnoxious foibles like Wilson's pronunciation of ""autumn"" 
    with a ""y"" at the front.  ""N.F.A."" (sorry Deadheads, not a Buddy Holly cover) is the most glaring example of what passes for 
    ingenuity with the Special Goodness, the chorus setting joyless ""ba ba bada""s against a snotty ""I'm not fucking around!"" mantra, 
    triumphant in the belief that they're the first band to swear in a pop song.</p><p>
    
    For purposes of contrast, set <i>Land Air Sea</i> up against the side work of Weezer's first defector, Matt Sharp's
    Rentals, whose debut album was a fetishistic new-wave departure from the core organization, compelling enough
    to (I think-- Jesus, it's still there?) hold a place on my disc shelf.  Wilson can't establish an identity of his own apart from

Karma's caught up with him, though,     seizing him with a prolonged fit of generosity which has culminated in <em>Cruel Smile</em>: a full-length     companion to <em>When I Was Cruel</em>, offering a hodgepodge of sketches, elaboration, proposed improvements,     belated amends-- and not least of all, the infamous ""Pt. 1"".  As a prequel, the song isn't exactly <em>The     Matrix Reloaded</em>, but gripping nonetheless: ""Pt. 1"" fleshes out the portrait of the same mysterious     gold-digger (""Why did you travel far abroad/ So you could sleep with strangers?"") whom we last saw elevated     to high society, and causing memorable hisses (""She was selling speedboats at a trade show when he met her"").     All the while, Costello rues his own brutal youth, when he could muster more pungent insults at the drop of     a top hat.</p><p>This stunt aside, the meat of <em>Cruel Smile</em> comes with its remixes, which are plentiful and, refreshingly,     created without the aid of cred-bearing ""name"" guests.  For us rockists who cheered Costello's regression,     the biggest and most pleasant surprise of <em>When I Was Cruel</em> must have been its sophisticated drum     work, some of which bore comparison with Dave Fridmann's <em>Yoshimi</em> stratagems: idiosyncratic mix of     live skins and sampled textures, with cut-up digital fills no human could possibly replicate. If you're     with me on that, you may actually prefer <em>Cruel Smile</em> over the album proper, since it completely     forgoes <em>When I Was Cruel</em>'s few Bacharachian moments (""Tart"", ""My Little Blue Window"") for its     glorious ugly side.</p><p>The new version of ""15 Petals"" is loose and fast, its original Latin beat fuzzed up and defaced with blasts     of horn skronk that wouldn't be out of place on a Frank London project.  ""Spooky Girlfriend"", recorded live     at KFOG, has about four drum machines going at the same time (one in reverse), and adds cavernous reverb to     Costello's cracked vocal. This ""Spooky Girlfriend"" is noticeably sexier; Costello has suggested Destiny's     Child should cover it, adding, ""I could see why they wouldn't want to, though.""  Given that old racial-slur     incident (from his cruel days) which I'm in no mood to reiterate, this may have been a bit of a risky quip     for Elvis, but this version makes me think he might have meant it in earnest.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the remix front, ""Honeyhouse"" is a loungy incarnation of ""When I Was Cruel, Pt. 2"", sorely     missing the hypnotic looped yelp that drives the original. ""Revolution Doll"", naturally, is a gutted ""Tear     Off Your Own Head (It's a Doll Revolution)"". ""Peroxide Side"", in turn, remakes ""Episode of Blonde"",     mercifully preserving one of the best lyrical insults of Costello's career: ""She had the attention span     of warm cellophane.""</p>
<p>And then, there are the bonuses. There's a new studio cut (""Oh Well"", conveniently describing my reaction     to it), and a live rendition of ""Uncomplicated"" from <em>Blood &amp; Chocolate</em>. Live chestnuts from the     tour, which mark the closest <em>Cruel Smile</em> comes to padding, include ""Almost Blue"" and ""Watching the     Detectives""-- and that, you must admit, is pretty good padding. Two versions of Charles Chaplin's ""Smile""     serve as superfluous bookends. Shit, there's even a hidden track that I discovered minutes ago during the     obligatory while-reviewing spin! The highest achievement for any comp is standalone status, a shelf-life     unshackled from the source. It won't happen to <em>Cruel Smile</em>, but as footnotes go, this one would make     David Foster Wallace proud.</p>

It's not every day that a reunion becomes a full-blown second phase for a band's career, but that seems to be what's happening 
    with this old Australian outfit, even if principle songwriters Grant McLennan and Robert Forster are the only original members back in the fold.  2000's <i>Friends of Rachel Worth</i> found the 
    duo picking up pretty much where the Go-Betweens left off in 1988, back when they were a steady five-piece operating far from their Brisbane home, in London, to massive critical acclaim 
    and microscopic album sales.  The post-punk charge that found its way into some of the band's early recordings is all but gone; the band focuses almost all of <i>Bright 
    Yellow Bright Orange</i> (their eighth full-length) on their acoustic, folk-inflected side.</p><p>
    It's not an entirely bad thing: the mellow material seems to suit the band now that they're older, and gives the spotlight to their melodic craft, which hasn't diminished a bit 
    over time.  Ultimately, McLennan gets the better half of it, as his voice hasn't deteriorated much over the years; Forster, however, has trouble holding up his end.  In fact, Forster's best 
    moments on the album are those where the quality of the melody simply overwhelms his shaky, awkward vocals, a la Dylan in the days before he had a backing 
    band.  Case in point is the loping \x93Too Much of One Thing\x94,  with its strummed verses and barely-there drumming, where his phrasing is less than precise, but still comes 
    off melodically strong.  McLennan puts in his two cents on some smoothly crooned, wordless interjections, making the contrast between the two vocalists all the more obvious.</p><p>
    Opener \x93Caroline &amp; I\x94 sounds great coming out of the gates, with a thick, though basic arrangement and a good performance from Forster, also fantastic on his best contribution, the 
    propulsive \x93Make Her Day\x94, whose subtle keyboard countermelodies lead to ascendant choruses.  But in moments, Forster is a complete disaster, like on \x93Something for Myself\x94, 
    which sounds half-written and limp, with a completely unnatural synthesis of melody and lyrics, including onerous, would-be humorous lines like \x93Want to get out of folk/ and get 
    into rare groove.\x94</p><p>
    McLennan, by contrast, can't seem to make a wrong step: he's positively ebullient on \x93Poison in the Wall\x94, where he bookends his excellent verse with big guitar hooks and a chorus that'll 
    vertically envelop you faster than the 82nd Airborne.  He pulls things back for \x93Mrs. Morgax94 and \x93Crooked Lines\x94, two richly strummed ballads that rank among the album's best tracks.  His 
    best, though, is \x93Old Mexico\x94, a thoroughly lush pop song with a swaggering, staccato guitar riff in the verses and a huge, swirling chorus full of harmonies and cascading keyboards.</p><p>
    For its excellent high points, there's just something about <i>Bright Yellow Bright Orange</i> that's less than fully satisfying.  Obviously, Forster's less inspired moments 
    are mostly to blame, but there's also a certain lack of invention in a lot of the material that's a bit disappointing.  Ultimately, I'm glad the Go-Betweens have decided to stick it out, because 
    they're still making some great songs, but their best material is definitely behind them, on classic albums like <i>Spring Hill Fair</i> and <i>Before Hollywood</i>.  Their latest album is 
    certainly going to please old fans, but with their touted back catalog recently reissued, newcomers would probably be best off heading to their early records first.</p></div>"|3476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3476-bright-yellow-bright-orange/|6.9|Joe Tangari

By this I mean when bands genuinely
    change: not when they ""mature"" or when they ""incorporate subtle electronic flourishes,"" but when they actually
    surprise you, popping up like friends who've been gone for years and reappear with bold new haircuts.</p><p>
    
    Adult. have pretty much changed. Their twelve-inch records so far-- most of them collected on the
    <i>Resuscitation</i> CD-- have been stocked with some of the buzziest, punkiest electro going, as well as
    some of the hookiest: their nervous strobelight grind couldn't have been any less opposed to the pop
    sensibility it was standing on. Their last single, a happily shouty bouncer called ""Don't Stop"", had at
    least a few of us expecting their first proper album to be some sort of fine-tuned pop breakthrough. And
    it is, but not nearly in the way you'd think.</p><p>
    
    The definitive departure here comes on a track called ""Glue Your Eyelids Together"", which you can tell is
    sort of a mission statement when you notice the picture in the liners of Adam Lee Miller and Nicola Kuperus
    doing exactly that. Look carefully: Miller's bottle of Elmer's is rebranded Ersatz Audio. And then listen
    as casually as you want, and you'll still notice that Miller is now playing bass.</p><p>
    
    Right: everyone's always called them ""punks"", and now they're living up to it by being post-punks. The drum
    machine, previously popping forcefully in the center of the mix, now blurts and snaps from one corner of a
    very large room. Somewhere closer is Miller, charging sharply around on a massively fuzzed-up bassline. And
    right there in our collective face, her taunting chant no longer processed into tech-land, is Kuperus,
    bouncing and cheerleading: ""Glue your eyelids together!  Glue your eyelids together!""</p><p>
    
    This time the ""post-punk"" isn't a metaphor. The sound has plenty to do with what happened when the artier
    punks of the late 70s started messing with synths, like a hyper child's redrawing of Cabaret Voltaire's
    ""Nag Nag Nag""-- and a little to do with the evil-techie buzz that's come out of the Pacific Northwest more
    recently (see: Mocket's ""Monitress""). And like a lot of the best post-punk, this is going to sound like a
    great shoddy mess to a whole lot of people: just the raw pulse of a four-note bass slice, punchy synth
    exclamations, needling sneers from Kuperus, and a great big slap of a snare drum keeping pace. It will
    provoke hatred and eye-rolling and accusations of soulless charlatanism, and at least one acquaintance has
    declared it ""the most annoying thing ever recorded."" But it's also terrifically, needlingly catchy, bratty
    fist-in-the-air catchy: in its best moments it sounds like Joy Division having a panic attack.</p><p>
    
    Which is, of course, Adult.'s whole business: <i>Anxiety Always</i>, it's called, and there's even more
    jittery, spazzy insistence here than on those twelve-inches. There's also more of the deeper, more ominous
    exploration that filled some of those records' b-sides: the album creeps ominously in on the instrumental
    swell of ""The Cold Call"", and its second half opens equally slowly, repeating, tangling, and rearranging
    one line: ""People: you can confuse them.../ Into a disorienting babble.""</p><p>
    
    There's also something of the Adult. of old, only the hyper-precise turnarounds are subdued into a careful
    trance: ""Shake Your Head"" bubbles and flutters with dangerous purpose, and ""Kick in the Shin""-- pictured on
    rear CD tray-- has an almost-smooth gloss on its deep electro, with Kuperus very nearly crooning over it.
    The rigidly groovy pop of ""Don't Stop"" comes back on another high point, ""Nothing of the Kind"", which is
    filled with a weird, scratchy twang that makes you imagine Miller wearing a cowboy hat as he plays its
    treble-heavy bassline. The big field trips come on ""We Know How to Have Fun"", a blurry, murky void you can
    spend hours parsing, and the new ""Nervous (Wreck)"", a complex and evil-sounding instrumental that feels
    like the soundtrack to an old video game about werewolves.</p><p>
    
    But we're also gluing our eyelids together, and from there it escalates. ""Blank Eyed, Nose Bleed"" wraps its
    synths' brittle zapping with another paranoid cheer: ""I've been working on increasing my anxiety!"" Here I
    should remind you that Adult. really do have a sense of humor. Remembering this may be necessary to get
    through ""Turn Your Back""-- which is not to say that they're joking, but Kuperus is going to go ""neh neh neh""
    at you, and you're going to want to be on her side when it happens.</p><p>
    
    Because that's the sort of wonderful change this is: a high-wire hop, the kind of shift that tries to walk
    fearlessly onto a patch of ground surrounded by pitfalls. It's tempting to call it one of the most messily
    brilliant things we'll see all year, but it can't, in good faith, be recommended to everyone: if the duo's
    buzzy neurosis was enough to drive some people nuts before, the raw jumping and nagging of <i>Anxiety Always</i>
    will sound to many like the shoddiest, most amusical sham to be held up as a masterpiece in many of our lives.
    No joke: this album would annoy all hell out of some of you, would sound like everything cruel about music
    wrapped into a single package whose creators seem actively proud that they couldn't care less. But if you're
    at all ready to run with it, you might find yourself in one of the more fun positions music lovers can get
    into: wondering for ten minutes whether you're hearing an embarrassing wreck or a stroke of genius, and then
    realizing in an ecstatic flash that it is so the latter.</p></div>"|56.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/56-anxiety-always/|7.9|Nitsuh Abebe

His 2001 debut for the Leaf label, <em>Start Breaking My Heart</em>, was blissed-out pastoral IDM that warranted Boards of Canada comparisons.  Then he went off and made some clubby tracks that dabbled in UK garage.  And now, with his second full-length <em>Up in Flames</em>, he's chucked the laptop, dug the analog gear out of the dumpster, and recorded a 60s-worshiping indie pop record, complete with sun-kissed harmonies, layered acoustic guitars, Farfisa organ drones and glockenspiel.  You have to admire the chutzpah.  Seriously, I can't remember hearing this stark a contrast between consecutive albums in a long time, maybe ever.</p><p>  The sound of <em>Up in Flames</em> is key.  In contrast to the world of modern computer-based music, where noise is precisely controlled and each layered instrument can be mentally plucked from the mix and examined, <em>Up in Flames</em> is a colossal field of unified sound.  The sheets of acoustic guitar and organ wrap themselves around the booming drums (mostly acoustic kits tuned to the full timbre of the Hal Blaine era) and you can't pry them apart.  The obvious production inspirations are Phil Spector and Brian Wilson, both of whom arranged songs during a time when men had more ideas than available tracks; producers were forced to cheat in those days-- to bounce and to compress-- and the best records to come out of that period were massive and unknowable as a result.  <em>Up in Flames</em>, whether by choice or necessity, has the same warm feeling of ramshackle Wagner.  When it came time to record, precision was clearly a goal far down the list.</p><p>  Despite their obvious 60s references, most of the tracks on <em>Up in Flames</em> aren't really songs in the traditional sense.  Instead of prominent verse/chorus/bridge structures, we hear a series of swells and contractions.  Snaith has a good understanding of the tricks and techniques of pop's biggest and best moments, the moments that stop your breath during the pause just before the big chorus, and he set out to make an album filled with them.  ""Hendrix with Ko"" (which is one of a couple songs featuring the voice of Koushik Ghosh) has some lyrics, but most of what you hear are just day-glo bah-bah-bah's that serve as suspension cabling to carry the track from one section to the next, through the Mamas &amp; Papas homage to an electronic coda that's a rare memory of Manitoba's prior incarnation.  ""Jacknuggeted"" has a similar arc, but reminds me more of Neil Diamond in his Bang Records days-- all ""Cherry Cherry"" handclaps and stiff-but-funky D/A/G acoustic strumming-- before another digital breakdown brings in sputtering breaks that would have had Greenwich &amp; Barry lunging for the ""stop"" button.</p><p>  As tied to the 60s as it is, <em>Up in Flames</em> can also be described as ""psychedelic.""  The way the absolutely huge ""Bijoux"" swirls with Wilsonian harmonies, layers of chords, music boxes, percussion explosions and orchestral samples, I swear it almost takes on a Boredoms cast-- not in terms of aggression, but as a primal celebration of the possibility of sound.  ""Kid You'll Move Mountains"" is similarly dense, but this one sends a snaking soprano saxophone through the changes.  A tenor sax erupts in the latter part of ""Skunks"", tearing off into a series of riffs that add the same sort of ""free"" element to the track that Stereolab incorporated into ""Fuses"".  The fuzzy ""Crayon"", meanwhile, sounds like Múm covering The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's ""Taste of Cindy"".</p><p>  If Snaith were to follow the trend of most electronic producers, he'd have changed his alias for this project, the way Atom Heart does with Señor Coconut-- though I'll grant that there's some conceptual overlap: <em>Up in Flames</em> certainly has a wide-eyed and affirmative outlook, and features titles like ""Every Time She Turns Around It's Her Birthday"" to go with <em>Start Breaking My Heart</em>'s ""Children Play Well Together"", and there are a few brief moments where Snaith's IDM head pops out of the fabric.  But that's as far as it goes; the two albums aren't in the same universe.  Is Snaith confused?  Maybe he wants it all.  Maybe he doesn't know <em>what</em> he wants.  But because <em>Up in Flames</em> is such a great record, we win either way.</p><p> </p></div>"|5077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5077-up-in-flames/|8.6|Mark Richardson

Yeah, you, holding a copy of <i>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</i> with an <i>Adaptation</i>
    ticket stub for a bookmark.  You're obviously hip to the new sensation sweeping the nation: meta-fiction!
    Maurice the Meta-fiction Moose defines the genre as ""post-modern art conscious of and reveling in its own
    limitations"" and it's in full bloom everywhere from the bookstore to the Cineplex, with TV-show characters
    talking to the camera in-between.  Hell, even record reviews do it-- I crafted a densely mirrored concept
    review around this latest release from Cursive, but it turned out to be too pretentious for prime-time
    (watch for it in my forthcoming collection of short stories about famous Omahaians).</p><p>
    
    One media form yet to be infiltrated by the gimmick of self-reference, however, is music, partly because it's
    more than a little difficult to do in a three-minute pop song, and partly because Jon Spencer ruined it for
    everybody.  But Cursive frontman Kasher is willing to give it the old college try on <i>The Ugly Organ</i>,
    and somehow manages to do it with a minimum of pretension while simultaneously livening up the crusted emo
    messenger bag.</p><p>
    
    Cursive is no stranger to the concept album; their last full-length, <i>Domestica</i>, was a song-cycle dealing
    with the critical entropy of a dying marriage, and its warm reception seems to have motivated Kasher to stay
    in the storyteller role.  The ""plot"" of <i>The Ugly Organ</i>, such as it is, revolves around loose themes of
    fallout remorse and hollow sexual meandering, the latter summed up in the double meaning of the album title.
    Appropriately, then, recurring organ figures occasionally torment Kasher's protagonist mid-song, while
    recent Cursive recruit Gretta Cohn's cello grants everything the epic quality it so desperately calls for.</p><p>
    
    The material fueled by this concept is pretty easy to spot, bearing woe-packed titles like ""The Recluse"",
    ""Driftwood"", or ""Bloody Murderer"", and aside from the occasional Diaryland line (""My ego's like my stomach/
    It keeps shitting what I feed it""), it's a solid record for those without severe emo allergies.  ""The
    Recluse"" is melancholy and full of ornate note flurries like early Joan of Arc, and the eerie ""Driftwood""
    creeps along like ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" beneath Cohn's bowed swooshes.</p><p>
    
    An entire LP of this slumped-shoulder soul-searching would get pretty tired, however; a fact that even
    Kasher seemed to realize as he browsed back over the sad-sack lyrics he'd penned.  Enter the meta: a handful
    of songs wherein Kasher either ups the self-loathing ante by both expressing his sadness and further
    expressing his sadness about his sadness, or brilliantly anticipates the kneejerk reactions of the
    emo-phobic critical community (not here, of course, no, never!).</p><p>
    
    Opening the album with the couplet, ""And now we proudly present/ Songs perverse and songs of lament,"" Kasher
    makes a habit of anticipating the snide commentary of his hatas and beating them to the punch.  ""Art Is Hard""
    assails his own band with the biting stab ""cut it out/ Your self inflicted pain/ Is getting too routine/ The
    crowds are catching on/ To the self-inflicted song,"" and he styles ""Butcher the Song"" ambiguously enough to
    make vain critics betcha think he's talking about them, don't we, don't we: ""I'm writing songs to entertain/
    But these people, they just want pain.""</p><p>
    
    Wisely, Kasher also attaches these masochistic episodes to the strongest songs of the album: ""Red Handed
    Slight of Hand"" being all raw anthem like Desaparecidos without the limited understanding of the geopolitical
    landscape, and ""Art Is Hard"" using Cohn to her fullest as the rest of the band emulates her fierce bowing
    while she rips out a buzzsaw melody like a Dick Dale cello composition.  Even ""Butcher the Song"" which turns
    on a sour riff repeated ad nauseam, has a sort of, well, nauseating effect that emphasizes the self-sickened
    words.</p><p>
    
    With the strength of the meta-emo material, plus ""The Recluse"" and ""Driftwood"", occupying the first half of
    the album, it's easy to get caught up in <i>The Ugly Organ</i>'s bold aims.  Unfortunately, the album is too
    top-heavy to be seaworthy, the back end full of Fugazi knockoffs and half a song stretched out to ten minutes
    in a forced attempt at a showstopping finale (""Staying Alive""-- they'd be better off with a Bee Gees cover).
    The fact that Kasher, in a toe-dipping test of this meta stuff, already called himself out as a Mackaye
    acolyte on Cursive's last EP can't save the likes of ""Sierra"" and ""Gentleman Caller"" from my seen-it-all
    scorn.  Bah.</p><p>
    
    Still, a solid side A is enough to make <i>The Ugly Organ</i> an emo album (gasp!) on Saddle Creek (yipes!)
    that I'm not ashamed to admit a conditional liking for.  Should Kasher decide to continue along the concept
    album path, it would perhaps do him good to study himself some Pedro the Lion-- and he might want to steer
    clear of the meta from here on out-- I hear from New York that unironic is the new ironic.  But for twenty
    minutes of <i>The Ugly Organ</i>, what he's got now is enough to make an idea that sounds, on paper, a
    million ways wrong and a shoo-in for Most Self-Indulgent Album of the Year work reasonably well.  Here's
    hoping he draws someone less homely than Nicholas Cage for the film version.</p></div>"|1698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1698-the-ugly-organ/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

    until their feet are bloody stumps. Or they pack their one bag then forget
    to run at all, as if mired deep to the knees in a Southern Gothic dream.</p><p>
    
    The Baptist Generals have been recording in one form or another since 1998.
    <i>No Silver/No Gold</i>, their debut LP for Sub Pop, is hinged together
    with a claustrophobic insularity I remember detailed so fully on The Grifters'
    brilliant <i>One Sock Missing</i>, and rarely after that. The music is fragile
    and spiritual, sodden and boisterous. It's as if the players are seeking out
    loosely sewn faultlines while trying to balance decay and redemption and to
    escape a permanent rupture in either direction.</p><p>
    
    Recorded on an eight-track in someone's garage, the album begins sparely with
    ""Ay Distress"", a hobo spiritual showcasing Chris Flemmons' cracked-up voice.
    His is the pained screech of an outsider, one who seemingly doesn't give a
    fuck about hitting notes, who instead plows around, and through his bastardized
    ABC's, still somehow gets the thing right, wrapping every fragment in a godly
    mist of tangled, slipshod estrangement. While reminiscent of the chirping yowls
    of Refrigerator's Allen Callaci, the closest analogue is Roky Erickson's
    post-breakdown solo recordings. And that's high praise.</p><p>
    
    ""Ay Distress"" shares the 3:00 a.m. bedroom vibe of Refrigerator's ""One of
    Everything"", the lovely opener on 1996's <i>Anchors of Bleed</i>. Here, in
    Flemmons' calloused hands, it's a lullaby to one who continually misses
    the song in their heart. Flemmons nails the words as they fall and spit
    and piss around him, but when he reaches the near-end of the rhyme, his
    cellphone starts singing, too. This interruption breaks the spell, pushing
    him into a series of real-life histrionics: extremely frustrated shouts of
    'goddamn it' and 'oh-h-h-h god' (I imagine him rolling his eyes to an empty
    heaven).  And then he throws the phone or some other inanimate junk and
    finally, before the tape's cut, he smashes himself against a door. Though
    it isn't the best way to end a lullaby, the next track, ""Alcohol (Turn &amp;
    Fall)"", offers a solution for falling asleep when large men are tossing
    themselves against walls around you: turn off the light, get drunk, sweat
    it out.</p><p>
    
    There are so many good songs here, and each is difficult to recount by
    quoting lyrics or offering descriptions of certain elements. Though it's
    Flemmons' croon that strikes you initially, the band playing with him is
    equally dead-on: guitars sound like they're being snapped, the drums are
    shaggy-dog and really fuzzy.  There seem to be buzzsaws, and the keyboards,
    slide guitar, and theremin are always somewhere in the distance catching
    breaths before chiming loudly into the general mess. The songs threaten
    to blow out your speakers purely with melancholy and anger.</p><p>
    
    The Baptist Generals seem to know you can't ever really return to some
    cleaned-up state. And, really, most of us are too poor to afford simulated
    perfection anyhow. So you learn to deal with your injuries, make sure
    they're accounted for, and if you're lucky then you find some powerful and
    pure way to express the things that are most fucked.</p></div>"|11661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11661-no-silverno-gold/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

    extension that the Dutch group's albums are equally interchangeable, showing little deviation from the
    art-jangle formula established by the Betties' classic 1992 debut <em>Palomine</em>.  Sure, that album was
    a college-radio smash, and along with Pavement, Liz Phair and Yo La Tengo, the band helped cement Matador's
    early-90s rep as the premiere purveyor of wiseassed, wide-eyed indie rock.</p><p>
    But it's pretty clear, with a career now spanning ten years and five studio albums, that Bettie Serveert
    have remained truer to their original mission statement than their colleagues, and their albums, released
    like clockwork every two years or so, have always reflected that self-imposed aesthetic dogma.  The band
    does what they do, and nothing more-- they've never made us suffer through a concept album or a period
    piece, and we thank them for that.</p><p>
    Their last outing, 2000's <em>Private Suit</em>, attempted to recapture their Matador-era momentum by reuniting
    de Artsen drummer Reiner Veldman with his former bandmates, and hiring ace PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish
    to produce.  Still, something was amiss: <em>Private Suit</em>'s forays into orchestral pop-- the strings, the
    jazz-brush percussion, the melodies nicked from ABBA-- were far more convincing than the rockers, which lacked
    the garage-y punch and snarling feedback that made the band so charming in the first place.  In the year of
    Modest Mouse, Sigur Rós and <em>Kid A</em>, Bettie Serveert never felt so quaint.</p><p>
    Well, it must be time to change the batteries in the smoke detector and clean the guns, because here come
    Bettie Serveert once more with <em>Log 22</em>-- an album that might be considered ""transitional,"" if the
    band are dead-set on becoming a band that completely suck.  With a bloated 60+ minute runtime and some
    truly misguided dabblings with e-bows and saxophones, <em>Log 22</em> presents Bettie Serveert at their most
    self-indulgent.  And it's not pretty.</p><p>
    The distraction of singer Carol van Dyk's myriad side projects is partially to blame-- Chitlin Fooks'
    Stoffel Verlackt drums, plays bass, and arranges horns on <em>Log 22</em>, and Fooks/Shadowgraphic City
    frontman Pascal Deweze has a vocal cameo.  Jeroen Blankert (of improvisational jazz-punkers Munzruh)
    replaces the more versatile Veldman behind the drumkit; even longtime bassist Herman Bunskoeke is pushed
    aside for a good third of the album, leaving guitarist Peter Visser and van Dyk to go Dutch with most of
    the songwriting.  The personnel changes and risky, overly ambitious material, in conjunction with Visser's
    decision to produce the album himself, result in an album that is most generously described as ""random.""</p><p>
<em>Log 22</em> is sporadically peppered with the five-to-eight minute epics that characterized the <em>Lamprey</em>
    period and the shorter, half-baked pop confections that padded <em>Dust Bunnies</em>.  In the latter category,
    there's ""Not Coming Down"", an overdriven two-minute sketch that barely sticks around long enough to register
    a melody that features a vague slipstream of lyrical non-sequiturs.  Or the overly aggressive ""Smack"", typical
    of the everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink production-- a knotty clusterfuck of sampled whistling, stuttered
    percussion, noise, and three dueling layers of van Dyk's amped-up vocals.</p><p>
    But the album's most egregious sins are, not coincidentally, its most adventurous.  Take the bleating,
    maudlin ""Have a Heart"", which contains the lyrics, ""Can we synchronize our souls?"" and, ""Life can be so
    easy, like tonguing candy out your molars"" (yuck?) and devolves in a brassy din of sax solos.  The treacly
    ""Captain of Maybe"" pits the spacy wail of an e-bow against vaguely nautical flute-like synths and discordant
    sine waves undulating in and out of the mix as van Dyk sing-drones stream-of-consciousness dreck like, ""I'm
    drawing a circle on this invisible map of our lives, placing thumbtacks on all the dreams we've ever had.""</p><p>
    Even potentially good songs are pulled under by poor aesthetic choices: the meandering, overly arty verses
    of opener ""Wide-Eyed Fools"", for instance, seem grafted from a completely different song than the explosive,
    satisfying choruses.  The band's simply not wound tight enough to pull it off.  Likewise with the eight-minute-plus
    ""White Dogs"", which begins promisingly by segueing from a chamber-pop prologue into a chugging, Velvets-style
    groove, but van Dyk's vocals and the drumming feel overly mannered, especially in this halcyon age of Interpols
    and Strokes.  Oh, by the way, that one ends with a sax solo, too.</p><p>
    If you still think all Bettie Serveert songs sound alike, or still cling to <em>Palomine</em> like a fraying
    security blanket, look no further than ""De Diva"", exactly the kind of wordy, pleasant-enough slow-burner
    that recalls those halcyon early 90s, sans-freshness.  Likewise with ""Cut 'n' Dried"", a new recording of
    a <em>Private Suit</em>-era song with a thick syrup of strings, jazzy drums and drunken piano that sounds,
    well, just like an outtake from <em>Private Suit</em>.</p><p>
    On the other hand, Bettie Serveert make a few departures so radical they're barely recognizable at all:
    ""Certainlie"", a torchy duet with Chitlin Fooks' Deweze, hails from the same mediocre prom-song planet as
    that Sarah Shannon solo album.  The jammy, vaguely U2-ish sketch ""Given"" sucks six minutes from your life
    with little more than a five-note melody and a go-nowhere drumbeat.  But <em>Log 22</em>'s most shocking left
    turn comes with album closer ""The Love-In"", a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of Shania Twain and ""Lovefool""-era
    Cardigans with Visser chugging away on a wah pedal like he's auditioning for Austin Powers' backup band.
    This is precisely the type of drivel that could end up on the bestselling soundtrack to some Adam Sandler
    vehicle and become Bettie Serveert's Big Hit Single, to be begrudgingly played in encores for decades of
    grueling reunion tours.</p><p>
    ""Don't try to fix a thing that isn't broke,"" van Dyk sings in ""De Diva"", and it'd be nice if she'd follow
    her own advice.  Though their relevance has clearly faded over the years, the once-dependable indie warhorses
    of Bettie Serveert have finally delivered an out-and-out turkey, simply by not being themselves.  At their
    loosest and most rules-free (circa <em>Lamprey</em>, let's say), Bettie Serveert's energy can be infectious,
    liberating; here they just come off as underpracticed and unfocused.  At best, <em>Log 22</em> is acceptable--
    at its worst, unlistenable.  Anybody got a match?</p></div>"|674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/674-log-22/|2.9|Will Bryant

    Opening sequence: Our hero, as a pimply-faced adolescent, sneaks off to smoke a roach of genuine
    Mexi-creeper weed between class periods, and the effects of it hit just as he stumbles back into the
    Ronald Reagan Memorial Gymnasium in time for the all-blond and tanned rich kid pep rally featuring
    gridiron heroes with last-name-first names like Hunter and Preston. He has a pair of headphones strapped
    on (cue Butthole Surfers' ""Kuntz"") and as he gazes upon the lipstick-smeared rictuses of the anorexic
    cheerleaders doing the splits and fisting the air, the cosmic conspiracy overwhelms him, and he sees
    that his entire life has led up to this moment.</p><p>
    
    Flashback fade-in with vaseline-smeared lens: Our disaffected young hero sits in Ms. Walthall's homeroom
    at Alamo Heights Junior High, boldly asking intimate questions about her son Paul Leary's band.</p><p>
    
    Hero: ""Wait, wasn't their first album really called <i>A Brown Reason to Live</i>? Whose peepees are those
    on the cover anyhow? And do you pronounce the live EP they did as <i>PCP-Pep</i>, as the other kids on the
    playground call it, or is that just a peepee joke, too?</p><p>
    
    Ms. Walthall: [her bottom lip trembling] ""Never mention that awful band's name again!"" Our hero is held
    back for yet another year.</p><p>
    
    Scene Thirty-Seven: An awkward punk rock girl finds her way to a back house tucked off of the hoity-toity
    Geneseo Drive in an exclusive oil-money neighborhood, and makes her way into a packed room with these two
    accounting school dorks from Trinity clamoring.</p><p>
    
    Band: [screaming] ""There's a time to fuck and a time to crave, but the Shah sleeps in Lee Harvey's grave!!!""</p><p>
    
    [Note: Guitars are to played with the members' dicks as slides, and the singer is to pour lighter fluid
    over crash cymbals and then light them on fire as he hits it, threatening to bring everything down in an
    obnoxious blaze of glory.]</p><p>
    
    Everybody: [shouting in homage to the acid casualty crying on the first version] ""Shut up! Shut up! Shut
    the FUCK UP!""</p><p>
    
    [Her voiceover: ""These guys fucking suck, they'll never make it out of San Antonio, especially with a name
    like that.""]</p><p>
    
    Interlude: The dialogue is in muffled Spanish, but we can make out a young boy being consoled by El Santo,
    breathing heavily through his famous silver wrestling mask as he tickles his little wee-wee. ""Get your hands
    off me, Hey!"" is the only line in English that can be made out of the black-and-white mess. But if you hit
    pause and look in the background, as legend has it, you can even make out The Donkey Man himself, splayed
    on a picnic table, recreating the infamous Donkey Show from down in Juarez.</p><p>
    
    Scene Sixty-Nine: Sneaking through the back entrance, Long-Haired Dude #4 gets to experience the Butthole
    Surfers in the flesh. They only have one album on the Dead Kennedys' label, and so most of it gets rehashed
    live, with far more smoke, strobe lights, surgically scarred titties, and mayhem than could ever be deemed
    tolerable by the Motion Picture Association of America. It's less Saturday morning cartoon and more psychotic
    goons in shit-stained cut-offs than the record would ever let on. There's even a saxophone played by a guy
    with smoke rising up through his shocked-up hairdo. Gibby Haynes, at nearly seven feet, shirtless, swinging
    about a shotgun, sounds less like Foghorn Leghorn 'n' Yosemite Sam's brood in person, and more like a
    speed-gobbling car mechanic with Gein-sized meat chunks packed in the back of the rusty pick-up. After a
    particularly blatting, Byzantine meltdown of ""Something"" (its second appearance in the film) he even gets
    a small speaking part.</p><p>
    
    Gibby: ""Alright, we managed to clear out a lot of the people. Lookit that, these shit's are going home right
    now. [Pause] You fucks. Hope you get to work on time.""</p><p>
    
    [Note: Original edit of film contained only seven live songs, now expanded to nine, including an insipid
    number thankfully left off of any other recorded document: ""Matchstick"".]</p><p>
    
    Scene Eighty-Three: Chewing on a thick wad of the brown acid, our hero is standing at a Butthole Surfers
    concert many years in the future when they're really great, as they play on the Sonic Butt-Fire Tour
    (including Sonic Youth and Firehose). Nearing the menacing portal of Acid Candyland, his body dangling
    like a jellyfish, his buddy taps him on the shoulder and makes him focus on a particularly gruesome penile
    reconstruction film playing behind the band.</p><p>
    
    Hero: [mumbles incoherently] Jack Ruby slippers! You can never go home again! [Has flash vision of both
    River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain meeting their demise after coming into contact with Gibby Haynes, goes
    insane.]</p><p>
    
    Cue yet another fucking version of ""Something"" (this time a demo) as end credits roll.</p></div>"|11689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11689-butthole-surferslive-pcppep/|6.2|Andy Beta

This isn't to say that there aren't hundreds of female singers from the Far East who don't possess a somewhat more powerful caterwaul-- some of their bands are even in the archive, check Gaji and Koenjihyakkei for starters-- but I get the distinct impression Japanese record companies believe Barbie-toned girls are what we want.  And you
    know, who's to say they're wrong?  Cute is as cute squeaks, no?  The only problem comes when you realize that not only do all these bands cause hearing damage after more than three songs, it just feels...like I'm perpetuating some old Japanese dude's ingrained sexism by buying into those voices.</p><p>n And before the Oprah Brigade chimes in, yes, I realize that me looking for sexism in what is, by all accounts, shiny, fun, golden sound is probably a sexist move on my part.  Above all, it helps that bands like Deerhoof and Melt Banana sound so completely in their own world that only the most callous East Coast scenesters could reduce them to pop-culture gimmicks.  In a perfect world, nobody would ever look for hidden catches (and other excuses to feel guilty about liking their music), but to these bands' credit, what stereotypes they might prompt are rendered almost sterile by their enthusiasm and originality.</p><p>n So, without further ado, I introduce yet another band to add to the pile: Okinawa's Salk Vacchin.  Rubber ducky voices: check.  Short, Casio-dominated  songs: check.  Full of spunk and quirk and a lot of other words ending in k: check.  Despite all of that, have you heard this record before?  Not really.  Even a little?  Well, maybe if you heard some of that Picky Picnic record I wrote about in Pitchfork's Found Sound 2002 feature  (and if you did, where's that $200 French LP of bathroom sink murders you said you were sending me?).  This trio, produced by cross-dressing Svengali of the avant-garde Hoppy Kamiyama, comes on like the technophile obsessed Yellow Magic Orchestra, if they hadn't the budget for anything but homemade  demos detailing a fascination with hill people and sugar substitutes.</p><p>n ""Sable Tour"" waltzes out of the gate with the crash and rumble of an ultra-fake snare drum roll.  The trio (Saeko Maesato, Megumi Maesato and Kiroko Gima) repeats a chant (in Japanese, except for a whole bunch of ""yeah yeah yeahs"") while bells fall down stairwells and dime store electro brings the pep like cotton on candy.  And it's not that they sound sweet, necessarily, but there is a certain innocence at work, as if these people would be making this stuff regardless of whether an audience was out there or not.  ""Maltese World"" takes the waltz feel into the lullaby realm; the singers perform a mini-canon with flutes and piano-- and I swear my Mom bought me that keyboard when I was 15.</p><p>n The more energetic stuff tends to fall closer in line with ""traditional"" Japanese dadaist-rock.  ""Saccharin"" is maniac disco-trance, featuring non-stop chatter from the singers, one of them always making sure to occupy the high-range hiccup parts.  The title track crams in three or four beginner level piano etudes, some session funk bass, robotic pogo-vocals and just enough DIY post-punk ineptitude to qualify as some kind of shock therapy for feyer-than-thou Soft Cell fans.  As for ""Monsieur Hee Hoo"", it merely sounds like Boredoms genetically re-engineered as the Powerpuff Girls.  People, do the math.</p><p>n Of course, I'm under no naïve impression that folks won't head into a CD like <i>Rock Egypt</i> with presupposed visions of cute lil' spaz chix dancing in their heads.  Don't make me rear the S word again, children.  And I don't think I'll need to; if anything, Salk Vacchin prove what funny, strange things are possible when three amateurs are caught ""messing around with a cheap lo fi minidisc recorder"" (to quote Kamiyama).  With a career catalog of just over 26-minutes, my biggest complaint is that so far, they're a tease.</p></div>"|6985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6985-rock-egypt/|7.0|Dominique Leone

    music, and I'd just assume the occasional hatemail remain as vague as possible. But for you to appreciate
    the following, I need to tell you that I'm a slightly geeky Jewish male with an ambiguous relationship to
    Zionism and an aversion to second-hand smoke. Maybe my left-of-center bias in the current xenophobic climate
    should make for another rubber-stamp approval of Andre Afram Asmar's first desert-dub release on esoteric
    hip-hop label Mush. But let me put it this way: I am certain that at this very moment, this album is playing
    in dorm rooms where oppressed-person status, long attention span and sturdy lungs are a prerequisite for
    entry. That's not an ad hominem; every time I put this album on at home, I feel like I'm hanging out in
    a place where my kind is not wanted.</p><p>
    
    The Palest-afarian photo collage in the liner notes reminds me of the walls of those oppressive college
    suites I naively thought I should enjoy chilling in. And though the streams of stoner-speak that open the
    first track, and the accompanying co-op basement drum circle, had me squirming right off the bat, the
    quality of the mix did keep my attention. But ""Camel Clutch"", in which singer Elias is completely drowned
    out by a mess of reverbed percussion, is a sign of failures to come. Sure enough, for the rest of the album
    any stray musicality gets drowned out by a rhythmic mess so moist-- nay, sodden-- that I can hardly hear
    myself hate it. Is this what Andre means when he calls himself ""the mugician""?</p><p>
    
    More to the point, what is it about Asmar's mix of unarticulated victim politics, para-Rastafarianism, and
    spiritual exhaustion that I find so hauntingly annoying? It's one of the more familiar brands of college
    narcissism on the West Coast, and I should be used to it by now. Maybe more disturbing is that Asmar uses
    his Middle Eastern provenance not as a source of musical ideas-- Arabic vocal samples are mixed just like
    anything else into the loose dub textures-- but as a license to fairly drip with self-indulgence, as carte
    blanche for songs that don't go anywhere, built from stale beats, inane mantras, and extended gurglings. To
    make matters worse, someone in the control room is dead set on putting everything through the same cheap
    delay pedal, like the wild world of water sports without the wild, or the sports. Just wet.</p><p>
    
    Capable experiments in mixing crop up once we leave the desert for a more tropical feel: straight-ahead
    ""Scientism"", for example, starts with a clean, guitar-driven hook, then makes its way from reggae-in-the-club
    to dub-in-the-headphones with an uncharacteristic smoothness. In ""Duniagariba"", traditional North African
    drumming melts into a braying hurricane, then congeals back into traditional drumming, deftly. Taken as a
    whole, though, these aimless jams herald no innovative fusion, no new Arab dub. Even Edward Said would nod
    off in no time.  This is no innovative fusion, no new Arab dub, just the same old aimless weed-soaked jams.
    Mugician, indeed!</p></div>"|322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/322-racetothebottom/|3.5|Jascha Hoffman

Data 80, a new project from multi-dimensional
    Swedish producer Håkan Lidbo, had a song called ""Love Was Made for Two"" on
    Force Tracks' excellent <em>Digital Disco</em> compilation. A catchy 80s-style
    synthpop song with vocodered vocals and nimble programming, the song nicely
    held down the sillier end of dance-pop spectrum covered by the compilation.
    But 46 minutes of music in the ""Love Was Made for Two"" style is a bit much,
    and that's what Data 80's self-titled debut has to offer.</p><p>
    One of the problems is that the ""Love Was Made for Two"" template is followed
    almost exactly on about half the tracks. It's the same vocal processing,
    same tempo, same basic arrangement, and sometimes (as on ""Baby, I Can
    Forgive"") damn near the same melody. The overuse of the vocoder is what
    really gets to me. I have a love/hate relationship with processed vocals at
    this point. Sometimes vocoders are used in a way that absolutely kills, and
    sometimes I can't get over how tired they sound.  Okay, I get it, it's
    futuristic pop and you sound like a robot. Just like Kraftwerk did thirty
    years ago. I follow.</p><p>
    The best tracks here offer something different. ""Open Skies"" reminds me a
    little of Dntel's ""The Dream of Evan and Chan"" in the way it channels the
    innocence of 80s electropop. Tellingly, it has clean vocals, and while the
    pitch seems just a bit unsteady a times, the singing sounds as fresh as a
    spring breeze when heard from inside the chorus of cylons. Also strong and
    clear is ""Don't Believe Me"" which, with a woman on lead, sounds quite
    Stereolab, mirroring the sort of electronic elegance they achieved on
    <em>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</em>.</p><p>
    Rounding out the decent stuff, the skeletal instrumental ""The Boy Who Grew
    Up to Be a Boy"" sounds a bit like Yellow Magic Orchestra, with a nice
    mixture of thin, dinky sounds and more organic squiggles. Even better is the
    instrumental I believe is called ""Every Pretty Girl's Dilemma"" (my lack of
    confidence here comes from the fact that the tracklist on the back of the
    sleeve doesn't match the one the inside), which features the percussive,
    popcorny Moog we all fell in love with in the 70s.</p><p>
    After that, well... ""Love Was Made For Two"" is still pretty fair, although
    another listen or two and I might get my fill.  All told, <i>Data 80</i>
    seems like a mixtape/DJ set sort of project-- good when sandwiched between
    other tracks from other artists, good on a 12-inch, not so good on a

I'm not gonna harp on the fact that Ryko are profiteering off the demise of another human being (there's no two ways about it), or dwell longer than necessary on the fact that Morphine themselves quickly fell into a...rut, musically speaking, a fact that this compilation only serves to make brutally clear.  1992-1995 isn't exactly an arbitrary span is the band's career, either, neatly encompassing the Morphine recordings Ryko owns: their first three full-lengths and some b-sides.  It's hardly a comprehensive retrospective of this very original band, but there's profit to be had.</p><p>
    Let's back-up though, and talk about this band, as perspective is required to understand the disc's failings.  Back in 1992, the sheer iconoclasm of Sandman's famously simple, two-string slide bass, in tandem with nothing more than drums and saxophones, was a triumphant calling card and almost claim-to-fame on their debut, <i>Good</i>.  It would soon become an unendurable obstacle; even after emerging from the sultry, seductive haze of their finest hour-- the sophomore effort <i>Cure for Pain</i>-- one couldn't help but wonder, \x93Is their next album gonna be just like the first two?\x94  Yes, it was.  There are only so many ways to write the same three songs-- up-tempo debauchery, slow, slinky atmospherics and beat-poetry readings-- and when you have such a narrow range of instrumentation, you can pretty much exhaust them on one record.  A few exceptions, like the bittersweet acoustics of \x93Gone For Good\x94 spring instantly to mind, but, they're not on this album.</p><p>n What you do get, aside from a pretty liberal definition of \x93best\x94-- given the wide swath this disc cuts through their albums-- are three unreleased tracks only begging to stay down. The recorded cuts, sure to bring smiles to the faces of the familiar-- \x93Honey White\x94, \x93I'm Free Now\x94, \x93You Look Like Raix94-- are more than sufficient to maintain a fairly high standard, as well as an adequate spectrum of the band's assorted powers.  But when you come down to it, a lot of Morphine's most impressive songs are remembered for nothing more than standing out on a samey album.  The shame or sheer hell-- depending on your outlook and/or relation to the band-- is that, when all these songs are brought together, they blend together like any other Morphine recording: the liquid-smooth-to-frantic-and-back, smoky and solid playing is, for its novelty, monotonous.  As for the newly released material, it's nothing but filler, sounding like watered-down versions of every other song on this collection-- and the last thing Morphine's well-oiled machinery needs is another fifteen minutes of sand.</p><p>n This is far, far less than representative of Morphine's greatness; although many of these songs are their best works, it's more of a Morphine intro course than a respectful farewell.  Five of these songs-- a full third of the album-- come from the incredible <i>Cure for Pain</i>; anyone interested in this album as a short road to their best tunes could do a lot worse,  but you'd better be served  just picking up <i>Cure for Pain</i> itself.  If you already own that, well, you didn't even need to read this review, did you?  Spanning a measly four years  and barely half the band's recorded output, it trades excellence in a heartbeat, for mediocrity and around fifteen bucks.</p></div>"|5435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5435-the-best-of-morphine-1992-1995/|6.7|Eric Carr

Or Serb, Russian, Gypsy, whatever: he's from
    over there and rocks the 'stache to prove it.  A self-exoticizing project that brought oompah-punk to downtown
    NYC, his Gogol Bordello exude the precise kind of gleeful inauthenticity that gets the hipsters horny. The
    overarching mood is that of a wasted shotgun wedding in the Karpaty, but guests on both
    sides of the puke-flecked altar  wear vintage corduroys and wouldn't know their rakiya from their
    gorilka.</p><p>
    
    Mind you, this is not a bad thing: Nikolai Gogol himself used his Ukrainian heritage primarily for
    flavor, and did his best writing in Rome. Bordello compensate for their calculated image with true
    immigrant work ethic-- for years, they'd tear up any club that would risk booking them, and Hutz's weekly
    DJ stint is still, improbably, on.</p><p>
    
    The band's debut CD, <i>Voi-La Intruder</i>, couldn't possibly recreate their onstage freneticism and hunger;
    for that, it would had to have come packaged with a Stoli and a blunt, but it toiled hard for its money all the same.
    Production was near-absent: fiddles and accordions waged a shoving match for the studio's seemingly lone
    microphone; on top of the racket, Hutz made like a winterized Nick Cave, gutturally imploring the listener to
    ""start wearing purple for me now"".</p><p>
    
    The sophomore <i>Multi Kontra Culti Vs. Irony</i> is a much more realized record: Bordello's blend of punk, folk,
    cabaret and what the Russians call ""cruel romance"" music is now smoother and more organic. Alas, as the
    band blew up in the intervening years, so did its ultimate ambition to become the world's next Manu
    Chao. A mere party record wouldn't cut it, and judging from the successes of Clandestino and Antibalas, we
    like our funk cut up with agitprop. Hutz and Co. are only too happy to oblige, and <i>Multi Kontra Culti</i> finds
    the crew deploying their ESL vocabulary in the service of vague political tirades.</p><p>
    
    Where <i>Voi-La</i> spun drunken tales of green card marriages, the new record feigns rage against fashionable
    bogeymen of globalization and, well, irony. To make matters worse, Gogol Bordello feel the need to
    constantly mention their masterplan for fear we won't connect the dots: a mildly raucous number is
    called ""Punk Rock Parranda"" as insurance.  A song that's equal parts punk and gypsy waltz earns the name ""Hopping on a Pogo
    Gypsy Stick"", which is less a title than a ready-made blurb. That's mighty media-conscious, coming from
    people whose website places the press links over a graphic of an unspooling toilet paper roll.</p><p>
    
    Buy it if you must, but the only sensible thing to do with grand anti-irony proclamations is, of course, to
    read them as irony. Gogol Bordello lack anything resembling an actual platform: when Hutz sings ""Let's
    get radical / Not ironic,"" he doesn't propose a specific brand of radicalism, he just floats a buzzword that happens
    to occupy his orbit, like ""green card"", ""contraband"", ""punk"", ""passport"" and ""gypsy"".  Typifying ambitious immigrants,
    Gogol Bordello have quickly learned how to sell old wares in their new environment. </p></div>"|3494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3494-multi-kontra-culti-vs-irony/|5.2|Michael Idov

    modern music ezine will be summoned to appear before a Total Information Awareness tribunal headed by
    Attourniquette General John Ashcroft's anointed eyebags and Homeland Securitrix Tom Ridge's roid-raging
    gerbils. Our feigned grasp of subcultural machinations will finally bite us in our collective posterior,
    and the staff will be divided. Certain blowhards will refuse to fess up the whereabouts of Godspeed You!
    Black Emperor and like-minded dissidents, while others of us will cooperate and be given star-spangled
    clip-on ties and badges that say Justice Consultant, or Liberty Advisor.</p><p>
    I plan to provide the feds with insight into the degenerate minds of every undergrounder except the former
    bandleader of Nation of Ulysses, Cupid Car Club, The Make-Up, and Weird War. He now refers to himself only
    as ""Svenonius,"" perhaps to drive home his exalted, totemic status. I will run interference on my gub'mint
    minders by playing his new band Scene Creamers' album <i>I Suck on That Emotion</i>.  See?  Eye bags.  See?
    Gerbils. This ain't political; it's get-it-on-core. You know, original booty-call soundtrack material, the
    stuff you pump in the background while you tell that low-priority crush that you're ""kind of drunk"" and
    ""can't sleep"" and ""don't [sigh] really know what you're doing tonight.""</p><p>
    Some of the suits will even tap their sensibly-loafered toes to the Creamers' spiraling, spare anglo-funk:
    Guitarist Alex Minoff (Golden, Six Finger Satellite) constantly riffs via a floorful of pedals that wah-flange-phase
    his every almost-indulgent flourish. Longtime Svenonius sidekick Michelle Mae navigates her bass with
    understated panache, and Blake Brunner's stop/start retro-military drums perfectly replace Make-Up-artist
    Steve Gamboa's more skillful, but also fill-happy, work. (The file on Brunner is thin but incriminating:
    he interviewed former Royal Trux and Weird War wandering guitarist Neil Hagerty in 2000, which raises some
    paranoid eyebrows, since Minoff was in Golden with Truxer Jon Theodore.)</p><p>
    I'll almost get away with my united front, because a superficial listen to the Creamers begs the question of
    why Svenonius' dapper ass spent the Clinton-giddy 90s shrouding his gospel-punk party-jams in neo-Marxist
    rhetoric, only to ""go horn-dog"" when his D.C. neighbors' geostrategery got all ballistic. I'll admit that
    some of the change-your-bedsheet material is rich, particularly ""Session Man"" (a randy take on musician-for-hire
    whoredom), ""Housework for Three"" (possibly a menage-ode to the classic pine-scented porn fantasy), and ""Wet
    Paint"" (about an art student, with the slurred yeah-times-three refrain, ""looks the same, but it ain't"").
    These songs prove that Svenonius could find a double entendre in a falafel wrap.</p><p>
    And whatever, partying can be subversive, reckon. There's definitely a libertine element to a post-midnight
    doowhatyalike vibe, despite the oddly codified hedonism of a zillion Best Spring Break Evers. But elsewhere
    on <i>I Suck on That Emotion</i>, Svenonius drops the funny and sings of naïve political pawns (""Candidate"",
    ""Bag Inc."")</p><p>
    Drag City dry humor meets John Fogerty, creating Neil Jamburger!  New guitar tones emerge, breaking up the
    Zapatista Zeppelin boogie!  Acoustic songs!  Surf songs!  The rest is pure Robitussin-slag; imagine a

    cock-rock histrionics! Get your Lockheed Martin on! Never mind the references to Roman Empire or Luxembourg
    or miserly millionaires! This red-white-and-blue-balled release embraces the butt-hott contradictatorial
    goofiness of enduring freedom. Pay no mind to the end of ""Here Comes the Judge Part Two"", when Svenonius
    says ""the accused is you."" Nilla, please! We built this city on shock and awe!</p></div>"|7017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7017-i-suck-on-that-emotion/|7.5|William Bowers

    beat-up, post-college apartment; their record sounds classically lo-fi, with vocals that could have been
    taped from a payphone.  Even their name is contemptuously, lazily vulgar.  That air of cool detachment
    drives everything that's great about this record: it rocks but doesx92t show off, and it's so direly
    fashion-unconscious that no matter how many jittery rhythms and caustic lyrics they deploy, they're
    never trendy about their post-punk leanings.  <i>Il Dito and Other Gestures</i> (""il dito"" is Italian for
    ""the finger"") is the In Out's fourth full-length; it follows a stretch where the band shrank to a trio,
    switched labels, played only intermittent local gigs-- oh, and toured Europe with Sebadoh.  But in spite
    of all the transitions, the new line-up already sounds taut and engrossing.</p><p>
    Singer and guitarist Todd Nudelman doesx92t have an immediately striking voice: slightly nasal and not at
    all powerful, his cool delivery covers a confident, masculine charisma.  It may be a cheap shot to compare
    them to The Fall, but you can hear a likeness in Nudelmax92s implied sneer and indifferently articulate
    lyrics, criticizing hedonism or commanding us to \x93auscultate\x94 him.  But he also flashes a sense of humor
    when he role-plays through \x93In Pursuit of You\x94, an almost cheeseball Afghanistan spy drama: \x93I tried you
    on the phone/ The lines had all been cut/ By me-- I forgot!/ It was me!\x94 shouted while the band feverishly
    plows ahead.</p><p>
    As a guitarist he plays it just as cool, ripping off the occasional solo but mainly locking in with the
    rhythm section.  Bassist Andy Abrahamson and new drummer Eric Boomhower are brutally fast together, from
    the drilling repetition of \x93Trapped Body (Auscultate Me)\x94 to the patter they keep up right under convoluted
    lyrics like \x93hedonism haunts our quality time.\x94  But then they slow down the pace: Abrahamsox92s basslines
    own several tracks, aiding the casual swagger of \x93Sense and Withdrawal\x94 and the mesmerizing, near-droning
    pace of \x93The Turning\x94.  He makes guest singer Ilona Virostek sound that much huskier, and he's the foil for
    Nudelmax92s cool reserve.</p><p>
    It can take a few listens to appreciate how wide-ranging the songs are, skittering through one,  then playing glowing keyboards on an old blues cover.  Everything hangs together; unlike their
    hipper contemporaries, the In Out spend more time nailing the material than getting in your face.  The band will probably do nothing to promote the album-- they probably wox92t tour your
    home town or college campus-- but this is one of the tightest, freshest, truly Underground releases so far this year.</p></div>"|4090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4090-il-dito-and-other-gestures/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

    like an unaware, prefabricated neon mausoleum.  While you can no longer barter your soul to Beelzebub for
    guitar-picking prowess, The Man will gladly exchange your eternal being for a place on the fryer and a
    hairnet.  Or one may just opt for the Sweet Biscuit Crunchers and some Purple Pepper Sauce for a dollar.
    The tragicomic irony of a fast food joint squatting on the Valhalla of Delta Blues out-tarnishes our
    collective lore more than the Bus Stop of Gethsemane and adjoining Mount of Olives Hotel.  And when you
    toss one of those sugary Sweet Biscuit Crunchers or gooey Honey-Butter Biscuits into your fat maw, you
    can let your mind drift to the thinly veiled sexual euphemisms of the blues, where biscuit almost certainly
    means ""vagina.""</p><p>
    The Blues had been raped, exploited, stolen, diluted, rediscovered, reforgotten, and rendered meaningless
    countless times long before the Russian Mafia kept hot on the heels of the Blues Brothers 2000 and the
    House of Blues primarily showcased Wu-Tang side projects and Godsmack.  Now, nearly a century after its
    birth, a non-ironic, post-Jon Spencer form of the Blues has risen again, ever so stubbornly and somnolently--
    and naturally, it's being led by a couple of white kids.  Jack White *ahem* not only namedrops Robert
    Johnson, he covers him.  Summons him.  Wears the same little derby as him.  And on ""Ball and Biscuit"",
    the album-stretching stomper of the White Stripes' fourth album, White moans, ""Let's have a ball and a
    biscuit, sugar.""  It's  all too plainly clear what he means.</p><p>
    What's less clear on the track (and the rest of <i>Elephant</i>), however, is just what Jack White intends.
    Certainly, one of his goals is to simply Rock, which his shit-hot guitar solos do bombastically; those
    Sears-Roebucks pickups buzz and screech like atomic harmonicas on the album's best songs.  But beyond this,
    White struggles to tenuously weld a growing amalgam of contradictions and genre experiments with a veneer
    of schtick, persona and Fonzie cool, while Meg's pancake-handed drumming drips solvent over the whole
    experiment.</p><p>
    The problem is that Jack White aims to honor his diverse heroes with too limited a palette; it's like paying
    tribute to Edward Hopper, Ansel Adams, Robert Colescott, and Georgia O'Keeffe in mural with a foot-pump-operated
    Wagner Power Painter and buckets of red and white.  ""Hypnotize"" valiantly strives for The Stooges, while
    ""Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine"" gives up four fingers to a butcher's knife on the altar of Led
    Zeppelin.  But Jack White is no Jim Page (nor Osterberg), and suggestions to the contrary will earn you an
    explanation at the end of the Questionable Musical Taste line on judgment day.  Meg White, meanwhile, pleads
    to her man on ""In the Cold, Cold Night"" like a coy Mo Tucker or Georgia Hubley-- more so than take-no-sass
    Patsy Cline or <i>Dusty in Memphis</i>.  Linty in Arkadelphia, perhaps.</p><p>
    The White Stripes' two strengths lie in their understanding of the physics of ""rock 'n' roll"" and, on the
    opposite end of the spectrum, their ability to craft a beautiful little boy/girl ditty.  As for the former,
    guitars kick in at the mathematically precise moment.  Drums drop out of the atmosphere in their window of
    opportunity, only to knock you back like a returning pendulum.  For the latter, ""You've Got Her in Your
    Pocket"", like ""We're Going to Be Friends"", makes one wish this whole new Foghat rock thing would blow over
    and make way for the Badfinger/Splinter/Fairport Convention revival that's been long overdue.  And therein
    lies the contradiction of The White Stripes: How do you combine the shit-hot with the ""twee?""  <i>Elephant</i>'s
    shortcomings suggests the enterprise is futile.  Similarly, the naïveté of Meg's playing deflates any Big
    Rock aspirations.  The child-like imagery of candy and Howdy Doody shirts renders Howlin' Wolf-like
    braggadocio transparent.</p><p>
    More importantly, the Stripes' multilayered, contrived personas-- both within individual songs and as the
    greater public face of the band-- fogs sincerity.  The useless, cheeky album closer, ""It's True That We Love
    One Another"", sums up this last obstacle.  Piling on the Meta like Charlie Kaufman scripted the lyrics, this
    hoedown toys with the Jack and Meg relationship ""mystery"" that was made abundantly clear in the 459 press
    articles on The White Stripes over the last two years, while throwing Holly Golightly into a threesome of
    unfunny winks.  When Jack sings, ""I've got your number written in the back of my Bible,"" a theoretically
    rich image from a much better unrealized song is wasted on an in-joke.</p><p>
    The album title refers to the endangered animal's brute power and less honored instinctual memory for dead
    relatives.  Essentially, The White Stripes admit to the contradictions in their music, but run through their
    hall of fame like a mad pachyderm.  In a climate of kitchen-tinkered, designer cuisine pop, the album offers
    buckets of batter-fried guitar crunch.  On tracks like ""Black Math"" and ""Little Acorns"", the grease and
    grunge of cheap guitar ingredients cover slim-pickings from the songwriting chicken.  People who just want
    some fried poultry can drive-thru and get a quick fix, but underneath, the spirits of the heroes wait for
    a true seance.</p></div>"|8652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8652-elephant/|6.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

Massachusetts' Cave In might have
    been an indie metal band-- with considerable muscle to back up their tunefulness and more riffs than Rush managed in the 90s-- but now, they're hardcore.
    Which is to say they're pop.  Which is to say, if you can't stand melodies, stay clear of <i>Antenna</i>.  While all of this might seem obvious since they're on
    RCA, and their CD can only be played using \x93extended copy protection music player\x94 (which they've helpfully included), but the real giveaway is the immediacy of
    the hooks, and the clean mega-compressed mastering.  In short, if  your favorite bands aren't played between Audioslave and Foo Fighters on modern rock radio,
    Cave In probably isn't one of them.</p><p>
    All of that said, <i>Antenna</i> is hardly a bad record.  Almost every tune features a melody or riff practically guaranteed to stick in your head at least once
    after hearing it (or have you squirming to avoid it), and vocalist Steve Brodsky thankfully resists the omnipresent Cobain-cum-Vedder-cum-Cornell yelp
    of the tried and true \x93alternative\x94 lead male.  Brodsky's playing-- while not terribly distinct--
    always injects the right amount of grunge-wallop or Edge-y atmospherics; in a way, Cave In remind me of a modern-day Blue Oyster Cult, in that their \x93heavy\x94
    music never really comes close to masking their considerable pop songwriting skill (Brodsky's voice is also of a similarly nasal, tenor quality as BOC's
    Donald \x93Buck Dharma\x94 Roeser).  So, if I haven't scared you away by comparing them to dinosaurs from the 70s-90s...</p><p>
    Opener \x93Stained Silver\x94 wastes no time in dropping the radio riffs, by way of Radiohead's \x93Pyramid Song\x94 (they also reference the \x93Paranoid Android\x94
    breakdown on the next track, \x93Inspire\x94).  ""Silver""'s flailing beats quickly make room for the oft-harmonized verse vocal, doubled by guitar; it's
    important to note insofar as the doubling makes it easier to pick out the melody on a crappy car stereo, for people who might only hear you once, during the
    afternoon drive.  Dispensing with my cynical, rockist commentary, the melody is worth remembering, and the mass of guitars during the chorus carry their
    share of muscular momentum.  \x93Anchor\x94 might be as easily dismissed: it's a squeaky clean Nirvana rip, but its energy is contagious, the chorus is pro-level catchy
    and the bridge really ties the room together.  Typical of <i>Antenna</i>, it's a well-written song given the major label sheen, which explains the props in
    mass-market alternarags like Spin.  While my descriptions ring death-knells for a lot of Pitchfork readers, I can only reiterate that awkwardly ambitious intent doesn't
    necessarily equal sucking.</p><p>
    The bad news is to be expected: some of this stuff is too formulaic after a few plays.  Except for two wildcards (the gentle acoustic ballad \x93Beautiful Sox94 and the lengthy cosmic
    jaunt \x93Seafrost\x94), you can generally count on the band adhering to verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus-repeat structure, replete with those hallowed LOUD-soft-LOUD dynamics.
    Brodsky's voice is hardly grating, but just like BOC, I'm not sure Cave In features the world's most interesting, nuanced singing, and again, I have to cast my vote
    against nu-rock's maxed-out mix preferences, making every moment on the disc a peak, which effectively makes every moment part of a monolithic, dulling experience.

I mean, sure, if you're the least bit talented you've got a massive hype machine working for you-- which isn't 
    a bad thing-- but you'll never shake those comparisons to the band that built the boat you're sailing.  I promise not to mention of the W\x97S\x97 ,  maybe as a favor to The Kills, 
    but mostly because the two bands sound nothing alike.</p><p>
    Regardless, the Kills won't need to fish for complimentary comparisons; suckers are jumping out of the water.  I'll be damned if vocalist VV (nee Alison Mosshart) doesn't 
    have a picture of PJ Harvey at her bedside, and the same goes double for instrumentalist Hotel (Londoner Jamie Hince) re: Neil Hagerty.  These influences aren't as disparate 
    as they seem: while Harvey and the Royal Trux worked on different sides of the fidelity line, they were both attempting expansive, ambitious modern updates of the blues.  The 
    Kills' aim is just about the opposite; despite the stylistic similarities, they're trying to return the pillaged form to its simpler roots.</p><p>
    Though their minimalism might sometimes sound like straight distillation, the tunes still hit, and hurt.  On the second track, \x93Cat's Claw\x94, the raised hackles of V.V.'s voice roughly 
    brush up against Hotel's descending string of power chords, and the \x93Got it, I want it\x94 chorus sinks its rusty sing-along hooks into your lips with stoned rapacity.  On this song-- and 
    as a rule-- The Kills offer strictly verse/chorus stuff, with a few careening bars of guitar skree passing for a bridge.  Oddly, this is what makes the song great, just as the Jesus and 
    Mary Chain distortion of the record's opener lines a wordlessly yowled chorus like lace on an exquisite corpse's casket, pulling the song beyond the confines of a boxy garage, out 
    into the dark streets.</p><p> 
    The band knows when-- and more importantly how-- to augment their simplicity, but it's a shame they don't use this gift more often.  It's not that any of these songs fail, at least in the 
    rock and roll or blues departments, but there's a point where minimalism can easily turn hollow.  The lockstep lyric and riff repetition of \x93Black Rooster\x94 wears itself out quickly, 
    begging for variation about three minutes in, but the band keeps pushing straight ahead.  And no matter how much enthusiasm the band pours into it, the titular mantra of \x93Fuck 
    the People\x94 still sounds like nothing more than a predicate pose.  Like their pseudonyms, the band's shove-it adherence to a few glib phrases and riffs is going stale; it's still good, 
    but once in a while, you catch a whiff of lazy, empty self-mythologizing.</p><p>
    But even a hollow brick can knock you out cold: there's enough hypnotic arm-wrestling in the slippery back-and-forth rhythm of \x93Hitched\x94 to drop a cruiserweight critic, and-- despite 
    the minimalist posture-- there's enough thematic variation to make things interesting.  \x93Kissy Kissy\x94, for instance, starts with a ringing guitar figure that almost sounds more at home 
    in the Ganges Delta than the Mississippi, before following its thudding drums into doomsville.  Though few and far between, the numbers where the band slows down and eases 
    back on the attitude are things of beauty; \x93Wait\x94, the album's longest and most repetitive track, makes perfect use of the yearning core of V.V.'s tough, stripped voice, stretching seductive 
    curiosity into two-chord cosmic foreplay.  The final track, \x93Gypsy Death and You\x94, is in a similar vein, V.V. and Hotel using only voice, acoustic guitar, and insistent, reverbed drum hits to 
    sketch their own halfway-to-sober version of ramshackle folk.</p><p>
    If they should break through to the mainstream, The Kills probably deserve it more than most.  Their poses are balanced with enough genuine emotion to approach the sum of their 
    influences; they play with more style and flair than almost any band in a scene where the former is usually all that matters.  Still, it's a bitter reality: they'd never be getting this kind of 
    attention if it weren't for the White Stri-- <i>fuck!</i></p></div>"|4424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4424-keep-on-your-mean-side/|7.8|Brendan Reid

    cheapo fallout, a smallpox outbreak carried through the subway tunnels it was hard enough climbing stairs thinking \x93Any moment now, I could slip and break my 
    neck.\x94 And yet, as I dwell on the unlikely finality of that snap, the supposedly impending revolution care of New York City's No-Neck Blues Band is one thing I'm not 
    particularly worried about, even as they haunt my dreams in Mysterio clouds of sulfur and patchouli smoke, their satchels filled with obscure Don Cherry records, 
    poisonous berries, and bearded songster scores found in dumpsters outside rehearsal spaces.</p><p>
    \x93Witch\x94 eases things open with great haunted promise, snaking its way up the river between <i>Apocalypse Now</i>-era Rhythm Devils and the Doors' distended psychedelic 
    menace, writhing and enticing great reptilian figures to surface, their faces slick with mud.  \x93Play Your Play\x94 comes on in home-stitched priest gowns, the trails and 
    runners wavering in and out of the physical realm as cloth drags along the ground, taking a few minutes to really get to the tom-tapped ceremony of accordion and organ 
    drones, slowly attaining a chilled plateau they sustain for nearly twelve minutes. The sprawling \x93The Shepherd Takes a Shine to the Abyss\x94 that closes the album is the most 
    exquisite exploration of the bunch, and as beautiful as anything they've ever conjured up. Building from spider-silk strands of cello and acoustic bass, its lightly delayed 
    guitars slowly coalesce to stand upright, merging the bratty sax bleats into a wholesome peace.</p><p>
    But the magic and smokescreens run out of steam in the middle of the record: \x93Open That Grass Cax94 begins to piddle and plink, revealing bored revelers behind their 
    renaissance wardrobe, their rope-and-wood machines petering then falling apart. The title track only has its punny name going for it, a dorm-sponsored, smoke-out 
    drum circle; \x93This Absent-Minded Crisis?\x94 is two minutes of baby babble even Yoko Ono couldn't entertain.</p><p>
    \x93Fuck-No\x94 at least has the good sense to steal Sun Ra's cosmically therapeutic drum reverb, guaranteeing lift-off, but the captain comes out of the cabin dressed like an 
    orangutan from a novelty calendar, making oogy-googy noises in utter disdain for Ra's muumuu. Twelve minutes in, pecked notes and monkey-scat-- not to mention a 
    wooden train whistle-- thoroughly derail the piece. </p><p>
    While a small beam of light fell upon their Harlem loft with a record they wrangled out on John Fahey's Revenant label-- earning critical accolades from high places-- the 
    group remains relatively obfuscated, rarely playing shows and splintering into multiple personalities to obscure their different trails. Their early releases are pure handmade 
    loveliness, sheathed in mystifying, artful packages, the music mashing together Cromagnon, Alan Sondheim, Father Yod, and other privately-pressed wax icons to the point where 
    picking apart their influences became a futile exercise in bogus alchemy. Each was its own potent dose, and full gnosis was never quite possible when absorbing them; 
    unfortunately, Intonomancy is a shoddier stone tablet, a wearisome simplification of their decade-old primitivism. Their music, now much more clearly recorded, finally reveals 
    itself more sloth than Thoth.</p></div>"|5817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5817-intonomancy/|5.6|Oliver Lache

    I guess it worked out okay for them, but the perils of this approach are readily apparent: they came within inches of naming themselves the Commodes, and even 
    closer to labeling themselves the Commodities.  This is just an off-handed guess, but I'm thinking the three guys in True Love Always got the pedestrian title of their 
    latest album (their fifth since 1997) using the same method.</p><p> 
    I base that assumption on the total inaccuracy of the title: if any thought went into it, it was certainly ironic, and that just doesn't seem to be their style.  In reality, there's not 
    a cloud in sight on this album, and as a matter of fact, irony is equally absent.  The bossa-inflected pop these guys churn out is so breezy, it'll blow over any objects in the 
    room not tightly secured, and if you hear a single distorted guitar anywhere on this record, you heard more than I did.</p><p> 
    Guitarist/vocalist John Lindaman seems to value clarity in all things, keeping his electric firmly rooted in a clean, jazzy tone, and singing in an even, warm tenor that sounds 
    a lot like James Taylor with wider nasal passages.  Drummer Matt Datesman and bassist Tony Zanella give things a minimal push with a series of easy rhythms, and 
    generally manage to keep the backgrounds interesting, if harmless.  This formula results in a bag of songs ranging from honey-soaked to just sugary; not a wide range, but 
    when the songs are stuffed with moments like the chorus of the opener \x93Give Me the Clouds\x94-- where Lindaman and backing vocalist Evelyn Hurley paste huge harmonies all
    over an adhesive flytrap of a melody-- you don't so much mind.  \x93Let the Rain Blow Ix94 even has a nice, understated guitar solo that would have fit in pretty well on <i>A Hard Day's 
    Night</i>.  \x93For You Alone\x94 features a fantastic, rapid-fire melody, but it's marred somewhat by the fact that Lindaman treats it as a duet with Hurley, and Hurley, while great on 
    backup, doesn't quite cut it out in front.</p><p> 
    Problems also arise on songs like \x93Summer Books\x94, where the band's sense of economy gets them in trouble, resulting in an overly repetitive second half, with the lines \x93You, like 
    summer books, don't kiss and tell/ And I'd be lost without you,\x94 repeated dozens of times.  \x93Peel Away\x94 exaggerates that problem greatly, adopting what I suppose you could call a 
    more experimental structure, with a vastly more fractured and a section where Lindaman layers his vocals, creating a repeated pattern of the partial phrase \x93why don't\x94 with a 
    slower melody over it.  It's conceptually very interesting, but somewhat annoying in execution.  Still, points for branching out.</p><p> 
    Ultimately, I'm not really sure whether to celebrate or lament True Love Always for their complete lack of guile.  On one hand, 36 minutes of pure silver lining can get a little 
    tiresome, but it's also nice to see a band so direct and unassuming in this age of forced irony.  <i>Clouds</i> is certainly pleasant listening, stuffed with good melodies and some 
    accomplished musicianship, but it's also not likely to hook you back into a lot of repeated listens, given the way it lays all its cards out right away.  A desultory toss of Webster's 
    to the floor sums it up nicely: quaint.  If that's your bag, have at it.</p></div>"|8170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8170-clouds/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Having spent most of his days dreaming of a place of his own out there, where he could sit on the screened      porch on a summer night, playing cards, drinking cold beers, listening to old Willie Nelson wavering as his hand played out, it seemed to come true almost ten years ago,      when he had his own ranch house. And yet, he finally confided to me that he had never, in all those years, drank a beer or played cards, much less sat out on the porch listening      to Willie. It was one of the saddest admissions I ever heard from my old man.</p>
<p>I tried to be discreet when I listened to this Campfire Songs CD; I tried to make sure he was beyond earshot of this Animal Collective offshoot, as the vibrations would no doubt      come to bear on all those dark, mosquito-filled evenings he missed. Recorded on somebody's porch in rural Maryland, <i>Campfire Songs</i> is supremely relaxed, intent on reveling      in the blissful pastoralism longed for by Avey Tare and Geologist's ""Good Country: (off of <i>Danse Manatee</i>), yet not by way of its tribal electronics and urban babble. Instead,      we have awkwardly plucked strings and arrhythmic, strummed ellipses curving in and out of each other as they lay in the clearing, insects wandering through their hair as the      leaves of the tambourine trees rustle on ""Queen in my Pictures"". The trio of voices, scarcely harmonized, creates a discernible motion, moving in and out of each other's throats,      erecting a semblance of structure that stabilizes for a night, even if it's built on the flimsiest of timbres.</p>
<p>As they turn their meandering strums into ""Doggy"", Campfire Songs almost approach the eroding acoustic glow the Grifters tenaciously shone from <i>Eureka</i>, the embers burning      low under the gray ash as the sounds of rain fall and hiss about their little circle. The flames slowly build back, fanned by banjo and mandolin, the sound billowing from smoky green      sticks and crackling branches. Somewhere a plane circles, droning high overhead, revealing open space in the lo-fi recording.</p>
<p>""Two Corvettes"" is more content to idle, absorbing the night air. Just when you think they're falling asleep, the acoustic guitars stumble back with a clenched rattling, their voices      turning more animalistic, wailing just past the light of the fire. If the Oldham boys had clopped up in ostrich skin boots to Buzzy Linhart's loft space around <i>4am at Frank's</i> to holler      out ""Come A Little Dog""-- still haunted by the coyote spirits that bellow up in the Hill Country-- they may as well have blazed over to this back porch instead. But when the Campfires      start to channel ""Taking Care of Business"" while the katydids yammer in the distance, it hits you: these are city slickers out on a weekend trip.</p>
<p>These boys are taking Willie Nelso's golf balls and cracking them open, slowly unraveling the rubber band and nylon twine wrap until they arrive at the gooey gray center of it all,      tentatively biting into the blue goop once dumped into Whiskey River. High on said toxins, they lose themselves in a drifting, imaginary suite, a patch of fantasy that made this city      boy pine for a beautiful place out in the country.</p></div>"|1268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1268-campfire-songs/|7.1|Andy Beta

If you're the producer of a pop, rap or electronica album, a real live jazz musician
    can bring a spontaneous friction to your recording session; like wind-up cars, they can spin around of their own volition, careening with energy over your album.  But for as much
    freedom as they enjoy, if you're behind the mixing board you can control them like a kid in the den: you can block them with cushions, see if they can clear the floor, even throw under
    the couch in a tantrum.</p><p>
    No matter how many high-brow ideas Spring Heel Jack layered on the album before this-- 2001's <i>Masses</i>-- it was the \x93gee whiz\x94 playtime factor that made
    them exciting. Veteran drum-n-bass duo John Coxon and Ashley Wales are life-long jazz fans; aside from a guest spot by John Surman on <i>Disappeared</i>, they had never used live
    performers until the Thirsty Ear Blue Series invited them to collaborate with some of its roster.</p><p>
    Next thing they knew, they had control over almost a dozen of the best improvisers in jazz, from pianist Matthew Shipp and bassist William Parker to monolithic saxophonist Evan
    Parker and violist Mat Maneri.  On <i>Masses</i> the duo dropped the live musicians into shimmering electronic backgrounds and ambient loops: a grinding guitar, a faded radio orchestra
    or a thudding upright bass, each backdrop ambient and passive, but vibrant and tricky enough to challenge the musicians who wandered through them, sometimes merely reacting,
    sometimes violently confronting the samples (or each other).</p><p>
    Coxon and Wales repeat the concept-- and some of the backdrops-- on <i>Amassed</i>, a follow-up that takes the basic idea from <i>Masses</i> but changes the cast as well as the atmosphere.
    While Shipp and Evan Parker return for this album, the personnel as a whole shifts to more European players, and the music slows down, losing some of the band's snarkiness and
    humor.  <i>Amassed</i> doesn't spark as much excitement as their last outing: it's less satisfying, less surprising and far less dynamic.  It's never weak, but it suffers greatly in inevitable
    comparisons with its predecessor.</p><p>
    That's not the fault of the musicians.  It's tough to pick who's better: Maneri and William Parker on the first album, or trumpeter Kenny Wheeler and drummer/pseudo-performance
    artist Han Bennick on this one; it's like arguing over who would win a fight between King Kong and Godzilla.  The improv is as sharp and natural as on <i>Masses</i>; Evan Parker stands
    out as the star soloist, with his fluid, tight circles of notes detonating in the space between academia, passion and those little rock gardens you tend with a rake.  Wheeler is in
    elegant form, coolly soothing and deeply reflective.  For a wildcard, they add Jason Pierce, aka J. Spaceman (Spiritualized, Spaceman 3) on distorted, processed guitar; while his
    wailing is less nimble than his colleagues' performances, his style connects the electronic atmospheres to the live spontaneity of the band.</p><p>
    Spring Heel Jack remain subtle in handling musicians: most of the tracks still run over sampled elements that lay in the background, affecting the pace and atmosphere without
    hemming in the melody or rhythm.  They don't splice or splinter the performances; in fact, most of the time they stay out of the way, throwing out a cue or shaping a performance by
    trimming it, such as on \x93Maroc\x94, where they excise everybody but Parker and Spaceman, trimming a group recording down to a duet.  The only guy they grapple with is Wheeler: on his
    ballad feature \x93Lit\x94 they surround his trumpet with scrunching sounds like bored kids crunching styrofoam cups, an effect that's witty but somewhat annoying.</p><p>
    But for most of this record, the humor and novelty of the <i>Masses</i> lineup is gone.  Their decision to repeat some of the backdrops is the first thing that takes the sheen off the project.  For
    example, \x93100 Years Before\x94 uses the \x93Over the Rainbow\x94-like horns and wide spaces from <i>Masses</i>' \x93Chorale\x94, and \x93Obscured\x94 repeats \x93Chiaroscuro\x94.  Even in the improvisation,
    the band seems to be getting down to business rather than enjoying themselves: everything's familiar, and everyone knows the rules.  There are highlights, like the pastoral openness
    and disjointed noise of \x93100 Years Before\x94 and the grinding rise and fall of \x93Wormwood\x94, but too often Coxon and Wales set up the kind of heads-down dirging group improvisation 
    where no lead voice emerges and the music seems endless.  The concluding piece, \x93Obscured\x94, may show off their chemistry, but it's a turgid way to end the record.</p><p>
    After they cut this album, Spring Heel Jack played some concerts with a band that took players from both sessions.  A review in The Wire described a set where Coxon and Wales
    took an active role on-stage, Coxon playing guitar and Wales doing everything from blowing a trumpet to tearing up sheets of paper.  If they make another record, they should think
    about making a live album-- they could document a challenging new context and give the jazz guys a chance to turn the tables, messing around with Coxon and Wales without a
    mixing board to hide behind.</p></div>"|7441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7441-amassed/|7.3|Chris Dahlen

Bomb shelters won't do you any good; your gas mask     might as well be crafted from Slim Jims and bubble wrap. As the crusty leather heart of breakcore sith lord     Venetian Snares, Funk drops more Fat Men per month than militant tree huggers drop acid, and every endeavor     is more potent than any microdot floating around Northern Oregon.</p>
<p>Belying the civility of his death-penalty-lacking     homeland, Venetian Snares is the musical equivalent of a chainsaw massacre in the violent offenders' wing of     your local Federal Penitentiary, raw flesh and circuitry overload guaranteed. But what's most impressive is     the diversity of the Snares catalogue, the natural extension of Funk's Nosferatu fingernails into the shadowy     reaches of electronic music; the psychotic drifter who programmed ""Skelechairs"" is the same cuddly birthday     clown who gave us <i>Songs About My Cats</i>, and Funk has been comfortable with every transition, slipping     into various skins like Planet \xB5's very own Buffalo Bill.</p>
<p><i>Find Candace</i>, released on the Hymen label as a companion piece to the <i>Doll Doll Doll</i> LP, comes     two months after the highly anticipated <i>Winter in the Belly of a Snake</i>, an album that finds Funk     stripping a few layers of dead skin from his sound to expose a bone structure ancestral to his razor-sharp     cut-ups, but augmented with a more patient ear for composition and climax. Ambient passages abound, dark     washes of Purgatory gray that suggest Seefeel's <i>Ch-Vox</i> on an ECT regiment.</p>
<p>The tension here is thicker     here than on other Venetian Snares outings, a mortician's gloom hovering over the epic, Siberian tundra     of ""Gottrahmen"" and the symphonic ""Sink Slow Angel"", whose undead pinball beats can't contain the sinister     string movements gnashing their teeth just below the track's glassy surface. The unpredictably touching     ""Dad"" features Funk on vocals, and its harrowing mantra (""I had a dream you were still alive"") sticks with     you like the diseased laments of a mental patient, writing letters that will never get mailed. Much has     been made of the vocal tracks on this record, most notably Funk's sloshed philharmonic take on The Misfits'     ""She"", but their presence is limited, and the fade very easily into the Venetian Snares patchwork.</p>
<p>What comes as the biggest surprise is the de-emphasis on low-end, which Funk has eschewed in favor of more     digital-sounding breaks, fragments of fiberglass and copper wiring that flicker and surge with a nod to     Autechre at their most mathematical and inorganic. So no unstable jungle or kill-n-bass attitude pops up     on <i>Winter in the Belly of a Snake</i>, although the beautifully ugly Zen meditation ""January"" and the     speed-freak flashback ""In Quod"" kick up some dust with exorcised synth melodies and accelerated PVC drumkits.     The 16 tracks found here are a winding black river cutting through miles of clear-cut forest and silent     abandoned farms, carrying unidentified corpses out to sea.</p>
<p>The dispatchers of said corpses are the heroes of <i>Find Candace</i>, whose mummified drill-n-bass rampages     are aimed squarely at the violent predator in each and every one of us.  Venetian Snares is safely within the     borders of his murderous empire on <i>Candace</i>, dissecting jungle breaks and thick basslines, and swapping     the vital organs until all terminology lines are blurred. This familiarity inflicts a small amount of damage     to the record, lessening its impact by rehashing a successful attack plan; a vinyl copycat killer if ever     there was one. Not essential, then (<i>Higgins Ultra-Low Track Glue Funk Hits 1972-2006</i> is a much bolder     take on this sound), but masochistically satisfying regardless.</p>
<p>The lead track, a remix of <i>Doll Doll Doll</i>'s ""Befriend a Child Killer"", actually fleshes out the     original's coarse and volatile loops, turning an abrasive hardcore screamer into Dieselboy for lobotomized     Bad Boy Yardies.  Funk frontloads <i>Find Candace</i> with a deceptively methodical rhythm of interlocking     snares wrapped in slasher flick ambience that would have Jamie Lee Curtis begging for a toe-tag. Including     the previously released ""Dolleater"" is a strange decision-- seeing as how we have 12 new tracks from Funk     every time we blink-- and it hurts the flow of the album.  ""Yor"", fortunately, makes amends, evolving from     faulty-modem feedback to time-lapse ogre boogie in time to set things right.</p>
<p>The final minutes of ""Yor"" hint at the iron maiden solitude of <i>Winter in the Belly of a Snake</i>, floating     by like a bitter poltergeist at midnight, but <i>Find Candace</i> ultimately comes in a distant second. All     of the tracks are tight and hard-hitting, but they're too measured and predictable to really smash your skull     against the curb. The putrid spirit of invention that informs <i>Belly of a Snake</i> is more exemplary of     Aaron Funk's strengths, definitive evidence that this isn't some kook we have on our hands, no wanna-be Son     of Sam.

Bomb shelters won't do you any good; your gas mask     might as well be crafted from Slim Jims and bubble wrap. As the crusty leather heart of breakcore sith lord     Venetian Snares, Funk drops more Fat Men per month than militant tree huggers drop acid, and every endeavor     is more potent than any microdot floating around Northern Oregon.</p>
<p>Belying the civility of his death-penalty-lacking     homeland, Venetian Snares is the musical equivalent of a chainsaw massacre in the violent offenders' wing of     your local Federal Penitentiary, raw flesh and circuitry overload guaranteed. But what's most impressive is     the diversity of the Snares catalogue, the natural extension of Funk's Nosferatu fingernails into the shadowy     reaches of electronic music; the psychotic drifter who programmed ""Skelechairs"" is the same cuddly birthday     clown who gave us <i>Songs About My Cats</i>, and Funk has been comfortable with every transition, slipping     into various skins like Planet \xB5's very own Buffalo Bill.</p>
<p><i>Find Candace</i>, released on the Hymen label as a companion piece to the <i>Doll Doll Doll</i> LP, comes     two months after the highly anticipated <i>Winter in the Belly of a Snake</i>, an album that finds Funk     stripping a few layers of dead skin from his sound to expose a bone structure ancestral to his razor-sharp     cut-ups, but augmented with a more patient ear for composition and climax. Ambient passages abound, dark     washes of Purgatory gray that suggest Seefeel's <i>Ch-Vox</i> on an ECT regiment.</p>
<p>The tension here is thicker     here than on other Venetian Snares outings, a mortician's gloom hovering over the epic, Siberian tundra     of ""Gottrahmen"" and the symphonic ""Sink Slow Angel"", whose undead pinball beats can't contain the sinister     string movements gnashing their teeth just below the track's glassy surface. The unpredictably touching     ""Dad"" features Funk on vocals, and its harrowing mantra (""I had a dream you were still alive"") sticks with     you like the diseased laments of a mental patient, writing letters that will never get mailed. Much has     been made of the vocal tracks on this record, most notably Funk's sloshed philharmonic take on The Misfits'     ""She"", but their presence is limited, and the fade very easily into the Venetian Snares patchwork.</p>
<p>What comes as the biggest surprise is the de-emphasis on low-end, which Funk has eschewed in favor of more     digital-sounding breaks, fragments of fiberglass and copper wiring that flicker and surge with a nod to     Autechre at their most mathematical and inorganic. So no unstable jungle or kill-n-bass attitude pops up     on <i>Winter in the Belly of a Snake</i>, although the beautifully ugly Zen meditation ""January"" and the     speed-freak flashback ""In Quod"" kick up some dust with exorcised synth melodies and accelerated PVC drumkits.     The 16 tracks found here are a winding black river cutting through miles of clear-cut forest and silent     abandoned farms, carrying unidentified corpses out to sea.</p>
<p>The dispatchers of said corpses are the heroes of <i>Find Candace</i>, whose mummified drill-n-bass rampages     are aimed squarely at the violent predator in each and every one of us.  Venetian Snares is safely within the     borders of his murderous empire on <i>Candace</i>, dissecting jungle breaks and thick basslines, and swapping     the vital organs until all terminology lines are blurred. This familiarity inflicts a small amount of damage     to the record, lessening its impact by rehashing a successful attack plan; a vinyl copycat killer if ever     there was one. Not essential, then (<i>Higgins Ultra-Low Track Glue Funk Hits 1972-2006</i> is a much bolder     take on this sound), but masochistically satisfying regardless.</p>
<p>The lead track, a remix of <i>Doll Doll Doll</i>'s ""Befriend a Child Killer"", actually fleshes out the     original's coarse and volatile loops, turning an abrasive hardcore screamer into Dieselboy for lobotomized     Bad Boy Yardies.  Funk frontloads <i>Find Candace</i> with a deceptively methodical rhythm of interlocking     snares wrapped in slasher flick ambience that would have Jamie Lee Curtis begging for a toe-tag. Including     the previously released ""Dolleater"" is a strange decision-- seeing as how we have 12 new tracks from Funk     every time we blink-- and it hurts the flow of the album.  ""Yor"", fortunately, makes amends, evolving from     faulty-modem feedback to time-lapse ogre boogie in time to set things right.</p>
<p>The final minutes of ""Yor"" hint at the iron maiden solitude of <i>Winter in the Belly of a Snake</i>, floating     by like a bitter poltergeist at midnight, but <i>Find Candace</i> ultimately comes in a distant second. All     of the tracks are tight and hard-hitting, but they're too measured and predictable to really smash your skull     against the curb. The putrid spirit of invention that informs <i>Belly of a Snake</i> is more exemplary of     Aaron Funk's strengths, definitive evidence that this isn't some kook we have on our hands, no wanna-be Son     of Sam. Our killer seems to have more purpose, handling his mutilations with a painfully steady artisan's     touch. Venetian Snares is one sick and twisted menace to society, but he sure as hell is good at what he     does.</p></div>"|11858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11858-winter-in-the-belly-of-a-snake-find-candace/|6.5|Mark Martelli

Trail of Dead, still reeling from the acclaim of last year's monster rock epic
    <i>Source Tags &amp; Codes</i>, now stand at that difficult juncture marked by the skulls and bones of countless
    indie-gone-major bands before them.  A&amp;R; ""need that next record ASAP,"" before the band loses their shot at
    the fickle tastes of mainstream American consumers, while the die-hards-- who'd be content to wait at least
    another year if it meant a better album-- expect a hallowed follow-up to either equal or surpass the band's
    treasured last release.  In the meantime, the label wants an EP to keep the band in the spotlight, tide over
    fans, and further hype the forthcoming follow-up.</p><p>
    
    So we get this: <i>The Secret of Elena's Tomb</i>, a clearly rushed product containing four newly recorded
    songs and one experimental leftover, with multimedia bonus features tacked on as a last-minute point-of-sale
    and a means of banking on those who would otherwise just download the thing (its artwork, unlike that of
    <i>Source Tags</i>, isn't much to look at).  The disc's songs being, presumably, among the few Trail of
    Dead has written in the past year, it's safe to say that the band wasn't likely given the obvious advantage
    of selectivity.  In light of that constraint, it's understandable that some of this disc's tracks aren't
    up to par, but also promising that the ones that pay off show the band working toward a departure from the
    sound of their last album.</p><p>
    
    All of Trail of Dead's albums up to this point seemed refinements of the sound that finally culminated on
    <i>Source Tags &amp; Codes</i>, a blistering, frenzied stomper summoning the aural equivalent of apocalypse
    and damnation.  On <i>Elena's Tomb</i>, they seem ready push things forward, if not yet clear which path to
    tread.  As such, the record is experimental in the truest sense, each of its tracks signifying a possible
    point of departure: one continues on their present course-- a sound which they've clearly grown bored with--
    while another gives up that ghost and cashes in on the coattails of Dashboard Confessional; two others hint
    at a more pop-oriented reincarnation of <i>Source Tags</i>' more soft-focus moments, ""Another Morning Stoner""
    and its title track.</p><p>
    
    As can be expected, the band's transitional status doesn't exactly translate to a gripping listen.  Many of
    their experiments either fall flat, or just seem too forced: ""Mach Schau"" is one of these, opening the disc
    with the band's most overt Sonic Youth plundering to date.  Awkwardly straddling some imaginary line between
    experimentalism and rote hardcore, and lacking any trace of melody, they seem lost, and for the first time
    since their self-titled debut, a little self-conscious.  The car-crash collision of these two genres is--
    if nothing else-- unique, but the generic, shouted chorus and mumbled-word verses play like a hackneyed
    approximation of The Velvet Underground's ""Murder Mystery"", about as far from inspiration as these guys
    have ever wandered.</p><p>
    
    Worse still is ""Counting Off the Days"", a thankfully brief shot at capturing-- or, possibly, satirizing--
    the overwrought drama club banality MTV pipes into the bedrooms of suburban teenagers.  A 12-string acoustic
    strums repetitively, a cello droning subtly beneath, while Conrad Keely intones, ""And it's <i>sooooo hard</i>
    to <i>starrrrrve!!!</i>"" in a scary parallel with Chris Carraba's unforgettably piercing, ""Anywhere... With
    anyone... <i>Mayyykking ouuuut!!!</i>""  If this is a joke, I give them credit for faking me out; if not,
    they should stop and consider whether America really needs another diary-scribbling pussy sobbing on its
    disdainful shoulder.</p><p>
    
    Of their options, Trail of Dead seem most comfortable-- and are far and away the most successful-- reveling
    in melodic saturation.  ""All St. Day"" and ""Crowning of a Heart"" both seem like logical progressions from
    <i>Source Tags</i>, retaining that album's drumkit combat and misty production, but pushing the songwriting
    straight to the fore.  ""Crowning of a Heart"", <i>Elena</i>'s clear standout, is almost wrenching, following
    a serpentine vocal hook, and dropping mid-song into one of the band's trademark instrumental segues, which
    rides a simple, drawn-out guitar figure and beautiful, languid four-part harmonies.  ""All St. Day"" is nearly
    as good, a sort of tom-fueled, autumnal inverse of <i>Source Tags</i>' urgent ""Monsoon"", with an insistent
    backbeat and Neil Busch adamantly sing/shouting the killer refrain, ""Everybody knows you can't hide forever.""</p><p>
    
    The record's fifth and final song could be counted among the record's many bonus features, a dancefloor
    rocker that appeared last fall on the UK single for ""Another Morning Stoner"".  Technically, it's not even
    Trail of Dead; being a collaboration between Jason Reece and non-Trail member Tyler Jacobsen, it would more
    aptly fall under the header of Reece's side project A Roman Scandal.  Its inclusion here further confuses
    things, adding to the disc's overall lack of focus-- although, that said, it's a pretty solid track, with
    punishing neo-industrial beat programming and an impassioned (if sometimes a bit tuneless) vocal performance
    from Reece.</p><p>
<i>The Secret of Elena's Tomb</i> is the sound of a band, having accomplished everything they dreamed of,
    starting from scratch.  Drained by tours and shouldering pressure from their backers, Trail of Dead are
    throwing darts blindfolded, hoping at least one hits the board.  While this disc is an obvious placeholder,
    it's not fueled by insulting or wanton disregard for their reputation, or their fans.  In fact, fans of
    <i>Source Tags &amp; Codes</i> will likely find it worth their $6.98-- if not for the two extremely promising
    highlights, then for the videos for ""Relative Ways"" and ""Another Morning Stoner"".  Yet those hoping it might
    indicate what to expect from Trail of Dead's next album are left in the dark; fumbling for answers, they'll
    probably run into the band.</p></div>"|179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/179-the-secret-of-elenas-tomb-ep/|6.7|Ryan Schreiber

    troupe could do no wrong and that the well of comedic genius might very well flow to the end of time. A
    string of diminishing films and the demise of Monty Python itself disappointed quite a few, but since its
    participants were still alive and kicking, so were the hopes of their fans. Eric Idle, along with John
    Cleese, stood out particularly, and Idle's work on the TV special, <i>The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash</i>,
    showed that there were enough good ideas left in his head to keep the faithful tuning in.</p><p>
    
    Idle then pulled a John Lennon, appearing brilliant in group work, and briefly so after going solo only to
    punish diehards with an unbroken stream of mediocrity thereafter-- not least of which came during his
    short-lived stint on the U.S. sitcoms <i>Nearly Departed</i> and <i>Suddenly Susan</i>.  Now he's added
    another dubious chapter to his legacy with the album, <i>The Rutland Isles</i>.</p><p>
    
    Posing as a brief excerpt
    from host Nigel Spasm's 168-part documentary on the namesake islands, <i>Rutland Isles</i> also seems to
    pose as something related to The Rutles, which it is not. In actuality, it's a rather tepid music-and-comedy
    record from a man who stands shamelessly beside Steve Martin and Robin Williams in the Love-Me-Because-I-Used-To-Be-Funny
    Club.  Merrie Olde national treasure though he may be, Idle never comes close to justifying his continuing
    existence with <i>The Rutland Isles</i>.  Worse: he traces that sadly familiar line washed-up comedians can't
    seem to avoid.</p><p>
    
    Though this album isn't as bad as hearing a formerly respectable comedian like Robert Klein tell flaccid jokes
    about O.J. and John Bobbitt years after they were deemed exhausted by the lowliest nightclub hack, it does
    reveal Idle's regression into some terribly cheap humor. See if you can spot the gag in the following track
    titles: ""Penis Fish"", ""Gay Animal Song"", ""Muff Diving"", and ""Homo Semi-Erectus"". Give up? Here's a hint:
    they're about sex, and they're as obvious as can be, with ""Gay Animal Song"" sticking out like a tasteless,
    derivative thumb. It's not too hard to understand why Idle resorted to such reliable topics, though. Not
    much else makes a decent stab for attention.</p><p>
    
    On the island of Paranoia, says our host, people are prone to
    saying, ""Look out behind you,"" though certainly not so often or so expectantly as Idle. Another gem is found
    in ""Killing for God"", a song that bravely breaks comedy's long silence on the hypocrisy of religion. Yet
    even if the contents frequently fall short of anything that could safely be called a mark, the crumbling
    legend behind <i>The Rutland Isles</i> should be given credit for one thing: spoofing those pompous BBC
    documentaries. It's just what this world needs.</p></div>"|4060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4060-the-rutland-isles/|3.7|Brian James

    to ride, groom, feed, and fawn over their beloved stable of honeyed mares and-- if they were blessed--
    ponies. Like a homicidal marching band, they all seemed to be outfitted in the color lavender, with their
    long pigtails brushed to a tail-like sheen.  Though there was nothing overtly wrong about them (barring the
    girls who smelled gamey, I found an aura of creepiness about them, a lingering residue that I couldn't
    place but for my intuition. Isolated in their rainbows-and-unicorns world, they were perfect and inhuman.</p><p>
    
    Neon Hunk hit me in the same way. They play off the pathos of creepy/cute, exploring every crevice of
    adorableness through their unsettling, maniacally entertaining funhouse of quacking synths, an intricate
    spilling of drums, and incomprehensible, muffled lyrics. Here, though, you can identify the exact point of
    freak-out: it's the scratching, buried presence of the vocals.</p><p>
    
    Electronically altered to sound like either
    the heavy-breathing serial killer profiled on <i>Nightline</i>, or the torturous and vengeful spider/hobbit
    hybrid that lives under your bed, the vocalist (cryptically named fucking ""MOTHMASTER,"" for god's sake)
    squirms his way through your worst nightmares, alternately drooling and shooting acid from his mouth-hole.
    Live, the Milwaukee Hunks often don clashing acid-colored/acid-printed spandex, and happily, this aesthetic
    has bled into <i>Smarmymob</i>'s cover art: Across a rainbow backdrop, a repeating image of three homicidal
    and deformed kittens drills holes into our minds.  And that's fucking scary.</p><p>
    
    However, unlike the kitties, Neon Hunk have mercy on us. There's a vein of self-aware hokiness pulsing
    throughout <i>Smarmymob</i>, but the expected element of irony is tossed aside in lieu of examining the
    total absurdity of the cute ""80s underworld,"" and presumably, scaring the shit out of its torchbearers.
    The kitsch is mostly in the concept; what's left over is an unrelenting, deceptively simple pixel-chirp
    genetically similar to Blectum from Blechdom's <i>Haus de Snaus</i> or The Curtains' <i>Fast Talks</i>:
    brain-spinning calliope rhythms occasionally sprinkled with gimpy C-64 funk. (As heard in the drilling
    call-and-response trills of ""Uncle David"", or in ""Beefmastor"", which sounds like the ""Push It"" ringtone on
    somebody's blowing-up piece.)</p><p>
<i>Smarmymob</i> gets the horse-girl illuminati stamp of approval, thanks to its overarching pop element,
    aka the herky-jerky, adorably ominous, science-class melodies. Then again, it's music totally loved by
    nerdboy noize dudes the world over-- who, when you think about it, aren't that much different from a troupe
    of 13-year-old horse fanatics.  This time, however, the music is actually fun, instead of Garth Brooks'
    ""Friends in Low Places"".</p></div>"|5744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5744-smarmymob/|6.8|Julianne Shepherd

    in The Microphones-- is a lonesome voice at a backwoods sing-along, but <i>Clothes Your I's</i> is a
    campfire very unlike the chatty marshmallow roasts I attended as a kid. The atmosphere of this recording
    is a solitary ritual of stalwart self-reliance, something the listener observes from a distance, the
    view partially obscured by sulphur, fireflies, and crooked black trees.</p><p>
    
    Blau grew up in Anacortes, Washington on the San Juan Island of Fildalgo in Puget Sound; the site leaves
    an indelible mark on the album's watery geography, which emerges to the sound of a boat's distant foghorn.
    Blau situates himself within a world of ""concrete nettles"" and blackberry bushes, rainfalls, ""I's"", solitude,
    and a sun that's ""a revolutionary in the skies."" He focuses on natural forms of epiphany like burning pine,
    the dampness of ""loving"" soil underfoot, the milky rays of the sky, always working against ""the separation
    of our state from nature.""</p><p>
    
    ""Pendulum"" leads, the strongest track on the record; this catchy three-minute pop song sounds like the
    cheerier work of Neutral Milk Hotel, teetering with a folk-art sensibility: ""Worn through the fabric of
    the chest by years of a tender cheek/ Speak talk of the rainfall today and mention sunbeams burning the
    skin of yesterday.""  There's rust on the cheap old swingset in its backyard, crammed with coded language;
    on this track, it's so external, it's as though the musicians are using smoke and driftwood as part of the
    instrumentation, watching rain drop on a cymbal, a branch tap against a snare. Much like The Microphones,
    Blau excels at filling up spaces with organic sounds-- banjos, trombones, saxophones, shakers-- while
    avoiding overwrought clutter. He makes each detail seem like it was born exactly where it rests. I could
    chock this up to divining, but more pragmatically it might have to do with the fact that <i>Clothes Your
    I's</i> was laid down at Dub Narcotic with the aide of Phil Elvrum and Calvin Johnson, notorious for their
    recently spacious analog recordings.</p><p>
    
    A number of other strong moments dot the record: ""Computer"" begins with a minute of dissolving horns that
    drift in and out of sight before turning opaque dirge complete with chimes and plucking tones; ""Sunsign""
    works a brilliant samba atop a flood of percussion, horns, and boy/girl call-and-response, and ""Creepin'
    Jesus""-- with lyrics by Nate Ashley-- sounds like Will Oldham back before he was too reserved to scream
    and howl.  Following ""Creepin' Jesus"", though, <i>Clothes Your I's</i> stumbles.  ""Fasten Me to You"" has
    a cloying guitar line so detached, it dredges up images of new age gurus.  It's also one of the longest
    tracks, trailing off into a seemingly endless repetition of the choral refrain followed by guitar swell,
    ad infinitum.  On ""I Hold You"",  the same busybody sensibility remains like the remnants of a dewy hippie
    hoedown-- I keep seeing overalls for some reason. These two misfires act as a troubling dip-tych, daring
    you with their inability to resolve, falling apart into meandering jams. They're prettily pastoral in a
    way-- I dig the flute-- but if I see a tie-dye, I get well nervous.</p><p>
    
    During ""Bid-R-Bunch"", the record's tiny farewell, Blau regains his footing, going multi-track psychedelic
    like Olivia Tremor Control, raising the roof for Mother Nature.  Thirty seconds after the end, a strain of
    ""Pendulum"" starts up again, but instead of singing about the sun and shifts in luck, Blau draws on ""and to
    love..."" for a minute.  The reemergence after those less-than-stellar trip-ups acts as a reminder of how
    things went downhill for a bit, but also creates a nice loop, a fading frame of reference.</p><p>
    
    When he's at his best, Blau resembles a prophet scarfing honey in the desert, a John McPhee speaking in
    tongues, chanting in a whisper from Lord Byron's <i>Vision of Judgment</i> about out-of-tune angels.
    <i>Clothes Your I's</i> isn't as perfectly poetic or blissful, but its rag-tag patchwork is a brief and
    enjoyable ride.  It's also the closest thing to a drum circle I ever plan to attend.</p></div>"|795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/795-clothes-your-is/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    on the way to high school.  Being an idiot completely unaware of the hazards associated with handling dead
    animal flesh, he figured it'd be a great idea to pick it up and bring it along for a day of higher education.
    Unfortunately-- as I've been trying to tell Ryan, who sent me this record to review immediately upon hearing
    that I had this story-- no zany antics ever ensued.  A little absurdity in the midst of an otherwise average
    day, that's it.  Some people asked stuff like, ""Why the hell do you have a deer hoof?"" and, ""Would you mind
    getting your deer leg out of my fucking lunch?"" but basically nothing happened.  Still, it left an impression;
    harmless, real-life surrealism like watching your principal confiscate a severed leg is rarely forgotten.</p><p>
    Though this story might seem only tangentially related, the moral is simple: Everyone needs an occasional
    jolt of twisted, rhapsodic hysteria to shatter the mundanity of everyday life once in a while, something to
    pull them out of the banal mire of geriatrics in alien glasses, tech schools, gas prices, and trips to the
    supermarket.  Deerhoof, bless 'em, have been serving the public interest for five full albums now by playing
    host to these little reality-warping junkets.  With each successive release, their pop acumen becomes keener,
    a deadly undercurrent of subversive, sugar-glazed hooks to match their ferocious blasts of noise.  <i>Apple
    O'</i> is the latest head-trip from these San Fran bliss addicts, debuting as-yet unseen levels of songcraft;
    in just thirty minutes, I danced, I wept, I sang-- even the pandas they promised showed up.  In short,
    <i>Apple O'</i> performed exactly as expected, although that in itself is a little frightening.</p><p>
    While last year's <i>Reveille</i> was a similarly beautiful, bright flight, it was just unhinged enough
    so that, until its final moments, there was a lingering uncertainty as to its destination: It would either
    land in a frenetic pop playground, or allow unbridled blasts of noise to plunge it into the sea.  Now it
    seems as though Deerhoof have transmuted <i>Reveille</i>'s spurts of genius into a more cohesive, but
    slightly less astonishing consistency.  <i>Apple O'</i> is still a fascinating trip, but from the very
    beginning, it's a fairly safe bet that you'll be headed somewhere very pretty, without as much worrisome
    turbulence.  That's not a lock, naturally-- the trademark madness that's infected their earlier recordings
    hasn't vanished, just diminished-- but this is their most straightforward release to date.</p><p>
    The good news is that the band's efforts to ""normalize"" (if such a word can truly be used to describe their
    work) has reaped great dividends.  Every song they present is a staggering collage of guitars and drums,
    bells, tambourines, brass, and every other manner of beep or squeak under the sun, all falling in line in
    lush, swaying arrangements.  Now, with the added ballast of an improved song-focus, Deerhoof venture into
    deeper waters, adapting their instrumental melange to a wider variety of styles.  Dance, jazz, be-bop, 50s
    doo-wop, and standard jangle-pop all get thrown into the mix at varying points, while remaining inimitably
    in the thrall of their particular brand of noise.  All that's left is for Satomi Matsuzaki's kindergarten-cute
    vocals to add the final, unifying glaze.</p><p>
    As a treatise on love, romance and creation through a very cracked looking glass-- love as bridge (the
    card game), among other metaphors-- <i>Apple O'</i> functions loosely as a concept album, so its tighter
    cohesion might be expected.  Staccato crunch and trembling lines accompany the beautiful romance of
    ""L'Amour Stories""; ""Dummy Discards a Heart"" reprises the blistering, start/stop dynamics and killer
    percussion that made ""This Magnificent Bird Will Rise"" such a highlight of <i>Reveille</i>.  From the
    streetcorner serenade of ""Dinner for Two""-- a sort of J-Pop reincarnation of ""Earth Angel""-- to the
    solemn regret of ""Apple Bomb"", all avenues of this relatively tranquil concept are explored.  And then,
    in a definitive, almost symbolic closing statement, Deerhoof opt for a humble, unadorned acoustic gem
    (""Blue Cash"") in the vein of those prep-schoolers in Belle &amp; Sebastian, rather than any of their signature
    weirdness.  As Matsuzaki sings, ""Play on your heartstrings a song,"" its innocence perfectly conveys
    everything they've spent this entire record trying to say.</p><p>
    Once again, Deerhoof have released an album masquerading as out-of-the-blue insanity, while cleverly
    harboring nothing but the most basic, virally contagious pop around.  <i>Apple O'</i> never seems quite
    so unpredictable as <i>Reveille</i>, so it's a safe bet that if you liked <i>Reveille</i> but found it
    a bit too experimental, you'll like this one better.  Of course, in the age-old controversy between a
    steady keel of greatness or sporadic moments of true genius, genius has to take the gold, but this
    album's intense variety and sparklingly consistent pop songwriting make a great consolation prize.</p></div>"|2252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2252-apple-o/|8.3|Eric Carr

This thing puts freestyles (of sorts)     atop free jazz (of sorts), the ambient, funky, brushed-drum goop of Daddy Kev with the slow rasp of Awol One,     whose voice has the tone of a chainsmoker robbed of all gumption by constricted bloodflow and caked-over     arteries. <em>Slanguage</em>, Awol and Daddy's third full-length together, is a self-proclaimed experiment in     free jazz, as viewed through hip-hop's eyes. A sample on the record reminds us, ""The only thing about free     music is that you have a greater success of not succeeding... but the fun is when you get the good moments.""     Driving this sentiment home are Awol's frontal lobe ramblings, which unfortunately act as an album-long solo     with a success rate of about 30-70.  Still, you have to hand it to these guys for breaking out and trying     something different.</p><p>On the other hand, there's Daddy Kev, arguably one of the Los Angeles underground's most visionary producers.     He either hides the seams between his samples perfectly, or lets them show, their awkwardness draped naked     and pure across the beats. Moreover, his style exemplifies the steady bleeding of hip-hop culture into the     more highbrow aspects of art. Daddy Kev stirs classical music into his highly thumping palette of beats, and     he's adept at choosing the most beautiful and bombastic cuts.</p><p><em>Slanguage</em> is, of course, heavier on the     free jazz than ever, but he doesn't confine his music to just slapping some skronk over a 4/4 bass track.     This shit is deep. An opera diva's howl, the triumphant, pixilated theme from <em>Defender</em>, scratching     by L.A. turntablist D-Styles, and the tense crescendos of free drumming all converge in the same ten seconds     of ""Grey Skys in Psycho-Delic Rgb"". ""Reflections for Scratching Your Face Off"" is as traditional as Daddy     gets, burying scraps of stringed instruments (an upright bass solo, an unidentifiable, abstract cello--     Bartok or Kurtag, maybe) under the jubilant slapping of toms gone crazy with the boom-bap.</p>
<p>But, you know, there's still Awol's tragically tuneless whine-sing pissing all over it.</p>
<p>The reason the guys in cLOUDDEAD got away with their dreamy, stream-of-consciousness shoegazer rap is     because we were convinced they were huffing gas. Drug addiction is a good excuse for almost anything,     when you get right down to it. When people ask, ""What were you thinking when you threw your baby in the     dumpster?"" at cocktail parties, you can respond intimately, ""It was the cocaine,"" after which you and     your companion will laugh gaily and heartily into your martinis. Awol should try harder to convince us     he's on a freebasing binge, 'cause right now, much of his delivery and style comes off like apathy. ""Yeah,     thanks. That was a poem called, 'Fuck That Shit',"" he says apprehensively, at the beginning of an anti-TV,     stand-up comedy style confessional over Daddy's bluesy piano sample.</p>
<p>Even compared to Awol's     less-than-brilliant collab with Fat Jack, Propaganda, he sounds like he's phoning it in from a public     landline on frigging Guam. Lazy mumbling is part of his style-- maybe an unavoidable facet of his gravelly     voice-- but at points, you'd bet dollars he just doesn't give a shit. This is more frustrating in comparison     to tracks where his solid style almost brings it, as on ""Audio Bibles Are Written on Stone Tablet Tables""     and ""Finger Paint with Bloodlike War Paint"", and on tracks where he <em>really</em> brings it, as on the     bar-raising/hip-hop head-mocking ""Montgomery Burns' Quest for Power"".  On the latter, he proves, if only     for a brief moment, that he's capable of ripping out a rapid-fire spray of sick arrhythms.</p>
<p>It's obvious that, for the majority of <em>Slanguage</em>, Awol was gingerly exploring his own interpretation     of hip-hop/free-jazz vocals. This time around, the experiment mostly crapped out, and Daddy Kev's fantastically     freaky psychedelic genius free-jazz funky classical hybrid is left to wipe up all the ass.</p>

In his intensely pragmatic way, he sees no
    need to operate without auto-focus and isn't keen on re-framing, working the zoom, or dealing with white
    balance. Still, his immobile home videos, consisting of long-takes unintentionally akin to Bill Viola's <i>I Do
    Not Know What It Is I Am Like</i>, are compelling for their sheer boredom: they make you question how you're
    spending (or misspending) your time.  That's a high-minded consideration of home video as cultural artifact when,
    really, they're just fucking boring.</p><p>
    
    On their second full-length, ponderously titled <i>The Networks, The Circuits, The Streams, The Harmonies</i>,
    New York City's Burnside Project-- a straightforward indie rock group dabbling in electronics-- attempt to
    spice-up run-of-the-mill songwriting with hip/trip-hop beats and cricket chirps. Beats are corporeal; even if
    you aren't paying attention you can end up tapping your toe, or at best shaking your ass. Here, that's certainly
    the case: while the electronic bed adds three-dimensionality, the songs themselves, minus these accouterments, are
    encyclopedia entries for harmless college rock circa 1988.</p><p>
    
    Beyond the tepid compositional skeletons, Burnside's lyrics stand-out as the main hurdle; vocalist and
    songwriter Richard Jankovich's attempt at Malkmus-esque punning falls flat repeatedly. As he drops a ton of pop
    culture detritus, I can feel him winking, nodding, and holding his fingers up in mock quotation marks. In
    ""Assessing Your Performance"" he resorts to ""No matter what you say/ Say it don't spray it""; ""Repeat After Me""
    hinges on the wordplay of a curious two year old: ""You pass the rest with flying colors/ But can colors really
    fly?""  Jankovich's singsong delivery plays like spoken word from the uptight fiction manager at your local Barnes
    &amp; Noble, a pallid version of Barenaked Ladies for fans of NPR and The New Yorker. Better yet, it's the Eels
    gone electro, the aftermath of smoking too much herb and re-naming their cat MIDI.</p><p>
    
    It isn't a blasphemy.  This is not an entirely awful record; it starts off fine with ""He Never Knew The Benefits
    Of Caffeine"" a catchy-enough take on digital surveillance and technological overload. The second track ""Cure
    The Pulse To Begin"" features The Mendoza Line's Shannon McArdle on background vocals, transforming the otherwise
    anonymous club-kid drum clatter into a tepid Lali Puna impression.  Notably, I made it through ""Only Ordinary""--
    the one track sung entirely by McArdle-- without wanting to call the cheese police, but even that number was
    way too similar to ""Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth With Money In My Hand"".  And--
    I never thought I'd say <i>this</i> - Primitive Radio Gods do it better.</p><p>
    
    Outside that pair of tolerable moments, the center of this record slips under the weight of too many sketchy
    word choices. ""Heavy Mettle"" comes off like Beat Poetry for fans of Pete and Pete; in ""Foreign Exchange"", <i>Schoolhouse
    Rocks</i> is passed off as pained electronica: ""If the mirror lies then who can you trust?/ The painting on the wall is so full of
    torture/ Indigo, yellow, ultra violet/ Paint by numbers, count with me."" To hear scratching in this context,
    it's like watching my grandfather do the human beatbox to Dead Prez, and sadly, it just keeps going. Ultimately,
    Jankovich's fascination with one-liners reminds me of a bad waiter at TGI Friday's, trying to charm a table of girls
    with his sunny reenactment of <i>Slacker</i> ""Because it changed my life, friend. You want freedom fries with that?""</p><p>
    
    In addition to Shannon McArdle, the thirteen tracks also feature contributions from Hub Moore, who's lent his vocals
    to Hal Hartley films; Jonny Cohen, members of Elk City, and Bar/None label owner-operator Glenn Morrow also drop by.
    The hyperbolic I-am-Allan-Ginsberg-writing-opaque-stuff-for-Dylan's-<i>Desire</i> liner notes were penned by novelist and
    Feelies fan Rick Moody under the pseudonym ""Tyrone Duffy""-- Moody wrote the notes as a song-by-song response to the
    album, and, per usual, he likes to hear himself write:</p><p>
    
    ""Get your camera obscura, construct the boys in the loft with the baseball games on even if they don't actually
    exist except as an image entity, because isn't hurting no one, and these frames construct a filmstrip about a dog's
    lungs and car crashes and the sixteen decisions, and, man, that's an uplifter.   Listen to the words, as the mighty
    river flows past.""</p><p>
    
    That's sic.  Which is sick.</p><p>
    
    Burnside Project's one-page mentions that their songs <i>may</i> show up on MTV's <i>The Real World</i> and <i>Road Rules</i>;
    that they're so excited to be ""optioned"" by these shows is indicative of their intent: as the barely audible background blip
    for one or two vanilla conversations between badly adjusted, over-privileged roommates, it makes perfect sense.
    Still, that press byte is a sad reminder that these guys believe in what they're doing-- for all the blundering wordplay,
    this is more than a joke to the Burnside Project: don't let them weasel out of their bad punchlines with ""You just don't get it.""  We
    do, guys-- we just don't <em>like</em> it.</p><p>

    Wild Style for pasty 8-bit geeks?</p><p>
    
    Make out music for toasters?</p><p>
    
    Reviewing electronic music, you notice certain descriptions beg repeating as commonalities in various sub-genres begin to show themselves;
    for example, elements of electro and/or hip-hop cropped up on every IDM record released in the last year.  Which is not to say things
    have grown stale, to suggest that tinkerers like Solar X and Team Doyobi-- whose sounds share common roots with Com.a's
    recent release on Tigerbeat6, the hydraulics-and-birthday cake <i>Shot of Love</i>-- are flogging a dead effects processor. It's more a cosmic
    coincidence that these artists refer back to the same points in their past, sharing common history through the technology that raised them.
    Now, they're old enough to apply this knowledge during twister and dodgeball.</p><p>
<i>Shot of Love</i> is Com.a's third solo disc since the disillusion of his former group, Rom=Pari. The beats here
    bring to mind a dozen artists, ranging from the unavoidable (Aphex Twin, Squarepusher) to the more selective (the first thing that came to mind:
    the <i>Electric Chicken Music Vol. 1</i> compilation, on Worm Interface). Unlike <i>Dream and Hope</i>-- his self-released sophomore disc, whose
    breaks sound big, gritty and closer to the frontline-- the percussion here finds itself playing second fiddle more often than not.</p><p>
    
    The biggest exception is the much-touted ""Air Scratch Filter"", the lead cut on January's <i>One More Story</i> 12"".  It's a jet-engine backdraft that
    hurls a heated scratch battle headlong into the craziest 4/4 piledriver this side of an Ultimate Cheerleading competition. But by the time the
    sepia-toned intermission ""Am I Wrong"" rolls around, the beats have been beaten back, hidden under the floorboards, giving the melodies
    room to get busy and multiply, resulting in heartbreaking kaleidoscopes that propel tracks like ""Crime Of Mr. Com.a"", a stunning grid of
    splintered machine drums and tender analog harmonies (which only grow more abrasive and pained on the following number, ""Fickle Grief"").</p><p>
    
    But the mood isn't all rainy days and weeping robots; just look at that cover. How sad can a heavily armed robo-baby in his sexual prime be? It's
    the sound of cybernetics that provides the inspiration for the title cut, a mobile assault field training exercise that inexplicably finds
    itself on the losing side of a skirmish with electro-wielding interstellar arms dealers.  Just try not to imagine a 9-foot cyborg drinking 18 gallons
    of caffeine and endorphins when the blitzkrieg melody on ""Sick Of It"" goes off the deep end, that's all I'm saying.  For this great change of pace,
    ""Make My Day"" takes the cake, doing the Space Raiders one better with a ditzy pop riff that must be the soundtrack of every horny android
    slumber party from here to the beaches of Neo-Tokyo.</p><p>
    
    Com.a isn't the first act to use vintage videogames as stock for his sound banks, and he won't be the last. The gleeful drill n' bass-meets-urban thump
    framework that supports <i>Shot of Love</i> is a well-tested infrastructure, with a safe expiration date. Perhaps aware of the need to
    break away from the pack, Com.a infuses the beats with a precocious personality, one that saturates even the densest layers of beat sequences with a
    youthful Nintendo charm, although the twisted, <i>Gummo</i>-quoting closer, ""Hug Luv Suck"", resides in a completely different sector of the
    subconscious. IMost of the cuts sound fresh, plugging away like Dozers as they skitter through shirting tempos and moods: there's an emotional
    investment here that makes <i>Shot of Love</i> fly, a measured amount of representin' backed by a whole lot of love, assuring this album a place in
    discmen all over Saturn.</p></div>"|1553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1553-shot-of-love/|7.2|Mark Martelli

    all night: chainsaws, shotguns, beartraps, piranhas, you name it.  Hippie said he came up to see what was
    going on, and the guy yelled all kinds of crap at him.  Never opened the door, though.</p><p>
    
    Gossett: What kind of crap's he yelling?</p><p>
    
    Lou: Stuff about some album being so ""brilliantly bonkers"" he couldn't take it anymore. Something about,
    ""Is everyone in North Dakota as original as June Panic?  No wonder you never hear about that place!"" Then
    something about how June Panic was ""so free of the shirt-tugging insecurity of hipster dinks.""</p><p>

    Gossett: He's a pile of melted Skittles for all I care.</p><p>
    
    Lou: The hippie neighbor asked him to turn the music down, and Mr... Bowens, he turns it up, exclaiming
    ""yes!"" after certain lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Gossett: Did the hippie catch any of those?</p><p>
    
    Lou: A few songs about Jesus.  Mr. Bowens said they ""mopped the floor with the Danielson Family.""</p><p>
    
    Gossett: May be a mob thing.</p><p>
    
    Lou: One of the Jesus lyrics was ""the carpenter got married to a board."" Uh, another was: ""Time chooses you
    because you are the one plus one."" The hippie heard lyrics about birth being an eviction, and about how
    learning to walk was really learning to walk alone. Through the door, Mr Bowens was exclaiming how ""freshly
    crushing"" these, uh, sentiments were.</p><p>
    
    Gossett: Have the freakshits taken over the proverbial henhouse, Lou?  Have they?</p><p>
    
    Lou: Not on my watch, they didn't. More yammering: Bowens said Mr. Panic's voice could ""dither from gorgeous
    to awkward in the same syllable,"" and asked him to ""imagine a so-cute-it's-ugly, or so-ugly-it's-cute love-child
    of Jeff Buckley and Jad Fair."" Then he said: ""Imagine a male Belinda Carlisle, imagine Smurff Mangum, imagine
    Keebler Oberst.""</p><p>
    
    Gossett: You running checks on these names?</p><p>
    
    Lou: Nothing's turned up yet, though the hippie recognized a bunch of references to a Bob Dylan, which we
    learned is an alias for one Robert Zimmerman out of Minnesota. Mr. Bowens said that Panic was ""a spacier
    basement Dylan"", that his band The Silver Sound had ""synthesized <i>Desire</i>, <i>Slow Train Coming</i>,
    and the Lanois-produced latter-day albums."" The arrangements on the country-rock songs, he said, ""were as
    breezy and foreboding as the last two Bonnie 'Prince' Billy records."" Lastly, the hippie had to endure a
    speech about how the song ""Hung-Up"" was ""among the finest reconciling-a-dead-love chronicles ever, ever.""
    Bowens wailed the chorus, ""We tried and that is all we know: we tried/ We die and that is all we know: We
    die.""</p><p>
    
    Gossett: This guy sounds like a fruit.  How many more lives will this confounded rock music take before
    somebody props a law up against it?</p><p>
    
    Lou: Sir, you're standing on a note!</p><p>
<i>[Gossett wipes revolting gore off the note and reads it aloud.]</i></p><p>
    
    Gossett: ""Dear Cruel World: I have never beheld anything like this turbo-ambitious concept album about Jesus,
    sex, childbirth, and Megadeath. As intelligent as it is insane, this album easily trumps Panic's decent recent
    work, and buries his tinny racket dating back to the late 80s. <i>Baby's Breadth</i> is constantly interesting.
    'Giving Up the Ghost' is the 'Meat Is Murder' of anti-circumcision anthems, beginning with the call 'Don't
    circumcise your baby!' and ranging through lines such as, 'These puritans in fear mutilate children and call
    it hygiene.' The song features choruses to be sung by both grown-ups and 'grown-downs' about 'medi-sin.'
    Panic's argument is that boys get clipped because adults are lonely and dead.""</p><p>
    
    Lou: Fat chance that gibberish gets played on the radio between ""Bump Your Horny Parts Up Against My Horny
    Parts"" and ""Have You Driven a Ford Lately"", eh, boss?</p><p>
    
    Gossett: There's more: ""On 'Honey Careen', Panic sings of meat that flowers and sucks rain. Truly he is
    from a place where bees flock and birds swarm. The album is divided into chapters, and Chapter Five,
    entitled 'The Wondering Womb or God's Hysterical Pregnancy' consists of a trilogy on par with any trio
    from Love's psychedelic-doom flagship <i>Forever Changes</i>.  'Sex Is for Children' kicks off with the
    line, 'Fuck for your beautiful children,' and gets bolder from there. 'Death Is Gonna Part You' is like an
    existential children's song from some lost, Kierkegaard-scripted episode of <i>Sesame Street</i>. 'Even
    when your love is true/ Death will part you,' Panic sings, trying to get this assertion to be viewed as
    comforting, while he hammers home a notion of self becoming something better later, 'a light.' The finale,
    'If Enough of Us Die', argues that we could stand to lose a few of us dowdy planet-crowders. Get ready for
    lyrics that proclaim, 'It takes faith just to sleep/ That's for sure/ It's a monster,' and possibly my
    favorite closing line from an album since the end of Pavement's <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i>: 'If
    enough of us die and the rest take to drinking/ You know we might find that the world is not so unkind/
    Only restless."" June Panic is the opposite of cool. This album is crafted as if he's the one who came up
    with Shakespeare's equation that sound plus fury eventually equals diddly. <i>Baby's Breadth</i> so deserves
    the wide audience it will probably never get. You already know these songs. The sun has already hit its
    half-life. Goodbye, you nation of gawkers. Return to sender, etc.""</p><p>
    
    Lou: Funny how this guy Bowers wrote out those italics on his suicide note. What a flake.</p><p>

    some damn fine records. You can dwell all you like on the middling Datsuns or the hopelessly plagiaristic
    Vines, but when push comes to shove it's hard to ignore the stripped-down super-hooks of The Strokes, The
    White Stripes or... okay, so that's pretty much it for inspiring garage-rock.  Nevertheless!  While never
    particularly revelatory or original, the best of it has consisted of tight, punchy pop songs that take up
    permanent residence in your cerebral cortex.  Even if you haven't listened to ""Fell in Love with a Girl""
    in over a year, you probably still remember the melody.</p><p>
    
    Toronto's Tangiers may, at first glance, represent an archetypal, derivative garage band. They've got most
    of the particulars in the bag; the tousled hairdos, the thrift-store suits, the cigarettes and alcohol. But
    throughout most of <i>Hot New Spirits</i> they both wisely and endearingly set themselves apart from the
    flock, twisting the garage formula to give it a new, refreshing looseness and dynamic without sacrificing
    the immediacy that the style thrives on. Incorporating a Stones-y rawness and a violently jangly two-guitar
    attack into the standard lo-fi muddle, the band ends up sounding... well, a lot like the Buzzcocks, really.</p><p>
    
    I'm sorry!  I realize every single garage-rock record review to date has referenced any one of countless
    punk and/or pop bands of the past, but look, we might as well face right now that <i>no</i> garage band of
    the 21st Century has yet really come up with their own distinct sound.  Tangiers aren't breaking the mold
    or anything.  And while I'm at it, I might as well say they aren't a <i>direct</i> clone of Shelley/Devoto--
    frontman Josh Reichmann's vocals aren't nearly as nasal, and the band is certainly less high-strung and
    unquestionably (North) American.  The influence, however, remains undeniable.  And ain't nothing wrong with
    that.  At least, not when the outcome is this solid.</p><p>
    
    One thing that really makes this record-- that is, aside from the out-and-out stunning pop songs-- is the
    sincerity.  These guys don't have the production value, fashion sense or, if we're judging by the artwork,
    desire to strike commercial gold.  In fact, they lack every extraneous element that makes an MTV-friendly
    garage-rock band: there's no bratty attitude, no sneering vocals, and-- sorry, gents-- no ""cute one"".  The
    focus here, absolute front-and-center, is always the song itself.</p><p>
    
    The livid, stormy ""Here Come the Pieces"",
    the claustrophobic Dolls-style jam ""Anxiety"", and the almost anthemic ""Ca Va Cool"" are all concise, stirring
    send-ups that demonstrate the group's dazzling gift for melody and dynamics, each finding a subtle climax
    that demands repeat listens. Even when the writing isn't quite up to their usual standards-- which, I must
    say, is strikingly rare-- Tangiers' bug-eyed delivery and energetic Red Bull overdrive make the songs a
    welcome listen.</p><p>
    
    Americas, here is your garage-rock underdog.</p></div>"|7934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7934-hot-new-spirits/|8.2|Matt Stephens

I'm not being condescending, I swear-- they really
    <i>are</i> cute; any of us who've picked up a Gibson knockoff were probably musical Silly Putty at one point
    or another.  As a peace offering to illustrate my complete lack of condescension, I fully disclose that my
    high school band would frequently cover Pavement, AC/DC, and Phish.  You can only imagine the flipper-baby
    monstrosities that were our original songs (here's a taste: one was called ""Jabberwocky"").</p><p>
    
    Of course, not too many of us had teenage bands that metamorphosed into a top-of-the-line pop act like
    The Shins, so we haven't had to suffer the overproud-Mom embarrassment of having these early days publicly
    released.  Omnibus Records is happy to play that evil role, however, re-releasing the full-length effort by
    Flake Music, an early incarnation of The Shins.   <i>When You Land Here, It's Time to Return</i> is far from
    an amateur souvenir of Battle of the Bands-won studio time, but at times it unflinchingly illustrates a group
    that wears its influences on its sleeve like a stock car wears its sponsors.</p><p>
    
    ""Burnt Valve"" is the most obvious culprit, a song so enthralled with <i>There's Nothing Wrong with Love</i>
    (check out the Dug-ish nasal ""yeaahhhhhh"" and extended mid-fi jamout) that it makes Flake Music sound like
    those weirdos that sit in the art museum all day, drawing exact replicas of famous portraits.  But hell,
    it's such a believable, lovable forgery, only a tyrannical dictator could hate it; Martsch himself would
    probably be fooled into thinking he wrote it.  And if recorded sound is the canvas art of the future, it's
    gonna take a pretty sharp team of curators to separate it from a precious BTS original.</p><p>
    
    Later in the program, other giants of mid-90s indie rock serve as occasional muse to Flake Music-- on ""Structo""
    it's Weezer; on ""The Shins"" (yes, they had a song called The Shins), it's Guided by Voices.  So the record
    would serve nicely as an on-the-cheap retro capsule soundtrack, should I ever make a movie of my high school
    years.  And given the 1997 original born-on date of the album, and the considerable zest with which each
    tribute is performed, the affair is extremely forgivable.  This is, after all, the kind of bedroom music
    Pitchfork was conceived to back in the day, so don't mind us if we feel a wee bit nostalgic.</p><p>
    
    Most of the floundering here is due to frontman James Mercer still hunting for a comfortable voice.
    Ironically, opening track ""Spanway Hits"" captures much of The Shins' formula right off the bat, Mercer
    straining for the upper registers and the band all perky New Mexico sunshine.  It's as clear to the listener
    as it apparently was to the band that ""Spanway Hits"", and the other crystal ball moment, ""Deluca"", marked
    the correct path for he and his mates to travel, even if neither tune approaches the lowest rung of <i>Oh,
    Inverted World!</i></p><p>
    
    That's not to say that fervent Shin-lickers won't love the dickens out of Flake Music, and that less
    committed Mercerites won't find something to love in its thirty-minute runtime.  I might poke a bit of fun
    at the album's indie-classic sponge act, but playa-hatas can't touch the writer of a diamond like ""New
    Slang"", a song so good I didn't even hold its McDonald's co-option against it, instead just submitting to
    the subconscious urge to eat french fries whenever it played.  While the future of The Shins is highly
    cloudy, most indie-pop bands tending to be one-album-stand types preying upon our ears, it's gratifying
    to know that their pubertal stage was far from painfully awkward.</p></div>"|3079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3079-when-you-land-here-its-time-to-return/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

    There's something running through it that broadcasts timelessness and defies genre constraints-- quite a
    feat, considering how M. Ward's previous outings had pegged him as a modern-day alt-country troubadour,
    tied to tradition despite promise that suggested he might one day transcend its confines.  For
    <i>Transfiguration of Vincent</i>, M. Ward has invited collaborators who bring full flesh to his music,
    landing at the nexus of melody-drenched pop, Delta blues, Wall of Sound glow, ragtime, Appalachian folk,
    and about a half-dozen other styles.  With this album, Ward moves onto the same block as Sparklehorse,
    Pinetop Seven, Calexico, Lambchop, and a host of other artists who draw from backwoods phantasmagoria
    and disparate genres.</p><p>
    
    Over the past year or so, I've been really drawn into the world that musicians like Ward inhabit.  There's
    a sort of spiritual gravity to music that exists in the cracks between genres and passing movements, and
    because it can mix-and-match the entire history of music, it's an aesthetic that's unlikely to run short
    of ideas any time soon.  This album manages to cross a great deal of terrain without actually feeling
    eclectic-- there are too many elements working in concert with each other for true stylistic shifts to
    occur-- even while containing variety in spades.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't hurt matters that Ward's singing and writing has developed into something truly special and
    unique.  On the swinging flamenco blues number ""Sad, Sad Song"", Ward's voice is an impossible blend of
    gravel and silk as he croons, ""I went to my momma/ I said momma, please/ What do you do when your true
    love leaves?/ She said the hardest thing in the world to do/ Is to find somebody who believes in you.""
    They may be an acquired taste for some, but Ward's pipes are a perfect fit for his songs, moving through
    the decades with the same ease as his music, and taking on music hall boisterousness and bluesy weariness
    by turns, always full of soul.</p><p>
    
    On the instrumental ""Duet for Guitars #3"", Ward takes things to the back porch for a brilliant, kinetic
    moment of levity, but otherwise, <i>Transfiguration of Vincent</i> is laden with heavy emotions and musings
    on death, loss and violence.  ""Helicopter"" whirs with energy, bounding on a steady rhythm, Ward expounding
    on some sort of fantasy about rescuing innocents from the violence of the world.  Through the nostalgic
    haze of ""Outta My Head"", amidst fluttering organs and synths, Ward sings, ""A playful little kitten/ Met
    a playful little bird/ And then off with its head/ Off with its head/ Oh my.""  And his rough falsetto pulls
    all the emotion from the chorus of ""Undertaker"", where, over an ornate bed of acoustic guitar, theremin and
    muffled violin, he moans, ""If you're gonna leave/ You better call the undertaker/ Take me under, undertaker/
    Take me home.""</p><p>
    
    There are moments on <i>Transfiguration of Vincent</i> for which words fail-- particularly the cover of
    David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"", where Ward's low-key, acoustic delivery reveals a surprisingly emotional,
    fragile piece-- and while that may be an extremely uncomfortable position for a music reviewer, for a
    listener, it's the best place you could possibly be.  I would say ""enjoy it while it lasts,"" but you've
    got all the time in the world.</p></div>"|8579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8579-transfiguration-of-vincent/|8.3|Joe Tangari

    sound like an inspirational speaker, stalking the hotel conference room stage during some ""Confront the 'Baddest Poet' Within"" seminar.
    Maybe I get that image from knowing that Sole is the ""business bad boy and catalyst"" of the Anticon hip-hop collective, the guy who
    can count the coins and keep his peers' chins up in the thankless world of underground rapping.  He has self-confidence to spare, but
    knows you've gotta be willing to work for it.</p><p>
    
    On earlier records like <i>Bottle of Humans</i> and <i>Learning to Walk</i>, Sole varied the pace, taking it easy a few times, but on
    his new disc he's jogging back and forth, dishing out rhymes thick as weeds, and rapping at a speed that's a half-tick too fast for
    the average brain to parse comfortably.  The lyrics are dense, but they're honest and blunt: he bares himself on this record, to keep
    with the trademark emotional nakedness of Anticon artists.  If you aren't rhyming about hating your family, losing your job or
    beating off, you might as well quit and hand in your poetry encoding ring (he even slips in his non-MC name ""Tim"" to lower the mask
    a little further).</p><p>
    
    Kicking off with ""Da Baddest Poet"", Sole fesses up to every cultural crime a white man can commit.  He's a slacker (""Jobs ain't nothing but
    free pens and long distance calls""), a yuppie (""The dog got birth control"") and an unrepentant wigger who's ""wanted to be black
    since age fourteen,"" though lyric for lyric, he harkens more to the Native Americans.  Like them, he ""learned to eat pain like a sundae
    snack.""  We later learn his hairline's receding, though he's only in his mid-twenties; the guy is so honest, he could make his own mirror cry.</p><p>
    
    Still, you have to break yourself to grow, and you'll never hear Sole drop his self-confident act-- he's cutting himself down just to make
    himself stronger, and when he's done with that he turns his anger around to the rest of the world: stupid wars, the corrupt politics
    of fighting terrorism, the thoughtless pursuit of nine-to-five success.  Yet the relentlessness is his shortcoming; Sole never stops,
    slows down or mixes things up, and an hour of this can wear you out.  It's too frenetic to have much atmosphere, and it doesn't have the
    variety of, say, Sage Francis' more intriguing <i>Personal Journals</i>.  The beats-- from producers like Odd Nosdam, Jel and Alias--
    are good, but not the most exciting or head-expanding work you'll hear from these guys.</p><p>
    
    Sole never finds a track that just plain kills, like ""Famous Last Words"" from <i>Bottle of Humans</i>.  People take sides between
    Anticon and Def Jux as if they have some kind of underground East Coast/West Coast rivalry, as if Sole and El-P will face off, call each
    other ""honkey"", then run home and write in their diaries.  But if it's a free country, would it be fair to prefer Anticon
    when they record for Mush Records, where the electronic/ambient mood wards off the brash low-fidelity of their own label?</p><p>
    
    Whether you dig it all or prefer him in small doses, Sole has never sounded more keyed up, heady and on target than he does on <i>Selling
    Live Water</i>, and its wrap-up is almost anthemic.  Ignoring the strangely soft-hitting epilogue ""Ode to the War on Terrorism"", Sole ends
    the album with a title track, one that sets off the light show and hammers home his message.  He plows through dizzying images of bullshit,
    laying out career advice, war criticism, slams on ""hip-hop nazis"" and everyone else who got in his way, or who could ever get in yours.  An
    electric guitar loop soars and the choir kicks in: this is Sole's ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"". He's taken some
    blows, the world looks tough and the balance of man and nature is fucked sideways, but he's triumphant, and he owns his future.
    And he's here to say that you can too.</p></div>"|7319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7319-selling-live-water/|7.3|Chris Dahlen

    a Star Above the Manger Tonight</em>, that said something like, ""God made us stop for a while after this
    one."" There's a kernel of truth there. <em>Manger</em> came at the end of a intensely creative cycle for Red
    Red Meat, where they evolved from the noisy blues-punk band of their self-titled debut, through the
    70s-informed grunge of <em>Jimmywine Majestic</em>, and then up an even steeper arc with the sound
    experiments of <em>Bunny Gets Paid</em>. The Red Red Meat of <em>Star Above the Manger</em> sounded like a
    band heavy with noise and density, ready to implode.</p><p>
    
    Tim Rutili's post-Meat project, Califone, which kept most of his previous band's members, started somewhere
    near <em>Star Above the Manger</em> but gradually drifted toward calmer waters. With Califone's second EP and
    debut full-length, <em>Roomsound</em>, Rutili was able to explore his deep love of folk music, and he
    alternated his own take on the murder ballad tradition with jagged rock songs that touched on late-period
    Meat. Lately, another side of Califone has emerged, an atmospheric improv outfit that released a record of
    film music called <em>Deceleration One</em>.</p><p>
    
    Califone's sonic thumbprint seems well suited to soundtrack work, but the instrumental side of the band,
    while unique, isn't what makes it great.  Califone lives and dies on the strength of Tim Rutili's songs.
    Rutili has confessed his love for Harry Smith's <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i> collection, and a
    large number of his recent songs have been informed by those ancient styles.  This development hasn't
    always been for the best.  One essential feature of folk music is that it has be easy to remember, and a
    certain melodic immediacy and simplicity helps songs get passed down through generations.  While Califone's
    work has been consistently strong, I've sometimes felt like Rutili's focus on folk has shortchanged his
    melodic gifts.  <em>Quicksand/Cradlesnakes</em> is the fleshed-out and focused songwriter's showcase I've
    been hoping for.</p><p>
    
    In a way, <em>Quicksand/Cradlesnakes</em> is like a summation of all that Califone is about, and the first
    three tracks alone touch on almost everything the band has done to date. The opening ""One"" is a spacy
    one-minute instrumental interlude that would sound great behind an experimental film, and it bleeds into
    the slow country of ""Horoscopic.amputation.honey"", which is built around Rutili's piano and groaning
    harmonies.  Halfway through, the track evolves into anthemic gospel-tinged rock in the tradition of the
    Stones' ""Shine a Light"", driving the song home with a fantastic refrain that features the typically
    mysterious line, ""Amputated years are growing back a new shade.""  Then comes the gorgeous ""Michigan
    Girls"", so welcoming it almost seems like a nursery rhyme, mostly just voice and guitar, but with nice
    cello swells and gentle percussion.  The delicacy and subtlety of the percussion throughout might have
    something to do with Perishable house producer Brian Deck sitting this one out (Graeme Gibson of Boas
    recorded and mixed).</p><p>
    
    The remainder of <em>Quicksand/Cradlesnakes</em> continues to blend styles and refine previously established
    directions. ""Your Golden Ass"" is a rough, overdriven boogie track demonstrating that Califone haven't
    completely abandoned their punk roots.  The old, weird American vibe of ""Million Dollar Funeral"" finds
    Rutili writing his very best song in the familiar style, with an old-timey tune worthy of the greats,
    performed with just voice, guitar and a fiddle doubling on melody. ""When Leon Spinx Moved to Town"" is
    a slow, black, moody rock song that sounds a bit like ""Bunny Gets Paid"", only more direct and forceful.
    The midtempo ""Vampiring Again"" is as relaxed and immediately catchy as mid-70s Fleetwood Mac, but Lindsay
    Buckingham would never have thought to add the hyper-distorted powerchord fills.  In the end, the
    consistency of this album in the face of such diversity is inspiring.  The songs, interludes, pacing and
    sequencing are all as they should be, helping to make <em>Quicksand/Cradlesnakes</em> Califone's best
    record.</p></div>"|11697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11697-quicksandcradlesnakes/|8.6|Mark Richardson

    who really shouldn't have been singing.  Traditionally speaking, I'm talking about frustrated soul
    singers from Jagger on down, but off-kilter frontmen have been falling into place since Lou Reed
    first pursed his lips.  Especially in recent years: Mike Patton and Craig Wedren, for instance,
    could each take up opera, but, why would they when rock is so accommodating and comparatively
    unlimited.  As long as musicians are willing to steal outright from everything fresh and beautiful
    in this world, rock has no expiration date. As rigid as the form often seems, the fact that
    it never excludes solely on the basis of style or natural ability is one of its saving graces.</p><p>
    As a singer, Jeff Hanson should've been a lot of things.  He probably should've been
    a chick, for one-- how his kind of breathy falsetto can come from any throat with an Adam's
    apple attached is far beyond me.  His voice is presumably what first caught Kill Rock
    Stars' attention; it was the first unsolicited demo to result in a KRS signing in
    years.  Considering Hanson's barely-legal age and sky-high range, he seems like a lock
    for emo stardom, and his old band M.I.J. did the ""soaring"" thing as well as anybody else,
    for years.  Which is why the sharp turn toward traditional pop on his first solo outing <i>Son</i>
    is pretty striking, both in terms of how perfectly he nails the archetype and how otherworldly it
    sounds coming from those pipes.</p><p>
    For its first 20 seconds, <i>Son</i> is nearly bland, the acoustic opener ""Hiding Behind
    the Moon"" cribbing liberally and shamelessly from that old ""More Than Words"" power-
    ballad strum (complete with pensive guitar-slappin').  When Hanson's voice glides in,
    though, it easily fills in the space between every cliché with an oddly elfin assurance.  It
    helps that his phrasing and arrangements are laser-guided, but it's that
    glassy timbre that makes the sinuous rub of descending harmony and ascending melody
    in the chorus so goddamn gorgeous.  Without employing any vocal tricks or
    theatrics, Hanson does unheard-of things with almost every syllable; even the
    background vocals get the magic-larynx treatment.  On the graceful rocker ""You Are The
    Reason"" he could be mistaken for a synthesizer's wash, and the la-la-la's in ""As Honest As A
    Liar Can Be"" sound like the eerie exhalations of some angelic backup trio rising to
    heaven right after a tour bus crash.</p><p>
    Which is not to say any of this is at all heavy or depressing: Hanson gets his
    share of Elliot Smith comparisons, and they're all right on, especially when it's just Jeff
    and his guitar (as the majority of these songs are).  The sharp Anglo pronunciation and
    aloof minor-key melodies make the influence a little too pronounced on some of the
    songs, but luckily, they adhere to Smith's standards of quality as well.  Hanson's distinguishing
    characteristics are just as striking, however, as he manages to strip away just about every
    ounce of angst and damage, leaving the pure uplift of pop.</p></div>"|3732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3732-son/|8.1|Brendan Reid

Pascal, that practical     Frenchman, once countered atheism by suggesting one might as well believe in God, because really, what do you have to lose?     Well Blaise, our dignity, for starters, and that's plenty.  Art-funk luminaries Liars and schizo-psychers Oneida aim to     embody the Truth and the Light, and put your faith in them if you must, but neither brings quite enough here to justify this     record's proclamation; however these NYC evangelists see it, this split CD will not find many converts.</p><p>Given the dynamism of both groups, there's a surprising dearth of gripping sounds on <em>Atheists, Reconsider</em>.  The     greatest disappointment is that Liars-- the more easily and readily revered prophets-- are mostly at fault for the record's     shortcomings, while Oneida, whom I'd pegged as a babbling cadre of zealots, are the true saviors.  And I hate to paint this in     terms of a competition, but given the nature of the disc, one band's going to show up the other; it's inevitable.</p><p>Each act puts forth three tracks: a pair of still-warm newborns and a third cover version, of the other band's material.     Even the least imaginative of their followers can surely see the potential in this arrangement: Oneida could have     re-christened ""Every Day is a Child with Teeth"" in acid, turning its frayed nerves and pent-up disorder into the penultimate     bad trip, a seven-minute sermon on a simple commandment.  Liars had the chance to force the spacey lilt of ""Rose and Licorice""     to submit to their brutal, gladiatorial clatter, but the chance for such clean juxtaposition of styles comes along just     this side of ""never"", and when it finally comes time for the bands to clash head on, they play it completely straight.     ""Letdown"" just scratches the surface-- creatively speaking, this is a a sharp plummet.  No friction, no sparks; each     band cozies up to the songs, makes nice with them and pretty soon, it's hard to care who did what to whom, since these new     testaments aren't as exciting.</p>
<p>Still, the revelation is noteworthy, in that both cover tracks stand proudly in the face of the source material, among the     better work in each band's repertoire (a lofty perch with no room for the pair of new Liars tracks).  On one hand, they deserve     credit for steadfastly adhering to a concept, never buckling to expectation, mostly ignoring their audience.  The <em>Fins to     make Us More Fish-Like</em> EP barely hinted at this transition: ""All in All a Careful Party"" and ""Dorothy Taps the Toe of the     Tinman"" sound nothing like Liars' established approach to post-post-punk.  The band have turned a corner into     pure experimentalism here: melody is a thing of the past, a relic, forsaken in favor of strange assemblages, noises and     rhythms.  The vital, spastic energy that flowed through their earlier material is drugged, twitching and mumbling in a hazy murmur.</p>
<p>Careful study peels back the layers of these tracks, and lends an appreciation for their place within the scope of the record.     Though the Liars' cuts are supremely inaccessible, moody pieces, their chaotic, indecipherable babel plays against Oneida's monolithic     tower.  Oneida set their cuts on full-blast, turning out some of the most evocative music they've ever produced.  ""Privilege"" is     a pummeling, concussive blow to the senses, consuming itself before it has a chance to wear the listener down; it's straightforward,     driving psych-rock on par with any of their early work, though it still pales-- like most of their material-- to ""Fantastic Morgue"".</p>
<p>If the whole record is just one twisted parable, ""Fantastic Morgue"" is its enlightening conclusion.  An epic of fuzzed-out rock     melodrama like this requires some faith-- if you run toward the light sans a pure heart, its blinding riff might reduce you     to ashes.  Lyrics like ""One if by land/ And seven by sea/ Take away ten/ You're still ugly"" shatter the pretentious nature of     this mostly secular psalm, admitting that concept exceeds execution on <em>Atheists, Reconsider</em>, despite occasional     moments of conviction.</p>

Nothing would thrill me more than to tell you
    these sons of Montreal play calypso or spin Goa trance, but the dismal truth has, in essence, already
    been spoken. Of course they're a fucking garage band.  Sheesh.</p><p>
<i>Star Witness</i>, out on Oh! Tonito-- a newish Michigan label that appears to be a Le Grand Magistery
    offshoot-- is that saddest of things: a perfunctory run through a waning fad. Which, in a review, usually
    calls for an equally lazy round of unflattering similes, commencing...now!  The Snitches are like the
    Hives without the evil wit, Mooney Suzuki without the electric sweat, the Raveonettes without the elegance,
    the Strokes without the entitlement. In fact, the only compliment I can pay this band, and the reason I
    find myself straining to say anything nice at all, is that their mediocrity never seems calculated. It's
    not a ploy or a gambit-- the Snitches make genuinely, honestly shitty music.</p><p>
    
    The album's opener, ""December 21"", is a rote four-chorder with a remarkably honest opening statement: ""I
    tried to get it right/ But I'm a lazy boy.""  Things pick up somewhat by the third track, ""Right Before
    My Eyes"", wherein the lead Snitch works up a glammy sneer a la Bowie by-way-of Spacehog by-way-of the
    Interpreters. All hope is then promptly dashed with the arrival of towering twin embarrassments: ""Willie"",
    a slick bore that sounds like all the other Canadians rockers pogoing across MTV2, and the dread ""Perfect Gentleman"".
    This one starts with lonesome-seagull sounds (a class A felony in itself), segues into a pseudo-Latin centerpiece,
    then throws it away, suffering a brief attack of fuzzy chorus before bringing the fucking seagulls back.</p><p>
    
    The band fares a tad better on ""Sugar Mommy"", a straight-up appeal for female sponsorship with a nice
    vintage whiff to it. In fact, it might generally behoove the Snitches to go full-on retro: the bluesy ""Gets Me Down""
    and ""Swallow"" are the best tracks on <i>Star Witness</i>, and not coincidentally the least faddish. The
    blues might also break the Snitches of their abstract poetry habit, which at one point sent me to the
    liner notes to make sure these guys are not Quebecois. Lines like ""This must be cool/ I can pretend that
    we are one and that we laugh,"" and ""Slut Shark oozes wax across the dance floor"" scan like lobotomized Robert
    Pollard prose translated to French and back.</p><p>
    
    The Snitches' final damnation is their overreaching meta-concept of ratting people out. Their name figures in at least
    two songs, and a murky promotion on the band's web site invites you to ""finger a Snitch.""  Thanks but no thanks,
    I'm keeping my nose well clean of this baby powder.</p></div>"|7301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7301-star-witness/|3.4|Michael Idov

Whether
    playing the role of the lo-fi pioneer, the boisterous noise-making prankster, or the darkly smirking
    balladeer, Callahan has always made music brimming with tension and complexity. When Callahan is at his
    best, a squealing, distorted guitar can break your heart, a rumination on death can make you laugh, and
    a joke can make you hate yourself. In a sense, Callahan's best work is often the most difficult to listen
    to-- a tapestry of revelation, humor, despair, beauty, and noise hardly qualifies as easy listening.</p><p>
<i>Supper</i>, Callahan's eleventh proper album as Smog, is a lovely collection of songs. Alternating
    between confident mid-tempo rockers and acoustic portraits of domestic bliss, this is without doubt one
    of his most accessible efforts to date. Which is exactly why it's not his best. Though certainly not a
    bad album, <i>Supper</i> lacks the unique, often disturbing touch that makes the best of Callahan's work
    so compelling. And though the more subversive side of Callahan's songwriting does occasionally manifest
    itself in more subdued ways, it's not enough to render the album anything more than pleasant.</p><p>
    Callahan opens <i>Supper</i> with ""Feather by Feather"", a song that bears a striking resemblance to the
    works of Drag City labelmate Will Oldham. In fact, Oldham's <i>Master and Everyone</i> serves as a good
    point of reference for the more whimsical side of this record.  <i>Master and Everyone</i> marked an even
    more pronounced shift away from both the sparse, chilling sound of Oldham's <i>I See a Darkness</i> than
    2001's <i>Ease Down the Road</i>, as well as from Oldham's preferred lyrical themes of sex, death and
    having sex with Death.  As a result, <i>Master and Everyone</i> was prettier, but also more reliant on
    traditional signifiers of ""pretty"" than on Oldham's unique musical vocabulary. Similarly, <i>Supper</i>
    suppresses both Callahan's talent for off-kilter instrumentation and production and his tendency towards
    understated, absurd and darkly comic wordplay in favor of female vocals and clichéd slide guitar.</p><p>
    Still, ""Feather by Feather""-- along with ""Vessel in Vain"", ""Truth Serum"" and ""Our Anniversary""-- stands as
    a fine entry in the Smog oeuvre.  Callahan's Hammond organ, Ken Champion's pedal steel and Sarabeth Tucek's
    breathy backing vocals combine to paint the very same portrait of subdued domesticity that Oldham seemed to
    be working towards on <i>Master and Everyone</i>. Sadly, a close examination of this portrait reveals
    paint-by-numbers outlines faintly detectable behind the color and texture of Callahan's unique baritone.</p><p>
    Though by no means brilliant, the more subdued acoustic tracks on <i>Supper</i> are vastly superior to its
    bland, awkward electric rockers. As the BBC Session recording of ""I Break Horses"" featured in this year's
    singles compilation <i>Accumulation: None</i> clearly demonstrated, Callahan is more than capable of carrying
    off some of his most engaging work with a full band rocking out behind him; the track showed Callahan
    seemingly swept up in the band's energy, his cold voice sounding both heartless and heartbroken. The
    heavier numbers on <i>Supper</i>, however, simply drop Callahan's disaffected voice over displaced Rolling
    Stones-isms. Jim O'Rourke's <i>Insignificance</i> proved that such a formula can yield incredible results
    when executed with wit and finesse, but here, the awkwardness that makes much of Callahan's music so
    heartrending doesn't always work in his favor.</p><p>
    Regardless, <i>Supper</i> is not without strong moments. The album's last tracks, ""Driving"" and ""A Guiding
    Light"", actually break from the disappointingly formulaic sound that Callahan utilizes for the album's
    majority. ""Driving"" turns the record's serene acoustic arrangements into something chaotic, layering plucked
    banjo and sparse, arrhythmic drumming atop occasional flourishes of warm, clean electric guitar. As the song
    progresses, it seems to become both more structured and overwhelming, as its ever-expanding stratum seems to
    congeal into a more regular pattern. ""A Guiding Light"" most closely resembles the Smog of days past, with
    Callahan's chilling voice accompanied only by a haunting, repetitive guitar figure and minimal percussion.
    Unfortunately, even these two relatively strong songs don't hold a candle to the greatest in Smog's back
    catalog.</p><p>
    Throughout his career, Callahan has managed to wear many aesthetic masks while still coming through with
    something unique and interesting.  At his best, he's evoked vivid, complex imagery with a single well-placed
    word or sound.  It would be nice to say that he simply hides behind the machinations of docile country-folk
    and steady riff-rock on <i>Supper</i> to more insidiously convey his distinctively dark musical sense. But
    I get the distinct impression that all of Callahan's cards are on the table here-- where beneath the
    instrumentation there once lied depth and cutting truth, there is now only complacency.</p></div>"|7278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7278-supper/|7.0|Matt LeMay

A layer of germy sediment covers The Waco
    Brothers' image as aging, hard-drinking, boot-sporting journeymen.  Another covers their lyrics, which
    alternate rootin'-tootin' cliches and look-ma-no-fascism politics (think Asleep at the Wheel Against the
    Machine).  Another covers their sound, which is, you know, prairie-punk or saloon-wave or whatever one is
    supposed to call self-consciously country-western iconoclast-pop in 2003. And decades of dust adorn, inches
    deep, the review-twerp complaint that I have to make: This amazing live band can't [sneeze, wipe eyes]
    capture their stage magic [adjust protective paper mask] in the studio.</p><p>
    
    Latecomers to the work of Jon Langford (can I get a show of hands for those familiar with him by way of the
    Palace Brothers' ""For the Mekons et al"" or Sally Timms' cover of ""No More Rides""?) should know that he's a
    Windy City Welshman/liberal self-recast as a scrappy outlaw.  And he ain't afraid to channel Sirs McGowan and
    Bragg to set that image in stone.  The band's pedigree argues for the moniker Cred'N'Crud: they've got two
    Mekons, a Deano who swaps vox with Langford, and then guys from Jesus Jones and KMFDM. Yet, certain blissfully
    raucous moments on this album make one imagine a Clash that kept going, that became semi-competent at
    barn-dance swing, and set off a wave of copycat bands with names like Rodeo Chaos, Harvest Havoc, Sourgum
    Rebellion, Back Porch Culture Jam, and The Lone Star Radicals.</p><p>
    
    I had my crack team of scientistadors do lab experiments to figure out how the Wacos can be so hackneyed,
    yet still worth rooting for on transparent anthems such as ""No Heart"" and ""New Deal Blues"": the results
    were inconclusive. They did, however, prove that ""The Lie"" was better Farrar than Farrar, and that the
    minimal solo on the cover of ""Johnson to Jones"" is right up there with CCR's finest. My army of
    rhetoric-wizards and debate engineers declared that the Wacos think that their Bush-bashing is more
    revolutionary than it is, though they did note that the Wacos could knock a prefab Nashvillian such as
    Toby Keith on his super-seized, truck-pitching, hay-baling butthole. My resident visual artists' coalition
    proposed a sculpture, inspired by the Wacos, of humans trying to mate with jukeboxes, using hammers and
    sickles as contraceptives. My freeloading uncle said that ""AFC Song""'s manic-depressive espousal of defeat
    as a route to victory and destructiveness as a path to creativity was copacetic enough to replace Aerosmith's
    ""Sweet Emotion"" as his afternoon nap-score. My pet Catholic priest pronounced the flat-funk ""Just No Way"" a
    source of shame for all mortalkind.</p><p>
    
    This band is aware that they're pretending, making up the genre of Chicagit-cowcore as they go along; that
    knowledge weirdly gives them a kind of cockiness associated with authenticity. They're keen to their schtick:
    selling a sold notion back to itself. And the idea of linking ""progressive"" rhetoric with a style known for
    clinging resolutely to its roots is kind of genius, like taking a jackhammer to the road to nowhere. S'true,
    the Waco Brothers rock live, all loud and fun and sweaty and unbowed. But the same could be said of Hank III.
    They need to make a record as vibrant as their activist spirit; otherwise this honky-tonk Sex Pistols pattern
    will have people saying they're so at home on the range they've become pretty vacant.</p></div>"|8551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8551-new-deal/|6.0|William Bowers

    rock's consummate pop songwriter freak.  Which, of course, would mean some other wild-eyed kid from Montana
    would have had to be Colin Meloy.  The Real Meloy, in this <i>Trading Places</i>-themed <i>Twilight Zone</i>,
    would have filled in for Mangum's nasal warble and given the world the sweet gift of <i>In the Aeroplane
    Over the Sea</i> with his band Neutral Milk Hotel, while New Guy would front a band named, say, The
    Decemberists, who would shamelessly mine the sparkly folk-fuzz (sans-fuzz) of that most lauded of Elephant
    6 bands.  The Decemberists would be a tad poppier, and maybe a tad sweeter than their key influence, but
    fronted by a voice so close to Mangum's that few could tell the difference.  Some say this may even have
    actually happened.  Some say it's happening right now.</p><p>
    
    Such a mix-up is understandable (even if it may seem quite the opposite on paper): The Decemberists stick
    to the same kind of heavy acoustic folk-rock and freakish lyrical balladry that fueled Neutral Milk Hotel's
    rise to power.  Fortunately, their music also possesses enough unique twists to distinguish it from simple
    mimicry.  The most obvious is the band's often baroque instrumentation, which generally makes for more
    elaborate arrangements than those of their stylistic forbearer.  Hammond organ and subtle theremin flesh
    out the mix, each adding an anachronistic spin on the otherwise quaint jangle of strings and guitars
    hearkening to some dusty, distant past.  Melodic organ riffs, meanwhile, slightly warp the old-time
    illusion of the music-- the better to compliment the absurd, rag-tag world at the center of this band's
    dreamy fictionalizations.</p><p>
    
    The Decemberists' is a land of ghosts and petticoats, ""crooked French-Canadians"" gut-shot while running
    gin, bedwetters and gentlemen suitors, abandoned wastrels and pickpockets.  It's also a realm of bizarre
    historical dreamscapes and snazzy wordplay: ""And just to lie with you/ There's nothing that I wouldn't do/
    Save lay my rifle down,"" sings Meloy in the bittersweet hallucination ""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"".
    Time and again, these unhappy tales and fantastic allegories ring out over strangely soothing, rolling
    folk that seldom breaks from a dense, melancholy haze.</p><p>
    
    Only once does <i>Castaways and Cutouts</i> fully escape the hypnotic pull of its darkling bedtime stories;
    ""July, July!"" may be the album's only genuinely <i>happy</i> moment, decked out in lush harmonies and
    fly-away choruses that clip their wings just shy of soaring towards anything too grand.  And the band
    actually makes this singular elated moment stick by remaining reasonably understated-- despite the
    temptation there must have been to launch into a full-on celebration in the midst of such omnipresent
    malaise, the song is content to simply smile, permeating the surrounding bleakness with a subtle aura of
    peaceful contentment.</p><p>
    
    The constant sobriety of the rest of these tracks does wear thin now and then-- the inclusion of another
    similarly uplifting tune might have made the record somewhat more effective-- but the somber fables of
    <i>Castaways and Cutouts</i> remain compelling nonetheless.  The Decemberists rarely put forth individually
    gripping songs, yet somehow, the result is a remarkable whole, an autonomous unit.  From the opening cry
    of, ""My name is Leslie Anne Levine/ My mother birthed me down a dry ravine,"" to the album's exhausting
    conclusion, the fever never breaks.  So, if Jeff Mangum really is on permanent vacation, we're going to
    need a successor.  Few bands seem as worthy of inheriting his twisted empire as The Decemberists.</p></div>"|2241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2241-castaways-and-cutouts/|8.1|Eric Carr

    reduced.  Having already suffered the indignity of being shrunken from glorious gatefold vinyl to
    pocket-sized jewel case, cover art now faces complete extinction by blank-disc proliferation, no longer
    holding the suggestive power of artfully assembled graphic design.</p><p>
    
    Increasingly taking its place is a
    sort of creative inverse of the former relationship, whereby the music leads the listener to project
    his/her own imagined cover art-- what squiggly doodle will accompany this new lo-fi indie-pop release,
    what moody black-and-white photograph might adorn this shoegazer LP, and so forth.  Playing this game,
    the first minute of Holopaw's self-titled debut almost immediately conjured up images of wood paneling,
    being my default alt-country image response.  When I finally got my criminal hands on a legit copy of
    <i>Holopaw</i>, the wood-paneling spine was third-bear just right, soothing confirmation of my subconscious
    meteorology.</p><p>
    
    But don't be fooled by the standard old-timey exterior, nor by the seemingly straightforward indie-folk
    surface of the songs.  That bold 8+ rating up yonder would not be an acceptable endorsement were the
    five gentlemen of Holopaw as predictable as their album art; rather, their specialty is in the skilled
    peppering of their Tupelo-derived sound with modern and unusual peculiarities.</p><p>
    
    Take that wood-paneling-suggestive opening track, ""Abraham Lincoln"", which starts off like Country Song
    #4623 from shaggy-hairs armed with resale western-style button-downs and a copy of <i>Sweetheart of the
    Rodeo</i>.  Featuring little more than Ugly Casanova collaborator and Holopaw frontman John Orth's
    porch-strummed acoustic and light-twang vocals, the disc prematurely convinces that Holopaw aspire to
    little more than a capsule review towards the back of <i>No Depression</i>.  But by the time the track
    reaches its fully fleshed end, the party's been crashed by jarring synthesizer chirps and a hissy, quiet
    drum machine loop, Nigel Godrich producing Woody Guthrie in a time machine phonebooth.</p><p>
    
    [We briefly interrupt this review for the obligatory timely war reference.  I'm compelled to mention that
    the lyric ""pale green light/ Vibrates across the Abraham Lincoln"" is now forever tied into footage of
    planes taking off from the USS Abraham Lincoln nautical metropolis, which using the beloved ""night-vision""
    lens, takes on a, yep, pale green cast.  Goddamn this infernal war seeping into the peaceful sanctity of
    rock crit!]</p><p>
    
    The rest of Holopaw's almost-too-brief ten tracks are similarly deceptive, roots-rock at heart but with a
    tendency to take sudden turns of arrangement and instrumentation.  <i>Godspell</i>-quotin' ""Igloo Glass"",
    fr'instance, has the quick-stepping pace and mandolin plucks of classic bluegrass, evoking, as such rhythms
    often do, images of steam engines and overalls.  Any tired <i>O Brother</i> references are made moot, however,
    by a brush-trapped drum beat that's repeatedly faded in and out of the mix, and bounced between channels by
    whip-smart producer Brian Deck.</p><p>
    
    With Southern music trapped too often within strict constructs of genre definition and Golden Age fetishism,
    Holopaw defiantly eschew Ludditism to great effect.  ""Hoover"" and ""Cinders"" each ride on a warm Rhodes buzz,
    the latter adding a jalopy horn section full of dissonant clash; the impeccably structured and moving ""Teacup
    Woozy"" benefits from a low keyboard rumble beneath its classic folktale of travel and woe.  And yet no song
    is so weighted down with studio trickery that the band loses its Everglades identity, anchored as they are
    by Orth's unfaked swamp warble and lyrical lyrics (tellingly organized as prose in the liners).</p><p>
    
    By now you're probably just begging for a comparison to those other recent country-educated embracers of
    technology, Wilco, and public servant that I am, I'll oblige.  If <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> becomes the
    figurehead of a genre offshoot, Holopaw would certainly make the appropriate Tower Records listening booth,
    Americonica that it is.  But Holopaw most embodies the rather exciting state of roots-rock/alt-country/bumpkin
    indie, which has finally gotten over the fear of ruining ""authenticity"" by using modern tools.  Holopaw's
    cover art and Depression-era script logo might be indie-folk standard issue, but the music contained within
    is a refreshing, effective new use of the boundaries: a wood-paneled Powerbook.</p></div>"|3908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3908-holopaw/|8.2|Rob Mitchum

    For those of you new to this whole ""Internet"" thing, a googler is a desk jockey who's become so adept at
    finding idiosyncratic (and sometimes even relevant) things on the Net's finest search engine that they
    actually warrant a title.  In a broader sense, I suppose we're all Googlers when we use the search engine,
    but the term is best applied to the true masters-- and arguably, a sort of backhanded compliment.</p><p>
<i>Googler</i> is the second album from the Louisville, Kentucky-based Parlour, headed up by Tim Furnish
    (Crain, Cerebellum, Aerial M).  I suppose the fact that there's an album titled after this Information Age
    piece of verbiage means the term is here to stay, at least until the site it got its name from is superceded
    by something better.  But what to make of the cover art?  In case you're straining into the GIF at the top
    of the page, that's a big cloud of googly eyes on a yellow background adorning the cover.  The CD itself
    is decorated with a massive googly eye, and they dominate all of the other artwork as well.  I can only
    imagine the possibilities for a vinyl release-- you <i>know</i> those things would be real, functioning
    googly eyes if this were an LP.  Bottom line: what a fucking terrible pun.</p><p>
    
    Parlour's quota for humor (or perhaps humour) seems to be filled by album titles and artwork, though, as
    this and their debut, <i>Octopus Off Broadway</i>, attest.  That record was bursting with texture, but
    completely undernourished melodically, and as such, was pleasant but not very fulfilling.  This new album
    signals a different sound and direction for the band, rearranging all the elements, and entirely for the
    better.  They still couldn't find a melody if they were living next door to it, but the textures that were
    so obviously their forte on the debut are infinitely more engrossing and varied here.</p><p>
    
    What's odd about this is that these songs were all recorded over a period of several years beginning in
    1997-- the same period of recording that yielded <i>Octopus Off Broadway</i>-- indicating that the band was
    more fully formed in their early days than that record let on.  <i>Googler</i> sounds like a genuine
    progression, but if it's actually concurrent with their other material, it makes you wonder where this band
    might be headed-- an open question for the moment, it seems. </p><p>
    
    Things get off to a somewhat familiar start with ""Jololinine"", which nods to previous Parlour material with
    its slow build and heavy layering of buzzing organs, electronic programming and clean guitars, but all bets
    are off when ""Distractor"" kicks in with its twitchy drums and splattered, dissonant guitar chords.  The
    shifts in tension, weird rubbery breakdown and action/reaction structure are more than enough to make up
    for the lack of melodic focus, and the song stands as the best thing Parlour have put their name on yet.
    ""Over the Under"" is almost as good, riding a groove built to last and building slowly to a wah-soaked
    climax that toes a strange line between math and funk.</p><p>
    
    ""Regulkfro Reel"" acts as a turning point for the album, transforming at its midpoint from a wildly askew
    stack of riffs and drums to a series of ambient washes that pulse like Stars of the Lid.  The band places
    little quasi-melodic keyboard flourishes in the glow on an almost subliminal level, setting you up for the
    echoing chamber of keys and rounded-off sounds that comprises ""Hop Pife"".  ""Hop Pife"" conjures a space
    filled with fluid, like a womb, but not quite as warm or safe, as strange quarter-tone synths enter like
    slow motion sirens near the halfway point.  ""Svrendikditement"" closes things out with a foot on the
    post-rock and another wandering the world of static-fringed glitch, building on a basic, programmed tribal
    rhythm and some marimba-ish timbres, and winding up with a crunchy, noise-tainted concoction brimming with
    brain-grabbing sounds.</p><p>
    
    Strange, then, that this was recorded at the same time as Parlour's debut-- because it sounds nothing like
    the other record, instead coming across as a leap and a bound forward toward something entirely more
    interesting and bracing.  Parlour still aren't grabbing me with melody the way I want them to, but maybe
    that's just not the point for them.  And anyway, with <i>Googler</i>, they've proven that they can be
    genuinely engaging without much assistance from melody, which is impressive enough in itself.</p></div>"|6177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6177-googler/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    trip-hop ghost was a surefire formula for post-pinnacle glory? Whatever memo found its way into Cypress Hill
    DJ Muggs' drug drawer must surely deserve the blame for <i>Dust</i>, a technically competent but lacking
    attempt to expand the producer's repertoire beyond the dusty, wet-smoking rhythmic foundations he laid down
    on early Cypress albums, using the nu-metal crossover of their 2000 disc, <i>Skull and Bones</i>, as the
    point of disembarking. You won't hear anything that draws from the gloomy barrio beats of <i>Temples of
    Doom</i> or <i>Black Sunday</i>, and the dearth of MCs guarantees no lyrical meditations to rival ""How Could
    I Just Kill a Man""; even ""Dr. Greenthumb"" rises above.</p><p>
    With the exception of Everlast, who contributes his Kentucky moonshiner exhalations to the boring, heart-broken
    sob-story ""Gone for Good"", the majority of the vocal contributions here are made by female singers, chanteuses
    who at all times strain to approximate the performances of trip-hop notables like Beth Gibbons, Björk, Tracey
    Thorn, and anyone else who sounds impressively sultry, strung out and seductive. That seems to be the order
    of the day for Muggs; the cranky wall-of-noise ""Dead Flowers"", the blatant ""Angel"" ripoff ""I Know"", and
    ""Tears"" are as contrived and forgettable as their titles suggest, and equally interchangeable.</p><p>
<i>Juxtapose</i>, Muggs' loose collaboration with Tricky, seems to have rubbed off and drifted to the surface,
    but Muggs can't quite pin it down.  So instead, it flies all over the room, shitting everywhere and squawking
    rabidly, and we're left with some weak Britpop hybrids (with the embarrassingly saccharine ""Rain"" at the top of
    the list) and some token snippets of studio tomfoolery, ranging from the almost-clever Laswell IDM of ""Shadows""
    to the, um, almost-clever ambient music of ""Niente"". I pity the fool who has to clean this up. It's an
    unrefined, poorly calculated mess.</p><p>
    I know everything reads to the contrary, but I'm not doubting DJ Muggs. Really. You can't fuck with the
    aforementioned Cypress records; shit, even the Muggs-produced ""Babalu Bad Boy"" rocked the house harder than
    anything on <i>Dust</i> ten years prior. Would it help to know that on the CD I'm looking at, it boasts:</p><p>
    ""A down-tempo rock masterpiece by Cypress Hill's legendary producer""?</p><p>
    No, I'm not doubting DJ Muggs. I'm doubting the quality of a song like ""Morta"", with its jack-in-the-box
    flamenco bombast struggling to impersonate Björk's ""I Play Dead"", which isn't that good to begin with anyway.
    I'm questioning any excuse you can think of for the trite, nasally ""Faded"": ""We are, we are, we are, we are
    always faded/ You are, you are, you are the one in my pages...""?  What is the excuse for that bullshit?
    Get this out of my house.</p></div>"|5497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5497-dust/|1.1|Mark Martelli

As always, the Canadian DJ looks like a doll: made-up and
    over-styled, otherworldly, and proud as ever of his unnaturally slim hips. But-- as always-- he also looks like he doesn't belong there;
    like the worst yearbook portraits, the person in the picture seems slightly out-of-place, stiff and uncomfortable in someone else's
    clothes. Just imagine his hand under his chin in a ""thoughtful"" pose, knowing there's a devastating pimple smeared over with foundation.</p><p>
    
    The boudoir pictured here belongs the Tiga of champagne-or-cocaine European electro, the Tiga who wrapped up a
    trend's worth of International Deejay Gigolos singles with his <i>American Gigolo</i> mix and gave them a public face with his half-assed
    smash-hit cover of ""Sunglasses at Night."" But trends-- especially the type you can dance to-- are built to mutate, and the sound of
    those Miss Kittin and Vitalic singles is already a bit, as they say, last year.</p><p>
    
    But that's only the portrait. The good news for us is that the boudoir and wardrobe are, and have always been, rentals: Tiga
    was delivering the well-groomed tech-house well before electro started clashing, and now-- as the rigid swirl of that first thrilling
    pop wave spirals off in a dozen directions-- he shows up to each party in different suits. Admittedly, his novelty-tie cover of
    Nelly's ""Hot in Herre"" was probably more fun for him than it was for us, but on this contribution to the <i>DJ Kicks</i> mix series, he's
    not only resplendent, he's at home, digging well beyond the obvious to give us a mix that's both refreshing and all Tiga. The brief
    detour through Gigolo grind has brought him back to his best pair of cigarette-leg jeans: a drippy, soulful, and surprisingly
    light-touch party mix of vividly housey electro, the usual grainy fog suddenly broken by bright lights and the lingering smiles
    of Soft Cell, ABC, maybe even Cameo.</p><p>
    
    It's only five minutes in, for instance, when Playgroup's instrumental mix of Chromeo's ""You're So Gangsta"" gives you the good-time
    vapors with-- praise heaven-- a saxophone solo, closing its eyes and dancing rapturously over the teched-up echo of a funk guitar lick.
    The next few tracks trade techno grids with disco bass grooves and squeaky clavi-funk, shaking and chuckling their way up to a
    necessary high point: DFA's hand-clapping remix of Le Tigre's ""Deceptacon"" struts happily along like Stevie Wonder with
    riot-grrl cheerleading. The whole first half of this mix is a flat-out good time: it's like watching a hipster's scowl gradually
    crumble.  There's still the deep, rich pulse of the whole new-electro project, but it's as if someone's put on a pink headband and
    switched on the lights, letting loose the playful groove and pastel-colored electric funk too many people have carefully expunged
    from their 80s memories.</p><p>
    
    And then starts something possibly better. ""Deceptacon"" slides seamlessly into Soft Cell's magnificent ""...So"", where synth piano
    and chimes keep up the disco, even as the gauzy swells draw you deeper into dark. By the time Codec &amp; Flexor's ""Time Has Changed""
    comes around, the depths have found their soul: the whirring tech beat continues, but the synth pulse drops away to an airy hum and
    a set of rich, earnest vocals, a ballad with its trenchcoat collar turned suavely up. Two tracks later comes a surprise to beat that first
    saxophone: Red Zone's remix of Stevie V.'s ""Dirty Cash"", wherein a vocal hook (that always sat in Soul II Soul's shadow) bursts through
    like its explicit aim was always to make Germanic electro monotony look weak. The cuts here slip darker and throb more relentlessly,
    but they still find way more of the ""disco"" in Italo-disco.</p><p>
    
    So begins the end, wherein Tiga skirts close around the old electro mode and brings us to another remix highlight, this time the
    fabulous electric pop of Martini Bros., as handled by Black Strobe.  ""The Biggest Fan""-- like the pop-ready chug of TokTok vs. Soffy
    O-- is a soft, sunny speeder that could theoretically command a radio like the days of old. From there it's a quick slide into another
    one of those Tiga covers that seems to be saying more than it should possibly be able to-- this time a New Romanticized remaking of
    Felix da Housecat's genre-defining ""Madame Hollywood"", Miss Kittin's provocative chant replaced with Tiga himself, crooning like a
    world-weary Simon LeBon.</p><p>
    
    There's a second metaphor here. Perched up on these two singles-- ""The Biggest Fan"" with its happy ode to narcissism, and ""Mister
    Hollywood"" with its newly-soulful pop stride-- the whole project seems to have been reframed: suddenly it's become more human, more
    pop, more relaxed, and a dozen times more fun. Half of the excitement right now-- as people start wandering away from the main stage
    of the 2001 electro sound-- lies in watching all of the different directions they wander. The corner Tiga's returned to is terrific;
    what's even better is the vague sense that he could just as easily choose to wander elsewhere, and wind up making you change
    your mind about the whole thing all over again.</p></div>"|8056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8056-dj-kicks/|8.2|Nitsuh Abebe

    This mantra, counting to twelve in Japanese, begins to resemble the cyclic
    routine of someone suffering from OCD after awhile. It's actually very easy
    to say, and even if it sounds like gibberish to other people, all the better
    to spin your own mental wheels.  Repeat it and start over, and try to see how
    many times you can do this without missing a number or making a mistake.  If
    you do, start over again.  Try to do all of this in a steady rhythm, and with
    a couple of friends, make a chorus of counting.  Then, try to start at the
    same time but all in different tempos-- keep your own rhythm while the others
    go off on their own, and then all meet up again on ""ichi.""  If you mess up,
    start over again.  And again.  Then, once more.</p><p>
    
    In music, the only culture I know of that employs such complex counting
    exercises in their traditional music is from India.  Philip Glass spoke of
    studying Indian music before creating his equally mathematical minimalist
    pieces of the early 70s.  Terry Riley also studied Indian classical music,
    as did La Monte Young.  These composers are united by an interest in the
    disciplined refinement of Indian music, and all applied it to their own
    idiosyncratic music.  Likewise, Asa-Chang &amp; Junray reference Indian music
    in the process of creating music that is otherwise quite unique.  In their
    case, the idea of rhythm and meter, and the extended development of beat
    exercises disguised as melodies, seems related to Indian raga.  On ""Xylophone"",
    they even bring in sitars to compliment the already dominant tabla and bongo.</p><p>
    
    The mini-album <i>Tsu Gi Ne Pu</i> (named for an old Japanese poem) is the
    fourth release by this duo, and even more than last year's compilation
    <i>Jun Ray Song Chang</i>, emphasizes how rhythm dominates their music.
    This almost maddening focus on rhythm dominates every tune on the record,
    even when, on the surface, it appears that they took a simpler, more
    song-oriented approach.</p><p>
    
    On ""Kaikyo"", trumpet and trombone played with
    subtle apprehension perform a tune that reminds me of the closing credits
    to a an old Spaghetti Western.  However, the actual melody is less brassy
    fanfare than merely the vocalization of what would otherwise be a drum part,
    right down to the accented, triplet figures and unison doubling of Asa-Chang's
    percussion.  As it unfolds, the duo plays more aggressively, picks up some
    speed, and builds upon the simple figures they began with, until they arrive
    at a one-note endgame.  They've gone through every conceivable combination
    of beats, and end the tune on a sampled crashing of waves.  The song is the
    perfect depiction of obsessive mathematical development (or feverish logic),
    and will probably annoy as many people as it entertains.</p><p>
    
    ""Kutsu #3"" begins innocently enough with a trumpet and accordion duet,
    neither of which are playing in any particular rhythm.  After their short
    statement, and a few rising sine tones carried over from the previous album,
    everything disappears.  For better than 10 minutes, there are no sounds at
    all, until a female narrator begins the countdown reference the opened this
    review.  She counts to twelve, each number representing one note in a chromatic
    scale, and Asa-Chang and U-Zhaan join in.  The never sing the same numbers at
    the same time, except when meeting up on the first one, instead each enunciating
    a different pattern with clockwork perfection.  For anyone into polyrhythmic
    fugue, this will doubtlessly be fascinating-- though like most of Asa-Chang
    and Junray's music, it could have an equally maddening effect on others.</p><p>
    
    I'm a little confused as to why the band needed to put that extended moment
    of silence in there (especially as it takes up about a fourth of the already
    brief album's run-time), but if a little goes a long way, these two are
    masters of exotic minimalism.  It's going to be interesting to see where
    they go next; <i>Tsu Gi Ne Pu</i> gives me the feeling it might very well be
    into uncharted (and impenetrable) rhythmic waters.  Like Glass and Riley,
    they've managed to strike a balance between the obsessive and the charming,
    and it's still a pretty interesting, if occasionally detached sound.</p></div>"|306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/306-tsu-gi-ne-pu/|7.0|Dominique Leone

    churning out one chocolate-frosted cereal box prize after another and bringing down the house with an
    inspired mix of rubbery funk, hipster soul and gleefully contorted, krush groovin' hip-hop. Mr. Scruff's
    inner pre-school party animal is in full effect, flexing a little four-on-the-floor muscle, and while
    this album may not be a huge leap from his debut LP, <i>Keep It Unreal</i> (his love of rusty samples and
    chunky, plastic drums still dominates), he's managed to take his distinct sound in a few new directions.</p><p>
    
    More than a few props are in order for some other members of the Ninja Tune clan, whose influences are clear
    on many of the tracks: the third-world swing of Up, Bustle and Out is borrowed for the chaingang saxophone
    boogie of ""Shelf Wobbler"", as well as the Snorks-in-a-keyboard-shop lounge of ""Shrimp"", and recent
    vocal-heavy singles from Cinematic Orchestra and The Herbaliser appear to be the impetus for ""Beyond"",
    ""Valley of the Sausages"" and ""Come Alive"", featuring singers Seaming and Niko, respectively.</p><p>
    
    ""Come Alive"" is enhanced by Niko's warm, breezy delivery, a wah-wah bassline made of Jell-O and ragged string samples
    transformed into sultry speak-easy jazz by her voice, but Seaming's cuts are two of the few missteps on
    the record: a fairly ambiguous Curtis Mayfield potboiler, ""Beyond"" lacks the inventiveness of <i>Trouser
    Jazz</i>'s more memorable moments, and ""Valley of the Sausages"" runs in circles around its sweaty Cuban
    percussion.  With a label as tight-knit as Ninja Tune, this kind of cross-pollination is inevitable. Scruff
    is able to take these borrowed elements and make them function in his own ramshackle funhouse.  Their spirit
    is especially evident in the rhythm section, which remains rambunctious and spirited for the whole of the
    album.</p><p>
    
    Too often, though, fun means frivolousness, an excuse for simplicity and sloppiness that, while rarely
    detracting seriously from the proceedings, leaves the album without any semblance of ingenuity or progression.
    For Mr. Scruff, playtime is serious shit. One listen to the fingerpaint jitterbug ""Come On Grandad"", which
    revolves around soapy synth bursts and a funky bandleader egging things on, is enough to send anyone running
    out to the playground.  ""Ug"", previously released on Ninja Tune's <i>Xen Cuts</i> box set, and as a B-side
    to the Volkswagen-approved  ""Get a Move On"", is above all else a giant teddy bear of a track, a toy box of
    basic, blocky bits and pieces that fuse into a towering wad of crunk'd up scrap metal; the subcutaneous
    bellow of the bassline, the Flat Eric keyboard squawks and slithering hi-hat snaps propel ""Ug"" to the top
    of the heap.</p><p>
    
    Scruff even works a little two-step flava into ""Giffin"", turning a fairly sedate, atmospheric
    instrumental into a smooth operator with a bit of a pulse. And while it's not nearly as ideal a collaboration
    as ""Jus Jus"" (a two-minute head-bobber featuring Roots Manuva on the mic), the Neptunes-in-daycare b-boy
    swagger of ""Vibrate"" satisfies, laced with highly contagious call-and-response couplets and the relaxed
    ramblings of Leeds-based MC Braintax, yet another British lyricist who is in actuality much more talented
    than that bony pipsqueak in The Streets.</p><p>
    
    The hip-hop element is fully exposed on ""Vibrate"", but it's the rhythmic foundation of the majority of
    <i>Trouser Jazz</i>-- coupled at various times with an assortment of roots music, from back-alley soul to
    Technicolor funk, equal parts Funki Porcini and Fat Albert-- that makes it an entertaining listen.  Scruff
    keeps things sticky and sweet, passing out peanut-butter-and-fluff sandwiches and chocolate milk by the
    trunk-full, keeping things on a positive tip.  <i>Trouser Jazz</i> is music for picnics and campouts: sly
    and soulful, and not at all concerned with the Monday to come.</p></div>"|5477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5477-trouser-jazz/|7.0|Mark Martelli

    usually hang this uniqueness on. Language holds us together: the ability to communicate with abstract symbols
    is universal among cultures and innate to all individuals exposed to it. And language has set us apart,
    leading to all the advances-- agriculture, industry, social organization-- that have allowed us to dominate
    other vertebrates, including other humans. It's clear what language is good for, if not exactly how it works.</p><p>
    
    If you think about it, music is just as universal and unique. But is it adaptive? Darwin thought it was an
    elaborate mating call. Others have claimed it's more like ritual cement, good for aligning people with each
    other. Of course, it might just be a way to let our auditory minds blow off a little steam from the usual
    verbal grind. And then there's evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker, who has suggested that music is
    ""cultural cheesecake,"" serving no adaptive function at all. Music may not be adaptive, but music does adapt,
    so maybe we should be asking about the evolution of music itself, about the way we play host to a variety of
    competing sound memes.</p><p>
    
    Which is all to say: Ask not what you require of the music; but what the music requires of you. That's the
    right attitude to have when you enter <i>Mani</i>, the debut release from Dorine Muraille. Having previously
    recorded an artefact under the name Gel, French composer Julien Locquet is no stranger to what some are
    calling laptop-folk. The sounds he brings to <i>Mani</i> are from demure and folky sources-- a muted piano,
    a children's song, a ukulele-- but they're so finely chopped up and swirled around that the project comes
    off as a series of thought experiments in fluid dynamics. It might help to cling to the voice of poetess
    Chloe Delaume, whose abstract work is featured prominently. But better would be to let the debris wash right
    through you as it gets ripped up, scattered, drenched, fed into itself, rinsed, squeezed, and sometimes laid
    out to dry.</p><p>
    
    The anti-authoritarian bathroom scrawl on the back of the album may have been trying to warn me. But <i>Mani</i>
    doesn't want me to keep approaching music the way I know how, as hooks and verses, loops and layers, or even
    beginnings, middles and ends.  Rather, I think part of <i>Mani</i> wants me to be a machine, and part of it
    wants me to be an animal. Let me explain. The opening track, ""Le Supplice de la Bagnoire"", is wildly soothing
    given how little there is to latch onto. A needle drag, a simple piano figure, some vinyl dust, snatches of
    guitar and female voice-- that's it, and the rest is just these moments blowing around in the white-tiled
    vacuum of an antique restroom, then getting worked into your scalp like a therapeutic shampoo. The expressive
    result is somewhere between a lullaby and an emergency eyewash. It's stunning, in an inhuman way.</p><p>
    
    Then ""Bbraallen"" starts up with a chaotic ukulele and a real live beat, but soon degenerates into an awkward
    freeform accompaniment to some god-awful field recording of the tired old ballad ""Barbara Allen"". If the
    title is an indication that Muraille is trying to bring out a minimal doubleness in this song, then surely
    he has failed. The next track butchers a French nursery rhyme in much the same way. But then a track uses
    song in just the <i>right</i> way, letting it get swallowed up in a grainy storm of tactus-jamming ticks
    and blaring digital clip, having an expressive effect somewhere between raw predation and hard-drive failure.
    The gentle piano improvisations that fill out the back end of the album are interrupted by something that
    sounds like a cross between a campfire and a water filtration plant. And then a vibraphone trio warms up,
    only to be drenched in sweet acid rain through an open roof.</p><p>
    
    If music were like most other forms of animal behavior, it would have to have come about gradually as the
    result of a series of adaptations. But is it possible that the capacity for music, like language, is a
    result of the lucky misuse of hardware evolved for other purposes? And if so, do we now have other latent
    capacities just waiting to be misused in precisely the right ways? If enough people listen to stuff like
    <i>Mani</i>, we may soon find out.</p></div>"|5507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5507-mani/|8.7|Jascha Hoffman

    to revise the psychedelic era into something less embarrassing than it actually was. If it weren't for
    things like the Woodstock documentary, young pups only now becoming acquainted with the period might be
    led to believe that hippies actually had some substance to them rather than simply having substances in
    them. One of the most ruthlessly expunged figures from the time was one Donovan Leitch, that poor, trusting
    sap who bought into all the promises flying around the mid-to-late-60s with myopic conviction. Through his
    music, he spread the gospel to blissed-out followers only to find that he had chained himself to a sinking
    social and musical movement. When he went down with the ship, more than a few music-lovers were happy enough
    to be spared the reminder of what they formerly thought were the easy answers to life's most difficult
    questions.</p><p>
    
    If he can be forgiven for his naivete (and he can), then Donovan deserves a much kinder evaluation than he
    usually gets. The sunny folks at Darla Records seem to have thought so, too, and rather than simply carping
    about it, they went out and assembled a tribute record to a man few would seem brave enough to publicly
    salute. A total of eighteen groups queue up on <i>A Gift from a Garden to a Flower</i>, drawing out the
    elements that made Donovan so enjoyable, as well as some of the ones that made him silly. As Bob Dylan
    can tell you, it's easy to poke fun at Donovan-- so much so that many of the artists on <i>Gift</i> do it
    while attempting to do the exact opposite.</p><p>
    
    The torch of Donovan's excessive seriousness is regrettably carried
    on by The Blood Group and Pale Horse and Rider, smudging ""Colours"" and ""There Is an Ocean"", respectively.
    Self-indulgence is also on display, with track after track showing to varying degrees the crimes against
    good taste so easily committed by the chemically impaired. Worst of all are the ones whose self-consciousness
    leads them to douse their entries with heaps of irony. Ciao Bella's murder of ""Mellow Yellow"" is absolutely
    egregious-- if they were so uncomfortable affirming Donovan's talents, perhaps they should have sat this one
    out.</p><p>
    
    The ease with which Donovan can be transmogrified into a walking joke tends to overshadow the fact that he
    was an able songwriter, and that, with the aid of producer Mickie Most, he was able to contribute some
    delightful moments to the rock canon. Though no one takes a shot at his only #1, the Jimmy Page-enhanced
    ""Sunshine Superman"", there are enough other highlights to make up for it. Rising stars Pas/Cal pitch in
    with ""Oh Gosh"", Lenola trips out ""Atlantis"" to the breaking point, and the estimable My Morning Jacket
    gives ""Wear Your Love Like Heaven"" a fun technological dressing-up that respects the spirit of the original.
    But the jewel of the bunch, surprisingly, is Watoo Watoo's run-through of ""Jennifer Juniper"", a brilliant
    recasting of baroque pop as skittering, low-key electronica. They and the other standout performers prove
    that Donovan's unapologetic optimism sewed seeds that far outlived his epoch, and in the process, show that
    that's not such a bad thing after all.</p></div>"|2424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2424-a-gift-from-a-garden-to-a-flower-a-tribute-to-donovan/|5.7|Brian James

The press around her last
    album, <i>Sunny Border Blue</i>, honed in on a few lines that made unusually (for her) naked admissions
    about troubles in her life-- her custody battle over her eldest son, or the break-up of the Throwing Muses--
    wrapped up as conveniently as when John Lennon first sang, ""I don't believe in Beatles.""  It's easy to write
    a story around these clear-cut revelations, but reading the words denies you the chance to hear her tell
    it herself, which is far more powerful.</p><p>
<i>The Grotto</i> doesn't even come with a lyric sheet, or anything else that could shortcut Hersh's
    enthralling delivery on one of the starkest albums she's ever recorded.  <i>Sunny Border Blue</i> was
    solid, but it was also easy-going, with even the toughest lyrics set in tuneful pop.  This time, she's
    changed course to release two of her most extreme discs: the startling Throwing Muses reunion, which in
    New England parlance is ""wicked loud,"" and its complement, this quietly blinking acoustic album.</p><p>
    
    Her voice, raspy and harsh against the gently ringing acoustic guitar, makes you expect a gloomy, even
    maudlin disc.  But that can distract from what makes it great: its ambiguity, the way she expresses herself
    in such strangely personal terms yet never settles on an emotional tone.  She weaves domestic themes
    (family, love and marriage, alcohol, child-rearing) into pieces that come out so fully formed it's almost
    easier to take them individually than as an album.  Yet as careful as they sound, they don't reach many
    answers.  She reportedly joked to her husband, ""These songs seem to be about how I can't leave you,"" and
    that would be a pretty concise explanation-- but anybody who's been married knows there are hundreds of
    ways to stay together.</p><p>
    
    Her words drop like lead weights.  Take the opening statement of the captivating ""SRB"": ""Headfirst into the
    headboard/ I'm shatterproof.""  Or the album's first song, ""Sno Cat"", which is a scattering of images and
    scenes from a marriage.  Other songs are more impressionistic, though never as abstract as, say, the
    strangest stuff on <i>Hips and Makers</i>; her voice can rise from a rough, direct tone, to the guttural
    wails that trail across ""Vitamins V"", and then to a pace that's almost hypnotically introverted-- like
    ""Ether"", which lilts in circles at a slow, methodical pace.  And that's not to say that every track is
    so serious, but not even the lighter ones sound casual: there's a heavy silence between these notes.</p><p>
    
    While the words may be the focus, the music is tuneful and perfectly rendered.  There are beautiful moments
    throughout the album, like the guitar bridge of ""SRB"", the twinkling piano that opens ""Vanishing Twin"", or
    the whistling ghost town ambience of ""Silver Sun"".  Hersh has two strong accompanists, Giant Sand's Howe
    Gelb on piano and the inimitable violinist Andrew Bird.  Gelb's playing is restrained, sometimes limited
    itself to a few notes at the end of a song or a quiet backing line that adds just enough sentimentality;
    likewise Bird, judiciously used on just a few tracks, has a perfectly yearning tone, sad without melodrama.
    Gelb and Bird have toured with Hersh, and even though they stay respectfully out of the spotlight you can
    hear their camaraderie-- on ""Arnica Montana"", a carefree tune that actually rollicks; or when they end the
    album together on ""Ether"", Hersh wrapping them into her stark, introverted narrative.</p><p>
    
    The transitions from joy to isolation make clear how much ground Hersh has staked out here: even she may
    not understand all the feelings laid out in these songs.  The most striking sections don't describe deep
    crises or dramas, but spread across day-to-day life; the outcome is neither content nor bittersweet.
    Instead, like most of her best work, it's stuck on the emotions she can't decipher.</p></div>"|3843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3843-the-grotto/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

With his continuing commitment to a war only a third of his citizens
    support, Blair's political future, and even his job, has been called into question.  Whether he started
    out as a UN-minded liberal or a militant interventionist, his credibility from here is in serious disrepair.
    As poodle in the lap of a unilateral and pre-emptive Texan, he must have some doubts about which side of
    ""with us or against us"" he really wanted to be on. And if they're pumping music into the doghouse, you can
    bet he's rocking himself to sleep to the freeform aural assaults of Lewis Parker.</p><p>
    
    It seems like hip-hop is not yet as thoroughly market-driven and overexposed in Britain as it has been in
    the U.S. for quite some time, so there aren't many alternatives to doing it for the love over there.  Lewis
    Parker is no exception.  In 1998 he earned a lasting place in the Brit-hop pantheon with his dark, autumnal
    <i>Masquerades and Silhouettes</i> album, but then dropped off the face of the island-- silent but for a
    few compilation appearances and collaborations.  Friendlier than a Braintax, but far more serious than The
    Aspects, Lewis Parker can battle with a neutral mask, but seems to draw on an undercurrent of well-considered
    rage. In contrast to Massive Attack, whose Melankolic label has released this new album, Parker seems to
    be comfortable taking the time to exact genius from himself. As one British reviewer put it, ""Although heads
    have run out of saliva waiting for it, there is more than enough [material] here to get them moist again.""</p><p>
    
    If <i>It's All Happening Now</i> is any indication, Lewis has, these past five years, been chilling in his
    bedroom with the sequencer going and freestyling about his day. His blunt, precise sense of rhythm and
    natural rhymes glue together what might seem like somewhat loose themes on the lips of a less confident
    rapper. The minimal song structures, with just enough hook to pull themselves out of the frame for another
    impulsive verse, make for a sequence of tight three-minute tracks that can seem almost endless. With
    drop-ins by a dizzying array of pouting UK emcees, it feels like one marathon South London basement session.
    Guests include Apollo, Jhest and Supa T, who with Parker make up the Cloudsteppers Federation, formerly
    Champions of Nature. Says member Dolo: ""The story behind the Champions of Nature is that we were all in a
    freakshow... but we escaped after realizing that music was the only way to go forward."" Someone has since
    offered them jobs as knife-throwers' assistants.</p><p>
    
    As relentless as the lyrics are, this album would be nothing without the straight-laced beats that drive
    every single track deep into its own future, like the best early Atmosphere did.  Although the lack of
    production credits makes me nervous about leaving someone out, it's safe to say that Lewis Parker delivers
    the whole beats-and-rhymes package all of a piece-- there's only one sensibility at work here. On ""Mum's
    the Word"", Parker's homage to crate-digging, guitar octaves bloom in the grainy middle distance, like oily
    pastels on delivery paper.  On a few tracks, unnatural brass and string crescendos push and pull at the waist
    of whoever's got the mike at the moment. Shit, even the thirty-second interludes leave me panting. The
    kicks are always electrically present, acting more like a catalyst than a foundation for the rhythmic
    superstructure.  And then there are the snares: vine-ripened in Sicily, drugged and bludgeoned in Manchester,
    marinated in Marseilles, and served raw in a pool of their own expansion in the comfort of your very own head.
    In the words of that same wise British reviewer, ""They are lovely and crusty, there is nothing wrong with
    that.""</p><p>
    
    After my first few listens to <i>It's All Happening Now</i>, I found myself ignoring the lyrics and wanting
    to live inside the beats. But I'm not pining for the instrumental version. Lewis Parker's lyrics are like a
    sandblast giving a smooth polish to the sweet jaggedness below.  Or just noise on the surface of a single
    vivid walking meditation.</p></div>"|6170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6170-its-all-happening-now/|8.5|Jascha Hoffman

Though I've never been there, I associate the labor-conquers-all state with
    ridiculously wide expanses of blue that at times seem oppressive in their beauty. I can only assume these atmospheric conditions,
    though: I've not been to Oklahoma, only its neighbor Kansas, and that state is endless from one side to the other. I was on one
    road during my entire drive through the state, but as I looked left and right I wasn't sure if I should
    laugh or let myself fall apart at the site of so much repetition made real.</p><p>
    
    So in the spirit of full disclosure, you should know now that I wrote this review with a sleeveless promotional CD and had no idea
    that the cover art for <i>Infinite Keys</i> is in fact a photograph of a blue sky over a green field. I only saw that afterward. And
    though it does make me want to trust my instincts-- maybe go into graphic design as a second career?-- it had no bearing on the
    review as written. Onward:</p><p>
    
    Ester Drang are a five-piece from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and seem to be writing music based on cloud
    formations. I imagine them waiting patiently for a patch of white to explode, for a break in the otherwise steady weather, allowing
    them a chance to experiment with dynamics in response. Since 1995 they've put out a single, a now out-of-print EP, and last-year's
    somewhat lauded LP <i>Goldenwest</i> on Burnt Toast. With each release they've been charting a pretty straight path toward <i>Infinite
    Keys</i>, their first full-length for Jade Tree. And here, in the present, the preordained Ester-Drang cosmology doesn't shake much.</p><p>
    
    From the first to the final fade, the music is a whisper. Each piece washes in dusty sheets, as though the band is literally assigning
    particular notes and durations to patterns in the sky. If that were the case, it could end up as a form of environmental music like
    the work of Chicago sound artist Collin Olan who, for example, inserted two contact microphones into a block of ice, submerged the
    block in water, and recorded the sounds it made as it melted.  I like that-- I like theory-- but I can't invent intentions for Ester
    Drang and, ultimately, they don't seem to have such lofty or eccentric goals. I think, really, they really just kind of dig Radiohead.
    Or a section Radiohead as re-interpreated by The Gloria Record.  Here and there, I've read comparisons to The
    Flaming Lips, and I don't get it. Though they share the same home state, and in the past collaborated with Steven
    Drozd on a single, the folks pushing Ester Drang as participants in some kind of Oklahoma-grown sound are stretching things
    to fill an easily processed critical canvas.</p><p>
    
    ""One Hundred Times"" is where they're most openly taking from Radiohead; it's also when the stock elements of their wistfulness gel temporarily.
    The vocal lines cascade and plummet, little bleeps and buzzes make sense in relation to the overall density of the music, and, more
    importantly, there are enough pauses, build-ups, sputters, and redirections to make you feel like you're flying somewhere, leaping over your
    mundane town in a single bound.  ""Oceans of You"" is the indie-rock version of Coldplay, shouting gracefully about ""problems"" fading. Incandescent
    shit-- I can imagine them performing this with an orchestra at the Grammys: lights flicker, the orchestra blows a fuse (some dude passes out
    in row one!), and as I watch from my living room floor I wonder if I'm supposed to feel something. The music is pretty-- it's difficult to deny that--
    but so are the sounds of cars driving by your house at 4AM, or how the world muffles a bit when you put your ear up to a puddle.</p><p>
    
    When your music is light and airy, you need to make sure it's compelling. While Radiohead are often bogged down
    by over-ambitious themes, they're at least constructing a poetics of experimentation, as well as a cogent if somewhat
    scattered message beyond their plush walls of sound. All I can cull from this music are empty exercises in pseudo-orchetral ear candy.
    Which is fine to a point: Sigur Ros (an easy comparison) move people to tears without the majority of their audience comprehending a
    single word of their lyrics, and like Ester Drang, they aren't exactly breaking new ground.  Unlike Ester Drang, their stuff is a gale of
    goddamn triumph; <i>Infinite Keys</i> rumbles by like a draft through a cracked window, a tiny shift in the atmosphere, leaving only the
    vaguest of impressions.</p></div>"|2839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2839-infinite-keys/|6.4|Brandon Stosuy

I'm not being callous here, suggesting that the world is better off without him; I'm saying that the escalation of the conflict in Israel, the invasion of Afghanistan, and the current war in the Iraq probably would have collectively driven Jones completely over the edge. Perhaps his death spared him unimaginable suffering.</p>
<p>While he was alive, Jones felt an intense anger at Israel and the United States, and sympathy for the plight of the Arab world generally and Palestinians specifically (he wasn't exactly opposed to terrorism either). Jones' stance was not borne of experience (he never actually visited the Middle East), religion (he was not a Muslim) or community (he didn't know or care what the Islamic world thought of his work). He was simply outraged at the existence of the state of Israel and the West's imperialist policies.</p>
<p>Because Jones was a workaholic, his anger found an outlet in recording, and he was pissed off, indeed: The discography page of his official website lists more than 150 releases since 1982. I didn't look closely to see how many of those are albums proper, but it's a lot. If he were alive today, with everything that's happening, he'd probably be putting out a new album every two hours. The pace would kill him.</p>
<p>Because Muslimgauze was so prolific, new records still appear almost monthly, three years after his death. It's difficult to imagine that one day there simply won't be any more Muslimgauze material in the vaults. Maybe it won't happen in my lifetime. But for now, the new releases keep on coming, and relatively casual fans such as myself can sit back and cherry-pick the good stuff.</p>
<p><i> Hamas Cinema Gaza Strip </i> contains material Jones recorded in 1998, which wasn't originally released until last year and has now been repressed in a limited edition. No one expects one Muslimgauze release to sound dramatically different from another-- at his pace, he was bound to repeat himself. Rather, Jones' tracks are built from variations of about a dozen distinct and identifiable Muslimgauze styles.</p>
<p>This record can be classified as mostly stripped-down Muslimgauze: generally easy on the noise, with steady, hip-hop-informed beats, and no dub touches or ambient interludes. It also has a lot of what made Muslimgauze interesting. Jones' greatest accomplishment, musically, was his genius with percussion. The sheer power and authority of his drum tracks never fails to impress, and so it is with <i> Hamas Cinema Gaza Strip </i> .</p>
<p>Nobody ever has or will mix a midtempo hip-hop beat with distorted djembe fills like Muslimgauze does here on ""Hezbollah Radio Advert"". You can tell it's him instantly, with the unnerving blend of the clean (the driving 4/4 bit) and the filthy (the seriously overdriven hand drums). Bits of Arabic dialog, another Muslimgauze signature, buzz randomly over the rhythm. The title track uses a similar combination of sounds, but with loose, improvisational hand percussion and sweeping string samples that sound like they could be ripped from ""Kashmir"". ""Izlamiq Groupe"" on the other hand, is slow and druggy, with deep tabla pulses, samples of sitar, and an odd contrast as a pitter-patter of electric shocks dancing on top. These are all prime Muslimgauze tracks.</p>
<p>The record gets more abrasive as it goes on. ""Rent a Hookah"" is hard, noisy techno with just a few Middle Eastern elements, and the drums in ""Balti Utensil"", though not particularly fast, inch into the red. Still, <i> Hamas Cinema Gaza Strip </i> is not a particularly punishing Muslimgauze release, so it wouldn't be a bad place to start for the uninitiated. He surely made 50 albums better than this one, and 100 or more worse. The important thing is to dive in <i> somewhere </i> and check it out. No one sounds like Muslimgauze.</p></div>"|5525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5525-hamas-cinema-gaza-strip/|7.3|Mark Richardson

It's like they were going
    up against New York's haute couture music trends, but went with the pocket tee: sturdy, comfortable and not too striking.  Those
    of you who look to the competitive Brooklyn Diaspora for the most exciting, battle-tested new rock may not be floored, but the Holy Ghost
    are a solid guitar band that at least knows how to write a song and sing it like lives are at stake.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Color Sympathy</i>, the second of two albums they cut last year, the Holy Ghost combine a mutt-like mix of influences.  Their style is consistent
    enough not to be showy, but broad enough to explain how they could win support slots with everyone from the Dismemberment Plan to the Damned; if
    you had to sum them up in a couple words, I'd go with ""heartfelt"" and ""ponderous"".   From the first cut they deploy barreling guitars and hyper-earnest
    vocals, lurching on the title track between big crests and deeply-felt ruts.  That song and the closer-- the dragged-out ""Pinocchio's Nose""-- heavily
    bookend the album, as the rest of the album moves from ballads to rockers without ever shaking off that leaden intent.</p><p>
    
    Some of the blame lies with Christopher Dean Heine.  A forceful singer, he wails with overwrought machismo, but he can't overcome the fact that if
    everything sounds important, nothing actually is.  ""Sunday's Calling"" would be a Spoon-worthy rock 'n' roll song if Heine didn't sing it like he was
    working on a difficult bowel movement.  Not afraid of dishing out wordy imagery, he gets off some sharp lyrics-- the alliterative ""like a libertine
    from Lawrence, Kansas,"" or the seductive come-on, ""your mother looks like Sharon Tate""-- but he drops into pomposity, proclaiming the ""Berlin Wall
    was destroyed by rock and roll.""  He gets his rock on for the Walkmen-like ""Snow White"", which kicks off with only drums backing his voice--
    finally raspy, and spitting authority-- and at last ponies up some real excitement.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the band mostly stays where they're put-- the throwaway instrumental ""Toledo"", for example, makes them sound solid if not extraordinary;
    to their credit the Holy Ghost are very tight, and probably great in concert.  The ballads become rumbling and atmospheric thanks to guitarist Alec
    Ferrell, who has a mighty, wide sound with just a little shimmer; when it's time to get loud, he lays on a gritty, distorted tone that'll wake
    up the back rows.  ""Berlin Wall"" sounds eerily close to late-period XTC: the band's real strength is never
    writing a song that runs too fast or skimps on tunes.</p><p>
    
    With just eight songs run through in under half an hour, <i>Color Sympathy</i> has the over-before-it-really-starts feel of an EP.  It's well-balanced,
    well-rounded and well-played; it's confident, and it's not too trendy.  But it also feels like the work of a strong opening act for a more accomplished
    headliner-- too often it's emotional without nuance, loud without pizzazz, catchy, but not grabbing.  <i>Color Sympathy</i> is good enough to get them
    big shows, but the Holy Ghost need to push things farther to earn a cushy time slot.</p></div>"|3911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3911-color-sympathy/|6.7|Chris Dahlen

Formed in 1996 by members
    of Dazzling Killmen, Mars Volta, Panicsville, Craw and Chalk, they began as the next logical step for hardcore bands wanting
    just a bit more to chew on than shards of metallic noise and haphazard speed-beat.  However, where most musicians
    with the cumulative pedigree of this quartet would either be playing straight jazz or make a nice livings as mercenary
    session men, LB channeled their muso energies into a tightly wound ball of steel rods.</p><p>
    
    As a group, they effortlessly
    converged at the service of drive and trance, occasionally jutting out unpredictably into harsher realms.  Live, they
    were a powerhouse (perhaps drummer Blake Fleming learned a few things during his tenure with Zeni Geva), and though their
    recorded history is brief, it demonstrates a remarkable range of expression, precision and raw power.  I've read comparisons
    to This Heat, Can and Albert Ayler, and while dropping names is usually a quick, cheap way to avoid describing music, in this
    case I think it really does pay tribute to the quality of their stuff.  In short, Laddio Bolocko were fucking awesome.</p><p>
    
    And now, they're gone.  Sorry, you missed them.  The guys are still playing (Fleming and Marcus DeGrazia in Electric Turn
    to Me; Drew St. Ivany and Ben Armstrong in The Psychic Paramount), but if you want to see LB now, you'll have to check out
    the video clip for ""As If By Remote"" on <i>Life &amp; Times of Laddio Bolocko</i>.  This two-disc set collects the entire recorded legacy of a
    band that might very well have become the premiere representatives of the noise/prog/kraut/jazz legacy as put forth by the
    aforementioned legends, and host of others currently receiving mega props (Flying Luttenbachers, Lightning Bolt, Ruins).</p><p>
    
    The first disc of <i>Life &amp; Times</i> contains 1997's <i>Strange Warmings of Laddio Bolocko</i>, and is the more rambunctious of the two.
    ""Goat Lips"" opens on a pseudo-fanfare of guitar and drums, sun-beaming riffs reaching toward the sky like a bizarro
    universe prog band that didn't realize they were supposed to insert a keyboard solo in the middle of all that commotion.
    Before things get too stagnant-- and they never do; one of LB's strengths was they were able to play repetitive music that
    didn't seem redundant-- they launch a kinetic, jackhammer groove that might fit well on a new Boredoms CD if it was just a tad less
    funky.  They change again, playing an emergency-siren guitar riff while Fleming slams anything in sight.  It's a
    beautiful sound, and they're just getting started.</p><p>
    
    ""Call Me Jesus"" and ""Nurser"" emphasize the pure noise aspects of LB's sound, though still with enough a sense of pulse as
    to grant them post-rock membership on a technicality.  Again, though they tend to hit a beat and stick with it, the small
    details-- DeGrazia's horn interjections in the right speaker, or the vaguely King Crimson-esque ""chorus"" blasts-- make
    very little go a long way.  This pays major dividends on the unthinkably massive ""Y Toros"", which finds a few hundred ways
    to play the same three notes during its 34-minute tour.  In much the same way This Heat played with rhythm on ""Repeat"", LB
    very rarely let a phrase go by the same way twice.  Furthermore, they take almost ten minutes to climax; that may sound
    gratuitous, and I'm sure some folks are going to run screaming from the room during parts of the second half of the piece,
    but if extended foreplay with a messy peak is your game, this band wants to love you.</p><p>
    
    The second disc collects 1998's <i>In Real Time</i> and 1999's <i>As If By Remote</i>, documenting the band's considerable growth
    over its short lifespan.  ""As If By Remote"" is exotic drone, full of disparate sound-bites, jungle bounce and a Middle Eastern
    guitar riff that leaves a dreamy haze over the entire tune-- a state perfected on the practically untouchable ""The Going
    Gong"".  ""A Passing State of Well-Being"" serves up the sunny organ chords, similar to the vibe of the first tune on the other
    disc, but adds flute and a metronomic funk beat to transform what would be run-of-the-mill Chicago post-rock into muscular
    psychedelia.  Similarly, ""Laddio's Money (Death of A Popsong)"" takes two chords and half a riff to construct what should
    be the world's most inept attempt at a Ted Nugent song into avant-garage greatness.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, if instrumental freak-outs of any variety aren't your bag, Laddio Bolocko might induce migraines.  Yet this is rarely
    ""noisy"" music: where their would-be peers are going for the loudest and fastest riffs imaginable, pushing boundaries of sound into
    thresholds of pain, LB seemed to have been heading in a more textured direction.  It's too bad we won't get to hear where they might
    have ended up, because bands that can craft delicate stones as well as rocky rave-ups aren't terribly common.  In any case, <i>Life &amp;
    Times</i> comes very recommended for those in need of a jam.</p></div>"|4626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4626-the-life-times-of-laddio-bolocko/|8.5|Dominique Leone

    an isolated thing-in-itself: please don't beat me up in the parking lot behind the Pitchfork Mobile HQ (by
    the way, our boombox-shaped Aerostar will be rocking Danzaville, Montana this week, and the first fifteen
    people to sign up for a Pitchfork Citibank Mastercard will win coupons for pepperoni condoms from Doug's
    Planned Parenthood Pizza Hospice). You see, I swore I would write a decontextualized, non-self-reflective
    review of this mother. But three of the four Joan of Arc releases covered by Pitchfork received ratings
    ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 by the site's vaunted saint Brent DiCrescenzo, whose name is hurled at me in
    countless hateful emails, evoking Sam Kinison's old routine about the hypothetical tortured sibling of
    Christ who had to bear mother Mary yelling, ""Why can't you be more perfect like your brother Jesus?""</p><p>
    
    God rest his soul and arrange for seraphim to pet him with Fig Newtons, but I think the DiCrescenzo-ian
    resentment of the DuChamp-ian and DeBord-ian Tim Kinsella was only half-right (hence my doubling of his
    approximation of their worth). He accurately diagnosed Joan of Arc as a hip accouterment, a name on a
    poster to be hung above the porcelain piss-portals of a zillion clubgoers' sublets. But his dismissals
    too aggressively charge that the band is pretentious. This word gets thrown at anyone who mentions a
    theorist or poet or painter or Frenchman, but the word connotes pretending, and many of the people who
    cite theorists, poets, painters and Frenchmen aren't pretending; they're very much knowledgeable, and
    often passionate, about the ""names"" they're ""dropping."" Kinsella has been doing his fragile art-pud thing
    too long to still be considered a dilettante, though I admit that the line between ornate absurdist and
    fashion victim can be hard to trace. Typos in the lyric booklet further disservice his smarty-pants image.</p><p>
    
    Alas: This stupidly titled album is not good enough to escape the vestigial diss, resulting in the lowest
    rating of my first full year of taking my CD opinions too seriously (as for the 6.1 that I regrettably gave
    Looper's <i>The Snare</i>, I was young, I needed the money, and a 24-hour clinic was conveniently across
    the street-- even this Joan of Arc disc is better). My mammy raised a polite pushover, and I have been
    fortunate to have not had to review much crap, but this album accomplishes too little with its talent pool,
    forcing me to spank-rate it, perhaps fallaciously, based on its potential.</p><p>
    
    Tim Kinsella's last two helpings of frantic-to-lackadaisical gazebo-core, under the auspices of Owls and
    Friend/Enemy (color-coded on the CD spine to read ""Free in My End,"" one burl in a string of Kinsella's dodgy
    homoerotic/anal come-ons/blow-offs), were strong enough to recruit me as a Kinsella Apologist.  I took up
    for the weasel, against a churning sea of discontent. But this album, and brother Mike Kinsella's recent
    ill-sung bucket of merely passable dirge-pop (Owen's <i>No Good for No One Now</i>) have persuaded me to
    lobby for the other side. Whereas Victor Villareal's guitar work in Owls brought the instrument the closest
    it's ever come to replicating water, Kinsella's plink-and-strum here is way mathier, despite how majestically
    the salamandrine, rapid finger-yoga sections of ""Olivia List"" impress.</p><p>
<i>So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness</i> is Owls on downers, or a Friend/Enemy that checked itself into
    an asylum. At some point, I stopped listening to it and began tolerating it. As gifted/studied as these
    musicians are, their contrapuntal arrangements and fidgety time signatures become, gasp, predictable. The
    steel drum on ""Madelleine Laughing"", is as adventurous as some of Friend/Enemy's (Need New Body-sponsored)
    scattershot pioneering, but the song is limp. The rest of the percussion is minimal and stilted, supporting
    the other players' experimental girth like canary legs beneath an elephant. When the band jazzes things up
    with the complex disco and muted coronet of ""The Infinite Blessed Yes"", they just sound like a homeless
    Steely Dan. Joan of Arc has abandoned the pastiche ethic of past albums to create compositions that flirt
    with being... songs.  But that doesn't mean they go anywhere.  While there has always been something
    inessential about Joan of Arc, this thing just languishes, ignoring the indie rock expectancy for gratifying
    blasts/spectacle like a cow chewing cud in a race against a combine.</p><p>
    
    Many Joan of Arc songs' dark undertones suggest the ominousness of the everyday, that something about
    normalcy is askew, but this approach gets cloying. Which is why the strangely optimistic-sounding tracks
    stand out like styrofoam anchors. The aforementioned ""Olivia List"", the sprightly ""Mean to March"", and
    ""Mr. Participation Billy"" are the album's most interesting numbers, the latter a near-homage to Tom Waits'
    Coney Island carnage-barking, a catalog of urban violence replete with tragicomic falsettos straight outta
    <i>Frank's Wild Years</i>.</p><p>
    
    Kinsella's previous two projects were aided by his best lyrics yet. These aren't so gripping, though he has
    ventured from his old Joan of Arc tack of Gertrude Stein-meets-(forgive this potentially offensive term for
    mangled Japanese commercial speech)-Engrish. These ""natural"" lyrics, though, suck: stream-of-consciousness,
    and premeditated, adlibbing, what-I-did-today spiels don't benefit from Kinsella's not screaming; the man
    has a guttural shriek as divine as Isaac Brock's, but you ain't getting it on this mumbly platter. Instead
    you encounter a speakeasy flat-croon, similar to how Will Oldham's been whispery of late, denying us his
    warbles and yelps. The ""poetry"" spoken at the end of the album is some of the wimpiest, wimpiest, wimpiest,
    unstomachably windy, emo-phillips, carbon-dated gossip-nostril, tantrum-panties, messiah-nipple,
    seventh-grade, goober-whittling, scruple-dink sweater-vest hobo-trigger,  nut-kneading, mouth-breathing,
    pope-diving, womb-sniffing crap I've ever heard.</p><p>
    
    The album feels lazy. This band would probably snigger at my apocalyptic melodrama, but I wish they'd create
    a record with the idea that it was their last, and that it had to be as awesome as they could make it.
    Because this product, as ""searchingly"" misanthropic and intentionally misproportioned as a Todd Solondz
    film, constitutes bad faith. I will spare you my Joan of Arc/Pavement analogy, about how they're both
    ""slack,"" love ""wordplay,"" feature bad singers who are great guitarists, and smirk like nothing is ever
    at stake, with Pavement's poppiness and cavalier cocksurity distinguishing them, but I will go ahead and
    say that <i>So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness</i> is a <i>Terror Twilight</i>, a mellow, slightly
    sub-decent album delivered at the wrong time.</p><p>
    
    I guarantee that there will never be a point at which you will say, ""Oh shit! I've got to play <i>[I Refuse
    to Type That Album Title Again]</i>!"" The world is cray-zy, right, yet when this disc spins, I can only think of
    speed metal band Death Angel's singular locution, the chorus of the ""hit"" from their 1988 breakthrough
    <i>Frolic Through the Park</i>: ""I'm bored.""</p></div>"|4265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4265-so-much-staying-alive-and-lovelessness/|4.2|William Bowers

    Pollard's body of work, and simply excise the dead weight from the public consciousness.  Ahh, but it's a
    pipe dream; there are more Bob Pollard songs than grains of sand, or stars in the sky.  Who has that kind
    of time?  Pollard certainly doesn't-- he's busy writing all these goddamn songs.  Fans have been pleading
    for years that he use some judgment about what songs deserve to go on his records and stop releasing 18
    records a year, to no avail.  Simple logic says that it could spark interest in his music again, or produce
    his best album in years.  He has clearly shown, with one or two decent tracks on each release in his Fading
    Captain series, that he still has it in him to write hooks as strong as those that made his mid-90s classics
    canonical indie releases.</p><p>
    Until this happens, his loyal fans are left (yet again) unsatisfied, sitting despondently on the edge of
    the bed in the <i>Motel of Fools</i>, the sixth tragicomic Pollard solo release.  Why is a gentle, shrinking
    violet like ""Captain Black"" forced to hold hands with the indulgent, incoherent slob ""Red Ink Superman""?
    Why is ""The Spanish Hammer"" even permitted in the same area code?  Only Bob knows for sure.  There are
    plenty of questions and precious few answers, I'm afraid, as the violent disparity in quality is perhaps
    more pronounced on this ""mini-LP"" than on any of his prior work (and that's really saying something).
    <i>Motel of Fools</i> is yet another face-off between songs that by rights should become insti-classics,
    a couple of cuts that should have gotten Pollard kicked off his own album, and a vast no-man's-land in
    between.</p><p>
    In the theme of his other solo albums, Bob takes the opportunity to try his hand with slightly more
    unconventional (at least in comparison with his normal output) structures and effects.  For the most part,
    these forays into sampling and tape manipulation fail spectacularly, and the two worst offenders are those
    mentioned above.  Only three minutes of worthwhile music inhabit the cavernous 5\xBD-minute span of ""Red Ink
    Superman""; the remainder of the void is filled by little more than aimless, disconnected noise that has
    little or nothing to do with the actual song.  ""The Spanish Hammer"" is to be appreciated as an experiment,
    maybe, but the only result that can be drawn from it is an object lesson in how easily a track can be
    destroyed by unchecked tape aggression.  Viewed as an actual piece of music, it's virtually unlistenable.</p><p>
    There's an outside chance I'm expecting too much from Bob, of course-- his greatest triumphs have been laid
    at the base of the great Tower of Song, distilled pop anthems of the highest caliber.  As such, he's probably
    still coming to grips with the nuances of ""noise.""  They might fare better in other circumstances, but
    charitably, they're still monstrously out of place here next to some of the most emotive, understated tunes
    he's ever penned.</p><p>
    Pollard has devoted his considerable pop sensibilities to a few shy numbers, mainly
    forsaking fist-pumping hooks for simple, intimate ballads like ""In the House of Queen Charles Augustus""
    and the painfully, beautifully morose ""Saga of the Elk"".  Even as ""Harrison Adams"" nearly swells to
    arena-busting proportions, Pollard's powerfully self-conscious chorus of, ""You're not happy with me,""
    brings it back to its emotional center.  Simply put, when Pollard gives the knobs a rest on <i>Motel of
    Fools</i>, he glimpses the same interstellar heights he always does on these releases, hearkening back to
    the sepia-tinged glory days of vintage GBV.  Unfortunately, he also reminds us why we all began questioning
    him in the first place.</p></div>"|6378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6378-motel-of-fools/|6.9|Eric Carr

It was shuttered in the last
    round of base closings, recently enough that it still appears in most atlases and maps of the area.
    Developers seem to have bought nearly all the land, and in just a couple of months, have constructed what
    must be literally thousands of houses; the only thing to suggest the land's past utility is the old
    airstrip control tower, which has incongruously been left standing.  It looks like they're converting
    the building into a mall or something.</p><p>
    
    This patch of land changed completely, almost overnight, from barracks and hangars to multifamily housing,
    strip mall shopping, and the now-ubiquitous mini-mansions that each get their own sixth of an acre to sit
    on.  Anyone familiar with the old base wouldn't recognize it at all.  Such rapid change is rare, and it's
    easy to be caught off-guard if you aren't expecting the change, which in this case I was.  I was as struck
    by the dramatically altered landscape of this new Los Halos record.  It's so incredibly divergent from the
    Lionstown, Pennsylvania band's eponymous debut that hardly sounds like the same band; the feel and the
    sound are both totally different this time around.</p><p>
    
    Where their debut was drenched in noisy explosions of guitar and built on epic, psychedelic songcraft, there's
    nary an outburst to be found here, as acoustic guitars have almost completely replaced electrics.  They
    once stepped on your foot and poked you in the eye, but <i>For Ramona</i> sounds at times like it's floating out of an old,
    wooden radio with cloth-covered tube speakers.  The whole record is a hazy, languid affair bordering on folk, and
    oddly, the change suits Los Halos well.</p><p>
    
    Led by an intriguing individual going under the pseudonym Samezvous (no word on whether he's considering
    changing it to make it sound less French), the contributions of the several other listed members of Los Halos
    are somewhat indeterminate (a quick web search reveals that one of them is named Momo Fatts, which is just too awesome for
    words).  Samezvous kicks things off a million miles from hi-fi recording gear and drum sets, strumming old strings
    and singing in a tone that suggests he's got a secret to tell you.  He employs this technique
    several times, bordering on a whisper; he's most successful on the deflated ""Losst Halo"" (sic), which sounds like
    Spiritualized's Jason Pierce losing his wife and his recording budget at the same time.</p><p>
<i>For Ramona</i> sports about five tracks that suggest Los Halos are on the verge of developing a sound of their own
    invention, and a couple of them are truly stunning.  The title track is an inviting, cozy waltz
    brimming with melody and subtle dynamics that suggests they haven't lost their penchant for volume entirely.
    ""Gold As the Color"" follows up even better, opening with a repetitive, slightly processed vocal melody and
    unfolding, almost like a loop-based electronica track, gradually expanding with varied, repeating layers of
    instrumental and vocal parts, ultimately bursting forth with melodious xylophone in the song's final third.</p><p>
    
    Later in the album, ""Morning of the Sun"" feels a little like American Analog Set with its buzzing organ drone,
    brushed drums and chorused bassline, but it's also cut through with a hook that's downright bluesy; it's weird
    and simultaneously wonderful.  ""Dagger Bones"" takes that template to its logical pop extreme,
    brushing up against Sparklehorse and the glow of Fridmann-phonics in the process.  If it wasn't as lo-fi,
    the record's closer ""Will You Go to Heaven?"" could be pretty bloated, with its ""We Are the World"" keyboards and Dream Academy
    chord progressions; it comes off instead as a quiet, humble anthem with an uncertain message in its ""Will you
    go to Heaven?  And all that's wrong with you?"" refrain.</p><p>
    
    So color me very surprised.  I was expecting a big, militant stomp of swirling noise, and instead ended up in a
    quiet housing development full of cozy charm and considered craft.  Such a wholesale change in sound seems like
    it would be difficult to pull off, but Los Halos have not had much trouble doing it.  If anything,
    they've gotten a lot better, and I can't wait to see where they go next.</p></div>"|4862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4862-for-ramona/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    was totaled and both of his legs were mangled, Otto Von Schirach awoke, six months later, from a painkiller
    haze, disoriented and confused.  The psychological effects of his trauma drastically altered his approach
    to music: Less melodic, more chaotic, light on the thoughtful, and heavy on the unbridled subconsciousness.
    The resulting series of three EPs, collected here as <i>Chopped Zombie Fungus</i>, are residual products of
    Schirach's ""accident,"" macabre and chaotic threads of intravenous beats and bed-pan bass that fold hip-hop,
    booty house and layer upon layer of processed noise into his hospital bedsheets, soaking them in night
    sweats and urine.</p><p>
    
    That's the story, anyway. The plot. The reality is that life-altering tragedy has never sounded as good as
    it does when filtered through Schirach's delusional mind, fabricated or legit. Besides being a fine marriage
    of product and packaging (both the furry scrotum flipping the bird on the sleeve of the third EP, <i>Earjuice
    Synthesis</i> and the post-apocalyptic hardware warriors on <i>Boombonic Plague</i>, both designed by
    illustrator AS1, are an essential backdrop), <i>Chopped Zombie Fungus</i> manages to take the most
    predictable elements of the Schematic sound and frappe it into something tormented and way outside of the
    box, a sound as frightening and surreal as it is pop-lockin'.</p><p>
    
    And in almost every instance, that conversion is a success.  <i>Chopped Zombie Fungus</i> twitches its way
    through the dancefloor underworld, rubbing up against gyrating asses and thrusting pelvi as it searches for
    the Champagne Room, occasionally grabbing the mic and kicking a rancid verse. The Brian Eno-esque delivery
    that Schirach exhibits on ""Earjuice Synthesis (Urinate on MCs)"" becomes increasingly fresh with each listen,
    a strange sing-song that approximates Bodenstandig 2000 with its fractured, atonal rhythm; couplets like,
    ""Organized bubble bass/ Begin fisting the speaker,"" become deranged manifestos, lurking behind rumbling
    bass swells and breaks that writhe and twitter like dying millipedes.</p><p>
    
    Nothing here could be classified as
    sunny, and all things are not as they seem; only David Lynch could have daydreamed ""Pelican Moondance"", a
    fevered hallucination in which some Sri Lankan ceremonial samba gets wrapped up with an anesthetized,
    ancient starlet droning ""Bessame Mucho"" until her throat bleeds, and the aggressive new wave stomp of
    ""Laptops&amp;Martinis;"" is just the right mix of mutilated party anthem and breakneck cut/paste lunacy. ""Whip
    Me Down"" is less successful, so preoccupied with barking S&amp;M; commands (""Whip me down/ Make me hurt/ Make
    me bleed/ Touch my tit"") that its promising ghetto-tech beats are allowed to wander off into oncoming
    traffic. But ""Boombonic Plague"" recovers the ball with the grace of a quadriplegic prostitute, cramming
    in enough cum-soaked booty house and disembodied demon children to rival GGG for sheer sensory perversion.
    No wonder it's the cut that kicked off the series.</p><p>
    
    If there's a weakness to this compilation, it's not fire or decapitation or a shotgun blast to the dome,
    but the complete lack of restraint Schirach exhibits on many of the tracks. For sure, all three EPs are a
    product of frenzied, albeit revelatory, self-indulgence; but when things get out of hand, the listener gets
    buried alive beneath the studio noodling.  The barely together ""Sliced Mucus Farts"" dries up quickly while
    ""Granny Foot Powder"" falters, suffering from too many aborted passages. I'll admit that it might take me
    years to decipher what's going on at the recess-and-Thorazine core of ""San Lorenzo"", but it seems like
    extraneous information, one too many B-movie sequels. Then again, more than an hour's worth of carnage
    takes its toll on a man. The sickness of it all leaves you stumped.</p><p>
    
    As any of the undead realize, things are better ripped apart, split into pieces and gnawed at patiently.
    Taken in pieces, the true depths of Otto Von Schirach's scheme are better comprehended, easier to swallow
    and easier to flip than skip. The aim of <i>Chopped Zombie Fungus</i> takes time to absorb, and some cuts
    (like ""Facelift"") suggest eggs being laid under rotting logs, waiting. It's something for which Lucio Fulci
    and Gescom combined may be no match. This collection is <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>; only the monsters
    are horny, hungry, and fighting off Atomic Zombies on the shore of Bikini Beach, amped up on pheromones in
    <i>Clockwork Orange</i> skivvies.</p><p>
    
    Otto, you done did George Romero proud.</p></div>"|8493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8493-chopped-zombie-fungus/|7.7|Mark Martelli

    Yokota's work with Leaf. In his native Japan he's released an uncountable
    number of records under many different names in every dance music style
    imaginable, and this IDM/ambient stuff is seen as an esoteric side project.
    Meanwhile, though he's never made much of an impact on the stateside dance
    scene, those interested in more abstract electronics have shown an
    increasing interest in the ambient series started in the last few years,
    highlights of which include <i>Sakura</i> and <i>Grinning Cat</i>.</p><p>
    
    I mention Yokota's tangled history to point up that, despite his prodigious
    output, he never makes the same album twice. Though his records on Leaf
    sometimes share certain moods and qualities, Yokota is constantly varying
    arrangements and instrumental textures. With <i>The Boy and the Tree</i>,
    Yokota discards completely the hushed, patient melodies of <i>Sakura</i>
    and <i>Grinning Cat</i> and builds most tracks around sampled percussion.
    The dynamic range is still flat enough for many of these tracks to sound
    calm and internal, but I would hesitate to use the word ""ambient"" to
    describe a good half of this record.</p><p>
    
    Yokota's primary interest on <i>The Boy and the Tree</i> seems to be the
    emotional quality of percussion as it inhabits an acoustic space. The
    woodblocks, djembe, and metallic bells that fill up ""Live Echo"" aren't
    ordered into particularly interesting patterns, but the way they seem to
    bounce off the stone enclosures that surround them is intriguing. ""Grass,
    Tree and Stone"" has similarly steady and repetitive drums at its core, and
    it adds the kind of twitching guitar reverb one associates with Ennio
    Morricone. Both these tracks have buried somewhere in the percussion
    wailing tribal voices of indeterminate origin. ""Plateau on Plateau"" also
    uses loops of processed guitar and voices, but the percussion here comes
    from bells and what sounds like hands beating on thick leather pads.</p><p>
    
    A few other tracks on <i>The Boy and the Tree</i> follow the same template
    as the ones I've mentioned, and for the most part, I find this lot to be on
    the dull side. The tight, unwavering way Yokota has sequenced these loops
    makes it too easy for them to slip completely into the background. Once the
    layers fall in and the sounds are set in motion, the pattern basically repeats
    until Yokoto pulls the plug. The drum sounds chosen come from the family of
    percussion most of us would associate with collective activity-- improvisations,
    celebrations, drum circles and the like. And without the variation that comes
    from communication, the tracks seem flat and lifeless, if sonically impressive.</p><p>
    
    But <i>The Boy in the Tree</i> has a handful of stunning tracks-- Yokota is
    just too talented for it to be otherwise. The cooing voices on ""Secret Garden"",
    though set against an overly repetitive acoustic guitar pattern, are haunting,
    and Yokota wisely cuts the almost too-beautiful voices with odd swells of noise.
    And while I can't say ""Thread Leads to Heaven"" is the most original of tracks
    (it's basically a minimalist canon thing played on what sounds like a toy organ),
    I am utterly powerless to resist its wide-eyed charm and simple sense of wonder.
    So, the mildly curious shouldn't worry about missing this Yokota release.
    Besides, there will certainly be another one along shortly.</p></div>"|8876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8876-the-boy-and-the-tree/|6.0|Mark Richardson

Not only is it <i>not</i> headed for a war only 37% of its population
    approves of, it has, in the past two years, become a hotbed of indie activity, unleashing stellar underground
    hip-hop from Buck 65, and Swollen Members, experimental weirdness by Godspeed You Black Emperor and Set Fire
    to Flames, the post-punk of The Constantines and Radio Berlin, and the stunning pop of bands like The New
    Pornographers, Broken Social Scene, and, of course, Hot Hot Heat.</p><p>
<i>Make Up the Breakdown</i> was truly one of the most uniquely entertaining rock records of 2002. A
    curiously appealing batch of organ-driven rockers, packed with twisted-up melodies and breakneck time
    changes, it made for a half-hour of music that was, above all else, incredibly fun-- and mere weeks after
    its release, it sent these Victoria-based hipsters into the indie-hype stratosphere.</p><p>
    
    The music seemed pre-packaged to shun labeling, but at its base we could detect a steady balance of new wave
    quirk and post-punk angularity, with the throaty, viciously overwrought vocals of Steve Bays making or
    breaking the band for listeners.  Those who dug his unusual style, or could at least get beyond it, found
    a markedly original album, free of the navelgazing emo pretensions that taint so many of their indie rock
    brethren.  In short, <i>Make Up the Breakdown</i> inspired as much dancing and good cheer as it did
    journalistic hyperbole-- an attribute that Warner Bros. surely took into account when signing the band
    near the end of the year.</p><p>
    
    So it seems only logical that at least some semblance of <i>Make Up the Breakdown</i>'s sound would exist
    on <i>Scenes One Through Thirteen</i>, a compilation of old seven-inch EPs that showcases the band in their
    noisier, scruffier, and ultimately less enjoyable embryonic stage.  Unfortunately, these songs, while far
    more crunchy and furious than anything on <i>Breakdown</i>, tend to approach tedium in their sheer brutality;
    though it all makes for music jagged enough to cause lacerations, it's rarely likeable on its own terms.</p><p>
    
    There are three chief problems here: one is the grating, guttural vocals of the massively hardcore-influenced
    ex-frontman Matthew Marnik, who was later kicked out of the band and replaced by then-keyboardist Bays;
    second, despite its hardcore leanings, the album lacks any guitar whatsoever, with the band leaning on
    only keyboards, drums and vocals; and lastly, there's scarcely a melody to be found.  The band's grasp on
    unconventional song structure, distinctive arrangements and jerky dynamics are all present, but Hot Hot Heat
    neglect to craft any real songs around them-- in fact, they seem stubbornly preoccupied with simply grinding
    as hard as they possibly can, with little regard for anything else.  The record's overt hot-bloodedness
    quickly becomes pedestrian as these unstable, atonal tracks tend to blend together without finding much
    purpose-- perhaps that's why they were originally released as seven-inches.</p><p>
    
    If nothing else, <i>Scenes One Through Thirteen</i> does make for an interesting sort of where-were-they-then
    archival document, proving that, as a rhythmic unit, they were always pretty tight (check Paul Hawley's
    ruthless, multi-dimensional drumming).  It also further lifts confidence for what they may be able to achieve
    by the time their next record sees release.  But even so, I wouldn't imagine the group has enough die-hard
    fans to warrant the release of what essentially amounts to old demos-- a sound they themselves have entirely
    disowned, and even now seem embarrassed of.  Which all leaves <i>Scenes One Through Thirteen</i>, at best, a
    moderately interesting chronicle of Hot Hot Heat's development from volatile screamers into the unique pop
    band they are today.</p></div>"|3926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3926-scenes-one-through-thirteen/|4.7|Matt Stephens

Did you know that Hezbollah operates a satellite TV network called Al Mana that boasts
    a viewership of 10 million and even features English-language news?  True story.  Its primary purpose is to
    recruit young Palestinians into martyr brigades, via detailed instructions and the now-proverbial 72-virgin
    retirement plan.  In short, it's a TV network whose main objective is convincing its viewers to kill
    themselves.</p><p>
    
    This pretty much happens to be Luke Haines' modus operandi, as well. There are talented songwriters who
    make disdain for the listener a part of their mystique (yup, Will Oldham), but Haines must be the only
    one to fashion it into a persistent lyrical trope. The very first Black Box Recorder single, ""Child
    Psychology"", extended you an invitation to ""kill yourself or get over it."" A quick skim through Haines'
    back catalog yields more fizzy bile.  To date, the man has lit aircraft on fire, ordered girls to sing in
    the wreckage, implicated the listener in child murders and kidnappings, mused about blowing up clubs and
    murdering artists, and proposed marriage to Andy Warhol's attempted assassin Valerie Solanas.  There's
    also his work as Baader-Meinhof, which glorified the legendary German anarchists of the same name, from
    their first demented meeting to their mass suicide in jail. It was a funk album.</p><p>
    
    Haines has mellowed only once, on 2000's <i>The Facts of Life</i>, crafting the eponymous single-- an affectionate
    semi-spoken treatise on puberty-- that somehow became a minor UK hit. As British reviewers methodically noted,
    it could have been even more popular had Haines not referred to his record label as ""fucking cunts"" in an
    interview.  The <i>Top of the Pops</i> moment came and went but the taste of it fuels the entirety of <i>Passionoia</i>,
    his third album with Black Box Recorder.  The CD is a blunt parody of a ""success is hell"" concept album,
    wherein hilarity stems from the fact that <i>The Facts of Life</i> wasn't that big of a smash: In order to
    properly disdain his success, Haines has to wildly inflate it.</p><p>
<i>Passionoia</i> begins with ""The School Song"", a spoof of Black Box Recorder's sole hit and an auto-comment
    as bitter as ""Rape Me"", with none of the self-denegration. The contempt here is all outward: vocalist Sarah
    Nixey, cast as a starchy principal, spews S&amp;M-speak; (""You lot need a bit of toughening up/ You're weak and
    spoilt, look at you"") while a choir of children chant ""Black Box Recorder!""  Yes, it's as obvious as it
    sounds, and it's not only a terrible opener, but a major misstep for the band in general.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, things pick up immediately afterward, the remaining nine songs standing as almost uniformly
    terrific.  ""Being Number One"" is a Blur-ry lark listing perks of fame: ""Triumphant return to the hometown/
    Treated with love and respect/ A special school assembly/ Before, they would have broken my neck."" On ""The
    New Diana"", the band achieves accidental poignancy, even as the song's narrator is a ditz calmly listing
    her qualifications for the post of the next English Rose. ""Andrew Ridgeley"" mocks celebrity in general by
    dredging up the lesser half of Wham! for exaggerated worship.  Haines even finds time to riff on his status
    as the band's ventriloquist, having Sarah Nixey intone the lyric, ""This is Sarah Nixey talking.""</p><p>
<i>Passionoia</i> is just esoteric enough to pleasantly fluster (go decipher ""GSOH Q.E.D."", a pursed-lips
    romp through newspaper personals).  But it's also wickedly smart; if you think intelligence in indie lyrics
    must come at the expense of coherence, take in a couple of these impeccably linear narratives. The
    arrangements, meanwhile, are Haines' usual fare-- deceptively cute, a tad on the lazy side, but always
    memorable.  The funniest thing about Black Box Recorder has always been that, embodying all things British,
    they end up sounding French. This paradox is in full effect on <i>Passionoia</i>: Blippier numbers seem
    informed by Air, and chord progressions borrow from disco-era Gainsbourg.  If you confronted Luke Haines
    about it, he'd probably chalk it up to situationism and Guy Debord and free-floating signifiers. Or maybe
    he'd just say fuck it and kill you.</p></div>"|741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/741-passionoia/|8.1|Michael Idov

    <i>Parallel Lines</i> on the front porch of our NJ home. I was maybe seven.
    During a rousing ""Heart of Glass"", a kid walked past and yelled, ""Disco sucks!""
    That hurt my feelings. I wasn't a real disco fan, of course; I was too young
    to claim any kind of connoisseur status and listened to whatever my older
    sister and her friends passed to me, but this guy's invasive badmouthing
    bugged me. At the time it deflated an otherwise idyllic moment, but now
    when I think about his monolithic proclamation what bothers me most is that
    his lame genre-specificity points towards a small-minded view of music in
    which rock and disco exist as discreet objects pinned down by a few obvious
    signifiers. I mean, come on, neighborhood kid!  As if one excludes or
    precludes the other! And as if either is purely a style! Shit intersects...</p><p>
    Enter Glass Candy. Ida No (vocals), Ginger Peach (drums), and Johnny Jewel
    (guitar) have totally bad porn names and their heavy-handed take on the past
    isn't convincing or disarming, but with recent rave reviews by historical
    amnesiacs, a flurry of seven-inches on K and Troubleman, a live one-sided
    twelve-inch on Vermin Scum, some other difficult-to-find releases, and an
    upcoming cover story in <i>Jane</i>, they just might be the next big thing.</p><p>
    The cover of <i>Love Love Love</i>, their 25-minute debut LP, depicts an
    intentionally blurred image of vocalist Ida No (rhymes with Karen O!)
    staring at the listener in a sort of sedated daze. The eye contact is
    very <i>Parallel Lines</i>, but Deborah Harry was more intense and seemed
    to be for real. Continuing the theme of anachronistic appropriation, No
    sports a black and white (or black and pink?) top, 80s hairdo, and is
    superimposed over a pink-tinted Portland skyline, her image partially
    obscured by the remnants of a pink lightning bolt striking from the
    heavens on a different panel. I'm not sure if this is to be accepted as
    a sign of interstellar transmigration. Maybe It's like that Oscar Wilde
    thing in <i>Velvet Goldmine</i>?</p><p>
    No's passé pose in front of the cleanest city in which I've ever lived
    is interestingly iconic for the recent mushrooming of twenty-something
    bands obsessed with (whether they know it or not) James Chance &amp; The
    Contortions, DNA, Lydia Lunch, and the recently revived Theoretical Girls.
    In the 1980s no wave emerged largely from the gritty downtown NYC art and
    loft scenes as disco, new wave, and punk came together and jammed a bit.
    As superficially as the new crop of ""death disco"" or post-punk bands
    sounds like their forbears, the nihilism and desire to destroy paradigms
    that spurred no wave has seemingly been conveniently repackaged as little
    more than a dandified fashion statement.</p><p>
    Glass Candy are fun, but the manner in which they co-opt a storehouse of
    iconography is pathological. Of the eight tracks on the record, six are
    originals. ""Hurt"", the best song of the lot, is a revised version of
    synth-punk band The Screamers' ""I Wanna Hurt"", and the soulless reworking
    of the Rolling Stones' ""Last Time"" is passable, but nowhere near as
    compelling as Cat Power made ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"". All this
    amid the passe smoke machines, checkered ties, 70s haze, and candy font.
    If nothing else shouldn't these revivalists key their own mixed metaphors?
    Or at least exploit the shit with a smarter sense of depth?</p><p>
    The most successful purveyor of over-the-top ""art-rock"" is the underrated
    Wynne Greenwood of Tracy &amp; The Plastics. Live, through her use of self-reflexive
    video in which she stars as three ""distinct"" personality types, she turns her
    ecstatic new wave/disco/punk into an obvious performance complete with complex
    meta-narrative. Not only that, she has that Diamanda-Galas-esque voice to
    interestingly propel her dense song constructions (which also ransack hard
    rock and metal, but in a much more subtle way than the heavy-handed Glass
    Candy). Ida No, however, lacks Greenwood's vocal dexterity, and in her
    no-wave attempts to move beyond tune or tonality ends up sounding like some
    hipster doing Karaoke to Nina Hagen at some electro-clash night at some bar
    in Brooklyn. On a purely technical level, No is similar to Mariah Carey,
    pulling out all the tropes and just kind of yelling according to a
    pre-prescribed genre-specific passion.</p><p>
    Within an already heavily footnoted genre, Glass Candy are laden by reference
    points. Like a self-indulgent short story by David Foster Wallace or some
    Borgesian tale questioning originality and authorship, this simulacrum lacks
    the pure immediacy of the original, turning what was at one point a kick in
    the ass of 80s materialism into an empty pose-- something to which you can
    dance absentmindedly, wondering if the asymmetrical hairdo you just paid $150
    for looks vaguely authentic.</p></div>"|3463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3463-love-love-love/|5.2|Brandon Stosuy

Indie rock as
    we've known it, folks, is getting wrinkles, a bad back, and kidney stones.  And don't look at me like
    that-- believe me, I'm as upset about it as anyone.  It's just that Stephen Malkmus retreating to extended
    displays of technical ability, Doug Martsch retreating to acoustic Delta blues, and Liz Phair retreating to
    <i>The Matrix</i> gives me the creeping fear about the viability of our beloved genre.</p><p>
    But dry your eyes, congregation, for the ""as we've known it"" is the key here, indicating as it does the
    mid-to-late collegiate brand of indie that's held the taste of those of us snapped into musical awareness
    by <i>Nevermind</i>.  Thankfully, the term ""indie rock"" is one with little constraints regarding actual
    sound, not possessing the stylistic rules of something like ska, punk, or emo-- meaning the music thrown
    under the umbrella of ""indie rock"" can do the biologically natural thing and evolve like a muthafucka.</p><p>
    Stephen J. Gould's major contribution to the field of evolutionary biology was the concept of punctuated
    equilibrium, the idea that the evolution of a species doesn't occur at a constant rate, but consists of
    long periods of inactivity marked by occasional bursts of frenetic change.  Looking back at this point in
    time, people might point to two 2002 singles (!) as the major stimuli that caused indie rock to come under
    major selective pressure: ""House of Jealous Lovers"" by The Rapture and ""Danger! High Voltage"" by Electric
    Six (neé The Wildbunch).</p><p>
    Listen to the songs back-to-back and you'll see the similarities: both enter, run around the room, and
    leave in a steady state of arms-flailing abandon, both utilize rhythms custom-fit for the dancefloor, both
    induce muscle spasms like a doctor getting crazy with the reflex tongs.  Both songs also hinge on vocal
    hooks where the singer lets his voice fly like a Frisbee: ""House OVVV jealous lov-AHS!"" or ""Fire in the
    DISCO! Fire in the [breath] TACO BELL!""  And both came down the wire to us through resolutely non-indie
    channels-- The Rapture sliding through the wetness of the electroclash scene, Electric Six getting their
    break on 2 Many DJs' mashup opera, <i>As Heard on Radio Soulwax, Pt. 2</i>.</p><p>
    Perhaps surprisingly, given the paths they've taken, both songs have been largely accepted by the
    famous-for-their-frowns indie community, whose feet are not known for leaving the venue floor at any
    cost.  There has lately been a shift from the enforced joylessness of indie gatherings, with indie-pop
    dance nights proliferating at an alarming rate and bands like Hot Hot Heat, Liars, and Out Hud inducing
    audiences to shake their bony thrift-store hips.  The scene is primed, ladies and gentlemen, to take a
    dancy turn, trading in waves of sound and plaintive head-bobs for disco-punk beats and white-boy shimmy.
    I vaguely recollect that something of this nature happened in the early 80s-- and if you don't think the
    sound's potential has increased, consider the computers of 1982 next to our Pentium IV monsters.</p><p>
    Into this breach, as we've already covered, flies ""Danger! High Voltage"", which is finally getting official
    stateside release in the form of a quick three-song and a remix EP on XL Recordings.  The star of the show
    sounds slightly less enflamed separated from the frantic context of the 2 Many DJs mix, but still drops a
    hard beat, announcing itself with taut wah-wah guitars before exploding into fuzztone and horns while
    singer Dick Valentine duets with the White Stripes' Jack White.  White's appearance certainly eased the
    song's warm acceptance into the indie world's bosom, and his throaty yelp is the perfect complement to
    Valentine's phlegmatic growl.  Saxophone skronk, sounding good for the first time in years, only fans the
    flames even higher.</p><p>
    Part of the allure of ""Danger!"" and ""House of Jealous Lovers"", though, is their easy adaptation into more
    traditional dance club format, and the ""Thin White Duke"" remix contained here manages to barely outdo the
    source material.  Remixer Jacque Lu Cont transfers the chord progression to ominous, overdriven keyboards,
    but maintains the driving beat of the original drums and the twisted unison of White and Valentine.  It's
    an electronic-rock hybrid that sounds vaguely Prodigy-esque, but also works nicely as a combo meal of rock
    grime and electro precision; happy Faint from the Motor City.</p><p>
    The other two tracks on the EP skirt dangerously close to the garage-rock band that I suspect Electric Six
    once were, to varying danceability success.  ""I Lost Control (Of My Rock &amp; Roll)"" comes closest to being a
    respectable b-side to ""Danger! High Voltage"", built on a jagged riff and with a furiously simple vibraphone
    bridge that sounds like dancing on post-rock's grave.  ""Remote Control (Me)"", on the other hand, is
    distressingly weak, its tired guitar lines sounding somewhat ridiculous under Valentine's melodramatic,
    husky vocals and easy metaphors.  Tambourine can't save it.</p><p>
    On a longer effort, ""Remote Control (Me)"" might be a forgivable blip, but as 25% of an EP, it's a critical
    error that suggests a less-than-surefire-exciting future for the group.  And part of me wishes Electric Six
    <i>would've</i> spun the buzz from ""Danger!"" into a bona fide LP, rather than buying into the hype-feeding
    EP cycle that's being increasingly employed by the scene's hot prospects.  That, of course, might just be
    the old way of thinking-- with the sound of indie rock changing, club pressures and technology could also
    be pushing the preferred format towards shorter players.</p><p>
    It's quite possible I'm completely wrong about all this high-falutin' prophesizing-- I hate to break it to
    you, but sometimes us critics aren't quite The Weather Channel when it comes to accuracy.  But the success
    of tracks like ""House of Jealous Lovers"" and ""Danger! High Voltage"" across traditional scene lines and into
    the formerly dancephobic world of indie <i>has</i> to signal some kind of movement, one that I'd be loath
    in my duties if I didn't excitedly hypothesize about.  So my conclusion, and my advice to you, indie rocker,
    is to learn how to dance.</p></div>"|2734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2734-danger-high-voltage-ep/|7.8|Rob Mitchum

    uppers, your mother's make-up cabinet, and your grandfather's
    old 78 collection, and you'll have a sense of the tone this
    album sets in its first thirty seconds. If you just took the
    seven impeccably paced collages scattered throughout the disc,
    you'd have a riveting three minutes. The blaring rhumba outros
    and ominous brass fanfares seem to be taken from the recurring
    dream where you're Ricky Ricardo having an acid flashback. The
    Spike Jones mumbles and hambone rat-a-tat-taps, on the other
    hand, are nightmares drawn from your previous life as a
    minstrel-show manager. Yes, the interludes are marvelous. But
    it's the stuff in between-- all 35:29 of it-- that confirms my
    suspicion about an album whose title includes the word ""melody""
    more than three times. These people must have something to hide.</p><p>
    
    Let's dispel some rumors. First, The Phenomenological Boys are
    not boys. The only consistent human presence on the album is a
    female voice by turns airy, flat and thin; she sounds more like
    a prissy big sister than a boy genius. And the rest of the
    production, from the mess of vintage samples to the Casio-thin
    backgrounds, is much too concertedly juvenile to be the product
    of boyish fantasy. Then there's the issue of phenomenology. The
    only full sentences in the cutesy liner notes, an impenetrable
    quote from Husserl, don't really help anything: ""The physical
    thing belonging to nature, is nothing less than this perceived
    tree as perceived which, as perceptual sense, inseparably
    belongs to the perception."" Giant nerd-chic red herring, anyone?</p><p>
    
    Image aside, the Boys' early-TMBG-ish songwriting approach, with
    wacky samples filling out off-color textures behind loopy
    folkish hooks, had me expecting so very much. I was grinning
    widely through the incongruous hash of close croonings, free sax
    solos, and piercing strings of ""He's So Dumb"", which held out
    the promise of a melodic pop album composed entirely of
    mixed-and-matched wax. At this point, it's not even clear the
    vocals haven't also been lifted from some obscure vault, so the
    shoddy lyrics come off as intriguingly mediocre, although the
    illusion of foundness is shattered at lines like, ""He thinks
    that Axl Rose is pit crew deodorant.""</p><p>
    
    The next track, while disabusing me of the mix-and-match
    fantasy with a brilliant doo-wop groove that leans heavily on
    a tinny little synth pattern, held out some hope yet: at the
    bridge all sense of meter is lost for good, and as tracks are
    dropped back in without the slightest regard for synchronicity,
    it feels like someone is slowly rearranging the features of your
    best friend's face without telling you what the hell is going on.
    If Frank Zappa built a great monument to the idiocy of doo-wop,
    then with this song The Phenomenological Boys have inadvertently
    demolished it.</p><p>
    
    I wish I could go on like this. But I'm sorry to report that the
    rest of the album is as obnoxiously sloppy in songwriting as it
    is in musicianship and production, in a way that makes the
    promise of the first two songs seem like nothing but bitter
    lies. ""Visit to Venus"" really bursts the bubble, as the sense of
    an ever-unfolding plunderphonic adventure collapses in on the
    vapid powder-pop sensibility I'd been trying so hard to ignore.
    ""Yodeling in Heaven"" is a well-executed one-joker (""But before
    the day came he was swallowed in flames/ 'Twas a chemical spill
    out on I-94"") with the dinky glockenspiel, zippy slide guitar,
    and pitiful calliope to back up its puny little mock-pathos.
    At this point, the album this could have been is critically
    injured, if not quite on its deathbed.</p><p>
    
    The next track deals a blunt head wound, and two tracks later,
    no one in their right mind would even try to check for vital

    these sounds around me. One is a squeaky ceiling fan, which cries as it slowly rotates and rocks in the
    slow, humid air. The other is my Grandpa snoring symphonically through the thin wood panel walls, with such
    a frightful gale as to suck up his own nostrils. And outside the window are the distant cries of coyotes,
    yelping and yapping out on the shadows of the countryside.  Yet, somewhere between my ears there exists a
    spectacular balance to the proceedings, as my head draws and mixes them together into a satisfying musical
    whole. If I only had a microphone in which to save and later savor these sounds!</p><p>
    
    Apparently, Keith Fullerton Whitman feels a similarly procreant urge to capture these brief moments of life
    that seem to be outside of ordinary reality. In the Dartmouth Street tunnel that runs from Back Bay Station
    in Boston to Copley Plaza, a cavernous walkway lined with glass brick walls reflects the sounds of passengers
    and trains in such a way as to sound like music to his ears. We have utility doors banging, footsteps on a
    catwalk, some lost guitar reverberating down the walkways, the arrivals and departures of three trains, and
    all the percussive accompaniment of people running to make their transfers. As the piece moves on, an odd
    sound phenomenon begins to envelop the daily proceedings. About five minutes in, this mechanized drone of
    the trains disappearing down the tunnel coalesces into a heavy constant undertow of sound, swallowing up
    the guitar, passengers, and the approach of other trains, sustaining the snippet beyond its apparent
    qualities.</p><p>
    
    What separates this material from the field recordings on the old Folkways label is that the raw sound
    taped by Whitman is conversely used to create a new piece, almost a reflection of the original sounds which
    are now bent and refracted through his eyes and ears.  Whitman's response piece runs nearly the same length
    as the centerpiece, and is remixed in real time, combining these elements along with some of the life sounds from
    where he was doing the remixing, on his front porch.  Here, Whitman builds on the odd metallic train drone
    of the original with a harmonium-like resonance, washing everything out with a beautiful haze of generator
    buzz, becoming the thick air of the underpass itself, completely saturated in humid humming. He even lets
    the birds in the trees and the cars on the street make an appearance as the drone begins its gentle descent
    back into the everyday.</p><p>
    
    Those expecting sounds like those found on last year's polished <i>Playthroughs</i> won't find them here;
    the production on this outing has a much rougher aura.  Whereas each note of <i>Playthroughs</i> seemed
    almost like a singular pearl, <i>Dartmouth Street Underpass</i> provides a gritty ether that sticks to the
    skin, as dirty in its ambiance as the subway's platforms on a muggy day.  It's also important for newcomers
    to note that Whitman has experimented with this premise before, to more satisfying ends.  His CD-R releases
    <i>Car Passings at Night</i> and <i>Manchester-by-the-Sea</i> similarly manipulated the sounds of cars
    passing on wet roads and waves crashing on a beach.  Of these releases, <i>Manchester-by-the-Sea</i> remains
    the most compelling.  <i>Dartmouth</i> is closer to <i>Car Passings</i> in both subject and replayability--
    an interesting experiment that rewards listening, but rarely engages on a visceral level.</p></div>"|8660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8660-dartmouth-street-underpass/|7.3|Andy Beta

    in general, traditional folk music is described as ""of the people"" and representing universal experiences
    of pain, love and the otherwise mundane.  Yet folk music almost always seems tied to a particular time and
    place, often indelibly related to the person making it.  I hear Elizabeth Cotton's motherly, eternally
    optimistic plea, ""I don't wanna be treated this old way,"" and think of all the crap she must've gone through;
    I hear Leadbelly throw down lines like, ""Shot James Brady, gonna shoot him again,"" as if he'd killed a
    hundred men without a second thought.  Even Dylan spouting ""I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of
    a graveyard"" rings true with me.  In all of these cases, I'm struck by the universal sentiment, yet the
    songs are nonetheless distinctly individual.</p><p>
    In this way, folk music has always had an effect on me similar to free jazz, musique concrete or even noise:
    they all channel a desire to express what is generally considered inexpressible, though just as often, they
    represent the radically subjective.  When Dylan spouts, or Stockhausen splices primitive electronics with
    German radio broadcasts, there's a tangible divide between what would be absolute truth and complete
    alienation.  It's tough to stand on the fence with that music, even more so when it's decades removed from
    its birth.  Of course, folk, in all its forms, has endured, and if there really is a relationship between
    the music of Dylan and Stockhausen, it is that practically anyone is invited to join in (if not necessarily
    to hum the same tune).</p><p>
    Electronic and found-sound experimenters Alejandra Salinas and Aeron Bergman seem to be on a similar
    trajectory as the aforementioned musicians.  Taking elements of mundane existence from kitchen scatter to
    storefront hustle to parlor room piano, they cut and filter with laptop precision, arranging the sounds
    into an almost documentary narrative; their music is folk merely by proxy.  On three records prior to
    <i>Bousha Blue Blazes</i> (including the ethnomusical document <i>Folklore, Vol. 1: La Rioja</i>, source
    material for their <i>Ruinas Encantadas</i> disc), the Spain-based duo collected sounds familiar to almost
    anyone and manipulated them into music that, while culled from the mundane, was decidedly abstract.  Their
    latest release uses most of the same tactics, but rather than proceed as an experiment in sound, it feels
    to me like a labor of love and loss, one of considerable depth.  Simply put-- and despite my fear that it
    could fairly easily polarize listeners-- it's an incredibly beautiful set of music.</p><p>
    The story of <i>Bousha Blue Blazes</i> is that Bergman's grandmother Bousha visited his home in Spain during
    Christmas 2001, and that all sounds on this record are taken from that time.  After the very brief,
    laptop-manipulated guitar fanfare of ""\xC1nimo"", ""Humming Radio Caro Cariño"" sneaks in with distant violin
    and guitar pluck; soon enough, Bousha's passive, pleasant singing arrives, joining an old tune on the radio.
    Very quickly, the comfortable milieu of their living room is established, but it's just as quickly detoured
    by soft, high computer tones and a repetitive guitar figure.  The tones float alongside, but rarely
    interrupt the trio, as the piece glides in and out of focus.  ""Thanksgiving Going on Anyway"" begins on a
    stuttering, almost glitch pulse when all of a sudden, what sounds like a wine glass being shattered in the
    right channel introduces a muffled crowd of people, presumably sitting down to dinner.  The broken pulse
    recurs now and again, and sometimes sine beeps (and lots of other unidentified noises) punctuate the mix
    like glitter on a tapestry.  It's a very highly detailed music, but it doesn't overwhelm the senses-- in
    fact, like the best moments on this CD, it invites you to move closer.</p><p>
    Since many of the tracks feature vocals, they often resolve into semi-songs.  ""Amapola Dust"" features Bousha's
    refrain ""I love you"" over shimmering, sliced cymbals, vinyl crackle, and its own echo looped and considerably
    processed.  ""I Don't Know"" is actually a straight song performed by Bousha, and sounds unaltered.  Apparently,
    she had been a professional singer in the past, and although a few years removed from the stage may have
    taken strength from her voice, she's still graceful.  ""Know I Don't"" follows, and the title suggests it may
    have taken source material from the previous tune, though its construction is obviously laptop-generated.
    Two minutes in, the voices and piano drop out for a cavernous, bottomless trip into the black abyss.  Quiet
    but weighty ambience surrounds, and it almost feels as if I've plunged into the deepest regions of a northern
    river, unable to sense much but my own helplessness.  There is no sound but the still, consonant roar of the
    beyond; in music it's sometimes hard to tell exactly where I am, though this place seems close to birth, or
    perhaps death.</p><p>
    Of course, <i>Bousha Blue Blazes</i> is the kind of record that could inspire completely different impressions
    from someone else, or even myself at a different time.  Like the best folk, or any other purely expressionist
    form of music, it not only relies on the methods and particular point of view of the performers, but on the
    hope that someone will intercept its transmission, thereby magnifying the impact.  As I see it, Alejandra
    and Aeron's remarkable achievement is not only in the unique way they translate the warmth and wisdom of an
    otherwise completely unfamiliar woman and location, but in how they did it with such ingenuity.  Far from a
    private experience, music like this stays alive as long as it has an audience with which to connect.</p></div>"|103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/103-bousha-blue-blazes/|8.5|Dominique Leone

    drummers, nor am I bucking the trend by slagging his god-awful solo record.  <i>Two Sides of the Moon</i>,
    abandoned the brilliant potential of a prolonged ""Cobwebs and Strange"" propulsion or side-long extension
    of the violin ending he tacked onto ""Baba O'Riley"".  He didn't even take the drumsticks into his meaty
    hands, for Christ's sake, much less set up an explosive drum kit. All he did on that bastardized album
    was sing! And wretchedly at that.</p><p>
    
    Angus Maclise, on the other hand, was far more the Renaissance Man: making his own calendars, doing
    calligraphy, publishing homemade collections of his poems and spiritual tracts, and acting in underground
    flicks, not to mention founding the original incarnation of The Velvet Underground. To those already
    entranced by his late-blooming legacy (he passed away prematurely at age 41 back in the late 1970s with
    no readily available documentation of his efforts), he is remembered as a powerful percussionist. Whether
    in his hand-drumming duties sustaining The Dream Syndicate (featuring future minimal legends like La Monte
    Young, Marian Zazeela, Tony Conrad, and John Cale) or in the incessant rainfalls and thunderheads from the
    storms of Nirvana that he conjured up on the 39-minute mind expansion of ""Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda
    (St. Marks Epiphany)"" from the first Quakebasket archival unearthing, Maclise was one of the few original
    percussionists to come along in the last century, tapping into the ancient tradition that the drums could
    invoke and carrying it into the future.</p><p>
    
    As he puts it in the poem that opens up this third disc of old
    tapes to be compiled: ""You are not limited to one room, there are many rooms."" Which certainly is true,
    as this collection explores the numerous facets of his far-reaching capabilities. The music, however,
    suffers not so much from dilution or scattering of energies as much as it does from remembrance of the
    beatific strength of his drumming capabilities so rarely on display here.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Astral Collapse</i> Maclise concerns himself more with other possible disciplines: poetry recital,
    Gysin-esque tape collage, early synth meltdowns, and harmonium hums. ""Smothered Under Astral Collapse""
    offers an explanation of Tibetan rituals that he was pondering at the time, before engaging in an
    Innersystems-like mashing of babbling beardisms with odd tape splicing in the background. This leads into
    a harmonium-hover of sustained drone that is surprisingly light on its feet, nimbly waltzing on wavering
    overtones that build over seventeen minutes. It finds him to still be extremely sympathetic with other
    New York lofters of the early 70s like La Monte Young, Terry Riley, and Charlemagne Palestine, though
    he isn't as obsessively focused as these gents.</p><p>
    
    Only once, on ""Beezlebub"", does Maclise pull out the Beat bongos, and even then promptly chucks them into a
    haunted pressure cooker, making a most intense and unholy clatter of percussion and disquieting ghost noise.
    ""Cloud Watching"" is diffuse and calming, echoing and glistening with numerous gongs, bells, and strings.
    The tape quality of some of these restored pieces is less than ideal, but in the right setting, it reveals
    less the hi-fidelity flaws than the curious aura of tapes gooey with hash haze, transmitting by contact
    high.</p><p>
    
    The fifth track reveals a heavy Sun Ra presence, as he transubstantiates the Arp circuits into star plasma,
    firing intense tazer rounds into the headspace with some background clopping coming almost as an afterthought.
    ""Dracula"" begins as an excellent dose of tape collaging and tambour buzzes, as birds, location recordings,
    tape loops, and electronic noises blur into one messed-up entity, but the stoned poetry reading that comes
    to the fore and pushes back the psychedelic noise is more of a buzz-kill, a bummer that brings down the
    remainder of the trip. Maybe drummers should just stay away from singing.</p></div>"|5023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5023-astral-collapse/|6.7|Andy Beta

    consisting of fifty-five bowed guitars, ten full drumsets, and a guy hitting a cat with a frying pan, all
    engaged in a single belabored crescendo.  The musical vocabulary of instrumental rock seems to be largely
    oriented towards communal gestures, in both the grandiose swell of quasi-orchestral groups and the gratuitously
    irregular time signatures and binary melodic patterns of math-rock.</p><p>
    
    And then there are the Dirty Three.  The instrumental rock of violinist Warren Ellis, guitarist Mick Turner,
    and drummer Jim White has always held a determined gaze on melody and mood.  Each of the three players has
    a distinct style, and when they're on-- as they were on their past three album-- the results can be stunning.
    At their best, Ellis' melancholy violin set against the backdrop of White's skeletal percussion and Turner's
    hypnotic guitar evokes the painful sensory acumen of a man wandering desperately alone through the Outback's
    dustiest deserts.</p><p>
    
    Even as Ellis, Turner, and White expanded their sound significantly with 2000's unbearably gorgeous <i>Whatever
    You Love You Are</i>, their music benefited from a perfectly considered lack of excess.  Unfortunately,
    <i>She Has No Strings Apollo</i> sees the sharp and evocative sound of Dirty Three falling slightly out of
    focus.  Though all the elements that make their music great are still present, never do they crystallize
    and come together quite like they have in the past.  Suffice to say, the mood isn't nearly as powerful when
    the aforementioned desert becomes a lush forest, and the man stalking it comes well-prepared, with tourists
    in tow.</p><p>
<i>She Has No Strings Apollo</i> opens with ""Alice Wading"", a song that could be described as a beautiful
    set populated by subpar actors.  At about the three-minute mark, a repeated pizzicato pattern gives way to
    soaring bowed passages, just before White enters with one of the most steady, unchallenging rhythms on the
    album.  The structure of the song is certainly complex, but the segues between parts don't sound particularly
    elegant or organic.  By the time Ellis' violin is brought to the front of the mix for a few moments of
    gorgeous, strained melody, the song is already on the wane.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, a dearth of strong melody is perhaps the biggest complaint to be levied against this record.  Ellis'
    violin is multitracked to death throughout the record, and while the resulting richness is often welcome,
    the expressiveness of the clear, melodic lines that make so much of Ellis' work compelling is often lost in
    the mix.  On ""Long Way to Go with No Punch"", Ellis' playing is segmented by swells of piano, as Turner's
    guitar and White's drums are kept at a near-whisper.  On ""Rude (And Then Some Slight Return)"", that same
    whisper becomes a roar of violent noise, as Ellis' violin is swallowed up by distortion and Turner's guitar
    squeals in the foreground.</p><p>
    
    The apex of <i>She Has No Strings Apollo</i> comes with ""No Stranger Than That"", which re-enlists the
    structure of ""Alice Wading"" with much more compelling results.  Here, the multitracking of Ellis' violin is
    anything but a detriment, as Ellis weaves several soaring melodies around the gorgeous frame provided by
    Turner and White.  Rather than concealed, the full character and timbre of the violin is brought out, and
    the track is much, much stronger for it.</p><p>
    
    So even though it's host to a few spectacular moments, there's little to be found on <i>She Has No Strings
    Apollo</i> beyond any of the band's always lovely slabs of old-country post-rock.  While by no means a weak
    release, many of the most enjoyable moments on <i>She Has No Strings Apollo</i> reflect only minimally the
    band's unique strengths.  Instead, Dirty Three's singular emotional pull is sacrificed in favor of a more
    sonically grand, but ultimately less captivating sound-- proof that even an instrumental band can lose its
    voice.</p></div>"|2330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2330-she-has-no-strings-apollo/|6.9|Matt LeMay

    instruments well, or don't do enough with them...but whether complainers come around or not, one expectation everyone should have is for that record
    to push your boundaries or buttons in some way.  It should show you a new tactic, or a personal voice-- something to set it apart from
    everything you've heard before.</p><p>
    
    Even with such limited criterion, there are albums that just have <i>nothing</i> going on.  The biggest problem with Christmas Decorations' debut
    <i>Model 91</i> isn't that it's simple or limited, but that within their constricted style, they aren't doing anything new or illuminating.
    Steve Silverstein (aka Madam Estrella) and Nick Forte (of Rorschach and Beautiful Skin) play what could be described as primitive pop-electronica,
    made with low-tech gear and chincy-sounding digital sequencers.  You could as easily tag them as indie rock: they play guitar and bass, though they
    don't do much with their instruments.  Whatever you call it, the album fails on a basic level: it never engages the listener.</p><p>
    
    Christmas Decorations stick within a rigid sound world.  Most of the thirteen tracks are short instrumentals-- about three minutes apiece-- built on thin
    effects and beats; they layer ambient waves over the music in a disinterested, ""look what this effect does!"" fashion.  Each piece is basic and
    barebones, aiming for mood: some pieces loom like haunted dreams, but most are tainted by canned ""spooky"" guitar effects.  There's no
    hint as to what we're supposed to be haunted by, however, or what's so haunting <i>about</i> this music.  Without dynamics, there's no chance we'll
    find a particular passage any more or less affecting than another.</p><p>
    
    Vocal tracks fare better, presenting skittish avant pop with goofy arrangements and nonsense lyrics.  The best song, ""A Random Hill"", pits
    a British-accented lead and catchy harmonies over a melodica and samples; others, like ""Lowlands"" and ""Hen's Teeth"" suffer for their tedious
    attempts to wax sinister.  Between the amateur vocals and skewed, deconstructed songs, you can almost trace a line to Brian Eno's 70s ""pop"" records,
    but that's just another reminder: this was done far better decades ago, when people first started taking pop apart.  That those folks pushed the
    boundaries much farther <i>and</i> wrote better songs is further damnation for these young turks.</p><p>
    
    The biggest disappointment isn't that the record's so primitive, derivative or simple, just that it doesn't tell us anything about the artists or
    their goals.  We can hear the influences and the gear that they're playing around with, but we don't find out what sets Christmas Decorations apart
    from any other bedroom pop group.  These two guys are far from novices, but there are hundreds of demos out there with far more to say, and better.</p></div>"|1455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1455-model-91/|2.3|Chris Dahlen

    New-speak. So potent are these materials, merely perusing one paragraph red-lines the hype meter, which leads to our failing the weekly
    objectivity screening and the predetermined penalty: answering angry emails from Nine Inch Nails fans we dissed two years ago.</p><p>
    So before I even bother filling the cup, this is my admission of guilt: I read the press release for this Liaisons Dangereuses record, and I actually
    responded to the first line: ""this is probably the most highly anticipated electronic CD reissue of all times,"" mentally entering in the obvious 10.0
    it most certainly deserved. Whacked out of my skull on propaganda, I didn't even think for a second about what else could be considered a
    highly anticipated electronic reissue (Derrick May's debut full-length, an Arthur Russell singles collection-- even Stockhausen's <i>Hymnen</i> come
    to mind), nor did I even listen to <i>Liaisons Dangereuses</i> before buying in. I mean, if DJ Hell is spinning it, who am I to disagree?</p><p>
    While Hit Thing's tag line is ridiculous, there's plenty of aural evidence to place this mysterious artifact high on any historian's list, dating from
    a crucial juncture in the development of electronic music in Europe: the dawn of the eighties. ""Mystere dans le Brouillard"" has a heavy Eurotrash throb--
    fashioned by Chrislo Haas (ex-DAF) and Beate Bartel (ex-Mania D.)-- with thrusting French grunts from relatively unknown singer, Krishna Goineau. The
    synthesizers glisten like piss on broken wine bottles in a dark corridor of Le Mètro, alongside the roar of an oncoming train, approaching fast. The track
    that's most often spun on dancefloors, ""Los Niños del Parque"", squirms like Giorgio Moroder squeezing into some tight leather pants slathered with
    black tar heroin, dark and foreboding as the peculiar German-Spanish patois of Goineau mingles with feminine mewls and yelps.</p><p>
    At times, the group fuse together clashing musical fashions into surprisingly stylish cuts almost too incredible to believe. On ""Etre Assis ou
    Danser"", they sound like Damo Suzuki doing white lines, fronting Taco, injecting some street-meth, squawking sax into the track. Sometimes they
    echo similar work from their peers in Cabaret Voltaire, over on the British Isles. On a track like ""Aperitif de la Mort"", Liaisons Dangereuses are
    incredibly menacing, as they take the spoken word moments of the Cosmic Couriers and rub some of Neubaten's scrap metal along their unwashed armpits,
    as Goineau babbles like Alan Vega, slobbering wine through the streets of Paris.</p><p>
    ""Peut Etre-Pas"" could be next in line for the <i>Disco Not Disco</i> series, falling somewhere between classic Yello and lesser-knowns recently excavated
    from the early days of electro. The bass is rubbery, like one of Mister Fantastic's condoms, the vocals squalid and bizarre; you can see why this would
    lace the sets of Carl Craig, Derrick May, and the current crop of electroclash spinners.  Twenty years on, Liaisons Dangereuses' only album proves they
    were way ahead of their time and its hot fashion sense.</p></div>"|4762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4762-liaisons-dangereuses/|7.3|Andy Beta

Totally engrossed in Bleeker Bob's extensive metal section, we were blown away by a photograph of what looked like a     heavy-set Alice Cooper and his denim-obsessed friends, by songs titles like ""Hobbit Motherfuckers"" and ""I Got Erection"" (among others), and     finally by the over-sexed coming-of-age liner notes to <i>Ass Cobra</i>, by ""King Irwin"" The Whiskey Rebel. In the language of a     cracked-out Henry Miller (or Vince McMahon), this so-called rebel proclaimed that-- like Tristram Shandy-- he wouldn't have been born if his father hadn't     ""come"" in the right place, that his strapping adopted Norwegian parents had a lot of sex, and how when he first saw Turbonegro in Oregon they managed     to turn on an entire party of women (and men ""coming to grips with their feminine side"").  That this band of frumpy metal heads-- men that could almost     pull of black sweat suits-- were ""Norway's greatest band ever.""</p>
<p>That's certainly a lot of rock-n-roll potential, but we were bummed to see they'd prematurely stopped their attack in 1998 when vocalist Hank Von     Helvete went into intensive care at a psychiatric unit in Milan for an addiction to heroin and darkness.  Ever a fan of the modernist cult of     genius, this premature breakup only added to the flames of an already ferociously burning fire, a church torched in the name of death punk! So     yeah, we were hooked.</p>
<p>In their decade together, Turbonegro released at least two classic records: <i>Ass Cobra</i> (1996) and <i>Apocalypse Dudes</i> (1997),     both reissued by Epitaph in 2003. <i>Ass Cobra</i> is the more immediate and rougher of the two, with the brilliant ""Denim Demon""-- the best     teenage outcast anthem since Danzig left the Misfits-- and ""Prince of the Rodeo"", which combines piss-drunk L.A. thrash and a purer understanding     of the band that inspired it.  ""Prince of the Rodeo"" channels Van Halen's first two records in a straight, wailing hard rock anthem, a classic     piece of guitar showmanship precious few bands could hope to pull off. On <i>Apocalypse Dudes</i>, the addition of guitarist Euroboy and new drummer     Chris Summers yields a denser sound: check out the constant guitar tapping on ""Get It On"", and the ponderous, nearly Yes expansiveness of ""The Age     of Pamparious"".</p>
<p>The music isn't as heavy as I'd imagined; some friends and I watched the video for ""Get It On"" at work without any speakers, then decided     to take votes on what music could possibly live up to the ridiculous imagery, of Hank Von Helvete in full face paint brandishing a     cane-cum-riding-crop, the rest of the band decked out in sailor caps and red lipstick, driving nowhere in a car. Recalling a number of Guns 'n' Roses     videos, Slash perched on mountain tops or in solitary confines for his half-assed solos, guitarist Euroboy plays quickly and with skill, in     a stable. But we couldn't hear him. One of us said there would have to be electronic drums. I mentioned Roxy Music fronted by King Diamond. Someone     else mentioned The Stooges and Danzig. Oddly enough, they ended up sounding kind of like a better, three-dimensional version of The Hives, though Hives'     vocalist Pele Almqvist speaks elsewhere of watching and admiring Turbonegro when he was in high school, so I guess it's more proper to say The Hives are     a bad version of Turbonegro.</p>
<p>Though they've recorded for Man's Ruin, Sympathy for the Record Industry and Amphetamine Reptile, had a tribute album recorded in     their honor (<i>Alpha Motherfuckers</i>, Blitzcore; 2001), and despite increasingly loud championing by Rocket From The Crypt, Dave     Grohl, Jello Biafra, Metallica, Queens of the Stone Age (who cover ""Back to Dungaree High"") and the famously crotchety Steve Albini,     Turbonegro remain best known in the US for their back-story.  The decidedly 1970s East Village ""gay"" look-- bright red lipstick, Tom of     Finland's facial hair and denim suits amid images of male on male blowjobs-- whether satirical or not, is pretty daring when placed     in the context of our always uptight hard rock scene.</p>
<p>Basically, Turbonegro are heterosexual men obsessed with other men's asses. <i>Ass Cobra</i> is the most     overt in this regard: it's here that they sing about a ""tender"" sailor man, re-envision ""Midnight Rambler"" as ""Midnight NAMBLA"" (complete with children     making nervous sounds), and decorate the album with images by Tom of Finland and old German men servicing one another. The butt fetish continues on     <i>Apocalypse Dudes</i>, which has the Meatmen-like ""Rendezvous With Anus"".  The perpetually sweaty Von Helvete     often ends their sets by sticking a sparkler up his ass-- G.G. Allin watch out!-- so the question is, is this offensive, or are we talking grand     Swiftian satire? What makes Turbonegro such a beloved band of hard rockers is the fact that they're intelligent, something their American counterparts     have had a tougher time proving in recent years.</p>
<p>Turbonegro's painfully clichéd but stunningly executed rock-n-roll excess reminds me of when I saw The Ramones play to a packed City Gardens. I     was 16, and at first, nervous and intimidated by the male bodies crashing around the stage, but ultimately they unearthed exhilaration in this     smoky, stinking, kind of stupid space, so far outside my usual suburban home. Today, as a cynical 29-year-old who for the most part nods out at     the banality of live music, any band that can chip away at years of boredom and shift my head towards the nervous energy of that first punk     offering must be onto something worthwhile. It might be the best praise I can offer Turbonegro: these records make me absolutely giddy.</p></div>"|11851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11851-ass-cobra-apocalypse-dudes/|9.0|Brandon Stosuy

In terms of physical
    dimensions, the featherweight, Poindexter-glasses Øye looks more like a guy that would help you out with
    your calculus than the kind of person who would get people on the floor.  Work experience?  Øye made his
    name with the Norwegian duo Kings of Convenience, an outfit bookish enough to title an album <i>Quiet Is
    the New Loud</i> without gagging over their own preciousness.  They're not exactly Fischerspooner where
    image is concerned.</p><p>
    And yet, the Kings have already tipped their hand about their secret predilection for the electronic world,
    having released the remix album <i>Vs.</i> last year with work from the likes of Rökysopp and Four Tet.
    Now, Øye's decided to take the complete binary plunge-- he'll Garfunkel no more!  Collaborating with a slew
    of laptop jockeys from around the world on each artist's home turf, Øye's strung together an LP that's all
    about the disco.</p><p>
    For an album where each track is under new management from the one before it, <i>Unrest</i> remains remarkably
    consistent in tone and quality.  It helps that all of Øye's collaborators, no matter the pedigree, leave the
    avant-garde leanings at home for fairly straightforward electro-pop atmospheres wrapped rather conventionally
    around what I assume were pre-prepared verse/chorus/verse Øye originals.  Here, frontiersmen like Prefuse 73
    and Schneider TM prove themselves equally capable of applying their arsenal to a more direct sound (Schneider
    TM, in particular, have some previous experience from their 2002 album <i>Zoomer</i>) as they are to working
    in abstract territories.</p><p>
    However, the more immediately appealing songs are by artists already hip-deep in Italo-disco or house.
    Morgan Geist kicks off the proceedings with an understated, moody synth bonanza on ""Ghost Trains,"" then is
    narrowly outdone by the livelier hydraulic-hiss percussion and swoop-strings of his fellow Americans in
    electro band Soviet, who are not afraid to make ""Sheltered Life"" bounce beneath Øye's croon.  But like
    most things these days, Sweden takes the opening trio of tunes, representative Kompis shellacking ""Sudden
    Rush"" with a subtle lite-rock sheen and a perfect head-bob bassline.</p><p>
    Compared to these easy-swallow tablets, the more heady work of the marquee acts take a bit more time to sink
    in.  Prefuse 73's ""Every Party"" throws Øye onto a set of Scott Herren's trademark Nordictrack-glide beats
    to make the song stand out from the tighter house beats of its neighbors, but also never reaches the peaks
    of the more trad-club jams.  Schneider TM, on the other hand, brings the affair to a new level without
    sacrificing the song format, irregular drums and sudden clumps of notes still coming together to
    appropriately swoon under the ""my baby"" romantic choruses of ""Like Gold"".</p><p>
    But let's not commit the sin of forgetting young Mr. Øye just because it's annoying to keep inserting that
    ""Ø"" symbol-- he's playing conductor through all this jazz, and he does it skillfully.  Whereas his decidedly
    non-dramatic voice might sound like a limitation in this kind of setting on paper, his cool delivery is run
    through with just enough melody to be more hummable (see: ""The Talk"") than the ironic detachment that
    sometimes brings down this genre.  Quietly assured, he recalls no one so much as the Notwist's Markus Acher,
    another fish-out-of-water finding a new home amongst the whirring machines.</p><p>
    Thus, despite sagging a bit in the middle, <i>Unrest</i> skillfully skirts the myriad ways this kind of
    variety project could go wrong.  The main failing I'd peg is a disappointing tendency to be overly
    retro-based, all too focused on Stevie Wonder keyboards and the days of asymmetric hair.  With indie rock
    and dance music showing indications that they might be merging onto the same highway somewhere in the near
    future, it's time to tone down the recycling and start applying the innovations of IDM to this ungodly, and
    possibly thrilling, hybrid.  While only Schneider TM seems fully up to that promise on <i>Unrest</i>, it
    still stands by Enon and The Postal Service as another important signpost on the way to new pixilated
    horizons.  Forward things push let's!</p></div>"|6078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6078-unrest/|7.9|Rob Mitchum

Don't get me wrong, these are all brand new songs, but I've been imagining this album, playing
    different versions of it in my head for a long time.""  Rhett Miller's awfully talkative (and refreshingly down-to-Earth) about his new solo
    album-- technically his second, after <i>Mythologies</i>, a disc of his early, folky recordings-- but I think it's that quote right there that
    sums up what you can expect from this record.  There's a studied, careful feel to <i>The Instigator</i>, a feel that seems to coat about eighty percent
    of solo records by bandleaders; it's hard to put into words, but easy to hear.</p><p>
    
    It could have something to do with the lack of a group dynamic that comes with the territory-- when he's playing with the Old 97's, Miller and the band
    tend to let themselves come unhinged more often, as the experience of playing together all the time allows for a certain individual freedom within
    the group.  Their ""Time Bomb"" is one of the most electrifying singles ever to have the label ""No Depression"" slapped on it, and it's largely because
    you can feel them letting go of the reins and going for broke.  Even with certified monsters like Jim Keltner in your backing band, it's hard to
    recreate that kind of energy on sessions with a pieced-together ensemble.</p><p>
    
    To wit, the album's opener is a fantastic song, but you can't help thinking that in the hands of the Old 97's it would have been just a little more
    commanding.  Miller wrote ""Our Love"" after reading the collected love letters of two historical figures to their respective, married lovers: Richard
    Wagner and Franz Kafka.  The subject matter is unexpectedly successful and universal, and his quips about Wagner ""working on a thing that when he
    finished took almost seven hours to sing"" are clever enough to elicit a pretty broad grin, but the music backing it is standard-issue rock-country,
    in that order.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""This Is What I Do"" manages to put some power in its pop, largely on account of Miller's excellent melody and producer John Brion's (Aimee
    Mann, Elliot Smith) neatly harmonized guitar parts.  The album hits a pretty good stride in the middle, where we find Miller consciously trying
    playing up his pop leaning:  ""Come Around"" has a chorus titanic enough to stay afloat after any kind of collision, while ""Things That Disappear""
    offers ""bah bah"" backing vocals and radio-friendly production.</p><p>
    
    The two best songs hit right in a row, the excellent ""Point Shirley""-- featuring Robyn Hitchcock on backing vocals and guitar-- leading
    the way.  In addition to Hitchcock's characteristic jangle, the song has an undeniable rhythmic sway and lopsided delivery that put its head and
    shoulders a few inches above everything else on the album; ""Four-Eyed Girl"", a delicious little slice of geeky romance full of rhythmic
    piano and drifting guitar hooks, leans further toward the center of the dial, sure to fix your Marshall Crenshaw jones.</p><p>
    
    The sun-drenched pop of ""Hover"" and the rockabilly of ""the El"" (as in Chicago's ""El"" trains) keep things riding high, but the album suffers a curious
    collapse moving into its final quarter, with three limp songs in a row.  ""Your Nervous Heart"" practically lets you hear the drummer snoring as he creeps
    along with a lugubrious beat, and even Miller's reliable pen doesn't seem quite up to the task.  ""I Want to Live"" is the hardest-rocking
    thing here, but it wound up with the worst hook in the bunch; ""Terrible Vision"" closes things out with a strange coda, but nevertheless
    unsatisfying and unsettled.</p><p>
    
    Miller offers more than enough quality material here to justify stepping out on his own: what he's  occasionally lacking in energy, he largely
    makes up for with craft, and Brion is smart enough to put the emphasis on Miller's writing with his  crystal clear production.  That said, it's
    unlikely to instigate much beyond some afternoon head-nodding, and even some of Miller's fans will be somewhat put off by the album's borderline
    MOR sound.  <i>The Instigator</i> is a fun diversion, but I'm looking forward to seeing Miller back in his natural habitat: the Old 97's.</p></div>"|5290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5290-the-instigator/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    Down"". The former, an endlessly endearing Who-styled garage send-up is first rate, sing-along rock and roll, performed with the kind of fervor that will
    have you unwittingly air drumming on your lap before you know it. The latter is a conversely sedate, street poet acoustic jam, set to a remarkable,
    insightful set of Dylan musings. Together they form an obvious microcosm of <i>The Inhuman Condition</i>, a hugely promising debut EP from Montreal's
    clearly uninhibited Sam Robert.  This suave twenty-six year-old singer/songwriter has enjoyed surprise success on Canadian radio with both of the
    aforementioned cuts, and might soon be treading water in his own hype.</p><p>
    
    For the time being, though, <i>The Inhuman Condition</i> remains an unusually assured first outing, one that-- while far from being another <i>Odelay</i>--
    paints the picture of a young artist adamantly refusing to be pigeonholed. The bases covered in a mere twenty three minutes are impressive; whether it
    be mixing the aggression of ""Don't Walk Away Eileen"" with a touch of rockabilly on ""When Everything Was Alright"", or adding an almost psychedelic
    climax to ""Where Have All the Good People Gone?"", Roberts-- even at this early stage of the game-- has his mind all over the map, giving him a wealth
    of options for the future. Perhaps the best part of <i>The Inhuman Condition</i> is the level of cohesion it manages despite its diversity; Roberts
    has developed his music enough to give it an identity, which will certainly be his greatest asset when it comes time to record a debut full length.</p><p>
    
    Well short of perfect, <i>The Inhuman Condition</i> loses steam on its last two songs: the droning chant ""My Love is Freeing"", while it features a
    soothing overdubbed vocal, gets a little tedious, and the country-Stones closer ""This is How I Live"" is far too tongue-in-cheek to be taken
    seriously. Fruitless, learning forays like this will no doubt wind up shelved if Universal opts to record a full-fledged major label debut based on his
    recent North-of-American attention.</p><p>
    
    As it stands, Roberts says enough in the six songs here, but leaves countless avenues to expand his already broad range of sound. A follow-up with a
    little more cohesion and consistency would be nice, but <i>The Inhuman Condition</i> is nevertheless a sturdy, respectable and, intermittently, even
    thrilling first effort from an artist who has much to say, and the exceptional talent to say it in such a short length of time.</p></div>"|6803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6803-the-inhuman-condition-ep/|7.9|Matthew Stephens

The unstable, minor-key discomfort of <i>Ghost Tropic</i>
    is long gone, and for the first time, Will Oldham comparisons will be shelved by critics in favor of, god
    forbid, Bob Seger.  The wailing, desperate spirits that plagued Jason Molina through his earlier albums
    have been banished, mostly; others have come to help him light candles against the darkness, and now
    ""something's got to change.""  So he's left the quiet sorrow of <i>Didn't It Rain</i> sucking the diesel
    fumes of 70s roots-rock by the shoulder of a lonely stretch of highway, consciously emulating his ancestors
    in a long line of working-class heroes.  No matter what you might think of Seger (and pretty much anything
    would be justified), or the earthy bombast of the time, such simple honesty as Molina's is always in style,
    and the results are rarely less than excellent.</p><p>
    It may simply be the natural progression from the slightly fuller sound of <i>Didn't It Rain</i>, but the
    overt desire to move on preoccupies Molina.  If the last album was a lamentation on finding home in Chicago
    and the sheer inertia of blue-collar hand-to-mouth, then <i>Magnolia Electric Co.</i> is about finding the
    strength to move, to grow, and to leave it all behind.  ""While you've been busy crying about my past
    mistakes/ I've been busy tryin' to make a change/ And now I've made a change,"" is Molina's righteous cry
    in the early moments of ""I've Been Riding with the Ghost""; it's this bittersweet sentiment that forms the
    lingering heart of this album.  But then, with the unearthly call of steel pedal strings and the line,
    ""See, I ain't gettin' better/ I'm only gettin' behind,"" the motivation for this need to pick up stakes
    becomes evident.  It's beyond just a noble determination not to succumb to the stagnation of poverty or
    routine, and when the first hints of an underlying fear crack the façade, the effect transcends the
    allegorical simplicity of gallant idealism to something far more moving, something almost indescribably
    human.</p><p>
    These themes are echoed even more poignantly on the title-says-it-all opener ""Farewell Transmission"",
    perhaps the most powerful Songs: Ohia tune yet: ""I will try/ No one ever really tries/ I will be gone/
    But not forever.""  This stirring mix of melancholy and hope which Molina consistently finds in his lyrics
    is swelled to epic levels by the driving alt-country pride and a painfully plaintive refrain.  Molina's
    fixation on the symbolic romanticism of the moon and the darkness might be predictable, but it continues
    to impress as he segues from heartaching confessional to oblique metaphor in a single breath.</p><p>
    When <i>Magnolia Electric Co.</i> hits its stride in tracks like these, and others like ""Almost Was Good
    Enough"", it soars over Molina's previous work, but it's not an unqualified success.  First, although the
    rotating lineup of Songs: Ohia players recasts familiar faces Jennie Benford as Backing Vocal #1 and the
    <i>Mi Sei Apparso Come un Fantasma</i> musicians as The Band, Molina's brought along Lawrence Peters and
    Scout Niblett as Guest Vocalists #1 and #2, respectively, and he turns the reins over to them on ""The Old
    Black Hen"" and ""Peoria Lunch Box"", to decidedly mixed results.  Neither singer seems to connect with the
    written material, leading to slightly flattened deliveries of what might otherwise have been breathtaking
    in Molina's broken drawl.</p><p>
    Niblett does all right for herself, still managing to infuse ""Lunch Box"" with a sort of haunting (if
    off-key) resignation, but Peters is more problematic.  His fatherly, Haggard croon is a little more upbeat
    than the subject matter, and he sounds an awful lot like someone who should be saving his tears in the beer
    bottles he keeps in the back of his burnt-out pickup (with his dog) while he drives down dusty country
    roads, and the thunder rolls, and the lightning...  whatever.  Depending on one's tolerance for that
    hardcore country-soaked vibe, he's either extremely impressive or just awful.  But either way, he's not
    Molina, whose voice you bought this disc to hear.</p><p>
    Aside from that, the music doesn't always support the strength of Molina's words, especially in the
    gratuitously stormy ""John Henry Split My Heart"", but that's less a shot at the compositions than a
    testament to the wrenching sincerity of the lyrics.  It takes a colossal effort to back Molina's candor,
    and given what a departure this record is for the band, it's not surprising that some of the songs get
    bogged down here and there.  It's also not much of a problem; in the end, the more obviously misguided
    moments will be long forgotten, left in the roadside dust.  <i>Magnolia Electric Co.</i> is the sound of
    change.  It may be uncertain whether this is the journey of a man moving towards what he wants to become,
    or away from what he has been, but it's a great ride regardless.</p></div>"|7333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7333-magnolia-electric-co/|8.2|Eric Carr

Consequently, I find myself largely unable to
    decipher his liner notes to <i>Fast Asleep</i>, a fact which would normally cause me some degree of distress,
    owing to my megalomaniacal desire to know everything at all times.  That, however, is the true beauty of
    James Bradell's fourth release as Funki Porcini; it makes me <i>not</i> want to learn Italian.  In fact,
    over the album's duration and some time thereafter, I don't feel the need to pick up any of the Romance
    languages, or do much of anything else for that matter.  Instead, for a few brief moments, simply sitting
    and listening seems pretty great all by itself.</p><p>
    
    Bradell, in his own subtly inimitable fashion, has created here an exceptionally personal album, though not
    in a particularly ""revelatory"" sense.  Rather, this is an album most easily enjoyed in quiet solitude, as
    an entity all its own.  Since becoming one of the original South London Ninja masters in 1995, Bradell's
    take on classic ambient downbeat has fallen in step with that of labelmates Amon Tobin and Coldcut, but
    now the emphasis is sharply on ""ambient.""  Heavily treated vocal samples are the sounds of the outside
    world slipping away, or trying in vain to intrude into this almost accidentally cool dream state.  There's
    still a fair share of jazz-infused breaks hiding out in the sweetly atonal fog, but they never arrive
    without warning or stay long enough to get the blood up; the last thing Bradell wants to do is quicken a
    pulse.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, <i>Fast Asleep</i> isn't nearly as soporific as the title would imply, creating the sensation
    of a restful state somewhere in the nebulous territory between sleep and wakefulness.  Even though his loungy
    breakbeats have been relaxed, the trip-hop technician that produced the genre marker <i>Hed Phone Sex</i>
    hasn't disappeared.  Now song structures drift in and out like afterthoughts or mild hallucinations,
    dissolving back to component particles rather than merely concluding.  It's actually difficult not to feel
    very slightly disappointed when the more impressive compositions, from the slithering, Tobin-esque vibe of
    ""50,000 Ft. Freefall"" to the crystalline breaks of ""Weow"", simply disappear into the ambiance, or are
    resculpted into the next track.  The continuous morphing from point to point doesn't allow real closure,
    but still reinforces the flow of the album as a single, massive arrangement, which is the whole idea anyway.</p><p>
    
    A few of these tunes are fully realized animals, though, like the astonishing centerpiece, ""The Great
    Drive-By"", which throws some question on the effectiveness of this album-centric release.  Deep, dark
    currents of near-tuneless noise are instant reminders of a Boards of Canada arrangement along the lines
    of ""Everything You Do Is a Balloon"" or ""The Beach at Redpoint"", right down to the slow-motion breakbeat.
    Alternately uplifting and unnerving, ""Drive-By"" is a brilliant testament to what Bradell can do when he
    focuses on crafting a single track (instead of an entire album) from start to finish.  Like every other
    song on <i>Fast Asleep</i>, it's slick and evocative, but, unlike many of the others, it's also more
    capable of supporting itself while bolstering the album as a whole.  So, is it really necessary that an
    impressive monument to relaxation like this also be comprised of impressive individual songs, even when
    it works so well as a unit?  Well, no, but if the excellence of ""Drive-By"" is any indication, it couldn't
    hurt.</p></div>"|3248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3248-fast-asleep/|7.7|Eric Carr

    influential bands in rock history, he found himself a penniless, strung-out wreck, with a career suddenly
    and seriously on the wane.  To make matters worse, his self-titled solo debut, released earlier that year,
    was a monumental flop, a hastily thrown together collection of second rate re-recordings of Velvet
    Underground outtakes that lacked the intensity and focus of his earlier music.  Reed was at a crossroads,
    unsure of which direction to take his newfound independence.</p><p>
    At the same time, a new trend was emerging across the pond.  Glam rock began to flower in 1971, and by the
    following year had swept up countless British kids, turning them from restless, discontended youths to
    consummate, androgynous hipsters decked out in platforms, sequins and imposing hair.  It was the first
    mainstream rock movement to openly acknowledge the Velvets' influence, and in Marc Bolan, Ian Hunter and
    Bryan Ferry, Reed began to see his protégés: the coarse, primal rock 'n' roll he pioneered had found its
    audience.</p><p>
    One of his progeny, a young David Bowie, was hot off the success of his chart-topping <i>The Rise and
    Fall of Ziggy Stardust</i>, and was perhaps the most vociferous in his love of the Velvets and the
    incalculable influence they'd had on his music.  When given the chance, Bowie and guitarist Mick Ronson
    offered to produce Reed's solo follow-up: what followed was undeniably one of both glam rock's and Reed's
    finest moments, one that gave him a left-field radio hit and a blueprint for much of his solo work to
    follow.</p><p>
    Thirty years on, <i>Transformer</i> still sounds startlingly fresh, free from many of the clichés that
    taint other similarly minded records of the period. It also works as an interesting diversion from
    most of VU's work: where they clearly had a full-band aesthetic, and often leaned toward the avant-garde,
    <i>Transformer</i> took the strong pop undercurrent that ran throughout their records and indulged.  It's
    still fascinating to hear Reed outside the messy underproduction of the Velvets, yet even with Bowie and
    Ronson broadening the arrangements, <i>Transformer</i> feels remarkably natural.  Their production work
    was so loaded that, were it not for the incredibly focused songs beneath, it might have been overbearing.
    But with a solid base, the ornate arrangements help bring these songs to life, lending Reed's music a
    broader palette.  Lou himself, by contrast, sounds as intimate as ever on the record's more sedate tracks,
    crooning in a sensitive lilt that maintains his blissful, effortless cool.</p><p>
<i>Transformer</i> kicks off with the aptly titled ""Vicious"", a stiff, snot-nosed Godzilla of a rock
    song, decked out in leather and eye shadow, and drenched in the kind of punchy power chords intimately
    familiar to anyone owning VU's odds-and-sods compilations. Its gleefully tongue-in-cheek lyrics are among
    the album's highlights, with Reed's impetuous condescension beating down his subject's ego: ""When I see you
    walking down the street/ I step on your hands and I mangle your feet/ You're not the kind of person that I
    even want to meet.""</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""Perfect Day"" earns the distinction of being among the least characteristic songs Reed ever
    wrote; while its power ballad production and melody are enjoyable on their own terms, the song feels trapped
    under his dry vocal delivery, and falls somewhat flat as a result. ""Satellite of Love"" is still the bizarrely
    affecting centerpiece, serving as a poignant reminder of Reed's underrated gift for melody, which often eclipsed
    the signature, visceral abrasiveness he's more often recognized for. And of course, there's ""Walk on the Wild
    Side"", the classic tale of NYC gender-bending that garnered Reed the only real commercial airplay of his career.</p><p>
    This new edition adds acoustic demos of ""Hangin' Round"" and ""Perfect Day"", the latter notable for a newfound
    emotional push in its minimalism.  The remastering is nicely executed, clarifying the sound without
    bastardizing the occasionally dated production. This, along with the incredibly thorough liner notes and
    beautiful packaging make the reissue worthwhile for those who already own the record, and a must for
    first-timers just delving into Reed's solo work.</p></div>"|6731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6731-transformer/|8.4|Matthew Stephens

Nice, thanks; I'll get to <i>The New Folk Implosion</i>
    in a moment.</p><p>
    
    Alright, Mr. Barlow, I think we're alone now.  So, I'm just speaking for myself here, but do you know what
    I liked best about your work with Sebadoh, way back before you started Folk Imploding on the side?   I'm not
    talking about Gaffney's or Lowenstein's noise work-- just your stuff.  It wasn't the sleepy bedroom hiss,
    and it wasn't any of the plaintive sad-pop gems you turned out; it was the obvious sincerity, the desire
    behind the music.  Fuck analog-- you could've recorded <i>III</i> and <i>Bakesale</i> with an abacus and
    the only thing that would've still come through would have been the fact that you were making music for you,
    and no one else.  Why did that have to change?</p><p>
    
    There's a guy, used to hang around with The Residents, by the name of N. Senada; maybe you've heard of him.
    Even though it was probably just another one of those Residents gimmicks, he came up with this ""Theory of
    Obscurity""; an artist does his or her best work when they never expect anyone else to experience it-- in
    other words, when they aren't working for an audience.  Lou, you are the living, breathing proof of this
    theory, and I just can't help but think you've been looking for another ""Natural One"" since 1997, something
    else to fill the gap where radioland success used to reside, and everything has suffered for it.  It's like
    all of a sudden you realized that we've been listening in on you.  I mean, big deal, what industry seer
    could have foretold the success of that slowest of slow-burners, that slinky, understated temptation?  More
    importantly, who cares?  So you won the hearts of thousands for a while; so Interscope picked you up just
    long enough to drop you after <i>One Part Lullaby</i> failed to deliver a hit single.  Like you're a Musician
    now?  The capital M only leads to trouble, m'man; the music should be an end all its own.</p><p>
    
    If I may be so bold, fuck <i>us</i>.  We suck; all audiences do is stab you in the back the minute you let
    them down.  It's always the same with us-- ""What have you done for me lately?""  In the end, the only thing
    we, the eminently fickle public, love more than building up heroes is tearing them back down.  Who needs that?
    Leave stardom to soulless automatons like Justin Timberlake and mass iMedia crossover icon DMX; you're a
    human boy.  As I understand it, being dismissed from Interscope took quite a toll, but you should just be
    glad that you got out with life and limb intact.  As for the latest, <i>The New Folk Implosion</i>, you may
    <i>say</i>, ""I'm doing this for myself.  It's an expression of something I did with my friends,"" but-- I
    know the work you've done for yourself.  I know it well.  And this record was made with an audience in mind.
    So, if you're out there, Mr. Barlow, you don't need us, never did; you were doing great on your own.</p><p>
    
    All right, c'mon back in the room.  The issue (<i>finally</i>, I know) at hand is <i>The New Folk Implosion</i>.
    Some things have changed since last we left our players at the unimpressive end of <i>Lullaby</i>; John Davis
    called it quits back in '01, and Lou lined up guitarist Imaad Wasif and even convinced drummer Russ Pollard
    (of Sebadoh lore) to put in an appearance.  Gone with Davis are most of the trip-hop trappings, leaving the
    band to revert to something akin to the morose, jangly, guitar-driven roots of, yes, Sebadoh.  The 'Scope
    wasn't buying the new sound, as you know, and so the wayward trio found a new home at iMusic.  To recap:
    new label, new lineup, new sound; hence, <i>The New Folk Implosion</i>.</p><p>
    
    The one thing that hasn't changed, unfortunately, is the quest for acceptance.  A seemingly reactionary
    statement to the failure of the more exotic, and far better, <i>Lullaby</i>, the band's new sound is nothing
    short of painfully, achingly banal.  It goes to ridiculous lengths to avoid the risk of turning anyone away,
    and in doing so, becomes so unassuming-- so innocuous it might as well be invisible.  Everything here is
    half-realized; the uniform tempos and quaint melodies are easily forgotten.  Occasionally, <i>The New Folk
    Implosion</i> flirts with sensitive grunge ballads (""Coral"", ""Brand New Skin"") and awkward, shambling
    alt-rockers (""Fuse"", replete with Neil Young-inspired guitars blazing), but it never pans out-- the rock
    dynamics the band attempts to explore just don't mesh with Barlow's strengths as a songwriter.</p><p>
    
    The only time the album really comes into its own-- and this should surprise no one-- is when the mainstream
    rock posturing comes down to reveal the quieter moments of the record.  ""Pearl"" is exactly what the name
    implies: a simple, beautiful acoustic gem in the rough, entirely displaced among the power chords and
    middling hooks that dominate the rest of the album.  It's a sunset over the love of two people soon to be
    very far apart for a very long time, accompanied by a delicate, loping refrain and a few moments of sparkling
    piano; easily one of the most sensitive tunes Lou's ever penned.  Aside from that brief reprieve, the only
    other really redeeming track is ""Easy"", a soft-spoken tune that merely serves to remind listeners how naturally
    these melancholy, personal ruminations come to Barlow, and implicitly, how unnatural the rest of the album
    is in contrast.</p><p>
<i>The New Folk Implosion</i> closes out with, thankfully, a little bit of dignity, hearkening back to the
    laidback wonder of mid-period Sebadoh, though it still flinches from the comparison, begging the unpleasant
    question of why there isn't more of the old magic.  Well, as Lou sings on ""Easy"", in perhaps the most telling
    moment of this record, ""What I thought was fun isn't fun anymore.""  But then, working for the satisfaction
    of others before oneself rarely is.</p></div>"|3140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3140-the-new-folk-implosion/|4.6|Eric Carr

    the loss of their queen in a sorrowful choir of triangle waves, chivalrous joysticks court a fair Apple IIc
    with baroque blorps and bleeps; early Nintendo cartridges mount and prepare for righteous, quantized battle
    against Sega's Master System armada.  Why does it all seem so damn congruous?</p><p>
    Young Oliver Cobol and Sir Fashion Flesh hadn't met face-to-face until a week before they took <i>Shakestation</i>
    on tour.  Introduced by a common collaborator (American Patchwork founder Momus, whose fake-folk irony is
    fully evident on this effort), the duo produced their album by swapping files and instant messaging.  First,
    they get inside each song and play it like a video game, yielding a shimmering once-through complete with a
    silly perc track.  Then, with a long and wacky remix, the same song is ripped to pieces.  If the straight
    take is a game level as it's meant to be played, then its remix is that same level played by your palsied
    kid brother on a melted cartridge with an erratic power supply.  Its pristine veneer is subjected to a
    series of cruel cuts and modulations, wild loops and inversions, and sometimes an outright invasion of
    foreign tones or samples.</p><p>
    This is like constructing a dollhouse by hand in order to experiment on it with your own private arsenal of
    natural disasters-- a ridiculous enterprise, but potentially a revealing one.  Put another way, when Barney
    the Purple Dinosaur goes through the wood chipper, you see not only scraps of his costume, but slices of
    the man inside.  Likewise, in destroying the total artifice of these straitjacketed renditions, the remixes
    sometimes bring out a lilting, modern feel that the straight versions had concealed.  For instance, the
    remix of ""Gagliardia Venezia"" takes a bland instrumental piece and vice-grips it in a giant George Foreman
    Grill of the mind.  The result smothers you with analog resonance, spatters digital clip all over you, and
    melts in your skull, not in your ears.</p><p>
    Make no mistake, inhabiting the sound world of <i>Shakestation</i> for a whole 75 minutes is a truly grating
    experience.  I understand that limited range, uniform tone colors, and plastic beats are all part of the
    game, but the childish, almost autistic glee that makes the whole project so pleasurable is also its biggest
    flaw.  This music seems to truly ignore the human life on the receiving end, and forces you to approach it
    on Nintendo terms: Space is preplanned and one-directional, time is exact and exacting-- except you have no
    character to control.  Like watching someone play video games, it only stays fun if you're high.</p><p>
    Though their website claims they're gallant time-travelers currently residing in Elizabethan England, it's
    clear that the Brothers' first priority is to plunder the great machines of the recent past.  In other
    words, they're looking for obsolete songs to hang their cool video games sounds on.  But why Renaissance
    music?  Well, that's an open question.  Certainly not because they're trying to understand it on its own
    terms-- that's clear from the stilted phrasing and the almost total absence of polyphony.  When it comes
    to tone color, there's a certain match: A melody written to exploit the nasal timbre of a sackbutt or
    krumhorn sounds pretty good on a square wave.  Or maybe the Brothers understand that early music evolved
    as an elite hobby, just like video games, and are trying to exploit this parallel.</p><p>
    Nah.  Could it be that their self-imposed technical limitations give them a sense of solidarity with the
    Renaissance composers they cover?  Without access to the brute force or layered textures of a symphony
    orchestra, these composers had to make do with a musical language that worked for small groups of strings
    and voices, so they interwove melodies to create a fantastic sense of line and motion.  Likewise, video
    games haven't always come with their own box set soundtracks.  Early Ataris had no background music
    whatsoever (they barely had sound effects!) and Nintendo composers had very strict memory requirements to
    meet.  These technical restrictions actually made for some great work, which is easy to forget when you
    hear the latest techno remix of <i>Tetris</i>, or the latest philharmonic recording of Vivaldi, for that
    matter.  But <i>Shakestation</i> succeeds when it sticks to an old rap axiom, which states that the
    classics shouldn't be revived as naïve covers or dancefloor soup-ups, but mercilessly mined, twisted,
    and mixed together again.</p></div>"|7612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7612-shakestation/|7.1|Jascha Hoffman

    with ""Beds and Lawns,"" a CCR screamer that drifts around a four-second, ozone-piercing guitar screech,
    evoking endless southern pastures and balls-to-the-wall guitar rock.  But sustaining such beauty
    is a mug's game reserved for the effortlessly genius, and Sorry About Dresden, no matter how adept
    they may be at strumming and pounding their instruments, fall victim to gravity immediately after coming
    down for this promising high.</p><p>
    
    What makes ""Beds and Lawns"" most successful is its bridge, a melody that I swear shows up in close to one-half of the
    heartbreak new wave I heard as a kid. Something along the lines of stopping the world and melting with a
    person you really, really like. Sorry About Dresden are hardly new wave, which makes that mental
    connection all the more striking; in a way, they represent a kind of rock pastiche, in which the sources
    are plentiful and beg to be identified, but are tweaked enough from their original contexts that each
    remains too difficult to properly label and file away.</p><p>
    
    Still, my first inclination while listening to <i>Let It Rest</i> was to adapt myself to the task of some
    musical archivist, to properly identity the objects and carry them back to my writer's nest.  And I'll
    say this: Wracking my brain for the names of a million blurred faces I saw open for Superchunk ten years
    ago, this was the one time I envied overtanned Sugar Ray vocalist Mark McGrath, because apparently, he
    kills at <i>Rock-n-Roll Jeopardy</i>.  I eventually came to realize three things: there are moments
    that remind me vaguely of The Psychedelic Furs; some choruses join the hundreds of drunken refrains
    stolen from The Replacements; and singer Matt Oberst's vocal pacing, on occasion,
    reeks of Elvis Costello with post-nasal drip.  Oberst's voice has a youthful gruffness, like
    a teenager who smokes too much: not quite world-weary, but scratchy and maligned enough to convey emotions
    beyond his years.</p><p>
    
    Let me relate a quick analogy: The other day I was walking down East 61st in midtown Manhattan,
    during a very icy snowstorm, when I heard a bird singing in a bald tree.  I stopped and looked for it,
    trying to establish a defining characteristic within the otherwise monotonous white landscape: a tiny, distinct fragment
    deserving my attention.  There's nothing on <i>Let It Rest</i> so inviting, and I find that surprising for a
    band that's been around a few years and earned a slot on a small but well-known independent label.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised by SAD's mediocrity, or the begging acronym their name makes for.  With such a renown brother,
    we know Matt Oberst didn't have a long road to hoe, but looking at Mike Kinsella's Owen and American Football material, you can't
    let that slide.  Sorry About Dresden are a weak opening act in a circuit filled with superior headliners, a band
    lacking any distinguishing characteristics in the oversaturated world of mid-tempo anglophile pop.</p></div>"|7359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7359-let-it-rest/|5.0|Brandon Stosuy

    improvisation on KPFK. For most listeners, it was the funniest thing that had ever happened to them. The
    comedy of Radio Free Oz didn't flow like a river; it evolved like a living organism, spinning off random
    bits and pieces but always keeping its own bizarre, internal coherence. When the first of many albums the
    group recorded as The Firesign Theatre came out in 1968, new records were set for sustained stoned giggling
    worldwide. But even before smoking all that grass, it was almost impossible to describe their appeal.</p><p>
    Which is not to say they were without influences. Their freeform montage format drew heavily on pre-war
    radio drama and the emerging late-nite UHF spectrum. Their bits were built around ordinary things like
    RVs, game shows, channel surfing and fried chicken. And they were full of a kind of cock-eyed mock-patriotism
    that allowed them to take cheap shots on their favorite malignant superpower without really making any
    serious political statement. Hearing their lengthy streams of altered consciousness was like watching the
    Marx brothers do a James Joyce impression; in a lot of ways, they prepared the world for Monty Python.
    And their stuffed-shirt straight men were always really, really straight, which was doubly funny if you
    were high. And, back then, you were.</p><p>
    From the tender age of three, I was weaned on Firesign albums with titles like <i>Waiting for the Electrician
    or Someone Like Him</i> and <i>Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers</i>. What first struck me was the
    texture of the old-time radio dramas they spoofed: the distorted and insipid orchestral themes, the nasal
    and oblivious announcers, the squinting sleuths, snake-oil salesmen, and ingénues-- and that hiss and crackle
    that made it all seem so present. Then, I started to latch on to little bits of language, whose total freedom
    from context didn't perturb me in the slightest-- like the moment when a confused straight-man asks the
    patriotic chorus, ""Who <i>am</i> us, anyway?"" and they reply, ""We're one of <i>you!</i>""</p><p>
    But it was the hints of satire that kept me listening, as I started to sense a certain distance between what
    was being said and what any reasonable person could possibly mean, such as when a faithful choir sings, ""Oh
    blinding light/ Oh light that blinds/ I cannot see/ Look out for me!"" Of course now, hearing one of the
    early broadcasts where the Lone Ranger ducks behind a rock to smoke a doob with Tonto, or hearing a children's
    how-to record outlining the ""four basic methods of acquiring marijuana: buying it, growing it, receiving it
    as a gift, and stealing it,"" I can't help but wonder what my parents were thinking exposing me to this stuff
    at such a young age. Right on, mom and dad.</p><p>
    The guys have stuck together, pursuing side projects but releasing material of varying quality on and off
    since the 60s, and most of it doesn't suck. In fact, their 1998 album <i>Give Me Immortality or Give Me
    Death</i>, an uncanny look at a top 40 radio station on the brink of apocalypse, is quite good. But they're
    not exactly a laugh riot anymore. I remember a big reunion show in Berkeley about ten years ago, which was
    bearable because they were willing to repeat the old shtick like ""Nick Danger: Third Eye"" and ""Beat the
    Reaper"" to please the aging crowd. But when they try...</p><p>
    Okay, hold on, hold on. I've gotten this far without so much as mentioning the new album, <i>All Things
    Firesign</i>, a collection of clips that aired on NPR in the last year or so. I don't want to mention it,
    because the whole thing-- starting with the stupid title and ending with a stupid, stupid sketch called
    ""A St. Nick Dangerous Christmas Eve""-- was so difficult to get through that I don't feel right judging
    it.  But I will: It sucks.</p><p>
    In a fit of political fervor spurred by 9/11, it seems, Firesign signed on for the occasional radio ""column""
    on <i>All Things Considered</i>. In these forced five-minute segments, the boys are always on-topic, flashing
    their liberal credentials and filling their quota of laboriously up-to-the-minute political references. All
    traces of the old unhinged wit have been crushed in order to make the segments topical in the worst possible
    way. To make things even worse, the group's stale insight and crappy wordplay are launched into the territory
    of genuine unlistenability by the very relentless pacing that once made them great.</p><p>
    The end result is a lot like trying to read <i>The Nation</i> on nitrous oxide: Certainly not instructive,
    and quite possibly not bearable. Now it's possible I don't have the proper historical distance, or that
    current events are too serious to merit the usual surreal treatment. But the problem became clearer when
    in the middle of an awful segment one of them yelled out of the blue: ""Don't forget, comedy is heavier than
    gravity!"" Even <i>they</i> know their new material is falling flat. If they ever stop suffocating under the
    burden of earnest commentary, I might start listening again.</p></div>"|3068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3068-all-things-firesign/|1.7|Jascha Hoffman

Along the way, they passed through
    <i>A Place in the Sun</i>, their brilliant, expansive 2000 album that ironically saw huge, dark clouds scudding over their trademark sun-scorched
    instrumentals.  The outfit's fifth album, <i>On the Shore</i>, is something of an odd package, splitting two discs between (somewhat) old and new
    material.  The first disc houses the <i>Wichita Lineman</i> EP, originally released in Europe on the venerable Glitterhouse label, as well as three live tracks
    taken from the <i>Live at Club 2</i> EP (also from Glitterhouse).  Disc two is essentially the new <i>On the Shore</i> album, but the material
    all comes from such similar headspace that the whole set winds up sounding very much of a piece with itself.</p><p>
    
    Disc one opens with the quiet, almost comforting sound of a film projector, lulling you into a false sense of security before the aptly titled ""Overload""
    blows out your windows with a sudden burst of skull-crushing fuzz bass and acid-drenched guitar, heavier than anything any reasonable person ever would've
    expected from these guys.  The six tracks of the <i>Lineman</i> EP cohere like nothing else in the band's catalogue, flowing with surprising grace from the
    frayed blast of ""Overload"" to the spooky desert nighttime of ""Alternate Theme"", which morphs from a lazy acoustic stroll drenched in mellotron into a
    soup of brooding organ and sustained guitar tones, then back again, without batting an eye.  The tension of one piece feeds the release of the next and
    vice versa: it's an incredibly natural flow.</p><p>
    
    Though overarching mood is their primary strength, Friends of Dean Martinez are great at crafting little moments that make your ears perk up, like the spot
    where the texture shifts from inky black cymbals and muddy guitars to a clear, shuffling beat and Bill Elm's pedal steel spills out the aching melody of
    ""Through the Whine"".  Elm's steel guitar is the band's primary voice, and he muffles the instrument's country
    pretenses with an approach that brings to mind David Gilmour's soul-spilling, slightly damaged lead style of decades ago.  This is on heavy display on the
    band's live cover of ""The Tennessee Waltz"" later on the disc, where he mines the basic sadness of the original tale-- losing a lover to a friend--
    to staggering effect.  Patti Page never sounded so evocative in her entire life.</p><p>
    
    As solid as the first disc is, the second one is obviously the main course, pushing their sound in new, more abstract directions, and
    unearthing the band's jazzy core.  ""H-Hour Minus Five"" rises from the deep like air bubbles from a sunken submarine, Elm using everything from
    his steel to Theremin, piano and the Casio CZ-101 synthesizer to create the most unsettled mood possible.  It's the kind of thing I'd sooner expect
    from a band on Alien8, and it's wholly enveloping.  ""And Love to Be the Master of Hate"" hardly takes a more traditional shape with its wall of dark-hued
    keyboards and guitar outbursts from Mike Semple; Dave LaChance's drums roll and stomp, constantly shifting the rhythmic basis of the song to affect
    change in the other players.</p><p>
    
    Other songs reflect the band's old Southwestern desert sound more overtly, like the swooning ""Under the Waves"" and the boiling ""Time's Not Your
    Friend"", where Elm's parched steel squares off against Semple's brushfire fretwork.  Semple is quickly establishing himself as the most contemplative
    Friend of Dean, as his gorgeous composition ""Indian Summer"" sits heavy and cold like the desert night, in the middle of the disc, slathered in icy
    Chamberlin and skeletal guitar parts.  His other contribution to the second disc, ""Cahuenga"", feels a little more like the sunrise, with Elm's organ breathing
    softly in the background as Semple's simple guitar parts meditate gracefully, pushed along only by a simple, steady pulse on a bass.</p><p>
    
    By the time the sun's up, Friends of Dean Martinez are pretty far from where they started out years ago, before Joey Burns and John Convertino
    left to form Calexico and the remaining members took their tongues out of their cheeks.  They've developed into a band that can effortlessly extract the
    beauty from emptiness, while taking you on some pretty strange detours in the process.  I'll always recommend <i>A Place in the Sun</i> over their other
    albums (unless, God willing, they make a better one in the future), but <i>On the Shore</i> is a two disc set full of refined, potent ideas, merely
    less expansive than their most daunting, celebrated effort.</p></div>"|3202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3202-on-the-shore/|8.1|Joe Tangari

When <i>\xC1gaetis Byrjun</i> dropped like a catatonic bliss bomb at
    the turn of the millennium, it was hailed as an astonishing breakthrough, an instant classic that struck
    a perfect chord between pastoral purity and neo-futurism.  A serene, old-world simplicity echoed in its
    glacial disposition, inadvertently playing to our glamorized perceptions of the Icelandic dreamworld that
    gave birth to it, while the album's epic grandeur, overripe with fervid emotional outpouring, spoke to our
    excitement for a new era of infinite possibility, the refresh of beginning anew, and the triumph of having
    prevailed over the prophesied cataclysm of Y2K.  Plus, it was great to fuck to.</p><p>
    But somehow, when the band's new album arrived last November-- and maybe this is just me, but-- anticipation
    for its arrival seemed lower than expected.  I mean, people were <i>interested</i>, right, but there didn't
    seem to be the same kind of palpable enthusiasm as surrounded, say, <i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</i>.
    I've spent some time speculating as to why this might have been, and initially, I chalked it up to the
    extraordinary sameness of <i>\xC1gaetis Byrjun</i>.  Though notable for possessing one of the more unique
    sounds of the past decade, <i>\xC1gaetis</i> didn't offer much in the way of variety, which presumably led
    to fans fearing the band would be content to offer more of the same.  (They were right, by the way.)</p><p>
    That was only half of it.  I think that, deeper down, the wide-eyed optimism, innocence and cathartic joy
    offered by <i>\xC1gaetis Byrjun</i>-- as well as that of <i>( )</i>-- just isn't with people like it once
    was.  When that landmark record saw release in the first months of 2000, we were still reeling from the
    dot-com boom, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq habitually climbed several full percentage points each weekday, and
    technology was leaping at unprecedented rates; the nation's gravest concern lied with an oversexed president.
    Since then, a crumbling economy, terrorism, and the looming potential of WWIII have decimated our peace of
    mind.  It's only right that the once comforting and contented Sigur Rós sound now strikes as somewhat naïve.</p><p>
    So there could hardly be a better time for the band to shift gears, which is what they've done, to some
    extent, with their <i>Hlemmur</i> soundtrack.  There are only so many changes this band could make to their
    music without losing their signature sound (becoming a garage-rock band isn't one of them, though if they'd
    refashioned themselves as a Motörhead knockoff called ""The Sigur Rós"", I think the shock would wear off
    pretty fast), and to their credit, they've made most of them here.  Where previous outings witnessed Sigur
    Rós mapping out sprawling, eight-plus-minute sonatas doused in spacious reverb and Jon Thor Birgisson's
    choirboy lilt, <i>Hlemmur</i>'s tracks average roughly two minutes each, sans-vocals.  The songs still ring
    with the same dampened production that graced <i>Agaetis Byrjun</i> and <i>( )</i>, but the band's idyllic
    hopefulness has been replaced with a subtle malaise, and the overall effect is rarely as sweeping as on
    their official full-lengths.</p><p>
    This, of course, is likely due more to the nature of the film for which this music served as a score than
    to any permanent adjustment to Sigur Rós' modus operandi: <i>Hlemmur</i> is an independent film by director
    Ólafur Sveinsson, which documents the lives of the inhabitants of Reykjavik's central bus station, from
    which the picture takes its name.  Throughout the feature, Sveinsson interviews the homeless and/or drug-addled
    nomads that frequent the hub while, ""with unexpected candor, they tell of the monotony of their existence,
    their hopelessness, addiction and misery.""  At times, this draws Sigur Rós toward a sound of grandiose
    bleakness, not unlike that of their orchestral brethren Godspeed You Black Emperor!, though never as
    defiantly bombastic; other times, the band offers standard-fare Icelandic IDM, owing its warm, melodic
    tones and analog drones to compatriots Múm and Boards of Canada.</p><p>
    But mostly, this is Sigur Rós without the constraints of focus and melody that drew people to them in the
    first place.  <i>Hlemmur</i> consists largely of empty ambiance, intended more for setting a tone in its
    cinematic counterpart than for home listening.  As a score, the music serves its purpose, suggesting a
    certain mood (if always a somewhat vague one) without drawing attention from the stories told by the
    station's denizens.  However, once the initial interest of hearing Sigur Rós in a slightly different
    context wears off, the music has a similar effect in your apartment or bedroom, rarely offering a moment
    to wake you to its presence.</p><p>
    These moments do come, on occasion: ""Hvalir í útrymingarhaettu"" features a dense, muddied drone topped with
    reversed piano chords and the highly processed and pitchshifted vocalizing of Jon Thor Birgisson for peculiar,
    squeaking/squawking effects, and ""\xC1fram Island"", after opening with a low-tech, preprogrammed samba beat,
    blossoms into a beautiful piano and xylophone prelude.  But ""\xDEversögn"", while notable for its departure
    from the album's usual sound, doesn't fare quite as well: It once again employs that low-tech samba beat
    while the band offers an elementary keyboard improvisation that clearly means to be spooky, but instead
    ends up the desert music from <i>Super Mario 2</i>.</p><p>
    Interestingly, Sigur Rós never seem fully able to immerse themselves in the pale resignation that would be
    more suited to this documentary; there's always a light gauze of positivism in their major-chord drones--
    which might even work in their favor here, were this kind of utopian reverie not such a tired theme of their
    records.  Fortunately, the record isn't given a chance to wear out its welcome too badly, as the band throws
    us yet another surprise curveball: Even at 19 tracks, <i>Hlemmur</i> comes out at roughly half the duration
    of their usual 80-minute marathons.  Still, the casual Sigur Rós fan won't likely find much to love here;
    though <i>Hlemmur</i> is certainly a beautiful record, beauty only stretches so far without the substance
    to back it.</p></div>"|7150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7150-hlemmur/|6.1|Ryan Schreiber

    Implosion, one third of Sebadoh (Pollard), and the ex-front man of Lowercase (Wasif), but they sound more like a troupe of psych-heads from Olivia
    Tremor Control than Lou Barlow collaborators. On <i>Emotions</i>, Alaska!'s first album, the closest link to Barlow's aesthetic is the no-caps,
    handwritten liner notes. <i>Emotions</i> is slicker than Lou's Shrimper cassettes and even some of Sebadoh's Sub Pop albums, but that carefree spirit of
    camaraderie is similar.</p><p>
    
    Though Alaska! didn't leave much of an initial impression, resonance emerged over time, clarifying details and offering seemingly endless nooks of
    beauty worth exploring.  I felt the Incredible String Band at the beginning of ""Rust And Cyanide"", and ""Resistance"" is almost Simon and Garfunkel, though
    not in the horrible elevator way Kings of Convenience translated them. Pollard and Wasif's voices lock together almost perfectly, like a single
    track doubled-up.  The fade-away chorus of ""The Western Sphere"" had me imagining the duo backing away from the microphone and into some beautiful, hazy
    field as they breathe out the words; it's a gentle brushstroke Olivia Tremor Control use quite a bit. ""Love (To Be Your Main)"" evokes late-era Elliott
    Smith, sharing a similar build-up approach with ""Bled White"" and ""Baby Britain"". ""Broken"" could also be Smith, but during his Kill Rock
    Stars days: it has his falsetto, guitar percussion, and vocal lines resolved by shaking off the words.  Though their reference points are somewhat
    obvious, Alaska! layer music differently than their primary predecessor.  Whereas Smith bows to George Martin, Pollard and Wasif appear to be
    more fascinated by darker instrumentation, similar at times to the whirl of a pre-blow-out 13th Floor Elevators.</p><p>
    
    The only real clunkers on <i>Emotions</i> are  the last two tracks, ""Nightmare X"" and ""In My Time"".  ""Nightmare X"" goes nowhere, weirdly
    reminiscent of Smog's ""Be Hit"", which Lou Barlow took a stab at on 1995's <i>Lou Barlow Plays Waterfront</i>; ""In My Time"" is a repetitious mess of
    faux bravura where Pollard and Wasif sing ""inside the nightmare of my dream"" with seemingly straight faces, evoking the ridiculous semi-illiterate
    solipsism of late-period Black Heart Procession and, at times, the naive guitar crackle of early Radiohead.  This ""big guitar"" misstep is redolent of
    another awful masturbatory finish, ""Evil Keneival"", which haunts the CD-version of Lilys otherwise shimmering <i>A Brief History of Amazing Letdowns</i>.</p><p>
    
    Whatever my minor gripes, Alaska! have constructed an impressive first album. On ""Rust and Cyanide"" the state and the band are evoked as place, person,
    history, and ""glorious world.""  This extended metaphor reminded me of the Velvet Underground's ""Stephanie Says"", in which ""Alaska"" is a nickname
    and a reasoning: ""She's not afraid to die, the people all call her Alaska."" Weirdly, I kept hearing Reed as I listened to this, another fragment of
    beauty affixed to an already dreamy landscape.  Perhaps Alaska! decided their work should embody the roller coaster evoked by the album's title;
    feelings are anything but balanced, but by making the two dourest tracks on <i>Emotions</i> its grand finale, they seem to feed into a general model
    of glorified self-loathing, as if it's too naive to escape a record on a high note.  I'm definitely no optimist, but ending things with the resplendent
    ""Resistance"" would've been wiser: it's a stronger song that the other two, a four-minute meditation about, waking up, getting out of a town,
    breathing in the seasons and going back home.  It gets cold and dark in Alaska, sure, but don't forget the months where there's never a sunset.</p></div>"|96.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/96-facts-and-fictions/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

Blumm as one half of the duo Sack &amp; Blumm, partner to Harald ""Sack"" Ziegler, the go-to
    guy whenever Mouse on Mars wants a horn on their records. Sack &amp; Blumm have released two full-length records together (one on Tomlab,
    one on the pre-Sonig Dommert/Jan St. Werner-run imprint Gefriem); F.S. Blumm made his full length solo debut in 2001 on Morr with <i>Mondkuchen</i>.</p><p>
    Though he moves in electronic circles, Blumm uses more than a mouse to create his music. In fact, synthetic sounds are rare on <i>Ankhern</i>, his
    second full-length, and impressively, he plays most of the instruments himself. In both his one-man-band approach and the overall sound of the record,
    Blumm has <em>a lot</em> in common with Mice Parade. Cleanly picked electric guitar outlines the chord structure, melodic lines come care of cello,
    vibraphone and horns (yup, that's Sack on the brass).  The compositions tend to focus on rhythm and repetition à la classical minimalism: It's music
    that is crisp and beautiful on its surface, easy to like immediately, with a certain staying power, but ultimately a bit difficult to fall in
    love with.</p><p>
    I hate to fault a record so consistently lovely as <i>Ankern</i>; there's really no dip in quality among the ten tracks here, and each sounds so nice it's
    hard to imagine anyone not liking them, whatever their musical background. At times it reminds me of an evocative score to a first rate indie film,
    something like the music Hal Hartley composes for his pictures, a warm thoughtfulness made a bit pale by some unnamable ache. When the
    glow of Sack's trumpet swells up at the conclusion of ""Folge"", finally filling all the empty space left by Blumm's spare plucked guitar and one-note
    vibraphone riff, it feels like the welcome return of an old friend. ""Tal"", with its slower tempo, swaying cello, and increased spaciousness, is definitely
    cinematic, reminding me a bit of the Boxhead Ensemble in the way it conjures the sea. On ""Sprung"", droney sitar and accordion move in
    counterpoint to swirling guitar leads and hypnotic guitar patterns. Each track sounds great on first listen, and continues to please on the tenth, yet
    despite Ankern's positive attributes, something is missing.</p><p>
    The music is almost too clean and orderly for me to feel any deep emotional connection to. Blumm just makes it all sound too easy: sharp melodies,
    well-balanced sound, and tasteful instrumentation. This is not to say that I won't hold on to <i>Ankern</i> and continue to enjoy it occasionally--
    when the mood strikes-- just that <i>Ankern</i> is not the sort of record that crops up on best-of lists come year's end.</p></div>"|826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/826-ankern/|7.0|Mark Richardson

We're sit on the verge of war, and the rest of the world fears
    and loathes us.  A missile just flew over my house, and though my Korean's a little rusty I think the graffiti
    on the warhead said, ""FROM PYONGYANG WITH LOVE.""  With all that going on, why not close your eyes and pretend
    to be somewhere peaceful, somewhere cut-off and faraway-- like Australia?</p><p>
    
    With their soft, calm sound and assuringly warm vocals, Art of Fighting are determined to help you get your
    mellow on.  This Melbourne-based band helped show Stephen Malkmus around when supporting one of his Australian
    tours, and now, with the American release of <i>Wires</i>, they're doing the same for us.  Their full-length
    debut introduces them as a spare, dreamy slowcore band: The album is heavily reverbed but too guitar-based
    and concrete to be ethereal, and it's recorded with the flawless cool of a glass sculpture.</p><p>
    
    The album's eleven tracks are beautifully melodic, if sometimes too homogenous.  The pleasantly yearning
    ""Skeletons"" gives way to the faster ""Give Me Tonight"" (which weirdly resembles Leo Sayer's 70s chestnut
    ""When I Need You""); from there the album ebbs and flows, as a few louder songs drift among the soft ones.
    Singer Ollie Browne echoes the way Thom Yorke handles his most delicate ballads (think ""Fake Plastic Trees"");
    Browne expresses aching, shallow-breathing vulnerability while staying precisely on pitch.  He doesn't give
    it much lungpower-- when his birthday rolls around he probably blows out three candles, four tops-- but he's
    ideal for this passively beautiful music.  Bassist Peggy Frew later provides a break with her rougher, more
    earthen vocals on ""I Don't Keep a Record"".</p><p>
    
    A few tracks stand out for having some tremors of drama: ""Moonlight"", co-written by Browne and his Remotes
    bandmate Kristian Brenchley, strikingly moves from whispers to crescendos.  And the album as a whole follows
    a soft-to-loud-to-hushed arc, all the way through to the shoegazingly extended, just-short-of-glorious guitars
    on ""Something New"", which ends the album.  But while Art of Fighting create a strong mood, they never
    completely fill it.  The songwriting, while tuneful, could be tighter, and the lyrics don't help: Two
    lovers want to be together but they're kept apart, for some unknown reason; or they're together but it
    doesn't work out, for some other reason that remains unclear.  It's not that Art of Fighting need punchy
    or witty lyrics, but the vague words, which are sometimes too thin on nouns and adjectives, make songs
    like ""Akula"" all the more indistinct.</p><p>
    
    For some listeners this album could be too little to take: The few gripping moments are surrounded by mellow
    sections that drift into the background.  If the band ratchets up the writing, though, they could make an
    album that's just as nice but far stronger-- the kind that invites you to pay close attention, but that's
    just as rewarding if you don't.</p></div>"|300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/300-wires/|6.5|Chris Dahlen

    in the presence of music when it leans over and takes unto its confidence.
    As it is for the audience.  In this moment everything else is irrelevant and
    without power.  For those in music, this is the moment when life becomes
    unreal.""<br/>
                                                                                    --Robert Fripp, 1992</i></p><p>
    For all his scholarly quips and curmudgeonly demeanor, King Crimson founder
    and guitarist Robert Fripp has gone to great pains to keep his feet planted
    firmly on the ground.  Unlike some of his first-generation progressive rock
    peers of the late 60s and early 70s, he never allowed his band to leap into
    the abyss of new age fantasy or wanky tech-pomp.  At all points during
    Crimson's many-membered lifetime, Fripp has been the model of humble
    workmanship: You can usually count on him to 1) hate the music business, 2)
    refuse to rest on his laurels, and 3) practice his guitar.  It makes sense
    that he wouldn't expect much pleasure from record sales or a cult of fans as
    obsessive as they come-- after all, it's the musician's job to strive for
    excellence in the face of commerce and compromise.</p><p>
    And it shouldn't bother him that during the course of his 35-year,
    single-minded crusade he's left himself on a desert island with only his
    comfortable legion of fans and bandmates to keep him company.  It's been a
    few years since he was painting London red with Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel and
    David Bowie, and these days Fripp mostly celebrates advanced middle age with
    his wife, English garden and the latest version of his storied band.  Sure,
    his records sound more than a little like shadows (albeit of the highest
    quality) of his classic past efforts, but it's not as if rock history is
    littered with grandfatherly figures re-inventing the wheel.  <i>""Hey man, lay
    off Fripp-- King Crimson is the best prog band ever!""</i>  I know it is, I
    do; I really wish I could get past the irony of a progressive rock band
    being unable to progress.</p><p>
<i>The Power to Believe</i> is the band's 13th studio LP, and the third
    featuring the current lineup of Fripp, Adrian Belew, Trey Gunn and Pat
    Mastelotto.  Last year, the buzz about this record was that it was going
    to be the result of Crimson's ear to xFC-metal, and having toured with Tool--
    in fact, the working title was <i>Nuovo Metal</i>.  Last year's <i>Happy
    with What You Have to Be Happy With</i> EP offered some preliminary tastes
    of this direction, as did the deluge of recent live releases, including
    2001's <i>Level Five</i>, and the Projekcts albums.  I'm happy to report
    that <i>Power</i> is much less awful than that EP, and more consistently
    interesting than the sprawling live CDs.  That said, there is an omnipresent
    residue of stagnancy that has covered just about everything King Crimson
    have released since 1995's <i>Thrak</i>, and this record is no less stained.</p><p>
    Fans of the mid-1970s lineup should find the most to enjoy on <i>Power to
    Believe</i>, as it not only finds King Crimson playing with muscular
    aggression similar to that period, but also revisiting the group improvisation
    that set them so far apart from other 70s prog bands.  The title suite--
    arranged in four movements; Fripp still loves the symphonic form-- begins
    and ends as a sort-of haiku verse penned by Belew, but the middle sections
    are reminiscent of the lengthy excursions from 1992's excellent <i>Great
    Deceiver</i> box set, of their 1973-74 tours.  Exotic percussion (Jaime
    Muir, where are you?), floating Frippertronics, and fretless basslines
    (ahem, ""Warr guitar"") flesh out what seems like very familiar territory.</p><p>
    It is, of course, a credit to the band that they manage to retain the
    adventurous spirit of past incarnations, whether or not the end result is
    a tad stale-- Fripp's solo on ""Part III"" is pretty cool, after all, and the
    driving, minimal ""Dangerous Curves"" reminds me of ""The Talking Drum"" from
    <i>Larks' Tongues</i>, right down to the repeating bassline and ending on
    a wall of dissonant noise.</p><p>
    The band also throws a few bones to modern electronic music with ""Level
    Five"" and ""Elektronic"".  The former tune is a fairly standard instrumental
    in the style of ""Red"", or more recently, ""Thrak""-- though not quite as
    ferocious as either.  However, Mastelotto's drum parts are injected with
    occasional glitch and Aphex-style stutter, giving the groove a somewhat
    refreshing (at least for anyone who never heard Aphex) wrinkle.  The latter
    tune fares better, if only because the efforts don't seem like hopeless
    catch-up exercises.  Oh wait, yes they do, because I'm pretty sure those
    Prodigy beats were stale about six months into 1997.  Anyway, the tunes
    are right on time for Crimson fans, and if you wanted to, you could easily
    tune out the barely there computer touches.</p><p>
    There are moments without many redeeming qualities: The dad-joke ""Happy with
    What You Have to Be Happy With"" survives in full form from its self-titled
    EP here, and alas, is still embarrassingly out of touch.  Likewise, ""Facts
    of Life"" features just as clueless a take on metal as the former tune, and
    Belew's ridiculously holier-than-thou lyrics detailing how ""some of us
    build, and some of us teach"" (he forgot the ones who provide public service
    announcements), and how ""nobody knows what happens when you die.""  These
    things are ""fact[s] of life,"" he says.  Now, if he could only throw in a
    verse about how ""the president thinks he's so smart, but you know what,
    he's not,"" we'd be set.</p><p>
    Despite all the unfortunate narrative (which, in itself is reminiscent of
    most Crimson records) and quaint ""updates"" in sound, this record should
    please quite a few fans.  Even as my brain tells me that the Crimson well
    is probably dry, my fist wants to pump during the breakdowns in ""Level
    Five"".  Fact is, very few bands have a command of their own voice as well as Fripp
    and Crimson, and I suppose when you've been at it for so long, mastery comes
    with the territory.  I can admit to feeling some of that old Crim magic a
    few times during <i>Power to Believe</i>, but would be kidding myself if I
    thought it was as potent a spell as their adventures of yore.</p></div>"|4441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4441-the-power-to-believe/|6.3|Dominique Leone

<li> Anglophilia slightly more socially acceptable than necrophilia<p>
<li> Want to support our noble allies in the perennially impending war by funding music industry<p>
<li> Lingering colonial Stockholm Syndrome manifesting itself in our collective musical taste<p>
<li> Not satisfied with faux-slang from <i>The Hipster Handbook</i><p>
    
    Or maybe, just maybe it's because the UK is such a damn little fertile isle for the development of music,
    as evidenced by their decades-long hold on various levels of American listeners.  Right now, for instance,
    the Union Jack is doing little business on the Billboard charts, but is being fetishized below the radar
    for evolution-tree offshoots like the garage scene and mashups.  Have you heard of this guy called The
    Streets?</p><p>
    
    A great deal of this Transatlantic love seems to be a result of British talent for making stylistic
    casserole, taking a pink eraser to the lines between genres.  Which is where The Bees come in, a
    hard-to-categorize group that shares much of their aesthetic with Astralwerks mates The Beta Band and
    Simian.  Ostensibly a rock band in its foundations, The Bees (known in the U.S. as A Band of Bees,
    due to some hott legal action) stirs in elements from a wide variety of sources, including tropicalia,
    dance music, and 70s soundtrack soul.</p><p>
    
    It's all summed up nicely by the cover at the chewy nougat center of <i>Sunshine Hit Me</i>, a conservative
    runthrough of Os Mutantes' ""A Minha Menina"".  Like those frenzied Brazilians, The Bees excel at
    wadding up disparate elements into a vaguely psychedelic sound containing a believable tropical flair--
    despite hailing from the Isle of Wight, which grainy festival footage suggests is hardly Rio.  Bear
    witness, for example, to ""No Trophy"", a reggae that somehow circumvents Official
    Pitchfork Policy of loathing that entire genre.</p><p>
    
    It's the fine opener ""Punchbag"" that steals the show here, however, growing from a music box Rhodes figure
    into a piece of dreamy microhouse that utilizes a near-glitch bassline and glass-bottle percussion that
    could've been lifted from a Prefuse 73 track.  Similar elements frolic through ""Angry Man"", though this
    time with vocals that more clearly recall Curtis Mayfield than Wayne Coyne, and rich organ adding polyester
    strut.</p><p>
    
    As the disc plays on, though, the tempo drops, and with it the score.  The second half of the disc
    misguidedly trades in the eccentricities of the above tracks for piano-focused atmospherics and analog
    chillouts, reducing the affair to competent and inoffensive (if not terribly interesting) backdrops like
    those of Zero 7.  Whereas the Side A instrumental ""Sunshine"" nicely breaks the getting-tired <i>Moon Safari</i>
    mold with moments of loose jazz-rock jamming, the backloaded quartet of downtempo numbers that ends the
    album does so on a breezily hookless note.</p><p>
<i>Sunshine Hit Me</i> does, however, remain an above-average production of reasonable merit, further proof
    that Astralwerks seems to have cornered the market on decent, but not quite excellent rock/electronic hybrid
    bands with potential.  To wit, The Bees show signs of having creative reserves deep enough to power a
    long career; whether that career will be in pushing boundaries of genre collision or scoring commercials
    for text messaging remains to be seen.  Still, their debut album has a handful of singles suitable for
    airplay in that Clear Channel-free wonderland of Engerland, singles good enough to quicken the breath of
    those of us whose toes curl at the site of a ""UK import"" sticker.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|1125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1125-sunshine-hit-me/|7.4|Rob Mitchum

    band's image, allowing it to supercede the importance of the music in the interest of provoking a laugh
    or making what is often a frivolous, irrelevant point. A great deal of bands, from the early mop-top days
    of The Beatles to the afro'd At the Drive-In of today, have found their otherwise wonderful and perfectly
    noteworthy music suffocated by the ink given to their hair, outfits or backstage antics.  Conversely,
    painfully mediocre bands like Kiss and Cinderella find substantial, undeserved attention simply through
    their flashy dress codes, using their image to blanket lifeless, pedestrian songs.  Needless to say, it's
    a tactic I usually try to avoid.</p><p>
    And so here I try, objectively as I can, to sit through the self-titled debut of Chicago foursome Ok Go.
    From the outset, their look is positively loathsome; four clean-cut, Suburbia-ripped pretty boys aspiring
    to toe the line between indie respectability and commercial adulation. I slide the disc into my CD player,
    glancing briefly at the <i>Blue</i>-era Weezer poster on my wall which optimistically reminds me of the joy
    that could abound.  But as the music begins, and the bland onslaught of creative ineptitude soaks my room,
    my mood takes a nosedive.</p><p>
    Fact is, Ok Go seemed to have made every effort to live up to their immaculate, airbrushed image in their
    music. That the kind of mindless, commercial monotony that dilutes every hint of vibrancy on the record
    seems wholly intentional is telling, as a comparatively lo-fi collection of songs were apparently scrapped
    in favor of this supposedly more accessible dreck. The sort of middle-of-the-road, half power-pop/half
    hair-metal hooks heard on first track and single ""Get Over It"" plays itself out on nearly every track,
    using the monster power chords, obtusely ironic lyrics and anthemic send-up chorus as a blueprint for the
    kind of 21st century arena-rock most people knew we didn't need.</p><p>
    For forty minutes, <i>Ok Go</i> drags on laboriously, with each passing song more desperately anticipating
    the end. Damian Kulash's lyrics are almost uniformly dreadful, but no more so than on ""You're So Damn Hot"",
    what seems to be some kind of aggravating rewrite of ""Bang a Gong"" with all the substance and style drained
    from it. Lines like, ""You're a bad-hearted boy trap, baby doll, but you're/ So damn hot,"" are enough to make
    you despise the English language.  Fortunately, the album is saved from <i>total</i> disaster by the band's
    occasional ear for a good hook, and though you'll knock yourself for it, the reasonably hummable melodies of
    a handful of these tracks may stay with you for the rest of the day.</p><p>
    When push comes to shove though, <i>Ok Go</i> is either a dreadfully calculated, shot-in-the-dark attempt at
    accessibility from a band whose heart is in the underground or simply a dull, styrofoam pop record from a
    bunch of fresh-faced hacks who happened to come across a Weezer fakebook and decided to turn it into a
    career.  Either way, their heart doesn't seem in it, and if you're gonna win the public over, you've gotta
    at least fool them into thinking you mean it.</p></div>"|5956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5956-ok-go/|2.6|Matt Stephens

Many singers embrace higher drama or shred
    their vocal cords with icier shrieks, but there's an eerie steadiness in Hersh's voice-- an enthrallment
    that goes deeper than the mere sound of her singing, part crow, part Wicked Witch of the West and part
    vengeful alternative rock icon.  Of all the artists who've invoked the cliché of losing control to their
    inspiration, Hersh is one of the few to make it convincing; she delivers her most harrowing lyrics with
    a delicate serenity, and her simplest with a frightening, reeling delirium.</p><p>
    Her voice and surreal images were the key to the success of Throwing Muses,
    before the group disbanded.  Hersh didn't want to break up the Muses, the band she's led since
    high school: It ended in the mid-90s for financial, not creative reasons.  And that's the only way to
    explain how, when some funding came through, they could reform and cut a new album that sounds like they'd
    never been apart. Often, critics give a veteran band extra credit when they reunite-- props that were
    perhaps due long ago and never offered, or just bonus points for not having dropped dead in their autumn
    years.  I can't think of many albums that need fewer crutches than this one.  Without rivaling <i>University</i>
    or <i>The Real Ramona</i>, it's different from, yet far rawer than, anything since their debut.</p><p>
    Fans will suck up the nostalgia as Hersh brings back not just her last rhythm section (Bernard Georges on
    bass and mainstay David Narcizo on drums), but also founding Muse Tanya Donelly, who adds seraphic harmony
    vocals.  After several years of sporadic collaborations they jumped into the project without even rehearsing:
    They cut the album in just three weekends with minimal overdubs, giving it a clean and ""live"" sound that
    sticks solidly to an unembellished power trio. There are no acoustic tracks, no slow or atmospheric ballads
    (like <i>University</i>'s ""Crabtown"")-- nothing but torrential, skidding, hard rock, right from the almost
    anthemic first track, ""Mercury"", which cuts through different ways of opening the throttle before it wrenches
    into the chorus.</p><p>
    With such a consistent sound the songs bleed into each other, but Hersh's writing is still intriguingly
    unpredictable.  Some of the songs are catchy almost after the fact-- like the perfect riff and matter-of-fact
    weirdness of her delivery on ""Portia"", or the erupting chorus on ""Pretty or Not"".  Others sound like they
    were Frankensteined together from the verse, chorus and bridge of completely different songs and smoothed
    out by the guitars: You've got the mood change from dark to ecstatic on ""Half Blast""-- if Donelly had written
    any songs here, this would be the one-- or the way ""Solar Dip"" jerks between time signatures. And that's not
    to ignore the grinding dirges like ""Speed and Sleep"" that just pound themselves into a dark hole.</p><p>
    Throwing Muses skip the production polish that brightened up albums like <i>University</i>, but they've
    found the perfect sweetener in Donelly's backing vocals.  As limited as her contribution may be-- she
    sticks to backup and only sings on half the songs-- her lines are melodically gorgeous, high and pure
    against Hersh's lower, somewhat raspy vocals.  But her presence alone isn't what makes this so joyous.
    Throwing Muses are the counterpart-- or maybe the antidote-- to the driven, enraptured solitude of her
    solo material; they deliver a release and an excitement that's been missing from her work for years.  Their
    reunion is heavy, driven stuff-- as inherently inexplicable as the best, darkest Muses work-- but it's also
    ecstatic.  This band has seized an opportunity that may never strike for them again, and they're celebrating
    it as though there were no tomorrow.</p></div>"|8046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8046-throwing-muses/|8.2|Chris Dahlen

As choked out by Stephen Mallinder, this is less of a request than a
    command, and the irony conveyed by his grudging, bile-coated words is plain.  Art is rarely more than intent,
    but ""entertainment,"" let alone ""fun,"" is considerably more demanding; in either case, it takes more than
    speech to so self-consciously elevate an artist's toil.  The rift between assertion and sensible results is
    wide, after all; Mallinder's grim pronouncement at the center of ""This Is Entertainment"" amounts to little
    more than paradox as a consequence.  His words attempt to define the work but the experience says otherwise,
    and that dilemma is the finest part.</p><p>
    
    In fact, in a similar vein to contemporaries like Throbbing Gristle and Suicide, the lifeblood of Cabaret
    Voltaire's body of work is conflict.  Hypnotic, mechanical rhythms struggle with jarring vocal effects and
    disorienting tape manipulation.  The stark, minimal background music refuses to remain obscured, constantly
    demanding a listener's full attention.  The Cabs wrenched science-fiction out of stone-age tech way back in
    1978, calling it, to quote Richard Kirk, ""experimental pop music,"" in a fight to escape ""the slavery of
    dead-end jobs, and most important, to cause trouble.""  These guys pioneered the electro-industrial genre
    ""out of boredom""-- think about that the next time you sit down to watch <i>Blind Date</i>.</p><p>
    
    That's it for a refresher on the work of the oft-unheralded Cabaret Voltaire; it's not the place of this
    review to dwell on congratulatory back-patting or debate this band's place in the pantheon of music's
    heroes.  After all, Mute has compiled a document of their earth-shaking early work, a chronological record
    of development with selections spanning the band's most vital period, and it basically speaks for itself.
    From their first steps on the <i>Extended Play</i> EP through the dual Spartan masterpieces <i>Red Mecca</i>
    and <i>2 X 45</i>, this is a portrait of the Sheffield trio (including master tapehead Chris Watson, prior
    to his departure halfway into the <i>2 X 45</i> sessions) at the darkest height of their considerable powers.
    It doesn't fully succeed at capturing them in the best light, but as a map of their progress, it's
    irreplaceable.</p><p>
    
    Note the simplicity inherent in the tinny, synthetic squeak-beats of ""Do the Mussolini (Headkick)"" in
    contrast with the wailing back-alley sax and driving rhythm of ""Wait &amp; Shuffle"".  Compare the tense dynamic
    created between the erratic bass rumblings and pulsating, omnipresent whine of ""The Set-Up"" with ""Yashar""'s
    barely there Arabian textures.  All of the material predates Cabaret Voltaire's eventual move towards
    dancefloor electronica shortly after Watson called it quits, and so it shares the same bleak, oppressive
    vibe.  Nevertheless, the contrast between the band's early singles and the material from <i>Red Mecca</i>
    and <i>2 X 45</i> makes for a jarring listen.  The complexity of these compositions increases in magnitude
    from album to album; for that reason alone, it's striking to hear the succession of tracks included.  By
    the time it comes around to 1981, you can almost hear history taking root.</p><p>
    
    The shame of it is that on some level, the home-movie-esque documentation of Cabaret Voltaire's ""gestation
    period""-- a number of singles, as well as samples from the first two full-lengths, <i>Mix-Up</i> and <i>The
    Voice of America</i>-- just can't present the best possible album.  As impressive as many of these cuts are,
    the stepping stones to greatness aren't in the same league as the finished product.  Excepting the absolute
    necessity of the included ""No Escape"" and ""This Is Entertainment"", a simple best-of could be culled from
    nothing but the strongest moments of their early 80s material.  It's not severely to the detriment of
    <i>The Original Sound of Sheffield</i> to do without the numerous alternative contenders it eliminates, but
    there's still the unmistakable sting of a missed opportunity.  At the very least, the collection presents an
    astonishing succession of advances; Cabaret Voltaire's music was truly ""built from nothing"" and that has
    rarely been as evident as it is here.</p></div>"|1210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1210-the-original-sound-of-sheffield-78-82-the-best-of/|8.0|Eric Carr

She held a thin flashlight between
    her lips as she meshed together the moaning Bowie choir from side two of <i>Low</i> with the percussive
    thumps of her Warp labelmates, Boards of Canada. It was a wonderfully woozy night, and she DJed with
    a deft touch, moving in and out of the vinyl grooves, merging sundry vibes and keeping the headspace
    at a nice high. The big balls of Spanish hash making their way around the room didn't hurt things,
    either, heads nodding within blissful alpha states.</p><p>
    
    That was years back, and I wondered what she'd been up to this whole time.  Her latest effort for Warp
    shows she's been doing basically the same thing as she was that night, looking for the perfect dream
    state rather than the perfect beat. It's all about the mix, a steady shifting of textures
    and unobtrusive rhythmic circles that careen like spinning plates, their centers slowly wobbling,
    deteriorating as the next pattern begins to assimilate and congeal.</p><p>
<i>Skimskitta</i> opens with some e-bowed guitar and glitch noise, before moving into the unadorned
    piano and rasping breaths of ""Poussou"". The beats don't formally appear until track three, ""Woody"",
    and they quickly skitter and dribble away like mercury as the gongs resonate, her low-mixed voice drifting
    in and out of consciousness. ""The Wolf, the Sheep, &amp; the Door"" is slightly more kinetic, conjuring
    up the deep drums of Haruomi Hosono's <i>Cochin Moon</i> while simultaneously working out the
    combination on a safe, ticking away, slowly immersing her vocals in a salty ocean of fizzling
    crackles.</p><p>
    
    As it flows downstream, you become aware of far-off echoes of gamelan percussion coming
    from the overgrown databanks of this river, as well as the innocent tricklings of keyboards, leading
    slowly into the record's centerpiece, ""I May Be Over There (But My Heart is Over Here)"". Calix mixes
    together guitar feedback, wind chimes, and her almost untraceable voice as piano recital patterns
    return to awkwardly move it along.  This boat doesn't go anywhere, merely floating and turning in
    place, but your head spins nevertheless, blissfully discombobulated.</p><p>
    
    ""Paarl"" and ""Shadenfreude"" feature Mira's vocals, but once again they remain far too low in the mix,
    making me wonder whether she doesn't trust her voice, or is trying to make a subliminal mix-tape.
    The harmonium and organ accompaniment flow well with the clicking beats, but from there the album
    submerges into blurry, indistinct washes, as individualized tracks give way to Calix's mutability,
    stirring the percussion and digital debris about, never letting the bits quite settle to the bottom
    nor revealing her recipe. <i>Skimskitta</i> isn't particularly strong or potent, but it's
    relaxed and smooth enough to induce a very mellow, mild buzz.</p></div>"|1245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1245-skimskitta/|7.3|Andy Beta

Consider how often you
    listen to anything post-<i>Under the Bushes</i> these days, if you doubt it.  With Toby in the ranks, GBV
    had that semblance of balance necessary in all great bands, Sprout's quick interjections of bashfulness
    standing out like a cardigan in a biker bar amidst Robert Pollard's boozy leg-kicks.  When the guitarist
    dropped out of the Ohio fantasy rock camp and moved to Michigan, Pollard booted the rest of his Dayton
    lineup, signed up ""real"" musicians, and promptly drove the GBV franchise into a tree.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, Sprout, off in his own orbit and presumably concentrating more on his photo-realistic paintings,
    never stopped recording.  After his odds-and-ends debut <i>Carnival Boy</i> pulled a surprising upset over
    the simultaneously released Pollard-wank <i>Not in My Airforce</i>, Tobin spun a bunch of lonely basement
    nights into the drearily touching <i>Moonflower Plastic</i>, before being punted by Matador.</p><p>
    
    Alas, from there on out the returns have been of the diminishing sort, first taking the one-man act thing
    too far with the disappointing <i>Let's Welcome the Circus People</i>, then falling way short of olden days
    with his own band, Eyesinweasel.  Even postally collaborating with his old drinking pal Pollard via their
    Airport 5 project yielded disappointment, uncomfortably welding as it did Sprout's unassuming music to Uncle
    Bob's blustery vocals.</p><p>
    
    So I was just about running empty on enthusiasm for Tobin Sprout, but thought I'd give <i>Lost Planets,
    Phantom Voices</i> a try, for old time's sake.  Pleasingly, within I found a handful of tracks stronger
    than anything he's produced since <i>Moonflower Plastic</i>-- ""Cleansing from the Storm"" a reminder of
    Sprout's ability to pen an anthem that nervously toes the ground rather than swaggers, ""Catch the Sun""
    (ft. Jim MacPherson) a reminder how much better Sprout sounded when he turned elsewhere for the drumming.
    Sprout even turns in his twee ID for a lower-register warble on ""As Lovely as You"" that sounds, dare I say,
    Interpol-ish! (Oh, take me now, Lord.)</p><p>
    
    But the majority of <i>Lost Planets</i> merely parades out more examples of the weaknesses in Sprout's solo
    catalog, first and foremost being his studio solitude.  Toby, my man, I don't know how to break this to you,
    but you're not the greatest musician technically.  Which is fine!  It's fine... but in light of that, the
    goin'-it-alone thing just ain't working.  Much of <i>Lost Planets</i> is marred by a kind-of midtempo
    sameness (""Rub Your Buddha Tummy"", ""Indian Ink""), most likely due to your intermediate drumming skills.</p><p>
    
    Sprout's mid-fi recording techniques are the other major problem with his recent work, up to and including
    <i>Lost Planets</i>; the sound amplifies his technical limitations by adding little in the way of sonic
    character.  Given Tobin's thin voice, a mix that's heavy on the upper frequencies can cause acute trebleitis,
    ""Let Go of My Beautiful Balloon"" and ""Earth Links"" sounding particularly washed out without a low-end anchor.
    Awkwardly formulaic instrumentals don't help matters, either, be it the cookie-cutter surf of ""Martini"" or
    the keyboard waltz of ""Fortunes Theme No. 1"" (leave it to the French, Toby).</p><p>
    
    But more than anything, it's just distressing to see Sprout evolving on a parallel course with Pollard, both
    of them forgetting that unrehearsed energy and verse/chorus/get-the-fuck-out structures were what got them
    into our record collections in the first place.  It's also starting to become abundantly clear that Sprout
    is better enjoyed as a side dish than as a main course, his first couple albums notwithstanding.  It's almost
    certainly too late to be holding out hope that Tobin will one day reassume his position at the right hand of
    King Pollard's throne, but maybe, just maybe, there's a prolific schoolteacher in northern Michigan with a
    four-track and a drinking problem we could set him up with?</p></div>"|7444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7444-lost-planets-phantom-voices/|6.0|Rob Mitchum

    shredding his throat as he shrieks and sneers about hacking up nuns and priests.</p><p>

    this version though, which is unmerciful in its dying animal howls and corpse-thudding bass
    hits (courtesy of Bob Beeman); Clarke Blacker's guitar fries like some methed-up Robert Fripp,
    spewing white-hot hate. Just as malevolent: ""Kill the Innocent"", a sludgy mess of migraine drums,
    melted bass, and Bruce Loose-styled wails about wading through the minds of two glue-sniffing mass
    murderers from Houston in the early 70s.  ""Take 'em home and perform deviant death tricks/ Rape 'em,
    wrap 'em in a hefty bag/ Bury them all in an old boat shed.""</p><p>
    
    From there the sound quality begins a slow descent into live boombox oversaturation, hiss, and

    late-breaking pan we're going to have to disappoint: Röyksopp are, ultimately, too beautiful to hate and
    too harmless to really love.</p><p>
    You might already be familiar with this Norwegian pair from their appearance on every downtempo or
    electronic pop compilation ever made. These compilations, which have spread across the recent musical
    landscape like mellowed-out and occasionally groovy dandelions, are basically the result of a few people
    noticing that slick-and-dreamy trip-hop and records like Air's <i>Moon Safari</i> could be appreciated by
    practically anyone: embraced by clubbers during their daytime hours, yes, and appreciated by ostensibly
    clued-up rock hipsters, but just as appealing to someone who never cared about being clued-up in the first
    place. All across the Western world, it was discovered, happy thirty-something couples with business degrees
    and Jettas could pick up free downtempo samplers at Crate &amp; Barrel and-- we might imagine-- enjoy Zero 7,
    Badly Drawn Boy, and housed-up Dido remixes while lighting candles and taking baths. People who find this
    horrible will recall Dirty Vegas' ""Days Go By"" and call it all ""music for car commercials,"" but on a certain
    level they're just being condescending and mean-spirited: People like this stuff because it's pleasant and
    reasonably interesting.</p><p>
    Röyksopp, you should know, are the heirs to exactly this lineage, having picked up the crown Air once wore
    and set it on top of creamy, accessible house music. Their own tracks are languid but funky, occasionally
    revving up into a friendly house throb and occasionally laying back into sunny crooning very much like
    <i>Moon Safari</i>'s-- I'm not completely convinced ""Sparks"" wasn't actually on that record.  Röyksopp's
    many compilation appearances are based in part on that, but just as much on their stunningly consistent
    string of truly amazing remixes-- a string that culminated last year with their getting inside the dauntingly
    singular world of The Streets, turning ""Weak Become Heroes"" inside-out into an ecstatic gush Mike Skinner
    would likely never have dreamed of.</p><p>
    The quality of those remixes is no surprise, because here's the thing: Röyksopp are master pop craftsmen,
    the Brian Wilsons and Burt Bacharachs of downtempo house. They know their tracks inside and out, from the
    subtlest sonic details, to the interplay of melodies, to the Big Picture build and flow-- and it's the pretty
    remarkable evidence of this on <i>Melody A.M.</i> that's endeared them even to many of those who think of
    themselves as being above easy-to-like compilation-fodder. ""Eple"", for instance, reconstructs vintage
    funky-drummer beats up against an addictively twinkly synth, all so enjoyably that it takes a while to
    notice details like the odd, rewinding stutter they've worked across several instruments. Or take ""In Space"",
    where loving little string swells drop off into achingly pretty harping while the remarkably complex beatwork
    ticks away bashfully in a corner. Call it new age pretty, Enya pretty, but hey: pretty is pretty, my friends.</p><p>
<i>Melody A.M.</i> is full of this stuff-- the stuff some people call ""sophisticated"" and ""organic,"" the
    stuff others might rightly identify as ""house for people who don't actually like house"" or ""ambient for
    people who don't actually like ambient."" The best moments, oddly, seem to come both from Röyksopp's devoting
    themselves entirely to this accessibility and from dropping their guard on it. On ""Röyksopp's Night Out""
    they allow themselves to break into a free-flowing and slightly less restrained darkness, just enough for
    you to wish they'd try their hands at a full-on rage; immediately afterward, though, they've erased that
    wish by assembling another shyly sunny patter for King of Convenience-turned-downtempo-crooner Erlend Øye
    to sing-song winsomely over. (""Poor Leno"", the album's most successful single, has Øye voicing a lullaby
    hook over a rich, subtly mutating, and equally charming groove.) The worst moments, unsurprisingly, come
    when Röyksopp go generically downtempo and then miss the mark-- witness the vocals on ""A Higher Place"".</p><p>
    The total package is, by any measure, a flagship release: This is likely the most solid, confident, and
    generally pleasurable downtempo full-length you'll be hearing for a while. Whether that means it's a
    must-buy, more well-meaning nondescript bubbling, or end-of-the-world car-commercial music has to be left
    to you. My vote may not be the first of those options, but at times it comes reasonably close.</p></div>"|6860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6860-melody-am/|7.8|Nitsuh Abebe

    Matmos' new live album. Now that I've heard it, I'm filled with speechless understanding. This is not the
    kind of music you sell in stores, not the kind of music you play if people you love are nearby. It's more
    like what you'd use to mask the sound of something horrible going on next door, like the frenzied mating of
    15-foot dragonflies, or a tank convoy being strafed by fighter jets, or the partial-birth abortion of a
    wild rhinoceros.</p><p>
    You might wonder what interest there might be in a live album by a band whose creates their music solely
    with elaborately programmed digital samples.  Fortunately, the band generally forgoes LP recreations in
    concert, opting instead for largely improvised music.  In fact, Matmos <i>strive</i> to keep things
    interesting onstage, to such a degree that fans may not realize what they're getting themselves into.
    <i>High, Live &amp; Dirty</i> captures the outcome of some of their live experimentation, such as: ascending
    speakers to the ceiling with the help of balloons (Paramount Theatre, Oakland, 2001), subjecting turkey
    calls to wholesale abuse (Union Chapel, London, 1999), electrocuting slinkies (KDVS, UC Davis, 1997),
    and doing something I do not want to understand with a bucket of oatmeal (KSZU, Stanford, 1998).</p><p>
    The San Francisco-based couple (Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt) is well-known for nestling their own raunchy
    universe of found sounds into glitched-out disco-bounce, and, some say, saving musique concréte from the
    dustbin of electronic music history. Notoriously, they'll go anywhere for a good sample, from the liposuction
    clinic to the sewer and back again. Usually, though, delightful sounds lurk close to home-- in inflatable
    blankets, for example, or records, whistles, insects, banjos, or crayfish.</p><p>
    In these live shows and radio spots, Matmos attempts to capture some of the sound-seeking adventure of their
    unique studio process, yet the result is strikingly <i>different</i> from their studio sound, not least
    because here the experimentation is wholly unhinged from any friendly dance grid: very few tracks feature
    Daniel's trademark moist, irreverent beats-- and the addition of hard-working genre assassin J Lesser to
    the wrecking crew will only serve to further alienate the Björk fans.</p><p>
    But what's exciting about these tracks is that moment when the distracted lab-jock feel of the onstage
    experiment begins to yield to the effortless discovery of a hidden song structure.  Yes, song.  No matter
    how vile the raw materials, these three listen for the hook and are ready to sweeten up the chaos when
    it finally emerges. Of course, this moment often corresponds to when the pre-sequenced rhythm tracks are
    dropped into the mix. It's a trick Matmos use all the time, and it almost always works.  Without this
    essential component, however, all you have to cling to as a listener is your associations. Better make
    them as free as possible.</p></div>"|5150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5150-live-with-j-lesser/|7.8|Jascha Hoffman

It's a
    reflection of everything that we listen to and the people we interact with.  We use 'dub' in our
    title because dub is a framework for experimentation, not just about reproducing a sound from a
    previous era.""  So says the liner notes from this reissue of Asian Dub Foundation's
    debut album, originally released in 1995.  It's an interesting assertion, and one I'm inclined to
    agree with.</p><p>
    
    True to that summary, <i>Facts and Fictions</i> does incorporate elements of many styles,
    but it really doesn't come across as eclectic, as every element is fully incorporated into a
    base sound that's fairly consistent from song to song, and, to a lesser extent, from album to album.
    You can hear the influence of dub in the way the music's put together; you can hear hip hop, jungle
    and bhangra in its rhythmic undercarriage, rock in the guitars, and traditional Bengali and
    North Indian music in the instrumentation and samples they employ.  The resulting mix is something
    incredibly unique and frequently arresting, but while their music may
    wear multinational tendencies on its sleeve, their lyrics are fiercely, proudly Indian.
    This is third release of <i>Facts and Fictions</i>, and it's clothed in one of the most thoroughly awful
    covers I've seen in years.  Yes it's the music that counts, but the artwork is
    inexcusable give that the label already had two better sleeves to choose from.</p><p>
    
    The Foundation coalesced at a music technology workshop for Asian youth in London, and
    quickly developed a political stridency based on anti-racism, displayed vividly in their
    lyrics, without much mincing of words.  Britain's large Indian population has long felt itself
    marginalized in their society, and not without reason, as the lingering haze of colonialism still
    refuses to fade away.  Vocalist Deedar ""Master D"" Zaman peppers his raps with lines like
    ""We're often told that this country's bursting at the seams/ But we're never told that there are in
    fact more people leaving than entering/ Immigration has become synonymous with black people/ Yet over
    sixty percent of immigrants are white,"" laying out his case in the plainest possible terms.</p><p>
    
    This is where we start to run up against some problems: at this early point in the Foundation's
    evolution, their righteousness was occasionally clumsy.  Read those lines above again; they may be
    true, and it's an alarming reality (revealing some rotten agendas), but, god, it's not exactly
    poetry.  On top of this, diction somewhat compromises the message Deedar strives
    so hard to put forth, due to his singularly odd mix of Cockney drawl and Reggae-influenced flow.
    The Foundation's lyrics occasionally seem to run at cross purposes as well, mixing messages like ""We
    are gonna/ Spread power with words,"" from ""Debris"" with lines that advocate violence against
    fascists: ""Time is getting short, elections in May/ Give the fascist man a gunshot-- that's the
    only way.""  I hate fascists, too, but this lowers the Foundation to the level of their enemies,
    and as a message, it's not constructive.</p><p>
    
    However formative the album is as a whole, <i>Facts and Fictions</i> still contains a few stunning
    moments, such as the media indictment refrain to ""PKNB"": ""The Sun [UK tabloid] has got its facts wrong
    and it's fucking up my day,"" delivered over a slowly morphing beat that creeps from slow and
    deliberate to driving and manic, with tabla loops keeping a constant pulse in the background.
    The single ""Rebel Warrior"" is the band's best early song, with its strangely calming swirl of keys,
    flutes, and sampled Indian singers forming a disarmingly comfortable backdrop for Deedar, railing
    against the final vestiges of British Empire.  Chadrasonic's guitar is given more breathing room
    than usual, and Deedar relaxes his delivery, becoming more intelligible without sacrificing his
    style.</p><p>
<i>Facts and Fictions</i> is an interesting look at where the Asian Dub Foundation got their start as
    politically-charged upstarts in the mid-90s, but I'd only recommend it to fans who don't already
    own it.  Newcomers are much better off going for either <i>Rafi's Revenge</i> or <i>Community
    Music</i>, albums that showcase the Foundation in full, amazing effect.</p></div>"|320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/320-facts-and-fictions/|6.4|Joe Tangari

They will     <em>all</em> be sold unless they can prove something to me, and quick.  I don't need the damn things cluttering     my pad.  <em>Englabörn</em>, with its pretty little Jon Wozencraft cover, didn't have a prayer.  But through     a series of accidents, the disc somehow slipped into repeat mode without my realizing it.  By the time I'd     caught the error, the album had played through twice, looping and breathing to life, its leitmotifs orbiting     the room in blissful, indolent circles, completely entrancing me.  This first solo album from Jóhann     Jóhannsson is absolutely beautiful, and it has only become moreso over the past few months, sustaining me     for long periods of time when other music just wouldn't do the trick.</p><p>Jóhannsson is a member of the Icelandic artist group Kitchen Motors, and aside from the fact that his     loose-knit collective has, on at least one occasion, held a concert for cellphones at their local Reykjavik     mall, additional information is scarce.  So I'll tell you what I know: Taking cues he provided to a stage     play by Hávar Sigurjónsson, Jóhannsson's <em>Englabörn</em> is composed of music he wrote, as performed by     the Eþos String Quartet, with a light gauze of electronic processing applied to it.  Although it's difficult     to ascertain any obvious tweaking in the end result, there is just a slight haze in the air surrounding     the sounds, letting the notes levitate and linger.</p><p>It begins innocuously enough with an AppleTalk voice reciting Latin scribe Catullus' poem, ""Odi et Amo"".     An intriguing selection of text, the poem addresses the agonizing extremes between devout love and consuming     hate.  To have this very human poem delivered by a droid tenor reveals all sorts of counterbalances at work:     gentle, nuanced music that soundtracked a brutally violent piece of theatre, these acoustic, classical     string quartets mixing with digital alchemy, and an ancient voice coursing through the latest in Speak 'n'     Spell technology.  It somehow balances beautifully, graceful in all its gestures.</p>
<p>Some of the pieces, like ""Karen býr til Engil"" and ""Eins og Venjulegt Fólk"" recall the similarly melancholy     electronic touch that infused the most desolate moments of Radiohead's <em>Kid A</em>.  With subtle, digital     rumbles, poignant glockenspiel, and scarce violin sustainment, a dreadful space surrounds each note, allowing     the music to resonate deep inside of you.  ""Jói &amp; Karen"" is exceptionally restrained, the piano moving like     droplets off of slowly melting icicles, and the violin breathing warmth from above.  The hesitation of each     breath and falling bead feels as though it were a Morton Feldman piece condensed to three minutes.</p>
<p>""Sálfrædingur"" is the most propulsive of the set, sounding like classic Moondog, with shaking rattles,     percolating drums, and stately piano.  Its counterpoint is ""Sálfræðingur Deyr"", where the theme is recast     with bowed strings, the bass solemn in its slow movements.  As the violin shivers against it, Jóhannsson     reduces it all to scarcely whispered vibrations.  This resonates into the music boxes and small squeaked     brass of ""Bad"". ""Ég Átti Gráa Aesku"" recombines the processional percussion from before with the earlier     refrains of piano into a more majestic statement, while ""Krókódíll"" recapitulates the downward movement     of piano notes of the opening theme, this time with the voice replaced by profound organ drones.</p>
<p>By the time of ""Odi et Amo - Bis"", which slows the original recitation to the point of near stasis, each     computer tone and bowed note is stilled to the point of absolute zero, the echoes reverberating off of     the ice.  A rememberance of things past is conjured up as chilling ghosts float in the ether.  The emotional     strain is apparent with these haunting last moments, though the music remains elegant and elegiac.</p>
<p>Just as Catullus balanced the extreme emotional opposites of love and hate into a composite whole the     greater of its parts, so does Jóhannsson transform these sixteen miniatures into an exquisite listening     experience.  With the slightest of movements, and in a handful of descending notes, a shivering gulf of     sadness is conveyed.  It's easy to mention something grandiose, but to fully expound upon this subtly     gestured work of music is far more difficult a task.  While <em>Englabörn</em> remains out of reach with     these words, the music continues to enrich.</p></div>"|4274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4274-englaborn/|8.9|Andy Beta

    more than other folks.  This piece of (seeming) common sense sometimes
    gets lost in the shuffle when discussing the effects of music: It's often
    described in similar terms as a natural disaster-- ""it moved me""; ""the music
    blew me away""; ""it destroyed all my expectations"".  Thus, the creators of
    the stuff are indirectly positioned as only semi-mortal figures, working
    ""magic"" with our hearts and souls-- or worse, the cult of celebrity claims
    their bodies entirely, elevating what was probably a humbling creative
    experience into the work of gods.  And while that pays excellent tribute
    to the mysticism of inspiration, it probably distances the artists from
    the rest of the pack (i.e., us) more than necessary.</p><p>
    
    Bob Drake plays distant music (literally, from the south of France), but
    apparently takes no pleasure in abstractions that might, in the hands of
    a lesser musician, quickly alienate an audience.  An abashed fan of
    olde-thyme pompasaurs like Yes and Uriah Heep, he rarely shies away from
    extroverted splashes of sound, be they cacophonous guitar solos or wailing
    vocal harmonies.  Yet, these moments seem less like flashes-in-the-pan than
    merely broader strokes on his palette.  In fact, where you might expect his
    songs to erupt into classical arcana, his underlying forms appear to be
    closer to traditional folk, albeit murder ballads and nursery tale night
    beasts.  It's almost as if Drake's relentless attention to detail and
    humility, even when obscured by a few layers of feedback, keeps whatever
    pretensions he has in check.</p><p>
<i>13 Songs and a Thing</i> is Drake's fifth solo record, and continues in a
    similarly eclectic vein as last year's excellent <i>The Skull Mailbox and Other
    Horrors</i>.  However, where that album was a song-cycle of short stories,
    <i>13 Songs</i> doesn't have a running narrative to tie it together.  Fans
    of his work shouldn't be disappointed, though, as per usual, there is no
    mistaking his sound.  The opener ""Chase"", written by Dominic Frontiere (theme
    composer for the 60s horror show <i>The Outer Limits</i>) and arranged by Drake,
    would actually fit well on the last album, as its frenzied, claustrophobic
    terror is hammered home via an aggressive acoustic guitar jag and nervous
    violin.  It's a junk symphony that would make as much sense coming from Tom
    Waits as Danny Elfman.  Similarly, ""Ten for a Dime"" uses intricate guitar
    figures and bowed double bass to create an atmosphere not far from an Alfred
    Hitchcock soundtrack, yet Drake's later juxtaposition of strange bluegrass
    riffs and Mellotron-soaked goth place it in a realm of his own design.</p><p>
    
    Acoustic textures lend understated warmth to most of this music, as do the
    omnipresent trad-American folk references.  The fractured waltz ""In Case the
    Insulator Fails"" could almost be an outtake from <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou</i>
    were it not for the offhandedly dissonant asides from violin and electric
    guitar.  It leads into the brief ""Griffin"", which is musically akin to Bela
    Bartok's take on The Beatles' ""I've Just Seen a Face"", but detailing Drake's
    erotic fascination with a museum statue places it well outside either folk-pop
    or modern classical music.</p><p>
    
    The most striking moments on <i>13 Songs</i> come when comparisons are much
    harder to make.  ""And the Sun"" is a gorgeous piece featuring distant classical
    piano and a barely audible gauze of ambient noise, punctuated by random bursts
    of radio static.  It's an almost perfect realization of almost forgotten
    mental imagery, as if years of life and music have obscured the original
    beauty of the piano music-- and in fact, Drake notes that part of the piece
    was recorded in the early 80s.  Guest vocalist Dick Verdult carries both
    ""Foam I"" and ""Rtuuf"" with throaty Spanish, and lends the former tune elegance
    not far removed from Paul Simon's buoyant work on <i>Graceland</i>.  Of course,
    Drake throws in a cavernous echo and expansive, almost overburdened arrangement
    of deep bass and primal, thudding percussion to knock it off center.  And then
    there's ""Building with Bones"", aka ""A Thing"": an epic backbreaker that sounds
    pretty close to the ground beneath my house caving in for about 13 straight
    minutes.</p><p>
    
    Despite repeated demonstrations of idiosyncrasy and an apparent dedication to
    turning left when a right is expected, <i>13 Songs</i> is hardly an exclusive
    experience.  I'd argue that Drake might even be approaching a hybrid of folk
    and avant-garde music that includes the most engaging characteristics of both
    without ever really betraying one for the other.  Maybe that leaves him alone
    in music circles (though I might make similar claims for the aforementioned
    Simon and Waits), but should be all the easier to pick his brand of noise from
    a crowd for listeners.  Sometimes it doesn't pay to look for links to the
    outside world, and his tunes are inviting enough that it may never occur to
    you to do so anyway.</p></div>"|2441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2441-13-songs-and-a-thing/|8.3|Dominique Leone

    Picking up where we left off: I've decided that my crush on the mayor's wife has something to do with the
    mayor's being an Ivy Leaguer. My attraction to her is, gulp, rooted in the way her gruff composure silently
    upbraids his foppish kewpie-dollness.  Another loose end:  I think the frenzied dreams about mannequin-luvin'
    are based on anxiety about needing new clothes, instead of the myriad less reputable interpretations.
    Incidentally, I hope you don't think it's rude that I don't ask how you are doing; it just always struck me
    as insane, when I snuck reads of others' diaries, that they began, ""Dear Diary, hope this finds you well?"",
    etc.</p><p>
    So I've got to review a Cynthia Dall CD for Pitchforkmedia.com, that e-zine that is fast becoming a cultural
    monolith as bristling with flash and bias as Fox News. I'm torn, Diary. You see, I dig her other work, but
    this... not so much. And it's on Drag City, a label so singularly wily, foxy, hip, outré, and haute that I
    find myself allotting their releases a different kind of attention than I would, say, a release from Atlantic.
    If Matador and Merge are the Monitor and Merrimack of big indie labels... well, I don't know where that
    leaves Sub Pop, since Washington wasn't a state during the Civil War.  Okay, new time period: Drag City is
    like H.L. Mencken, a lovable pariah, a smug beacon of intelligence and contrarianism, even though Mencken
    was from Baltimore which ruins the geographical thing I had going with the Northern Matador and the Southern
    Merge. The point is, I feel a pressure to wink knowingly at Drag City releases, to which I'll admit extending
    a kind of insecure sympathy. I remember pretending I didn't hate Flying Saucer Attack's <i>Distant Station</i>,
    and even feigning that I ""got"" King Kong, huh-huh.</p><p>
    So basically I suck? But maybe, Diary, I was caught in the pull of Drag City's communal, give-us-a-hand-here
    vibe; the label is (yes, another analogy) a veritable Brook Farm (K Records being the Branch Davidian compound)
    where everybody helps everybody and where all the crime scenes contain the leavings of an O'Rourke, or a
    Murphy, or a Hagerty.  Dall herself first surfaced as a kind of ""lovely assistant"" to Smog's Bill Callahan.
    Her distinctive guitar work (a top-heavy, distorted, amateurish staccato attack that strikes back and forth
    from chord X to chord Y unchangingly) is easy to spot, and she did vocals on at least three releases, ending
    around <i>The Doctor Came at Dawn</i> in 1996.</p><p>
    That year, Dall released <i>Untitled</i>, on which she was
    accompanied by Jim O'Rourke and Smog.  The record was a fascinating slab of curdling darkness, and Dall
    came across as playfully bitchy with a hint of the sinister. No hipster's yuletide mix is complete without
    the song on which Dall repeats, over music that sounds like the test tube baby of <i>The Exorcist</i> and
    <i>Halloween</i> soundtracks, ""What are you buying me for Christmas?/ It better be good."" The album was
    soilingly fun, like being tickled with a bloody feather.</p><p>
<i>Sound Restores Young Men</i>, though, is frustratingly primitive, and thus monochromatic, which is a
    shame because Dall's had six years to work on her guitar. And except for when she actually emotes on ""Nest
    of Dead Children"", or when she calls to mind <i>Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons</i>-era Blonde Redhead on
    the great, tumultuous, eight-minute ""Snakeblood and Vodka"", her distant voice sounds like a flatter Juliana
    Hatfield, or maybe Frente! girl Angie Hart if she was a Yank on downers, or maybe soda brat Hallie Eisenberg
    auditioning for <i>Ophelia</i>'s hey-nonny-nonny freakout scene.</p><p>
    Some of the fragile waif stuff here might be a
    reflection of the back cover's note that the album is a ""study of a young woman struck mute after witnessing
    her mother's murder,"" but that may be a tease, since the packaging is covered in similar random bits a la
    the kings of cut-n-paste-n-scribble, (Drag City scions) Pavement.  Incisive and divisive lyrics, like
    <i>Untitled</i>'s about hating her body, are fewer and farther between here, though she gets a few good
    accusatory jabs in, such as this one from the jealous anthem ""The Party"": ""When you talk about her, I feel
    as if I'd been in her myself."" Dall careens from moments of precise imagery to patches of vague talk that
    recall, well, diary entries.</p><p>
    So Diary, I reckon that in the Pitchfork piece I'll just say something that sounds totally objective, like,
    ""Despite its pedigree, this album's spook-chick tone is very early 90s, very drama club doyenne, very Tori
    Amos and Throwing Muses."" I won't mention the mayor's wife or the mannequins, or anything that would fuel
    some ""I'm intimidated by aloof femininity"" double-standard argument. I'll just hope no one points out
    comparatively hypocritical stances I've taken on other minimalist mid-fi outings. God, I can still hear my
    third wife saying, as she was packing her bags, that my bookshelf lacked proper representation of women and
    that how that was ""a metaphor for our skylab,"" ""our skylab"" already being her metaphor for our relationship's
    arc of enthusiasm, then eventless orbit, then choreographed plummet.</p><p>
    I dutifully played Cynthia Dall's
    <i>Untitled</i> on the way to purchase bookshelf-democratizing tomes by Lydia Davis, Mary Robison, and
    Wislawa Szymborska. How's this for a last sentence, Diary, you truest and most charitable consort: ""<i>Sound
    Restores Young Men</i> is fundamentally hampered by production that reduces Dall's role, on her own damn

    Reynolds. If you've heard Seefeel, it's obvious that Reynolds' definition of
    the term didn't take. His version of post-rock described bands that started
    with a rock structure and instrumental set-up (guitars, bass, drums, etc.),
    but used these tools to create music that put more focus on rhythm and texture,
    as was more common in club music. Sometime around 1993, Jan St. Werner and Andi
    Toma of Mouse on Mars sent their demo tape to Too Pure because they admired the
    music of Seefeel, and I'm guessing that the title of this Too Pure EP collection
    is a reference to the band that brought them into the label's orbit.</p><p>
<i>Rost Pocks</i> collects material from five Too Pure EPs and adds one
    compilation track, and a number of these songs appeared on the duo's first
    three full-lengths (although usually in a different mix).  Of course, as
    one would expect from a band that relies heavily on technology, Mouse on
    Mars had a different sound eight or nine years ago than they do today.
    When I interviewed Jan St. Werner for Pitchfork in the spring of 2001, he
    used the word ""shy"" to describe Mouse on Mars' early music.  I take his use
    of the word ""shy"" to be something like ""subtle"" and ""polite."" Early Mouse on
    Mars was about simple, hummable melodies and sonic detail. From the start,
    the duo programmed their modular synthesizers to create their trademark and
    much-emulated squishy sounds, but they wouldn't begin experimenting with
    more aggressive tracks like ""Actionist Respoke"" until later. Only ""Bip"" here,
    which was extended for 1995's <i>Iaora Tahiti</i>, really ups the tempo,
    with flurries of breakbeats; the bulk of the tracks collected on <i>Rost
    Pocks</i> drift by on a mellow, dub-inflected groove and memorable tunes.</p><p>
    
    One distinguishing characteristic of Mouse on Mars that was apparent from
    the start, despite their rightful classification as an electronic group, was
    their disinterest in building tracks from a series of repeating loops. It's
    always been their policy to vary the tracks slightly through the repeating
    sections. Their songwriting method at this time was informed by rock, which
    might explain why their audience is populated by a large number of rock fans.
    People dance at a Mouse on Mars show, but the event is much closer to a rock
    experience than a night at a club. It's not really DJ-informed music, though
    tracks like this compilation's ""Schnick-Schnack"", which features the women of
    Stereolab as they collaborated on the <i>Cache Coeur Naif</i> EP, anticipate
    the microhouse that would develop as the 90s wound down.</p><p>
    
    Speaking of <i>Cache Coeur Naif</i>, three of the four tracks from that EP
    appear here (""Glim"" is missing, but that was borrowed from the group's 1998
    vinyl-only LP <i>Glam</i> anyway), and they're all very good, and make me a
    bit nostalgic for when I first heard them.  But more than anything, they make
    me pine for this era of Stereolab, right around <i>Dots and Loops</i>, when
    Werner and Toma were producing some of their tracks. The Mouse on Mars pop
    sense always made sense next to Stereolab.</p><p>
    
    Another thing Mouse on Mars had from the get-go was a first-rate sense of
    humor. The IDM end of the electronic music spectrum has a rep for darkness,
    nihilism, and impenetrable abstraction, but Mouse on Mars during this time
    felt very comfortable being light, funny and playful. ""Twift"" sounds like
    the theme for a cartoon cop show, some sort of Hanna-Barbera version of
    <i>Dragnet</i>.  <i>Iaora Tahiti</i>'s ""Saturday Night World Cup Fieber""
    is really just a catchy, tuneful celebration of soccer (there's no way it
    could be anything more) and the two remixes of the track here highlight
    its simple pleasures.</p><p>
    
    I'm trying to put myself in the headspace of someone who hears <i>Rost Pocks</i>
    having known only <i>Idiology</i> or <i>Niun Niggung</i>. If you look to the
    band for melody and atmosphere, and don't view their music as a serious
    challenge, I would guess that <i>Rost Pocks</i> would be very much to your
    liking. It's certainly an excellent summary of those early years, and as an
    added bonus to those who dislike ambient house signifiers like the constant
    kickdrum thump that was all over the duo's 1994 debut, <i>Vulvaland</i>, the
    single mixes of these tracks are more pop-oriented, with live drums in place
    of the drum machine. If you're not going to get the three full-lengths from
    this period (which I would recommend), <i>Rost Pocks</i> is the way to go.</p></div>"|5458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5458-rost-pocks-the-ep-collection/|8.0|Mark Richardson

When he was doing millennial Mogwai promo at     Matador, he decided to lay it all on the line and proclaim the Incredibles the ""greatest band of all     time."" Of course it followed that Mogwai were ""the greatest band of the next millennium,"" so take each     decree as you will...</p>
<p>Regardless, the hungry dogs of hipsterdom were loosed on the Incredible String Band, and every dusty     copy of <i>The Big Huge</i>-- even the wretched <i>No Ruinous Feud</i>-- was snatched up for worship.     Elders like Robert Plant and John Lennon championed them in the past, and Boston folksters got     with them in the eighties, but their status came back to the fore recently, as No Neck Blues Band     and Avey Tare &amp; Geologist attached the ISB's stream-of-conscious meanderings to their noisy blurts.     Oneida even named a song after the group's girlfriends Rose and Licorice (a song since covered by     Liars).</p>
<p>As you delve into these Renaissance Fair backwaters, be wary: not all hold the same mystical powers of     whimsy. Favorites of thespian types that call each other ""Lord"" or ""M'lady"" on their three-day     weekends, the Incredibles pack a twee wallop into their fey tunes, enough to make Donovan or even     Belle &amp; Sebastian seem like leather-clad teddy boys.  It can be overwhelming to say the least. Once     you're stoned on it though, their peak output-- from '67 to '69, when <i>5000 Spirits</i>, <i>Hangman's     Beautiful Daughter</i>, <i>Wee Tam</i> and <i>The Big Huge</i> were released-- pours forth like the     nectar of the gods (fairground slang for a keg of Olympia).  There's nothing quite like their     fairy-dusted folk, blending disparate twines of mystical musings and quirky, naïf instrumentation on     a whim. These two reissues straddle that enchanted era, serving as bookends: before the Summer of     Love and after going 'clear' with L. Ron Hubbard.</p>
<p>Their first offering, from 1966, finds them still staid in their English folk roots. Springing from     the same scene as future British Isles legends like John Renborn, Bert Jansch, and Shirley Collins,     the group works as a trio, with soon-to-be-departed Clive Palmer pitching in for a number or two.     Strange as their folk may seem, heavy with flute trills, nasal croons, and flat-picked strings, it's     not ISB's strong suit, and their trad material-- ""Schaeffer's Jig"", ""Whistle Tune"" and ""Niggertown""     (""dusted with laughter powder"" as the notes say, those sick fucks)-- are tepid at best. To spice     things up, and stay way ahead of the academic multi-culti curve, they dash bits of Bulgarian and     Indian exotic fare into their songs. Incredible String Band is a bit incongruous, but within two     short years, the group would effortlessly weave in and out of all the world's music, with the deftest,     dreamlike ease.</p>
<p>The Dylan inclinations are a bit by the numbers as well, but that's expected with most     singer-songwriters of the age; the most interesting aspect of this album is that it documents the     nascent stylings of Robin Williamson and Mike Heron as they find their respective voices. Williamson's     romanticism is abundant (but vague) in ""Womankind"", and his keening voice expands and contracts along     with his strumming style, both coming as easily as mantra-breath. From such a seed arose the very     beautiful, personal ""First Girl I Loved"" (covered by both Judy Collins and Jackson Browne), and at     full blossom, the feminine-universe sprawl of ""Maya"", from <i>The Big Huge</i>.</p>
<p>Mike Heron's tunes follow along the same lines of natural growth.  ""The Tree"" reveals his self-induced     penchant for ""communing"" with Nature, capriciously talking to her, and her to he; this figment of fancy     grows to include all the other little animals of the forest, on the cute and curious ""Hedgehog Song""     off of <i>The 5000 Spirits</i>, and perhaps the Incredible's finest recorded moment, the folk-form     phagocytosis of ""A Very Cellular Song"".  Neither songwriter is quite there yet, but they both     lay groundwork in earnest.</p>
<p><i>Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air</i> is on the other side of the ISB bell curve, five years on, when     their moment has already passed, on a slippery slope downhill. All alchemical incantations are of     precarious balance: <i>Acrobat</i> is just a pinch or so off the mark, but it makes a crucial difference     for the internal chemistry at work. Tensions have mounted between the two main songwriters, Heron     leaning toward psychedelic rock, and Williamson trying to weave more theatricality into his     compositions. The lineup has changed, the girlfriends are gone, and everyone's playing headgames.     It's no Fleetwood Mac melodrama, but there's some audible discomfort.</p>
<p>Williamson's ""Talking of the End"" is a promising opener, a five minute showcase of what he does best     and most brilliantly, contrasting cringe-worthy musical elements and synthesizing them into something     holistic and magical. He effortlessly glides from gypsy violin to Eastern Liturgical mass choir, then     into some tambourine slap over a sitar solo before stirring in a dash of boy-girl folk levitation,     with countrified yelps and pedal steel.  It somehow coheres into the record's grandest moment, a     meditation on imminent apocalypse and the intimate personal bonds between two people.</p>
<p>If only it were all so effortless, so unforced, but it's apparent the group is grasping at straws,     hoping for the natural gold that once came so easy. Liquorice guests on a song-- her first appearance     in over six albums-- but it's obvious why she was relegated to harmonic duties: her voice is watery by     itself, wavering in a thick brogue on ""Cosmic Boy"".  They bring in a full drum kit for ""Painted     Chariot"", but it's mild, stumbling rock, with an organum interlude plopped in the middle for     continuity. ""Evolution Rag"" is downright awful, a funk fueled by mandolin plucks before it devolves     into a bog of kazoo, slide whistle, and roller-rink organ twaddle. The weaving of three traditional     jigs and one Williamson bit for ""Jigs"" shows they could still draw upon their roots, but ISB seem     estranged from so recent a past. They dig up Mike Heron's ""Tree"" from the first album, but it's     a half-hearted attempt to redress the song in a new swathing of piano, mandolin, and bazouki.</p>
<p>The Incredibles' true talent was sprawl, songs that spiraled into the double-digit mark, like ""Maya"",     ""Ducks on a Pond"", or my personal favorite, ""Creation"".  The ISB's incantations have more time to     take hold in these cases, but it a shame to find ""Darling Belle""-- the eleven-minute finale of <i>Liquid     Acrobat as Regards the Air</i>-- is cut of the same cloth as the disastrous double album of musical     theatre, 1970's U. Each member has a vague recitation, a part to play, but nothing coheres until     the very end of the failed piece, when the band is briefly beautiful, like the cover photograph:     half-obscured in the dark, wandering lost in the countryside, indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Blame it on a poor outing at Woodstock, on rising membership fees for Scientology (look what it did     to Chick Corea and Travolta!).  Blame it on parting ways with labels and longtime producer Joe Boyd,     on the tantric dissolution when Rose left the group, but the magic summoned by the Incredible     String Band in the late 60s quickly abandoned them. These two reissues play like dashed, crumbling     relics, only hinting at what the ISB were capable of in their prime.  Anyone intrigued by their     legend should look instead to what transpired between these two releases, when they may have     deserved the title ""the greatest band of all time.""</p></div>"|11760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11760-incredible-string-band-liquid-acrobat-as-regards-the-air/|5.9|Andy Beta

    need to latch onto a lost sense of dominant masculinity, the streets' unquenchable thirst for heroes, or
    simply a quest for a compelling urban narrative, hip-hop's obsession with the gangsta has dominated the
    genre for more than a decade.  It has resulted in political pundits-- many, it must be noted, with latently
    racist agendas-- dismissing the entire culture as violent, misogynistic, and ultimately destructive.
    Stylistically, gangsta is a mesh of Cinema Verite and action blockbusters, where the grime and moral
    ambivalence of the crack trade clash with the unmitigated bravado of playa anthems.  At its best, gangsta
    delves into these contradictions-- the pull between community and wealth, morality and survival-- with a
    deftness and wit alternately charming and horrifying.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i> rarely reaches these pinnacles; for most of the album's duration,
    50 wallows in the genre's clichés. The wit is sparse, the details are slim, and the threats are hollow.  This
    isn't as much a moral quarrel as it is one of thematic development.  Biggie came with the soul, Pac came
    with the charisma, L. had the wit, and Nas had the words.  But, with the exception of a few quality verses
    sprinkled here and there, 50 strikes as a parody of these masters, and does little on his debut to
    establish a persona of his own.  He doesn't delve into the character of the gangsta any deeper than the
    prosaism he spits, and while he obviously has an excellent vocal cadence and a finely tuned ear, his lyrics
    lack the textured imagery and dexterity of themes necessary to sustain interest over the course of a full
    album.</p><p>
    In perhaps his biggest misstep, 50 Cent eschews a world inhabited by real people doing real shit for most
    of <i>Get Rich</i>, instead relying on generalized threats, proclamations of invincibility, and calls for
    pussy.  Even the threats and declarations, bereft of the violent, pull-no-punches absolutism of Big L.'s
    early horrorcore, seem sanitized for Middle America.  To put it bluntly, 50's rap sounds cold and
    mechanical, as though he were paralyzed by the pressures of hype or the prospect of his album being used
    as evidence against him in his trial for alleged weapons possession; the album sees him alternately
    declaring that he cares/doesn't care whether the D.A. hears these tracks.</p><p>
    Yet, for all the flaws in 50 Cent's persona, <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i> isn't without its redeeming
    qualities.  For one, the album offers a handful of great singles (obviously: ""In Da Club"", ""Wanksta""),
    anchored by his distinctive, rolling drawl.  Loping beats and Caribbean Casios adorn ""P.I.M.P."" while
    50 flosses that misogynistic swagger; trigger-happy snares and organ punches cry out from the Dre-produced
    highlight ""Heat"".  Yet, none of the tracks touch his appearance on 1999's <i>In Too Deep</i> soundtrack--
    even while its fish-in-a-barrel attacks on virtually every platinum-selling artist of the last five years
    smacked of Eminem strategies, ""How to Rob (An Industry Nigga)"" factored heavily into the anticipation
    surrounding <i>Get Rich</i>, offering a glimpse of the juggernaut he might become.</p><p>
    In the meantime, the production work remains <i>Get Rich</i>'s strong suit, boasting contributions from Sha
    Money XL, Megahertz, Rockwilder, Kon Artis, and both Eminem's and Dr. Dre's crews.  Dre's team drops four
    tracks, each supreme examples of the raw ingenuity and virtuosity that, beyond the killer rhymes, made <i>2001</i>
    such a visceral, addictive party record.  He also proves that, though rarely as experimental as Timbaland or as
    self-consciously high-tech as the Neptunes, he can still drop a hit to rival either of them, and with half
    as many layers.  The bounce on ""In Da Club"" is straight-up irresistible, Dre at both his minimalist best
    and most deceptively infectious.</p><p>
    Still, 50 just isn't quite <i>there</i> yet.  Had he offered more tracks that showcased his talents quite
    as tangibly as ""How to Rob (An Industry Nigga)"" alongside the massive radio hits bumping from every
    inner-city Escalade, <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i> very well might have been the landmark achievement
    it's being touted as.  But as his character presently lacks the dynamism and depth required for that
    elusive gangsta magnetism that's a prerequisite for notoriety, 50 goes down as simply a decent MC with a

    but determined art-school trio with a penchant for Skin Graft-style noise-rock and aggressive live shows.
    It took them two years to get a record out, and when they finally did, it was released in a limited run of
    750 copies.  Since then, they've tightened up-- even dropping a member to become a bass/drums duo-- and the
    live shows which were once simply tenacious have slowly developed into juggernauts, atomic blasts of
    crystalline fury that send shards of feedback and blistering distortion into anyone who dares witness
    such savagery in the flesh.</p><p>
    
    2001 saw things quickly heating up for Lightning Bolt.  Their first nationally released full-length,
    <i>Ride the Skies</i>, set an impossibly high standard for the band, its tightly wound maelstrom of brutal
    aggression earning them instant acclaim as among the most punishing new art-rock bands.  But, in an unusual
    parallel with the early bands of 1980s indie rock, the record served mainly as a flier for their brain-damaging
    stage show, the main attraction.  The massive, chunky noise violence that emits from bassist Brian Gibson
    and drummer Brian Chippendale onstage makes for an intensely visceral experience.  Chippendale's vocals
    transmit via a contact mic rigged to his mouth inside a weathered, striped ski mask-- which, incidentally,
    was reduced to a mere shred of its former self by the third time they'd made it to my city last year.
    Their amps alone are about the height and size of a large-scale yurt, and when they're turned up all the
    way, the sound is both hypnotic and physically exhausting.  <i>Ride the Skies</i> conveyed that power,
    earning the band comparisons to Ruins, Boredoms, and even Slayer.  The bass came in clumps of crackled
    abuse, the drums clanged and thwacked with colossal precision, and Chippendale's searing, scorched vocal
    delivery was enough to blow holes clean through the most durable speakers at high volumes.</p><p>
    
    Suffice to say, Lightning Bolt have got quite a myth to uphold with their second full-length, <i>Wonderful
    Rainbow</i>.  One might expect this follow-up to either echo <i>Ride the Skies</i>, or diverge from that
    record's distinctive sound and collapse under the weight of its experimentation.  I rank Lightning Bolt
    in my top ten live experiences of all time, and I wasn't quite convinced they weren't just a one-trick
    pony, all flash and magic.  Fortunately, <i>Wonderful Rainbow</i> proves superior to its predecessor.
    Sure, there's less grating, scraping, and stabbing-- three traits that best defined their last LP-- and
    it may even disappoint those who love Lightning Bolt purely for the carnage.  But <i>Wonderful Rainbow</i>
    delivers what <i>Ride the Skies</i> most lacked: musical diversity.  Possibly taking cues from their
    psychic brethren and frequent tourmates Hella, Lightning Bolt have replaced much of their corrosive noise
    with throat-grappling melodies that are... actually kind of pretty, in a lacerating, destructive kind of
    way.</p><p>
    
    ""Crown of Storms"", a noodly, chugging prog anthem spattered with muffled hollering, and the quietly
    chirping title track, show Lightning Bolt dropping some of their incredible audacity to further embrace
    a clearly awesome sense of humor.  The result is something like a more contemporary, less D&amp;D-oriented;
    Blind Guardian; titanic, complex metal distorted by bass and kickdrum shrapnel.  The levity and melody
    lighten things up considerably, adding more energy and sparkling static, and making the band's traditional
    fist-throwing freakouts-- like the appropriately titled ""30,000 Monkies""-- resonate much more on the
    uptake.  Though already known for naked aggression executed with highbrow overtones, Lightning Bolt have
    gone even artier on us with <i>Wonderful Rainbow</i>, and by balancing their strong-armed aesthetic with
    unexpected dynamics, they're now proving themselves as artists with actual range, a band that can deliver
    beyond the novelty that got people talking; perhaps for the first time on a broad scale, Lightning Bolt
    will have them listening instead.</p></div>"|4786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4786-wonderful-rainbow/|8.4|Julianne Shepherd

    What if Radiohead got guitar-happy with U2-ish heft? What if The Flaming Lips stopped making nerd anthems
    for interplanetary Olympics? What if Mercury Rev included a post-Pixies scream-blast for every wince-worthy
    wuss-warble? What if Mogwai hired a vocalist who sounded like an imp cowering in an attic? What if Sigur Rós
    were a rock band already? What if Built to Spill were from Glasgow? What if Weezer and Björk hopped in the
    same teleporter and got blended into a grotesque, mood-disordered Brundlefly act?</p><p>
    Without an inkling of conscious mimicry, Aereogramme are almost the answer to these questions on their
    revelatory, if somehow pompous, sophomore release, a thunder-bunny of a long-player with ambition rivaling
    that of their fellow murderous Scot, Macbeth. In fact, they so gracefully shift from lilt to conflagration
    that you wish they'd team up with certain fellow countrymen to form the ominous low-end supergroup Belle &amp;
    The Bastards. I don't want to contribute to the way Aereogramme got typecast as a two-trick pony based on
    <i>A Story in White</i>, because they cease to be quiet/loud dualists on <i>Sleep and Release</i>, despite
    the hibernation-and-catharsis connotations of its title. In fact, the listener feels like a <i>Jurassic
    Park</i> lab technician unable to chronicle a wayward experiment's swift evolution; Aereogramme lurches
    spastically from dated electronica (cough, industrial) to rock to folk to symphony to--</p><p>
    The band purportedly was inspired by dark DVDs they watched on tour, resulting in what the press kit calls
    the album's ""deeply cinematic structure."" Whatever. That sounds like the logic of the film <i>Instinct</i>
    (a pajamas-and-vodka classic if you haven't seen it), in which Anthony Hopkins watches apes and therefore
    takes on their attributes. It's best if you avoid frontman Craig B's non-album musings; the didact tends to
    speak in manifestos that make his fans imagine Ian MacKaye wanting to change the world by starting Smashing
    Pumpkins. All you need to know is that this disc is hugely impressive and brimming with old-fashioned
    passion so earnest it's embarrassing, though occasionally the serene moments feel a li'l ziplocked, like
    a staged public service announcement of undying love.</p><p>
    Don't be turned off by the radio-ready production: In less than four minutes, ""Indiscretion #243"" sprints
    from its introductory straight-outta-<i>Doolittle</i> bassline, into a jam that would inspire a Social
    Distortion air-guitar stance in a comatose nun, then it permutates into a R.E.M-<i>Document</i>/<i>Green</i>
    breakdown complete with <i>Automatic for the People</i> organ, then it goes choral (!), then metal again,
    then it becomes an ambient piece with the first of many fascinating spoken-word samples (the best of which
    are a hyperventilating evangelist and an answering machine message that begs, ""Get in touch with me, please,
    please, I need your help""). Again, that's only the first song on a disc that intermittently sounds like four
    discs on shuffle, or a spliced talent/variety show at the coolest arena-themed bar in the world.</p><p>
    The optimism of the Fridmanniana can mask the despondent lyrics. At one point, Craig B sings, ""It's time to
    follow the black path/ Come tomorrow, you won't laugh,"" and then he adds, arrhythmically and all muffled,
    as if it were a useless afterthought: ""At love."" Elsewhere he intones, ""The reason we're all disfigured/
    I'll say it again/ The reason we're all disappointed/ Is innocence lost."" These are the better moments on
    a record that at (orchestral) times can be cheesier than a mattress full of feta. But all is forgiven due
    to the sheer ass-kick that predominates the rest. This band can compete with collossae of the current
    heavy-vogue such as Isis or Queens of the Stone Age; cue up or download ""No Really, Everything's Fine""
    right now and behold the guitars that reveal every cliched way that verbiage (""buzzsaw thud!"") fails to
    convey the adrenal onslaught of expertly multitracked axe-abuse. This song's chunky explosions are the
    holy mother of fuckscum scraped from the charred frame of the Ford Abomination, the SUV whipped up specially
    for Satan.</p><p>
    Okay, so I'm the first to confess that ""Yes"" is Everclear-esque.  Okay, so the unfortunate major-label
    grunge font on the cover does not do justice to a band who have upstaged their whole discography, even
    their Fukd-series disc for Chemikal Underground.  Okay, so ""A Winter's Discord"", in title and execution,
    is awful Queensrÿchian.  Okay, so the untitled finale is Mogwai doing a <i>Braveheart</i> score before it
    ends in a moist sizzle that suggests electric rain. Okay, so cynics will not get caught up in Aereogramme's
    sweep.  But the bold remainder of you, I envy. You're about to witness the aural equivalent of time-lapse
    tide changes. You're about to see where purgation and authenticity meet manipulation and spectacle.  I wish
    I could be you, hearing this CD for the first time, hosting the inner battle: ""Yo, this stuff's belabored.""
    ""Yo, this stuff's beautiful."" ""Yo, this stuff's pretentious."" ""Yo, this stuff's awesome.""</p></div>"|63.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/63-sleep-and-release/|8.5|William Bowers

Synth lasso'd in heavy, crackly chunks. Screaming, pained
    vocalist. Dark angles. It's what characterizes the disco portion of early 21st Century après-punk, and
    its elements are bound together by The Rapture, Hot Hot Heat, Dance Disaster Movement, GoGoGo Airheart,
    Chromatics, Headphone, Liars, Radio Vago, Numbers, Radio 4, et cetera, et al. You've heard it before.
    You've been hearing it for three years. There's no reason disco-warped dance punk shouldn't proliferate--
    it makes perfect sense. Come On got reissued. Dancing is fun. Neon is the new black. Now let's fuck shit
    up until the end of the world.</p><p>
    Only now, it's getting to be sort of obvious. While most of the above bands and their many brethren have
    some distinctive quality to separate them from the dance beat-wielding, underground-infiltrating masses,
    and some of them are even great, it's simply no longer that distinctive or special to simply play disco
    beats informed by hardcore and 80s new wave and goth-- which is why I'm not crazier about Seattle four-piece
    Hint Hint. They have all the elements to be unique, but first, they must learn to fuse those elements with
    grace, space, and diversity, 'cause right now, they near-methodically plow over every predictable aspect of
    danceable punk rock music.</p><p>
    It's not that <i>Sex is Everything</i>, the first record on Cold Crush-- a new label run by Dim Mak's Steve
    Aoki and Pretty Girls Make Graves' Derek Fudesco-- isn't enjoyable. Its six songs seethe with spiraling
    energy and tension between dual keyboards and guitar, while singer Peter Quirk lets out speedy, gravelly
    yelps like a steroidal Peter Murphy. (He even fronts British at times.)  On ""Rung by Rung"", cymbals crash
    hectically behind a certain Bauhaus steez, all gloomy low-end and cracked guitar. ""Among the Blind"" is a
    damaged punk number above church-bells tolling. The song's lyrics go, ""Buried alive all the time/ But the
    doctor said I'm fine,"" but could just as easily be, ""The line between the devil's teeth and that which
    cannot be repeat,"" for the speedy way they're sung. The creepy, downturned ""Plastic and Whores"" begins with
    a mediocre taste of electronic beats, but explodes in a melting battery of crushing noise, static, and
    blood-curdling screams. Later, the electronics redeem themselves a bit with a scratch-mocking sputter on
    the hardcore end of glitch, only to end impotently in a hollering, fizzled-out jam.</p><p>
    Individually, each song conforms to a similar tempo and explores virtually zero dynamic diversity. There's
    no breathing room for the melodies, so it sounds like a messy pile of molten, smoldering metal. This is a
    hindrance when their aesthetic is so similar to that of other bands, and makes their divergences-- that
    they're a little more hardcore, and like to sprinkle in the standard, rocker-using-ProTools beats and
    squelches-- not as significant on the whole.</p></div>"|3874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3874-sex-is-everything/|5.6|Julianne Shepherd

Jon Langford's voice, coarse and charming, opens     ""Drugstore"".  The Sadies' clean acoustic guitars are all country, but Langford's Welsh accent and that     hook in the melody hint at a pub ballad.  Langford's narrative is full of fleeting images both warm and     threatening-- from the date he's dragging onto the dancefloor, to some guy with a gun who's just walked     in, to the sharp air and hints of terror outside.  It's a night out at a bar with a seat inside Langford's     head, and The Sadies fit the words like a dress shirt that cost a week's pay and only comes out Saturday     night.</p><p>The bandname, Langford and ""His"" Sadies, is, of course, a friendly joke: The Sadies are their own outfit,     with several records to their name that hover around country/western but touch on everything from psych-rock     to surf.  They've also backed many vocal talents, from 50s R&amp;B cult singer Andre Williams to everyone's     favorite redheaded chanteuse, Neko Case.  Guitarist Dallas Good has even played with members of Shadowy     Men on a Shadowy Planet, Toronto's finest surf band.  As a support band, The Sadies know how to toe the     line, and with Langford they forgo any genre-bending or simple fooling around that might distract us.</p><p>So most of the music treads familiar ground, played well and only a little rowdy.  The Sadies stomp down     ""Up to My Neck in This"", on the lefty tirade ""American Pageant"" their guitars are brash and vicious.     Occasional member Critter shows up on vibes and percussion, putting extra resonance on ballads like ""Little     Vampires"", while guest Bob Egan's pedal steel-- especially gorgeous on ""Looking Good for Radio"" and ""Are     You an Entertainer?""-- adds a soar and shimmer that tugs the heartstrings.  The only thing that lets them     down are the songs.</p>
<p>These guys have plenty to say, but as the album plays, it becomes less captivating and more by-the-numbers.     Putting The Mekons and Waco Brothers singer Jon Langford in front of Toronto's rising alt-country stars     looks great on paper-- and typical for a disc from Bloodshot Records, the atmosphere's cozy and the playing's     impeccable.  Yet there are few sparks, and nothing is really exceptional.  Langford and the band wrote     all-new material, but it actually sounds less personal than if they'd stuck to good covers.  Even their     most exotic song, ""Shipwreck"", feels like just another dreamy lost-at-sea ballad.  (Though Sally Timms'     guest vocals sure are pretty.)</p>
<p>The most career-average contribution comes from Langford.  There's no doubting his cred in either rock or     alt-country, after twenty-five years of ""anything goes"" anarcho-rock with The Mekons and his work in cowpunk     band The Waco Brothers.  And while much has been made of whether his Welsh accent belongs in North American     country music, he proves yet again that his rough-timbred working man's rasp couldn't be more suited to     belting out songs about work, despair, and opposition to the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Langford gets angry, though here he only bares his teeth fleetingly, spitting out the horrific imagery of     ""American Pageant"".  He also gets sad, though he never hits a true gutbucket wallow; ""Little Vampires""     doesn't wrench the heart, nor does ""Looking Good for Radio"" feel like a deep admission of flaws.  (The     ""'Change must come'/ Can you break this twenty?"" line is just plain hammy.)  More than anything, Langford     comes off as a wayward if loveable uncle; his words are good but rarely cutting, and by the closing number--     ""Are You an Entertainer?"", a song about the grinds of the touring life-- the album itself has ground to a     halt.</p>
<p><em>Mayors of the Moon</em> is in no way a bad record-- every performance is solid and the recording sparkles--     but it doesn't quite meet its potential.  The challenge of this collaboration seems to have driven everyone     involved to make safe decisions instead of taking risks or letting in a little sloppiness, and that's the     last thing you'd expect from these guys.</p>

    there were some determinedly antagonistic inventors. The equation, as it's presented, is that punk
    rockers only knew three chords, while these New Yorkers, who became known as part of the nihilistically
    monikered no wave genre, didn't know any.</p><p>
    
    The five or six years during which this approach thrived were remarkable, and the sense of community
    and frustration that permeates the music is beautifully singular.  This was a group of people who
    came to success in an ass-backward way, and in ideal cases, never compromised their artistic
    integrity.While many of the artists survived, a good percentage of their material did not; the
    credibility of the movement rested squarely on the shoulders of hipster paragons like Sonic Youth
    or the Atavistic imprint, which has released some choice no wave records in its time.</p><p>
<i>Irresistible Impulse</i> is a strange idea for a box set, but it is convenient. As of early 2003,
    there has been no reissue of the legendary <i>No New York</i> compilation from 1978; while the
    Eno-produced compendium has bled into the preservative fabric of the Internet, you can't buy this
    once hugely influential album at your local record store.  Most of the artists on <i>No New York</i>
    have their own releases available, but the most oft-cited, seminal release from this critically
    lauded era is blatantly ignored, probably for prohibitive or indeterminate licensing costs.</p><p>
    
    With that limitation, Tiger Style decided to release everything it could license from James Chance's
    catalog, over four hours of music on four CDs filled with the violent, off-kilter dance music he's
    legendary for (though none of the Chance contributions to <i>No New York</i> are included).  Chance's
    band The Contortions were the most rhythmic group on <i>No New York</i>, yet removed from a myopic,
    too-academic view of the scene-- placed against the backdrop of their contemporaries in Lounge Lizards
    and Kid Creole &amp; The Coconuts-- there is certainly a visible context for this work that, judging from
    the liner notes, Tiger Style might want you to forget about.  Still, the post-dated posturing can't
    downplay Chance's significance: On <i>Irresistible Impulse</i> we can view his work for what it is,
    filled with sheer anger and contempt, qualities neither of the aforementioned groups could bring to
    bear, infused with a modicum of funk and soul.</p><p>
    
    The first two discs are the recently out-of-print, much-praised <i>Buy the Contortions</i> LP and
    James White &amp; The Blacks' <i>Off White</i>, with added live tracks from other previously released
    (though hard-to-find) live albums. These records seethe with rancor, and call to be heard: From the
    first song on <i>Buy the Contortions</i>, ""You're Useless and There Are No Excuses"", to the more
    subtle snubs on <i>Off White</i>, revolving around race, monotony, and sex, the real surprise in
    this is how antagonistic Chance is towards himself.  By the time he adopts the persona of James
    White, he's made perhaps one of the most painfully self-aware gestures in modern rock and roll,
    on par with Lou Reed's ""I Wanna Be Black"" from 1978's <i>Street Hassle</i>.  Chance looks at
    himself in the light of American music, seeing himself for what he is, rather than what he
    pretended to be. This is what made the no wave: It's not the winking, arty pretensions of the
    music, it's the revelation that Chance was simply trying to make soul music. He wants to be a
    thief, a crooner, a wailer, but he doesn't have the skills or pedigree.</p><p>
    
    Following incredible live tracks from <i>Soul Exorcism</i>-- including a prickly cover of
    Michael Jackson's ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough""-- <i>Irresistible Impulse</i> begins a steep
    decline. Tiger Style is stretching the endeavor thin: While <i>Buy the Contortions</i> and
    <i>Off White</i> are unique, powerful albums, Chance is simply not substantial or diverse enough
    to merit over four hours of investigation. Even if he was, one would need more coaxing than the
    gushing liner notes can muster. The two remaining discs of the set take Chance releases from the
    early 80s, and signifying the fizzling out of his once provocative music. You almost want Chance
    to reach out of the stereo and push you away, or turn it off.</p><p>
    
    Neither <i>Sax Maniac</i> nor <i>The Flaming Demonics</i> are particularly bad, they're just so
    goddamned unassuming. Singing about spending money, or covering a dull Ellington tune is fine;
    it reaches where Chance was heading, aping a simple love for Black American music, but the parts
    of Chance that were amateur, exciting and combative are gone.  The attitude and angst that made him
    a cult figure are replaced by eight-minute songs, heavy on process and pondering, not only
    studio-sterile and mundane, but tediously drawn-out. Still, there's something endearingly trashy
    about a song like ""I Danced with a Zombie"", even if it isn't as sharp or brilliant as ""Stained
    Sheets"".</p><p>
<i>Buy the Contortions</i> and <i>Off White</i> are simply fantastic albums, hugely significant
    in the progression of underground sound, but unfortunately they appear doomed to further obscurity
    thanks to their restricted availability on this overstuffed $40 dollar box.  A four-disc set
    doesn't make James Chance's art any less wonderful or valid, but it diminishes the resonance of
    his finest works; context is a huge part of what makes this music special, and given theirs, Chance
    and The Contortions don't need to stand up for more than two albums to ensure they're counted.</p></div>"|1397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1397-irresistible-impulse/|7.6|Kim Shannon

    harder today than it was in the 60s.  He said that back then, there probably
    weren't 20 great bands in the world, so it was much easier to cover the
    scene comprehensively.  I'd say he was reducing the issue a tad (especially
    in light of sets like <i>Nuggets</i>), but there is a kernel of wisdom
    in his observation.  In 1967, Jimi Hendrix almost single-handedly rallied
    troupes from rock, pop, blues, jazz and soul on both sides of the Atlantic
    with his psychedelic call to arms, <i>Are You Experienced?</i>.  In one fell swoop,
    he united the sounds of acts ranging from James Brown to The Beatles, and
    proved that young black men had as much a claim to rock's budding
    authenticity as any English mop tops.  This could never happen again, as ironically,
    people like Hendrix contributed to a splintering of scenes and sounds that made
    common threads almost impossible to find (or wind) thereafter.</p><p>
    
    In the wake of that fertile era, rock historians penned millions of words
    in hopes of connecting disparate dots into a clear lineage.  You know the drill:
    Hendrix begat Earth, Wind and Fire, Can and
    Led Zeppelin, who in turn begat everyone from Bad Brains to Lauryn Hill to
    Pearl Jam.  The holes in this reductive reasoning-- all too common in the post-Creem,
    post-Rolling Stone world of music journalism-- becomes apparent when you realize
    that hey, there might have been more than twenty good bands way back
    when, and wow, people were coming up with all kinds of shit in their free
    time.</p><p>
    
    One crucial moment, almost always glossed over, is the short-lived Black Rock ""scene""
    of the late 60s and early 70s (only occasionally in cahoots with Black Power); you'd figure
    that, coming immediately after Hendrix, bands like Parliament-Funkadelic, the Bar-Kays
    and the newly rockified Isley Brothers would seem obvious parallels, and accordingly, they're
    the ones always brought up in such discussions.  However, bands from all over the place
    were shooting for the very same synthesis of American countercultural music that Hendrix
    did were all over, as the mysterious compilation <i>Chains And Black Exhaust</i> strives
    to document.</p><p>
    
    Without a track list, artist mentions or liner notes, the Memphix crew (a
    collective of DJs and funk 45 junkies spearheaded by Dante Carfagna) attempt
    to set the record straight on black rock, psychedelia and
    funk, releasing this seventeen-track comp on Jones (a sub-label of their own
    Memphix Records).  The sound is on the exact same, embryonic tip as
    Funkadelic's first record (if they'd had even less of a budget).  Hendrix's
    wah-wah makes several appearances, as does his stoned out vocal delivery,
    and the omnipresent direct-from-vinyl mastering gives it a vintage groove.
    Of course, it would have been nice to know what the hell I was listening to
    without resorting to major search engine detective work, but for the most part,
    it's a stone jam of such proportions as to render the confusion part of the
    experience.</p><p>
    
    The first half of a great bit captured from a radio talk show (""it's the
    color man, and the monthly payments, you know what I mean?"") opens the
    record, and leads directly to Blackrock's ""Yeah Yeah"".  Piano and guitar
    drone set the stage for badass kung fu stomp, courtesy of molasses-laden
    drums and bass, both doing their best to max out the mics.  An
    acid-fried guitar solo elevates it into the Hendrix/Eddie Hazel
    stratosphere.  Likewise, Iron Knowledge's ""Showstopper"" takes Hendrix's
    patented quivering fret trick (on bass, no less!) and slaps down an anti-war
    jam so infectious, the singers can barely stay on key during the chorus.
    OK, in truth some of these bands were less than polished, but the spirit is
    always there.</p><p>
    
    ""Life Is A Gamble"", performed by Preacher, Doug Anderson's ""Mama, Here Comes
    the Preacher"" and Hot Chocolate's ""What's Good for the Goose"" are prime
    slices of black rock, and would have sounded completely at home on
    Parliament's <i>Osmium</i> LP (""shooby dooby, bang bang, brotha's gotta groovy
    thang""), or one of the early Ohio Players records.  The former tune features
    a break so potent a crossing of <i>Band of Gypsies</i> and a porno soundtrack,
    Westbound Records should pay them back royalties.  Gran Am's ""Get High""
    represents the raw end of the spectrum here, as the band overdub their
    vocalizing of the title over and over, threatening to bury the drums
    completely.  On the other end is Curtis Knight's super-tight ""The Devil Made
    Me Do It"", which is an excellent mix of <i>Superfly</i> pulse and almost pop,
    classic rock hooks.</p><p>
    
    The lesser tracks play it closest to standard funk, such as the Kool &amp; the Gang
    spunk of track 4, or the funky Getaway music of track 14-- of course, I have no idea who
    I just dissed, but so goes limited pressing, semi-bootleg funk comps.  There's a rumor <i>Chains and
    Black Exhaust</i> will be reissued next year with recording info and track
    listing, but for now, Jones is your connection.  It's not as if there are
    loads of other comps with this stuff out there, and until somebody gets off
    their ass and issues those early Funkadelic records in a decent mix, you
    need this.  Shit, you need it anyway.</p></div>"|1911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1911-chains-and-black-exhaust/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    the overweight lover Heavy D in the same song, back to back.  Both references seriously represent for
    the ladies, and when Acey's extrapolating on the hotness of his ""Dirty Birdy""-- who's ""So flirty/
    Comin' out the house lookin' all nice and purdy,"" he sounds more shook on lovin' than LL Cool J.</p><p>
    
    But the entirety of this longtime Freestyle Fellowship/Project Blowed emcee's persona is defined
    by his smoothness, as both an emcee and a lyricist (not that the two are-- or should be-- separable).
    His reclined, effortless flow is represented well on <i>Hip Hop and the World We Live In</i>, a
    compilation of tracks recorded from 2000-2002 with Elusive of the Living Legends (soon to be
    better-known after Def Jux releases a new record from crew member Murs). Though <i>Hip Hop</i> was
    made sporadically, within the same time frame as <i>Accepted Eclectic</i> (2001), it's a more consistent
    offering, without the weaker tracks that kept <i>Accepted Eclectic</i> from exceeding the comfort of
    ""classic"" and approaching the realm of ""masterpiece."" While <i>Hip Hop</i> doesn't necessarily launch
    Aceyalone into those circles either, it's a good, solid example of the art of rhyme. As always, Acey
    excels at his craft.</p><p>
    
    As proven on earlier Aceyalone-Elusive collaborations, these two boys were made for each other.
    Acey's ""Got the ease/ Cool as a breeze,"" and Elusive backs it up with a layered, laid back shuffle of
    thick, consistent beats, inserting subtle elements of 20th century jazz and classical samples (flute,
    upright bass, cello, etc) whenever possible. It's somewhat freaky, twinkling darkly with distant
    skronks, deeply up front melodies, and scary piano lines that sound ripped from the deepest recesses
    of Henry Cowell, Gyorgy Kurtag, maybe even Mike Oldfield. None of that happy-schmappy, edgeless
    nu-jazz piano noodling here: this is purely ominous stuff. It especially works on standout tracks
    like ""I Think I Know Too Much"", in which Acey's authority and anguish is conveyed in a heated list of
    thoughts that clog his brain: ""Holidays/ Sorrow/ No one is guaranteed tomorrow/ Yesterday is
    borrowed/ Picture-perfect sunsets/ Ocean-front toxic waste dumps/ I think I know too much/ (You don't
    know shit!)""</p><p>
    
    Aceyalone is at his best when he's rapping in precise, simple polyrhythms (occasionally on a feelin'
    fine, Stetsasonic/De La vibe), proving that an emcee doesn't have to emote into oblivion to sound
    personal,
    nor does he have to rock fifty-cent words to sound intelligent. Throughout, he conveys a smart
    toughness, still speaking out against the bling and the thugs, while lauding a kind of humility in a
    battle rhyme: ""The bigger they come, the harder they fallin'/ All I wanna know is why your man got so
    much ego?""</p><p>
    
    The million-dollar question, then, is whether Acey's next release will launch him further into the
    public eye; after all, he's been a force in the L.A. underground since the late 80s, his fans are
    loyal, his records are numerous, and he's widely considered a strong talent. He wonders this himself
    on ""Say"", the now-obligatory, frustrated rant against the mainstream hip-hop machine: ""The question
    is how could a man like me/ Actually be/ A man that's free / Of speech and the ability reach the
    masses?/ Maybe I should refrain and let the unimaginative, non-creative ones give me some brains?""</p></div>"|16.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16-hip-hop-and-the-world-we-live-in/|7.5|Julianne Shepherd

    rock and roll left. Of course, straight renditions of Willie Nelson wouldn't do, so they went for the darker
    side, for Johnny Cash, taking the drunken outlaw rather than the church picnicker as their role model.
    Uncle Tupelo won some big victories, as did Whiskeytown.  Now Canyon is taking their shot, and though
    they've accomplished a lot less than those two bands thus far, they have yet to implode, which gives
    them a big leg up as the competition continues to thin out.</p><p>
    
    On their second album <i>Empty Rooms</i>, this elusive group infuses their country leanings with more
    exotic sounds, to the point where it sounds like they've forgotten the way to Nashville. Only the most
    hidebound purist would find this objectionable after hearing the best of the results, which find a way
    to balance disparate elements precariously enough that their lovely hybrid seems forever on the verge
    of collapse.  The meticulously assembled guitars deserve full credit for this: When combined, they form
    a nuanced wall of sound that borders on feedback without ever crossing over. Instead of exploding like
    the Velvet Underground's axes might have done, Canyon lets their squall sit at a distance, like a storm
    cloud that can't decide whether to erupt or slink back over the horizon.  ""Sleepwalker"", ""Head Above"",
    ""Blankets and Shields"", and possible Television allusion ""Magnetic Moon"" all achieve this queasy sense
    of foreboding, denying the release of climax and resolution. They develop tension and leave it there,
    and if Canyon gets credit for nothing else, they should be saluted for delving into perpetual tension,
    an underpopulated section of pop music's emotional spectrum.</p><p>
    
    If justice prevails, this will not be the only thing that nets Canyon praise.  Their sense of
    orchestration shows an admirable willingness to let vocals be swallowed up by other instruments; the
    lyrics are heavy on loss and alienation, but they let their music do the real talking, which is a
    bracing choice in this never-ending age of Bono-styled rock prophets and inspirational speakers. The
    weariness and resignation comes through clearly enough, but it does so with an adult dose of ambiguity,
    knocking a phrase off balance with a drum fill or a growling amp.  It's this kind of mystery that
    outlines the best moments on <i>Empty Rooms</i>.</p><p>
    
    After such flashes of inspiration, it's understandably disappointing when Canyon lets up on the gas.
    When they're not diving headlong into unknown waters, they're busy cranking out straightforward
    country rock ballads whose lack of imagination isn't at all disguised by overt electronic frou-frou.
    They still put a great deal of care into these songs, as the precision guitar rattle on ""Lights of
    Town"" shows, but these numbers aren't inherently exciting enough to compensate for their
    conventionality. There was a natural opening on <i>Empty Rooms</i>, for a comforting counterbalance
    to the reckless experimentation they had going, but Canyon fails to fill it, at least with any original style.
    These unearned anthems are a repeatedly embarrassing albatross, marring a steady, slow-burner of an
    album, one you'd hardly expect to find sullied by impatience and second-guessing.</p></div>"|1288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1288-empty-rooms/|6.9|Brian James

    one Heather McIntosh.  Members of Neutral Milk Hotel, Olivia Tremor Control, Circulatory System, Music
    Tapes, and Elf Power have all contributed, striving for the demented carnival feel of Tom Waits circa
    <i>Swordfishtrombones</i> and <i>The Black Rider</i>, alternately. They have an obsession with the sea
    that goes beyond lyrics or song titles like ""My Ship"" and ""Sea Chantey"": The entire album sounds like
    it was played on the deck of a galleon creeping slowly through the night on calm waters. That gentle
    swaying-- adrift on an endless expanse of ocean-- resides at the core of <i>Billions of Phonographs</i>.
    Its tension comes from dense harmonies and plodding rhythms, not anxiously anticipating disaster,
    but insistent, and focused on the ship's...instruments.</p><p>
    
    Bordering overwrought, the complicated pieces will knock a few curious listeners off the Instruments'
    boat, but those with a thirst for detail should delight in McIntosh's intricacy of arrangement, made
    simultaneously more complex and naturalistic by the established, well-traveled collective
    that support her.  The songs shuffle along, taking their time to develop, giving the impression they
    dictate the agenda to the musicians, rather than the other way around.</p><p>
    
    It's is an intriguing approach in small doses, but taken at length, it's hard not to wish someone from
    the vaunted cast would firmly plant their spurs in this pony.  <i>Billions of Phonographs</i> manages
    to slip into the background more often than one might expect given that it features such novel
    ingredients as theremin, mellophone, and a singing saw.  Unfortunately, its vagueness is largely due
    to the fact that McIntosh isn't all that compelling as a vocalist, and when she puts together a harmony,
    she tends to overdo it, going too big, too loud, too overtly exotic.  Flying solo, her druggy delivery
    merely hovers rather than soaring or swooping.</p><p>
<i>Billions of Phonographs</i> would probably function better playing in a quiet coffee shop than at
    home over headphones, intently analyzing each note, despite the considerable craftsmanship that
    on paper deserves the latter setting. The two laudable exceptions to this estimation are found at
    albums' end: ""My Ship"" and ""By and By"".  Here, McIntosh gets it right, double-tracking her vocals on
    the first and offering a gorgeous adaptation of a J.R. Webster theme on the second.  Acknowledging
    the chaotic, overstuffed material many of the contributors are infamous for, <i>Billions of
    Phonographs</i> is surprising in its direct emotional consistency; the players are able to subdue
    their egos and focus on their muse, but she's unable to answer their prayers, delivering sustenance
    rather than bounty.</p></div>"|4106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4106-billions-of-phonographs/|6.7|Mark Martelli

In only two and a half years,     he was propelled from an awkward, computer-programming teenager with a Jazzmaster and ugly glasses to the     prototype for chic geekdom.  Virtually overnight, he established himself as among the most articulate     songwriters rock music has ever seen, infusing punk with the literacy it had always strived for but rarely     achieved.  With superstar status and a reputation for pushing the envelope, Costello was able to crystallize     the thematic threads of political and personal devastation that ran through his first two records into the     concept of ""emotional fascism,"" the original title for <i>Armed Forces</i>.</p>
<p>Though <i>Armed Forces</i> is in many ways the most conceptually aggressive and confrontational of Costello's     first three records, it doesn't carry with it the same immediacy of his first two releases, 1977's <i>My Aim     Is True</i> and 1978's <i>This Year's Model</i>, on which he came as a man with something to prove.  There's     something intensely subversive about <i>My Aim Is True</i> with its undercurrents of anger and frustration     providing a foundation for his synthesis of pop melody, country twang, and punk energy.  <i>This Year's     Model</i>, meanwhile, saw Costello expanding his sound significantly, with each instrument coming through     as clear and urgent as a warning siren.  It was equal parts whispered confession and frantic street corner     sermon, and though he never quite reached its apex again, <i>Armed Forces</i> comes very close.</p>
<p>As Costello writes in the liner notes to this expanded reissue, <i>Armed Forces</i> marks the first time     that he was actually aware of his audience.  Perhaps in an attempt to elucidate the web of veiled and     convoluted social and personal references running through his first two records, the album is lyrically     much more general, and remarkably self-conscious, right from the opening lyric, ""Oh, I just don't know     where to begin.""  This, of course, doesn't slow Costello down-- ""Accidents Will Happen"", one of the finest     songs in his, or any, repertoire, matches a signature smirking double-entendre with an almost Baroque pop     sensibility.  Melodically and lyrically, the song is above reproach, as Costello sings of infidelity with     what could either be construed as regret or smug satisfaction.  It's also one of several songs on <i>Armed     Forces</i> to benefit from the album's dense production.</p>
<p>Whereas both <i>My Aim Is True</i> and <i>This Year's Model</i> are sharply produced, relatively sparse     affairs, <i>Armed Forces</i> is extravagantly layered with dense instrumentation and rich, effusive textures.     Pete Thomas' maniacal drumming is much more consistent than on previous outings, and keyboardist Steve Nieve,     for the first time, is as likely to be found at a piano as behind a synthesizer.  On ""Accidents Will Happen""     and the similarly stunning ""Oliver's Army"", in which Costello winds catchy and elegant melodies around     slightly off-kilter chord progressions, the production works to the record's advantage, filling the songs     out with bombastic power-pop arrangements and giving weight to their urgency.  ""Big Boys"" and ""Green Shirt""--     two subdued products of the same mold that produced ""The Beat"" and ""Pump It Up"", and make full use of steady,     insistent rhythms and the unstoppable kinetic energy of The Attractions-- are near-classics as well, but     are somewhat hindered by the album's smoother production.  An earlier acoustic version of ""Big Boys"" included     as a bonus track on Rhino's reissue of <i>This Year's Model</i> reveals layers of anger and heartbreak that     the album version buries beneath impenetrable four-part harmonies and a heavy fog of reverb.</p>
<p>Of course, even if the production on <i>Armed Forces</i> often serves to conceal, rather than reveal the     nuances of Costello's songwriting and The Attractions' always impeccable playing, the songwriting can     hardly be argued with.  ""Goon Squad"" carries on the menacing tone and complex rhythms of ""Watching the     Detectives"" and ""(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea"" with a prodigious sense of melody; ""Party Girl"" is yet     another example of Costello successfully executing what would, in the hands of a lesser musician, quickly     strike as overwrought; ""Moods for Moderns"" turns disco cliché into new wave brilliance; and a fiery, acidic     cover of Nick Lowe's ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding"" mockingly closes an album packed     with dauntless, condemnatory social commentary.</p>
<p>In the end, the greatest strength of <i>Armed Forces</i> may be the same thing that makes it less viscerally     powerful than Costello's two prior records-- its songs absolutely demand to be appreciated for their     craftsmanship.  In many ways, <i>Armed Forces</i> can be seen as the point at which Costello dropped the     role of angry young upstart, and became more comfortable with his personification as a songwriter.  And     considering that he has since remained largely true to this sound, it can be seen not only as the     consummation of all he had worked toward, but a window to what he would later accomplish.</p></div>"|1621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1621-armed-forces/|9.5|Matt LeMay

Name one place.  Really try.  I promise, he's been there.
    Supermarket?  Sorry, aisle 13 flashes issues of <i>People</i> and <i>TV Guide</i>.  Post office?  Nope,
    no less than four copies of <i>You Can Feel Me</i> have shown up in the Pitchfork P.O. box in the past
    two months, each accompanied by glossy 8x10s and novella-thick press kits.  DMV?  Great guess, but he
    even showed up there last week when I stood 74th in line wearing headphones blasting Loyola University's
    WLUW.  <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Spin</i>, <i>CMJ</i>, MTV, ABC... BET!!  You guys, BET.  How did this
    art-school joke from suburban Minnesota get all that publicity?  The guy even co-wrote songs on Kelly
    Osbourne's debut and took her to the VMAs.</p><p>
    Har Mar Superstar, as you may know by now, is Sean Tillmann, who got his start fronting the Amphetamine
    Reptile noise-pop band Calvin Krime.  Not long after that group disbanded, he re-emerged with a new project,
    Sean Na Na, and his self-titled Kill Rock Stars debut as Har Mar, which, initially, he jokingly passed off
    as the work of a younger brother, Harold Martin.  (The name, in fact, comes from a notoriously dilapidated
    strip mall in Roseville, MN.)  But during the past three years, Tillmann's been thinking bigger.  Not
    content as simply the latest successor to the indie rock oddity throne of The Frogs, Wesley Willis and
    Neil Hamburger, he's taken his rote R&amp;B; caricatures to Warner, who've flung him headfirst into the 15-minute
    novelty spotlight that once shown on Tenacious D, The Jerky Boys and Green Jellö.  And so he finally lives
    up to his moniker.</p><p>
<i>You Can Feel Me</i> is, predictably, a much glossier affair than Tillmann's Har Mar debut, and, in
    keeping with current trends, its instrumentation is far more minimal.  Other than that, not much has
    changed.  But what could, really?  The entire persona's a joke, a sorta-funny-on-paper gimmick that wears
    out its welcome about three seconds after being made a reality.  I mean, it's so obvious!  A pudged-out,
    freakishly ugly white dude crooning soul cuts in his underwear?  How'd this guy get a record out at all,
    much less one with such little actual entertainment value?</p><p>
    I'll tell you how: America.  The country's no-brow simpletons lap this shit up like a last meal.  It'll
    sell for the same reasons <i>The Man Show</i>'s lasted four seasons and Spencer Gifts can't keep inflatable
    tits and farting monkeys in stock.  What are we, nine?  <i>You Can Feel Me</i> only exists as a passing gag.
    It's an off-color joke we forget after flicking off the TV.  And the label doesn't even try to disguise
    that the disc is pure merchandise, from its 29-minute runtime to its budget list price.  They <i>know</i>
    no one actually wants to listen to this.  People see the funny fat man on TV, they click to Amazon.com.
    It's that easy!</p><p>
    If these tracks had even the slightest shred of originality, it would be one thing, but Tillmann's on
    autopilot from the moment we push play.  <i>You Can Feel Me</i>'s entire comedic arsenal consists of
    his off-key falsetto, and stock R&amp;B; catchphrases that were already played-out when his debut hit stores
    in 2000: ""I'm all up in your grill"", ""baby mother"", ""all you haters, step the fuck off,"" ""I ain't got
    nothin' but love,"" ""tappin' that ass"", ""ungh, ungh,"" ""put ya hands up"", and ""booty call"" are just <i>some</i>
    of the tired colloquialisms we're expected to laugh at.  Did I mention there's vocoder?  Hilarity!</p><p>
    Weighting this thing against other novelty records-- where a 10.0 might be, say, Spike Jones' <i>Nutcracker
    Suite</i>-- is a total loss; <i>You Can Feel Me</i> couldn't even battle 30 seconds of ""They're Coming to
    Take Me Away, Ha Ha"".  The melodies, which are incomprehensibly being touted as this record's secret weapon,
    might be worse than the humor.  This guy is shopping songs to Eve and J-Lo?  Get the fuck out.  What PR
    flack got promoted for that one?</p><p>
    Oh, and did you know Har Mar really takes this all <i>very</i> seriously?  Did you?  Check his quote from
    Canada's <i>Eye Weekly</i> in December:</p><p>
    ""I'm not mocking it at all!  I don't understand why people fucking think that.  Because I'm white?  Everyone
    has this perception that I'm mocking it because I perform and I do it with a straight face, but that's
    because I fucking love it.  If you're going to laugh at it, fine, but buy my fucking record.  The whole
    mockery issue really pisses me off, I think it's really retarded.  If you put Usher's face on the cover
    nobody would know the difference, and I can sing better than that motherfucker.""</p><p>
    Yeah, Tillmann, it's because you're fucking white.  Jesus!  Can you even believe the arrogance of this kid?
    Is he an asshole or something?  Sorry, champ, but Usher wouldn't package promotional copies of his albums
    with gross-out glossies of his fat ass in thriftstore Underoos.  Usher wouldn't play up his rank beastliness
    by neglecting his personal grooming habits before photo shoots.  Usher wouldn't sport a cop-show 'stache and
    a rat-tail mullet.  I can't even believe that needs to be explained!!  ""Because I'm white?""  How do you even
    sleep after making a comment like that?!  DUDE YOU HAVE A SONG ABOUT <i>THE FUCKING ELEPHANT WALK!!!</i></p><p>

    and Practices to emerge from behind my radiator and make me say it.  And, oh no, here they are. (They have
    eyes that make dogs shiver-- and who'd have thought corduroy and epaulettes would go so well together?)
    The applicable by laws are firm on this point: If I don't say it, they can revoke my turntable and all of
    my Peel Sessions. So here you go: ""The Italian Kraftwerk."" It was either that or mentioning those ""Sprockets""
    segments from <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.</p><p>
    
    I think they're gone now. So yes, N.O.I.A. were Italian and sounded basically like Kraftwerk. And while they
    supposedly scored a few popular singles during the mid-80s in their home country, a good portion of their
    earlier work went unreleased. Two years ago, however, they went back and re-recorded some of those songs,
    and now Ersatz Audio-- Adult.'s label, and one I'm pretty fond of-- have offered up these ""unreleased classics.""
    At least two or three of them, you'll be glad to hear, are just mind-blowingly fantastic, really ridiculously
    enjoyable.</p><p>
    
    All of these tracks were written between 1978 and 1982, in Italy, which might lead one to expect a discful
    of vintage Italo-disco, packed with dark enveloping swells and ominous grinds. But N.O.I.A., as noted, were
    under the spell of Kraftwerk, not Giorgio Moroder. So what we get is quite different: The precise, minimal
    beeping of synths and brittle little drum machines, mapping out gridlike streams of ultra-robotic pop so
    sterile and simplified that its funkiness can feel like a treasure. It's jerky and twinkly and sometimes
    adorably groovy: All you need to enjoy this is to be the sort of person who'd find watching a big wall of
    multicolored LED lights blink in repetitive patterns at least as entertaining as, say, watching grass grow.
    Because, you see, the Kraftwerk in question here isn't just Kraftwerk in general: it's the well-known
    Kraftwerk of <i>Computer World</i>, the Kraftwerk that, depending on whom you ask, either descended into
    amusing self-parody or finally matched their playfully rigid robotism to the context of stiff little pop
    songs.</p><p>
    
    There are a few tracks in this collection that make it seem as if nothing else is even worth doing. One of
    the best is ""Be Alert"", where a cutely formal groove breaks down into a tight, yelping verse before shifting
    gears and cruising back round again.  It's one of the most ingeniously plotted things I've heard in a while,
    and I'm sure that if you downloaded it you'd only be doing that to tide yourself over until you could attain
    it legally. Another winner is ""Stop Thinking"", which does, well, sort of the same thing, only with more of
    a ""Peter Gunn"" rhythm: It's the vocals here that prompted that really unfortunate <i>Sprockets</i> reference,
    with their clipped delivery of questions like, ""Don't you know your mind's too much slow?"" and repeated
    proclamations of, ""You must stop thinking!""</p><p>
    
    Tracks like these function as spazzy pop as much as Kraftwerk and Devo did, thanks in part to a certain
    carefree quality: On ""Korowa Milk Bar"", they even reconfigure that classic rock 'n' roll four-step harmony--
    you know, the one from ""Twist &amp; Shout"". Seven tracks later, they're offering ""grazie mille"" to Kraftwerk
    and paying homage with synth-speech reworkings of their songs, ""The Robots"" mutating lovingly into ""We Wanna
    Glow"".</p><p>
    
    Obviously there's plenty of futurism: much talk of traveling in electric wheelchairs and computers making
    ""No Mistakes"". Interestingly, there's also Cold War politics: ""Stop Thinking"", for instance, is followed by
    the presumably less sarcastic ""West Is the Best"". (You can trust central Europeans to make more realistic
    moral distinctions about communism than Americans, who've never been allowed to take it seriously enough to
    form very enlightened responses.) Following that is ""Hunger in the East""-- a song about, well, Social
    Darwinism-- whose message has only grown more pertinent a couple decades on: ""Selection now means hunger in
    the East."" If you've listened to many synth records from this period, you'll be unsurprised to hear there's
    a song about Japan, only in this case it's called ""Nagasaki Forced Fun 1945"".  You'll also be unsurprised
    to hear that this collection is a bit monochromatic (duh) and contains a bunch of cute beepy synth patterns
    that repeat a whole awful lot. If this sounds unappealing to you, it's safe to assume you're not a part of
    the target audience.</p><p>
    
    So: I used to go around trying to convince people that Men without Hats' <i>Rhythm of Youth</i> was the best
    example of this kind of music that I'd come across-- and before you laugh, be aware that most of that record
    sounds as much like Gang of Four as it does ""Safety Dance"".  But the best of these tracks (""Be Alert"", ""Korowa
    Milk Bar"", ""Stop Thinking"") are currently getting a lot more spins than much of other stuff in my bedroom.</p></div>"|5825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5825-unreleased-classics-78-82/|7.4|Nitsuh Abebe

'Cause I wanna get one going.  Seems to me there's a new movement
    a-brewing in the electronic music province, a newborn taking up residence somewhere between the scene's
    dancefloor boogie and IDM compositional chin-stroking.  Heralded by fantabulous 2002 albums from The Notwist
    and Max Tundra, a new sound arose combining accessible pop melodies with the cutting-edge of computerized
    music technology.  As far as I know, however, nobody's come up with a name that's stuck on the donkey yet,
    so I'm volunteering my own.</p><p>
    
    Lap-pop.</p><p>
    
    Okay, right, sounds pretty awful right off the bat, I realize.  But chew on it a bit, give it a few spins
    around the noggin, picture it on a record bin namecard.  Yep, still awful.  But all genre names are, aren't
    they?  Which gives me the confidence that this one just might stick, and be applied to the increasing flow
    of releases to which it might apply-- be it the near-toothache of The Postal Service, the smoove stylings
    of Super_Collider, or the bait-and-switch opener of Hrvatski's <i>Swarm and Dither</i>.</p><p>
    
    And now, Pulseprogramming, who, should my creation gain popularity, would most adequately be referred to as
    run-of-the-mill lap-pop.  ""Blooms Eventually"" tips their hand right off, with that most lap-poppy of devices,
    the vocoder-- you know, man, machine, the voice modified by technology, deep stuff.  Despite the manipulated
    voice (w/vocodorized harmonies, even), synthesizer squiggles, and handclap hits, it's a rather melancholy
    affair more akin to a less organically grounded Notwist.</p><p>
    
    It's a mood that continues throughout <i>Tulsa in One Second</i>, although further vocal tracks misplace the
    vocoder and leave the voices au natural.  The singing rarely breaks out of a mopey drone, mourn-moaning
    through I Am statements on ""Stylophone Purrs and Mannerist Blossoms"" or drearily intoning ""Row Row Row
    Your Boat"" lyrics on ""Off to Do Showery Snapshots"".  Whereas other microphone collaborators in this movement
    bring much-needed emotion to the binary codes of IDM-- Ben Gibbard brightening up the digitalia of Dntel,
    Max Tundra's sister verbalizing his amino-acid obsessions-- Pulseprogramming's lack of affect leaves their
    traditional songcraft sounding somewhat hollow.</p><p>
    
    Not helping matters is the fact that Pulseprogramming's music is strictly blunt-edge, full of glitchyclickybuzzy
    noises that sound tired even to this electronic music skimmer.  The lack of freshness is most apparent on the
    disc's instrumental tracks, most of which sound like hand-me-down versions of the micro-carols on Mum's
    <i>Finally We Are No One</i>.  Only when the more driving bassline of ""Largely Long-Distance Loves"" breaks
    the album out of its tick-tack trance in the final act do the duo of Marc Hellner and Joel Kriske start to
    sound like more than a cut-rate Matmos, setting the stage for the majestic closing build of ""Bless the
    Drastic Space"".</p><p>
    
    Still, even that final burst of electronic chopwork behind a catchy vocal is par for the course on the
    Postal Service's full-length, and proves that Pulseprogramming are a few lengths behind their peers.  You
    might think I'd be upset with <i>Tulsa for One Second</i> for mucking up my freshly christened genre with
    a subpar release, but I'm not worried-- every new stylistic branch needs its mediocre releases to fill out
    the ranks.  As for the possible spread of my squintingly terrible new genre label (remember kids, lap-pop!
    Use it in a sentence today!), don't worry, I can deal with the infamy.  Worked for Douglas Coupland, dinnit?</p></div>"|6513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6513-tulsa-for-one-second/|6.4|Rob Mitchum

    Knife became boring.  It was a subtle, insidious change that could have been the result of Greg Wales
    taking on production duties, or Chris Prescott's increasingly subdued drum work, but it might have
    been something far more sinister: a quest for accessibility.  The more polished No Knife
    are easier to listen to, but their shiny, post-punk-flavored morsels suit a wider variety of
    palettes because they're more agreeably bland.</p><p>
    
    The oddest thing is that on the surface, No Knife are improving.  Musically, artistically, and
    thematically, the San Diego quartet expanded their horizons on <i>Fire in the City of Automatons</i>;
    they slowed things down a bit, tried their hand at a few melancholy downtempo cuts, and still
    managed to bend the music to their aggressive, slightly-askew guitar rock aesthetic.  But it
    didn't quite work.  <i>Fire</i> lacked their singularly awkward, shambling gait, the rougher
    edges of their earliest recordings.  <i>Riot For Romance!</i> was their chance to stop bathing,
    shaving, and flossing, to slouch back into the unpresentable slack rockers we were first
    drawn to.  No such luck.</p><p>
    
    No Knife remains as clean cut as they were on <i>Fire in the City of Automatons</i>, maybe cleaner.
    Their signature, ragged hooks are still sharp, but no longer break the skin; the rhythm shifts and
    breakdowns cut on a dime, but they're weighed down by a sense that they've become gratuitous.  A
    passive-aggressive rut runs squarely through the center of this album.  Plenty
    of these tracks start angry, but they all cave at the end, in eerily predictable fashion.</p><p>
    
    The biggest miscues on <i>Riot</i> are songs that don't start at all, when No Knife explores their
    softer side, which unlike the more patient moments on <i>Fire</i> isn't touching, just squishy.
    ""Feathers and Furs"" is simply interminable: the same two chords are jangled back and forth until
    the end of time.  Occasionally, there's a downy, 12 Rods-styled chorus full of soaring harmonies and
    cymbal washes (many actually pretty good), but I promise you'll get cancer and die waiting
    to hear it.  ""May I Call You Doll?"" is, in isolation, <i>Riot</i>'s most inspired piece (aside from
    the title track), a delicate, sorrowful instrumental straight from the forests of <i>Twin Peaks</i>,
    but it kills the album prematurely.  The rush of energy that follows from ""Flechette"" seems wasted,
    and excess is the last thing this album needs.</p><p>
    
    Amazingly, ""Riot for Romance!"" is strong enough to carry this one through its bleakest
    points on its own.  The vicious, saw-toothed guitar line that staggers through the heart of this
    song is more fascinating and creative than the rest of the album doubled, then redoubled.  Along with
    the perfect mix of anger, desperation, hope and defeat in Mitch Wilson's vocals, the song
    possesses the strength to carry <i>Riot</i> through its stumbling, over-reaching tracklist.</p><p>
    
    Is it any wonder the highs almost perfectly counterbalance the lows on an album with such questionable
    aims?  No Knife has learned to balance on the fence such that everyone might be included: never too
    fast, never too slow, but never daring or much fun.  Perhaps year-round sunny skies and fair weather
    have finally taken their toll, but these guys need a knife now more than ever, to cut some edges into
    the encroaching, stifling gloss.</p></div>"|5815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5815-riot-for-romance/|6.6|Eric Carr

""Make It Clap"" is the worst
    21st century, radio-friendly hip-hop single since...well, what was your last single?  And what's
    worse, every two bit thug from Illadelph to San Fran thinks they've heard the pinnacle of
    dancehall flava 'cause they watched your ugly mug flash 8 million ivory teeth into a fish-eye lens
    on MTV.  Sorry to burst your shiny, gold bubble, but out there in the thick web of backwater 'burbs
    and ethernet cables are PC warriors who've taken the shuffling, bloodshot riddims of dub and ragga,
    the blitzkrieg verbal skills of various dancehall MCs, and turned that shit into an Extinction
    Level Event that'd have you pissing your sagging Bushi pants.</p><p>
    DJ Scud, Psychofreud, Knifehandchop,
    post-trauma Otto Von Shirach, Kevin Martin's The Bug project: Each one has severed dancehall's
    dreadlocked head and grafted it onto the body of their own brand of virulent breakbeat, from
    electro-gabba freak-outs to jungle doused in eleven rancid herbs and spices. In every case the
    whole transcends the parts, and disembodied Caribbean rants find new life as they forge through
    pelvis-shattering beats like mental patients sailing an endless sea of Ice-9.</p><p>
    And no one right now is doing it as well as Enduser, Kentucky's own and Jah's favorite. <i>15 Tracks</i>,
    his first full-length for Sonic Terror, is an S&amp;M; orgasm of unrelenting stereo violence, an
    amalgamation of ganja smoke, severed heads, and 18 tons of rusty nails that puts everyone else's game
    to shame.  Moving from head-bobs to bodyblows in the space of a few seconds, Enduser (that's
    end-user) takes cues from the aggressive cut-ups of Venetian Snares and Squarepusher, rolls them up
    in the cherry-scented skin of backpacker hip-hop, and lights that blunt with a butane torch until
    the sucker burns white hot. Be it nebulous drum 'n' bass or steel machete breakcore, Bounty Killer or
    Björk, Enduser dips it all in battery acid and Red Stripe, and ferments a barrel full of digital
    moonshine worth going blind to drink.</p><p>
    The opening round is a massive revamp of Meth and Redman's benign <i>Blackout!</i> cut
    ""Tear it off"", a clicking iron snare with eerie UFO landing themes that completely reshuffle the
    Brick City and Shaolin representatives around the beat. ""Blastin' Muthafuckaz"" brings in the thug MCs,
    packing stuttering handgun boasts, backed by drum kits made of steel beams and tin, but it's the
    cribbing of ragga verbals and melody-minded cadences that really spread the gasoline around.  The
    industrial, vibrating bed of nails, ""Beatdown"", and the bitch-in-heat fervor of ""Rprznt"" are whales
    unto themselves, but the chirping ""I Come From Cincinnati"" is as unreformed as it is a party record,
    a fire and brim stone buildup broken up by fuzzed-out bass drops and a coked-up flute, racing a gruff
    bear of an MC and his vampiress sparring partner.  Think D/J Rupture's <i>Gold Teef Thief</i> mix,
    drunk on Captain Morgan in an underground bunker, chased with Caribbean Drain-O.</p><p>
    There are faces here no one has tried on yet, or at least haven't looked as good wearing. ""East Side Breaks""
    plucks a long moan of senseless New-agey gibberish from what sound like a Deep Forest or Enigma record,
    and straps it lovingly on the back of a tranquilized sandworm, warming up the bed while ""Knuckle
    Fucker"" gets its ya-ya's out, a Commodore 64 riff in Wonka-vision, overpowered by cannibal breaks.
    ""Port 666"" has the most personalities: every barrage of bristling speed metal stomp and sliding
    digital hardcore comes at you like a bonafide headcase.</p><p>
<i>15 Tracks</i> is a better discovery than cheap cigarettes: it's hot sex, imported
    beer and Dutch Masters, a hot-glue strip search from Pam Grier, with coat hangers and paper clips
    jammed deep in your ears. You can keep your pastel fur coats, Busta. Are you ever gonna put fresh intestines
    wrapped in a shirt on your CD insert?. As much as you'd like to think yourself an innovator, you made
    your name in the wrong industry. Are you making it clap, Busta, or are you just passing that shit
    around?</p></div>"|2783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2783-15-tracks/|9.0|Mark Martelli

    To-may-to or to-mah-to, he's the newest cat on Mike Patton's Ipecac label, and this stateside debut of his

    Be they the disembodied voices of discarded Lou Rawls prototypes, the lost Juanita Rogers, or Brenda Lee's
    li'l sister, Kaada fidgets and squirms a lot while putting all these samples in a row, grafting them onto
    some doo-woppy pop art with a palpable Pixie Stix 'n' Pepsi sugar high. That energy can be endearing: When's
    the last time Conway Twitty sounded as fresh as he does on ""Care""? (Conway Twitty was my very first concert,
    so I think I can safely say ""never."")</p><p>
    
    ""Mainframe"" reiterates ad infinitum the peculiarly sweet metaphor, ""She is my mainframe,"" and is constructed
    out of a snippet of soft-dicked 70s funksters Climax, some harmonica, and a tribal pounding of tom and cowbell.
    It's catchy as fuck, even though there remains a weird plasticness to it all, like showroom dummies come to
    life to mack on you under the florescent lights of the neighborhood's new Polly Ester's. As queerly enticing
    is the klezmer clarinet, chord organ, and choppy guitars of ""All Wrong"", which drops a fetching Bee Brothers
    snippet in with samples of Kaada's previous group, Chloroform All-Scars. ""Black California"" resurrects the
    onomatopoeias of ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Surfin' Bird"", but it's not nearly as much mindless fun as it thinks it
    is. And if you can imagine a miniature Prince claymation figure (well, an inch or two shorter) crawling
    around your body and screeching out those despicable gospel hollers off his recent albums, you have some
    idea of the terror within ""Burden"".</p><p>

    Two things ultimately permeate <i>Thank You for Giving Me Your Valuable Time</i>: the odor of the cover art
    (it's far too easy to just say the liner notes stink-- they're actually a bit fishy smelling, like something
    caught in the East River, soused in chemical spillage), and the salesmen pitch of the title track.  For four
    minutes at the album's end, this pasty advertising suit grinds the title into your head: two-dimensional,
    stiff, trying to sell you home insurance and a refinanced mortgage even though you rent a loft space, and
    his heavy cologne just reeks.  So what can I tell you?  The disc is hit-or-miss to be sure, and all told,
    we find Kaada somewhat insincere despite his best-crooned efforts at the hard sale of wackiness, and a bit
    too eager to please.  Of course, some folks might be willing to look past that if these kinds of pastiches
    are up their alley, but this type of release not being particularly rare, I'd suggest you get your fix

First, the thing transcends its clunky name.  Then
    it transcends its ""for girls""-ness. Whuh-oh: By that I mean, well... you know what I mean.  The way
    <i>Yoshimi</i> was ""for girls."" And Jeff Buckley. Still good and all, just ""for girls."" That's no diss of
    lassitude-- in fact, the gender-reference is unfortunate; I was taught (by a girl! whew) that the phrase
    denotes a semi-precious, self-conscious quality, what proclaimed tuff-girls mean when they announce that
    they are dressed ""girly.""</p><p>
    
    Compare Leo DiCaprio's eyes when he was a serious young actor with the
    twinkle-googly eyes of <i>Titanic</i> and the rest, in which he is ""for girls."" Think of the way Conor
    Oberst poses for pictures, or performs, or does anything except Desaparecidos. And don't act like your
    scene lacks a contingent of people barely into music, who instead relish, as is their right in this freest
    of countries, a band's ""hotness"" or ""cuteness."" At some points on this debut, Summer at Shatter Creek is
    a Jeff Mangum ""for girls,"" especially when songs bust into pageantry/fanfare with the piano-led lonesome
    cuddliness of march music deprived of its procession.</p><p>
    
    And you know what ""F.G."" film director Summer at Shatter Creek sounds made tailor made for? Wes Anderson.
    Almost any song on Summer at Shatter Creek could slouch ethereally (however one does that) beside Elliott
    Smith and Emitt Rhodes on the soundtrack to the upcoming prequel <i>Episode 1: Look Who's Tenenbauming</i>.
    And dig the album cover's ornate frame of little-kid-type art: a perfect match for Anderson's fetishistic
    artifice-avalanches under which mature children and immature adults confound each other. Very ""F.G.""</p><p>
    
    By the way, Summer at Shatter Creek is one guy: a Craig Michael Gurwich out of Kalamazoo, Michigan. And you
    know what else he transcends? That one-guy-band thing. But watch out, Gurwich, because you come very, very
    close to owing royalties to Dump, the solo project of Yo La Tengo's James McNew, whom you kind of sing like,
    but sometimes better, and produce like (when Dump is produced) and who also adorns his albums with homegrown
    ""F.G."" toddler-kitsch a notch beneath <i>Hello Kitty</i>. Another neverlander to whom Gurwich is similar,
    in terms of tempo, guitar tone, layered elf-vox, and fractured Beatlesiana is: Tobin Sprout.</p><p>
    
    But Gurwich can't be stopped: He's on a rampage of transcendence! Because he also transcends that
    one-guy-band-that-sounds-like-a-huge-band thing. He's one of the best blends of lo-fi loner and Phil
    Spector aural huzzahdom I've ever heard. He's a bedroom Bacharach like Badly Drawn Boy, creating songs
    that trigger decades of pop reference points-- he's Edward Erahands.  ""The Essence of Time"" asks what
    if <i>Pet Sounds</i> was a more psychedelic collaboration between Skip Spence and a Jan &amp; Dean trapped
    in the phantom zone, burning incense blended with Elephant 6 ashes. ""The Drive"" is a drumless Zombies'
    ""Time of the Season"" if it were sung by cute zombies.  In fact, much of the album suggests a otherworldly
    and eerie, but cute, Goodwill in which an otherworldly and eerie, but cute, oldies station is being played.</p><p>
    
    Of course, some of the album's just prime indie rock, albeit on the mellow tip. The coed dreampop of ""I Don't
    Even Miss You"" conjures ""for girls"" classics by Slumberland bands Rocketship and Nord Express.  And speaking
    of slumberland, the disc tellingly thumbs it nose at Wilco and Hayden and other such indulgers by boasting
    the obligatory lullaby (""Go to Sleep"") as its fourth song. The juh-hamm of ""Home for the Holidays"" is a
    collision of squeaky-cleanery and Thom Yorke's morbid wail-- imagine a Disney sitcom called <i>Radiohead
    Meets World</i>.</p><p>
    
    Still more transcendence! The album's best song (""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"") transcends both the
    ailment-song and concerned-neighbor-song subgenres, trotting on the victory lap alongside Suzanne Vega's
    ""Luka"", Dogbowl's ""Growing Up in a Wheelchair"", Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control"", and sometimes Metallica's
    ""One"". This track best capitalizes on the album's ethic of transmogrification; most of the tunes burp or
    blossom into expansive second acts, but when ""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"" does it-- <i>yeeeow</i>.
    Gurwich goes from sounding like a detached artiste to belting out an ode to symbiotic suffering that
    reveals, via foil, the vulnerability of its speaker.</p><p>
    
    Insipid lyrics (example: ""When someone makes you feel like you are just shit/ They are not a friend"") and
    too-long buildups keep the album from galloping into the promised pastures of Eight Point Five Plus, but
    Summer at Shatter Creek's elegant horses can practically smell that realm's hallowed poop. I predict a long
    shelflife for this record, but mang, there's so much other stuff on that shelf to choose from...</p></div>"|7561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7561-summer-at-shatter-creek/|7.8|William Bowers

    Legendary Pink Dots have wedged themselves so firmly into their own specific niche over the years that it's
    unlikely they could leave it even if they wanted to.  In just over twenty years, they've kicked out nearly
    forty albums (live records and comps put them near sixty), and not one of those releases has ever seen them
    set foot into a realm you could call commercial.  While obscurity and difficulty certainly aren't virtues in their
    own right, the various lineups that have revolved around the core of Edward Ka-Spel and Phil Knight have
    always found oddness without much effort-- some of their best records (<i>From Here You'll Watch the World Go
    By</i>, <i>A Perfect Mystery</i>, <i>Chemical Playground 1 + 2</i>) revel in sounds that most would roll
    their eyes at.</p><p>
    
    And that's an important point-- most people will not like this music.  That's just fact.  The keyboards drip
    in sounds other bands avoid like the plague, Ka-Spel's lisping delivery can be over-the-top even for Goths,
    and huge swaths of this album are bathed with washes of sound that go places only when they feel like it,
    not when you want them to.  The band's closest kindred spirits in terms of approach (though not necessarily
    in sound), are darkwave acts like Current 93 and Nurse with Wound, though their music only occasionally
    reaches the points of creepy surrealism or abrasion that those artists aspire to.</p><p>
    
    And despite all this, there's something arresting about the music that Legendary Pink Dots make.  The band
    grabs you with a song or two, blinding you to the fact that you're being gradually lowered into a morass of
    strange, uncompromising sound.  In the midst of all this is the inescapable fact that Ka-Spel can't pronounce
    the letter ""r,"" a fact which will either drive you up the wall or endear you to him.  I have to say that
    after a brief period of adjustment way back in the day, I came to like his voice-- it nicely suits the music.</p><p>
    
    It's almost not worth getting into specifics about songs, as the whole record feels very much of a piece,
    from the weird synthetic opening to the droning club beat that guides the last thirteen minutes of its
    duration on ""The Brightest Star"".  Programmed drums and little whizzing noises serve as the bed for ""Cross
    of Fire"", which is about as appropriate a bowshot as you could have for what comes after.  Ka-Spel starts
    out at the back of the mix, before an army of buzzing devices lifts him on robot arms into the foreground.
    He still sounds like he's standing 20 feet down the hall speaking into a megaphone, but he somehow comes
    out ahead, at least before a guitar processed beyond recognition guts everything and leaves behind the
    artificial organ and string motifs of ""The Warden"".</p><p>
    
    ""The Warden"" is one of a handful of comparatively straightforward dirges that populate the wasteland of
    guitar and keyboard drone that fills the album's middle.  The drum machine is halfway between Enya and
    being switched off, the string patches are utterly fake and the tempo is molasses slow, but all of this,
    combined with Ka-Spel's dreamy intonations and some wandering, Leslie-coated piano, makes for something
    utterly unique and fascinating.  ""Sabres at Dawn"" is a broken-down carnival ride waiting to maim a child,
    while ""Touched by the Midnight Sun"" is disquietingly empty, plying only a few sparse drones and some
    water-like ambience behind Ka-Spel's disembodied zombie sing-speak.</p><p>
    
    The aforementioned closer picks things up at the end, and though its dance beat is a strong one, it's
    what's going on around it that's really interesting-- these sounds conjure images of clubbers being ripped
    to tatters by knives, splattering a blender load of distortion and whirring helicopter synths all over
    everything.  When it finally sputters to a halt after 13 minutes of punishment, you'll be ready to come
    back into the light.  It's difficult to say exactly who will like this, aside from those already along for
    the Dots' freakish ride, and saying, ""you'll either love it or hate it outright,"" though probably true,
    isn't very helpful.  So let me say this: Legendary Pink Dots are a singular musical experience, and if
    that's worth your money, have a fun trip.</p></div>"|4722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4722-all-the-kings-men/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    emanating from the Japanese countryside.  Born in 1941, he's made outdoor sound the focus of
    his career, constructing installations that transcend space and time, turning the outside world
    into a lucid daydream.  In 1997, Suzuki analyzed the French town Enghien-Les-Bains, precisely
    mapping out (with footsteps) areas where echoes were most resonant.  He built a simple concrete
    enclosure on the banks of their lake, designed to eliminate vision but maximize sound, a natural sensory
    amplifier with disorienting, very Zen implications.  Barely available on record, some of Suzuki's
    experiments are finally captured on this two-disc compendium available from Hören (most readily
    available in the US from Forced Exposure).</p><p>
    Most pieces grow out of wind-swept silence, sometimes gathering the force to transform into
    typhoons of feedback (see ""Howling Objects""), but most of this sound barely brushes across the leaves,
    turning all into Aeolian harps. ""Analapos '70"", named after an instrument Suzuki built himself,
    echoes like Watazumido Shuso's bamboo flute drawing its breath through Aphex Twin's ambient hull,
    an aural free fall that lets the body blow about, weightless.  As Jim O'Rourke nicely put it, Suzuki's
    music ""reminds us that we don't need to rush to feel alive, don't need to 'be somewhere' in the next
    15 minutes, because we're already 'there', all you have to do is listen.""</p><p>
    ""Drumming"" builds to incomprehension, as incessant waterfalls on a hand drum cascade beyond any
    rhythmic pattern. The birds and glass tubes of ""Ha Go Ro Mo"" float between a Pygmy lukembi,
    Tibetan prayer bowl, and Javanese gamelan, vibrations somehow disembodied from any obvious
    geography. Most peculiar on the double-disc set is ""Plate Juggling"", an archived performance
    from 1984. Set up for lock grooves on three record players, Suzuki's sounds at times approximate
    ducks on a pond, kazoos, and Tuvan throat singers. As these odd bursts of quacks and skronks
    build, the audience's unmitigated laughter becomes yet another source, finding its place among
    the inimitable noises. At turns minimal and maddening, this piece makes for a most singular listening
    experience, drastically altering concepts of what can be made from such grating sounds.</p><p>
    Suzuki's unadorned sense of play has been cause for admiration: O'Rourke, David Toop, and Eye
    from Boredoms all sound off in wonderment of what he's capable of creating from such nondescript
    items. To simply suggest that Suzuki makes incredible soundscapes out of sun-baked brick echo chambers,
    elongated springs, looping records, rocks, or empty beer bottles is to falsely convey that he's
    somehow distinct from these objects. As ancient scribe Tzu-ch'I put it: ""Blowing on the ten thousand
    things in a different way, so that each can be itself-- all take what they want for themselves, but
    who does the sounding?""</p></div>"|7639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7639-odds-and-ends/|8.5|Andy Beta

I would imagine that in electronic     music, the desire to carve a unique sonic identity into the endless wall of     digital possibilities is even stronger. Simply put, with the amount of music     being produced today, it's difficult to stand out, and the number of people     who have created a distinct musical fingerprint in the last few years is     relatively small. You can always tell Pole when you hear him (although,     judging by his new EP, that's about to change). Same goes for Boards of     Canada, Gas, Drexciya, and Aphex Twin. And way up on that list of laptoppers     with an immediately identifiable sound is Jan Jelinek.</p><p>Whether he's recording as Farben, Gramm, or under his own name, Jelinek     always jumps out of the speakers. I reckon the laptop set has roughly equal     access to all the sound design and processing software out there, but     Jelinek is doing things with his programs that other artists haven't     considered. He has an almost preternatural ability to burrow inside     glitches and surface noise and emerge with the emotional heart of the     sound.</p><p>His fondness for jazz, which becomes more apparent with each record,     is not a love of live improvisation, despite his recent Computer Soup     collaboration's indications to the contrary; it's a love for the stacks     of dusty, grimy, crackly vinyl artifacts of the post-bop era, a record     collector's view of jazz history. One imagines Jelinek getting chills from     a chewed-up copy of some late 60s combo featuring electric piano, that     something in the hisses, pops and wavering tone of an unsteady turntable     must have touched his soul.</p>
<p>Jelinek's record referencing continues with <em>La Nouvelle Pauvreté</em>,     his follow-up to 2001's <em>Loop-finding-jazz-records</em> after last year's     <em>Textstar</em>, a stunning collection of Farben EPs. (Jelinek's addition     of the fictional ""Exposures"" finds him indulging in the dry German humor     shared by Atom Heart and Burnt Friedman.) The record begins with the     two-minute ""Introducing"", a gradually swelling gurgle of dread that ends     abruptly with the sound of applause, and then ""Music to Interrogate By""     quickly drops into a groove.</p>
<p>It's a classic Jelinek track in a housey, Farben-esque vein, driven by an     acoustic bass riff, sampled ride cymbals, and a spacey electric piano     melody. On the one hand, it almost seems as though a band <em>could</em> be     playing, but Jelinek has a way of distorting the sonic signifiers in a way     that makes you unsure of exactly what you're hearing. The mix is weird-- odd     pops seem to bump the instruments aside, and the acoustic space just doesn't     seem of this earth. The applause that starts the track reappears twice, at     the end of what could be considered ""solos."" It's a brilliant and funny     device, suggesting with a wink that ""Music to Interrogate By"" is the work     of some band working a Village Vanguard in a parallel universe.</p>
<p>When I listened to <em>La Nouvelle Pauvreté</em> for the first time, halfway     through ""Music to Interrogate By"", I decided that this was my album of the     year.  This was premature, though, as the rest of the record, while still     very strong, doesn't make my jaw drop like that second track. What the album     <em>is</em>, though, is a surprisingly varied work, incorporating new sounds     and elements while remaining identifiably Jelinek. He's clearly experimenting,     trying to figure out how to build on his already considerable accomplishments,     and more often than not he succeeds.</p>
<p>The most noticeable addition here is Jelinek's voice, which appears in some     form on about half the tracks. ""Facelift"" features an oddly processed doubled     vocal, an octave apart, mumbling something I can't quite understand. Underneath     are a series of metallic taps, some clicks, and a deceptively funky acoustic     bass. ""There Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of)"" has Jelinek sculpting     feedback in a tuned, rhythmic drone as his dark vocals intone the title, singing     this time. It's actually quite effective and borders on great-- if Coil invented     gothic glitch, Jelinek brings it into the 21st Century. ""Trust the Words of Stevie""     is less successful, with Jelinek deadpanning, ""Do I love you/ I swear I do,"" in     a kind of pseudo-soul loverman voice that doesn't quite work as either parody or     the real thing, even if the backing music is typically fantastic.</p>
<p>Two more standout instrumentals ensure <em>La Nouvelle Pauvreté</em>'s greatness.     ""If's, And's and But's"" uses some primo 70s soul samples-- primarily some disco     strings, flute and an electric bass-- that Jelinek shapes into a nimble, bubbly     pattern. The sublime ""Davos S (Trio 'Round Midnight)"" employs guitar samples to     construct an homage to the gentle, reflective jazz of someone like Jim Hall. There     are more odd string samples, which, when combined with drum programming that sounds     like a digital ghost of a bongo, turns the piece into a Lynchian dream of the 50s     West Coast sound.</p>
<p><em>La Nouvelle Pauvreté</em> is not a perfect album and doesn't poke its head     out quite the way either <em>Loop-finding-jazz-records</em> or <em>Textstar</em> did,     but I'm glad to hear Jelinek shuffling the deck a bit. His conception of sound,     which is one of the most breathtakingly original and creative going, also proves     itself to be robust and adaptable to experiment.</p></div>"|4235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4235-la-nouvelle-pauvrete/|8.3|Mark Richardson

I'm not talking
    about theme songs, but the ""background"" music most people barely realize
    is there.  The composers of cop show chase tunes and ad jingles have to
    make everything come together in less time and with greater impact than
    even the most immediate pop. Furthermore, they have to make their presence
    known behind huge explosions and back alley shenanigans without jumping so
    far out front that their stuff detracts from the scene.  It's a catch 22,
    you see, and the best TV music often betrays its supporting role by being
    eminently listenable beyond the big black box-- not that most people are
    running out to buy the <i>Love Boat</i> soundtrack.  German rare grooves
    label Crippled Dick Hot Wax has made a point to dig up some of the finest
    in European media gloss from the 60s and 70s, making the case that maybe
    I've overlooked a musical goldmine on TV all these years.</p><p>
    
    Similar to other CDHW comps (<i>Popshopping</i>, <i>Beretta 70</i>, <i>Beat
    at Cinecitta</i>, etc.), <i>Give Peas a Chance</i>, which focuses on German
    crime dramas and action sequence blare, seems most obviously targeted to DJs
    always on the hunt for a new break-- not that putting them out on an
    internationally marketed CD is a good way to protect their obscurity.  The
    other part of the demographic would be a space-age pop crowd who isn't
    satisfied with only one Stereolab record every year, especially now that
    the whole campy lounge craze has died down.  However, most of this music is
    good for any slightly off-center chill, and at the very least is better than
    watching old <i>Columbo</i> episodes.</p><p>
    
    The bulk of the compilation features funky, jazz-informed jams from the 70s
    (though the music ranges for the 60s to the 90s).  British composer (and
    former Olivia Newton-John bandleader, major plus) Alan Hawkshaw contributes
    two of the best tunes with ""Troubleshoot Vol. 2"" and the slick, <i>Head
    Hunters</i>-style funk of ""Name of the Game"".  The latter track lays down
    a patented <i>Barney Miller</i> drum/bass groove over which the Fender Rhodes
    (greatest instrument of the 70s) drops solo breaks the likes of which should
    not have been possible outside of Harlem.  And, oh yes, there are slinky
    porno strings.  Lots of them.  It's an old-school slice of fuzz-funk that
    trumps Guy Ritchie's entire career.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere is George Fenton and Ken Freeman's synth-heavy 80s track ""Mobil
    Unit"", which makes me nostalgic for <i>Miami Vice</i> even though I never
    watched it.  Fred Berlipp's ""Crime in Beat"" is classic <i>Dragnet</i>-style
    shimmy-groove-- the kind that makes modern interpreters of this genre like
    John Zorn's Naked City seem all too mechanical in comparison.  The overdriven
    ""Good Company"", with big band horns, strings, clavinet, tympanis and a solo
    12-string guitar turns what was probably a run-of-the-mill chase scene into
    symphonic grandeur with a beat.</p><p>
    
    It goes without saying that not every track is essential, and I'm a little
    confused as to why two new Freddy Gigele (one of the most active soundtrack
    composers in Germany today) pieces were included: They're good throwbacks to
    the era in which most of the other tunes were made, but stand out like digital
    sore thumbs.  Also, some of the tunes tend to lapse into novelty, like the campy
    take on Middle Eastern music of Dieter Reith's ""Arabia"".  But as a whole, it's
    not a bad way to get a party started.  Book it, Dan-O.</p></div>"|1866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1866-give-peas-a-chance/|7.7|Dominique Leone

    Life's a gas<br/>
    I hope it's gonna last""<br/>
    --Marc Bolan, ""Life's a Gas""</i></p><p>
    
    Just before Marc Bolan was killed in a car crash in 1977, he seemed on the cusp of an artistic
    and commercial resurgence.  His death marked one more lost opportunity in a career studded
    with them.  He was the decade's first superstar in Britain, but he never hit it off with America,
    due in part to a stateside inability to comprehend camp, and in part to Bolan's own carelessness.
    Just as the support of his native audience was wavering, his ego burst from the pressures of
    fame and increasing drug abuse. He had missed his chance, and never got another.  His few Yankee
    fans worried that the man unfairly derided as bubblegum by prog-leaning audiences and DJs would
    have his vital contributions reduced to his lone U.S. hit, filed next to Wild Cherry in the stacks.
    And with the exception of a devoted cult, that's exactly how the States still see him.</p><p>
    
    Leave it to the saints at Rhino Records to preserve yet another precious slice of our musical
    heritage. They've now reissued T.Rex's <i>Electric Warrior</i>, the first and best of a trio
    of brilliant albums.  Its two successors-- <i>The Slider</i> (1972) and <i>Tanx</i> (1973)--
    have nearly vanished from music shops, and with a comprehensive best-of collection now available,
    <i>Electric Warrior</i> seemed destined to follow them into the void.  Thankfully, this catastrophe
    has been averted: Bolan may have been known for his singles, but his albums-- and this one in
    particular-- deserve to be heard in their entirety.</p><p>
    
    For those hunting down the singles, <i>Electric Warrior</i> does contain the immortal ""Bang a
    Gong (Get it On)"", but that's neither the only nor the best reason to pick it up.  What makes
    this record so enduring is its almost accidental emotional depth: When T.Rex is kicking out the
    jams, they sound like they're having the most gleeful, absurd good time ever committed to wax.
    There's nothing so glorious in rock and roll as hearing Bolan croon, ""Just like a car, you're
    pleasing to behold/ I'll call you Jaguar if I may be so bold,"" over his namesake boogie.</p><p>
    
    The most significant aspect of <i>Electric Warrior</i> isn't its arena rock confidence; it's
    that Bolan allows his grinning mask to slip.  With the incomparable aid of producer Tony
    Visconti, Bolan sketches a vast, empty room, where, after the party's over, he resides alone,
    wide-eyed and desperate.  On ballads like ""Cosmic Dancer"", ""Monolith"" and ""Girl"", he speaks
    in the same gibberish as elsewhere, but he's clearly haunted-- by what we can't say.  But the
    gaping, searing question mark that comes at the conclusion of the album-- guitar feedback
    paired with a string section, holding a shivering and very ambivalent cluster of notes--
    is just one of many clues that there's more to <i>Electric Warrior</i> than its surface lets
    on.  This is not simply a man who plays party songs because he wants to: This is a man who
    plays party songs to fend off darkness.</p><p>
    
    For this reissue, Rhino remastered the original tapes and added seven bonus tracks (six songs
    and an interview). The updated sound is a modest improvement over the first-generation CD, but
    no news is good news, recalling those hotly contested Iggy Pop and Velvet Underground remasters.
    Though the sound could've been polished more, it's most important that the production hasn't
    been inflated. <i>Electric Warrior</i> wouldn't be the same album with the meaty tone of
    <i>The Slider</i>, with all its shadows and doubt chased away or ignored.</p><p>
    
    The bonus tracks range from decent to very good: ""Raw Ramp"" stands out for the lurid line, ""Woman,
    I love your chests/ Baby, I'm crazy 'bout your breasts,"" but none of them are as revealing as the
    interview, during which a thoughtful Bolan reveals that the album was a self-conscious attempt to
    win the attention of America.  And because he had precious little time to accomplish everything
    he wanted to, there was a sense of urgency, that if he was ever going to take over the States, he
    had to do it immediately.</p><p>
    
    It's a devastating interview, considering how his ambitions deteriorated into addiction soon after,
    but it offers keen insight into Bolan's mindset at that moment when he seemed poised to finally
    conquer the entire world.  In fact, what makes Rhino's reissue wonderful is that it reminds us
    of that excitement with its every detail, presenting <i>Electric Warrior</i> to U.S. shores with
    the love and fanfare it always deserved but never received.  It's bittersweet adulation for a

Well, for the past two or three years, that seems
    to have been the modus operandi of much underground hip-hop.  While the beats of the mainstream have become
    progressively more dance-oriented (and have, in many cases, even incorporated some refreshing experimentalism),
    the beats of the underground have grown more defiantly straightforward and dance-hostile.  Those of us who
    love a snappy club burner but despise the insipidness of gangsta-bling lyrics have been forced to suck it
    up and just pray the DJ mixes some Aesop Rock vocals with a little Miami booty crunk.</p><p>
    But along comes NYC concept junkie Mike Ladd, the sole perpetrator behind The Majesticons and The Infesticons,
    two fictitious, rival hip-hop groups whose records have included guest spots from EL-P, Saul Williams, and
    Priest and Beans of Antipop Consortium.  The short story: The Infesticons represent for the underground;
    The Majesticons rep the mainstream; both are entangled in a perpetual, futuristic battle of wits for the
    ultimate prize: TOTAL CONTROL OF HIP-HOP'S FUTURE.  <i>Beauty Party</i>, the latest chapter in this ongoing
    saga, sees The Majesticons at the height of commercial dominance, having gained notoriety and risen to
    prominence in previous installments.  With so much ""access to excess"", they go mad with their wealth, buying
    up every material possession imaginable.  The joke is that they've transformed from hard street thugs rocking
    diamond-encrusted caps into full-blown yuppies.</p><p>
    It's a great parody, but what's greater is that it's not just satire for its own sake; it's an excuse for
    Ladd to pile on platinum-shiny beats, scorching robotic tweak, and aggro-maniacal bling.  ""Brains Party""
    sees Ladd appropriating the chorus to a Pet Shop Boys song, Puffy-style: ""I got the brains/ You got the
    looks/ Let's make lots of money/ We are the game/ We are the crooks/ Let's take all their money.""  ""Platinum
    BlaQue Party"" is a breezed-up, cocoa-buttered R&amp;B; humper: ""Spellman lady friend and lesbian ménage a trois/
    With a Wellesley friend, carafes of wine, la-day-da!""  And as usual, an all-star ensemble of guests fills
    out the record.  When El-P, with Can Ox's Vast Aire in tow, rhymes, ""All y'all dealing with virtual money/
    Shit, I wipe my ass with a twenty"" on ""Suburb Party"", the hilarity is pretty much beyond description.</p><p>
<i>Beauty Party</i>'s got more one-liners than a night at the Apollo, but beyond the overlying humor, the
    record drives home a point by making a compelling argument against dogmatism and materialism, and addressing
    issues of class and value systems, and their impact on hip-hop culture. ""Pirahna Party"" illustrates the
    devouring conundrum of gentrification: ""We got the stocks/ We got the banks/ You keep the glocks/ We want
    the docks/ You keep the shanks/ We got the tanks/ We keep the goods/ We subvert the hood/ We buy you out/
    Or kick you out/ Tear down your house/ Tear down the blocks/ Those mom and pops.""</p><p>
    Through satire, Ladd has created a perfect amalgamation of underground and mainstream hip-hop.  <i>Beauty
    Party</i> possesses an intelligent, cutting consciousness, and its club-consumability will allow that to
    reach far more people than if he'd just rapped some ""fuck the machine"" rhyme over a dragging, think-rap
    tempo.  That these two seemingly disparate styles work so well together might strike some as a bit ironic,
    but it proves that if these warring factions can balance their diametrical opposition, they might discover
    a medium not just happy but straight-up blissful.</p></div>"|5050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5050-beauty-party/|8.7|Julianne Shepherd

    Fontanelle's really got a contender: ""Just, Go, Crazy"".  Holy Shit.  I just can't avoid imagining the smug
    looks of self-satisfaction on the face of whoever okayed this.  How droll!  Nothing says ""cut loose"" like a
    faint attempt at wordplay, after all.  Presumably, the intent here is to be clever through a contradiction
    produced through the combination of a mandate to have fun and punctuated restraint.  The problem is, it's
    neither clever nor amusing.  Instead, this cunningly summarizes everything that's wrong with Fontanelle,
    <i>Style Drift</i>, and the rapidly decaying post-rock genre itself; the music purports to entertain, but
    when it truly comes time to pony up the ""fun"", it generally fails to produce anything beyond cerebral
    bemusement.  To all you turtlenecked purveyors of aural brainteasers: Music needs not only a mind, but a
    heart.</p><p>
    
    Fontanelle have clearly not thought this through.  They've given us three releases (two full-length) in as
    many years, and the only thing that's really changed is that each one has become progressively colder than
    the last.  For <i>Style Drift</i>, they play up the electrofunk angle a little more than on 2001's <i>F.</i>,
    but ultimately this is nothing more than yet another excursion into frigid, uncomfortably sparse arrangements
    of synth-driven jazz.  Teflon-coated keyboard improvs and anemic percussion are the emotionally vacant core
    of Fontanelle's work; too fragile to embrace, too slippery to hold, and forever out of reach.  Every snare
    hit, every note of this album is calculated, precise, and entirely soulless, like some terrifying, fusion
    jazz Terminator.</p><p>
    
    I'm tempted to cite ""Red Light, Green Light"" as a sole exception, but it's not an easy call.  On one hand,
    the delicate keys and wobbly, wah-wah guitarwork show signs of a pulse early on; for a moment, if you close
    your eyes, you can almost imagine flesh-and-blood people operating the instruments.  But on the other hand,
    it's difficult to shake the impression that it's only an illusion created through comparison with the other
    tracks, just as if a coma patient were compared to a corpse.  In the end, not even that flattering contrast
    will result in anything worth recommending here.</p><p>
    
    Once again, Fontanelle prove to be long on technique and short on the emotion necessary to move their
    audience, and that's the real tragedy.  When it comes to ability, these guys clearly have detailed files,
    but it's a shame to see it wasted on little more than technical exercises.  Every time a new Fontanelle
    record comes out, I keep wondering if it'll finally be the album where they actually sound like they care
    about <i>what</i> they're playing more than <i>how</i> they're playing.  Nope, this one, either.</p></div>"|3144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3144-style-drift/|3.3|Eric Carr

    melodies, sly humor, caricatured self-confidence), from their early days as three-chord ruffians, to their
    brilliant sophomore effort <i>In It for the Money</i>, to the Stonesy swagger of their self-titled third
    album.  Their fourth, <i>Life on Other Planets</i>, is a 40-minute tour of 70s British rock, but more to
    the point, it's a summary of Supergrass' own career, merging all of the band's many mutations into one
    decisive sound, for better or worse.  On the one hand, there's an abundance of energy and some great
    songwriting; on the other, there's less focus here than on either of their previous two releases.</p><p>
    
    This is clear from the outset, when the disc opens with a brief BBC-ish synth intro (could have fallen out
    of the back pocket of Rick Wakeman's flared, embroidered hip huggers, for all I know), before launching into
    the flashy, piano-pinned strut of ""Za"", a traditional Supergrass rocker stuffed with big, crashing Mick
    Ronson riffage, but backed by strange, wordless vocals.  From there, we smash headfirst into ""Rush Hour
    Soul"", an unpredicted blast of musclebound guitar and thunderfingered bass with heavy eyeliner and a
    sequined jean jacket, before being faced with ""Seen the Light"", which features a questionable Elvis
    impression on the hapless line, ""I'm a rock 'n' roll singer in a rock 'n' roll band,"" compensated for
    with a great melody.</p><p>
    
    So far, we've got a handful of strong showings from the shag-headed Londoners, and no actual cohesion.  Then
    again, stability can only count for so much when tracks like the full-throttle murder melodrama of ""Brecon
    Beacons"" and the Moog-slathered ""Grace"", with a melody sticker than a sun-melted Baby Ruth, come bursting
    from the fray.  Ahh, if only the whole album were that consistent.  The thing is, their 100%-of-everything
    approach has its drawbacks, and nowhere is this more clearly evident than on ""Evening of the Day"", which--
    though it nails a perfect balance between Small Faces-style Brit-rock and straight-up B.B. King blues--
    isn't all that engaging, content to devolve into a kind of aimless music hall thing that sounds like it
    was recorded several beers after tipsy.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Never Done Nothing Like That Before"" marinates the Swell Maps in ""Strawberry Fields"" Mellotron,
    but what <i>could</i> be sonically interesting instead annoys in the context of a song whose vocals are
    contemptibly forgettable and whose lyrics regard ""blowing chunks.""  ""The Funniest Thing"" has some subversively
    catchy, dark grooves in its verses, but the song's form is all over the place, and never gels into anything
    remotely memorable.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Life on Other Planets</i> brings it back together at the end for the closer, ""Run"", whose glossy
    harmonies and squiggly effects pick up on the spacier bits of the 1970s and squash them into a glowing,
    noise-addled coda fitting for an album that spends most of its time burning energy with reckless abandon.
    And all told, the record's a fine supplement to the 70s, for those times when you just want it all in one
    place.  Once the mild frustration with certain tracks subsides and you're strapped in, Supergrass deliver
    far better than expected eight years into their career.  Which all goes to show that just because you've
    got nearly a decade into the Britpop game doesn't mean you have to go stale.  Right, Suede?</p></div>"|7624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7624-life-on-other-planets/|7.6|Joe Tangari

    The Orb, Orbital, and the decidedly non-circular Future Sound of London. Gobbling up ethnicities and new
    technologies like handfuls of x-tabs, FSOL even hyped the ISDN by releasing an album created completely by
    way of the burgeoning young network, amalgamating odd strains of organic matter with digital detritus.
    But after <i>Dead Cities</i>, the techno game morphed out from under them, and the duo disappeared until
    their slight re-emergence with last year's Floyd-nostalgic <i>The Isness</i>.</p><p>
    
    Taking the ancient paradox of ""child is the father to the man"" to the Braindance man-child scene, this EP
    is future-FSOLer Brian Dougans' earliest work from the incipient, hedonistically heady times in the early
    days of Madchester. Lost in the acidic mix of time, it's now come back around, on a label inspired by this
    self-same piece of music, Richard James' own Rephlex label. Created entirely on the Roland TB 303 (the
    bedrock for acid house noise squiggle and bump) way back in 1989, Dougans synched up with video artist Mark
    McLean for the influential Stakker video, one of the first visual projects to come out of the British
    electronic scene. An eye-candy standard for early raves and acid culture happenings (until co-opted into an
    epileptic-inducing advert), it was a massive statement as to the audio-visual possibilities of the new music,
    cutting and pasting at a pace that would drive even Brion Gysin dizzy.</p><p>
    
    This isn't the first time Rephlex has reached into its head of halcyon flashbacks to pull forth a primordial,
    pre-computerized gem of pure acid ferociousness-- remember, they also reissued 808 State's <i>Newbuild</i>
    a couple years back.  But even that resurrection couldn't match the speed of ideas at work here.  The
    emergency-level frequencies quickly distort into a driving four-on-the-floor stomp, undergoing permutations
    with a particularly harsh powertools buzz cutting all around it, even as the beat cools into something a bit
    more classic after a minute's length. The frenzy of clashing sounds recalls Carl Stalling cartoons, going for
    the most absurd squiggles, rubbery yanks, and rhythmic juxtapositions possible within the different patches
    of synth sound and editing capabilities.</p><p>
    
    The core of the soundtrack lies between tracks 7-10, which are the longest by far at roughly two minutes
    apiece. The droning of the keyboards is metallic, as if sparks are spraying off the grooves, while the
    machine beats chug on unabated.  Track 9 has a very sharp twinkling of panned crystals while the 303 squirts
    basso profundo underneath, creating a curious ambiance that would become the M.O. of Aphex Twin's <i>Selected
    Ambient Works Vol. II</i>. Track 10 has the jet stream bubbles and processed voices that were crucial to the
    early 808 State sound, too.</p><p>
    
    Twenty-one tracks go supersonic in just under twenty-five minutes, eradicating any recognizable patterns or
    large cogs of beat after more than a brief appearance. This attention span deficiency is the most telling
    influence on present-day activities by folks like Aphex Twin, Bogdan Raczynski, or Squarepusher, who can't
    keep still on a beat for more than a few seconds. Either as a history lesson through the classic Acid noises
    of a decade back, or as just a good ol' mix, <i>Eurotechno</i> is still quite quick and efficient work,
    even for a time machine.</p></div>"|7457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7457-eurotechno/|7.6|Andy Beta

    kitsch, or eccentric or garble-throated singers.  For some of us, just getting into country music
    was a struggle.  But Pluxus is hard to take in a different way: Most of <i>European Onion</i> sounds
    just like an old video game (say, Super Mario Brothers for the 8-bit NES.  The bleeps and
    bips can make this grating, the same way you wouldn't run out to buy a record of
    traffic noise or alarm clock sounds.  If it doesn't bother you, the results can be charming, but
    don't say you weren't warned.</p><p>
    This Swedish four-piece employs only synths and tinny drum machines, with a couple of vocal snippets
    thrown in for accent. The beeping, bloop-heavy music has a robotic beat and a disturbingly repetitive
    cheerfulness, as it chirps the same tune over and over.  None of the tracks last very long, but
    just like a video game soundtrack they seem to go on forever, with insistent rhythms and
    bitmapped, digital rainbow flourishes.</p><p>
    Let's say you don't mind that sound.  Pluxus are often lumped in with electronica and IDM mainstays,
    but they call their music ""electronic pop,"" which is a less pretentious and more accurate description.
    Generally more ornate and less eclectic than their earlier work, <i>European Onion</i> is concise and
    melodic, with multiple sections weaving together into a marvel of twee songform.  ""Rödval, Blåval""
    (the opener) and the hyper-ecstatic ""Agent Tangent""-- which toots along like the theme for
    a marathon run by six-inch-tall people-- are the strongest examples, with infectiously bright,
    multilayered keyboards far more colorful than you'd expect from such a limited palette.  The
    less piercing tracks-- ""Dagsmeja"" and ""Moni""-- are nice breaks into gentler, more standard IDM modes,
    switching to softer tones and background synth washes.</p><p>
    For all the punchy melodies, Pluxus also try to take a plaintive tone on the somewhat nostalgic
    ""Igår"" and the truly melancholy ""Molltolerans"".  Still, it's about as suspenseful
    as watching someone else play your favorite game: ""Get the power-up!  Jump over those mushrooms--
    save the princess!"" Pluxus are more convincing when upbeat, when you can picture the bunch of them '
    huddled around, drunk on technology, hammering out the most nauseatingly chipper music imaginable.
    They've earned a few extra lives with <i>European Onion</i>, and should advance to more challening
    boards in the near future.</p></div>"|6359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6359-european-onion/|6.3|Chris Dahlen

    sunglasses against a hot pink background, a sharp fear plagued me, and some tough questions burned in my
    mind.  Had the former Antipop Consortium rapper/genius gone... electroclash?!  And, like, what's going on
    with the fauxhawk?  I refused to believe the future poet had fallen prey to the inflated ego that often
    comes prepackaged with a solo career-- especially since this guy's former group, Antipop Consortium, helped
    pull a mostly unwilling leg of hip-hop kicking and screaming into the future by shouting peripheral rhymes
    through a whooshing holodeck of a recording and strapping it with clicky avant-garde beats.  Would Beans
    really betray us by releasing something... banal?</p><p>
    
    Well, it's not quite that easy.  The beats on Beans' first solo record, <i>Tomorrow Right Now</i>, have
    wrapped themselves in a bare, futura-glitch of machine hi-hat claps, scratched-out bass, and blurred, trebly
    kickdrum, with the assistance of Antipop producer E. Blaize.  The record is also deeply rooted in electro,
    but even with that said, it's not nearly what you'd expect.  <i>Tomorrow</i> pays homage to the gods of
    early 80s drum machines in a method consistent with Antipop Consortium: It melds the elements of current
    hip-hop with the Warp label's signature Powerbook programming.  The lyrics belie a certain nostalgia, as
    with ""Mutescreamer""'s lyrical mix of tight, beat-hopping styles, set against a chorus whose cadence sounds
    straight from a rare Enjoy Records cut, circa 1980.  On ""Hot Venom"", Beans spits, ""King Daddy, disco rad/
    Totally tubular.../  Y'all need to quit like Nicorette.""  And with America fully thrust into popular
    aesthetics of the 1980s, it's debatable whether dropping the words ""totally tubular"" and showing an affinity
    for neon is nostalgic or terribly cutting edge.</p><p>
    
    The single-- and the track in which Beans states his mission of intent-- is the incredibly def ""Phreek the
    Beat"", a pared-down mash of island flavor with a true-school-styled lady singing the staccato pre-chorus.
    Beans sings an easy, dubby boast, declaring himself ""the new wave vandal"": ""So unbelievable/ As a human
    being nothing holds a candle.""  It sounds like Roxanne Shante cheerleading Beans into space-- like it was
    recorded in a vacuum, all clipped and dry and closed-in, a paradox of time where the cadence of Bronx '79
    meets the vision of Brooklyn '03.  It is Beans' manifesto of ensuring the past's concrete place in his
    funkyass future.</p><p>
    
    This is where Beans excels, when the beats are bent and everything sounds like a fresh voice-over on an old
    episode of <i>Star Trek</i>-- the drifting deep tempo of ""Toast"", the spiraling, oscillating keyboards of
    ""Hot Venom"", the plastic-y, cheese-grater whirls of ""Mutescreamer"".   ""Booga Sugar"", meanwhile, is a
    silky-flowed poem in first person about a blunt-addicted rapper who eventually dumps rhymes for a life
    suckling the crack pipe (Nancy Reagan and her gateway drug pamphlets would have shit her pants for this one),
    and ""Crave"" forgoes the future for a jazz-style scat featuring a capella vocals, finger snaps, and simple
    beatboxing.</p><p>
    
    On his solo debut, Beans twirls and stretches his language, depicting the life of a poet-rapper, heavy on
    non-traditional boasts and battle rhymes.  But he lacks the gulping, deep tone of former APC cohorts Priest
    and Sayyid, which means the beats usually usurp his rhymes-- especially on the only halfway-there track
    ""Mearle"", where he employs an atonal style of yelling that seems almost disdainful of the listener. He did
    an excellent job of programming percussion and synth, and throwing unexpected loops everywhere like secret
    codes.  And there's no electroclashing on this record, so that counts for something.  Yet, while it sounds
    extremely fresh right now, I can't help but wonder if, ten years down the road, <i>Tomorrow Right Here</i>
    will feel as dated as the cardboard backdrops of <i>Lost in Space</i>.</p></div>"|603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/603-tomorrow-right-now/|7.1|Julianne Shepherd

They run up the walls and crawl into
    my bird's cage to eat seeds, nibble through unopened loaves of Orowheat, and most heinous of all, they ate
    out the crotch of my roommate's old panties.  Forgoing all the glue traps and classic spring-loaded devices,
    we opted instead for ultrasonic devices to drive out the rodents, and as you shuffle into the kitchen now
    for that late-night nibbling, you can hear its subsonic pulsing through your head: deet-deet-deet-deet.</p><p>
    
    So when the newest Ryoji Ikeda CD came in the mail, I figured it'd free one more room of the house from these
    pests, as his past oeuvre laid similar sonic matrices throughout the acoustic spaces of the room, sometimes
    clearing it, other times hypnotizing it.  <i>+/-</i> was an instant classic of edge-of-perception phenomena,
    frequencies being felt more than heard as their components vacillated in and out of the range of the human
    ear, destabilizing the crystals within and altering their audible nature as the listener's position changed
    in relation to the stereo.  <i>Matrix</i> was scalpel-sharp sine waves and similarly minded clinical clicks
    on two separate CDs. But hopes for hole-free laundry sunk considerably when I read the fine print of this
    release, which states: ""No electronic sounds used."" I could imagine the mizzle of little teeth through the
    walls as the CD started to spin, and although the opening seconds could fool you, this is not only a
    completely live instrumental affair, but it's all composed for strings, executed by the Musiques Nouvelles Ensemble,
    as well as a Japanese string quartet at the New National Theatre in Tokyo.</p><p>
    
    ""Op.1"", segmented into four movements, is scored for nonet, although its austerity would never reveal so
    many players without the acknowledgements. Strings resound in single file, before being bowed into different
    laminal contexts with a sympathetic relation to the other entities. Ikeda's compositional attention is as an
    alembic, distilling all players into the true physical sound of their rosined bows on the strings, and the
    auras emitted from each string-- the attack, sustain, and decay works individually and then in combination.
    The first two movements are stunning, as the violins, violas, and cellos swell with a deliberate asceticism,
    making achingly slow passes over their strings, as disembodied as headlights in the absolute darkness of
    highway night driving, glowing singularly yet creating a chain of luminous entities in ensemble. This is
    not unlike the Doppler effect of <i>+/-</i>, whose observed nature was dependent on subjective factors such
    as speaker setup or whether the disc was heard on headphones and at what volume. That phenomenon is relegated
    to the music itself now, not in how it transmits to the listener's ear.</p><p>
    
    By the third movement, the violins and violas are passing like ships in the night, the double bass thudding
    against their hulls as if to mark their dimensional presence.  The spatial destabilization is similar to the
    late works of Morton Feldman, not in terms of scale or chromatic problem solving, but in its subtle outlining
    of the void in which it all hovers, like Sonar describing that which encases it. Isolated, each instrument is
    made to resonate or fluctuate much like an electronic tone in the studio, and it's in merger that the actual
    physical nature of the sound becomes more readily apparent.</p><p>
    
    What serves as the greatest hurdle of <i>Op.</i> is a problem many contemporary composers (especially those
    using technology) face when working with more classical instruments that carry hundreds of years worth of
    historical weight within their sounds: How do you recontextualize these instruments to where they express
    something in a new manner? Or in Ikeda's case, where his previous electronic compositions drew so much
    attention to sound's physical occupation of the air and how it reacts to the placement of the ear, what
    is he going to express, emotionally, melodically, or structurally, with these scored string ensembles, be
    they quartets or trios? With the arrival and passing of two versions of ""Op.2"", apparently not too much,
    I'm afraid, aside from how interesting these instruments sound as they slide past each other over time.</p><p>
    
    Sections of <i>Op.</i> remain fascinating, distilled into a new acoustic context that still reveals the
    audio essence Ikeda has made his own over ten years, but it remains on the surface of the sounds only, not
    to what resonates and connects it all underneath. One could also marvel just at how the bow moves on, say,
    Bach's Unaccompanied Cello Suites or even Xenakis' scores for the Arditti Quartet, but there's also an
    essence beyond mere physicality. As I begin to discern the high squeal of bus brakes outside or the
    incessant pulsations of the electric pest repellent already plugged in as they fuse with and then secede
    from Ikeda's latest compositions, I keep thinking that by refusing his electronic past for this compositional
    project, he might have missed the pointillism.</p></div>"|4070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4070-op/|7.4|Andy Beta

    radio show and, halfway through his quite ordinary comment, yelled ""SCUM!"" The host, perplexed, hung up.
    Moments later, a young man in cahoots called and, halfway through his equally ordinary comment, also yelled
    ""SCUM!"" Thus was the career of The Screamer born. Over the next fourteen years, he continued to refine his
    practice, quickly abandoning the Dadaist approach of his early days and moving on to a more evolved style,
    at one point calling in to a Pro-Life program to testify to the pain of abortion with his tale of being an
    aborted child. Now, his greatest hits have been collected and released by TeenBeat so that anyone who didn't
    sift through hours of routine talk radio in the Washington D.C. area during the golden years leading up to
    1993 can hear what was going on in condensed form.</p><p>
    
    The Screamer's body of work stands today as a sometimes boring, sometimes hilarious, always compulsive piece
    of folk art. In repressive suburbia, there always appear signs that the teenaged members of the clan are not
    as enchanted with the idea of settling down into an utterly normal, regulated existence, but usually, the
    results are a few smashed mailboxes and a lot more smashed high schoolers. Perhaps different strains of
    destructive urges might converge, causing local teens to take their empty liquor bottles and throw them at
    cars as they pass by. But there is no art, no imagination, no bracing adolescent poetry to any of this. Not
    so with The Screamer. <i>Greatest Hits</i> shows him dipping fingers, toes, and even naughtier appendages
    into the stream of bland regularity so as to divert it just a little bit and test out his power to oppose
    the monolith that drives so many other youngsters to illicit sex and drugs. Perhaps The Screamer couldn't
    get his sweaty hands on either of those, but if this was ever cause for complaint with him, it's certainly
    not for those able to hear his calls today.</p><p>
    
    While guardians of the old artistic order constantly complain about the stultifying effect of our whirring
    electronic media, The Screamer proved (as did many of his fresh-faced cohorts, liberated from the shackles
    of tradition) that you can take any medium, no matter how apparently vapid, and turn it into something great
    with only creativity and a will to subvert.  Which is what makes <i>Greatest Hits</i> an enjoyable listen
    even when the jokes fall flat, which they occasionally do. To hear the hosts sputter as The Screamer trips
    them up, or to listen as they rant with excessive hyperbole about the immaturity, stupidity, even insanity
    of their assailant is to be informed of the fact that this little brat had done some real damage, that
    beyond just entertaining his small cabal of admirers, he was also reaching beyond the station appointed to
    him by society. While picking up a phone may not have been as glamorous as picking up a guitar in the late
    70s, it was just as punk, and if the humor on <i>Greatest Hits</i> sometimes grows monotonous, well, so did
    the music of The Damned, and you forgave them, didn't you?</p></div>"|7036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7036-greatest-hits/|7.6|Brian James

    bluesy Mariachi, desert-rock and jazz, and injecting healthy doses of experimentation into the otherwise
    straightforward records on which they've made guest appearances.  Yet, for their innovation and distinctive
    sound, their albums have always had their weak spots-- moments in which their ideas seemed to be running
    away with the band's ability to execute them.  That time has passed.  All of Calexico's previous strengths
    come home to roost on <i>Feast of Wire</i>, the band pushing their experiments further than ever before and
    pulling each of them off unfalteringly.  In short, Calexico have created their first genuinely masterful
    full-length, crammed with immediate songcraft, shifting moods and open-ended exploration.</p><p>
    A brief acoustic guitar figure and pounding waltz beat open things at a crisp gait.  Joey Burns quickly
    intones with the lines, ""Washed my face in the rivers of empire/ Made my bed with a cardboard crate,""
    immediately establishing the tension of the borderline that pulls Calexico's music in its many directions.
    Burns is suddenly a singer-- he's always made do with what he had, but the limitations that were once so
    apparent have developed into a strong and confident tenor, assertive and emotive.  The music behind him
    feels bolder and more courageous, too, as the veil of obscurity that guarded so much of their previous
    releases has vanished.  The detail of this album is utterly stunning, as melodies rise against countermelodies,
    subtle electronic processing seals guitars in amber, and instruments blend in fascinating and unpredictable
    ways.</p><p>
    The band keeps things tight and concise across sixteen tracks, and John Convertino's drums corral the rush
    of sound into all the right spaces, pushing the steel guitar motifs that color the background of ""Quattro
    (World Drifts In)"" up to meet Burns' vocals and beating back the bombastic strings that cascade over ""Black
    Heart"" like a desert thunderstorm.  ""Not Even Stevie Nicks"" is pristine pop that makes me wish Burns would
    find more occasions to use his falsetto.  It also makes me wish he'd print his lyrics, even if lines like,
    ""With a head like a vulture and a heart full of hornets/ He drives off the cliff into the blue,"" convey such
    a rush of emotions that they virtually fill in the blanks by themselves.</p><p>
    He's still full of border stories, too, with narratives like ""Across the Wire"" packing up tales of dodging
    the border patrol and leaving everything you know for the abstraction of hope.  ""Woven Birds"" is a hushed
    reverie for an abandoned mission that even the swallows have left to the ghosts, building to spine-tingling
    moments where the vocals, Melodica and vibes all meet on the same note and coalesce into a single sound.
    The piano and strings of ""The Book and the Canal"" serve as a moody pivot into the album's mostly instrumental
    second half, though the darkness of that piece is largely swept aside by ""Attack El Robot! Attack!"", which
    mashes Pharaoh Sanders, Portuguese guitar and German IDM into a beautiful stew of sci-fi strangeness.</p><p>
    ""Dub Latina"" and ""Crumble"" show Calexico burrowing deeper into jazz than ever before, with the latter
    featuring fluid guitar, trombone and trumpet solos squaring off against each other over a white-hot groove.
    ""Güero Canelo"" is a curious flamenco strut built around what sounds like a distorted Speak-n-Spell sample
    and sliding sound effects, while ""Whipping the Horse's Eyes"" and the closer, ""No Doze"", each examine big
    skies and desert stillness-- one with steel guitar and bowed bass, the other with bowed vibes, nylon strings,
    static, percussion and steel.  Burns is back to a whisper on the closer, but here it strikes as though he's
    trying not to wake someone sleeping in the room rather than shielding the listener from his limitations.</p><p>
    Calexico have always threatened to make a spectacular record, and even came close on 1998's <i>The Black
    Light</i>, but having spent the last three years honing their skills has paid off for them in ways no one
    could have predicted.  <i>Feast of Wire</i> calls on a stunning, finely kept arsenal of genres, textures and
    images to transport you to the Southwest's forgotten places and put you in the shoes of the people who stare
    across the border in both directions.  It is the album we always knew they had in them but feared they would
    never make.</p></div>"|1230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1230-feast-of-wire/|8.9|Joe Tangari

    Snake Mountain playset and that plastic guitar by Tiger and shipped them off to the Goodwill in cardboard
    boxes; and the kind that took all those little plastic chunks of your childhood and entombed them in the
    attic, where they sit waiting for a boring snow day or a summer of unemployment to be rediscovered and put
    back into use. With all of the plastic Casio beats, Master System interludes and chirping electric
    knick-knacks floating in the nostalgic soup that is <i>ABC DEF</i>, it seems pretty obvious that Nathan
    Michel's mom falls into the latter category. You can almost see her hanging his spelling tests on the fridge.</p><p>
    
    There's not a slide whistle or battery-powered keyboard or Rock'em Sock'em robot that hasn't been brought
    along for Michel's long imaginary drive through the broken-glass crystal city of pre-pubescence: Plastic
    recorders whimper, lonely video games repeat their Boss Level tunes in a desperate bid for attention, and
    tin toys of every stripe and temperament lose their shit, filling the play room with the rusty click-clack
    of brass keys slowly grinding down to a halt. This isn't group play-- make no mistake-- but rather an intense
    session of (presumably) dextromethorphan-fueled make-believe for Michel and the monsters in his closet. And
    just like any other intensely private childhood game, the rules of this one are almost incomprehensible to
    any of us other kids who wandered in late. It's trying to play Calvinball with an autistic chess prodigy.</p><p>
    
    The framework of <i>ABC DEF</i>, whose title suggests a much more robust and beat-conscious affair, is fairly
    simple and without much variation: an abyss of fragmented loops, sometimes as devolved as a dime store Indian
    drum, layered with various random patterns of everything from electric acoustic guitar and acid-soaked
    xylophone (""Pound Louder"") to the fluctuations of walkie-talkie frequencies backed by scrambled-egg organs
    (""Thirty Six to Forty Two""). The composition technique here is extremely randomized and discordant in some
    places, more consistent and even catchy in others; ""Untitled"" remains anonymous probably because it shares
    an ear with Team Doyobi and even Phoenecia for sublimely sick rhythms crafted from decimated analog clicks
    and burps, interrupted by a tense melody right out of <i>Kangaroo</i>.  And the sorrowful atmosphere
    generated by the faded Casio beat of ""Hello (Constant Sorrow)"" is as tender as it is cardboard-worthy. This
    is the senior year soundtrack for the love-struck kids at Nintendo High, but it starts the album off with a
    misleading message.</p><p>
    
    The majority of <i>ABC DEF</i> is not a big slumber party, but rather the story of one kid alone in his room,
    under the covers with a flashlight, plagued by a head cold and too much cough syrup. Some fascinating ideas
    spill out from Nathan Michel's fevered dreams, fully formed (the anthill micro-rave of ""Mufice"") and brief
    (the telephone coma that wraps itself around ""Hosey""), but introverted fantasies like this are going to take
    four years of art school and some heavy drinking to make sense of.</p><p>
    
    But then again, maybe some kids were just meant to play alone.</p></div>"|5262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5262-abc-def/|6.3|Mark Martelli

<p>""I'll show Grandma those pictures I took of you and the garden hose.</p>
<p>""Jesus Christ, kid, how long you gonna hold that over my head?  That's just how grown-ups water the lawn,     I'm telling you!  Augh, fine, one more.  But it's a scary one, so get ready.  It's a little story about how     Elevator's lead vocalist Rick White went crazy, and now is almost impossible to take seriously.  Ready?""</p>
<p><em>[Little Shaquille nods eagerly as his Grandpa slowly opens up the liner notes to Darkness -&gt; Light and     begins to reads aloud.]</em></p>
<p>""'Elevator is an exploratory [sic], a living documentary, subconscious analysis and premonition.  A taste of     perspective combing for clues in apocalyptic time.  Rolling fields of trees, at first one became these.  The     triangle, balance and the opposites.  We eerily roamed the red landscape with the curious door in the sky,     documenting with tape and paper.'  And it goes on like this!  You're a smart kid-- what's the moral of this     story?""</p>
<p>""Stay away from acid?""</p>
<p>""Quite right, my lad.  Now sleep well, if you can.""</p>
<p>""Wait, Grandpa.  Is LSD why <em>Darkness -&gt; Light</em> is so awful?""</p>
<p>""No, son; it's pronounced ""psychedelic.""  That what the hippies called it-- ""psych-rock,"" like the Floyd.     All of Elevator's stuff is like that.  Here, I'll play it.  Now, what you're hearing-- the synth washes,     the swirling tangles of guitar, the ridiculously 'freaky' vocals-- it might sound boring now, but Elevator's     awesome when you're whacked out of your mind on psychotropes.""</p>
<p>""What's 'psychotrope' mean?""</p>
<p>""It means stay the hell away from it if you ever want to see your trust fund, like we talked about.""</p>
<p>""This sounds bad.  The thundering percussion and pulsing bass send surges of vitality through the opener,     'You're a Deep Dark Hole', but then everything dissolves into sludge.  A few punk-charged riffs don't offer     enough structure or excitement to keep the album from plunging into a relentless mire of noise-filth.  I     was so pumped full of Ritalin that I couldn't even sit through the 16-minute masturbation marathon of     the title track-- it's so sloppy and limp, like they can't even play their instruments, and worse, can't     be bothered to even summon up some enthusiasm for the effort of trying.""</p>
<p>""How the hell does a six-year old learn to talk like that?""</p>
<p>""I've been reading Pitchfork.""</p>
<p>""Hmm... I'll need to send in some inane reader mail about this.  But that's not the point-- did you even     listen to the second half of the album?""</p>
<p>""How could I make it through the first?  Someone needs to clue Elevator in that the echo pedal is a     privilege, not a right.""</p>
<p>""Now, son, patience is a virtue.  It gets better!  If you don't grow old and die while waiting through the     rough patches of the early tracks, <em>Darkness -&gt; Light</em>, as the name implies, improves substantially.     Tara White's eerie coos drift in from somewhere just outside mortal realms of perception, breaking the vast     lull in the interior of the album.  'The Endless Winter' and 'Love' are really standard, jangly, acoustic     pieces, but they're very compelling.  Tara White's vocals are in a separate league from Rick's whispered     melodrama, mournful and haunting; the vocal duets between them have a fantastic air of mystery surrounding     them.  'Down Here' sports a sharp, evocative solo that hints at the psychic crush of the first tracks, but     couples it with actual musicianship for a slick closing piece.  It's too bad-- if you can just sit through     the first half, you'll enjoy the weird, secretive melodies of the later cuts.""</p>
<p>""But this first half is such a clusterfuck, Dad!  I won't believe the second part is that good, and you can't     make me.""</p>
<p>""'The Bloom' does kinda slide into formlessness for a while, and the sing-song-y speech gets old, but...     Never mind.  First part bad, second part good.  Get to sleep.  Oh, and son-- stay way from...""</p>
<p>""Acid.  I know, Dad.""</p>
<p>""No, from Pitchfork; they've got you swearing like a sailor.""</p>

DJ Spooky and Killah     Priest's latest collaboration couldn't compare compare to their previous collaboration on Spooky's     1998 album <em>Riddim Warfare</em>, but nevertheless, the single was laid out on many a     remixer's operating table, stripped, gassed, and primed for surgical exploration.</p><p>Featuring the competent if not spectacular skills of extended Wu-Family member Killah Priest, the     original mix is nothing special, a half-assed stab at urban grit that fails to generate synergy     between the academic street arrangements of Professor Spooky and Killah Priest's innocuous,     nondescript flow, a mix of Shaolin grandstanding and failed philosophy struggling to break out of     its tired, rehearsed rut. While <em>Riddim Warfare</em>'s ""Degree Zero"" held its own next to the     complex rhyme equations of Kool Keith and Sir Menelik, ""Catechism"" needs all the help it can get     to break free of a mediocre blueprint.</p><p>Yet the listener gets only a taste of the possibilities. The majority of the chosen remixers-- including     Big Dada representatives New Flesh and turntablist extraordinaire Deckwrecka-- walk down a less     inventive path, and turn in straightforward variations that target the track's obvious     hip-hop flavor, taking a cue from the dirty atmosphere in Killah Priest's delivery. New Flesh's     mix is predictably Ninja Tune: With big, acid jazz horns and a drum beat that gets lost under Killah     Priest's bombast, it's repetitive in the worst way, an under-the-radar nephew of every tired     loop you've heard on Urban Radio since 2000. Much more satisfying is Mex Black's ""Grass"" remix,     which pairs a haunted piano and <em>Fantasia</em> strings with flanged synths, and a sped up rip of     Priest's vocals, finding an untapped energy in his flow that makes the cut spark.  The woodwind     dancehall of Deckwrecka's remix also shines, its crown jewels the guest MCs MCD and 2Ice, with     his rough ragga growl.</p>
<p>Long the scourge of 12"" promos and import singles the world over, one third of <em>Catechism</em> is     instrumental and acapella; a potentially interesting bonus for crate diggers when spread over two     vinyl EPs, but a surefire momentum killer on one CD. It's torture enough hearing Killah Priest's weak     opening line ""I seek revenge upon the earth like Christ"" repeated a dozen times before the disc ends,     but back-to-back versions of Ward 29's pedestrian ""Runaways"" remix make for masochistic overkill.     Mex Black's contribution is begging to be heard sans vocals but, curiously, it doesn't get the     instrumental treatment.</p>
<p>What this all boils down to is a lack of invention. <em>Catechism</em> is forgettable for much of its     40 minutes, and not until the final cut does the track get a fresh, inventive interpretation     courtesy of Unreals' remix, which pushes ""Catechism"" further up the genre family tree into drum     n' bass territory. It's still a fairly safe branch to dangle from, but it works, with a droning intro,     and an increasingly aggressive high roller of a break; the track delivers, and successfully     reworks an easily missed Killah Priest boast-- ""Comin' as the ill-ass rappuh/ With that sick ass     laughtuh""-- into a crafty, memorable hook.</p>
<p>The whole point of the remix as an art form is to bring something new and personal to the table:     Dogmatic adherence to the source material isn't going to produce anything revelatory. The massive     2x12"" free-for-all on the East Flatbush Project's ""Tried by 12"" from a few years back took that     track's loping hip-hop spine and contorted it in a million directions; almost every cut was a     success. <em>Catechism</em>, despite a few solid vertebrae, is in desperate need of a chiropractor's     second opinion.</p>

Or yesterday maybe, I don't know. I got a telephone call from the house:</p><p>
    ""Andy, your father just got back from the dentist's office, and he had some very important news that I
    thought you'd like to hear.""</p><p>
    ""Uh, okay, does he have any life-threatening cavities?""</p><p>
    ""No, but the dentist warned him to stay away from whitening toothpastes and anything with abrasives in it.
    She said the worst one was that natural toothpaste you use with baking soda in it. It can scratch the enamel
    off your teeth.""</p><p>
    ""Not to worry Mom, I don't use that sort of stuff anymore. I use Hecker.""</p><p>
    ""Hecker?""</p><p>
    ""Yeah, Florian Hecker. It's by Mego.""</p><p>
    ""It's got fluoride in it? That's good, I suppose.""</p><p>
    ""No, Ma, Florian. It's not that mellow Peelu ambiance like Tim Hecker nor that cool saccharine sparkle of
    Hecker and Miss Kittin. It's not even the Aquafresh of Maximillian Hecker. This stuff is from Austria, and
    I'm not sure if it's even legal here yet.""</p><p>
    ""Are you on dope?""</p><p>
    ""Mom, this is the most abrasive shit I've ever come across! This grounds out all the enamel and bone in my
    fucking mouth, and it's just nerve-endings dangling in there now! I'll never have to brush again!""</p><p>
    She didn't want to listen to what I had to say, and you might not want to listen either, but much like last
    year's lauded (and brutally unlistenable) To Live and Shave in L.A. disc, this will be the most highly
    nuanced, insanely articulated carving and polishing of digital noise to come along this year, and Hecker
    knows it. ""But wait, what about Kevin Drumm?"" you may ask, who also placed high in these pages with a
    similarly nasty disc of white noise and black death on the same label. True, it was rough, but at least
    its heart contained the very core of rock, as its ending revealed. You could at the very least think about
    distorted guitars and be close to understanding. <i>Sun Pandämonium</i> is something else entirely, its
    computer codes and structures inscrutable through and through.</p><p>
    In what must surely be the aural equivalent of tapping the gas pedal as your buddy reaches for the door
    handle on the car, Hecker begins the disc with four minutes of toggling the on-off switch on the hyperspeed
    for ""bsf°tyk 5"" and you're uncertain whether you really want to ride or not. When ""Stocha Acid Zhook"" starts
    up, though, it is pure alien abduction, and the probes are readied for some prolonged root canal work. Holes
    are painfully drilled straight through to the cortex stem, and at the surface it seems to be done entirely
    at random, but when every single speck of toothy shrapnel and grinding spin of the diamond bit is placed
    within the extraterrestrial drone underlying it all, there is a far greater intelligence that can be
    discerned, and it's frightening. Gurgle and spit all you want, you'll be unable to evade this malevolence;
    the piercing frequencies pin you down, no matter how you writhe or turn. And just when you think the twenty
    grueling minutes of skull-trepanning might be over as the piece dies out, Hecker even gives you a fake ending
    and returns with the drill for a few minutes more! The nerves!</p><p>
    Once through the album's centerpiece, the remainder of the album spurts by quickly in minute bursts. The
    smaller fragments squiggle around a little bit more, but the refinement of each sound particle, be it a
    glitch or the digital dust shaved off of that isolated glitch, has so much meticulous gradation as to render
    every grain audible and infinite. ""Quantum Spark Reality"" melds some ungrounded pops and fluctuating hums
    into these exquisite cosmic murmurs, cutting it all with flummoxing squeals so that the experience remains
    destabilized and damaged. ""Vi Retrospect"" is lightning quick, with edgy quivers and quakes, as physically
    visceral as any vinyl scratching. As the nerves tense to the point of synapse snapping, unable to process
    it all, Hecker fizzes the track out with some outlandish twittering and dribbling.</p><p>
    It's a perfect ending, as the listening experience will do nothing if not reduce you to puddling drool at
    the end. Loud and overwhelming at any volume setting, these are the sounds and frequencies not only of
    diamonds being sharpened, but then being used to etch directly on the lenses of your optical readers. Call
    him a sick fuck, a genius, or even Mister Antichrist, but this will cleanse the audio palate as it blows
    your teeth out. Trust me.</p></div>"|3793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3793-sun-pandamonium/|8.7|Andy Beta

A percentage of
    those that actually enjoy auditory suffering argue as to whether a popular practitioner such as
    Merzbow doles out a potent and varied enough blend from album to album. Most people contend that
    if you've heard one Merzbow album, you've heard them all, but his new release <i>Merzbeat</i> might
    baffle those usually alienated by noise, as well as those who feel Merzbow is monotonous.  It will
    even surprise those who've become accustomed to the cochlea-stampeding trauma of his earlier records.</p><p>
<i>Merzbeat</i> is approachable.  There are drum beats and guitar riffs. It's been compared to Neu,
    although Tony Conrad + Faust's <i>Outside the Dream Syndicate</i> might be more apt:  A pummeling drum
    line repeats for 10 minutes, Tony Conrad's buzzing violin replaced by Merzbow's trash compactor.
    All of the anti-academic, yet still intellectualized thought regarding Merzbow's blatant, harsh
    releases is hidden within <i>Merzbeat</i>. It's still subconscious, cultural detritus, sure, but it's
    rock music first. In fact, to hell with all the Krautrock name dropping: <i>Merzbeat</i> strives
    to be <i>Led Zeppelin I</i>.</p><p>
    
    Despite these almost accessible aspirations, one could hardly say any piece of music in Merzbow's
    canon is unprecedented. <i>Merzbeat</i> is like a stripped-down <i>Aqua Necromancer</i>, a prominent,
    almost pleasurable loop underneath the sounds Merzbow is known for; <i>Necromancer</i> however is much
    harsher, and more monotonous, where <i>Merzbeat</i>, surprisingly enough, is melodically varied.
    It's a Merzbow album with near-tunes that actually change over the course of each piece.
    Factor in the fourth track, ""Tadpole""-- what might be the most traditionally beautiful piece
    of Merzmusic-- and it's hard not be optimistic about the future of Masami Akita's  work.</p><p>
<i>Merzbeat</i> is engaging, yet to laud the work as an achievement-- or even a standout
    release-- might be beside the point. For Merzbow, music is garbage: This CD is just the result of the
    wild excesses of information in our lives.  It's essentially the most accurate form of folk music
    we have.  Anyone can make noise; you just take the leftovers around you and extract sound. Make it
    loud and cathartic, or quiet and resigned:  Each Merzbow release is a call to do it yourself.
    While a similar release like Massimo's <i>Hello Dirty</i>-- which also preys on noise and rock music--
    achieves a certain artistry in the equation, the bizarrely more impressive thing about <i>Merzbeat</i> is its
    imminent disposability.</p></div>"|5245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5245-merzbeat/|6.7|Kim Shannon

    hooks, melodies so catchy you can identify the exact note or syllable that addicts you.  <i>How I Learned to
    Write Backwards</i> is the rare exception.  Never merely ""nice"" or ""fun,"" Amy Linton's songs are chiseled
    like diamonds, and set to some of the coolest arrangements ever taped in somebody's basement.</p><p>
    
    More spacious and lighter on the guitars than the Aislers Set's first two albums, <i>How I Learned to Write
    Backwards</i> shows Linton, the band's writer/producer/singer, in a full 60s pop pastiche.  You can find the
    obvious nods to Laura Nyro's stoned soul melodies and the most mesmerizing basslines ever given to Nancy
    Sinatra; ""Through the Swells"" all but rips off the bubblegum classic ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"", and
    the harmony vocals on ""Emotional Levy"" have the grace of a choir of French schoolgirls in matching soft blue
    uniforms.</p><p>
    
    Here, Linton's indie quintet becomes a pop orchestra.  The band's music is denser than ever before, laden
    with sleigh bells, handclaps and horns piled atop the conventional guitars, drums, bass and keyboards-- and
    all are drenched in cavernous reverb, providing the ambiance and intimacy of a gigantic, empty concert hall.
    And yet, this is also a noise-pop band: Beneath the layers of instrumentation, the music is propped up on
    barbed wire, unsteady and ready to topple.</p><p>
    
    The tracks are short: The single, ""Missions Bells"", is one of the few to break two minutes, and ""Langour in
    the Balcony"" seems to end before it's even started.  And the band cuts quickly from one influence to the
    next-- the gingerbread candy house of ""The Train #1"" runs into the rumbling punk guitars on ""The Train #2"";
    the massive, verbose pop of ""Attraction Action Reaction"" balances the spooky-bleak voice and barely-the-will-to-strum
    guitar on ""Unfinished Paintings"".  The noise makes the pop spark, and the soul influence makes the nervous
    energy digestible.  Linton mixes and paces all of these elements flawlessly, but what's more, the engineering
    is extraordinary for its budget, carefully crafted but fun and spontaneous.</p><p>
    
    The only problem is Linton's singing.  It's not that she's not a great singer (well, maybe partly)-- the
    issue is how she records her voice.  On almost every track, she Spectorizes herself in oblivion with effects
    and reverb added to, presumably, lend a distant and dreamy effect.  Sometimes it works (the late-night
    loneliness on ""Unfinished Paintings"" is poignant), but at other times, she sounds completely displaced.
    The most unfortunate example of this comes on the album's closer, ""Melody Not Malaise"", where the band is
    recorded with minimal post-production trickery while Linton is mixed far too low beneath the instrumentation,
    and reverbed into the stratosphere.  Maybe she's not happy with how her voice or words sound unaided, but
    I'd rather be given the opportunity to connect to them than be left guessing.</p><p>
    
    This, however, may be <i>How I Learned to Write Backwards</i>' only shortcoming, and when stacked up against
    such effortless, finely-crafted pop tracks, it almost seems trivial.  These songs are blanketed in a magnetic
    charisma, and contain a vigor and effortlessness that projects youthful vitality and a joyousness unhampered
    by looming adult concerns.  It's pure fun-- insanely, immediately likable, and ingenious in how much it
    achieves.</p></div>"|86.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/86-how-i-learned-to-write-backwards/|7.9|Chris Dahlen

Seana Carmody is trying to erase your memory of the last
    ten years, and only you can stop her!  Get out your secret decoder rings to find out how, and
    remember, all the information you're about to receive is top secret, for your eyes only, not to
    be shared with anyone-- not even your Mom and Dad.</p><p>
    
    The first letter is...wait!  What's that sound?  That beguiling sound...so clear, so...French, in a
    Bostonian kind of way.  That voice, it's calling me back to 1992, back to the days when indie rock
    was supposed to take over the world and save us all from pre-packaged blandness.  And that music, it's
    so hazy, so...swirly.</p><p>
    
    ""Rocket Out of Time"" pretty much says it all, in title and execution.  Seana Carmody's voice tumbles
    out of the speakers, dripping in ambience cooked up in some half-remembered stereolab.  I'm not sure
    if she departed from the Swirlies ten years ago or yesterday:  Her henchmen-- Orrin Anderson
    on drums and keys, and Adam Brilla on bass and ""space guitar""-- put you in double headlocks of
    strutting rhythm and shocking fuzz, driving home the auto-vehicular double entendre of the album's
    title.</p><p>
<i>Struts &amp; Shocks</i> is like the core of the Swirlies, with the apple eaten mostly off; it's
    still pretty sweet, but the seeds are mildly poisonous.  The songs that drove that first band's
    noise and experimental edge are largely swept aside, in favor of a cozier bedroom ambience.  There's
    still some racket to get the neighbors pounding on the ceiling, but it's mostly-- disarmingly--
    underplayed.</p><p>
    
    It's concise, too, plowing through ten songs in 33 minutes, eight of which are devoted to the dusty
    shoegazer mini-epic ""Stay Awake"", which closes the record in blissfully spaced out fashion.
    Other highlights include the gorgeously lopsided groove of ""Deirdre"", topped by a
    triple-tracked layer of Carmody sauce, and guitars operating at orbital zenith.  The heavenly swirl
    of ""Tornadoes"" kicks up a cloud of distortion and percussive fence posts that belies the calm of
    Carmody's delivery.</p><p>
    
    And that's part of what makes <i>Struts &amp; Shocks</i> so great: Carmody certainly recalls her
    glory days in the Swirlies, but she's the only one in the driver's seat, and brings a new focus
    to her work as a result.  All told, her plot to rob us of the last decade seems to be coming
    to fruition.  Save your old records, kids, they're the only decoder you've got.</p></div>"|1314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1314-struts-shocks/|7.4|Joe Tangari

<i>Who is Lanterna? What is </i>Sands?</p><p>
    
    Lanterna primarily solo project of Illinois-based Henry Frayne, who has played with the Moon Seven
    Times, Area, and many others.  <i>Sands</i> is the third Lanterna release, after 1995's self-titled
    debut and 2001's <i>Elm Street</i>.</p><p>
<i>What kind of music does Lanterna play?</i></p><p>
    
    If Lanterna had to filed under one category, it'd most likely be ambient,
    although that label is also inadequate: Brian Eno's famous quip that ambient music should be as
    ignorable as it is interesting applies only partially to <i>Sands</i>. Frayne adds much stronger
    rhythmic drive to his work than is typical of ambient composers; he sometimes uses a drum machine
    programmed by Steve Day, other times he employs chugging guitars, as on ""Greek Island"".</p><p>
<i>Could you tell us more about this ""Greek Island"" song?</i></p><p>
    
    Certainly, since ""Greek Island"" is perhaps the strongest track on the record. It has an elegant
    sense of movement, and surpasses the other cuts on <i>Sands</i>. Frayne tries to lend the whole
    album a cinematic sweep, but he carries it off most successfully on ""Greek Island.""</p><p>
<i>I already own an ambient album. Could you please tell me why I'd want to buy another one?</i></p><p>
    
    Perhaps you wouldn't. For some people, ambient music is nothing more than pleasant room spray for
    when they don't want something intrusive on their stereos. Other people-- let's call
    them ""fans of ambient music""-- enjoy the subtle emotional shades woven into the genre's best albums.
    On <i>Sands</i>, Frayne often hints at mood shifts that never come, casting shadows of perception
    that enrich the delicate resonance of his never obvious material. <i>Sands</i> also tends
    to grab more attention than one might expect, like Eno's <i>On Land</i>. Frayne doesn't exactly
    straddle the boundary between pop and ambient, but he does take a couple steps towards the former.</p><p>
<i>Is that good?</i></p><p>
    
    Yes and no. Frayne runs into trouble, primarily because he mandates varying degrees of attention:
    Listeners will find their expectations shifting across tempi, volume levels-- even styles-- in a short
    period of time.  <i>Sands</i> alternates between rewarding and frustrating on close listen,
    as subsequent tracks run afoul of any audience bias, whether toward ambient or pop.</p><p>
<i>I'm told the guitar sound on this album is horribly dated and retro-futuristic, that
    the drum machine sounds like it was picked up at Bobby Brown's yard sale, and that generally,
    </i><i>Sands</i> sound like the most technologically sophisticated release of 1981. Is that true?</p><p>
    
    Yes.</p><p>
<i>Why would I want to buy </i>Sands<i> in that case?</i></p><p>
    
    As the lessons of ambient music have remained all too segregated from pop, Frayne should be
    saluted for his attempt to break down the barrier between these fields. <i>Sands</i> is incrementally
    successful in doing so, and should be welcomed by anyone who likes ambient, but resents its
    limitations. Yet Frayne has the same problem as everyone from Eno onwards: how to get an
    inevitably prejudiced audience to listen to a genre whose very function is a
    drastic departure from the norm.  He hasn't solved it here, and will pay the price of marginality
    for his modest failure, but he's searching for a bridge that could connect two worlds, and as he's
    one of very few architects with a solid blueprint, you'll want to keep his card in your rolodex.</p></div>"|4687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4687-sands/|6.8|Brian James

    him great ridicule from the rest of the staunchly anti-emo Pitchfork staff.  Confronted with the dilemma
    posed by reviewing their latest album, and torn over whether to reveal his weakness for the band, or to
    verbalize the unqualified hate of the staff's collective opinion, Rob underwent what is medically known as
    a ""psychic rift.""  The tragic results are presented below.]</p><p>
<table cellpadding=""10"" cellspacing=""10"" width=""100%""><tr><td valign=""top""><div class=""reviewtext"">
    You know, if there's one band I've never liked, it's
    Rainer Maria.  Epitomizing everything wrong with the
    Midwestern emo movement of the late 90s, Rainer
    combined their diary-excerpt lyrics, dampened-punk
    sound, and pretentious aesthetic to create suffocating
    levels of melodrama that backpack drones of the Great
    Plains ate up like Doritos.  With singer Caithlin de
    Marrais wailing out her vocals like a nailgun to my
    head, and Kyle Fischer's off-tune counterpoints not
    helping matters, the poet-named trio was always near
    the top of my enemies list.<p>
    
    So it probably comes as no surprise that I find <i>Long Knives Drawn</i> to be not very good, not very good at all.</p><p>
<i>Long Knives Drawn</i> continues a direction Rainer
    first explored on 2001's <i>A Better Version of Me</i>,
    a failed experiment in shoegazer rock that replaced
    the usual cold monotone singing with impassioned capital-V
    Vocals.  The result: Decisive proof that separating the
    stretched-out chord storms and detached microphone
    work of shoegazing is like the fatal severance of
    Siamese twins.  Somehow, as weak as the band was before
    <i>A Better Version</i>, this approach made them even
    worse.</p><p>
    
    Which means it's at least a small relief that <i>Long
    Knives Drawn</i> starts out sounding more like the
    slightly more palatable early material, with the first
    three songs building to fiery peaks that are all too
    quickly abandoned.  The lyrics quickly assume the
    fetal position, however, with lines (""you need
    contact daily, or conscience is failing"") worthy
    of similarly over-serious mopester Pedro the Lion.</p><p>
    
    I could rag on the script all day, but the failings of
    <i>Long Knives Drawn</i> go beyond mere solipsism.  De
    Marrais' constant fretting about wilting love is kept
    company by Fischer's run-of-the-mill fretwork, rarely
    contributing more than a overdriven fuzztone after the
    admittedly arm-swinging ""Ears Ring"".  Stripped of the
    band's old jittery tendencies, much of the music just
    floats on by beneath de Marrais' histrionics, while a
    sat-on organ in (yipes) ""The Awful Truth of Loving""
    does little to expand their dried up sound.</p><p>
    
    Without instrumental distractions, those
    wince-inducing words just keep ringing, ringing,
    ringing in my head.  Consider the clincher on ""The
    Imperatives"", where the breathtakingly awful crowning
    statement is ""I was thinking we could go and live in a
    monastery."" </p><p>
    
    I went into <i>Long Knives Drawn</i> with, well, long
    knives drawn, but the album's complete inessentiality
    appears to even trump my considerable bias.  Admittedly,
    the record does have a few more listenable moments than
    I was initially prepared to give it credit for, but as
    a whole, the album is such a continued watering-down of
    their old sound that I find it hard to believe it would
    even appeal to the Rainer Maria faithful.  Chalk up another
    victory for the Pitchfork status quo.</p></div></td>
<td valign=""top""><div class=""reviewtext"">You know, I've got to be square with you.  I used to
    like Rainer Maria.  Having been a Midwestern teenager
    in the late 90s, square in the midst of my
    Melodramatic Period, Rainer's sense of tragic
    romanticism and ever-so-slightly math-punk sound
    was exactly what I was looking for in the late
    high-school/early college years.  Powered by the
    wonderfully wrong harmonies of singers Caithlin de
    Marrais and Kyle Fischer, the trio hit their stride
    early with their debut's opener ""Tinfoil"" and <i>Look
    Now Look Again</i>, their second and best record.<p>
    
    So you understand how I'd disappointed that <i>Long Knives Drawn</i> is not very good, not very good at all.</p><p>
    
    Though I'm not too surprised, really, after the trajectory
    suggested by their 2001 release <i>A Better Version of
    Me</i>, a highly flawed effort that found the band
    smoothing out the time-sig skips and clashing duets
    for an unsatisfying <i>Loveless</i>-lite sound.
    Largely missing Fischer's distinctive vocal
    interactions, while reflecting his increased complacency
    with sitting on single (albeit noisy) chords for
    indeterminable amounts of time, <i>A Better Version</i>
    wasn't so much deserving of scorn as it was yawningly
    bland.</p><p>
<i>Long Knives Drawn</i> at least hints at a rebound,
    starting off at an energetic clip with three songs
    which, at times, show hints of the band's old spark.
    ""Ears Ring"" even contains an abrasive riff and pessimistic
    chorus worthy of Pedro the Lion (""you need contact
    daily, or conscience is failing""), though without
    David Bazan's morose delivery, it doesn't come off
    quite so meaningful.</p><p>
    
    It's all a log roll downhill from there, though, as it
    becomes increasingly clear that Fischer isn't going
    to step to the mic, and the music isn't going to
    regain much of its previous unpredictability and kick.
    Rainer Maria doesn't even seem up to conjuring up
    much of a storm any more, ""The Double Life"" and ""The
    Imperatives"" being surprisingly tame, dampered affairs
    too lacking in boister to attract attention, and
    ""Situation Relation"" forgettably occupying the band's
    now-customary solemn, finger-picked closing track slot.</p><p>
    
    But ultimately, it's the unbearable triteness of the
    lyrics that does <i>Long Knives Drawn</i> in.  Rainer
    sympathizer as I might be, I just can't forgive lines
    like ""I think that we should go and live in a monastery""
    serving as the vocal hook without popping a Rolaid.</p><p>
    
    I went into <i>Long Knives Drawn</i> hoping for a comeback
    to justify my unpopular soft spot for Rainer Maria, but I've
    come away with all my fears about their route confirmed,
    wondering if my previous fanship was just one of those
    cheeky mistakes of youth.  Whatever the reason for my
    apathy, it's a sentiment concisely summed up by the band
    itself: ""Once there was something, and now there's just a
    piece of atmosphere.""  Chalk up another victory for the
    Pitchfork status quo.</p></div></td></tr></table></p></div>"|6671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6671-long-knives-drawn/|4.4|Rob Mitchum

Yes, he's the greatest pianist of the modern age,
    blending diverse atonal qualities with an unequivocal spryness and an effortless range of emotion, and all
    those other things that come with being a brilliant player. (Free cocktails?) But when you compare the
    sentiment in a record like <i>Nu Bop</i> to that of most 20th Century composers with a similar vision, Shipp's
    stuff just doesn't hang on the low end of the friction enough. I want his music to punch me in the face with
    its dramatic, chaotic authority. He is for the advancement of jazz. He is supposed to be the Edgard Varèse,
    the Charles Ives of our generation, goddammit, interpreting the city sounds around him through improvisation
    and a sensitive, reflective ear. Unfortunately, the purpose of his recordings-- evolving jazz by including
    its urban peers in hip-hop and electronics-- has always stopped a hair short of success. The performances
    are airtight, but the crust is soft.</p><p>
    As it turns out, one thing that was missing was Antipop Consortium, and more specifically, their unequalled,
    futuristic, split-atom beats. Up 'til now, Shipp's beat programmers have been all wrong. Past collaborators
    DJ Spooky and FLAM are decent from an electronic and an emotional standpoint, but what they've offered hasn't
    ever defied expectations. If Shipp truly wants to advance jazz into the realm of youth-popular urban culture,
    he's gotta break bread with the crazy funk, collaborate with the most innovative musicians.</p><p>
<i>Antipop vs. Matthew Shipp</i> opens with a brow-furrowed block of Shipp's piano chords cut into the
    boom-bap of the bass and hi-hat. It's an imposing, rhythm-heavy intro, and while not a complete song, its
    neon spritzes of keyboards and backwards-looped cymbals offer a clear theme of what's to come: future jazz
    in the most definitive sense. From there, Shipp's piano turns backflips all over APC's swimmy, electro-alarms.
    William Parker's bass and Shipp's low-end counter each other as Beans and Priest holler, ""Stereo! Stereo,
    Stereo! It sounds so fresh, I'll sing it once and repeat!"".  From here, the mix alternates between rap solos,
    piano solos, some loose drums, chunks of chords, sample of dogs barking (two breeds), keyboards on the
    holodeck. Shipp's piano is sampled for melody and rhythm, as much as it solos-- and even the high-end, winky
    optimism with which Shipp sometimes flirts holds up way deffer as a platform with a little electro street
    beat.</p><p>
    There's not much of that froufy shit, though; it wouldn't be an Antipop joint without their cold, twitchy
    vision: ""Svp"", ""Stream Light"" and ""Coda"", specifically, feature their marble-clinking rhythms and bleak,
    controlled atmosphere, M. Sayyid rapping with a resigned wateriness in his voice, and blooming with
    heavy-footed atonal melodies. ""Monstro City"" has a cigarette-burning be-bop vibe, lyrics unfurled like
    spoken word in tandem with clicky bongo and, yes, more gaping hunks of piano chords, teetering into a dark
    chasm of a future. This is true-blue street jazz, and you can tell it comes straight from the heart and
    head.</p><p>
    Okay, but the thing is, this is billed as an Antipop Consortium record-- their absolute last release, as a
    matter of fact, since they broke up last autumn. (R.I.P!!!) And while this is a step forward for Shipp, for
    APC, it's a side-step from their gleamingly tricked-out, beat-tweaked and freaky <i>Arrhythmia</i>. <i>Antipop
    vs. Matthew Shipp</i> is solid, yes, but the experimentation doesn't always work in their favor, and it often
    dilutes the propulsive fire beneath their final release. Then again, maybe it's appropriate that their last
    hurrah-- Antipop's final track, ""Free Hop"", has them melting scratches and turntables backwards over a
    charged improv session, marking a deflated and untimely end, for eight years was simply not enough.</p></div>"|208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/208-antipop-vs-matthew-shipp/|7.2|Julianne Shepherd

    of music I like in order to receive some recommendations. I rated a few CDs,
    checked the suggestions, then rated a few more. No matter how many records I
    rated, Amazon kept telling me I just <em>had</em> to buy Nobukazu Takemura's
    <i>Scope</i>. Curious, I clicked the link to the RealAudio clip for ""Kepler""
    and proceeded to have the kind of music listening epiphany that only comes
    along once in a great while.</p><p>
    It was like this track was designed specifically to trigger the greatest
    possible emotional response in me personally. There was the mathematical
    beauty of the repeating percussion pattern, right out of Reich's bag of
    tricks. A warm organ ran counter to this, suggesting some kind of humanity
    at the center of this perfect geometry. And then, floating on top and
    skipping along to the saddest beat I could imagine, was the voice of Aki
    Tsuyoko, chopped to pieces by the broken machines Oval introduced in the
    mid-90s. I ordered <i>Scope</i> within a few minutes, and then went back to
    this painfully brief 30-second clip several times daily until the disc arrived
    a week later.</p><p>
    I was turned on to Nobukazu Takemura by a computer algorithm. It's fitting,
    really, considering the direction his music has taken since. Starting with
    <i>Hoshi No Koe</i>, Takemura has devoted more and more energy to looking
    for the tin man's heart. I'm guessing that this particular obsession, the
    search for the emotional core of the machine, has something to with being
    raised in Japan, a country that seems very comfortable with the idea that
    robots have feelings. Through the <i>Sign</i> and <i>Mimic Robot</i> EPs
    Takemura's interest in this area continued to grow (last year's limited
    edition <i>Water's Suite</i> was clearly a detour, and was constructed from
    old material besides), and now it comes to full flower on <i>10th</i>.</p><p>
    While ""Sign"" stood out on <i>Hoshi No Koe</i> with its pop structure and
    incorporation of vocals, these elements are the norm on <i>10th</i>. This is
    an interesting development because Takemura's handling of vocals is so unique.
    The vocoder has been in regular use for more than 30 years, and in the past
    five it's become something of a cliché, but Takemura's treatments are
    original. With Takemura's music, you never get the sensation that you're
    hearing a human voice processed by a machine, the way you might with
    Kraftwerk or Air. Takemura lets the machine sing to the audience directly.
    In fact, on <i>10th</i> we're not hearing vocodered human voices, but the
    sound of a speech synthesizer originally developed for the handicapped.</p><p>
    With the human element removed from the voices on <i>10th</i>, the effect
    is ironically even greater pathos. The way Takemura positions these lonely
    robot boys and girls, we're led to believe that they might never find love.
    I only wish he'd given them better songs to sing. The musical arrangements
    are just right, consisting of his usual assortment of electronic instruments
    and percussion that sound like broken toys. Hearing these tools applied in
    the service of well-written pop songs would be divine, but the melodies, as
    performed by the speech synthesizer, just aren't moving. The tune that makes
    up ""FallsLake"" sounds like it was written on a keyboard using one finger on
    a cluster of three black keys. The slippery bass and clouds of harmonic
    distortion that make ""Wandering"" sound so damn nice are wasted when the
    singing machine comes in and pays absolutely no attention to the chords.
    ""Lost Treasure"", which appears on the <i>Mimic Robot</i> EP, is better, with
    a nice bassline, lazy, head-nodding drums, and an interesting vocal rhythm,
    but there's no possible defense for letting it stretch to nine minutes. Which
    brings us to the usual Takemura complaint: <i>10th</i> is a 16 track, 78-minute
    record. At a time when albums seem to be moving back to a more reasonable
    length, Takemura's are still pushing an hour and 20 minutes.</p><p>
    So that's the bad news. On the upside, there are a number of great tracks on
    <i>10th</i>, and all of my favorites are instrumentals. The simple and poignant
    CD skipper ""Cons"", which was also on <i>Mimic Robot</i>, still works for me. The
    textured drones of ""Mumble"" manage some interesting harmonic interplay. The
    playful and sad ""Tadasu No Mori"" sounds like a lost <i>Child's View</i> classic,
    with by far the best melody on <i>10th</i> and some compelling background voices.</p><p>
    The disappointing hit-to-miss ratio on <i>10th</i> might also have something to
    do with my introduction to Nobukazu Takemura. The sound I fell in love with
    when I first heard ""Kepler"" seems like something Takemura has lost interest
    in. But the impact of that track on me was so strong, I think of it every
    time I put on a new Takemura release. I'm always interested in what I hear
    and I often find something great (""Chrysalis"" from <i>Hoshi No Koe</i> is
    brilliant, for example), but the intensity of that one experience, I'm
    realizing, is not likely to be repeated.</p></div>"|7923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7923-10th/|6.5|Mark Richardson

It's
    so insular that its fans just call it ""pop,"" as if the word weren't already taken by the stuff on the
    <i>Billboard</i> charts.</p><p>
    
    Let me explain. The whole story started with punk, which wanted to fill itself with urgency and anger and
    Big Themes. Somewhere in the middle of that came one of the first ""indiepop"" singles: the Television
    Personalities' ""Part-Time Punks"", which consisted of three dorky kids playing a half-assed, cutesy singalong
    about the punks on the street. It was an embrace of punk's DIY ethics, but also a big ""fuck off"" to punk's
    poses: a cute little pop song existing in (and analyzing) a scene that had very little use for such things.
    This became the core idea of indiepop: In environments where everyone desperately wanted to show strength
    and style and importance, these bands thumbed their noses and thought hard about kittens. Beat Happening,
    for instance, appeared on a west-coast indie scene still preoccupied with hardcore, but they sang childlike
    songs about apple-picking and death while throwing candy to their audiences. Henry Rollins heckled them,
    and they probably threw him candy, too: What kind of idiot is too cool to like candy?</p><p>
    
    Following this stuff is a little like following pop, only in a tiny room that no one ever bothers with: It's
    all about ""legendary"" bands that only released one single, big pop-idol crushes on the women from Heavenly,
    endless mixtapes and little social scenes. So long as no one is watching, the fans can trade seven-inches
    in peace, in a realm that runs solely on their own enthusiasm: The whole thing is like a grand experiment in
    the ""indie"" idea of how bands should relate to listeners. But this is exactly what's led the genre to the
    depths of self-parody it currently wallows in: When everyone's happy to party in the same closet, no one
    bothers with quality control. At this late date most of the bands are just being cute for its own sake,
    writing still more songs about having crushes on one another, or deciding, to all appearances, that writing
    decent songs is no longer even necessary.  Many have forgotten the key thing their precursors knew: That pop
    can be catchy but still serious, pissy, even sinister.</p><p>
    
    And then there's Boyracer. In this little indiepop world, Boyracer is an institution-- maybe not The Beatles,
    but The Kinks, at least. Stewart Anderson, the group's only permanent member, has buzzed and shambled his way
    across more than a decade so far, releasing precious few full-lengths but a daunting array of singles, EPs,
    compilation tracks, and collections, all against a constantly mutating backdrop of band members and solo
    projects. This is the ""legendary"" Stewart Boyracer-- one friendly English guy with a mangled guitar and
    a revolving-door band spilling forth scattershot strings of bashed-out lo-fi pop songs. Indie rock fans might
    think that sounds like someone familiar, and it should: Bob Pollard and Guided by Voices have been travelling
    this road for just as long.</p><p>
    
    The differences, though, are all content. Guided by Voices create a world of dirty-haired guys drinking cheap
    beer, of ""serious"" rock tropes, of obtuse, impressionistic lyrics. Boyracer's world is less skeptical: Just
    boys and girls excitedly bashing out the sort of pop that makes you bounce, the sort where clever knife-sharp
    lyrics about the everyday world of that latest crush will always beat vague stuff about blimps and robots.
    And that's exactly what you get here: twenty-odd tracks of speedy bopalong pop songs, all reckless and
    lo-fi, covered in noise and rigged together with duct tape. You get people attacking drum sets like
    eager kids; you get Stewart strumming guitars unbelievably fast; you get him and bandmate Jen calling
    ""Tell me where my hands should go!"" in enthusiastic unison right before overfuzzy bass and handclaps
    roll in. You get wistful bedroom duets that end with the sound of a teakettle coming to boil; you get an
    answering machine message in which an irate record-pressing rep tries unconvincingly to sound threatening
    and calls Stewart a bitch; you get ridiculously lovely covers of pop landmarks The Primitives and The Marine
    Girls.</p><p>
    
    You get, in essence, what so much of indiepop has forgotten: That the point isn't just to be sweet and
    congratulate yourself for it, but to make sweetness powerful, to make it say something. Stewart understands
    this. He understands simpler issues, too, like how to write good songs (the hooks and structures here are
    consistently devastating), and how to just plain rock (or rather ""pop"": this album reminds me why The Wedding
    Present were once considered part of this genre). But mostly he gets how this stuff can work, how he can sit
    behind drum sets and guitars and have fun with you, or how he can set up a four-track somewhere and offer
    you a picturesque slice of the life he happens to lead: ""Are you still defending him?"" he begins one song.
    ""Is he still ruining your art-rock band?""</p><p>
    
    Wipe away all those pretensions to being ""avant-garde"" and it's the entire concept of ""indie"" in one album.
    Plus about a million great hooks. Indiepop is insular, yeah, but if there's any album in the genre right now
    that can toss that aside and offer something to people who couldn't care less about Tiger Trap, this is it.</p></div>"|898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/898-to-get-a-better-hold-youve-got-to-loosen-yr-grip/|8.5|Nitsuh Abebe

Or, even better: when you buy an unlabeled cassette at a thrift     store, which, when played, consists of some guy talking to himself-- thinking no one will ever hear the tape,     he's completely uninhibited, and by extension, genius.  That's pretty much <em>The Weather</em>.  It sounds     like Daedelus, Bus and Radioinactive drank sick amounts of cola and recorded this album in their boxers.     It's pleasantly casual, as if intended solely for their own entertainment.  Bus and Radio are like, ""Fuck     it, we are theatrical hams, and now we're gonna freestyle/sing over this tweaky exotica track Daedelus     crunched and mashed for us."" Whacked-out humor, clever beats, and incomprehensible free-association abound,     and it's awesomely pure, like the triumphant stink of a 12-year-old-boy's socks. You can't expect anything     else from three guys calling themselves ""America's favorite boy band.""</p><p>Daedelus drops his Kinderegg production, slipping loping beats inside candied organ, wispy string samples,     and the occasional launch into futuristic feedback-- it's an early 70s variety-show backdrop similar to the     one on Radioinactive's <em>Pyramidi</em>, but far more playful. It also helps that Los Angeles' Busdriver is     among the most inventive emcees around right now, forging new directions in style (he's nasally, jazzy, and     rhymes faster than anyone) and lyricism: ""You are confusing that Mercedes emblem for a peace sign/ And I'm     mistaking that peace sign for a crosshair."" (If you're desperate for a follow-up to his mind-exploding last     record, though, Bus doesn't cut quite as sharp on <em>The Weather</em> as on <em>Temporary Forever</em>.)</p><p>On the opener, ""Exaggerated Joy"", Radioinactive rhymes, ""Laundering money in Laundromats, here is detergent,""     after which Bus sings a really funny, Michael Jackson-esque ""ah!"", sans irony, that's more suited for a sexy     funk jam than the calliope-sounding rap presented. Sugar-fueled lyrics are alternately multi-layered and     brilliant, and utterly incoherent. Example: The line, ""Just because the world runs on oil doesn't mean oilmen     should run the world,"" is an astute, assertive and clever play on words, followed by, ""Just because the sky's     my paved road doesn't mean you should pave a road over the sky."" Um, what?</p>
<p>But it's not, like, a comedy album, nor is its wackiness cLOUDDEAD redux.  These three state their mission     clearly in a theme song of sorts, ""Carl Weathers"": ""We're too old to smoke blunts, so we promote funk that     makes adults hump. We catapult jump."" Warm bass and a voice sing softly behind them: ""Partly cloudy with an     increased chance of rain."" <em>The Weather</em> is smart but not pretentious, skeptical but not misanthropic,     and it proves avant-hiphop doesn't have to be avant-crappy.</p>

    make me an expert on dinosaurs?   No, it does not.  If you get members of Antipop Consortium and Anticon to
    rap on your album, does that change the fact that you've just released what amounts to a stale, heavy-handed
    trance record?  No, it does not.  Fortunately, there are enough pterodactyls flying around going ""AAAHK!
    WAAHK!"" on DJ Krush's seventh full-length, <i>The Message at the Depth</i>, that if all else fails (and
    it does), he can at least pretend that this album was 65 million years before its time.</p><p>
    
    It reminds you of.<br/>
    You know. Those raves you went to.<br/>
    In, like, the 90s.<br/>
<i>(haiku)</i></p><p>
    
    Krush's beats are just unbelievably stale here, but that's not this record's only problem (even if it is
    its most immediate).  It's the studied melodrama with which he introduces every echoing layer of synth
    debris at the exact correct, premeditated machination of a tom trill.  And the songs don't go <i>anywhere</i>.
    He sounds like he's either bored and cranking this shit out or trying to prove how spooky he is.  For his
    sixth album in a row.</p><p>
    
    Fractals. So profound!<br/>
    The beats. So heavy-hitting!<br/>
    Just one, wing, flapping.</p><p>
    
    DJ Krush is hellbent on illustrating his own interpretation of HELL: a war-torn, apocalyptic world based
    on history and current events that also falls in line with the premise of many a Manga. Good. Evil. Their
    timeless, endless battle. But the biggest flaw here is that there's just no <i>good</i> to drive home
    <i>The Message at the Depth</i>'s evil.  This record relies on the sorriest aural metaphors, the saddest
    cliches of late-90s electronica: Krush even employs a recurring theme of a black hole to illustrate war
    and destruction.  It seethes and sucks beneath Anticon's anti-G.W. rants, the cocky hair-flipping diva
    crooning about Hiroshima on ""Alephevo (Truthspeaking)"", and ""What About Tomorrow"", this album's triumphant
    look towards the future.  It's just so fuckin' hammy!  He tries so hard, but just Beats! You! Over!
    The! Head!  This stuff is way too dense, with no respite and no real crescendo. Remember, there ain't no
    hell without a heaven, no yin without a yang. There ain't no midlife-crisis sax solo straight out of a
    Bravo channel commercial on ""But the World Moves One"" without a chick listening to it on her headphones
    3,000 miles away and rolling her eyes.</p><p>
    
    YO. CAN YOU FEEL IT?<br/>
    DJ Krush is in the vortex.<br/>
    So medium-rare.</p><p>
    
    The one moment of release on <i>Message</i> comes in the second half of ""Song for John Walker"", a track
    smoothed out with undeniably great lyrics: ""He wanted Hammer pants, he joined the Taliban,"" spits Doseone,
    in a surprisingly abrasive and uncharacteristically agitated tone. ""He sought an absolute truth, the alfa
    clech/ But he got the omega and bucked/ How many more humans will wear gun spit in their guts?""  The relief
    comes when Anticon's Pedestrian, Sole, Why?, Alias, Passage and Dose spiral into their signature, drugged-out
    spoken-harmony-- a rare placement of feather lightness on a record even Antipop Consortium's stellar diction
    can't save. But it lasts only a second, a pinhole of supernova in a vast universe anchored by Krush's
    murderous concrete-block beats.</p></div>"|2364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2364-the-message-at-the-depth/|4.2|Julianne Shepherd

    Later on, we'll be corralling steers into the pen, watering horses and tending to repairs--
    I hope you didn't expect this to be easy work!  But it ain't all backbreakin' labor out
    here on the range; come evenin' we'll have a good, old-fashioned cowboy campfire, eat some
    good Tex-Mex grub, and sing some of those good ol' prairie songs.  After that, we'll drop
    some acid and hit the waves at high tide-- that's when the surfin's best!</p><p>
    
    Toronto's Sadies see no barriers between old-fashioned country 'n' western, Duane Eddy surf
    rave-ups and freaky psychedelic rock.  If they perceive distance between those sounds at
    all, they've attempted to traverse it on their fourth album, <i>Stories Often Told</i>.
    The album feels like a step toward something more complete, as though the one that follows
    it will deliver the fully functioning Frankenstein they're trying to animate.</p><p>
<i>Stories Often Told</i> opens up with one of several widescreen blasts of spray and sea foam, drenching
    the quartet's twang in deep reverb.  The galloping rhythms underneath are about halfway between
    John Wayne and Annette Funicello, if you can imagine it.  Waves wash over the record constantly, but
    they're most enjoyable in concentrated bursts: Tight surf instrumentals like the graceful
    waltz ""A#1"" and ""Monkey &amp; Cork"" are the most easily enjoyable songs here.  ""Mile Over Mecca""
    is a change of pace, and one of the most interesting songs the Sadies have done yet, submerging a
    slower surf melody under Rio Grande horns and psychedelic ambience.</p><p>
    
    The Sadies stumble when they sit down around the proverbial fire to crank out old-fashioned C &amp; W.
    They're not bad as a country band, but the album is bogged down by the slower tempos and
    under-developed melodies in songs like the pedal-steel ""Such a Little Word"", or their limp duet
    ""A Steep Climb"".  When these country leanings collide with their surf jones, the results are
    fantastic, especially on the loping ""Oak Ridges"", where Dallas Good's Johnny Cash baritone sounds
    right at home amongst huge twang guitars.  The shuffling folk of ""The Story's Often Told"" works the
    combination more subtly, transferring the sheets of reverb over to the steel guitar, which enshrouds
    the dusty campfire ballad in a gossamer cloud.</p><p>
    
    Their biggest departure is undoubtedly ""Of Our Land"", which starts with a guitar progression
    exactly like the beginning of  ""Stairway to Heaven"", then cuts off a credible slice of gnomes &amp;
    fairies psych-rock, served up smothered in more reverb and phaser.  To call it an entirely
    successful detour into psychedelia would be an overstatement-- it's not quite focused enough to
    be truly great-- but it's certainly entertaining, not to mention entirely unexpected.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, the Sadies seem just a touch away from creating a viable, unique genre, and I'll be
    dead honest with you: I would buy an album of psychedelic cowboy surf rock.  If you think that
    prospect sounds appealing-- if you were raised on the Butthole Surfers and wondered when their
    insanity would come home to roost-- <i>Stories Often Told</i> is worth a listen.  Their genre
    synthesis isn't quite complete, but it's getting there, which is often half the fun.</p></div>"|6963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6963-stories-often-told/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    &gt;&gt; Critical Reading:</p><p>
<i>Hello Dirty</i> is a surprising effort by Sicilian Massimo Sapienza.  His <i>Hey Babe, Let Me See Your
    USB and I'll Show You My Firewire</i> LP, while dealing with similarly sexually explicit subject matter,
    hardly compares for the potent revelations on <i>Hello Dirty</i>. With so much electronic music substituting
    morality and personality with Deleuzeian theory, Massimo's release comes at precisely the right time.</p><p>
    
    Steeped in the extremism and nihilism of noise music, Massimo has developed a unique hybrid between the
    language of DSP noise and popular culture. Yet, unlike so many other releases, rather than focusing on
    sweetness and melody of pop music, Massimo seems to be grasping for rock instead. He is reaching for the
    hormones, and grinding eroticism, choosing to tessellate the results though his computer.</p><p>
    
    This might be the first experimental electronic album intended specifically for the fed-up, sex-deprived
    teenager, rather than the intellectual college student. All of those confused feelings of apocalypse and
    libidinal appetite stand in staunch opposition to the sugar-coated nostalgia of many of Massimo's colleagues.
    This is not to say <i>Hello Dirty</i> is a thoughtless album, however; by the last track, the primordial
    sludge shifts into a sharp, distorted parody of electronic dance music. It is relegated to the same message
    as rock music: Go out and fuck.</p><p>
<i>Hello Dirty</i> is about reveling in an uncivilized part of yourself, the part of you that likes to break
    expensive furniture, the person you were before you were sensitive and accommodating. It's a temper tantrum,
    filled to its histrionic brim with sincerity. <i>Hello Dirty</i> is more alienating than any punk or hardcore
    album you're going to hear this year, and there's a good chance that it will be a sight more cathartic, as
    well.</p><p>
    
    &gt;&gt; Conclusion</p><p>
    
    1. The primary function of this essay is to:</p><p>
    
    A. Give more acclaim to the already regularly lauded Mego label.<br/>
    B. Sway the reader to buy a copy <i>Hello Dirty</i>, and truly challenge his or her ears for what might be
    the first time this year.<br/>
    C. Present Massimo as an immature misogynist hiding behind a computer.<br/>
    D. Use some avant-garde electronic buzzwords to give Pitchfork additional, unnecessary indie credibility.</p><p>
    
    Score: 8.1.  Maybe now Massimo will be able to get into a good Ivy League college and find a nice girl who
    appreciates brooding young men, and finally start programming his high-concept album about Leibniz's
    <i>Monadology</i>.</p></div>"|5132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5132-hello-dirty/|8.1|Kim Shannon

    Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"".  He was there, in 1969, when the Rolling Stones were recording
    ""Wild Horses"".  He was there, in 1974, taping the drugged disintegration of Big Star's
    <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>. And he was there, stringing out Spiritualized's <i>Ladies and Gentlemen,
    We Are Floating in Space</i>. From 1969 to 1999, he was there, with Pet Clark, the Flamin' Groovies,
    Sam and Dave, Mudhoney, Primal Scream, Ry Cooder, Bob Dylan.  He recorded and played with them all.</p><p>
    But Dickinson was there long before those more popular artists, going by his full Christian name
    and digging in the Memphis humus for some ""self-buried dope by motorcycle moonlight,"" with his band,
    the Dixie Flyers (the house band for many late sixties Atlantic artists, second only to the Muscle
    Shoals crew).  Thirty years later, his dope is again unearthed, and the vintage is quite potent,
    if not a bit ragged.</p><p>
    ""Wine"" cracks it all open, an ode to potables that leans heavily on ""Wine Spodee-Odee"" for support, but
    cuts loose with a drunken bottleneck slide flashing into white-lightning blindness at each break. The
    raucousness is palpable, barely controlled in the bellowed choruses and clouds of sawdust.
    The sluggish, morning-after regret ""The Strength of Love"" is soused with the kind of heavy molasses that
    coated Elvis' pill-popping gospel material, sung in the sort of preachy baritone Nick Cave's invoked
    in recent years.  ""Wild Bill Jones"" is back on the bottle, with throat-scratched choruses from his
    cronies, strumming and slurring like it's a juke-joint's last call.</p><p>
    The centerpiece of the disc is ""John Brown,"" an early Bob Dylan tune rendered unrecognizable-- much
    like the title character-- by heavy processing and some swamp gas bass. A churning, surly
    six-minute take, the synth simmers like bile midway through, and Dickinson's voice turns as
    foreboding as Jim Morrison's drawl. It's curiously psychedelic, in the sense that it unlocks a
    region of the mind seldom explored, and looses the darkness found there in a most horrific way.</p><p>
    The talent that led to Dickinson's status as highly-sought producer in later years is his inherent
    grasp of ancient American folk forms, and his ability to invoke them in present times, allowing
    the ghosts to swirl about in other people's songs, be they by Dylan, Carl Perkins, or even a
    little known piece archived by a New Orleans dentist and musicologist.  ""O How She Dances"" staggers
    on by way of dobro, rattle, and talking drum, channeling sinister turn-of-the-century carny snarls
    and the freakish sneer of proto-rockabilly Harmonica Frank Floyd in its brief three minutes.</p><p>
    With a nod to Memphis blues legend Furry Lewis, Dickinson and what's left of the band fire up the
    train for ""Casey Jones"", taking it for a loopy, acoustic ride that brings this strange musical trip
    to a surprisingly mellow end, considering it's about a train wreck and all. Most of the individuals
    involved with this record wound up with some serious drug problems during and after the recording;
    it would take Dickinson himself until 2001 to get to his follow-up, <i>Free Beer Tomorrow</i>.</p><p>
    Part evening porch blues, part Saturday night rave-up, and part Sunday morning hangover prayer,
    <i>Dixie Fried</i> doesn't stand alongside wasted white-boy classics like sideman Dr. John's
    <i>Gris-Gris</i> or the Stones' <i>Exile on Main Street</i>.  It doesn't approach <i>Third/Sister
    Lovers</i> either, but like Dickinson himself, it's close by.  Without restraint or focus,
    his band fell apart around him as he tried to put his possessed vision to tape.  Dickinson rooted
    for an essential drug outside of time on this record, a high to illuminate the exact moment when
    ether and molecules become definable sound, to capture the space between singing and song.</p></div>"|2305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2305-dixie-fried/|7.7|Andy Beta

    going their separate ways, and Simple
    Minds start up with ""(Don't You) Forget About Me."" I decided then that it would
    be forever my quest to seek out theme
    music for my life, so I could try to be as cool as Judd Nelson, or at least as cute as
    Molly Ringwald. You know, like a perfect cue-in of ""Godzilla"" as I
    suddenly lurch from the bar, my intoxication reaching that pinnacle where all
    reason and coordination evaporates. Yeah. That would be cool. Heh-heh.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to Banco De Gaia's <i>Big Men Cry</i>. I saw the cover and thought,
    ""Well, I'm a big man, and I cry, at least when they pre-empt episodes of <i>Star
    Trek Deep Space 9</i>... maybe."" To be sure, I could easily picture myself,
    strutting through Wal-Mart, snapping my fingers and scoping-out all of the retail
    princesses as ""Drippy"" grooves on, with it's bongoed layers of percussion and
    trampling samples of voices, laughter and tribal instruments, yeah -- ""Hey baby!""
    And ""Celestine"", which by the way also features sax by Dick Parry
    (who also did sax on Pink Floyd's <i>Wish You Were Here</i> and <i>Dark Side Of The Moon</i>), that's got my
    remnants of sweaty, teenage uncertainty and doubt written all over its
    Floydian influences. And the galumping, sinisterly trippy ""Drunk As A Monk"" may as well be
    automatically appropriated for the weekend I spent on mushrooms where my buddy
    fell under the delusion I was gay and trying to fuck him. Finally, (no, I'm not
    going to biographasize the entire album), we come to ""Big Men Cry,"" which could
    indeed be the soundtrack to the end of any of my many failed relationships, or at
    least the ones I imagine when I'm watching <i>Dharma and Greg</i>. In short, this
    is a beautiful album filled with complex soundscapes, piles of rich and delightful
    sampling and beats, mellow yet interesting and worth your time if you're patient
    enough to wait through each of the album's seven long tracks. Not unlike Loop Guru's
    <i>Loop Bites Dog</i>, just a little more finicky and a little less poppy and ironic.
    Ladies, if this happens to also be the soundtrack to your life, you can find my

    lot of time splashing around in the musical backwaters of the sixties and seventies, soaking up records
    like ""The Little Black Egg"", whose earnest failure to win widespread acceptance finds a more
    self-conscious articulation in this modern resurrection. The Rockets position themselves as defiant
    outsiders, kids who look on with a mixture of jealousy and disgust at their popular counterparts. This
    snooty imagery is aided by the fact that the band are still teenagers and sing about the sometimes
    petty concerns of their age.  Though the world would scarcely be a poorer place if all the collected
    teen angst were swept into the Atlantic, the Pocket Rockets are at least intriguing enough to make
    you think twice before you break out the push brooms.</p><p>
<i>Love or Perish</i> announces itself as lo-fi early on, but despite the inevitable accompaniment
    of insularity, bratty sneers and hiss flatter the music more often than not. The Rockets seem as if
    they're coming in from far away, like a radio station that barely comes in as you drive through a
    spooky small town late at night. There's something penetratingly strange about their songs, as their
    straight pop becomes unintentionally twisted in the process of trying to play it well. All three
    members-- Carmen Clark on vocals and bass, Lili Schulder on guitar, and Mat Lewis on drums-- are much
    longer on imagination than chops, and this gives them a naïve if not quite primitive quality. With
    such limited artifice at their command, it's natural that <i>Love or Perish sounds less like an
    album than a diary, with all the strengths and weaknesses of unrestrained exhibition.</i></p><p>
    Periodically egocentric, cliched and clumsy-- ""Cookie Blows a Fag"" is a tipsy, more leaden
    ""Arnold Layne"" if ever there was one-- <i>Love or Perish</i> has its selling points. In addition
    to plucky songwriting, its sheer honesty offers a voyeuristic thrill: Clark sounds naked to the
    point of sexual,  even when her subjects are far removed from impure thoughts.  She reveals the
    good and the embarrassing in equal measure, but the more blushingly confessional she gets, the more
    candid, unrefined and gloriously nasty the record sounds.</p><p>
    Pocket Rockets should be given points for rawness, but they might gain or lose a few depending on
    whether they chose rawness or it chose them.  A major question remains: How will an audience receive
    them in the bitchy, trendy world they tread?  With the more bluesy garage revivals, singers recite
    their problems for the sake of the audience, for explanation and ensuing empathy.  Robert Johnson
    would interject, ""You know what I'm talkin' 'bout,"" and you would. The Pocket Rockets don't
    appear to care if you know what they're talkin' 'bout: Their music is not designed to be universal,
    rather firmly personal, and without apologies. Whether this strikes you as solipsistic or bold
    depends on your proximity to the band's point of view. Either a quintessential cult record or another
    cocky slice of childish bombast, <i>Love or Perish</i> is still a more personal confession than many
    of its posey peers.</p></div>"|6360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6360-love-or-perish/|7.0|Brian James
