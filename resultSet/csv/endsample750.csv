Fitting for a bunch of dudes whose credo is some sort of mystical mumbo jumbo of cosmic love, fantasy animals, sci-fi weirdness, and-- as the new album expounds on-- space pilgrimages in search of world peace and harmony. And yet, I think they're serious! These love-in rambles only give the ballistic tunes that much more cheeky appeal. For their third full-length, <em>The Family Album</em>, AA continue their psychedelic aural terror, but dig deeper into the annals of kraut and classic rockdom.</p><p>No doubt influenced by extremo screamo acts like Blood Brothers, At the Drive-In, and the Locust, their breakout EP <em>We Are the Lazer Viking</em>-- and to a lesser extent their second full-length, <em>Blessphemy... of the Peace Beast Feastgiver and the Bear Warp Kumite</em>-- displayed a grindcore/prog-rock hybrid with lots of new-wave synths and dancey spastic grooves. Whereas <em>Blessphemy</em> turned away from the new wave-y stylings in lieu of more organ sounds (Farfisa and Hammond B3) and space synths (Moog and Korg), <em>Family</em> expands on this golden age of keyboard rock (ELP, Deep Purple, King Crimson, Yes). If it weren't for the numbers-crunching turbo drumming, the engine of this operation would have to be keyboardist Phillip Price who seamlessly alternates between sleek interstellar atmospherics, shrieking dissonant attacks, rolling vamps, and carnival-esque monkey grinds. Take ""...And Now Emerges The Silver Pilgrim"", a sideways butt-shakin' number that vibes Arab on Radar (surely another big influence) but within its short two-minute run, flips between Herbie Hancock-like DayGlo splats and three-ringed clown-car chasing.</p><p>The biggest change in the songs is the way they take already overstuffed freak outs-- usually averaging two and a half minutes-- and add even more textures to ramp up the epic feel: Album closer ""3,000 Light Years By Way of the Spacehawk"" (one of two songs clocking in over six minutes) adds a string section to the cacophony of vocalist Eddie B. Gieda III's bird-like squawk and the band's space truckin' rumble. ""The Psychonaut &amp; The Rustbelt"" explores a kind of Oingo Boingo vaudevillian boogie complete with saxophone, death-metal blast beats, and Gieda's David Yow-channeling howls; and ""A Convivial Feast of the Peace Beast"" highlights ""Riverdance""-on-meth jigs with xylophone sprinkles. Album showpiece ""The Hymn of the Angel People"" pairs more turbo circus music with highbrow art rock: Halfway through the jam, things unravel into a tranquil angelic keyboard-and-saxophone-driven celestial hum where the band ethos gets pontificated by a British-accented poetry-reciting female. Not your dad's prog rock, but equally as smart and a damn sight more engaging.</p></div>"|12574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12574-the-an-albatross-family-album/|7.5|D. Shawn Bosler

But there's something about the way Boston trio Pretty &amp; Nice re-imagine the playfully manic, barbed-wire sounds of Devo, XTC, and <em>This Year's Model</em>-era Elvis Costello. Their approach is so guileless and giddy, you'll get drunk on that spazzy, sneering sound all over again. Though the rousing, delightfully messy songs on their sophomore album (their first for Sub Pop affiliate Hardly Art) are neither pretty nor nice, they do show off some masterfully economical riffs and herky-jerky (if not outright dance-y) rhythms. <em>Get Young,</em> which clocks in under 28 minutes, swells with energy and amphetamine-addled pop hooks, making it hard to ignore and near impossible not to like.</p><p>More insistent and deliberately aggressive than the tunes they are modeled after, <em>Get Young</em>'s tracks spit their muscular guitars out in percussive bursts, teasing listeners with a playful Jam-like melody or some flirty/flinty synthesized textures. But then, lest they sound too likeably pop, P&amp;N wrap their songs in antagonistically tinny production that leaves them buzzy, muddy, and intentionally amateurish-sounding. Frontman Holden Lewis can't help that his reedy voice recalls Elvis Costello's (though he certainly could avoid the faux-British pronunciation), but it can make it hard to not see every song in light of the comparison. ""Tora Tora Tora"", with its choppy staccatos, sing-along chorus, and churning keyboards, admittedly owes more of a debt to the rhythmic weirdness of Devo. But the way that Lewis delivers his words, with that familiar demanding foghorn of a voice, he may as well be singing ""Radio, Radio"".</p><p>But Pretty &amp; Nice modernize their sound with computer-age flourishes. Songs like ""Hideaway Tokyo"" and ""Grab Your Nets"" bury a bleeping Nintendo soundtrack underneath their breakneck rhythms and prickly guitars, as if the Attractions added a game of <em>Tetris</em> as their secret mechanical fourth member. And with their fuzzy, blown-speaker frequencies, the keyboards often recall the screaming feedback of Justice's synths rather than the hollowed out 1980s versions of their heroes. Likewise, ""Peekaboo"" is a nice surprise, breaking up the album's disorienting rhythms and shout-singing with its easy, dreamy pulse. On that track Lewis' wispy falsetto spills over thrifty guitar strumming and drummer Bobby Landry's gentle-heartbeat percussion. Pausing for such a break three songs into their throttling collection, Pretty &amp; Nice give you just enough time to catch your breath and give into the reverberating loveliness before diving back into the fray at a pulse-racing pace.</p>
<p>It makes sense, then, that their album's title is a demand. It's not <em>We Are Young</em> or <em>You Are Young</em> or even <em>Being Young</em>; it's <em>Get Young</em>, the imperative. Pretty &amp; Nice's songs challenge listeners to keep up with their blasts of catchy melody purposely obfuscated by noisy clatter or aggressive chugging. ""Get with it,"" the collection seems to insist. ""Give in, don't be such an adult!"" Some who won't like <em>Get Young</em> are probably too grown up for its enchantingly juvenile thrill ride, but there's something to be said for taking the album's titular advice to heart.</p></div>"|12563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12563-get-young/|7.2|Rebecca Raber

But say that something sounds like California rock circa the 1960s or early 70s, and people have a pretty good idea what you're talking about. The Golden State band Golden Animals mine that particular epoch of mild psych and blues rock-- especially the middle part, when 60s idealism gave way to the dope-daze haze of the 70s-- for all it's worth on <em>Free Your Mind and Win a Pony</em>, the duo's solid enough debut. What possessed guitarist Tommy Eisner (originally from Baltimore) and drummer Linda Beecroft (from Sweden) to specifically aim for the Doors above all else could well be a mix of laziness and audacity. Yet the music here is really-- to paraphrase Robert Christgau tackling the Cult aping Led Zeppelin-- the Doors simplified, with the band hitting all the major beats but falling short of anything cosmic.</p><p>Whether this is by design or default is up for debate, but it does allow the group to skirt some of the many pitfalls that felled the Doors. In 2009, several of Jim Morrison's most glaring pretensions have been diffused by decades of parody (and this heaped upon his own tragic tendency toward self-parody); his moan remains a sort of shorthand for the milieu that countless bands-- cool and lame alike-- have mimicked or mocked. Where Eisner falls on the sincerity scale is anyone's guess, but certainly a few times over the course of the disc's brisk runtime you can almost sense the glint of a slight grin, as if he realizes the band is essentially a big goof and he's relishing the retread experience.</p><p>You can't turn back time, but songs such as ""I Want You to Come"" and ""Queen Mary (The Flop)"" are so fully of another age that the approximation is just as fun as it is uncanny. You can thank producer Chris Coady for that, or just as likely Thom Monahan for his retro mix assist. Heck, you could even credit hippie-cult author Gordon Kennedy, whose Salton Sea home Eisner and Beecroft supposedly house-sat during the making of this record, a home apparently packed with Aquarian Age artifacts and LPs. But most of all you can thank Eisner and Beecroft for recognizing that to do this kind of thing right, you have to dive in wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>It also helps that Eisner and Beecroft pilfer 60s signifiers but avoid borrowing some of the time's hoarier freak-out clich√©s. Indeed, if the Doors are reference no. 1, no. 2 are any number of blues-rock bands who knew that the power of a good searing lead or slide guitar trumps wacky hallucinogenic gimmicks any day.  The mojo the pair capture on even a short track like ""Alice"" is impressive, and even if it doesn't sound like enough to sustain much more than a single album's worth of rearview mirror novelty, it's more than enough to sustain these 30 minutes of entertaining nostalgia.</p></div>"|12571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12571-free-your-mind-and-win-a-pony/|6.1|Joshua Klein

Famously: Singer and songwriter Justin Vernon curled up in a ""remote northern Wisconsin cabin"" for three epic, torturous months of post-heartbreak introspection/catharsis, writing the songs which would ultimately comprise his first solo album. <i>For Emma</i> was self-released by Vernon before being picked up by Jagjaguwar and afforded a proper launch; grateful listeners swooned and shivered, circling the record like kids around a bonfire. <i>For Emma</i> became synonymous with dark winter ennui: the musical translation of earth's cruelest season.</p>
<p>By the end of 2008, Bon Iver-- along with similarly bearded, folk-minded acts like Fleet Foxes-- became emblematic of a new, woodsier trend in indie rock. Although it boasted its own brand of (presumably unintentional) theater, <i>For Emma</i> was frequently cited as an antidote of sorts to Auto-Tuned, vocoder-laden pop. It seems particularly skewering, then, that Bon Iver's four-song follow-up-- the <i>Blood Bank</i> EP-- closes with a long, a cappella<i> </i>folk song wherein Vernon's voice is so aggressively filtered through a vocoder that you're likely to back off the stereo and double-check the contents of your drink.</p>
<p>Recorded in four different locations at varying times (from December 2006 through June 2008, in an assortment of apartments, roads, hunting lodges, and studios), <i>Blood Bank</i>'s A-side (""Blood Bank"", ""Beach Baby"") is considerably less jarring than its second half, although neither feels unprecedented-- while Vernon wrote these songs to be played with a band (unlike on <i>For Emma</i>, Vernon's got two steady backers here), the EP is still imbued with all the intimacy and desperation that made <i>For Emma</i> so beloved.</p>
<p>""Blood Bank"" opens with prodding acoustic strums and a series of hushed ""oohs"" (unmistakably reminiscent of Iron and Wine's lo-fi debut, <i>The Creek Drank the Cradle</i>), before Vernon begins: ""I met you at the blood bank, we were looking at the bags,"" he explains, tossing off the kind of opening sentence most aspiring novelists spend their whole lives praying for. ""Beach Baby"", with its steel guitar and stomach-punching lyrics (""When you're out, tell your lucky one to know that you'll leave/ But don't you lock when you're fleeing, I'd like not to hear keys"") feels spare and fleeting, disappearing into the runout groove before you realize it's over.</p>
<p>""Babys"" features a prickly, unrelenting keyboard riff and a curiously zoological refrain (""Summer comes, to multiply!"") but ""Woods"" is the most intriguing cut here: For armchairists prone to detached psychoanalysis, <i>For Emma</i>'s legend might suggest that Vernon has a penchant for escapism, and there's no easier way to eschew the crags of your own voice than by piling on studio effects. Vocoder isn't exactly a shack in the mountains, but, when employed to excess, it's about as close as a vocalist can get to going off-grid. Still, ""Woods"" feels like more of a formal experiment than an emotional one, and the results are oddly and unexpectedly stunning.  Vernon's folksinger-in-a-cabin origins might not be exceptional, but ""Woods"" sort of is-- it's disorienting and delicate, a mix of Vernon's staunchly organic vocals and otherworldly effects, punctuated, on occasion, by sharp, falsetto howls. It's the kind of thing that sounds hideous on paper, but eventually coalesces in practice; ironically, the Auto-Tune serves as more of a muddler than a safety net, and without it, it's hard to know if ""Woods"" would feel so intoxicating.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Blood Bank</i> certainly dispels concerns that Vernon's accomplishment was somehow environmental-- that <i>For Emma</i>'s poetic circumstances, and not its contents, were responsible for its success. <i>Blood Bank</i> is still a wintry record-- there's snow on the cover, and lyrics about snow, and, if you listen on vinyl, the metaphorical snow of hissing surface noise-- but Bon Iver is hardly a seasonal taste.</p></div>"|12581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12581-blood-bank-ep/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

But no, <em>Johnny Cash Remixed</em> is nothing quite so earth shattering or notable. It's more like a small, remote geyser through which a little bit of hell bubbles up into our world. Don't get me wrong: I don't consider Cash's persona or his music sacrosanct, so I have no reservations about any artist wildly re-imagining or remixing his songs. In fact, the Man in Black has become such a paragon of Americana ideals that a little pedestal wobbling could be more than welcome. We need a new way to look at Cash and his music, but <em>Remixed</em> isn't it. <br/><br/>These artists are engaging more closely with the myth than with the music, which means this project, dubious even at conception, becomes just another needless attempt to argue for Cash's relevance. Alabama 3 are the worst of the lot, continuing their streak of lame hick-hop gothicisms that started well before their overrated ""Sopranos"" theme. They rewrite ""Leave That Junk Alone"" as a startlingly obvious cautionary tale in which they play the junkies that saintly J.C. must counsel. Never mind that Cash was never so saintly, that his own battles with that junk were more complicated than a standard recovery narrative would suggest, or that such ambiguity was key to his lasting appeal and moral authority. Instead, Alabama 3 give an overly simple portrait of the man over tired beats, and it's not hard to imagine him rising from the grave to counsel them against creating such junk music. <br/><br/>Not simply unnecessary or misguided,<em> Johnny Cash Remixed</em> actively degrades Cash's legacy by showing how silly he sounds in such a determinedly modern context. And by ""modern"" I mean circa 1999. Midnight Juggernauts remix ""Port of Lonely Hearts"" with ethereal voices washing over the verses, and it <em>might</em> appeal to someone who still spins <em>Play</em> on a regular basis. At least it doesn't sound like Voodoo Child: Cash's ""Get Rhythm"" is so peripheral to the big beats of Philip Steir's remake that you could conceivably insert any song-- ""Umbrella"", ""Hey Ya!"", ""Yes We Have No Bananas""-- with no noticeable change. Hey, Philip! Get rhythm. Pete Rock's take on ""Folsom Prison Blues"" sounds inspired by Jon Spencer's risible remixes of R.L. Burnside, leaving Cash to sound like he singing from a stalled Ferris wheel rather than from a dank cell, and Sonny J remixes ""Country Boy"" to sound like ""Cotton Eye Joe"" by Rednex. Listening to it is like looking deep into the abyss and feeling only the coldness of cosmic solitude. You live alone, you die alone. ¬†<br/><br/>Obviously these aren't the most innovative artists anymore, which leaves you wondering what someone like Dan Deacon or Girl Talk or the Avalanches might do with this raw material. The biggest name here is Snoop Dogg, who actually gets a producer credit despite being on autopilot for the remix of ""I Walk the Line"" by QDT Music (DJ Quik, Dogg, and Teddy Riley). Says the rapper who recorded Doggy Style: ""Big Snoop Dogg. Johnny Cash. Remix. 'Walk the Line'. Yo, Johnny, talk to 'em for a minute."" Responds a sample of the guy who recorded <em>At Folsom Prison</em>: ""I keep a close watch on this heart of mine..."" It's an absolutely ludicrous moment in a relentlessly ludicrous song-- a parody of hero worship. But at least we'll get to see the pool this project helped pay for on the next season of <em>Fatherhood</em>. <br/><br/>So why doesn't this hell geyser get the full 0.0? Mainly for Count De Money's ""Big River"", which leaves that junk alone and subtly ratchets the Tennessee Two's rockabilly rhythm into a spry programmed beat. Despite retaining Cash's original vocal track, this remix says more about Luther Perkins and Marshall Grant than it does about Cash, specifically the way they were able to twist guitar and bass into an insistent, organic stomp. Not that you need this remix to point that out. Despite its redundancy, at least ""Big River"" has something interesting to say about Cash's music. That makes it an anomaly on an album that relies almost solely on received wisdom and perpetuates a tired hagiography that makes Cash seem less human with every year. The Cash boom is over. The Cash boom is over.</p></div>"|12589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12589-johnny-cash-remixed/|0.2|Stephen M. Deusner

Kuduro, which mixes rai and soca rhythms with local MCing and salvaged electronics, is the product of the same kind of environment and pressure that produced baile funk in Rio and kwaito in South Africa-- musics which make good touchpoints for kuduro's breakneck appeal. It was born in the Angolan capital Luanda and quickly jumped along post-colonial transmission lines to Lisbon, home of Buraka Som Sistema. The Buraka sound has been picked up by global tastemakers like Diplo and M.I.A., and debut album <em>Black Diamond</em> gives the crew an opportunity to show how kuduro works at fuller stretch-- and whether it can survive outside its specific locality.<br/><br/>Kuduro is a pun on Angola slang for ""hard ass""-- much of <em>Black Diamond</em> takes this as an operating principle. Buraka Som Sistema tracks often have the marvelous thickness of early jungle, that sense of pushing through electronic thickets, senses on hyper-alert. But their rhythmic template is more often the relentless bounce of soca. Soca's perpetual chirpiness makes it an acquired taste, but there's no denying its kinetic power, and blended with Buraka's harder beats and harsher sounds it becomes a fearsome engine for their music. The first few tracks are both introduction and pummeling workout-- the frantic M.I.A. team-up ""Sound of Kuduro"" sets the tone for highlights ""Aqui Para Voces"" and ""Kalemba (Wegue Wegue)"", which are less chaotic but even more exhilarating.<br/><br/>Opener ""Luanda/Lisboa"" starts with a keyboard throb that sounds like a generator powering up to the band can get enough juice to even play, and what's so attractive about the album is its constant flirtation with collapse-- everything's so furious, so quick-changing, so ramshackle that its tracks sound half-improvised. New riffs, bleeps and blurts constantly intrude, upsetting a tune's direction: the transitions between tracks are more like collisions. A song like ""IC19"" spends a while groping for a viable rhythm before rattling off on a chassis built from old school rave, dodging blasts of electro like oncoming traffic, before suddenly switching into the trancier, dirtier ""Tiroza"". Which in turn breaks down into what sounds like Portuguese folk music played on a crackly radio, a tune that becomes the digitally-tweaked basis for ""General""-- a song that halfway through bursts into a gloriously goofy ringtone melody.<br/><br/>""General"" is a good example of the group's more playful and atmospheric side, which emerges again when the tempo drops on the two-part ""New Africas"": their rumbling drum patterns show that the group's electro-world fusions survive a change in pace, but the somewhat mystical voiceover is an uneasy fit with the rest of the record's sharpness. Then again, not speaking Portuguese means I can't get the political references which are a big part of kuduro's Angolan appeal. As a sop to tourists like me, DJ Lil John has talked in interviews about how the band treat the voice as a percussive instrument, and it's an approach that works, with Kano's anglophone guest spot on ""Skank &amp; Move"" an unwelcome spell-breaker. But even if you don't have the language skills to get their full story, Buraka Som Sistema are worth your time: <em>Black Diamond</em> is one of the fiercest dance records in recent memory.</p></div>"|12577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12577-black-diamond/|7.9|Tom Ewing

Given the underground's long and relatively successful tradition of home-taping, self-releasing, and other sideways strategies for fanbase- and community-building, that's easily debated. You don't need to maintain a MySpace page (Boduf Songs doesn't) or do something like shake tambourines with Devendra and Joanna for an <em>Arthur</em> spread to participate in a larger cultural movement. In fact, the recipe that's nourished this one-man project over three LPs and several shorter recordings-- psych-tinged acoustic ramblings, spackle-thick atmosphere, and morbid lyrical preoccupations-- will be familiar to anyone who's spent time with the more apocalyptic segment of the robust indie-folk scene (see: Ben Chasny, David Thomas Broughton, and stylistic godfather David Tibet). Which is to say, a Boduf Songs record can be challenging, but is usually worth the effort.<br/><br/>Ironically, it's in support of his most accessible record to date, <em>How Shadows Chase the Balance</em>, that Sweet's work is being promoted as a sub-basement to the underground. Where previous long-player <em>Lion Devours the Sun</em> often winged off (successfully) on found-sound and noise tangents, <em>Shadows</em> hews to popular song conventions; a couple of tracks even tender soft, shuffling percussion. Most are unhurried affairs that seep in like warm bathwater on streams of static, droned feedback, electronic pulses and field recordings, fluttering and throbbing acoustic strings, and Sweet's own grave murmur. But if songs like ""Mission Creep"" and ""I Can't See a Thing in Here"" develop incrementally, once they get where they're going, they're effective and affecting, with sticky-sweet melodies and compelling textures.<br/><br/>This album's approachability, in fact, seems to come from Sweet's truce with sonic beauty. Boduf Songs provided glimpses of pretty in the past, but they were ephemeral as jellyfish, and just as menacing. Shadows' banjo-festooned tracks ""Things Not to Be Done on the Sabbath"" and ""Last Glimmer on a Hill at Dusk"", however, are night-blooming flowers that retain their glory past sunrise. The latter, with its swaying valedictory close, could slip unobtrusively onto a Sufjan Stevens tracklist-- as long as you disregard Sweet's Manichean outlook, that is. In Boduf Songs' brutal theology, darkness devours light, death defeats the living and nature and culture are at perpetual fisticuffs. The lyrical idiom is correspondingly pitiless: ""We fell to earth from pitch-black skies/ we feed upon the left behind"" (""Things Not to Be Done on the Sabbath""), ""We come to pick your bones/ Out of its eyes and through your skull"" (""I Can't See a Thing in Here""), or ""Lay down in the lamplight... tucked in on a bed of nails"" (""Last Glimmer on a Hill at Dusk""). <br/>¬†<br/>Perhaps the guy brings his day job at a Southampton university library home with him, because Boduf Songs is undoubtedly a textually dense, heavy tome to lift. That said, the music never becomes¬† inpenetrable, offputting or ""interesting"" but, alas, unlistenable. If it seems a strange critical tack to praise an independent musician by downplaying his underground credentials or off-road tendencies, it's only because I think music fans who might otherwise be put off by indier-than-thou rhetoric would actually really dig Boduf Songs.</p></div>"|12578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12578-how-shadows-chase-the-balance/|7.6|Amy Granzin

And given Moore's humble songwriting and performing style, one might easily assume that this could be the only headline he's ever interested in making. <br/><br/>So understated is <em>Stray Age</em>, in fact, that it is at least initially difficult to hear what exactly sparked Sub Pop's immediate enthusiasm, as there is nothing about this music that exactly explodes out of the speakers. Co-produced by Joe Chiccarelli-- whose extensive credits include work with U2, Beck, and the Shins-- the album is so hushed and intimate that most of it sounds like it could have been recorded with Moore seated in his favorite chair beneath the backyard oak tree. Technically, Moore's gentle, folk-based Americana is not miles apart from labelmates Iron and Wine or Fleet Foxes, but there is a straightforward simplicity to his work that immediately positions him at the most sonically conservative end of the Sub Pop spectrum. <br/><br/>As a vocalist, Moore can call to mind a less-mannered Will Oldham, or perhaps what Mark Lanegan might've sounded like several thousand cigarettes ago. On <em>Stray Age</em> Moore's plainspoken vocals are frequently accompanied by little more than a lone acoustic guitar or piano, placing an enormous burden directly on the songs themselves. This is always a risky strategy, as it virtually guarantees that a handful of the better songs here will outshine the rest, patching the album with several minor dips and lulls. (Of course, it doesn't help that there is nothing particularly distinctive or memorable about any of Moore's homespun lyrics.) On the album's best tracks Moore is able to display an unforced, instinctive grace, giving his songs the necessary space to move so they can eventually steal in like shadows, lodging themselves firmly in the rafters of memory. <br/>¬†<br/><em>Stray Age</em> does feature several cameo appearances from guest musicians, including Petra Haden on violin, Justin Meldal-Johnsen on upright bass, and Jesca Hoop on backing vocals. In these spare surroundings, each subtle addition can make a crucial difference, such as the lift Haden's violin provides midway through ""It's You"" to pull the gentle love song out of its tranquil slumbers, or the way Hoop's bracing harmonies help ""The Old Measure"" sound downright frisky. Elsewhere, however, Moore keeps his music stripped to the essentials, an approach that succeeds on the richly melodic ""By Dream"" or the introspective title track, but that eventually stalls the album's momentum before the (perhaps appropriately) narcotic closing track ""The Hour of Sleep"" wheels around.<br/><br/>In addition to Moore's ten original songs, the album also includes a cover of Sandy Denny's ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"", a track that serves as well as any to represent <em>Stray Age's</em> dreamy, wistful tenor. Well-rendered though this cover is, Moore does little to reinterpret or reinvent Denny's song to his own design, and in so doing illustrates a general disregard for innovation. Simply delivered and packaged, Stray Age requires a considerable amount of patience from its audience, and truth be told if it hadn't been for Sub Pop's patronage I probably wouldn't have given Moore as many chances as it took for even his best songs to sink in. Promising though <em>Stray Age </em>can be, next time hopefully Moore takes pains to make more headlines through his music itself.</p></div>"|12588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12588-stray-age/|5.7|Matthew Murphy

As Ohno leans back, wrinkled and seemingly near death himself, the flower in his hair sits in the same position as the bright blooms that hover above Darling.</p><p align=""justify"">But it's the differences between these shots that say the most about¬†<em>The Crying Light</em>. Much of what the Darling image represents-- gender identity, performance art, downtown New York circa Andy Warhol's Factory-- is reflected in¬†<em>I Am A Bird Now'</em>s stylistic range, as well as its use of guest artists who embody those subjects, like Lou Reed and Boy George. The symbolism of the Ohno picture is simpler. The dancer, cited by Hegarty as his role model for ""getting older as an artist,"" is now 102 and can no longer move or speak; he's been cast into a limbo between life and death. ""He really practiced his form until he couldn't move,"" Hegarty told¬†<em>The Wire¬†</em>magazine in December. ""And then he kept taking the right steps inside himself.""</p><p align=""justify"">On¬†<em>The Crying Light,¬†</em>Hegarty is fascinated with those steps-- the¬†transitions and overlaps between birth and life, life and death, this world and the next. ""From your skin I am born again,"" he sings in ""One Dove"", an ode to a bird from ""the other side"" that comes to ""bring me some peace."" Later, ""Aeon"" depicts eternity as a baby boy born to take care of his father, as time melts generations together. Similar concepts dot every song. With deft touch, Hegarty repeatedly uses words like ""womb,"" ""grave,"" and ""light,"" and he returns to primal metaphors-- water as life, dust as death, the earth as a place of both burial and growth. ""I'm only a child/ Born upon a grave,"" he insists in ""Kiss My Name"", nearly encapsulating the entire album in one potent declarative.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Though easier to summarize, these ideas are no less complex than those on¬†<em>I Am A Bird Now</em>. In fact, they're larger and more universal than that album's New York-tinted perspective. But they have also inspired Hegarty to craft simpler, subtler songs. Simultaneously sparse and rich,¬†<em>The Crying Light¬†</em>mines maximum intensity from¬†a relatively minimal mix of basic melodies, pithy lyrics, and understated arrangements.¬†It may be difficult to believe that an album crediting four arrangers and upwards of two dozen musicians could sound minimal. But the way Hegarty selects their contributions is more about precision than volume, more about carefully-chosen moments than multiple voices. Take the dark cello that closes ""Her Eyes Are Underneath the Ground"", the soft horn flourish in the middle of ""Epilepsy Is Dancing"", the fingersnap-like clicks at the end of ""The Crying Light"". These elements hint at fuller, busier versions of these songs. Maybe Hegarty did record more fleshed-out takes and then erased portions, letting their echoes float in the limbo that he sings about. Whatever his process, Hegarty's use of orchestration for accent and emphasis creates undeniable power, the kind that increased sonic density likely would have lacked.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Of course, lots of power also comes from Hegarty's voice. What's most impressive about his singing isn't its range-- though his octave-gliding trill remains spellbinding-- but the way he consistently picks the right tone at the right time. On ""Epilepsy Is Dancing"", his hum crests into a shivery warble just as the song veers into surreal imagery. He flips the trick on ""Daylight and the Sun,"" pulling back during the most plaintive lines (""Now I cry for daylight""), then purring fluidly through an unexpected epilogue. Most striking is ""Dust and Water,"" a droning meditiation in which his lullaby tones seem sung in a foreign language, despite the plain English found on the lyric sheet.</p>
<p align=""justify""><em>The Crying Light¬†</em>ends with ""Everglade"", one of the tracks Hegarty co-arranged with classical composer Nico Muhly. Filled with lilting flutes, rising strings, and operatic croon, it might be the most overtly dramatic track in the Johnsons' oeuvre, like a rescued score from some lost musical. ""When I'm peeping in a parlour of trees/ And the leaves are winking all around,"" he sings, ""'I'm home,"" my heart sobs in my veins."" That may read ultra-drippy, but on record it sounds decidedly profound-- a fully-earned approach to the precipice of the other world Hegarty has pondered for 40 fascinating minutes. In fact, the song's redemptive tone inspires similarly wild thoughts about the future. If Hegarty can craft an album this stunning about the path to paradise, just imagine how great the next one could sound, once he's actually there.</p></div>"|12596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12596-the-crying-light/|8.6|Marc Masters

A watery cocktail of cul de sac genres like downtempo, lounge, and ""world music"" (more on that in a second), the Washington D.C. duo's output has long worn its own inoffensiveness as a badge. If the fact that the press release for this album ledes with a quote touting them as ""quintessential ambassadors of the sophisticated global 'downbeat generation'"" doesn't put you on the scent of their relentless dedication to tastefulness, witness 2007's cover album, <em>Versions</em>, whose patently box-ticking tracklist included re-workings of songs by Sarah McLachlan, the Doors, and Astrud Gilberto. Eclectic!<br/>¬†<br/>Cover albums and mixes aside, <em>Radio Retaliation</em> is the pair's fifth studio album, and finds them once again failing to make anything but the most minute adjustments to the polite groove that is their stock, trade and-- in 2009-- monopoly. These guys have always been producers before songwriters, and, as such, their aesthetic reveals itself not through what they do, but rather, how they do it. Every broody atmosphere pad here is instructively reverbed, every rhythm perfectly loping, every whooshy sound effect painstakingly placed, every bluesy guitar curl appropriately perky, every edge sanded off, each fleck of grit, gristle and emotion dutifully rubbed out and dispensed with. With few exceptions, <em>Radio Retaliation</em> is both perfect and perfectly boring. Queen believed they were put on this earth to rock you; Thievery Corporation appear to have similar goals vis-√†-vis anaesthetizing you.<br/><br/>Now: the world music thing. At the very least, one might argue that the spate of travelogue-y lounge and downtempo mixes that lived in those chintzy cardboard cutout displays in major chain record stores around the late 90s and early 00s represented a necessary step forward in the legitimization and mainstreaming of non-Western music. This was before the full impact of the Internet and the MP3, don't forget; all music cost something, and any kind of musical curiosity still represented financial risk. In that climate, the slipstreaming of exotic sounds into mixes by reassuringly familiar DJs provided a degree of indemnity against that risk. So, even despite the fact that they almost always ended up diluting that which they were ostensibly championing, acts like Thievery Corporation provided a unique sort of utility.<br/><br/>In 2009, things are very different, and yet, suspended in amber as Thievery Corporation's sensibilities are, <em>Radio Retaliation</em>'s collaborations with Femi Kuti, Seu Jorge, and Anoushka Shankar still have the unfortunate effect of conjuring those weirdly uneven power dynamics. Kuti's track (""Vampires"") is easily the best thing here, but it doesn't compare, viscerally, to his own recordings. Meanwhile, Jorge and Shankar's contributions feel like they might as well have been recorded 10 years ago for some tokenistic, upmarket, double-disc dinner party compilation called <em>Global Soundz</em>. If you remember those records, and are perhaps embarrassed that they were even tangentially a part of your life, you might have a similar twinge of unease about hearing someone revive the template now. This is all, of course, in no way meant to suggest that Thievery Corporation are doing anything other than what sounds good to them; sometimes, though, tastefulness is its own worst enemy.</p></div>"|12602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12602-radio-retaliation/|2.6|Mark Pytlik

In the tradition of many post-hardcore bands, there are winding time signatures, grinding guitars, and strained, often obtuse lyrics-- ""Prince Squid"" starts with a theatrical bellow over fast and heavy drum rolls, ""He wants to be the big shot in your eyes/ But he's in FLUX MEMORANDUM."" You know, your typical boy-meets-girl confusion. But there's no reason to get down on TAAS for the trappings of their sub-genre (or for not picking a name that makes a catchier acronym). While they're continuing in a tradition, it's clear from <em>Tail Swallower &amp; Dove</em> that their ears have remained open.</p><p><em>Swallower</em> may feel familiar at first, but it's a record with many left turns. Some of them are more subtle than others. Opener ""Woolen Heirs"" starts out surging and swinging, with acrobatic guitar lines and punishing rhythms, but has a cool-down that includes faux-tribal chanting and some keyboard effects that'd be more at home on a Steve Miller record. And then there's repetition and patience in the closing minutes of near-epic ""Ethric Double"", marrying sparse, ominous jangle and a near-martial backbeat to a more traditional metal sound by the end. The second half of the record has the band stumbling and sputtering around foreboding electronic landscapes, growing more coldly mechanical with the end of ""Long and Lonely Step"" before the jagged lurch of ""Lead Beater"" and pitch-shifted vocals of ""Cavity Carousel"". The rhythm section bludgeons and swings with authority throughout all of it, with a surprising (and welcome) amount of the latter.</p><p>While the keyboards and chanting in ""Woolen Heirs"" might illicit a giggle and the 8-bit electric piano groove on ""Lucifer"" is a little close to late-career Blood Brothers for comfort, for all the band's stylistic wavering and kitchen-sink compositions, they usually seem to land squarely on their feet. There's a lot of balance on <em>Swallower</em>-- the songs are diverse without losing their taut and tortured center, and they even balance prog-rock indulgences with songs that prize catharsis and big riffs above all. But in that diversity, they never fully inhabit one mode or the other. These guys are capable of a lot more than you might first assume, and yet, it'd be interesting to hear what they could pull off if they focused in just one direction.</p></div>"|12585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12585-tail-swallower-dove/|6.4|Jason Crock

That record's premise-- Russell Mael overdubbing himself into a mock-operatic chorus and playing up his mock-operatic diction, his brother Ron supplying mock-dignified orchestrations and keyboards, songs built around amusingly banal phrases endlessly repeated--was also the basis for 2006's even better <em>Hello Young Lovers</em>. And it's returned for this record, whose theme, to whatever extent it has one, is the collision of dignity and indignity, hence Ron Mael being replaced on the front cover by a chimp in a tuxedo.</p><p>This time, though, the premise has worn thin. Virtually every song enunciates its central joke, then repeats it and repeats it and repeats it. And repeats it. And repeats it. And so on, with the repeating. (And repeating.) Very often, the title (""Let the Monkey Drive"", ""(She Got Me) Pregnant"") gives the whole thing away. Admittedly, ""Intro Reprise"" is a pretty good joke. So is ""I Can't Believe That You Would Fall For All the Crap in This Song"", by far the best song here because it's got actual dynamics and an actual groove: a smirky glam gallop underscored with a fabulous buzzing synth.</p><p>Still, they're almost all jokes first and foremost, and very shallow jokes. The best Sparks songs-- ""Angst in My Pants"", ""Dick Around"", ""Throw Her Away (And Get a New One)"", ""This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us""-- have almost always twined emotional cut-and-thrust with their boffo yocks. These don't, even when they have the opportunity to. ""Good Morning"", for instance, starts with the premise of waking up next to a gorgeous stranger, and never gets very far past it: ""It must have been the best line from me ever"" is potentially funny, but not exactly biting, and it's undercut by Russell's lookit-me-I'm-a-stuffed-shirt delivery.</p>
<p>""Strange Animal"", in fact, addresses the problem with the current state of the Maels' songwriting head-on: a stranger walks into a song, does a bit more fourth-wall-breaking tomfoolery, then apologizes for noting that ""the song lacks a heart, comes off overly smart/ An emotional core, ain't that what songs are for?"" A bit later, he complains that it doesn't have a specific goal: ""Entertainment or art, one should know from the start."" Either the Maels think those ends really are distinct, which given the last 35 years' worth of their career is mighty unlikely, or they're trying to make their character look churlish as a proleptic response to their audience. Both possibilities are vaguely insulting.</p>
<p>Even when the Maels' wit maintains a bit of its gleam, the incantatory, cod-classical mode in which they've entrenched themselves doesn't reliably work for them. ""Lighten Up, Morrissey"" is a great title, and a solid if lightweight lyrical conceit: ""If only Morrissey weren't so Morrisseyesque/ She might overlook all my flaws."" But it's so neo-Sparks-esque-- so stiff and mannered, so reliant on pounding in its catchphrase and central hook to the point of absurdity and beyond-- that it turns tedious. Loosen up, Sparks.</p></div>"|12575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12575-exotic-creatures-of-the-deep/|4.4|Douglas Wolk

The difference was that My Morning Jacket were actually pretty great, and like the best-kept secrets it wasn't long before more people discovered the group. Fast forward a decade and My Morning Jacket draw spillover crowds at Bonnaroo, celebrate themselves with live albums and concert films, headline a New Year's Eve show at Madison Square Garden, and enjoy life at the top supported by one of rock's most dedicated fan bases. It's all left the group with little to prove beyond its own further longevity. <br/><br/>Yet if their iffy 2008 album <em>Evil Urges</em> demonstrated anything, it's that, successful or not, Jim James and crew remain as restless as ever, and would rather do the wrong thing once in a while than do the right thing all the time-- especially if the right (read: predictable) thing threatens to turn to tedium. One result is that lame funk detours and other stylistic no-nos are now part of the band's permanent record, but hey, you win some and you lose some. Regardless, My Morning Jacket's live reputation remains undiminished. <br/><br/>But <em>Live From Las Vegas at the Palms</em> isn't another stage-bound victory lap in the mold of the epic <em>Okonokos</em>. Instead, it's an iTunes-exclusive stopgap (or, more generously, a gift to fans) by way of the state of the art studio housed in the Palms casino in Vegas. That means there's a) No distracting crowd noise, and b) Pristine sound, two things one rarely (if ever) expects from a live release. Whether those niggling details nullify the EP's ""live"" status is another matter; it's also largely irrelevant since what is here is a pleasant if decidedly low-key and minor session of mostly old material capturing the quieter-- and quiet storm-- side of the band. <br/><br/>The set leads with an infrequently performed early MMJ rarity, <em>The Tennessee Fire</em>-era ""Tonight I Want to Celebrate With You"", anchored by a reliably endearing Omnichord and a touch of spooky pedal steel before the rest of the band appears and (softly) fills in the empty spaces. The fine ""Dear Wife"", the only new song, would probably have fit comfortably on any of the band's last couple of records, but here it suits the almost cocktail lounge vibe of much of this EP. In this vein and in this context, ""Knot Comes Loose"", now replete with an instrumental outro, bests its not dissimilar counterpart on <em>Z</em>. It's looser and even lovelier. <br/><br/>From there the EP goes further back once again, to two more <em>Tennessee Fire</em> gems, ""From Nashville to Kentucky"" and ""They Ran"", each given essentially fresh studio makeovers, a little polish to get the decade-old DIY rust off. The former gains drums and a sax solo (!); the latter 1950s-styled harmonies that recall what Big Star was up to circa its ethereal masterpiece <em>Third/Sister Lovers</em>. By the time ""Thank You Too"" fades, it's clear James has made good on his promise ""to provide the listener with a sensual and deeply personal method for relaxational listening...to be enjoyed on a candle-lit bench, a secluded nook, or a sensuous dinner party.""<br/><br/>Well, partly. After the indulgences of <em>Evil Urges</em>, this is just the kind of palette cleanser both fans and fencesitters might appreciate. Yet each of these pretty trips down memory lane make you wish there were more where they came from. At a hair over 20 minutes, <em>Las Vegas at the Palms</em> fulfills the requirements of an EP-- it's short and sweet-- but it's also not entirely filling. If it was a sensuous dinner party James had in mind, then he must be a quick eater.</p></div>"|12601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12601-live-from-las-vegas-at-the-palms/|7.0|Joshua Klein

A lot of us were cultivating a longstanding relationship with Ed Lover and Dr. Dre (<em>Who's the Man </em>Dre, not <em>The Wash </em>Dre) and maybe have spent at least a half hour of the past decade wondering how K-Solo and/or Keith Murray keeps busy these days. As long as EPMD can draw breath, they'll likely be welcome on any number of nostalgia tours, but if <em>We Mean Business</em> is the first you've heard of<em> </em>the Long Island duo's latest iteration of grown-man business, you've got company-- the record didn't even land inside the Billboard 200. Still, <em>We Mean Business </em>is a surprisingly enjoyable reminder of the potency of a group often overshadowed by their more name-dropped contemporaries.</p><p>Needless to say, subject matter mostly boils down to EPMD being living legends and these young rapsters need to show them some goddamn respect. And really, <em>We Mean Business</em>' greatest achievement is how it manages to do such without Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith sounding bitter or out of touch-- pretty much impossible since the record is constructed as a self-contained 1990s simulacrum. Despite the presence of 9th Wonder (who could probably learn a thing from Erick Sermon about how to make a snare knock), these are the same sorts of beats you'd hear on a pre-millennium Def Squad project, right down to what feels like the 12th song they've done called ""Roc-Da-Spot"" (down to the same sample of Biggie's ""Unbelievable""). Usually, when beats are called ""round,"" it's on some edgeless backpacker shit, but Sermon knows how to play the back without turning into wallpaper, still spitting out tracks resembling Super Balls, dense, rubbery and altogether fun.¬†</p><p>The guests regularly outshine the hosts, but each has a variation on the sort of rugged, gruff flow that doesn't leave Erick or Parrish gasping. Redman shows to clown up ""Yo"", Raekwon and Method Man are still in great form on their respective drops, and Keith Murray answers the question raised earlier by indicating he's spent years trying to make sure ""wanksta"" and ""a homo shanked ya"" rhyme just right. Even the one notable contemporary feature comes from Skyzoo, the kind of guy who so far has made inroads only with the most virulent ""bring New York back"" crowd.¬†</p>
<p>Not much has changed about the group dynamic either-- while Parrish has the more technically impressive flow, E somehow gets the memorable lines, although it works in both ways. It's like his lisp has actually progressed with age (he boasts that he's the reason kids slow flow these days), but it can result in fully intelligible groaners like ""don't get me mad and make me Barack O-bomb-ya."" But whatever the two are going on about, for better or worse, it's as impenetrable as Company Flow for just about anyone under the age of 25: EPMD namedrops, amongst others, Dominique Dawes, W.C., Andre Rison, <em>Kung-Fu Hustle</em>, Mekhi Phifer, and then revives the stick-up kid catchphrase ""run your jewels"" as a hook with a typically cantankerous KRS-One.</p>
<p>Obviously, with such a low-risk, modest-reward format and almost non-existent commercial prospects, EPMD really had no chance of creating something that could knock <em>Strictly Business </em>out the box-- in large part because something like ""Yo"" will never get a video treatment in the manner ""Headbanger"" or ""Crossover"" did. Still, <em>We Mean Business</em> actually bears more in common with recent mixtape-style releases like Prodigy's <em>Return of the Mac </em>or Clipse's <em>Road to Til the Casket Drops </em>without reaching the musical heights of the former or the lyrical heights of the latter-- the breakdown of the usual promotion cycle to acknowledge the increasingly niche-targeted appeal of non-superstar rappers. I can't imagine EPMD meant for this to go beyond an already established fanbase of intensely dedicated listeners, but then again, ""the customer's always right""... well, that's just good business sense.</p></div>"|12591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12591-we-mean-business/|6.6|Ian Cohen

They're still pigeonholed in the same scene that lumps together artists as diverse as Boredoms and Guitar Wolf, yet no cottage industry of $30 imports or rock'n'roll zombie flicks buoys the Polysics like it does their contemporaries. Polysics always seems just <em>there</em>, recipients of piles of rote praise but forgotten mere months after each record</span>'<span>s release. <em>We Ate the Machine</em> continues the band</span>'<span>s run of solid releases but further paints them into a corner: Their frenetic synth-punk delights in defying conventional wisdom, but the noise junkies who might appreciate the group</span>'<span>s risk-taking might also find it difficult to take seriously their pop-punk bubblegum dalliances. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Similar problems dogged<em> </em>the Polysics' idols, Devo. Like their Japanese acolytes, the Akron crazies played to a sort of high-minded dysfunction, but the lasting image evoked by their sermon of de-evolution remains that of distant relatives dancing to ""Whip It"" at wedding receptions. So, as the looming beast of the 1980s threatened to leave Devo the eminently embarrassing duality of underground-sensation-slash-one-hit-wonder, they retreated further into the surreal technological fantasy of synthesizers. Polysics acknowledge their quirky identity in a similar fashion. In an act of Daft Punkian one-upmanship, the group named their record <em>We Ate the Machine</em> as a reaction to the common practice of claiming keyboards and laptops as members of a band. You can imagine an interview with Polysics going something like this: </span>""<span>Would you say you have you integrated electronic machinery into your sound?</span>""<span> </span>""<span>'Integrate' the machine? We fucking ATE the machine!</span>""</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Despite their machine-based diet, it seems Polysics have subsisted recently on a diet of heavy guitars. Their first proper full-length for MySpace Records sounds a little like what you might imagine a Polysics record would sound like on a MySpace record label: alien synthesizers running on rocket fuel and playing pinball with screamed hooks, but buttressed with the subtle backbone of hard rock and hardcore. The heaviness of the opening triptych, </span>""<span>Moog Is Love</span>""<span> to </span>""<span>Pretty Good</span>""<span> to </span>""<span>Rocket</span>"",<span> for example, owes less to napalm synthesizer freakouts than it does to dinosaur rock riffs. Older records like <em>Neu!</em> seemed concerned with stretching audacious drumbeats to their twitchy limits, the songs orbiting their own riffage but never allowing listeners to get too comfortable. Where once each musical idea, each guitar riff, each dissonant keyboard mash-and-grab segued into another wild and exciting experiment, <em>Machine</em> nudges ever further down the path of controlled chaos. As the record wears on, it returns to the major-key anime punk of previous records with head-bashing drum fills and four-alarm keyboards, but also tarries into further explorations like a mid-tempo disco-rock arpeggio on</span><span> </span>""<span>Colored Lizard</span>""<span>. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Of course, it</span>'<span>s arguable that the relative predictability of <em>Machine</em> negates the band</span>'<span>s charming destructive glee. But a group that revels in first sounding like Devo, then like Brainiac, then like guitar-effects wiz Agata from Melt-Banana, and then like the theme to ""Naruto"" might not deserve the criticism of diminishing individuality. <em>Machine</em> provides yet another close reading on the broad strokes Polysics paint out of their palette of pleasing (or, perhaps, displeasing) colors; the</span><span> resulting kaleidoscope feels more like a collage. Like Devo before them, the band once again comes off as studied and happy maniacs: the straight-A art school kids who grow up and teach at conservatories as opposed to the slackers who drop out and form the Velvet Underground. This perception makes it hard for Polysics to sell their anarchist shtick in the company of the dour, workmanlike aesthetes who supposedly constitute their peer group. The good thing is, Polysics don</span>'<span>t actually have any peers-- they ate them.</span></p></div>"|12568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12568-we-ate-the-machine/|6.9|Mike Orme

The Lone Star angle is essential in differentiating the band from the crowd of Appalachia-descended string bands who have sprung up in the Gourds' wake; the Hackensaw Boys, the Avett Brothers, and Chatham County Line play many of the same instruments, but toward regionally and musically different ends. The Gourds draw from the same well as Doug Sahm, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Bush, which makes them part bar-band rockers and part ensemble pickers. In their live shows, they dig their spurs into a song and open up its possibilities, whether it's a spirited original or an unlikely cover. Their stage presence is the key to their longevity, but their studio albums have become increasingly adventurous, with 2007's<em> Noble Creatures</em> and now <em>Haymaker!</em> gradually closing the gap between their recorded material and their performances. <br/><br/>The non-punctuation part of that album title refers to a knockout punch that floors your opponent. That might be overselling the album, but a dependable swing isn't far off. <em>Haymaker!</em> is a typically witty, rambunctious album that shuffles up the band members like a deck of cards. Three of the five Gourds sing lead, which gives each song a distinct personality without making it sound like a different band. Kevin ""Shinyribs"" Russell, besides having a great nickname, has perhaps the most recognizable voice here, lending a down-home quality to ""Country Love"" and ""The Way You Can Get"". Jimmy Smith sounds like Springsteen sitting in with the Sir Douglas Quintet on ""New Dues"" and ""Thurman"", although he can't redeem the awkward hook of ""Luddite Juice"". That leaves Max Johnston singing the modestly mournful ""Valentine"" and the closer ""Tighter"" and sounding about 20 or 30 years older than he actually is. If <em>Noble Creatures</em> made the Gourds sound like yokel Burroughses, writing lyrics so nonlinear they sounded like cut-ups, <em>Haymaker!</em> creates a more lucid slang that emphasizes backporch wordplay on the otherwise pedestrian rocker ""Country Gal"" and nearly anthropological details on the trucker anthem ""Shreveport"".<br/><br/>""Wake up! We're going to the country,"" Shinyribs sings on the energetic opener ""Country Love"", which ushers you into the Gourds' rural realm, where watching the stars together counts as a date and where a hook in the chorus is just as good as a hook in a fish. In fact, <em>Haymaker!</em> has a travelogue feel, which is perhaps inevitable for a hard-touring band. These songs traipse across northern Louisiana (""Shreveport"") to the Texas plains (""All the Way to Jericho"", namesake of the notoriously muddy Jericho Gap on Route 66) and points west (""Tex-Mex Mile""). They stop to pick up an idealistic hitchhiker in a tight Che t-shirt on the stand-out ""Bridgett"", on which Smith balances grinning wit and searing regret over Claude Bernard's rangey accordion. ""I bid adios to my camouflage rider,"" he sings wistfully. ""She said, 'Thanks for the lift, you old geezer.'"" That punchilne has some real sting to it, more potent for being so unexpected and more barbed for bursting his expectations. The Gourds' trip just gets longer and stranger.</p></div>"|12587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12587-haymaker/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

A series of high-profile shows in 1992 supporting the Cure on a world tour opened the gates to a wider audience, and their appeal began to stretch through to the goth community, especially to fans of the dreamier echelons (This Mortal Coil, Dead Can Dance). Since 1997, the group-- led by brother and sister Jim and Alison Shaw-- has taken intermittent breaks; the release of <em>Future Songs</em> in 2001 was followed by a live album, and then their most recent full-length, <em>Particles and Waves</em>, appeared in 2004.¬†</p><p>Cranes' last two albums signified a musical shift by extending their interest in glimmering electronic melodies and more gently contemplative song structures, eschewing the distortion-driven dissonance and upfront drumbeats of past recordings. Their self-titled ninth studio album continues this keyboard-focused pattern. Taken as a whole, the songs are stronger and more coherent than those on <em>Particles and Waves</em> and inhabit a more elusive and intriguing space. On tracks such as ""Feathers"" and ""Wires"", the guitar work remains delicate in tone, and slides with casual grace into the lovely pulse of the keyboard motif, creating a mysterious swirl of stripped-down beauty. Listening to it feels like walking into dark forest, finding an ancient music box buried under a pile of moss, and watching the ballerina inside pivot to an awkward interior clockwork. The metaphor is reinforced by the brilliant artwork featuring dandelion skeletons peeking through a dense midnight blue, lyrics about long walks and changing weather pressure, and the wintry landscape painting the recording.¬†</p><p>Alison Shaw's love-it-or-hate-it voice remains a constant presence in the band's ever-evolving sound, right down to the suitably thin, reverb-washed production. ""Unique"" doesn't do justice: She has a decidedly childlike cadence, and while some might argue that her vocals complemented Cranes' intense earlier sound better than the more recent material, her singing is the most definitive quality of the band and serves to give their music an edge. Without it, <em>Cranes</em> might veer toward the easy glide of the Sea and Cake discography and would verge on being a little too smooth and carefully trodden. On ""Move Along"", Shaw is at her best, as she breathes life into the sparse melancholy that ebbs and flows like the sea she describes.</p>
<p>While <em>Cranes</em> will not offer many surprises to longtime fans, its focus seems to be on the theme of searching for something, and it communicates this feeling with a persuasiveness that continues to build right through to the end. From the crystal-clear droplets of electronic glitches that form the delightful instrumental opening track, ""Diorama"", to the final song ""High and Low"", which comes to a close with the wistful mantra ""Where's the place between high and low?/ Maybe one day I'll know/ I've still got a long way to go"", one gets the feeling that Cranes are on a path that will keep them rising to the challenges they set for themselves.</p></div>"|12576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12576-cranes/|7.2|Mia Clarke

Not long after, a blogger at <em>The Guardian</em> made essentially the same claim. Weirdly, the conventional wisdom for those of us on this side of the Atlantic was just the opposite, the line being that 2008 was a relatively ho-hum time for American indie rock. My suggestion for UK indie: It's not us, it's you. In the past few years, it's too few art school bands, too few mavericks, and too few iconoclasts; it's far too many groups that amount to a haircut, a worn copy of <em>Is This It?</em>, and a provincial accent. Above all, it's far too many bands that confuse ambition with chart placements instead of creativity.</p><p>When Glasvegas first appeared a few years ago, they were trumpeted as an antidote to those problems and to bands like the Pigeon Detectives, the Enemy, and the View (don't worry-- you're not missing anything). They were a new template and a new set of influences (girl-group, JAMC and most any other band Alan McGee signed in the 1980s, Suicide, rockabilly). In short, a new hope. Their 2007 ""Daddy's Gone"" / ""Flowers &amp; Football Tops"" single quite rightly got plenty of people excited: Guitar pop with balanced levels of breadth and depth, hooks to spare, singer James Allan's thick Scottish brogue, and even lyrics that are ""about something"" (absent father and early death, respectively). Cue fanfare. And then, like so many other post-Oasis bands, Glasvegas somehow became swept into UK guitar-rock's ""go big or go home"" mentality; they hooked up with Muse and Mars Volta producer Rich Costey and have turned out an album that's more Kasabian than vintage Creation.</p><p>""Flowers"" and ""Daddy's"" survived: The former kicks off the record and is still the band's best song to date, although now it takes almost 90 seconds to get going before it inexplicably closes with 90 seconds of ""You Are My Sunshine"". The bloat can't touch the awfully great four minutes in between but it's a worrying metaphor for the rest of the album: Perhaps the band was unsatisfied with or unconfident in what it had, perhaps it is equating scopes and importance with droney add-ons or non sequiturs but ""Flowers"" served as a glorious epitaph on its own without the grabs at additional heft.</p>
<p>Another early song, former rockabilly-nicking ""I'm Gonna Get Stabbed"", has been renamed ""Stabbed"" and is now dominated by the melody to Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"". Most likely a reference to the Shangri-Las' awesome and heart-wrenching sexual abuse story ""Past, Present, and Future"", the addition of the classical piece here is awkward and cringe-worthy.</p>
<p>And the record sort of goes on like that: It's a frustrating listen, with almost every track containing both a hint of something awesome alongside a clunky distraction. (To be fair, fans of brash arena rock will likely overlook the missteps and find a lot to love here.) ""Daddy's Gone"" survives mostly intact, a tantalizing reminder that the pre-release huzzahs heaped upon Glasvegas were not just well-intended but well-founded. Should-be single ""Polmont on My Mind"" and welcome musical switch-up ""Ice Cream Van"" are worthy additions to the band's catalog. Newer singles ""Geraldine"" and ""It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry"" come close to matching ""Daddy's"", but are again weighed down by their own ambitions and clumsy lyrics-- particularly the latter which actually includes the lines ""liar, liar, pants on fire."" No, really: That's the future of UK guitar rock.</p>
<p>Here in America, we spent a lot of 2008, and now early 2009, celebrating a noise-pop underground that, in places, takes weak pop songs and slathers them with fuzz and reverb under the pretense of art. In this environment, it's great to see a band like Glasvegas go for it, take their own noise-pop impulses and shoot for the rafters. And yet, not only do they do it on almost every song, in almost the exact same way, but they seem to do just the opposite of the American brethren-- start with the fuzz and reverb, with quality noise-pop, then tack on layer after layer of gloss until their songs are transformed into modern rock. In their rush to be the UK's most important band, they seem to have ignored restraint, charisma, and charm-- the qualities that made them Next Big Thing candidates in the first place.</p></div>"|12597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12597-glasvegas/|6.0|Scott Plagenhoef

But with the ink still drying on last year's best-of lists, the recurrent genre's bright stars (Vivian Girls, Times New Viking, Crystal Stilts, Women) are already under attack, facing censure from both the anti-derivative, pro-virtuosity sects of the blogosphere and the types of ‚Äùfans‚Äù who hop trends every six months just to be the first to board and then jump a ship. Nodzzz, a smart aleck-y three-piece from San Francisco who share a few stylistic traits with more well-known noise-pop bands, will inevitably be lumped in with them and face similar (and probably misguided) backlash-driven criticism.</p>
<p>Despite a penchant for brevity (<i>Nodzzz</i>'s 10 songs clock in at under 16 minutes), a lo-fi aesthetic, and a tendency to brush their guitars and vocals with a light wash of fuzz, Nodzzz actually don't sound much like their contemporaries. Where other groups look to <i>Nuggets</i> and <i>Back From the Grave</i> for inspiration, these guys draw upon Stiff Records, pub rock, and the earliest British new wave of the 1970s-- Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello are accurate reference points. They also stir in an element of surfer-dude recklessness by means of their distinctive West Coast cadence. (Singer Anthony Atlas' vowel sounds are at times reminiscent of the Dead Milkmen goofing their way through ""Bitchin' Camaro"".) All of this-- plus, yeah, the signature jangle of their peers-- can be heard in the acoustic strums and ramshackle rhythms of opener ""Is She There"", which sets the record's low-rent, cold-beers-in-the-hot-sun vibe.</p>
<p>That spirit is another reason to not cast Nodzzz off as late-to-the-party scenesters: Like the Feelies or Modern Lovers before them, the group wears its quirkiness as a kind of badge of honor; it informs both its music and how they present it. On punchy, effortlessly catchy tracks such as ""I Can't Wait"" and ""Controlled Karaoke"", Nodzzz strike a tone of brazen, almost nerdy fun that's diametrically opposed to Crystal Stilts' poker-faced cool. But for all of the backyard partying, there's a sense here of impending severity. Sure, the band is living in a state of postponed adolescence, but they're also keenly aware of what's breathing down their necks. Much of the lyrical content of <i>Nodzzz</i> addresses this predicament-- the urgency of youth giving way to the inevitability of adulthood-- and the group commendably manages a lot with a little. (Remember, these songs rarely stretch past the two-minute mark.)</p>
<p>Openly sarcastic on ""Simple Song"", Nodzzz caution youngsters (and maybe themselves) against believing too much in their punk dreams. ""A time is gonna come when you're not young/ Hope you give up on that simple song/ Forget the words, be a mom,"" they advise. They get even more meditative on ""Highway Memorial Shrine"", pensively wondering how they'll ever ""go to San Francisco"" or ""get to a place [they] don't know."" Hmm...where do you go? Who do you need to know? Sound familiar? Yeah, it's the same set of brink-of-adulthood worries Morrissey posed in ""The Boy With the Thorn in His Side"" years ago. For a kid stepping into two-war, economic-collapse America, those questions are as pertinent (and unanswerable) now as they were then, and consciously or not, Nodzzz cleverly posit them here in stupid-simple terms to a new generation of misfits. That's a pretty slick move for a group supposedly riding the coattails of a trend bloggers claim is on its way out.</p></div>"|12598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12598-nodzzz/|7.6|Joe Colly

People who associate it with music at all are likely to think first of Count Basie or the American Jazz Museum and of course the immortal R&amp;B standard ""Kansas City"". But the city's musical history naturally extends well beyond that. As this 2xCD retrospective of the power pop label Titan illustrates, it even has a few lost chapters. There were garage bands and surf groups all over the Midwest in the 1960s and early 70s, and while most didn't last very long, their members often kept plugging away with new projects. Eventually, they left fertile ground to nurture a raft of punk and power pop bands, most of which were just as unsuccessful as their garage-bound predecessors.</p><p>If you're going to be unsuccessful, though, you might as well be spectacularly unsuccessful. The Titan label's first transaction was to bounce a check, and things didn't get a whole lot better after that. Tom Sorrells and Mark Prellberg were music nuts who originally planned to start a <em>Who Put the Bomp</em>-style zine to focus on the stories of forgotten-in-their-own-time garage bands of the Great Plains and underecognized current acts, but an introduction to Gary Charlson changed that. After having ""Real Life Saver"" sung to him over the phone, Prellberg made the executive decision to divert the zine's start-up funds to recording the song and another Charlson composition and press it up on 45, complete with a sweet picture sleeve featuring an unauthorized image of a Wintergreen Life Saver.</p><p>There was no need to worry about getting into legal trouble for trademark infringement, though, because neither Prellberg nor Sorrells had any connections, and the single barely cleared a few mile radius around Kansas City on its release. Not for lack of quality, though-- ""Real Life Saver"" is a genuine power pop treat. Charlson's great doubled falsetto is ably abetted by a sharp arrangement and good drumming. Charlson has seven tracks on this comp, and he was a great tunesmith, not to mention a good interpreter. His version of the obscure Dwight Twilley gem ""Shark"" is a fantastic rock'n'roll raver. Charlson recorded a live album of covers for Titan, a record that languished too long and sent him off to Bomp! To get it released. Titan responded by rush-releasing it first, destroying the label's relationship with its founding act.</p>
<p>I have to call Charlson the founding act and not the first signing because Titan didn't do contracts. It was a business with no business plan or budget, a series of un-recouped investments made on the basis of handshakes. They lost perhaps their best band, the Secrets* (the meaning of the asterisk is apparently secret), in a similar situation when they adopted new management and left to seek a major label deal, taking some Titan-funded recordings with them. The Secrets* are responsible for several of this set's highlights. The ebulliently bitter girl-destroys-boy stomper ""It's Your Heart Tonight"" would've fit great on the radio next to Cheap Trick, if anyone had ever played it on the radio, while ""Radio Heart"" starts with a melodic bass solo, then delivers a mission statement of sorts with its opening line: ""I just wanna blast out your favorite tunes.""</p>
<p>Sorrells and Prellberg looked outside of K.C. for talent as well, recording but not releasing a single by Lawrence, Kan., band Millionaire at Midnight, and reaching up into Lincoln, Neb., to pluck the city's resident Anglophiles the Boys. The Boys were the highest-profile act ever to give Titan the time of day, having opened stadiums for Blue √ñyster Cult, ZZ Top, and REO Speedwagon. They had everything going for them except timing-- the kinds of wonderfully snaking melodies and big vocal harmonies they pedaled may have gotten them somewhere in the 60s or even the halcyon days of indie pop a decade later, but in 1979 they fell on deaf ears, This despite the fact that their cheekily titled ""(Baby) It's You"", which is not a Bacharach/David cover, was Titan's best seller by far.</p>
<p>I was skeptical when I first started listening that this set truly merited two discs, but I was pleasantly surprised to get through both of them wanting more. The discs aren't numbered, but are simply labeled ""Fave Side"" and ""Rave Side,"" and both are stuffed with faves and raves alike. The Numero guys included a bunch of worthy unreleased material from the label's 1978-1981 run, such as ""The Water"", by Bobby Sky, whose time in L.A. with Kim Fowley is evident in the Beach Boys-ish vocal melody, bright piano interjections, and layered chorus harmonies. Scott McCarl's ""I Think About You"" popped up on a CD released by Sorrells in the mid 90s, but it dates from 1981, and it's an outstanding slice of bounding indie pop that deserved inclusion.</p>
<p>Titan ultimately deserves the resurrection it gets here. Limited resources and even more limited business acumen may have prevented the imprint from ever snatching its pie out of the sky, but Sorrells and Prellberg were fans before they were ever label men, and you can tell they picked these bands to record because they loved the music. The recordings are professional, and the musicianship is mostly outstanding-- see Charlson's dual lead on ""Brown Eyes"" or the weird but effective drumming on J.P. McClain &amp; the Intruders' ""Just Another Pop Song"" for examples. But beyond that, good guitar pop is good guitar pop, and most of these tunes are easy to connect with 30 years after the fact.</p></div>"|12566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12566-titan-its-all-pop/|8.0|Joe Tangari

Haile Selassie, former Emperor of Ethiopia, is of course the figurehead of Rastafarianism, and Ethiopia the religion's fabled Zion. The symbolic red, green, and gold colors of the Ethiopian flag pervade Jamaican iconography, while Jamaican folk hero, activist, and reggae mainstay Marcus Garvey advocated a return to Africa. And of course the two nations will be linked forever through reggae, still the musical <em>lingua franca</em> across much of the globe but especially throughout Africa. <br/><br/>Yet while reggae is steeped in African and specifically Ethiopian imagery, with the Ethiopian Amharic dialect even cropping up in several classic songs, the number of prominent collisions and collaborations of Ethiopian and Jamaican musicians remains rather limited. You'd think someone would have thought to fuse Ethiopia's rich musical heritage with reggae by now, but apparently reggae's long-distance love of Zion has been enough. <br/><br/>British producer and Transglobal Underground vet Nick Page, aka Dub Colossus, got the ball bouncing with <em>A Town Called Addis</em>, an intriguing conflation of reggae and dub sensibilities with Ethiopian pop. It's an ingenious idea made more interesting by its roundabout mode of composition. First, Page traveled to Addis Ababa, where he began work on the album in a hut, the sessions frequently interrupted by children playing, dogs barking and the like. Next, Page took the tapes back to England, inviting a handful of Ethiopian players along with him to put the finishing touches on the disc.<br/><br/>It's the second factor that makes <em>A Town Called Addis</em> so appealing. On top of Page's various riddims are a host of imported X-factors, from Ethiopian singer Sintayehu ""Mimi"" Zenebe to Teremag Weretow, who plays a one-stringed fiddle known as a messenqo. With the sessions rounded out by a handful of other Ethiopian musicians of varied backgrounds and prominence, from prestigious saxophonists to relatively unknown pianists, the project all but completes itself. A + B = C. <br/><br/>Granted, that undersells Page's dub instincts, and in fact <em>A Town Called Addis</em> would have been perfectly listenable free from its Ethiopian components. Yet the more ear-catching elements of ""Entoto Dub"", such as its jazz-infused horns or exotic plucked strings, would have been sorely missed, as would have been the impassioned vocals enlivening the spacey ""Tazeb Kush"" or the smartly interwoven performances that bring ""Yeka Sub City Rockers"", ""Tizita Dub"", the wobbly and woozy ""Sima Edy"" and ""Ophir Dub"" into vibrant 3-D. The thrilling horns and piano on ""Mercato Music"" alone even overshadow the otherwise overwhelming dub factor (by design-- it's a Dub Colossus disc, not a Ethiopiques comp). <br/><br/>It's the kind of culture clash that used to sneak out of dub-crazy Brit Adrian Sherwood's studio all the time back when that producer was working at his prolific peak, rich and exciting without ever feeling like a bland busman's holiday. From Jamaica to England to Ethiopia and back, you can hear the give and take between the different cultures, united through music and a desire to create something new out of traditions so old.</p></div>"|12582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12582-a-town-called-addis/|7.6|Joshua Klein

Ambassadors of the Four Elements, the duo takes a luddite attitude toward both the ringtone-ready aesthetic of Southern rap and the nervous textures of the Anticon crowd: They are dyed-in-the-wool crate diggers, mavens of the analog who know how to grip mikes and govern crowds and work the stylus.<br/><br/>Over the course of five albums and numerous live shows, P.U.T.S. have come to embody the carefree, community-driven dream of early hip-hop, chiefly by dropping macho self-seriousness for a Saturday-afternoon ease and brightness of mood. (It's tempting to connect this attitude to their move, before their debut album, from Los Angeles to the cushier San Francisco.) Glazed with funk and jazz samples, their smartly sunlit throwback sound allied them with like-minded acts such as Pharcyde and tour partners De La Soul.<br/><br/>On their latest record, <em>Fun DMC</em>, P.U.T.S. happily exalt the mundane, turning the everyday material of urban existence into tunes suggesting that life ought to be lived as an eternal weekend. ""We wanted to get the ambience of the dudes playing dominoes, the meat sizzling on the grill, the planes flying by,"" claim the duo on their website. ""We just said, 'Let's try to get what our Saturday is like onto a record. Instead of making a record about Saturday, let's actually go out and record Saturday.'"" In a marketplace that still puts a premium on rap sheets-- gangster chic's self-fulfilling prophecy-- it poses a commercial risk merely to chronicle your neighborhood get-togethers. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, instead of detailing the tragedy of their rough-and-tumble upbringing, the rappers show us how they skipped past it. ""Gamin' on Ya"" describes one charmingly dorky route out of the tough L.A. life, as the duo reminisces about their high-school quest to get high scores, not to get high. Video games aptly grace both the foreground and the back, which feels glued together from arcade-game found sounds and Nintendo 8-bit blips. We find another nonviolent ritual in ""Anotha' (BBQ)""-- the joy of the cookout, itemized over handclaps and a loop of sighing disco guitars. The importance of friends (""D"") and family (""A Baby"", ""Suite for Peter Pt. 2"") wins out on this record, and an appropriately soothing ambience, free of bravado and menace and anomie, sweeps over the whole tracklist. Feel-good beats for feel-good reflections.<br/><br/>Any MC worth his kicks has to publicly feel good about his hometown, too. Hence ""California"", a sequel in spirit to Dr. Dre and Tupac's ""California Love"", which lives on here through the revival of its West Coast poplockin', famously vocoded Roger Troutman chorus. (Listen for a Pharcyde sample, too, among dozens of others.) P.U.T.S. love their state too much to watch it crumple in the face of vials and handguns. They don't ask for much. In ""Anotha' (BBQ)"" the rapper is simply glad he has never been shot. The theme of needless bloodshed recurs in ""D"", a heartfelt eulogy to a friend lost to the bullet, and in ""Critical Condition"", which expresses sadness about the absurdity-- and stubborn persistence-- of inner-city warfare. The duo sees this all as a kind of slow-motion suicide.<br/><br/>Behind all the summery sounds and sentiments, <em>Fun DMC</em> is not just a lament, but an argument. It is a battle of logic that California hip-hop has been conducting with itself, one that has been more philosophically central to rap than any other genres: Do you represent the hard truth of the street code or do you represent its rejection? This record chooses life. It chooses video games and comic books (if you buy the CD) and barbecues and family, growing up without getting old. To be sure, in terms of sound and production style, since 2006's <em>Stepfather</em>, P.U.T.S. have been returning to their roots: the smoky funk grooves, the boom-bap delivery, the patchwork of samples. But they also confront deeper matters, and sleekly weave them into their classic good-vibe atmosphere, offering listeners a new level of profundity, energy, and intricacy without surrendering the sheer pleasure they expect from a People Under the Stairs record.</p></div>"|12565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12565-fun-dmc/|7.6|Roque Strew

I don't mean that flippantly or pejoratively, but I just can't think of a more appropriate term. Here we have a producer who sealed his rep as a dubstep powerhouse with 2008's much-buzzed-about breakthrough single ""Mu5h/Spliff Dub (Rustie Remix)"", and then he goes and decides that the best way to build on that goodwill is with a full-length 'ardkore/jungle throwback album. Well played, sir, and bonus points for turning a half-rhetorical phrase from M.I.A.'s ""XR2"" into a giddy, time-warping answer: <em>Where Were U in </em>'<em>92? </em>isn't just a rib-nudging throwback, but an electronic dance music family tree's branch rendered in flashing neon. Despite his dubstep associations, Zomby is revealing himself to be a provocative genre-tweaker, someone who's never content to let an idea stagnate for more than a moment and shoots out in all directions-- historically and stylistically-- to keep things interesting. As one of those crucial producers who can trace his current musical lineage back through a youth consumed by garage, jungle, and rave, he's long since figured out how all the pieces fit together.</p><p>This album's circa-1992 throwback elements are obvious but cleverly deployed: Bursts of ultra-pitched-up diva vocals provide hyperactive melody, only to be answered by rugged dancehall shouts; sirens and air-horns explode against densely-packed uptempo breakbeat rhythms; synthesized stabs and slashes blur the line between pianos and string sections. And while the album feels brief yet fully realized, its mood-swing structure and abrupt transitions-- the wobbly, dubbed-out gloom of ""Tears in the Rain"" jolted into the shiny 1 a.m. massiveness of ""Get Sorted"", or the rapid-fire ""Hench"" stepping into the subdued breakbeat of ""B With Me""-- evoke the kind of feverish real-time mutation that came from a low-tech, pre-internet yet fast-moving DIY movement. It all sounds a bit like a homemade mix cassette assembled from scraps and pieces by some teenager with a dual-deck tape recorder and more interest in pace-tweaking, blunt-trauma segues than seamlessly-crossfaded transitions. (Though you can't say he didn't warn you, what with the first track bearing the title ""Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance"".)</p><p>Zomby's commitment to the era's style extends all the way to the equipment he used to record the album, using the studio techniques of the era and putting it all together on an AKAI S2000 and an old version of Cubase running on an Atari ST. So it's kind of jarring-- in a good way-- to hear a few more current-day notions run through it, like some of the robot vocals from ""Technologic"" downpitched and dragged across an archetypal breakbeat rhythm on ""Daft Punk Rave"", or the crunked-up ghettotech of ""Pillz"" making the UK hardcore/Southern bounce connection (and its shared interest in ecstasy) that much clearer. And there's never a sense that the music on here is strictly a backward glance; for every moment that sounds like it could've come from A Guy Called Gerald's <em>28 Gun Bad Boy </em>or one of those great early jungle tracks that came out on Awesome Records or Moving Shadow back in the day, there's enough guttural bass and rhythmic elasticity to remind you of the garage and dubstep disciplines where breakbeat's successors eventually migrated to by the mid-late 00s.</p>
<p>It only makes sense that this album closes out with ""U Are My Fantasy (Street Fighter II Theme Remix)"", which reworks Baby D's '92 rave anthem ""Let Me Be Your Fantasy"" with music and sound effects from the classic fighting game, since <em>Super Street Fighter II Turbo </em>was recently revived as an updated, modernized, super-glossy high-definition remake for next-gen home consoles. And just as the people who grew up throwing dragon punches in arcades found out that there's still a tight, fluid game under that shiny new surface, Zomby's proven that the fundamentals of a sound that peaked over 15 years ago can still be streamlined into the current zeitgeist. He's gotten to the point where he can invoke old signifiers as something more than you-had-to-be-there nostalgia: all at once, <em>Where Were U in </em>'<em>92? </em>is a history lesson, a depiction of a musical timeline that folds in on itself, and a revival that works because it approaches its subject with the idea that it simply evolved instead of died.</p></div>"|12543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12543-where-were-u-in-92/|8.3|Nate Patrin

Sharing the tech savoir-faire of bands like Metronomy, Apes &amp; Androids, and Shitdisco, the English four-piece's debut <em>Fantasy Black Channel </em>strives to compress the 1980s into a dozen MP3s, unzipping hedonistic nostalgia for a generation of consumers entranced by the pop styles immediately preceding their birth. Obviously they're not alone in their exploitation of that decade, but with 2007 single ""Bathroom Gurgle"", a sprawling smorgasbord of 80s electro pop and soul, the band showed potential to actually deliver on the retro promise.<br/><br/>Assigned to bottle this lightning, Erol Alkan does his usual shtick behind the boards, blasting everything into the red until it sounds like a sci-fi cartoon theme. Criticized for his de-humanizing touch on the Long Blondes' bleak <em>""Couples""</em>, here Alkan's cyborg sensibilities feel more fitting. After all, this is hardly verse-chorus-verse Britpop or post-punk he's playing Frankenstein with-- LOTP thrive on labyrinthine song structures and stylistic misdirection, in case ""Gurgle"" didn't make that obvious enough already.<br/><br/>In fact, the whole album plays out like an 80s medley curated by the Human League, Prince, and <em>1984</em>-era Van Halen. After a minute-long opener, it's a free-for-all: David Bowie-inspired space operas like ""Broken"" or ""VW"" butt up against relatively conventional dancefloor favs like ""The Bears are Coming"" and ""Focker""; the only common elements between them are Alkan's piercing synths and frontman Samuel Eastgate's loose lyrical themes involving existential dread, hedonism, and a fixation on animals and nature. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, some instances of supposed chaos feel rote, following the ""Gurgle"" blueprint a bit too closely and shoehorning an obligatory dance breakdown between disparate sections. Eastgate's lyrics, while delivered well, often aren't doing anyone any favors either, pining over techno-paranoia clich√©s or vague, half-hatched poetry. There are attempts at a more refined pop craft, like the twitchy XTC-inspired ""The Enemy Are the Future"", but even that track ultimately succumbs to a hi-hat outro, leaving the most memorable vocals hooks as the ones that are the least intelligible and human.<br/><br/>Considering how this band's buzz originated from a quirky electro single in the vein of ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun"", <em>Fantasy Black Channel</em>'s unevenness shouldn't be that surprising, but the flaws are troublesome. At its best moments, the debut sounds like an A.V. club president's wet dream, unabashedly nerdy and technically proficient. Sadly though, the record is peppered with aesthetically dubious nu-rave moments, making LOTP sound less like sympathetic revenging nerds and more like party-crazed dude-bros who just happen to own synths.¬†</p></div>"|12555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12555-fantasy-black-channel/|6.7|Adam Moerder

Judging from the title of <em>Emeritus</em>, this time, he actually means business. But really, the main difference it has from its predecessors is that it could just as easily be titled <em>Scarface Presents: Look Back in Anger.</em> It's a record that settles scores, names names, and, after a career spent on exploring the moral complexity of the gangsta lifestyle, finally hands down something resembling judgment.¬†</p><p>Of course, it's presented within the framework of typical Scarface themes. Paid dues are acknowledged, realness is recognized, punks get dealt with accordingly, and the only thing he takes lying down is his next fuck. In fact, the first seven minutes of <em>Emeritus </em>are spent with almost petty focus, updating you on what Lil' Troy has been up to since ""Wanna Be a Baller""-- namely, talking to police and fucking up the money of Houston's realest. But the state of hip-hop is the least of Scarface's problems on <em>Emeritus</em>, as it's defined by an unrelentingly bleak outlook on just about everything. After Barack Obama's win in November, <em>The Onion </em>published an article entitled ""Black Man Given Nation's Worst Job"". The last verse on ""Can't Get Right"" becomes an extension of that, as Scarface explains that he didn't vote for Barack because he ""loves him."" Elsewhere, he sees so little worth living for in this world that, despite his deep religious beliefs, he'd rather his baby's mother have an abortion than to see another child suffer through a system that sets him up for for failure. ""We ain't first class citizens/ And we ain't second either."" Rap's coke kingpins have nothing on Pfizer and even the meanest block isn't as dangerous a place for a young black man as an army base.¬†</p><p>Even physical pleasures are mostly done away with. ""Who Are They"" works with the same ""everyone loves you when you're rich and famous"" concept as Mike Jones' ""Back Then"", but entirely guts it of innocent charm and instead becomes an ugly airing of grudges that have become positively poisonous over the span of decades. Along with K-Rino and Slim Thug, Scarface takes a nearly ascetic tone, seeing strip clubs and the old neighborhood as places to revel in the failures of others as much as reminders of their own success. As such, it makes the sex jam ""High Note"" something of a rare misstep.</p>
<p>And yet, that <em>Emeritus </em>often seems more righteous than cynical or hopeless (the latter two are a bit soft) is a testament to Scarface strengthening his flow in age. He always sounded old before his time, but now, as he approaches 40, it's like his time has come. Mortality hangs heavy over <em>Emeritus</em>. Scarface laments ""Analyzing all the wrong I've done/ I'm surprised I ain't dead/ I guess the good die young"" while numbed by the frequency of funerals he's attending. As far as production, he rhymes over beats that might be a bit more lush and modern than Rap-A-Lot's known for (though the buzzing sawtooths of ""High Powered"" bring to mind Swizz Beatz' production on Noreaga's ""Nahmeanuheard""), but it's a good look this time out. Don't forget that Scarface was something of an honorary member of Roc-A-Fella's roster during the two-year bubble before and after <em>The Blueprint</em>.</p>
<p><em>Emeritus </em>is almost entirely bullshit free. No words wasted and outside a bit of we-the-best chest puffing with Lil Wayne (""call me by my new name... 'Featuring Lil' Wayne'"") and Bun B (""we keep it crunk like Obama in Invesco"") on the unrealistically titled ""Forgot About Me"". Nearly every track makes its point and moves forward, although there's plenty of seemingly redundant and occasionally trite code of the street moralizing. Still, if anyone deserves a victory lap, it's Scarface. And yet <em>Emeritus </em>is every bit in the right doing what feels like the complete opposite-- manifesting Bobby Knight's famous request that he be buried face down so all his detractors could kiss his ass.</p></div>"|12537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12537-emeritus/|8.0|Ian Cohen

Their most passionate followers, after all, aren't known for their enthusiasm about effete things like melody and guitars. And that is understandable. This is a band that has ""cooked mud, transformed meat to percussion, and recorded 20,000-volt transformer stations,"" that has derived its iconoclastic reputation from its long refusal of modern music's comforts and institutions. Cleverly parting with the music-industrial complex, <em>Jewels </em>culls from the third phase of a Supporter Project, where fans funded the production of their previous record, <em>Alles Wieder Offen</em>, in return for a song a month.</p><p>First, the band left things to chance, having each member pluck a card from a deck, √† la Brian Eno's ""Oblique Strategies,"" to determine what their role in each song would be. Each card displayed a ""cryptic reference"" to some moment or passage or mood that appears in the Neubauten discography. Effectively, this ""subversive interpretation game"" narrowed the aesthetic range, ensuring a welcome continuity by rooting¬†<em>Jewels</em>¬†in past releases-- the liberties taken<em> </em>here<em> </em><em> </em>might remind fans of <em>Halber Mensch</em> or the more recent, assaultive Musterhaus series of CDs. Most challenging, and arguably the most rewarding, are a jerky dive into water (""Mei Ro""), a sandwich of whispers and spaceship ambiance (""I Kissed Glenn Gould""), and a buzzsaw's conversation with a robot (""Vicki"").</p><p>Newcomers may be happy to hear that eccentricity and harshness on that scale isn't sustained across <em>Jewels</em>. This is plain from the first track, ""Ich Komme Davon"". Hints of melody we found in <em>Silence Is Sexy</em> and <em>Perpetuum Mobile</em> abound here, too, on the opener and the sleekly electronic ""Ansonsten Dostojevsky"". Even the band's growing sensitivity to space and rhythm, last seen in <em>Grundst√ºck</em>, the second installment in the Supporter Project, surfaces on the record's strongest track. At six and a half minutes, ""Die Ebenen werden nicht vermischt"" stands out as epically proportioned, a mash-up of Gregorioid chant and musique concr√®te that calls to mind an oil derrick toppling into a monastery.</p>
<p>For a band that serves as an intermediary stop between trippy Krautrock outfits like Faust and Can on one hand, and bruising sonic nihilists like Test Dept. on the other, Neubauten has eluded pat labels. To be sure, they led the way with industrial music, effectively approaching Home Depot as Guitar Center, but their sound is obviously much more than power-tool improv, and far too varied to stay within one genre, as listeners discover here. Not every song on <em>Jewels </em>is a triumph. But each is a gift, literally, to devotees old and new. Not only a token of appreciation but a reminder that Einst√ºrzende Neubauten's 28-year career leaps from Howitzer storms of noise to anxious, multiform expanses without sacrificing a whit of their questing, avant-garde intelligence.</p></div>"|12552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12552-jewels/|7.6|Roque Strew

A synth wobbles. A bass drum rumbles. A voice (or sample of a voice) warbles along. A reverb-drenched guitar arpeggio vies with a fuzzy bass to give the track direction, which singer Jonathan Visger refuses to provide with his yelpy and uneasy vocal melody. ""Fog"", the first song on the album, is stately and more subdued, less amorphous. The drums plod at an uncommitted trot, the guitars occasionally lock into something more forceful. The elusive vocals and airy keyboards meet somewhere in the ether, mysterious and majestic yet modest all the same.</p><p>These tracks are striking and spooky bookends to a disc that swings both ways. One moment it plays it safe with the relatively straight indie rock of ""Point A to Point B"" or the fitfully funky ""Only a Moment"", and then it becomes loose and abstract on ""In the Mirror"" or the consciously unbalanced ""Downpour"" (sort of indie-rock screwed and chopped). Surely the all-encompassing shadow of Radiohead falls on this record, but it's equally reminiscent of the hazy art-rock of TV on the Radio (with whom ""Olly Oxen Free"" shares producer/engineer Chris Coady). Certainly a track like ""Alone"" makes the band sound like it's dined a few times at the Cookie Mountain Buffet.</p><p>Of course, the Ypsilanti, Mich., group isn't a match for those aforementioned acts, at least not yet, but they do demonstrate a similar ability to make weirdness seem normal, and normal seem weird. Witness ""In the Mirror"", which begins mournful but slowly evolves into something uneasier, or ""Out Dragging the River"", a simple slow-jam that gradually but only very subtly ups the energy of the skeletal arrangement, like clouds gently parting to reveal the sun peeking out.</p>
<p>Compared to songs such as these, the propulsive ""Shiny"" and the angular ""Only a Moment"" at first seem conspicuously conventional, but even these tracks go some strange places that save them from a more mundane fate. Yet one of the strengths of the disc is that its many eccentricities don't come off as cloying, look-at-me affectations. Rather, both band and album alike seem genuinely interested in keeping the sonic see-saw teetering, never fully touching ground at either end, preferring to straddle the constantly unsteady fulcrum in between.</p></div>"|12530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12530-olly-oxen-free/|6.9|Joshua Klein

During the band's long run from 1962 through 1996, the Davies brothers and their abettors never morphed into a nostalgia act, continually changing and writing new material to create a varied but distinctive body of work. The variation isn't only stylistic, either-- their catalog varies a lot in quality as well. The Kinks' work from 1966 through 1970 is basically unimpeachable, but opinions differ widely on what came after, and for good reason. So in constructing a six-disc look at the band's vast catalog, the challenge becomes to adequately represent each of the its phases while balancing considerations of what's actually worthwhile.</p><p><em>Picture Book</em> answers this challenge through a capricious, sometimes puzzling track selection, which was assisted by Ray Davies. It's a (mostly) chronological jumble of singles, album tracks, alternate mixes, mono versions, live cuts, rarities, hits, misses, and even a couple demos and one rehearsal. Two-thirds of the material is familiar album and single tracks, though, meaning that hardcore fans hoping for a bonanza will ultimately find about two discs worth of stuff they don't have or previously found difficult to get, some of which are hard-to-distinguish mono mixes. Then there's the matter of who actually wants a box that covers the band's whole career but leaves out tons of the band's best tracks and has a sixth disc that's mostly awful.</p><p>The set starts with BBC announcer Brian Matthew introducing the band before ""You Really Got Me"" rips into rock'n'roll and takes out a lasting bite with its brutal slashed-amp distortion and stupid-simple riff. The 1964 song put the band firmly on the map-- it was a UK #1 and a Top Ten hit in the U.S.-- but it was actually their third single. Here, it's followed a few tracks later by their first, a cover of ""Long Tall Sally"" that justifiably went nowhere. Omitted is their second single, the superb and infectiously melodic flop ""You Still Want Me"", which was thankfully included on Essential's 1998 remaster of the band's self-titled debut.</p>
<p>The period from 1964 through 1971 covers the first three discs and spills onto the fourth, which is as good an assessment as any of the band's best and most creative period. The run of albums from 1966's <em>Face to Face</em> through <em>Something Else</em> and <em>Village Green Preservation Society</em> to 1969's <em>Arthur, or the Decline And Fall of the British Empire</em> is a spectacular four-LP run that established Ray Davies as one of the keenest observers of British society and cemented the band's influence and legacy. It's hard to go wrong skipping around the first few discs of this set, though the rough demo of ""Dead End Street"" and the twice-aborted rehearsal of ""Come on Now"" are poor substitutes for the familiar versions.</p>
<p>A host of non-album tracks make this section particularly rewarding. ""Autumn Almanac"" is practically a blueprint for XTC, the radio session version of Dave Davies' overlooked and excellent ""Love Me Till the Sun Shines"" burns with sharp intensity, Dutch B-side ""This Is Where I Belong"" was justly included on <em>Kink Kronikles</em> and sounds no less vital here, and the haunting piano-and-vocal cast-off ""I Go to Sleep"" is simply gorgeous<em></em>. Early outtakes ""A Little Bit of Sunlight"" and ""This I Know"" also hit the British Invasion sweet spot. It's a crime that the band was kept out of the U.S. by an American Federation of Musicians ban during its most creative period, but the band became so quintessentially English during that period that it's possible American audiences wouldn't have been receptive anyway.</p>
<p>The Kinks' golden era extended into the 70s with the <em>Lola Vs Powerman &amp; the Moneygoround</em> and <em>Muswell Hillbillies</em> LPs, which are amply represented. It's also nice to hear three tracks from the soundtrack to the comedy <em>Percy</em>, which has long been treated like a bastard child in the band's discography. ""The Way Love Used to Be"" is an especially great song, a dark, moody ballad sweetened by lush orchestration. The <em>Muswell</em> album found Ray Davies taking a break from incisively and sympathetically critiquing British society to instead indulge a little second-hand Americana. Bassist Peter Quaife had exited the band in 1969, and the Davies brothers and drummer Mick Avory had expanded the band to include a full-time keyboardist-- John Gosling's warm Hammond organ and tack piano deepened the Americanness of songs like ""Muswell Hillbilly"" and ""20th Century Man"". ""Alcohol"", presented here in a live version, echoes some of the music hall traditions that would become the band's staple reference point in the mid-70s.</p>
<p>During the Kinks' time at RCA in the 70s, Ray Davies indulged in a series of poorly received concept albums that don't wear nearly as well today as the band's 60s output, but there are quite a few gems hidden away in this period, which comprises the bulk of Disc Four. The two-part would-be rock opera <em>Preservation</em> had an endearingly rough sound (it was some of the first material recorded at the band's own Konk studios), but the inclusion of female backing vocalists and a horn section in the band didn't always add much to the songs. The other two albums from this period, <em>Soap Opera</em> and <em>Schoolboys in Disgrace</em>, a sequel to <em>Preservation</em> that focused on the villain, Mr. Flash, are scantly represented with three total tracks, but the choices are inspired: <em>Soap Opera</em>'s ""Holiday Romance"" is a wonderful music hall throwback with hints of Noel Coward, while the loan <em>Schoolboys</em> track, ""No More Looking Back"", is a cinematic preview of 90s Britpop, from Dave's harmonized lead guitar intro to Ray's perceptive lyrics about the way people who've left us linger in strange ways. If this set were more interested in telling the story of the band, it probably would have also included ""The Hard Way"", a heavy track that anticipated the band's late-70s shift to slick hard rock and became a concert staple.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The band's six hard rock albums for Arista, released from 1977 through 1984, represent their most misunderstood period. Some fans of the band's 60s output dismiss it entirely, and it's certainly not up to that standard, but very little is. They experienced their biggest success in the U.S. during this period (1979's <em>Low Budget</em>, at #11, was their highest-charting US album), and they were at the peak of their concert drawing power, touring almost constantly back and forth across the Atlantic. Oddly, they were making corporate rock just as their old music returned to vogue as inspiration for British punks, with the Jam covering ""David Watts"". There is a fair amount of good stuff on these albums, but you have to dig more for it, and not all of it is here. The two biggest omissions are ""Juke Box Music"" and ""Around the Dial"", which is sort of an old crank's companion to Elvis Costello's ""Radio Radio"".</p>
<p align=""justify"">Some of what has been included just misses the mark. <em>Low Budget</em> in particular is crammed with lame songs like ""Attitude"", a terrible diatribe that's the exact opposite of the empathetic, detailed storytelling Ray Davies excels at. Even some of the better songs from this period, like the slow character study ""Rock and Roll Fantasy"", lack the wit and insight of ""Two Sisters"" and ""Sunny Afternoon"". ""Destroyer"", though, is a slaying, rambunctious rock track that revisits Ray's encounter with Lola the next day to hilarious effect. The band is also effective on ""Sleepwalker"" and ""Misfits"", nicely summing up modern alienation on the latter with the line ""Take a real good look around. The misfits are everywhere."" The relative rarities form this period are mostly lackluster. The ebulliently nostalgic storytelling of ""Come Dancing"" is here as a weak demo, while ""Maybe I Love You"" is an inconsequential nothing from the scrap heap. ""Nuclear Love"" is an enjoyable excursion into near-New Wave but hardly essential.</p>
<p>As the band's Arista deal wrapped up with <em>Word of Mouth</em> in 1984, they were already falling back out of commercial favor (they'd never really returned to it in the UK), and long-simmering tension between Dave Davies and Mick Avory led to the drummer's exit, much to Ray's dismay. Most of Disc Six is given to the post-Avory era, when the band wandered in the commercial wilderness, recording weak hard rock albums that are scarcely worth summarizing with a track or two, much less hearing in their entirety. The studio leftover ""Million Pound Semi-Detached"" is the most charming thing from that period included here, in part because it sounds like it was recorded at Konk in the mid-70s, but also because Ray's wit has returned in its tale of a couple buying a house, raising a family, and generally living the dream, only to find that the dream left out all the boredom and frustration. It was their best comment on the State of British Life since Dave's post-Empire lament ""Living on a Thin Line"", from 1984.</p>
<p>The set wraps up with the final Kinks material, from 1993's <em>Phobia</em> and their last record, the hodgepodge <em>To the Bone</em>. Bizarrely, there are five songs from <em>Phobia</em>, and not one of them is ""Hatred (A Duet)"", the only truly great Kinks song from the band's final decade together. That song features Dave and Ray satirizing their own famously stormy working relationship, but the songs here don't even approach that level of humor or humanity. It's little wonder that hardly anyone noticed when the band split in 1996.</p>
<p>Perhaps the ultimate drawback of covering the Kinks' entire <em>oeuvre</em> on one set is the need to tack on songs from their most irrelevant records. It's difficult to discern precisely who the audience for this set is-- the band's hardcore fans will appreciate most of the rarities, but this is not a catch-all for Kinks odds and sods, and the sheer volume of material that any true fan already owns means that the set is a pricey way to get what rarities there are. If you're new to the band and absolutely require a career overview before going straight to the essential late-60s albums, Castle's <em>Ultimate Collection</em>, which covers up to 1984, is a much more solid introduction.</p></div>"|12554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12554-picture-book/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Of course, with drum'n'bass having spent more than a decade pounding ""dancefloor energy"" into an ideas-devoid mono-groove, it's worth examining whether the prior phase of decadent gentrification was really all its detractors claim it to be. Listening to Goldie's bloated 2xCD debut <em>Timeless</em> again, what irritates isn't the presence of noodling saxophones so much as the suspicion that Goldie thought it took a saxophone to make jungle epic. Orbital, with the clear vision sometimes gifted to outsiders, proved on their 1994 faux-jungle stab ""Are We Here?"" that the real possibility of the ""epic"" in jungle was hidden within the beat programming, offering up a broiling sea of slithering, snake-like drums. <br/><br/>I like to think Orbital had been listening to A Guy Called Gerald (aka Gerald Simpson), who a year later released perhaps the only drum'n'bass album to successfully match gentrification with a consistent focus on ""rhythmic danger."" It's this, together with the album's scarcity, that has long made <em>Black Secret Technology</em> a much-touted candidate for ""best jungle album ever."" Previously, though, listeners had to imagine an ideal version of this music, squinting their ears to hear past the (diametrically flawed) murkiness or limp politeness of the mastering on the album's two prior releases. Thankfully, this new remaster of the original 1995 release achieves the best of both worlds, capturing the density of the original productions with a sharpness and force that was hitherto missing.¬† <br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest achievement of <em>Black Secret Technology</em> was to break so radically with many of his peers' presumption of an inverse relationship between rhythmic complexity and musical sophistication. Blending in with the class of 95's aspirational mood-- albeit offering a more minimalist, Detroit-inspired take on it-- Gerald laces his productions with soft-centred synth pads, slightly moody soulful diva soundbites, precariously wafting flute samples, and eerie strings. But all this remains a foil for the unrepentant, rumbling boom of the bass-- and especially the beats. There is simply no other single-artist jungle album that pushes consciousness-altering beat programming as far, as fearlessly, as it is pushed here.¬† <br/><br/>Indeed, when it comes to rhythms this album is an embarrassment of riches. ""The Reno"" features cyborg drummers that seem to multiply before your eyes (or ears), the rhythm doubling over itself again and again while a diva cries ""eeeh yeah-eh-eh-eh,"" all swirling with a viscosity reminiscent of DJ Pierre's ""Wild Pitch"" house sound. On ""Survival"", chattering time-stretched snares are progressively shattered into smaller and smaller pieces, until the groove resembles a fractured Cubist portrait of itself. On ""Dreaming of You"", snippets of hand-percussion seem to rise and curl around your eardrums like steam. Most amazingly, the ravished and ravishing ""Cyberjazz"" is possessed with convulsive shudders, beats fluttering with a stop-start nervous intensity that evokes a myriad of electric synapses flickering on and off.¬† <br/><br/>Gerald's approach to rhythm is almost decadent at times: frequently, painstakingly assembled interlocking layers of beats are placed almost on the edge of conscious awareness, or otherwise punchy rhythms become swallowed up in tidal swells of infra-red bass. On gorgeous reggae-jungle single ""Finley's Rainbow"" the astonishing, counter-intuitive beats rain down with murderous fury somewhere far off in the distance; the effect is like watching a thunderstorm over a distant bay, with only brief moments of being lashed by the hail and the lightning. At times this can be slightly frustrating; at others I'm reminded of that strange combination of harmony and headwreck that krautrockers Can concocted on <em>Future Days</em> (ironically or fittingly, Gerald's greatest ever attempt to toughen up his mindboggling mid-nineties aesthetic remains his remix of Can's ""Tango Whiskeyman"").¬† <br/><br/>Like Can, Gerald understood that the division between ""head music"" and ""body music"" is false and unnecessary: <em>Black Secret Technology</em> achieves its sense of hypnotic drift through panoramic rhythmic compulsion, supplying a frictionless endorphin high that only comes with a massive expense of physical energy. Gentrification? More like a very noble savagery.</p></div>"|12523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12523-black-secret-technology/|8.7|Tim Finney

During the 1950s and 60s, they had hits with secular and nonsecular songs alike, which cemented their legacy as one of country's most conflicted acts: On guitar, Charlie was sensible and earnest, but Ira, playing mandolin, was temperamental and worldly.

While he's not nearly as vocally agile as he was decades ago, he does sound better-- stronger, clearer-- than he did on last year's <i>Charlie Louvin</i>. On <i>Steps to Heaven</i>, he sounds plucky and rejuvenated, tearing into these ten hymns with spirited reverence and hitting even the high notes confidently and happily. Producer Mark Nevers (best known for his work with Lambchop) sets him in a casual church service setting, backed primarily by Lee Derrick's rollicking piano and a bold backing choir that occasionally intrudes on Louvin's leads.

Louvin sounds spry on opener ""Darling Corey"" (featuring Andrew Bird on fiddle) and ""Dixie Boll Weevil"", on which he voices both the farmer and the destructive beetle. Most of the album, however, is much more somber and often elegant, with Louvin relating these stories with an easy, earthy gravity, as if he's singing about people he has known personally. ""The Little Grave in Georgia"" sets the mournful story of a dead teenager against a soft two-step, and ""Mary of the Wild Moor"", which was among the first songs Charlie and his brother performed as teenager, sounds especially stately in this arrangement.

But across a few decades and three projects, he's made it sound remarkably easy, like these tunes just drop out of his sleeves on slow afternoons. That's the common thread running through his work, from Slowdive (the dreamy English shoegaze act he started with) to Mojave 3 (a brand of dreamy Americana) to his solo records (on which he barely seems to have changed out of his pajamas)-- he writes sleepy, graceful pop songs like there's no higher calling on earth, and all signs suggest it comes naturally. A guitar, a handful of chords, and a lilting mumble, and he always provides something that works.<br/><br/><em>Oh! Mighty Engine</em> is his second solo record, following 2002's well-liked <em>Sleeping on Roads</em>. That first album's name seemed apt: Halstead's music is good company for travel and sleep both. This new album's name isn't so apt, though, either in its old-folkie implications or the suggestion that there's any kind of internal combustion involved here, any aspiration toward the ""mighty"". This record comes to us via Brushfire, Jack Johnson's Hawaii-based label, and the fit's a surprisingly good one: Years away from those stylish shoegazer days, Halstead passes awfully well as a beardy beach-bound slacker, standing contentedly in Californian sun instead of English rain, a guitar on the passenger seat and a surfboard on the roof.<br/><br/>And this record, I'm guessing, sounds a lot better if you live someplace where you can drive barefoot, interact with natural bodies of water, own multiple large dogs, or see stars at night. Mostly it's just Halstead and a nylon-stringed guitar, recorded with warmth and space to spare, cooing about fireflies and seeing the good in people. You might think it was an insult if I said I'm occasionally put in mind of Jackson Browne, but I'm betting Halstead wouldn't; after all, Jackson Browne wrote Nico's ""These Days"", and I suspect Halstead's trying to do something similar with ""Sometimes the Wheels"". Shakers, light drumming, pedal steel, and a few keyboards swoop through, but none of them are looking to mess with the heavy lidded vibe of Halstead's songs and harmonies, whether it's the lush, sunny ones or the starker, darker, Nick Drake-style numbers. These sounds fill up a space beautifully, it's true, hushing all other noise in a way that's hard not to feel contented by-- and decent melodies still seem to be dropping out of Halstead's sleeves as reliably as ever. Put some of these songs on, and you can nearly feel yourself standing in a big empty house on a warm evening, can nearly smell the tea lights.<br/><br/>Only... where oh where's the ""mighty""? Even if you haven't been following Halstead down these lines for a while, you might find yourself annoyed by that contentedness, or by the laid-back commonplaces of the lyrics. This is the problem with the beach bum as artist, after all: You get a lot of vague reassurances concerning what life's like (and stabs at bemused charm like ""Baby, I Grew You a Beard""), but never do you get anything in the way of fire, of fear, of desolation, of crisis, or of real human detail. <em>Oh! Mighty Engine</em> is endlessly pleasant but oddly faceless, a record strangely free of feeling. Maybe grand gestures just aren't what Halstead's selling with his solo work, sure; there's nothing wrong with soundtracking people's breezy nights this well, especially as a sort of side project. But think back on the records like this that really stick with you, and it's always the ones with a face, a strangeness, an ineffable quality that sets them apart. There are times when Halstead really has that, but this isn't quite one of them.</p></div>"|12549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12549-oh-mighty-engine/|5.9|Nitsuh Abebe

This music causes otherwise-mild, thirtysomething white men to abandon more practical pursuits in order to sing open-hearted songs of sexless yearning brimming with sha-la-las, handclaps, and chiming 12-string guitar. Robert Pollard-- schoolteacher turned indie rock star-- is the drunken patron saint of this set, and every year brings a new batch of hopefuls in the ""perfect three-minute Merseybeat-era pop tune"" sweepstakes, the Kinks, Hollies and Dave Clark Five records of their (or their father's) youth ringing in their ears.</p><p>Keeping with the trend, all members of Army Navy were otherwise engaged when lead singer and songwriter Justin Kennedy, then working as a wardrobe stylist, assembled them. With the assistance of one disproportionately famous member-- Pete Thomas, former drummer for the Attractions (Doug Randall and Josh Zetumer also play here, and Randall is the band's current drummer)-- they have crafted a bubbly, effervescent valentine to obscure power pop bands of the late 1970s and early 80s. Their self-titled debut combines the perky bounce of the original bands with the beefed-up sonics of the 90s revivalists like the Posies and Teenage Fanclub, and the results are infectious enough to inspire a whole new batch of misbegotten hopefuls.¬†</p><p>Kennedy's songwriting references so many sources that trying to figure out exactly which three or four guitar bands he's channeling should provoke heated discussion. For a rock critic, tracking all the echoes quickly becomes madman's work: the soft bed of guitars that opens ""Saints"" is pure Teenage Fanclub, for instance, while Kennedy's bright, nasal tenor is a dead ringer for Apples in Stereo's Robert Schneider at some points and eerily reminiscent of the dB's' Chris Stamey at others. In any case, the constant low-grade d√©j√† vu is a boon in an intentionally derivative subgenre like power pop, where being a well-studied song encyclopedia is half the point.¬†</p>
<p>The other half, of course, is to write songs that are great by themselves, and <em>Army Navy</em> is a blast even if you've never heard of Bomp! Records. The melodies expertly blend heartache and insouciance, so even when Kennedy offers something as pointed as ""Believe me when I call and I say/ The next girl that I love won't be a saint/ Now go away,"" it sighs rather than sneers. Contemplative midtempo numbers like ""Slight of Hand"", ""In the Lime"", and the achingly pretty ""Golden Pony"" split time with upbeat rockers like ""My Thin Sides"", where the hyperactive drumming buoys a jigging little guitar figure. Nearly every track boasts a breakdown or a bridge as fully realized and catchy as the enormous choruses: Kennedy is the kind of guy who believes firmly in the power of the middle eight.</p>
<p>But the classic moment, the three minutes of pure alchemy that capture the swagger, vulnerability, and goofy joy that defines the best of power pop, comes from the single cover-- Maxine Nightingale's 1975 smash ""Right Back Where We Started From"". It's a head-smackingly perfect song choice: a time-warp and a gender-warp, a boy singing a girl's song that was written during the disco era to remind people of the Motown era. The guitars shimmer, groove, and swing; pianos pound while handclaps ricochet off the downbeat; and Pete Thomas does the big-beat Dave Clark Five caveman pound on the chorus, which comes back again and again, never losing an ounce of joyousness.¬†It's exactly this sort of effortless charm that causes accountant dads to start eyeing their long-dormant six-strings.</p></div>"|12522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12522-army-navy/|7.8|Jayson Greene

Thanks to YouTube, bit torrents, and YouSendIt-style file-transfer sites, amateur concert recordings are available as never before, almost instantly, to anyone in the world who wants to hear them. At the same time, indie listeners' growing acceptance of electronic-based music has made for live shows that are more about fans' communal experiences than any notes actually being played ""live""-- just ask anyone who has ever seen Girl Talk, or go pick up Justice's unconventional <em>A Cross the Universe</em> live CD. It's no surprise, then, that some of last year's most rewarding live albums came from the vaults: Otis Redding's <em>Live in London and Paris</em>, Neil Young's <em>Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968</em>.<br/><br/>Jos√© Gonz√°lez, the brooding Swedish bard of Argentine breeding, is in some ways a throwback to that earlier era. The songs on Gonz√°lez's haunting sophomore album, 2007's <em>In Our Nature</em>, have the focused political fury and stripped-down arrangements of another generation of acoustic troubadours. But Gonz√°lez's minimalist folk-pop shows a painterly appreciation for the nuances of organic sound-- a foot tap here, an off-mic murmur there-- that you won't find from your average coffeehouse singer-songwriter. The nine-song, half-hour <em>Live At Park Avenue</em> EP (available via ThinkIndie or in certain independent record stores) exemplifies one way to keep live recordings relevant at a time when they, like recorded music itself, are both ubiquitous and underappreciated. Although it can't capture all the subtlety of Gonz√°lez's studio output, the EP is also an ideal introduction for Gonz√°lez noobs.<br/><br/>Park Avenue CD in Orlando, Fl., isn't exactly Carnegie Hall, but the instore crowd gives Gonz√°lez's slow, moody polemics the kind of patient silence that never ceases to amaze me about the audience on Bob Dylan's <em>Live at Carnegie Hall 1963</em> EP. The five songs from <em>In Our Nature</em> on <em>Live At Park Avenue</em> are clandestine descendants of protest songs like ""With God on Our Side"". Written after reading atheist extraordinaire Richard Dawkins, ""Abram"" blasts organized religion over descending acoustic guitar arpeggios gentle enough to cut the bitterness-- ""well, most of the time."" The terrible prophecies coursing through the percussive bass lines of ""How Low"" (performed here with murmuring introspection that belies its political fire) and the droning high strings of ""Down the Line"" will outlive the Bush administration-- and, I'm sorry to say, the Obama administration, too. Gonz√°lez directs the intimate, elemental ""Time to Send Someone Away"" at someone who goes ""walking over bodies/ just to witness something new""; you think Gonzo's in for that? No way, Jos√©. ""The Nest"" is about birds the way ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"" is about Aesop's entomology research. <br/> <br/> The philosophical underpinnings of the songs from Gonz√°lez's <em>Pink Moon</em>-esque debut album, <em>Veneer</em>, come to the surface next to his <em>In Our Nature</em> material. Pensive charmer ""Deadweight on Velveteen"" opens <em>Live at Park Avenue</em> with a slightly brighter guitar tone than its <em>Veneer </em>original, though still fuming against base dishonesty. With a refrain as catchy as its main guitar figure is repetitive, ""Hints"" shifts from Gonzalez's usual second-person lyrics to the first-person plural, including us in a community of independent thinkers; the flattery works. Vivid <em>Veneer</em> standout ""Crosses"", like the religious icons of its title (or Massive Attack), offers protection, and Gonz√°lez doesn't disappoint on probably his best-known number, ""Heartbeats"". The imagery of devils, wolf's teeth, and hands from above goes a long way to explain why the Knife's song suits his repertoire so well.<br/> <br/> <em>Live at Park Avenue </em>EP features near-flawless performances of most of  Gonz√°lez's best songs, and the sound quality is fine, if a bit less appealing than on his lo-fi debut or its immaculately recorded sequel. There's little in the way of between-song banter, and the tracks stay pretty faithful to the originals. So if you already have the albums, this EP is a lovely live document-- just don't expect anyone to break new ground. Although an artist's ability to play well live on traditional (read: non-electronic) instruments has fuck-all to do with the quality of his records, live performances of those records tend to be more enjoyable when the performers-- imagine this-- know what they're doing. Gonz√°lez's harrowing way with an acoustic guitar will be sure to please stuffy authenticity squares as well as listeners more interested in minor-key artistic relevations. But don't hold that against him.</p></div>"|12553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12553-live-at-park-avenue-ep/|7.7|Marc Hogan

But for their entry in Fabric's DJ series-- which features the silliest Fabric opening since Carl Craig flipped the Ying Yang Twins into Kraftwerkian sex music, and closes with a synth-rock sugar rush-- Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani have turned in a party mix. Of course, ""party mix"" is relative; you may not set your shindigs off with stripped-down, disco-era dubs. But though good parties aren't usually remembered for their restraint, it's actually the duo's classicism that gives <em>Fabric 43</em> its edge in a crowded mix market.<br/><br/>Rather than regurgitating hook after exhausting hook in crowd-pleasing desperation, the duo flaunts an old-school DJ's assurance, knowing when to let a beat ride and when to jolt a groove with a punchy snatch of vocal. Expert pacing will always draw in the dance snobs, but there are few ""songs"" here. It'll help the less-committed to approach <em>Fabric 43</em> with at least a dollop of love for disco in its many forms, from hyper-syncopated minimalism to hyper-sexed bubblegum. If swinging 4/4 drums don't automatically float your boat, Metro Area's committed to rhythmic variety in the name of maintaining home-listening interest. Just when you're worn out on trad disco beats, here comes a barrage of grungy, stuttering Chicago house snares, or brooding synth-rock drums swept away by a bright burst of piano-and-strings.<br/><br/>And so on, sliding from mood to mood and era to era without disrupting the mix's creamy flow. Even vocally, the gospel-derived call-and-response and ecstatic R&amp;B harmonies of the American disco tradition are liberally spiked with the arch Anglo melodrama and chintzy Euro playfulness that made up disco's internationalist wing. As the mix passes the halfway mark, ""playful"" actually becomes the watchword: a squelching, stomping electro-disco remake of the Temptations' ""Cloud Nine"" that says to hell with everything but the chorus; Plez's acid house one-off ""I Can't Stop"", which sounds like a bilious lothario grunting his way through a John Carpenter outtake; an outro by noted masters of high-seriousness Devo. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll occasionally cringe with glee at a synth hook that's just a little <em>too</em> ostentatious. Something for everyone.<br/><br/>Well, sort of. Technically flawless and plenty of fun-- it <em>is</em> a disco mix, however dub-fixated the duo's taste in the genre-- <em>Fabric 43</em> probably still isn't for casual listeners who buy the occasional DJ mix for novelty's sake. For fans, those left-field choices usually work to reinforce the upscale boogie aesthetic Geist and Jesrani mapped seven long years ago on <em>Metro Area</em>, rather than exploring more recent trends in DJ's passing off rock and prog tunes as ""disco"" for an audience reared on VH1 clips of Gloria Gaynor. But the duo's smooth, mid-tempo foundation sprouts enough surprises to make the mix stand out from the 21st-century disco-mix glut and the Fabric series' own inconsistent late-decade quality control. (The brilliantly orchestrated, rapid-fire vocal overlaps of Data's ""Blow"", its sassy ""whoa's"" flying like neon bullets in a new wave-era action flick, actually made me catch my breath on first listen.) And it would be a shame if this consistently listenable late 2008 release got lost in the rush to see the year off.</p></div>"|12551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12551-fabric-43/|6.9|Jess Harvell

Where does one even start? There is so much music there, some of it extant only on worn-out 78s, moldy reels, or ultra-fragile cylinders, with scarce documentation a chronic ailment of the oldest recordings. In searching for an organizing principle, Damon Albarn's Honest Jon's label has settled on probably the most logical ones available: geography, timeframe, and culture. They've been here before with their superb <em>London Is the Place for Me</em> series, but <em>Living Is Hard</em> is one of their first releases in an ambitious mining project that aims to bring EMI's 1920s ethnic recordings back from the abyss of obscurity. The recordings on the disc were made in London by an assortment of visiting and resident West African musicians and singers for the Zonophone label, which then marketed the recordings almost exclusively in West Africa.</p><p>The Zonophone label has convoluted roots, stretching back to the founding of a talking machine and disc recording company called Zon-O-Phone in Camden, N.J., in 1899. After a series of civil lawsuits (a long story worth reading on its own), the company's European assets were absorbed by the UK-based Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company, later the Gramophone Company, and the parent corporation of His Master's Voice, now more commonly known as HMV. Though the original company died in the 1903 lawsuit, the Zonophone name, de-punctuated, lived on well into the 1980s, and was apparently revived again last year by EMI for a reissue project. For our purposes here, it's most important to know that among its many other uses, the Zonophone name was used from the 1920s through the 50s to market recordings of West African music, primarily in Ghana and Nigeria, which were British colonies at the time.</p><p>This is not a compilation that caters to tastes shaped by rock'n'roll, funk, and soul, as a great many recent African music collections do-- this is primarily folk music, and voices, sometimes with a small amount of percussion, are all that comprise many of these tracks. A few feature heavier percussion, and a bit of guitar on four tracks is the only other instrument you'll hear. Little is known about many of the musicians-- the liner notes tell you what they can, including tidbits about Ben Simmons' African nationalism and informed speculation as to the hometown of Nicholas de Heer.</p>
<p>The tracks featuring guitar fall mostly into a melodic, easygoing style. Harry E. Quashie's ""Anadwofa"" has a similar feel to the highlife that grew to dominate Ghanaian and Nigerian music in the 50s and 60s, and on ""Akuko Nu Bonto"" George Williams Aingo plays in a similar style, but augmented by backing vocals similar to those the answer the lead voice on some of the a cappella tracks included here. The Kumasi Trio's ""Asin Asin Part 2"" tells the story of the group's trip to Britain, mirroring the palmwine style then popular in Ghana, where the band was from (Kumasi is a city in south-central Ghana). The West African Instrumental Quintet's ""Adersu No. 2"" spices it Gold Coast rhythms with a surprising Spanish-influenced guitar part.</p>
<p>Aingo had a second track, and it's one of the most interesting of the a cappella pieces featured. His backing singers give him wordless and very rhythmic phrases that push along his lead vocal, similar to the way the American Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet pushed along its gospel tunes. Prince Zulamkah sounds as if he's in a trance, repeating the same few phrases over and over again to a series of three answers delivered by a small chorus, one of which is ""shingaling."" No word on whether this usage of that word had anything to do with the name of the 60s dance craze, but these musicians wound their way through British music scenes, and in particular the jazz scene, with plenty of contact with Americans, so you never know. My favorite vocal and percussion track is probably John Mugat's ""Bukay"", which is about the funkiest thing I've heard from the 20s-- the hand drums give it a relentless rhythm drive, but even the backing vocals have a kind of stabbing, rhythmic intensity that's very much of a piece with a 70s horn section.</p>
<p>So although this disc isn't meant to compromise with a Western listener, it's still quite easy to listen to if you meet it on its terms. This is a fascinating chapter in the history of global migration, and it could be argued with some success that the 20s were the greatest decade for the preservation of genuine folk music traditions on recordings. The Honest Jon's people have gone all out to make these recordings as clear and present as possible, but source limitations naturally come into play (I happen to like the roomsound element of early recordings).</p>
<p>If this disc piques your interest, I suggest checking out Interstate Music's Heritage imprint, which has compiled the Kumasi Trio twice, once on their own, and again backing Jacob Sam. The company has also released a compilation of the West African Instrumental Quintet, and a Domingo Justus set chronicling his role in the evolution of the juju style. Their <em>Early Guitar Music from West Africa, 1927-1929</em> compilation, while it shares few artists with this set, is also a logical place to investigate further. After one listen to this, you'll likely want to.</p></div>"|12535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12535-living-is-hard-west-african-music-in-britain-1927-1929/|8.0|Joe Tangari

A collaboration between Germans David Moufang (Move D) and Brunn, <em>Songs</em> overlaps little with signpost trends of the past few years, instead grasping for the type of been-there thwump-and-click so familiar you'll struggle to find a buzz-word buzzier than ""techno."" Drawing on almost all of its creators' past dalliances-- trip-hop, trance, minimal, dub, ambient-- <em>Songs</em> is an album that constantly whispers in your year, sometimes literally, and builds damp, murky headspaces out of its elliptical grooves.</p><p>That <em>Songs</em> trends towards the classic techno sounds shouldn't come as a huge surprise: Moufang has been an underground favorite since the early 1990s and Brunn has been releasing singles since 1999. And while this review is a little late on the come-up, make no mistake: <em>Songs</em> marks something of a breakthrough for Brunn and especially Moufang, the type of album that makes even electronic junkies-- those who have long praised Moufang's catalogue-- sit up and notice. <em></em></p><p><em>Songs</em> consists of seven long-form tracks, most of which aim to soundtrack the soft-palate dancefloor in the back of your head. ""Love the One You're With"" encapsulates this cloistered clubby-ness, opening <em>Songs</em> with a chopped vocal sample and slow-change synth notes. A rhythmic chirp, stunted bass sequence, and spacey, panning notes are introduced slowly, like how an innertube sits motionless for a few moments as the motorboat tenses the line.  The ingredients undoubtedly sound familiar, but Brunn and Moufang make subtle upgrades: The high-pitched chirp that anchors the track sounds like an insect, while the clipped vocals are indecipherable speech, not song.</p>
<p>""Love the One You're With"" is the first of three long tracks to open <em>Songs</em>, which gives the opening 40 minutes of the album a hazy, marathon feel. ""Honey"" ramps up the fastest, beginning with skittish bass notes before Moufang and Brunn coax out a quick 4/4 kick. The track is an exercise in tempo: Long ambient drones contrast with flurries of rainbow notes and taut rhythms. ""Velvet Paws"" searches purposefully without ever wandering, as Moufang and Brunn tend to the track's early morning orbits with patient, veteran fingers.</p>
<p>The prize at the end of the three-headed marathon is <em>Songs</em>' most singular track, ""Like a Restless Sea"", which loops a whispered refrain-- ""The wind that moves the trees like a restless sea""-- over distended, subtly rhythmic keyboard noise. Indeed, most of the motion in the track is provided by its hushed voice-- a stressed syllable on ""rest"" serves as the track's tether-- and the result sounds like Moufang and Brunn singing a lullaby to house music.</p>
<p>Album closer ""Radar"", clocking in at nearly 21 minutes, sounds forward and flirtatious, a bulbous, trance-y floor-filler that dissipates into murky, rhythmic clatter and one miniature, exhilarated voice. Moufang and Brunn have long proved themselves bright, dedicated composers, but <em>Songs</em> represents a new high for both: a careful, vibrant long-player from two unheralded 12"" warriors that should make thoughts and soles move with equal grace.</p></div>"|12539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12539-songs-from-the-beehive/|8.1|Andrew Gaerig

Like boy/girl outfits Mates of State and Georgie James, who have found success with hard/soft vocal combinations, poppy arrangements, and elegant poetry about existential despair, Rainer Maria got their yin/yang balance right most of the time. They dissolved in 2006, and former member Kyle Fischer released a solo album earlier this year called <em>Black Milk</em>. Fischer went deeply internal on this winning record, wrapping his songs in layers of dense post-production.</p><p>The solo debut from another Rainer Maria alum, Caithlin De Marrais, has nothing to hide behind, however. Though also co-produced and engineered by Fischer (De Marrais' ex-boyfriend), <em>My Magic City</em> has minimal overdubs and really consists of little more than her voice. Okay, technically, there are unobtrusive acoustic guitar parts and soft piano, but her pipes are nearly always front-and-center in the songs. This is understandable. On Rainer Maria records, or when she performs with Brooklyn-based collective Balthrop, Alabama, her first-robin-of-the-season melodies are almost always memorable. But whereas in those situations her voice serves as an antidote to those of her less-silky male counterparts', on <em>My Magic City</em> it's pretty much all her all the time, and occasionally the whole cuppa joe is too sugary.</p><p>The songs are mostly live studio performances recorded in locations including a Carroll Gardens Episcopal church, an upstate cottage, and De Marrais' own apartment. There's no doubt the other players-- good friends and neighbors, most all-- have an easy rapport with her and complement each other well. But in spots the album could use more friction, both in the music and the words. ""Like a watch that I wound until I broke a spring/ Like a lock in a door in which I've broken off the key/ Now I'm holding her heart and I'm risking everything,"" she begins on ""Carefully"", suggesting that conflict lies ahead. But no. ""Let me be true,"" she continues. ""And let me be gentle where there is a gentle need/ Let me love this girl/ Let me love her carefully."" Through much of the album one wishes she wasn't quite so gentle.</p>
<p>Still, it's easy to appreciate her chops, and the tracks that offer narrative intrigue make the disc worthwhile. ""I hate to think of all the time we wasted talking about your crimes/ It's 2 a.m., and there goes the phone again,"" she sings on ""Voicemail"". ""And when mom was in the hospital/ We came to visit one and all/ But you refused to go/ What were you thinking?"" (True that, ya jerk.) Closer ""April You Changed Your Mind"", meanwhile, has a driving, insistent quality that demands the listener's attention, like a soft slap to the face. One wishes the rest of the work was similarly aggressive.</p></div>"|12521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12521-my-magic-city/|6.8|Ben Westhoff

Both were conceptually inclined: Eno called himself a ""non-musician,"" while Fripp claimed to be tone deaf and rhythmically impaired when he began playing. Both of them would go on to reinvent their chosen tools-- Eno the studio, Fripp the guitar (he would eventually devise his own standard tuning and picking techniques)-- to suit their unique talents and visions. The two LP-length collaborations they recorded in the 70s, now remastered and reissued by DGM, laid the groundwork for each musician's most iconic works.<br/><br/>One technique is central to both records: the use of two Revox reel-to-reel tape recorders as a primitive looping system, wherein sounds recorded to the first deck resurfaced unpredictably when the tape passed through the second deck. Eno and Fripp didn't pioneer this technique; Terry Riley, among others, had used it before. But Eno would master it in his <i>Ambient</i> albums, where it became an end unto itself, not a background. As Eno refined the technique for the studio, Fripp refined it for the stage in his ""Frippertronic"" performances, which prefigured the use of looping pedals among arty rock bands today. Even in these two early works-- 1973's <i>No Pussyfooting </i>and 1975's <i>Evening Star</i>-- we can begin to track the process's rapid evolution.<br/><br/>On <i>No Pussyfooting</i> (the parentheses that originally enclosed the title are dropped on the reissue), we hear Eno and Fripp discovering the process-- it was the very first thing they recorded together in this vein. The album bursts with a sense of spontaneity. ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" sequence is raw and rambunctious, resolving in long deep waves of aggression, with Fripp's molten, fluent guitar leads putting his rock prowess on display. The effervescent ""Swastika Girls"" strikes a contrast. In fact, ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" and ""Swastika Girls"" seem designed as opposites-- the former gooey, deep, and broadly rolling, the latter effervescent, high, and cramped with wiry spirals. Of course, these tracks lack the sophistication of Eno's later ambient work, where pristine clarity became his focus. Clutter and impulsiveness haunt the margins, especially on ""Swastika Girls"", and Fripp's leads seem to stand somewhat apart from Eno's manipulations on ""Heavenly"". But whatever <i>Pussyfooting </i>lacks in subtlety, it compensates for with sheer mojo.<i><br/><br/>Evening Star</i> demonstrates how quickly Eno and Fripp evolved-- it's confidently serene where <i>No Pussyfooting</i> was brashly assertive, and bears a closer resemblance to the 2004 Eno/Fripp collaboration <i>The Equatorial Stars</i>. Fripp's guitar is less often recognizable as such; we frequently hear what resembles clouds of bowed strings drifting through each other. When it is recognizable, as on the title track, the guitar phrases seem deeply interwoven with the surrounding sounds rather than roaring over them. The album opens with a quartet of naturalistically themed pieces, evoking water, wind, and sky, before delving down with a six-track sequence called ""An Index of Metals"". Not only did Eno and Fripp hone their technique on <i>Evening Star</i>, they erected a thematic architecture, which was absent from <i>No Pussyfooting</i> and would be crucial to Eno's subsequent work.<br/><br/>The only disappointing thing about these reissues is the bonus content. There's none on <i>Evening Star</i>, and <i>No Pussyfooting</i> comes with a second disc of reversed and half-speed mixes. There's an historical precedent for this: Miscuing a tape, John Peel played tracks from <i>No Pussyfooting</i> backwards on his radio show (and it says a lot about this kind of music that only Eno noticed the error), while the slowed-down versions recreate the experience of playing the album, which was originally released on vinyl, at the wrong speed. That's cool, but would have made more sense on a commercial release in 1975. Now that listeners who want to hear music at different speeds can create the effect themselves in a matter of seconds, the bonus disc seems anachronistic.<br/><br/>In his review of <i>The Equatorial Stars</i>, Dominique Leone correctly downplayed the idea that anything was invented on these albums. As previously mentioned, the technique that informed them predated Eno and Fripp. And while Eno made great strides in building a theory of ambient music, the basic challenge-- to make music that took an evasive stance toward form and content-- wasn't new; many modernist composers had already been approaching it in a variety of ways.

Both were conceptually inclined: Eno called himself a ""non-musician,"" while Fripp claimed to be tone deaf and rhythmically impaired when he began playing. Both of them would go on to reinvent their chosen tools-- Eno the studio, Fripp the guitar (he would eventually devise his own standard tuning and picking techniques)-- to suit their unique talents and visions. The two LP-length collaborations they recorded in the 70s, now remastered and reissued by DGM, laid the groundwork for each musician's most iconic works.<br/><br/>One technique is central to both records: the use of two Revox reel-to-reel tape recorders as a primitive looping system, wherein sounds recorded to the first deck resurfaced unpredictably when the tape passed through the second deck. Eno and Fripp didn't pioneer this technique; Terry Riley, among others, had used it before. But Eno would master it in his <i>Ambient</i> albums, where it became an end unto itself, not a background. As Eno refined the technique for the studio, Fripp refined it for the stage in his ""Frippertronic"" performances, which prefigured the use of looping pedals among arty rock bands today. Even in these two early works-- 1973's <i>No Pussyfooting </i>and 1975's <i>Evening Star</i>-- we can begin to track the process's rapid evolution.<br/><br/>On <i>No Pussyfooting</i> (the parentheses that originally enclosed the title are dropped on the reissue), we hear Eno and Fripp discovering the process-- it was the very first thing they recorded together in this vein. The album bursts with a sense of spontaneity. ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" sequence is raw and rambunctious, resolving in long deep waves of aggression, with Fripp's molten, fluent guitar leads putting his rock prowess on display. The effervescent ""Swastika Girls"" strikes a contrast. In fact, ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" and ""Swastika Girls"" seem designed as opposites-- the former gooey, deep, and broadly rolling, the latter effervescent, high, and cramped with wiry spirals. Of course, these tracks lack the sophistication of Eno's later ambient work, where pristine clarity became his focus. Clutter and impulsiveness haunt the margins, especially on ""Swastika Girls"", and Fripp's leads seem to stand somewhat apart from Eno's manipulations on ""Heavenly"". But whatever <i>Pussyfooting </i>lacks in subtlety, it compensates for with sheer mojo.<i><br/><br/>Evening Star</i> demonstrates how quickly Eno and Fripp evolved-- it's confidently serene where <i>No Pussyfooting</i> was brashly assertive, and bears a closer resemblance to the 2004 Eno/Fripp collaboration <i>The Equatorial Stars</i>. Fripp's guitar is less often recognizable as such; we frequently hear what resembles clouds of bowed strings drifting through each other. When it is recognizable, as on the title track, the guitar phrases seem deeply interwoven with the surrounding sounds rather than roaring over them. The album opens with a quartet of naturalistically themed pieces, evoking water, wind, and sky, before delving down with a six-track sequence called ""An Index of Metals"". Not only did Eno and Fripp hone their technique on <i>Evening Star</i>, they erected a thematic architecture, which was absent from <i>No Pussyfooting</i> and would be crucial to Eno's subsequent work.<br/><br/>The only disappointing thing about these reissues is the bonus content. There's none on <i>Evening Star</i>, and <i>No Pussyfooting</i> comes with a second disc of reversed and half-speed mixes. There's an historical precedent for this: Miscuing a tape, John Peel played tracks from <i>No Pussyfooting</i> backwards on his radio show (and it says a lot about this kind of music that only Eno noticed the error), while the slowed-down versions recreate the experience of playing the album, which was originally released on vinyl, at the wrong speed. That's cool, but would have made more sense on a commercial release in 1975. Now that listeners who want to hear music at different speeds can create the effect themselves in a matter of seconds, the bonus disc seems anachronistic.<br/><br/>In his review of <i>The Equatorial Stars</i>, Dominique Leone correctly downplayed the idea that anything was invented on these albums. As previously mentioned, the technique that informed them predated Eno and Fripp. And while Eno made great strides in building a theory of ambient music, the basic challenge-- to make music that took an evasive stance toward form and content-- wasn't new; many modernist composers had already been approaching it in a variety of ways. But art always evolves that way, with old ideas recombining into new forms, embodied in but not created by specific individuals. Eno and Fripp invented something more tangible than an abstract cultural movement here: They invented themselves, and a way of thinking about music that was not so much novel as perfectly of the moment, alive to its unique technological and conceptual possibilities. They irrevocably altered the course of art music in the process.</p></div>"|12546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12546-no-pussyfooting-evening-star/|8.6|Brian Howe

But for the three San Franciscans-cum-Brooklynites in the band Lemonade, it's what you get when music blogs serve a new dance-music subgenre, umpteenth post-punk revival, and hot world-music trend on a weekly basis-- you process the best bits into something practical and satisfying. <br/><br/>The six extended tracks on the band's self-titled debut are rife with rhythmic density and intensity, but smartly sequenced into two halves that each follow the peak/valley/peak arc that rock listeners demand of Proper Albums.¬† Lemonade seem especially aware of this conversion process: Their record vividly replicates that first sensation of losing yourself in a peak-hour, strobe-lit reverie, where the communal act of dancing teeters between liberation and disorientation. <br/><br/>Evocative opener ""Big Weekend"" establishes the theme, luring you in with familiar devices: drummer Alex Pasternak lays down a kick-drum thump and cowbell clatter that approximates the polyrhythimic pulse of Liquid Liquid, while a 303 synth riff and frontman Callan Clendenin's Ibiza-evoking lyrics further enhance the 80s flashback. But following a mid-song breakdown, Pasternak's drumming turns more fiercely tribal and Clendenin's voice is refashioned into a stream of distorted and mutated squeals, providing an early indication that Lemonade's definition of dancefloor abandon also includes the bad-trip flipside, further revealed by the industrialized schaffel swing of ""Unreal"". The spastic, devolutionary disco of ""Real Slime"" provides a more explicit affront to ecstasy-induced enlightenment, with Clendenin admonishing his hippy-dippy target to ""scrape the fluoride out of your encrusted third eye.""<br/><br/>With their muscular, aggressive approach to dance music, Lemonade operate from a similar base as other percussive post-punk new-schoolers, from party-starting outfits like !!! and Professor Murder to more abrasive acts like Aa and Liars. But the trio strike a singular balance between weird and wired: eight-minute centerpiece ""Nasifon"" finds Clendenin's voice sliding further into indecipherability-- imagine <em>Metal Box</em>-era John Lydon bellowing out Sigur R√≥s' Hopelandic lyric sheet-- but layers it with Arabic-accented melodies, machine-gunned synths and a pounding 4/4 beat that would go over both in Williamsburg warehouse parties and Dubai super clubs. <br/><br/>And if the queasy, grime grind of ""Sunchips"" sputters on about twice as long as it needs to, it makes the arrival of spectacular closer ""Blissout"" all the more rewarding. On an album that's been mostly concerned with the feeling of losing control, ""Blissout"" provides Lemonade with a hard-earned moment clarity: Clendenin's uncharacteristically stoic vocal calmly rides atop a cheery hi-NRG beat and acid-soaked synths, before a twinkling piano refrain and chopped-up vocals announcing the band's name trigger a big-beat blowout, with Clendenin's ecstatic, echo-laden exclamations summoning the break of dawn. As the track fades, it's overcome by a chorus of sampled voices all uttering the same statement: ""we're all having a good time."" Given Clendenin's cryptic, fragmented approach to singing, you can't fault Lemonade for using these dying seconds to state the obvious.</p></div>"|12542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12542-lemonade/|8.3|Stuart Berman

On previous albums he's addressed television coverage of Warren Zevon's death (""Musikbyr√•n Makes Me Wanna Smoke Crack""), a negative record review (""Go to Hell, Miss Rydell""), and his limited fanbase (""Middleclass Kid""), all with caustic wit, self-deprecating humor, and absurdly catchy melodies that make even his harshest comments go down easy. <em>The Lilac Time</em>, his third solo album, continues this op-ed approach, holding forth on cars, airlines, Facebook, Stockholm, and political correctness. The tunes are still there, but something about the album sticks in your craw: Indie pop's favorite grumpus is starting to sound like <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkrHF7ZNXJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andy Rooney</a></strong>.<br><br>""Animal Lovers"" grouses at just what its title suggests: those who love animals but treat people as subhuman. A rhino at the local zoo died, Carlberg recalls, and the citizens mourned the loss, but ""when Grandma died, no one cried."" Everyone has felt this sense of unfairness, but rather than coming across as universal, the song just sounds snippy. ""51,3"", about a disappointing Facebook quiz, and ""Tired of Being PC"", about being well-educated and progressive, fare dismally as well. Carlberg's mock outrage sounds best when it's attached to an equally assertive melody: ""Metal to Metal"", about a lemon that breaks down outside Berlin, contains the album's most insistent hook, which makes the refrain seem like the musings of a truly exasperated man: ""Metal to metal is no good, but stupid to stupid is no better."" Likewise, ""Fly Me to the Moon"" sugarcoats its anti-airline rant (""Cut your costs, but never piss on your passengers"") with handclaps, whistling, and syrupy strings.<br><br>Carlberg is getting older, which makes him not only grouchier but more nostalgic. As the name-dropping title suggests, <em>The Lilac Time</em> is perhaps most concerned with the passage of time and the rosiness of the past. ""Tonight I'll be a teenager again,"" he sings with Club 8's Karolina Komstedt on the upbeat ""Nicknames"", which sounds both triumphant and a little pathetic. ""1983 (Pelle &amp; Sebastian)"" is a spot-on re-creation of a <em>Boy With the Arab Strap</em> outtake in which Carlberg recounts his misadventures hanging out in the city as a teenager. It even ends with a ""A Space Boy Dream""-style monologue that leavens the nostalgia with a dose of public humiliation. <em>The Lilac Time</em> may not be Carlberg's strongest album, but it shows him at least trying to address the trappings of adulthood, no matter how banal they may be.</br></br></br></br></p></div>"|12538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12538-the-lilac-time/|6.2|Stephen M.

Over the span of five albums and numerous singles and EPs as Her Space Holiday, he's worked within the confines of a bedroom lap-pop sound informed by big beat and an occasional dash of IDM while delivering often uncomfortably candid lyrics in a deadpan, nearly anti-melodic whisper. Post-Postal Service, it's not a real growth area. You're accustomed to a certain way of listening to Her Space Holiday, which is why the rippling, <em>Marquee Moon</em>-style major chords and free-to-be-you-and-me lyric of ""The New Kid Revival"" could initially be seen as a daft anti-piracy measure. If you nabbed it as an illegal download, you'd swear some joker had pulled a fast one on you.</p><p>In a Cloud Cult review, I used the term ""unplugged Her Space Holiday"" as somewhat of a joke about a style of music that couldn't possibly exist, but that's pretty much exactly what happens here. I can't vouch for what's gone down in Bianchi's personal life, but <em>XOXO, Panda and the New Kid Revival</em><em> </em>is an album of sobriety and comfort-- ""Used to think that being alone would somehow simplify my life,"" he sings on ""The Heartbreak Moment"", this from the author of ""The Luxury of Loneliness"". It's all relative, though-- ""The World Will Deem Us Dangerous"" follows a flower from a dead relative's grave to the desk of an uninterested crush while Bianchi alludes to mental illness and societal persecution. It's like the entire Eels discography distilled into four minutes.¬†</p><p>But the most obvious turn is instrumental, as the strings that pad out Bianchi's simple, breezy tunes are pulled from the barn rather than the orchestra pit-- yes, the guileless banjo on ""The Truth Hurts So This Should Be Painless"" (okay, maybe <em>some things </em>haven't changed) isn't being played for laughs or ""authenticity,"" and neither is the kazoo that pops up later. While the move to more traditional instrumentation and songwriting was likely a necessary move for Bianchi, it was also an incredibly risky one-- he's very much aware of the limitations of his voice, and on 2003's ""Meet the Pressure"", he likened criticism to asking a blind man if he knows that he can't see. It could just be one of those situations where everything sounds better when you turn it up loud, since the insistent double-tracking lends Bianchi a tart, nasal tone resembling Kevin Barnes kicked out of the theatre troupe or even Isaac Brock. If he's dealing in unfamiliar ground, it's no surprise that Bianchi is seeking clear guidepoints. It's hard not to hear ""The Year in Review"" (as well as ""The Day in Review"") as Bianchi's ""Float On"" moment-- fatalism passing for relative optimism-- even though its descending melody brings up a certain late-period Elliott Smith album (check the title).¬†</p>
<p>But in other ways, <em>XOXO </em>still manages a lonesome, crowded sound. Whether it's the sturdy chord progressions, overstuffed lyrics, or just Bianchi's tendency to avoid with melodies with contours his voice can't match, most of <em>XOXO </em>is likeable, if not a little tough to parse. The gut-punch topicality of older songs like ""Sleepy California"" or ""Girl Problem"" is genuinely missed amidst the occasionally redundant wistful observation and the vocal lines that often veer to close to each other (many can draw similarities to the White Stripes' ""We're Going to Be Friends""). Ultimately, in place of a holding pattern comes a new trouble-- Her Space Holiday, in its previous iteration, was divisive enough to be loved and it had an <em>identity</em>: Every one of their previous albums had a couple of duds, but in the vein of Jamie Stewart or Conor Oberst, imperfection was something of a package deal-- the drunken fight that unintentionally gets to the root of the problem. It's nice that Bianchi spends most of <em>XOXO </em>talking himself away from the ledge, but if he's going to stand out in a rootsy twang &amp; twee field that's already bursting at the seams, it's going to take more than the Sarah Palin platter of brand loyalty and exceeding drastically lowered expectations.</p></div>"|12445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12445-xoxo-panda-and-the-new-kid-revival/|6.0|Ian Cohen

To be fair, Au Revoir Simone aren't treating <em>Reverse Migration</em> as a proper brick-and-mortar release-- it arrives without the usual PR blitz and is available only as a digital download from certain online retailers-- but the album (and others like it, see Stars' disastrous <em>Do You Trust Your Friends?</em>) helps to illustrate the frustrating overabundance of unnecessarily reworked material being hurled at listeners. Want more proof? Take a listen to the bounty of remixes clogging up music-blog aggregators such as Hype Machine and count how few actually move you and how many are there to give bloggers another reason/excuse to keep a band's name in the elbo.ws headlines.<br/><br/>Sadly, the same exercise can be applied here: Despite several high-caliber contributors, <em>Reverse Migration</em> never really gets off the ground. The bulk of its remixers pay too much deference to the source material and wind up with versions that don't enhance their originals. Gothenburg-based electro pop duo Pacific! tries for a Grizzly Bear-ish haunted Americana take on ""Sad Song"", but their gawky rendering falls flat. Darkel (aka Air's Jean-Beno√Æt Dunckel) puts his lunar spin on ""I Couldn't Sleep"", isolating the vocals and sprinkling in some ""Cherry Blossom Girl"" synths, but there's little that's captivating about his mix. And there are a few real stinkers, too: The recreation of ""Stars"" by New York's Disco Pusher has all of the qualities of a cheap dance remix-- a basic 4/4 backing, cheesy vocoders-- without even a trace of originality to wash them down.<br/><br/>A few musicians do manage to score: Sneering UK party starters the Teenagers turn ""Fallen Snow"" into a sinister glitch pop track, their adaptation superior to its precedent and a first cousin of Crystal Castles' menacing 2008 juggernaut ""Untrust Us"". Montag's work on ""A Violent Yet Flammable World"" is equally intriguing; the French-Canadian producer splits the track in half, adding orchestral touches and lush synths to its back end for a vivid, luminous effect.<br/><br/>The record's lone moment of true inventiveness comes from a likely source, Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor, the only artist to use his remix as an opportunity to fabricate an entirely new track. Indeed, his remarkable take on ""Sad Song"" doesn't share as much a note of similarity to its precursor; Taylor mutilates the track and then reconstructs it as an eight-minute future-pop epic packed with mechanical distortions and flapping, rubbery synths. And when Taylor croons in his geeky, guileless manner, ""Play me a sad song... I want you to make me cry"", it comes across as more earnest and believable than when ARS breathily told us the same. It's not enough, this song, to pull <em>Reverse Migration </em>out of the why-do-we-need-this pile, but it helps to remind us what a great remix can be-- how, when done properly, it can elevate the source material and reveal new layers to a song we thought we knew. It's funny to be reminded of this while listening to an album that's constantly trying to persuade us otherwise.</p></div>"|12550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12550-reverse-migration/|3.2|Joe Colly

Back in the late 1980s and early 90s, DJ Shadow put together a series of hip-hop mixes for Bay Area radio station KMEL, and the megamix that appears on <i>The 4-Track Era Volume 1: Best of the KMEL Mixes</i> opens, after a brief DJ intro, with one of those big booming slick laser-explosion-sound station IDs: ""Bustin'<i> oooout, </i>another<i> slammin</i>'<i> non-stop power mix </i>on 106 point<i> one, </i>KME-<i>L FM</i>, San Francisco Oakland San Jose!"" From that bombastic intro, we go into a murky, vinyl-crackle-drenched, assembled-on-tape collection of regional and national underground hip-hop cuts, some original breaks, and the occasional Steinski-esque dialogue clip.¬†<i></i></p>
<p>It's almost inconceivable today that someone doing what Shadow did-- and what Shadow does <i>now</i>, for that matter-- would find their way onto a radio venue more mainstream than a college station. But <i>The 4-Track Era Bundle</i> comes from a fascinating germination period for Shadow-- 1990 to 1992-- where he was an aspiring producer in his late teens getting his foot in the door at a time when 95% of hip-hop was still more or less an underground phenomenon. (The other 5% mostly consisted of the <i>Hammerman </i>cartoon and PSAs where ciphers in five-years-dated Run-DMC outfits crossed their arms and rapped ""I'm so-and-so and I'm here to say that buckling up is A-OK"".) Most people who've followed DJ Shadow's career have done so with his Mo Wax output as the starting point; we were told that the man behind grand artistic statements like ""In/Flux"" and <i>Endtroducing..... </i>was steeped in classic hip-hop fundamentals, and we had to take their word for it. Now we have proof-- and this set doesn't just reveal Shadow's origins, it's a great assemblage of traditional, golden-age-era hip hop turned just a bit sideways.</p>
<p>The first volume, which includes two of the five mixes Shadow put together for KMEL circa 1991, is the most immediately entertaining, as well as one of the more illuminating looks into Shadow's early identity; at one point there's a brief interview interlude where Shadow downplays his nascent production work (""hopefully, y'know, a little bit further in the future that'll be my career or whatever"") and emphasizes his work as a DJ and mix creator. Considering how many of his career highlights come from his mixes, whether collaborating with Cut Chemist (<i>Brainfreeze</i>; <i>Product Placement</i>; <i>The Hard Sell</i>) or going solo (<i>Diminishing Returns</i>; <i>Funky Skunk</i>), it's probably unsurprising how well-paced and unique these early examples of his technique are, even from a 19 year-old.</p>
<p>In the first six minutes of the first mix alone, we get a rowdy g-funk makeover of Kool G Rap &amp; DJ Polo's ""Money in the Bank"", a tweak of Brand Nubian's ""Slow Down"" that adds some severe low-end boost to the track's Edie Brickell-derived beat, and a sharply-cut, scratch-filled rendition of De La Soul's ""Afro Connections at a Hi 5 (In the Eyes of the Hoodlum)"" that subtly ups the pitch and tempo and transforms the track from a plodding spoof of mean-mug hardness into a lively hands-up anthem. The two mixes still focus on what was hot in '91-- the second one prominently features the Geto Boys' ""Mind Playing Tricks on Me"", Cypress Hill's ""How I Could Just Kill a Man"", and Black Sheep's ""Flavor of the Month""-- but the familiarity is tempered by a few period obscurities (J.V.C. F.O.R.C.E.'s ""A Musical Sample""; Downtown Science's ""Radioactive""), a superb mixing job and the restless, unpredictable creativity of a DJ who was just beginning to pull out all the stops to define his own persona.</p>
<p>There's also some valuable stuff in the other two volumes-- one dedicated to non-radio megamixes and a few unreleased remixes, the other comprised of some of Shadow's earliest work, and all of it previously unreleased aside from one track that came out on a difficult-to-find <i>NME</i> freebie cassette. It's here where you get a clearer picture of the artist Shadow would become as a producer-- as well as how severely he transformed between 1992 and 1996. Volume 2's remixes feature the audacious experimentation of an up-and-coming beat constructor who suddenly realizes he's gotten good at what he does. He applies some breakbeat ADD to Eric B. &amp; Rakim's ""Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em"", where the beat changes what seems like every 20 seconds but never falters. The Jungle Brothers' ""Jimbrowski"" gains a stouter drum break, a catchy piano/organ hook and a full-fledged reggae interlude to back up the original's extended ""dreadlock"" conversation. And his reworking of 3rd Bass' ""Wordz of Wisdom"" has the original's Gary Wright break hyperextended, dropping out a few times so Shadow can push the drum track within inches of its life; the damn thing's <i>eight minutes long</i>, and it's amazing.</p>
<p>And while there's nothing quite as transformative or outlandish on Volume 3's collection of early originals, there's still some impressive moments once you take into account that everything was assembled on turntables and that titular 4-Track machine-- no samplers, no computers. Occasionally the results are a little hinky-- the beats in ""DJ Shadow's Theme (Original Version)"" feel a little loose and slippery, while ""Track the Groove"" sounds like a bunch of over-familiar <i>Ultimate Breaks &amp; Beats </i>fodder mixed together-- but hearing the ""You Can Make it if You Try"" break diced up and smothered in rapidfire scratches on ""The Source Is Serious Business"" or the Zep/Hendrix/Doors mainstays of classic rock radio juggled around in ""Rock Lesson"" provides a good idea of where he was headed. And fans of what little vintage Shadow there was to hear before Mo Wax signed him should be geeked to find both an alternative mix of his manic 1991 Steinski homage ""Lesson 4"" and a long-lost, old school funk-heavy all-45 ""Lesson 5"" which predated the similar M.O. of <i>Brainfreeze </i>by a good seven or eight years.</p>
<p>Now here's the cruel part: It's extremely difficult to buy this box set. You could've snagged the individual components a year or two ago, since each volume was included as a throw-in bonus with a t-shirt purchase on DJ Shadow's web store, but as of this writing only Volume 3 is still in print and available. And the box itself-- produced in a limited edition of 200, with another immaculately-constructed KMEL mix thrown in as a fourth-disc bonus-- is already going for stupid money on eBay and Craigslist. It's a bit ironic, now that we finally have officially-released audio documentation of Shadow's formative years, that many fans will probably have to resort to some kind of pirate skullduggery just to hear it. So back to the underground it goes.</p></div>"|12547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12547-the-4-track-era-bundle/|8.7|Nate Patrin

There are certainly fewer dashed expectations. Unlike the group that ostensibly ""discovered"" her (those quote marks should be in 72-point font), Faithfull has carved a niche as a gifted and idiosyncratic interpreter embedded in the present but engaged with the past. In lesser hands, her grainy voice-- impossibly dark and knowing-- might sound gothically cheesy, but she gives herslf over to her songs completely while remaining indelibly, recognizably herself. She's the Helen Mirren of rock'n'roll: a dish in the 1960s who has not only aged incredibly well, but wears her age with as much grace as others wear their youth.<br/><br/>Like her 1987 album <em>Strange Weather</em>, which cemented that reputation, <em>Easy Come Easy Go</em> is a covers album produced by Hal Willner, and a few of the song titles here might suggest something akin to one of those dreadful boomer standards albums or a pathetic attempt by an older artist to connect with the kids. (A U.S. version will be out in March on Decca Records.) But Faithfull is classier than Rod Stewart or Pat Boone, not just because her voice is more appealing, but primarily because she knows to dig deep into an artist's catalog for inspiration. Everything is a standard, if to no one else but herself. So nothing here, not even the Duke Ellington song, sounds like an obvious choice, nor is anything handled predictably. Bessie Smith's ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" becomes a slow-burn vaudeville, layering clarinets over... well, I don't know what it is, but sounds like either a fuzzed-out bassoon or a fuzzed-out bass piano. The effect is uncanny: an eerie approximation of the past that sounds both real and unreal.<br/><br/>There is no guiding conceit to <em>Easy Come Easy Go</em>, no criteria that connects all of Faithfull's sources, which frees her up considerably to find the hidden passages between these disparate songs. Smith and Ellington sit alongside the Decemberists, Neko Case, and Espers, but Faithfull isn't pandering to bloggers and Willner doesn't play Rick Rubin to her Johnny Cash by having her reinterpret modern-rock tunes into novelty. Rather, there are dark themes running through these songs, which evoke different facets of loss and self-destruction. Opening the record, Dolly Parton's ""Down from Dover"" devastates as it recounts a woman's unwanted pregnancy and self-delusion that the father will return. Parton made the narrator's innocence sound immediate, but Faithfull removes herself somewhat from the predicament, her rasp suggesting the passage of time and a life that has gotten no easier. As she sings it, ""Down from Dover"" sounds like¬† a spiritual twin to the Decemberists' ""The Crane Wife 3"", which unthreads some of the same maternal and spousal conflicts and makes the simple melody sound like a descending brushstroke on a clean canvas. <br/><br/>Brian Eno's ""How Many Worlds"" still sounds slight and indifferent, but Randy Newman's ""In Germany Before the War"" could have been written specifically for Faithfull-or at least by Weill. She can't evoke the unbearable sense of loss that the original communicates so easily, but she does conjure her own particularly mournful ambience, as if playing every part (the first-person narrator, the little lost girl) herself. Espers' ""Children of Stone"" is filled with majestic dread that never dissipates over its eight minutes. Her backing band-- including backing vocalist Chan Marshall-- oversell Case's ""Hold On Hold On"", but Faithfull gets the dark self-reckoning just right.<br/><br/>In Europe, Na√Øve is releasing a special edition that includes eight bonus tracks that broaden the scope of the project, if not the depth. Her version of the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's ""Salvation"" tries too hard to replicate the dense sound of the original, which ultimately sounds a bit detached from her vocals. Faithfull sounds more comfortable with the older tracks, savoring the lilting melodies of Judee Sill's ""The Phoenix"" and the traditional ""The Flandyke Shore"", made popular by Nic Jones. She retains the pomp and drama of Morrissey's ""Dear God Please Help Me"", but her duet with Jarvis Cocker on ""Somewhere"" is sadly underwhelming: Their voices contrast nicely-- hers bold and warm, his whispery and conspiratorial-- but the song suits neither of them particularly well. <br/><br/>Faithfull fares better with Antony on Smokey Robinson's ""Ooh Baby Baby"", which stands out from the album proper thanks to its convoluted, shifting arrangement. The song opens with piano glissandos and nightclub vocals before transforming into a girl-group lite-funk vamp. They trade off lead duties, but Faithfull sounds best when she's interjecting ""stronger stronger"" like she's the Antonettes. Throughout its eight minutes, the song stands halfway between the lounge and the dancefloor. It's overlong, extremely gaudy, completely ridiculous, and just wonderful. The song altogether disrupts the album's somberness and glues sequins all over the original, and to her credit, Faithfull attacks it with more spirit than singers half her age could muster. Except maybe Antony.</p></div>"|12548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12548-easy-come-easy-go/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

""Milk is survival."" It's the second half of a Tamashek (aka Tuareg) proverb that begins with the phrase <em>Aman Iman</em>, or ""Water is life."" If you've followed global popular music at all in the last few years, you know that the latter is the title of desert rock standard bearers Tinariwen's superb 2007 album. Terakaft's completion of Tinariwen's thought is no accident-- the two bands are closely linked, and several songs on Terakaft's debut album are written by members of Tinariwen. <em>Ahk Issudar</em> does in some ways feel like a continuation of <em>Aman Iman</em>-- the style is similar but even more stripped down, and the songs have that familiar sense of longing, evoking shifting landscapes in wide open spaces.</p><p>The sound is as basic as possible. The three members all sing and play guitar, and two also play bass. There is no percussion, but one of the guitars typically plays a muted part that provides the illusion of a shaker or small hand drum. The other rhythm guitars tend to hammer away on a pedal tone, often in concert with the bass, which accents the underlying base tone rhythmically, and the lead guitar is cut loose to wander. It's very purposeful wandering, though. The leads soar over the shifting expanse of the rhythm as though navigating by some deeply understood guiding principle.</p><p>The lyrics-- all sung in Tamashek-- visit now-familiar themes of exile and loneliness, while paying tribute to Tuareg heroes, but there's one very glaring exception in ""Amdagh"", a song dedicated to a French zoo director who is working to save the last giraffes in Niger and the wild sheep of the Adrar  Mountains. At first blush, it seems odd for people who are scraping out a living to champion a luxury like conservation, but then two things become clear: One, conservation is really no longer a luxury, and two, these Tamashek bands, in creating a new musical style, are ensuring that their cultural heritage has a vessel to carry it into the future, regardless of what happens to their way of life. In that respect, the zoo keeper is fighting to preserve the character of the desert they call home in much the same way they are-- it's rare that the intersection between cultural preservation and environmental preservation is so clearly elucidated on a record.</p>
<p>What separates this album from those made by Terakaft's colleagues is its uniquely ramshackle approach to what is essentially organic psychedelia. Acoustic guitars make a few appearances, and some songs, such as ""Soubhanallah"", have an open, free-flowing character that makes it feel like they simply blew up off the peak of a dune and became pieces of music. The all-acoustic closer offers a different sound, with more independence for each voice and a folky (in the Western sense) arrangement. This genre has reached a point of diversity where terms like ""desert rock"" and ""desert blues"" have become inadequate-- it needs its own name. <em>Akh Issudar</em>, however it's labeled, is another reminder that this corner of the world is producing some of the best and most rewarding music out there.</p></div>"|12525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12525-akh-issudar/|7.8|Joe Tangari

I've often found myself putting on a record in order to amplify or counteract a specific feeling. If I'm feeling edgy, John Adams' ""Hallelujah Junction"" can make that edginess feel like something productive, while Gas or Eno can soothe it away. If I'm feeling lost in the day, the piano music of Philip Glass can guide me back on track, while Morton Feldman can help me remember that the track is an illusion. And when I'm feeling sentimental and fragile, J√≥hann J√≥hannsson or Eluvium can redeem that fragility into something triumphant.<br/><br/>The unabashed embrace of sentimentality is crucial to both J√≥hannsson and Eluvium's music. Both strive to bypass the brain and go straight for the heart (which, of course, on the compositional end, requires a lot of skill and intelligence). The pleasure they transmit feels effortless-- pure balm reminding us that discord and fracture aren't prerequisites for powerful arrangements. On <em>Miniatures</em>, Matthew Robert Cooper maintains the deep-seated ache that characterizes his music as Eluvium, while pulling back from the opulence of <em>Copia</em>, working in ambient scrimshaw on tiny surfaces. While Eluvium is a professed influence upon Library Tapes, this release at least makes it appear as if the tables have turned, and Cooper is pursuing Library Tapes' vanishing-point solemnity.<em><br/><br/>Miniatures</em> is so spare, its compositions so quiet and remote, that it has the feel of a demo tape, which it almost is. According to Cooper, he spent a year writing pieces for orchestra and recording discrete melodies for various instruments. During the process, these sketches took on a life of their own, and he decided to re-record them as individual tracks for an album. As such, <em>Miniatures</em> contains standalone works that, as a whole, gesture toward a phantom symphony-- a symphony, one hopes, that Cooper will eventually write. In the meantime, we can glean the tone of the work through these fragments. A plaintive leitmotif that appears in ""Miniature 1"", a burnished dirge for strings and organ, reappears on ""Miniature 3"", a misty rainbow of drones that implies a sweeping horn theme.<br/><br/>Cooper's music as Eluvium is no stranger to musical history. He quotes Philip Glass on <em>Copia</em>'s ""Prelude for Time Feelers"". His yearning piano themes descend from Erik Satie, and they pervade <em>Miniatures </em>in force: See the melting declivities of ""Miniature 2"", the Michael Nyman-esque meditations of ""Miniature 4"", and the off-footed steps of ""Miniature 7"", so tiny you can hear the sheet music turning. Sumptuous Romantic-era strings provide the groundwork for many of his intrepid themes, as on the sublimely simple ""Minature 9"". But Cooper's symphonic ambitions occasionally push him even further back: The honeyed harmonic braid of ""Miniature 5"" is like a Baroque-period organ chorale by Bach, a true album highlight. That this relatively modest piece sounds voluble in the context of the album speaks to how <em>Miniatures</em> muffles Cooper's usual audacity. What it lacks in bravado it makes up for with quiet perseverance and buried coherence. But most importantly, it's just good medicine.</p></div>"|12526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12526-miniatures/|7.2|Brian Howe

Never mind the fact that she is without a doubt female and without a doubt a singer-songwriter, and a ""female singer-songwriter"" in the generic neo-genre sense at that. Not only will no one be fooled by the fake band name, now she's also saddled with a twee moniker that brings to mind children's books and assorted Wes Anderson-isms.</p><p>The name of Gregory and the Hawk's second album, <em>Moenie and Kitchi</em>, adds images of kittens into the mix, or perhaps Japanese cartoon characters. But no need to complicate things with hypotheticals. At heart Gregory and the Hawk is still singer-songwriter Meredith Godreau, and the disc offers things that might be expected of such a title, such as quiet acoustic guitar and earnestly and innocently cooed vocals.</p><p>Yet <em>Moenie and Kitchi</em> does have an x-factor working in its favor, and that's producer and multi-instrumentalist Adam Pierce, of Mice Parade fame. Supposedly, many of Godreau's vocals and guitars were recorded in the same take. If they'd stopped there, the album would be pretty dire indeed. Fortunately, Godreau has no qualms with adorning her skeletal songs with a little meat. The loose drums and buzzing strings of ""Oats We Sow"" gives the otherwise off-the-rack track a slight tinge of unpredictability. A similarly just slightly left-of-center approach helps ""Doubtful"" escape a descent into third-rate Kate Bush, especially when the sub-sonic bass rumbles and amorphous guitar kicks in. ""Ghost"" even comes close to actually rocking, and the horns are a nice touch, too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the songs are awfully ephemeral. Godreau's crystalline voice is remarkable, and it's often mixed high, as if there were any way to miss it. And there's no doubt that she has a way with curiously unresolved melodies. But there's a limitation to her voice all the same, which never wanders too far from the same range or timbre. That leaves a song such as the aptly titled ""Voice Like a Bell"" almost invisibly pretty. It's up to the subtle idiosyncrasies of the production and arrangements-- the swell of ambient noise that ends ""Super Legend"", say, or the percussive electric guitar that propels ""Harmless""-- to coax the disc out of coffee-house purgatory. But it never quite tips the balance.</p></div>"|12529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12529-moenie-and-kitchi/|4.4|Joshua Klein

We've seen this before from Atlanta's Dungeon Family and New Orleans' No Limit Army and Cash Money Millionaires-- fully formed crews that wound up dominating the late-90s commercial rap landscape. Except this time the city is the total rap backwater of Huntsville, Alabama, and the production unit is the Block Beataz, whose bloopy nodded-out synth-boom tracks are way druggier and slower than anything currently on ""106 &amp; Park"". The closest the Paper Route crew have come to impacting mainstream rap was when Rich Boy spit a couple of verses over Jackie Chain and Jhi-Ali's ""Rollin'"" on his <em>Bigger Than the Mayor</em> mixtape. So the Paper Route Gangstaz are something like what the Cash Money Millionaires might've been if they had barely any hope of or interest in actually becoming millionaires.<br/><br/>Even given their nonexistent Q rating, it's a bit weird to see the Paper Route guys hooking up with hipster-DJ kingpins Diplo and Benzi for this mixtape. Even post-""Paper Planes"", these guys don't exactly have a rep for making rap-radio stars, and Paper Route CEO Dawgy Baggz might've wanted to ask some Dipset underling about the long-term loyalty of the clubby hipster crowd. As the rap blogger Noz wrote about this mixtape, the Paper Route guys are, in a way, doing it backwards, reaching for that hipster-kid recognition before they've solidified a serious regional base. And given that the Block Beataz' hallucinatory production is the label's main selling point, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for them to introduce themselves to the world on a mixtape jammed with remixes from Diplo and friends.<br/><br/>But Diplo gets it. His remixes can't quite approximate the Block Beataz' dizzy swell, but they come close. His beats here flutter and breathe, and if he does lean a bit hard on familiar fish-out-of-water samples (Underworld's ""Born Slippy on Blaqstarr's Paper Route collab ""Stuntastic"", for one), he has precedent; the Block Beataz already flipped Weezer's ""Say It Ain't So"" for X.O.'s ""Grind Baby"". And Emnyd's remix of the posse-cut ""Woodgrain"" is just a great track, a cheeseball-house bouncing-ball keyboard drowning in oceans of bass. As dubious as the concept might be, Diplo and his associates stay completely within the Paper Route aesthetic wheelhouse, and their tracks make good introductions to the sound.<br/><br/>But the original Block Beataz tracks are the real reason to seek the tape out. These guys have one basic trick: taking the recent wave of Euro-club silliness that's taken over pop-rap in the past couple of years (think Lil Wayne's ""Lollipop"" or Flo Rida's ""Low"") and slowing it down to the point where these tracks would just never work as ringtones. Their beat for B.O.S.S.'s ""Naturalz Pt. 2"" is a great example: a plinky electric piano slathered with reverb, with haunted synths and trunk-rattle drums layered underneath. Every time another rapper jumps on the track, another element appears: a disco handclap, a jittery hi-hat, a sly little bass riff. And so the track constantly contorts and dissipates and resolves itself; it's damn near spellbinding. Other tracks are just as complicatedly pretty. ""Travelin"" undercuts its mournful R&amp;B vocal and phased-out cowbells with some truly candy quiet-storm keyboard work. The spastic turntable scratches on ""Shotz"" stay deep in the mix, never overwhelming its minimal violin loop. And on ""Grind Baby"", that Weezer sample shares space with a whining G-funk organ and gigantic drums.<br/><br/>For the most part, the rappers on Paper Route are almost beside the point; they're there to sell these beats, nothing more. Thankfully, that's something they know how to do, turning up the intensity when it's warranted and sinking deep into the track the rest of the time. A few voices jump out (Jhi-Ali's marble-mouthed helium squeak in particular), but none dominate. Everyone sticks with tried-and-true Southern-rap topics (sex, drugs, money, cars) and basically stays out of the way. One big exception, though: Jhi-Ali's ""Alabama"", where the Block Beataz give Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" the chipmunk-soul treatment while the rappers give a commendably complicated homestate-pride anthem, Jhi-Ali mentioning lynchings in the same breathe as he points out that <em>Alabama</em> backward sort of almost spells <em>I'm a balla</em>. A few more tracks like that and these guys might not need Diplo's help to break out of Huntsville.</p></div>"|12545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12545-diplo-benzi-present-fear-loathing-in-hunts-vegas/|7.8|Tom Breihan

The sequence, vibrantly scored by hugely successful modern Indian film legend A.R. Rahman, serves as a reminder, as if one was necessary, that what came before it was fantasy.</p><p>Despite attempts to ascribe it sociological significance<em>, Slumdog Millionaire</em> is escapist fare that has little bearing on the complicated and cruel world we live in. Which is not to denigrate the thoroughly entertaining film's value as a movie. Boyle's journeyman tendencies have brought him to some fascinating places, from the surface of the sun in <em>Sunshine</em> to the deserted corridors of zombie-infested England in <em>28 Days Later,</em> and the settings of <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> are no less entrancing, enhanced as usual by Boyle's knack for matching his striking visuals with well-chosen music. <br/><br/>M.I.A. was an obvious pick for this meeting of Boyle's sensibilities and the hardscrabble realities of India's most bustling modern metropolis. It took <em>Pineapple Express</em> to help make M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" an unlikely hit, but that song couldn't be better suited for <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> if Maya Arulpragasam had intentionally composed it for Boyle's use. On screen, the montage-a-rific track (as well as the DFA remix, which is also featured) perfectly complements both the narrative (tenacious street urchins fighting their way out of Mumbai's underclass) and images (heat-soaked slums, trash-strewn streets, and Bombay's vibrant mid-90s rebirth as Mumbai). Needless to say, Rahman couldn't resist roping M.I.A. in once again as a cameo to enhance his cue ""O... Saya.""<br/><br/>With the exception of those tracks and Sonu Nigam's cyber-pop ""Aaj Ki Raat""-- recycled from a Bollywood thriller-- the rest of the <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> soundtrack consists of Rahman's evocative score, which meshes pounding technoid percussive-heavy pieces (such as ""Riots"" or ""Mausam And Escape"") and slightly less forceful cues (such as ""Ringa Ringa""), some of which seem designed to bring to mind specific moments in the film, some to evoke more general emotions. In fact, Rahman has said that one of the instructions given to him by Boyle was to avoid sentiment, and indeed most of the score (save the mawkish and manipulative ballad ""Dreams on Fire"") ebbs and flows free from the usual soaring Hollywood approach. <br/><br/>Some results are deliciously weird, too, such as the stuttering, ""Barber of Seville""-quoting ""Liquid Dance"" or ""Gangsta Blues"", which features Indian MC BlaaZe and sounds a little like an Indian take on Timbaland's take on India. All these tracks are steps along the way to the show-stopping ""Jai Ho"", the film's concluding dance sequence, where Boyle gets to embrace his inner Bollywood and Rahman gets to a compose a track meant to convey little more than pure danceable joy so that the film's stars can get down during the final credits. The sequence marks the film's most triumphant moment and serves a similar purpose punctuating the soundtrack, but having the rest of these tracks in one place serves as a useful reminder of the fast-paced movie's fleeting thrills and vibrant flights of fancy.</p></div>"|12541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12541-slumdog-millionaire-ost/|7.4|Joshua Klein

She's described the clueless or cruel men in her life with such humor and heartbreak that her persona as a harried or wronged woman often seems at odds with her headstrong performances and pointed songwriting. Still, it's odd to think of her recording an album with her husband, odder that such an endeavor wouldn't be contentious, and oddest that her romantic and musical partner would be Wreckless Eric, the Stiff Records artist best known for his sweetly oddball hits ""The Whole Wide World"" and ""Take the Cash (K.A.S.H.)"". The couple made the matter-of-factly titled <em>Wreckless Eric &amp; Amy Rigby</em> at their home in France, performing, recording, and producing everything themselves. Amy gets more songwriting credits, but the music skews toward Eric's fuzzy-edged pop. Taken as a whole, the album sounds surprisingly balanced between the two-- marital give-and-take manifest in music.</p><p>It's not lo-fi (the distortion on ""First Mate Rigby"" comes through clearly), but these songs do sound homemade. That static-riddled spiritedness highlights their individual quirks as well as the easy chemistry between the pair. They trade off vocals and gender roles on ""First Mate Rigby"", chuckle at the vagaries of the music biz on the stand-out ""Round"", and get bitterly wistful on ""Another Drive-In Saturday"". Opener ""Here Comes My Ship"" sets Eric's warbly vocals against what sounds like a keyboard preset beat, then gradually builds to her spoken-word bridge and their casual harmonizing. Eric's simple, curious organ line motors through ""Astrovan"", Amy's surprisingly touching eulogy to a dependable tour van. ""You worked so I could play,"" she sings, before revealing its untimely end: ""They left you across town/ I cried the day you were found.""</p><p>At times that homemade quality gives <em>Eric Rigby</em> a tossed-off feel, as if it's only a rough draft for something more complete. The filter on Amy's vocals makes her sound distant on the waitress' lament ""A Taste of the Keys"", which isn't helped by the lengthy weather forecast sample that begins and ends the song. The album lacks the gravity and cohesion of their best solo material, but not necessarily the humor. Rigby's ""Men in Sandals"" wonders how Hank Williams' music would have sounded if he'd worn Birks instead of boots, then counsels, ""You can't kick ass in Tevas."" Toward the end of the album, ""Please Be Nice to Her"" sounds like a valedictory, a farewell to an old self, and their cover of Johnny Cash's ""I Still Miss Someone"" sounds too harmonious to convey the song's deep, dark yearning. Whether <em>Wreckless Amy</em> represents a one-off collaboration or the start of an ongoing project for both musicians remains to be seen, but they sound pretty happy together.</p></div>"|12532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12532-wreckless-eric-amy-rigby/|6.9|Stephen M.

While the former conquered the magazine covers and fashion runways of America, the latter saw its most visible adherents either fade into oblivion (My Bloody Valentine) or make transitions into Britpop (Ride, Swervedriver) without fully transcending cult status. But then, when you consider what grunge ultimately wrought-- just tune into any modern-rock radio station for the sorry evidence-- it's hard to say it fared any better in the long run. <br/><br/>So you can forgive Atlanta trio All the Saints (never has a ""the"" played such an important distinguishing function in a band's name) for wanting to turn back the clock to 1990, and imagine an alternate history where grunge and shoegazer rock stayed underground, left to fester in a thick psychedelic sludge. But All the Saints are an early-90s-throwback band experimenting with a contemporary business model: their debut album, <em>Fire on Corridor X</em>, was given a wide release last November by Touch &amp; Go in vinyl and mp3 formats only, before the label issued a CD run; however, the album first surfaced in early 2008 through Boston-based indie Killer Pimp, the same imprint that introduced us to A Place to Bury Strangers. Like that band, All the Saints strive for sensory obliteration through effects-pedal abuse, but where APTBS opt for strobe-lit acceleration and car-crash cacophony, All the Saints stew in a slow-motion magma and brace themselves for the inevitable eruptions. <br/><br/><em>Fire on Corridor X </em>is certainly heavy, but it refuses to rock out in the obvious, cathartic sense. The ominously tranquil opening instrumental ""Shadow, Shadow"" and steamrolling surge ""Sheffield"" establish the album's pattern of calm/calamity early on, as bassist Titus Brown and drummer Jim Crook set the patient pace with lumbering, choppy grooves that rarely waver through the course of the album; add guitarist Matt Lambert's distant vocals and vaguely shamanistic proclamations (""give all your problems to me,"" ""do as I say"") and the result is not unlike the heady, early excursions of Smashing Pumpkins or The Verve, minus the latent pop-star aspirations. <br/><br/>What All the Saints lack in rhythmic variation, they make up for with absorbing atmosphere-- their sound truly is subterranean, a dimly lit, cavernous rumble that gets more suffocating as the album progresses. The album's lone folk-song reprieve, ""Leeds"", actually further emphasizes this quality: a sprightly piano-tapped fade-out hints at levity, only for the chords to mutate and melt away just before the fiery title track kicks in. With so much tension and little release, it's no surprise that, despite their shared hometown, All the Saints exist outside of the communal Deerhunter/Black Lips nexus that's come to define contemporary Atlanta indie-rock-- like their grunge-gazer forbears, All the Saints believe misanthropy makes for the best company.</p></div>"|12533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12533-fire-on-corridor-x/|7.0|Stuart Berman

It was at North Carolina's Cat's Cradle, just before one of their many break-ups, in the year 2000. They were touring as a trio (drummer Damon Che, guitarist Ian Williams, and bassist Eric Emm) supporting <em>American Don</em>. I was mesmerized; it seemed impossible that so much sound was coming from three people. Williams and Emm used looping pedals to build swaying house-of-cards melodies. Che's cubist rhythms were utterly enveloping. In the moribund days of Chicago math-rock, Don Cab reviled and revivified the genre at the same time.</p><p>On the other hand, I've all but forgotten the second time I saw Don Cab. It must have been between 2003 and 2006, when Che had reformed the band with all new members. Math-rock was definitively obsolete, and Don Cab could neither escape it nor rejuvenate it. Their careening riffs and multi-jointed meters sounded directionless and uninspired. At the time, I thought maybe I'd changed. Or maybe it was the absence of those lush, swelling loops. All of that was probably true, but their latest album, <em>Punkgasm</em>, makes me think there was more to it.</p><p><em>American Don</em> was so great because it didn't thrive on complexity alone. What awed me about that show, as much as intricacy, was the intense emotion that suffused it. The personal tension between Che and Williams created a sense of massive forces at odds. <em>Punkgasm</em> (which features Che, bassist Jason Jouver, and guitarist Gene Doyle) still bears the group's superficial hallmarks-- virtuosic playing, inventive drumming evocative of jazz, and absurdist songs titles like ""The Irrespective Dick Area"" and ""Why Is the Couch Always Wet?"". Yet it has a hollow ring. Absent the alchemy between Che and his contentious collaborator Williams, <em>Punkgasm </em>sounds like prime Don Cab the way that Nescaf√© tastes like coffee.</p>
<p>A few tracks feature inconsequential vocals from Che and Doyle, and the title track, a punky blast, finds Che on guitar and Doyle on drums. But for the most part, this is an instrumental rock album, and diehard fans of the genre-- people who read gear magazines and have a high regard for technically proficient pastiche-- will find plenty to enjoy. ""Loudest Shop Vac in the World"" seamlessly integrates sections of taut funk, gleaming post-rock, and blistering metal. Unfortunately, metal is Don Cab's least interesting mode, and it threatens to overtake the album entirely. ""Bulk Eye"" starts off promisingly, unfurling a menacing lead, but soon devolves into bludgeoning riffage; many other tracks follow suit.</p>
<p>The frustrating part is that you can hear snatches of inspiration getting swallowed up by the guitar heroics: The chiming home stretch of ""Awe Man That's Jive Skip"" sounds like a bit of Steve Reich dropped into a Slint song, and the languid strains of ""Who's a Puppy Cat"" provide a welcome respite from excessive gnarliness. Even ""Shit Kids Galore"", a deceptively simple one-minute drum solo, is more interesting than fleshed-out songs like ""Pour You Into the Rug"", a squealing anthem that sounds lifted from Tortoise's <em>Standards</em>. People who expect more than expertise and bombast from Don Cab will have to either cling to these moments of idiosyncrasy and vision, or turn back to <em>American Don</em>, when Che had collaborators who exasperated and inspired him in equal measure.</p></div>"|12527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12527-punkgasm/|4.8|Brian Howe

It's impossible to condense every facet of greatness he's been exhibiting since his top-billing debut <em>Ironman</em> into less than 80 minutes, but putting it together in a way that makes it clear how skilled he is as both a lyrically-knotted abstractionist (i.e. <em>Supreme Clientele</em> standout ""Nutmeg"") and a vividly cinematic narrator (<em>Fishscale </em>highlight ""Shakey Dog"") would at least be a fitting synopsis for his prolific career. We got what would've made a good first volume in 2003's <em>Shaolin</em>'<em>s Finest</em>, but there were enough gaps and successive hits-- like the two aforementioned tracks-- to justify a second one.</p><p>And lord knows Ghost's got enough vault material-- mixtape tracks, remixes, rarities, whatever-- to make his studio album discography feel like it's only the surface of his work. The <em>Hidden Darts </em>series and 2008's <em>The Wallabee Champ </em>attest to that, and there's got to be more where those came from. Even with the guest stars and Theodore Unit members and truncated verses, Ghost's cutting-room floor material is typically high-quality enough to carry a pretty worthwhile album on its own.</p><p>But an almost arbitrary-looking and thrown-together mixture of rarities and hits from a man with no shortage of either isn't just something that'll automatically cohere, especially in this single-serving-focused download economy. <em>GhostDeini the Great </em>is stuck halfway between a best-of and a remix collection, and that undercuts the strengths that would've been present in a disc devoted to one format or the other. When only eight of a collection's 16 tracks are devoted to representing an artist's familiar favorites, it turns what would've been a traditional best-of collection's highlights into a series of perfunctory oh-yeah-that moments. When you've got three of <em>Supreme Clientele</em>'s better tracks in close quarters during the middle stretch-- ""Mighty Healthy"", ""Apollo Kids"", and ""Cher Chez La Ghost""-- the only thing that'll probably keep you from switching off <em>GhostDeini </em>and reaching for <em>Clientele</em> is the possibility that ""All That I Got Is You"" will make you reach for <em>Ironman </em>instead.</p>
<p>That problem wouldn't exist if you took the tracklisting and removed all the ""(Remix)"" notations at the end. A best-of that included the aforementioned tracks as well as ""Run"" and ""Kilo"" and ""The Champ"" and ""Back Like That"" would, paired with <em>Shaolin</em>'<em>s Finest</em>, make for a suitable career overview of Ghostface's first 10 years as a marquee solo artist. But the remixes cloud things, and none of them are eclipsing the originals. It makes a hell of a lot of sense to throw Malice from the Clipse onto the remix of ""Kilo"", and even if he's short on his usual wordplay and botches a pop-culture reference pretty egregiously (""we was 300 deep like them <em>Persian </em>soldiers""), his voice sounds like titanium over that beat. But other tracks don't add much of anything, particularly Ice Cube's tossed-off guest spot on ""Be Easy"" (""I'm a killer with the chrome all in your face/ Blow your face back, turn you into a ghost""-- OK, we get it), and Kanye's phoned-in asterisk of a verse on ""Back Like That"". At least those have only one dude sticking their foot in the door; pushing ""Run"" to the six-minute mark with new verses from Raekwon (evocative: ""I won't stop movin' 'til the metal ding me""), Freeway (jokey and hormonally distracted) and Lil' Wayne (sing-songing water-treading verses through a McDonald's drive-thru intercom) turns an agile sprint into a tiring marathon.</p>
<p>There's two all-new tracks, too-- ""Ghostface Xmas"", which provides the bizarre experience of hearing Ghost rap about eggnog and gingerbread men in the same ramped-up, breathless shout he uses for rapping about pushing keys, and the horn-driven, broad-shouldered high-roller CEO playboy swagger of ""Slept on Tony"", which sounds like it could've fit just as well on the soundtrack to <em>Iron Man</em>. Go ahead and cop these on iTunes if you want; they're fun listens. But anyone who buys this without owning <em>Ironman,</em> <em>Supreme Clientele </em>or <em>Fishscale</em><em> </em>is going to miss the bigger picture, and anyone who buys it while already owning those albums isn't gaining much at all.</p></div>"|12540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12540-ghostdeini-the-great/|5.3|Nate Patrin

Though their four studio albums have stuck to revivalist modern rock and ranged from competent to highly enjoyable, BRMC have ran through as many overt, leathery production appliqu√©s (premature JAMC revivalism, ""Tobacco Road"" blooze, combative sophomore slumping) as major label deals, giving credence to the idea that they're more journeymen than firebrands. This sort of context is important in regards to <em>The Effects of 333, </em>which is the kind of uncompromising and severe sonic shift that only works when a band has a lot more to lose, or at the very least an onerous record contract to fulfill. Instead, <em>333 </em>is, no shit, a background noise record released on the band's own label. In the band's own words: ""no apologies, no lyrics, no regrets, just abstract.""¬†And really, no indication that anyone outside of reviewers could be inspired to listen to it multiple times.</p><p><em>333 </em>would be senseless enough were it just typical BRMC songs stripped of vocals, and at least in that form, it could serve as a bizarre curio for their most dedicated fans. There are a pair of tracks-- ""A Twisted State"" or ""And With This Comes""-- that sound like standard BRMC. On those tracks, reverbed guitars howl while lonesome acoustics strum inside the margin; it sounds pleasant enough to score the ruminative point on MTV's ""Made""<em> </em>where the subject questions her commitment to cheerleading camp. Now imagine that going on for almost five minutes at a time with no real melodic vehicle or dynamics, and you're in touch with the unfathomable context in which these are the high points.¬†</p><p><em>333 </em>often sounds like a guitar band clumsily trying to recreate Fennesz. Forget <em>Black Sea</em>: Most of the music here is along the lines of the Dead Sea minus the depth-- a salty and motionless murk.<em> </em>Occasionally, a potentially intriguing touch filters in, such as the cicada-like chirps of ""A Sad State"" or the coruscated feedback swells that punctuate ""Still No Answer"". But they never become much more than touches tacked onto seemingly endless bouts of detuned guitar roughage. Even the most stubbornly motivated headphones listen reveals little in the way of layering or detail that might suggest how this could possibly manage to be three years in the making. One saving grace: This is almost certainly a one-off rather than a new direction.</p>
<p>Too loud to be ambient; too polished to work in the realm of noise, the cruelest confirmation of <em>The Effects of 333's </em>failure to be a defiantly alienating trainwreck<em> </em>is that it's hardly unlistenable. Unlike previous 00s low points like <em>Liz Phair </em>and <em>Travistan, 333</em> isn't a new direction. Hell, it's even conceivably <em>admirable </em>considering how electronic music that's more ambient than song-oriented is still somewhat off limits for rock bands, particularly ones with the commercial ambitions of BRMC. But the full-fledged commitment of <em>333 </em>instead exposes a band way over its head, overcompensating for an inability to integrate fresh ideas into a framework that, from the sounds of <em>Baby 81</em>, needed them in the worst way. Quite a year we're already having here-- while it'll be surprising if we get a better record than <em>Merriweather Post Pavilion </em>in 2009, the odds are even longer that we'll see one as utterly pointless as the insanely inessential <em>The Effects of 333.</em></p></div>"|12544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12544-the-effects-of-333/|0.4|Ian Cohen

But this characterization misses the point, because Redding's music-- in its constantly evolving urgency, abandon, and complexity-- invites even the casual listener to become obsessive. To listen to his live performances is to give in to the urge to compare them, argue over them, parse their differences. <br/><br/>One of the most dynamic singers ever to put his stamp on the pop charts, Redding consistently emphasized song over performance, which means each take is singular and unrepeatable.<em> Live in London and Paris</em> features especially remarkable stagings from the Stax Records' infamous 1967 European package tour, and captures Redding at the full height of his powers as a showman. So what if the two strong live albums still in print-- 67's <em>Live in Europe</em>, which overlaps with <em>London and Paris</em>, and 68's <em>In Person at the Whisky a Go Go</em>-- render this new collection essentially inessential? Redding's superlative stage presence ought to appeal to all listeners, whether they've studiously researched the making of <em>Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul</em> or just groove to ""(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay"" whenever it's on the oldies station. Regardless of the repetitive nature of <em>Live in London and Paris</em>-- in fact, <em>because</em> of it-- leaning close to listen for each staging's distinctive qualities can be a rewarding experience.<br/><br/><strong>Introductions</strong><br/>At London's Finsbury Park Astoria and four days later at the Olympia Theatre in Paris, Emperor Rosko rouses the crowd by having them spell out Redding's name. One English fan, sitting suspiciously close to Tom Dowd's recording equipment, can be heard screaming out the letters of Doris Troy's name; Roger Armstrong's liner notes suggest it signals his disapproval of this new wave of R&amp;B that Redding represents. The French are far better spellers, and Rosko declares them ""groovy, baby, groovy."" Both intros seem like relics of the period, but they show just how well his music has aged. There is no dust on these songs. <br/><br/><strong>""Respect""</strong><br/>Redding had some spelling of his own to do on this tour, namely R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Better known today as a hit for Aretha Franklin, his ""Respect"" makes an especially apt opener, its urgent tempo and pleading lyrics riling up the crowd. In London, the song sounds reckless as Redding leads the band at double time. In fact, ""Respect"" almost gets away from him: Halfway through he botches a cue but quickly recovers. The Paris performance dials the tempo down a bit, amps up the Mar-Keys' horns, and spotlights Donald ""Duck"" Dunn's elastic bassline.<br/><br/><strong>""My Girl""</strong><br/>Redding's first European hit was his cover of the Temptations' chart smash ""My Girl"". In both venues the song retains its famous three-note bass theme and loping tempo, but the M.G.s transfer that bassline to Steve Cropper's guitar, which adds a lush backdrop for Redding's earthy vocals. In Paris, where ""My Girl"" was Redding's fourth song of the night instead of his second, Cropper and Dunn double up on that ascending melody so that it provides a more emphatic commentary on Redding's delivery. Here the differences in the technical recordings become clear: The London show fuzzes around the edges, whereas the Paris set sounds much crisper-- you can hear every thrum of Booker T.'s organ and every click of Al Jackson, Sr.'s drumstick against the snare rim.<br/><br/><strong>""Shake""</strong><br/>In both shows, ""My Girl"" leads abruptly into the faster ""Shake"", originally by Sam Cooke but also covered on <em>Otis Blue</em>. The band knows how well the transition works: Those horn blasts, punctuated by Cropper's guitar, herald a new song at a new tempo, leaving the audience with barely enough time to catch their breaths. In London, it's the band's finest, tightest moment, as every instrument-- even the audience's clapping and shouts-- clicks into place to emphasize that jumpy groove. In Paris, it's even better, with Jackson's drum fills rolling in and out of the chorus and Redding involving the audience even more: <br/><br/>""Say it with a little bit of soul!""<br/><br/>""Shake!""<br/><br/>""Say it with a little bit of feeling!""<br/><br/>""Shake!""<br/><br/><strong>""Day Tripper""</strong><br/>In London ""Shake"" is followed by ""Day Tripper"", an effective one-two punch. Redding's cover essentially finishes what the Beatles started: It syncopates the rhythms, revs up the tempo, and trips out the melody, making the original sound like a rough sketch. In Paris, however, Redding and the band move ""Day Tripper"" to near the end of the show so that it leads into closer ""Try a Little Tenderness"". Booker T.'s organ is an airplane landing, the Mar-Keys' horn stabs sound like sparks of fire, and Redding elaborates on the lyrics, picking a phrase and repeating it demonstratively: ""Gottagottagottagottagotta! You gotta love me when I want it, baby!""<br/><br/><strong>""Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)""</strong><br/>""Here's a song I love to sing, and I want you to help me sing it along together,"" Redding says in London by means of introducing ""Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)"", and despite its mournful horn preface, it's not really a sad song, but rather a song about sad songs. He actually has to teach the London audience how to do a call and response, drawing them out a bit to sing ""Sock it to me, baby!"" and ""Wang dang doodle"" back to him. In Paris, the crowd sings and claps along with no prompting, and that, more than Redding's insistent performance, puts the song over.<br/><br/><strong>""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction""</strong><br/>Of course the London crowd goes nuts for this one. The Rolling Stones were hometown boys, and Redding had covered that group's signature hit on <em>Otis Blue</em>, which was his first hit album in England. Jackson's drums give the song its headlong momentum, and the band breaks it down for Redding to explore the improvisational potential of the syllables ""-faction."" Even though it comes earlier in the Paris show, Redding still sounds like he's feeding off the French audience's enthusiasm, throwing himself into the song completely. It's one of his most commanding performances on this disc, although the longer version from <em>In Person at the Whisky a Go Go</em> proves superior, if only for the call and response with the band and the quickening tempo on the climax.<br/><br/><strong>""Try a Little Tenderness""</strong><br/>More than any other pair of tracks, these two versions of ""Try a Little Tenderness""-- closing both shows-- sound more or less identical, right down to Emperor Rosko calling Redding out for multiple encores. The big push on the London performance sounds a bit shaky, but the band clicks into place soon enough. In Paris, it's simply more efficient, and his encores-- repeating that final push-- are messy but genuinely moving. <br/><br/>That leaves three tracks from Paris that weren't played in London, where a curfew ensured a shorter show: ""I Can't Turn You Loose"" maintains the energy and pace of ""Respect"" and includes the album's best breakdown; ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"" finds an ideal balance between gruff and tender; and later in the show, ""These Arms of Mine"" sounds as if Redding were writing the song as he goes. The inclusion of these tracks not only emphasizes the ebb and flow between fast and slow songs, with the intensity never waning, but also suggests that the Paris show could have been released on its own. That would have made a stronger, if shorter, release, rather than a minor reissue from a major artist. But if you've read this far, you probably ought to pick it up anyway.</p></div>"|12531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12531-live-in-london-and-paris/|8.0|Stephen M. Deusner

It's her strongest effort yet, a mini-manifesto on how to weld varied American sounds together and also fucking rock at the same time. This is the record to buy for your dad for his birthday, and then burn for yourself afterwards (hey, he already likes Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson).</p><p>The 32-year-old Holland has worked very hard to get here. She's been <em>this close </em>to the cohesive greatness on display here a number of times. She helped to form the Be Good Tanyas a decade or so ago but left once it became clear that they had a more narrow (and more treacly) idea of what folk music is, just as they started to hit the top of the middle of the road. Holland's 2003 debut <em>Catalpa</em>, initially self-released and later put out on Anti-, had a pleasant living room aura and 27 years of great songs; it's easily among the best folk records of the last decade. Her two subsequent albums simultaneously embraced and rejected the idea of ""folk,"" with varying results. <em>Escondida</em>, from 2004, had great songs and excellent players, but the arrangements were self-consciously old-timey, veering a touch too close to jazz-folk hokum. And on 2006's <em>Springtime Can Kill You</em>, it felt like there were too many ideas competing with each other.</p><p>Thanks in part to the able production work of Shahzad Ismaily, the problems of the past two records are a distant memory. There's a cohesiveness to this record that's stunning when one considers just how eclectic it is. ""Love Henry"" combines gently plucked trad guitar styles, slightly out-there guitar playing, and what's either a whistle or a singing saw, together with a dash of ethereal ambient <em>whatsis</em> behind a doubled vocal that intentionally sounds like it's coming from a big standalone tube radio. To do that shit in 2008 and not sound pretentious and cloying and ""now playing at Starbucks"" is a small miracle. The swamp cooler ""Fox in Its Hole"" has elements that might remind the listener of Tom Waits circa <em>Swordfishtrombones</em>, but this is only apparent if you think too much about it. M. Ward plays guitar on a few songs, alongside Holland herself and the ever-able Marc Ribot.</p>
<p>In ""Mexico City"" Holland intones, ""I think about you Jack, watching the TV and drinking booze, shame on you."" I imagine she's singing to Jack Kerouac, who published the book-length poem <em>Mexico City Blue</em>s in 1959. If so, Holland should cut this sort of thing out. She's always spoken to ghosts in her music-- or at least says nice things about them. One of her best songs namechecks Isabelle Eberhardt and William S. Burroughs, while on another she sings ""nobody plays guitar like Blind Willie McTell."" Such dues-paying and earnest homage-making is charming from a brand-new artist and judicious from an elder one. But for an artist in the midst of her career, it feels a bit like a crutch.</p>
<p>Still, a few poorly chosen lyrics aren't much to complain about. I keep coming back to Holland's Texas phrasing, in which she stretches out the simplest words into more syllables than there are in the ingredients listed on the side of a soda can. And as appealing as that can sound, Holland only sings like that when the material calls for it. She's never been as in control of her voice, an incredible instrument that is as strong as it is attractive. And on <em>The Living and the Dead</em>, it's found just the right setting.</p></div>"|12528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12528-the-living-and-the-dead/|7.8|Mike McGonigal

""You asked me why all these years, all these years I've held everything from you,"" he sings over a slicing acoustic guitar line and quiet bursts of staticky snare rolls. That line is crucial: A graphic designer pursuing a graduate degree, the Rochester native has been writing songs all of his life. But due to what his real artist bio describes as a ""harrowing performance of <em>Phantom of the Opera</em> at a school assembly"" (I submit that all such performances are harrowing), he has been reluctant to release his work, much less publicize it. Aside from a handful of tracks here and there within the past year or so (including one on <em>Help Me to Sing</em>, which accompanied the soundtrack to <em>Awake, My Soul: The Story of the Sacred Harp</em>), the <em>Curtain Speech</em> EP is his first real release, serving as both a preview of his 2009 full-length and his first opportunity to make a real statement. He doesn't waste time: ""Around the Lion Legs"" crescendos to a swooning finale, on which he and a choir sing ""These things cannot be taken back/ I know know."" Stith doesn't just release material, the song suggests. He relinquishes it. That Sufjan Stevens and My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden both sing back-up only hammers that point home.</p><p>Suf and Shara are there for a couple of reasons: First, they're his labelmates at Asthmatic Kitty, and second, he played on past My Brightest Diamond albums and even contributed to the packaging design. The string quartet Osso, also new to Asthmatic Kitty, appears on one track, and Rafter plays bass and cymbals. Perhaps not entirely comfortable with this endeavor, Stith gets by with a little help from his friends. If he's worried about issues of ownership, authorial intent, and mass production, I can't really help him there. But if it's a simple case of stage fright, he should relax a bit. <em>Curtain Speech</em> reveals a new artist with an already highly developed compositional and vocal style. His songs move organically and patiently, building in unexpected-- but in retrospect, inevitable-- directions, and he carefully molds his vocals into arcs, hiccups, sighs, and coos, which individually have as much impact as his words.</p><p>Even so, <em>Curtain Speech</em> makes clear that his approach demands a longer form than the EP. Of the five songs here, two are atmosphere-establishing instrumentals, one is a short vocal doodle, and only two feel fully fleshed out. Stith plays piano on the instrumental title track, banging out a single chord with varying tempo and recalling Philip Glass in the process. As an interstitial on a longer player, the ethereal, wordless harmonies might add more to the overall ambience, but on an EP, the song is a wobbly support pole. ""Hoarse Sorrows and the Whole Blind Earth..."" is likewise lyric-less, but its instrumentation proves as grandiose as its ridiculous title, barely redeemed by its whistled melody.</p>
<p>""Around the Lion Legs"" and ""Just Once"" sound much more purposeful, and not merely because they are anchored to words. The former is the stand-out track here, Stith at his most musically assertive and lyrically self-questioning, and ""Just Once"" is, well, a bit exasperating. This seven-minute centerpiece begins quietly, with Osso plucking out a subdued theme and Stith singing softly, as if to make you lean in to hear. The tempo remains steady, collecting instruments in its flow: handclaps, bowed strings, insectoid buzzing, curlicues of clarinet. Midway though, however, the song explodes into a loud second act that doesn't expand on this subdued palette of sounds, but simply amplifies them. Garish and unnecessary, this section leavens rather than intensifies the song's careful unease. <em>Curtain Speech</em> ends with ""Abraham's Song (Firebird)"", the collection's sparsest track. It's just Stith and an acoustic guitar, but it concisely demonstrates the moodiness of his vocals and the fluidity of his melodies. This EP may stumble, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do: It makes you want to hear even more from this curious talent.</p></div>"|12536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12536-curtain-speech-ep/|6.6|Stephen M.

No one who's been looking forward to it should be disappointed. Everything that's defined the band to this point-- all those strands winding through their hugely diverse catalog-- is refined and amplified here.</p>
<p>Since their inception, Animal Collective have wandered the territorial edges of music, scoping out where boundaries had been erected and looking beyond them. They've punctuated perfectly likeable indie rock songs with bleating vocalizations. They've seeded pretty instrumentals with irritating noise. They've juxtaposed West African rhythms and melodies cribbed from British folk. They've stayed on a single chord for 10 minutes. But <i>Merriweather</i> feels like a joyous meeting in a well-earned, middle place-- the result of all their explorations pieced together to create something accessible and complete.</p>
<p>Although it will be tagged as Animal Collective's ""pop"" album, <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i> remains drenched in their idiosyncratic sound, a record that no one else could have made. The album is named for a Maryland venue that last year played host to Santana, Sheryl Crow, and John Mayer, but its songs won't be heard on the radio, and besides, Animal Collective's M.O. requires them to exist outside of rigid formats. Nonetheless, they've found a natural way to integrate the sing-along melodies, sticky hooks, and driving percussion that have long been hallmarks of celebratory popular music.</p>
<p>Animal Collective's two vocalists, Dave Portner (aka Avey Tare) and Noah Lennox (aka Panda Bear), have never sounded better together, and the way their styles complement each other is the story of the album. On the one hand you have Panda's straightforward melodies, his fuzzy, head-in-the-clouds dreaminess, and his instinctual trawl through pop music history. The tracks that favor his songwriting typically have an underlying sense of drone, with everything moving forward along a line in relation to some subliminal center: They begin, then build, expand, and contract. Tare, meanwhile, tends to work within a more classic pop structure, with clear bridges and snappy choruses, greater harmonic development, and a sharper lyrical focus. Here, he reins in the blurting vocalizations that he's so often used as punctuation (the hardcore faithful might miss this unhinged emoting just a little). Both songwriters are on exactly the same page and, working with sonic spelunker Brian ""Geologist"" Weitz and producer Ben Allen (no Josh ""Deakin"" Dibb this time), they've found a sumptuous musical background for their most accomplished songs.</p>
<p><i>Merriweather</i> is the kind of album on which any song could be someone's favorite, but two will likely reign as the choice picks: ""My Girls"" and ""Brother Sport"", both of which leaked prior to the record's release, contain the album's most effervescent moments, drawing from the communal energy of the group's astonishing live show. ""My Girls"" grows from a synth-speckled, half-speed intro into a booming electro-pop burner with handclaps and deep bass-- a towering edifice of sound trailed by long wisps of West coast harmonies. The Afro-Brazilian-flavored ""Brother Sport"" moves from one chanted melodic nugget to the next before building to a huge swirl of psychedelic sound that encompasses rave sirens and immersive tribal drums.</p>
<p>But these obvious peaks would have less resonance if not for the more subtle moments. The oblong architecture of ""Daily Routine"" hearkens back to the band's less stable earlier days, as it moves appealingly from an awkward organ-based mid-tempo  number to a long, droney coda that has the ego-pulverizing bliss of shoegaze. The surging thrust of distortion and drumkick that propels ""Summertime Clothes"" starts with an almost militaristic pomp, but the song soon reaches a place of pure sweetness with a simple chorus hook (""I want to walk around with you"") that could have come from any point in the last 100 years. Similarly out-of-time sentiments mark ""Bluish""-- lines like ""I'm getting lost in your curls,"" or, ""Some kind of magic in the way you're lying there""-- and the music has the airy ease of 1970s soft-rock that weirdly winds up a little disconcerting. And then ""Also Frightened"" has the dislocated swoon of first-wave psychedelia, a ""See Emily Play""-style mediation on the small insanity of childhood softened with billowing layers of voices.</p>
<p>The lyrics focus on the body, basic human connection, the need to take care of oneself, the puzzle of existence. Where the churning electronic sound, with its fizzes and echoes and underwater cast, brings to mind altered states and the confusing gap between the familiar and the strange, the words seem like a running commentary on the essential mystery of being alive. Animal Collective don't tell stories, and their music rarely has characters; there's little clever wordplay and fewer money lines you'll repeat later on. Rather, the words reinforce the sense of vulnerability that cuts through the music, and wind up being an essential component on an album that oozes confidence from every pore.</p>
<p>Music obsessives talk a lot about originality-- whether it's important, or why having a new sound should or shouldn't matter. In recent years, some fantastic albums have turned a number of people off for being retreads, which has sparked some interesting discussions. This album, which finds Animal Collective completely owning their unique sound, feels like the crucial next step in that conversation. What they've constructed here is a new kind of electronic pop-- one which is machine-generated and revels in technology but is also deeply human, never drawing too much attention to its digital nature. It's of the moment and feels new, but it's also striking in its immediacy and comes across as friendly and welcoming. Animal Collective have spent the decade following their own path, figuring out what their music is capable of while also working to bring more listeners into their world. On <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>, their commitment has paid off tremendously.</p></div>"|12518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/|9.6|Mark Richardson

The hottest producer in Britain (Trevor Horn) starts his own record label and recruits an <em>NME</em> writer (Paul Morley) as ideologue and ideas man. Backed up with engineering skills and business savvy, the fledgling label proceeds to score two of the biggest UK hits of the 1980s with Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""Relax"" and ""Two Tribes"". Thanks to Horn's thunderously clean hi-NRG production, Morley's skill at marketing and conceptualization, and the sleazy charisma of Frankie singer Holly Johnson, these were monumental records: singles as high-impact media events. Leading off this 25th anniversary record label retrospective, they still sound brilliant today.<br/><br/>Frankie's awesome bluster, however, wasn't typical of what early ZTT records were trying to achieve. The label's aesthetic was at its most striking and successful when fusing the art theory of early 20th century Europe with the drive and gloss of mechanized 80s pop. They incorporated Dada, Futurism, expressionist cinema, and chanson into pop gestures in ways that felt dynamic, even natural. As Morley-- initially given free rein to shape the label's image-- wrote, ""Can you imagine what the Futurists would have done with a Fairlight [synthesiszer]?"" That was the ZTT idea in a nutshell. The band Propaganda, and Horn's own group Art of Noise, were its fullest expressions. Art of Noise made jokey, jerky pop <em>concr√®te</em> and found themselves adored by American electro pioneers. Propaganda made forbiddingly expensive synth-pop: their outrageously dramatic ""Dr Mabuse"" is the ultimate example of the ZTT sound. Both groups are well represented here.<br/><br/>Morley's impact on ZTT peaked in 1985 with the release of Frankie's first album, and by 1988 he had mostly severed his ties with the label. Dividing ZTT's history into the Morley and post-Morley era might seem like playing along with the writer's own conceits, but the rapid decline in quality of the music on this box set backs it up. With the exception of 808 State-- whose 1989 ""Pacific"" was the last important single the label released-- little of the post-Morley material here is memorable. Morley's gradual estrangement from ZTT was more a symptom of its shifting priorities than a cause, but even so there's a spark of absurd inspiration that left with him. This isn't to say the youthful label had been infallible-- you might admire their cheek, but that won't make you sit through the truly execrable Das Psych-Oh! Rangers more than once. (Sigue Sigue Sputnik stole all their ideas, claims the lavish accompanying booklet rather desperately).<br/><br/>On this evidence ZTT in the 90s and 00s has been paying a 20-year penance for its brief incarnation as Britain's most interesting record label. Discs Two and Three showcase its remarkable ability to observe a trend and sign its least intriguing exponents: There are few more workmanlike guitar bands than Ireland's the Frames or ignorably competent rave crews than Shades of Rhythm. The set suggests there aren't many undiscovered gems in the ZTT vault: Instead it offers a kind of alternate history of British rock and dance, one told in a dull monotone and with all the good bits stripped out. ZTT's newest hitmaker, David Jordan, makes a lumpy blend of world-pop in search of an opening ceremony to call its own. The idiotic campfire stomp of his ""Sun Goes Down"" is several sensibilities away from the sharpness and ambition of a Propaganda. The box set's audio component ends with Seal, ZTT's most successful post-Frankie project, whose songs show that Trevor Horn can still do sumptuous, even when there are no ideas to animate the work.<br/><br/>For unheralded delights in the <em>ZTT Box Set</em> you have to stick to the first disc, or the fourth, a DVD of the label's best videos. Early signings like chanteuse Anne Pigalle and minimalist composer Andrew Poppy make more sense on screen, and it's amusing seeing Johnny Depp act a barfly in a Shane McGowan promo. Best of all is the Art of Noise's hilarious and terrifying video for ""Close (To the Edit)""-- band members smash the bourgeois instruments of the classical past while a freakish child mimes in cut-up motion to their Fairlight-driven future. Back on the first CD, familiar hits rub shoulders with MC Tunes vs. 808 State's ""Tunes Splits the Atom""-- a Brit-rap brag rolling on a well-picked Stone Roses sample-- and Act's ""Snobbery and Decay"".<br/><br/>A collaboration between Propaganda's Claudia Br√ºcken and synth-pop pioneer Thomas Leer, Act did nothing commercially, but this swirling, magnificently overripe single was the last lost masterpiece of the label's glory years. Br√ºcken's haughty cabaret delivery revels in the decadence of wealth even as she sings its downfall-- ""Property, poverty, an unstable economy-- in decay!"" Like Zang Tumb Tuum itself, ""Snobbery and Decay"" was ambitious and ridiculous, grand and pretentious in equal measure: It was to be the last release in the label's Action Series, its opening salvo of pop records that had included Frankie and the Art of Noise. ZTT could not have asked for a finer farewell: Such a pity that it wasn't one.</p></div>"|12519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12519-zang-tumb-tuum-the-ztt-box-set/|5.1|Tom Ewing

Although their self-titled debut has the immediacy and hard hooks that riddle so much of this genre, Friendly Fires show an amplified, ambitious, and inventive attention to detail that helps steer them away from sounding like just another polished party band.<br/><br/>That said, the most striking characteristic of <em>Friendly Fires</em> is that every track sounds like an indie club hit. This energy is relentless to a comical degree, and ends up being the group's Achilles' heel. ""Jump in the Pool"" opens with heavily produced vocal layering that brings to mind 10cc's ""I'm Not in Love""; the subtle vocal additions courtesy of lead singer Ed Macfarlane match the lush wall of guitars and Duran Duran-style wood-block-and-cowbell percussion. Never content to stick to the rails of an already memorable vocal melody, Macfarlane has a tendency to overdub in every direction, brilliantly emphasizing the word ""pool"" so it sounds like a clipped beat, and allowing an equally strong falsetto line to scorch through the spaces between.<br/><br/>""Paris"", with backing vocals from Au Revoir Simone, is similarly effect-laden, culminating in washes of renaissance cathedral reverb. Like many of their peers, Friendly Fires nod frequently to the 1980s, particularly on ""Strobe"", at the center of which Edd Gibson provides a gorgeous reversed guitar loop, and ""White Diamonds"", which sounds like early Cure mixed with ""Strangelove""-era Depeche Mode. The bass lines continually stick to classic, bouncy disco octaves that keep the dance vibe set at full speed ahead, and Friendly Fires pull off every move with considerable finesse, preserving all the euphoric dynamism of their powerful live shows.<br/><br/>Friendly Fires are the infallible kings of the melodic reprise, and almost every track features two choruses. Rather than sounding like a dull muddle, however, the songs are so carefully arranged that everything keeps your attention. The band recorded the entire album in the garage of Macfarlane's parents' house, laying down tracks on a laptop using ""a crappy microphone gaffer taped to a mic stand,"" but without top-notch mixing drafted in from a variety of sources, <em>Friendly Fires</em> would sound like a completely different record. As it is,<em> Friendly Fires</em> is teeming with ideas, and although the record's consistent sound can be exhausting-- there is no release, no relaxation in tempo-- it's encouraging to locate a new band with too much passion, so much that it can hardly execute its ideas on one page.</p></div>"|12511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12511-friendly-fires/|7.9|Mia Clarke

When the Betas split in 2004, three of its original members-- keyboardist John MacLean, drummer Robin Jones, and guitarist Gordon Anderson (who had recorded solo as Lone Pigeon)-- decided they still had some creating to do together, and forged the Aliens. The new band, which released its debut album, <em>Astronomy for Dogs</em>, in 2007, like their former band, veers between experimentalism and pop songcraft. <em>Luna</em>, their sophomore effort, is cut from the same cloth.<br/><br/>At their best, the Aliens are clever composers, tuneful harmonists, and positioned in shallow leftfield. At their worst, they cry out for an editor and wander the outfield when they should be keeping their eye on the ball. Clocking in at over an hour, <em>Luna</em> probably would've been best served by a trim to around 45 minutes. Two songs break the 10-minute mark, and neither justifies it. Opener ""Bobby's Song"" gets good mileage in its midsection from playing with the speed and pitch of the vocal track, but the song takes it too far during a tiresome slowdown near the end. Still, there's a good song swimming in the psychedelic soup, and it pops up in the imaginative harmonica intro and the verses.<br/><br/>The other epic, ""Billy Jack"", is as unfocused as the movie it's named for. It opens with over a minute of vocals trying to find their way out of a processing morass while keyboards noodle, before finally arriving at a drifting verse that's overpopulated with noise. The song keeps finding its footing, and each time piles on too much reverb and distortion and loses it. They seem to have imagined it as some sort of psychedelic glam epic, but it only becomes that more than six minutes in. In contrast, ""Everyone"" is a great four-minute slice of sunshine pop-psych, with buoyant piano and harmonies.<br/><br/>Other missteps include the awkward way ""Sunlamp Show"" suddenly and sloppily shifts rhythms mid-way through, the three spaced-out electronic interludes where one would suffice, or the repetitive and amelodic ""Magic Man"".¬† On the whole, these songs overshadow the loveliness of the sparse ballad ""Theremin"" and the diaphanous closer ""Blue Mantle."" But it's ""Boats"", a sort of self-cover of a Lone Pigeon song from 2004's <em>Schoozzzmmii</em>, that does the most to redeem the record with its spectral harmonies and spacious arrangement, which gives the impression of traveling through a galaxy as starbursts of piano drift by. <em>Luna</em> is enjoyable enough to listen to, and a lot of Beta Band followers will find plenty to enjoy here, but it's ultimately an album I didn't like as much as I wanted to, and one that doesn't really find its footing until it's almost over.</p></div>"|12514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12514-luna/|5.6|Joe Tangari

These records can be counted on for a handful of dozens-packing laugh riots, a handful of moderately inspired club tracks, a handful of handouts to less talented associates, and at least one song everyone can agree is just god-awful. This sort of consistent inconsistency has been good to Chris Bridges (""I was set for <em>life </em>after three LPs""), but he's called <em>Theater of the Mind </em>his ""classic"" album, which would probably raise a few more eyebrows had he not said the same exact thing about 2006's <em>Release Therapy.</em></p><p>But while <em>Release Therapy </em>sought to prove (in a relative sense) that Ludacris had important opinions about things other than pussy poppin' on the handstand, <em>Theater </em>is every bit as serious-minded in a different fashion. Forget gunning for the #1 spot over <em>Austin Powers</em> instrumentals, Ludacris is gunning for those nebulous ""top five, dead or alive"" props. It's not all that far-fetched considering the ""lyricist"" moments of <em>The Preview</em>, last year's mixtape with DJ Drama and the one boast he used twice by his second album-- ""My rap career goes back further than your father's hairline."" But the main problem stems from a boast on the intro-- ""Give me 16 bars on another nigga's song and I'MMA FUCKIN' KILL IT."" True enough, but give him 50 minutes of passable beats on his own album, and he might kill it, like, 45-55% of the time.</p><p>As to be expected from someone who spends a lot of time with questionable screenplays, <em>Theater of the Mind</em> somewhat unintentionally breaks up into three distinct acts. But it flows less in a ""cinematic"" manner and more like <em>Nick at Nite of the Mind</em>-- going from slapstick single-cam, drippy rom-com, and the self-serious drama to close things out. Obviously, it leads to a constantly jarring listen, though the first third does provide its share of high points. ""Undisputed"" takes the concept of Ghostface's ""The Champ"" full stop, and perhaps in a show of Def Jam's priorities, he gets Floyd Mayweather as his trainer rather than a non-licensed <em>Rocky </em>rip. We'd need a bunch of footnotes to keep track of the quotables (""Your style isn't favored/ And DJ's NEVER bring it back/ Like when you borrow from your neighbor!"" or ""If you're sittin' on chrome/ I'll call my boys and you'll get stripped of your medals like Marion Jones!""). And while ""Wish You Would"" doesn't match the triumph of <em>Paper Trail's </em>hatchet-burying ""On Top of the World"", it's still potent shit talk.</p>
<p>But where the first act shows, the final tells, as Luda goes through a pro forma checklist of Things Real MC's Do-- collaborating with Lil Wayne, ""The first southern rapper on a Primo beat,"" the Nas/Jay-Z number, and the ""conscious"" closer that features ""Spizzike"" Lee and Common (wait, what?). Each is pretty enjoyable if you can ignore the gaping leaps of logic. Ludacris claims ""I Do It for Hip Hop"" (not the fancy chains, etc.), about 20 minutes after boasting ""I'm about my money if it kills me"" and spends an entire verse advocating riding dirty because it makes his car resemble uniforms of shitty NBA franchises. He claims that, as a lyricist, he's the ""Last of a Dying Breed"" about 20 minutes after T-Pain shows up to advocate fucking fat chicks (""One More Drink""). And at long last, he pleads with the young black youth to git up, git out, and get something 20 minutes after making a track called ""Southern Gangsta"" where Rick Ross murders him on his own ignorant shit by misquoting ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"" and boasting about his ""Jewish friends"" and the ""newest Benz.""</p>
<p>While <em>Theater </em>isn't quite as dire as the above may indicate, like every other Ludacris record, it doesn't grow on you-- in fact, it actually contracts. In the middle, most tracks are rendered with a <em>Friends</em>-like one dimensionality (""the one about..."") that makes it perfectly clear from the first minute whether you'll ever want to listen to it again. The only multi-faceted concept is ""Call Up the Homies"", which is both a cross-country playdate where the Game and Ludacris meet up to shoot people while showing absolutely zero chemistry as well as a showcase for Phoenix's thoroughly uninspiring Willy Northpole. ""What Them Girls Like"" goes one title, and apparently it's chirpy rap and bullshit with Chris Brown and text messages from Plies. ""Nasty Girl"" is something of a ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" framework around his ""lady in the street/ But a freak in the bed"" line from ""Yeah!"", and a woefully undeveloped one at that. Like a Jewish mother, Ludacris can't think of any respectable professions besides doctors and lawyers. And these are his ideas of potential hits, bringing up an even more serious worry than him never completing a true ""classic"": he might not even be capable of a ""Get Back"" or ""Act a Fool"" anymore either.</p></div>"|12517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12517-theater-of-the-mind/|5.3|Ian Cohen

The film essentially encompasses everything Wayne Coyne has ever sung about-- the future, outer space, stressed-out scientists, heroism, insanity, the inevitability of death, hope in the face of disaster, the perseverance of the human spirit, mankind's miniscule standing in the universe at large, and, yes, Christmas. And as ridiculous as the idea of Coyne making a sci-fi film in his backyard may be, it was a logical step for a band that's historically found its stage-show inspiration in the local hardware store. But compared to the orgiastic circus of balloons, confetti, and dancing mascots that has come to define the the Flaming Lips' live set-up, <em>Christmas on Mars</em> is a starkly rendered, sometimes ponderous, rather bleak affair. Starring multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd as a Mars-station major trying to salvage Christmas celebrations on the red planet after a Santa-suited colleague's suicide, and Coyne as the mute alien who helps him, the film plays like a <em>2001</em> that looks like it cost $2,001 to make. <br/><br/>Its accompanying score likewise marks a break from the Lips' post-millennial recorded output, which, consistent with the band's live evolution, has emphasized the band's cute and quirky qualities while submerging the strange. And yet, even with the complete absence of the band's signature devices-- namely, Coyne's creaky croon and Drozd's earth-quaking drum beats-- <em>Christmas on Mars</em> still feels very much like a Flaming Lips album, fusing synthetic orchestral elements, choral harmonies and electronic effects to create a soundtrack that, like the film, captures both what we imagine outer space to be (a wondrous expanse of psychedelic splendor) and what it really is: a cold, dark, desolate place that's so vast, it's suffocating. Not for nothing is the soundtrack book-ended by an eerily Lynchian ambient piece called ""Once Beyond Hopelessness"".<br/><br/>Given that the film's production began in 2001, it would follow that the score's origins date back to that post-<em>Soft Bulletin</em>/pre-<em>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</em> era. In a sense, <em>Christmas on Mars</em> could be heard as a parallel-universe product of what the Flaming Lips could've turned into had they decided to further experiment with <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>'s background orchestral textures instead of streamlining them into <em>Yoshimi</em>'s compact electro-pop. With the two-part ""The Distance Between Mars and the Earth"", the Disneyfied acid trip of ""The Horrors of Isolation"", and wordless harmony haze of ""In Excelsior Vaginalistic"", you can imagine what <em>Bulletin</em> standards like ""A Spoonful Weighs a Ton"" and ""The Spark That Bled"" would sound like without the actual songs on top of them. <br/><br/>But the score is also a reminder of a time when the Lips were more interested in provoking their audience than pleasing it: The power-drilled drones of ""Your Spaceship Comes From Within"" play like a one-minute distillation of the half-hour electronic-noise oscillation they tacked onto 1992's <em>Hit to Death in the Future Head</em>, while the slow-motion tribal build of ""Suicide and Extraordinary Mistakes"" is accompanied by an ear-piercing, high-pitched frequency that harkens back to 1997's four-CD mind-fuck <em>Zaireeka</em>. <br/><br/>As the soundtrack progresses, it actually acquires a logic and momentum that isn't necessarily experienced watching the film, which tends to use this music in brief bursts-- for example, ""The Gleaming Armament of Marching Genitalia"" is a swell of Wagnerian pomp that soundtracks the aforementioned baby-crushing. On record the track is made more effective by an aftermath come-down with ""The Distress Signals of Celestial Objects"". In turn, the muted reverberations and droning crescendo of ""Distress Singnals"" sets the scene for ""Space Bible With Volume Lumps"", which manifests the film's claustrophobic tension with a ticking glitch beat, analog-synth loops and blaring trumpets.<br/><br/>In <em>Christmas on Mars</em>' closing credits, The Flaming Lips include a special thank you to the band's fans for their support and patience with the film; but for long-time followers of the band, that patience is truly rewarded by the soundtrack album, which-- following a series of tours that have more or less stuck to the same nightly script-- reassert the Flaming Lips' ability to surprise, experiment and freak us out. Tellingly, the <em>Christmas on Mars</em> DVD/CD package is housed in a regular CD jewel-case as opposed to the standard DVD long box-- the implication being that <em>Christmas on Mar</em>s is as much a film in service to a soundtrack as a soundtrack in service to a film.</p></div>"|12515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12515-christmas-on-mars/|7.1|Stuart Berman

Nina Simone was clearly the latter. Drawing on a wide swath of her catalog, from her first recording session to one of her last, producer Richard Seidel demonstrates how boldly she seized any song that caught her ear, as she marches through Duke Ellington, Kurt Weill, torch songs, folk songs, and the pop and rock hits of her day. A Julliard-trained pianist who played clubs while harboring an ambition to be a composer, Simone scored hits with a label that had to cede total creative control before she'd sign on their dotted line. Her performances were spontaneous, her mood impetuous and imperious. It's as hard to boil down the many facets of Simone's career as to romanticize the rough edges. <em>To Be Free</em> succeeds because it doesn't even try.¬†</p><p>Disc One is the most varied. A reading of Ellington's ""Mood Indigo"" from her first studio session opens the set, and introduces Simone as a smart jazz singer and a pianist with fingers of steel. She's unpredictable from her earliest cuts, with her playing erupting into sudden bursts of <em>forte </em>while she sings each lyric as if she's only just deciding what she thinks of it. Her voice is low and rich but its power, proven on tracks like ""I Put a Spell on You"", lies in its sudden intensity; and on the live tracks that make up roughly half the set, we hear a nightclub vet's knack for sensing every twitch in the crowd's mood, and a diva's gift for ignoring them at her whim.¬†</p><p>Her bloodcurdling performance of Weill's ""Pirate Jenny"" sears anyone who would ever think of the protagonist as less than a human being. She probably would have sung it the same way no matter what was happening in the Deep South, but it marks one of¬†the earliest times she addressed the civil rights movement.¬† Disc Two covers¬†the crucial period from 1968-69, starting with a live performance of ""Mississippi Goddam"" recorded days after the murder of Dr. King. ""I'm not <em>about </em>to be non-violent, honey!"" Simone cracks at one point, and she follows the statement with a laugh: Simone's no militant, but her resistance ain't passive, or saintly.</p>
<p>Instead, it's proud. By the late 60s Simone reveals herself as a hell of a singer for a rock band: you can hear it over the fierce ""Save Me"" and ""Revolution,"" and she sings 1968's ""Ain't Got No-I Got Life"" with every ounce of her body. And rebel or no, she was also on top of the pop trends, and knew the right artists to cover. The backing vocals on ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"" and ""Poppies"" date the performances, but her Bob Dylan covers are often exquisite-- especially ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"", which melts the¬†original's rambling blues into a reverie.</p>
<p>On Disc Three, the tunes get funkier, the grooves run longer, and the theaters are larger. The rambling but rousing centerpiece of her late-period disc is a 20-minute ""My Sweet Lord"" that segues in and out of a solo reading of ""Today Is a Killer""-- and ends with Simone's cry that the Lord ""is a killer."" (Even He can't escape her wrath.) But as the disc wears on, the performances start to sound exhausted, until they trail off in the early 70s. For context, you can turn to the DVD, which contains an edgy¬†documentary from 1970. This TV special features a candid interview interspersed with concert clips, the highlight being a startling performance of ""Go to Hell"" that catches her at her most dangerous. In conversation Simone frequently sounds like she's on the verge of either a burn-out or an epiphany, but she's revealing as she tries to pin down what ""freedom"" means to her: her definition-- that freedom means ""no fear""-- is as good a key as you'll get to this set.¬†</p>
<p>So many strong currents run through <em>To Be Free </em>that it's easy to cling to just one.¬† But right when we focus on her as a protest singer, we fall into a haunted ballad like ""The Other Woman""; and anyone who picks this up thinking they're getting brunch music wasn't counting on all the bongos.¬† Simone is missed, but this isn't a sentimental set, and¬†while it's tempting to juxtapose her eulogy for Dr. King with what happened on election day last month, that's just one part of what she fought for-- and one part of what made her free.</p></div>"|12516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12516-to-be-free-the-nina-simone-story/|9.2|Chris Dahlen

But when delivered in her deliberate, haunting cadence, the words have a weight greater than their surface meaning-- it's an apt beginning to an album that derives power from simplicity. Through her solo work and as a member of Charalambides, Carter has long been an expert avant-folk minimalist, mining depth from small, repetitive songs. On <em>Original Darkness </em>she's developed this skill to near-perfection.</p><p>Take the album's fourth track, ""Re-Found Mary"". Here Carter strums a single acoustic chord, adding electric guitar flourishes that are nearly as repetitive. On top, she slowly breathes elongated syllables as if hypnotized, with lyrics so elusive they are almost nonsensical: ""I re-found Mary/ In Forestville/ Cold pea princess/ Walking like a new mother."" But her intensity makes the song an eerie meditation, so tense it could burst at any second.</p><p><em>Original Darkness </em>is filled with such potent moments. Carter builds each song with her acoustic guitar, one or two chords at time, then adds a restrained electric guitar or a chilly keyboard. The results are so entrancing that the album could have worked as a collection of instrumentals. But Carter's voice matches the music so well, these songs practically are<em> </em>instrumentals, saying more with sound than words.</p>
<p>Those words skirt around their subjects evocatively, in a way perhaps best described as specific vagueness. This creates a sense of dislocation, even absence: ""We are losers‚Ä® of ourselves/ ‚Ä®In the car‚Ä® on the road to our destination,"" she intones in ""Fountain of Youth"". Later, during the sparse, Loren Connors-like ""You Are So Far Away"", Carter stoically insists that ""The flow of time is so important/ And I'm never in it."" And in ""Hidden Man"" she offers partial descriptions of an enigmatic figure, catching brief glimpses of his reflection.</p>
<p>Even when Carter gets more direct, the power of her songs comes in what's unsaid. On ""Do Not Love a Woman"", she balances the title with a list of womanly things she does love, as if wholes aren't as important as unconnected parts. ""Capable of Murder"" is even more specific, but still leaves details aside in favor of emotion.</p>
<p>The album ends with its prettiest piece, the hymn-like ""Do You Recognize My Voice?"" Over a soaring keyboard, Carter describes a voice that ""sounds like a voice I have heard before‚Ä®/ All contained within a familiar voice/ The voices of women, the voices of men."" Harmonizing with herself, Carter seems to suggest that she's found the key to all songs inside a single, simple melody. If that's her claim, it's hard to imagine a more convincing case than <em>Original Darkness</em>.</p></div>"|12512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12512-original-darkness/|7.9|Marc Masters

It clouds the way we view and think about the country to the extent that we in the United States are blinded to anything beyond the violence of the last few years and the atrocities of the Saddam Hussein era. The obscuring effect of recent events leads me to believe that Honest Jon's <em>Give Me Love</em> might be the most important archival compilation of the year. Outside of a very small number of performers, including oudist Munir Bashir and jazz musician Amir ElSaffar, very little Iraqi music has ever made an impact internationally. Indeed, for most of the 20th century the popular music of Iraq and most of the rest of the Arab world lived completely within the shadow of Lebanese and especially Egyptian artists.</p><p>This compilation, then, represents one of a precious few attempts to provide a clear window into the cultural life of a widely misunderstood place-- the Iraq of the late 1920s, during a period of British hegemony in the region that began when the Ottomans were driven out of Mesopotamia during the First World War. The Gramophone Company and its subsidiary His Master's Voice-- HMV today-- were the first major companies to make recordings in 1925. (In the pursuit of record buyers' money the world over, Gramophone unwittingly provided one of the greatest cultural services of the 20th century by sending its recording engineers across the globe to document local musics-- I'd give a lot to be allowed several weeks in a hypothetical Gramophone vault.) Others quickly followed, including Polyphone, Baidaphon, Odeon, and Columbia, but all the recordings included here are drawn from HMV's nearly 900 78 rpm sides, all made from 1925 to 1929.</p><p>When approaching this compilation, it's important to remember something that's true of records from all eras: the recording medium is a part of the music. In today's studio, you might have 64 tracks, 20 different kinds of microphones, and an infinite amount of extra gear your can pile onto a record. Then, they had a mechanical recording device with a horn that the musicians had to be carefully arranged around to get the right mix of sounds. The dawn of electrical recording was right around 1925; by 1926, it was the norm in most of the world. But the liners here state pretty plainly that most of these records were made without microphones, and I frankly don't know enough of the difference to argue the point. What I can tell you is that this disc is nearly devoid of the surface crackle of 78s, and the sound is very clear. But one shouldn't expect a modern range of frequency response, as the low-end of performances rarely registered well on 1920s recordings.</p>
<p>What you will hear are impassioned performances, instrumental and vocal, from some of the most well-regarded performers in Baghdad of the era. Most of them are Jewish-- for various reasons, Iraq's religious minorities dominated the country's music prior to the 1950s, when the vast majority of Christians and essentially all the Jews fled. This exodus began during World War II after a pro-Nazi coup d'etat and subsequent pogrom. Audiences were split by gender-- public performances for men by women were looked down upon, and many, though not all, female singers were recruited from brothels, which was another barrier to respect. The few recordings by women included here have same melismatic fire as their male counterparts, though, and nearly every track has the characteristic Iraqi slowness that makes the country's music distinct in spite of obvious Egyptian, Persian, and Indian influences. The other caution for modern listeners is not to expect the kind of hook-filled instant gratification we're used to today-- this is music you need to soak in and feel, from the aching love songs to the frenetic instrumental taqsims.</p>
<p>The ornamental vocals mask often straightforward lyrics, which translate to phrases such as ""I wait for my lover on tenterhooks,"" ""Since you left me my eyes are on the brink of shutting down for good,"" and ""Short of dying, how can I get you out of mind?"" Songs of the brokenhearted indeed. The instrumentation consists of small ensembles, with violin, oud (an Arabic lute played with a fluttering, staccato technique), mutbij (a wooden double flute with a wailing, nasal tone), qanun (a type of zither) and hand percussion. Some songs include small choirs positioned far from the horn. This was an urban type of arrangement, and many rural songs were transposed to these ensembles for recording purposes-- it's important to note that these weren't field recordings, but rather popular music recordings intended for a very competitive marketplace.</p>
<p>I have a few small issues with the compilation itself as a package-- while the liner notes paint a vivid picture of 1920s Baghdad and provide substantial background, they also don't include any recording notes for individual tracks, or even Gramophone catalog numbers, which is the kind of information collectors of this music like to have. There's also no real account of the reasoning behind the track selection-- out of the 900 available, why these, in this order? Sometimes knowing the compilers' organizing principle can be illuminating. Those concerns aside, though, this is a compelling peek at the soul of Iraq that's been so long obscured to us by the fog of war.</p></div>"|12510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12510-give-me-love-songs-of-the-brokenhearted-baghdad-1925-1929/|8.6|Joe Tangari

Unlike most of her contemporaries, though, the transplanted Norwegian's success isn't owed to her fashionability (she isn't) or her dynamism as a songwriter (even at her most arresting, she verges on adult contemporary), but rather, a workmanlike dependability. A typical Ane Brun song favors spare instrumentation, slightly broken sentiment, and an unwavering devotion to prettiness; aside from occasional detours into folksy MOR and unlikely covers (her warbly take on Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors"" is currently ad agency catnip in Europe), it's a formula she's stuck to over the years with dogged consistency.<br/><br/><em>Changing of the Seasons</em> feels like the record where Brun's lack of range catches up to her. Where her previous productions have benefitted from creating chasms of space through reverb and cavernous silence, this album-- a breakup record-- feels weighed down by the same tactic. Much of it is laid so bare it can be difficult to locate the songs within: For all the irrefutable prettiness, there's precious little to hang on to; a lot of the songs are strung-together tapestries of incomplete hooks, rustic guitar riffs, and generous dollops of strings and backing vocals that don't coalesce into anything more. <br/><br/>Which isn't to say there aren't highlights; they just aren't very immediate. Opener ""The Treehouse Song""-- an exception, and possibly the best thing she's ever done-- raises false hopes by channelling vintage Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton for a moment of uncharacteristically robust folksiness. It turns out to be a red herring, though; by the next song, Brun's back to her torpid, tiptoeing ways. It's a look she barely relinquishes for the remainder of the record, and while single ""The Fall"", the broody ""Ten Seconds"", and the promising but unrealized ""Don't Leave"" earn honorable mentions as best in breed, its ultimately Brun's dourness-- not her music-- that ultimately leaves the most lasting impression. If it's a downer you're after, there are better records than this.</p></div>"|12513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12513-changing-of-the-seasons/|5.2|Mark Pytlik

""Can you make something for the girls?"" she asks. ""Like, we so pretty in our Louis Vuitton?"" One track later, the brothers Thornton repurpose the airily gorgeous beat from Slim's ""So Fly"" to snarl nihilistically empty sex-talk: ""Not do demean 'em, but that's just how we seen 'em/ Trading bitches off since balling was buying Zimas."" As the track ends, Pusha T cackles viciously: ""See, sis? We do girl records, right?"" Watch what you wish for, I guess.<br/><br/>Thing is, once upon a time, Clipse were able to do girl records, or something like them, anyway, in a way that didn't just turn the songs into morbid jokes. With breakout single ""Grindin'"", Malice and Pusha established the dead-eyed coke-talk they're still running with six years later. But they also made ""When the Last Time"", one of this century's greatest club jams. On that and a handful of other <em>Lord Willin'</em> tracks-- songs released in 2002, when the duo had something to do with the commercial rap landscape-- Clipse seemed totally genuine talking about how club night was one of the reasons they loved life, and their cold monotones worked just as well on frothy dance-pop tracks as on harshly mechanical tough-guy shit. That was them on Justin Timberlake's ""Like I Love You"", after all.<br/><br/>That Clipse is gone now. In the intervening years, they've left rap's mainstream behind completely, becoming internet cult heroes by diligently and eloquently pursuing two basic subjects: selling drugs and the money that comes with it. This has made for some ferociously exciting music, as on long-delayed sophomore album <em>Hell Hath No Fury</em> and the now-classic <em>We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 2</em> mixtape. But they've been hammering away at those two subjects with single-minded focus for years now, and the wear is starting to show.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair to call <em>Road to Till the Casket Drops</em>, their new mixtape, a disappointment. After all, this is a brisk half-hour of free new music from one of rap's greatest groups. The <em>Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 3</em> mixtape, released earlier this year, dwelled hard on <em>Fury</em>'s disappointing sales and leaned a bit too much on underwhelming original beats. But now they're back on their <em>Vol. 2</em> shit, hijacking up-to-the-moment rap-radio fodder (featherweight synth-tracks like Ryan Leslie's ""Addiction"" and Ron Browz's ""Pop Champagne"", clattering trunk-rattle shit like ""Swagger Like Us"" and T.I.'s ""Swing Ya Rag""). More often than not, they blow away the originals. Re-Up Gang associate Sandman, the weakest link in the extended group, has left, and so now we get an undiluted blast of pure Thornton brothers along with a couple of guest appearances from Re-Up survivor Ab-Liva, whose verse over the ""Pop Champagne"" beat is a thing of breathless beauty. And Malice and Pusha just have incredible voices, precise and almost technically fussy flows that can drip with contempt like nobody since circa-1999 Jay-Z.<br/><br/>So yeah, a new Clipse mixtape is always a good thing, well worth your half-hour and zero dollars. But <em>Road to Till the Casket Drops</em> finds Clipse spinning their wheels a bit. That's understandable; when you've spent years working hard to come up with convoluted cocaine punchlines, it makes sense that the well would be running dry. But every previous Clipse release, official and otherwise, was so jammed with great lines that it could be tough picking out moments to quote. On this one, the best line comes on the first track. Pusha: ""It's the hood's Obama, shoveling McCain/ Out the project windows, the drama's insane."" Pusha aims a few unwieldy darts at Lil Wayne, which seems a bit pointless; only Wayne is going to end Wayne's hot streak. ""Feds Taking Pictures"" starts with a long list of shoutouts to specific drug dealers, which isn't all that interesting unless you happen to be one of those drug dealers.<br/><br/>Again, I'm mostly just quibbling here. This is a quickie mixtape intended to celebrate the launch of Clipse's new clothing line Play Cloths, which is unfortunately saddled with both one of the worst names and worst logos in rapper-clothing-line history. As a quickie mixtape, it beats the everliving fuck out of virtually all its mixhut competition. A lot of this stuff was probably recorded on a tight schedule, relatively tossed-off. But nothing these guys did used to sound tossed-off. And maybe by the time they release their next album (next year, lord willin'), Clipse should look beyond the corner and make a few tracks that don't revolve around white powder. Like, for instance, maybe some girl songs. Just a thought.</p></div>"|12496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12496-road-to-till-the-casket-drops/|7.6|Tom Breihan

He didn't set his piano on fire. Didn't wear blue suede shoes. Didn't become a preacher, marry his cousin, or go to jail. He wasn't what you'd call handsome, at least not in the sublime way that Elvis wore his looks. He was neither a rebel nor a rabble-rouser. He stood stock still and kept his head up. He sang about crying over girls, and his signature shades hid the tears in his eyes. He played a mean guitar, but sang a meaner ballad. He yearned and wept, but never moped. His stoic demeanor¬†lent his tales of heartbreak a dignity that gave them verisimilitude and told his teenage listeners that all their confusion and pain-- all part of the culture, even if shunned by adults-- were real and worthwhile.</p><p>Most efforts to laud Orbison, a first-generation rock'n'roller whose earliest hits were recorded at Sun Studio alongside Elvis, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins, tend to appraise him as the granddaddy of some current trend, like emo, when in fact he is, like Bruce Springsteen or Tom Waits, a more singular artist. With its natural quaver and multi-octave range, his voice allowed him to do things other singers could not, and his best singles pair his stately vocals with equally ornate arrangements. However, if indie musicians wanted to shelve their copies of <em>Pet Sounds</em> and <em>Born to Run</em> for a few years and start taking notes on Orbison, not only would that make my job a whole lot more interesting, but <em>The Soul of Rock and Roll</em> would be the place for them to start.</p><p>This 4xCD box set is the most expansive and exhaustive summary of Orbison's decades-long career, which had its share of ups (the early 1960s, the late 80s) and downs (the 70s) and ended on an impossibly high note with his 1989 best-selling album <em>Mystery Girl</em> and his work with the Traveling Wilburys. Most Orbison comps begin at Sun Studio, with tender teenage hits ""Devil Doll"" and ""Ooby Dooby"" (Orbison may be the only singer who can make those two syllables not sound sexual and still sound interesting), but this set finds life before Memphis. Orbison was a guitar slinger with the Teen Kings in the early 50s, drawing from vocal groups, country and western, and rockabilly without really synthesizing them. Perhaps the most revealing track is ""Guitar Pull Medley"", a previously unreleased nine-minute recording of Orbison, by request, ripping through covers like ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You"" and ""That's All Right"" at a party, proving he could hold his own against his more popular labelmate Elvis. Orbison's cool and easy proficiency with so many songs contrasts with his companion's starry-eyed demeanor. It sounds like a scene from Robert Altman's <em>Nashville</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Soul of Rock and Roll</em> is broken down primarily by decade-- a logical organizing principle even if it doesn't actually fit his career very precisely. Still, that means the second disc is far and away the best here, with a run of hits for Nashville-based Monument Records that's about as close to perfect as possible. ""Uptown"", ""Only the Lonely"", ""Blue Angel"", ""In Dreams"", and ""Running Scared"" (a modified bolero) are grandiose and operatic, lushly arranged, cleverly recorded (all in one take, with no overdubs), and as genuinely moving as pop music can be. Cathedrals to heartbreak, these early Monument recordings represent not only the set's high point, but the heyday of Orbison's career and the era that defined the rest of his catalog. The rest of his 60s output follows the same template, as Orbison and producer Fred Foster give similar treatment to ""All I Have to Do Is Dream"", the gorgeous ""Blue Bayou"", and the Willie Nelson-penned ""Pretty Paper"".</p>
<p>The third disc covers Orbison's 70s output, but almost all of these songs predate that decade by several years. Following the deaths of his first wife in a motorcycle accident and two of his sons in a house fire, he spent most of the 70s away from the spotlight, but <em>The Soul of Rock and Roll</em> uses that downtime to argue convincingly that his strengths as a balladeer were matched by his prowess as a guitarist and his power as a performer. From 1963, his cover of ""Mean Woman Blues"", with its relentless beat, effervescent sha-la-la backing vocals, and yakkety sax, actually swings, especially on his fiery guitar solo. And his take on Ray Charles' ""What'd I Say"", recorded live in Holland, stomps and shimmies like his early rockabilly material.</p>
<p>The final chapter is far and away the most surprising, a plot twist that no one could have predicted: Instead of fading away like, say, Carl Perkins, Orbison launched an improbable late-in-life comeback that's all the more remarkable for breezily updating his signature style while sidestepping bland dinosaur rock. ""You Got It"" and ""She's a Mystery to Me"", both from his swan song <em>Mystery Girl</em>, show only a few new wrinkles in his voice, which add texture and authority. His new recordings of ""Oh Pretty Woman"" and ""In Dreams"", both for his 1987 greatest hits album, of course can't improve on the originals, but aren't the disasters most re-recordings turn out to be. And Orbison is perfectly at home with the Traveling Wilburys on ""Not Alone Anymore"", although his verse on ""Handle With Care"" makes that song a notable omission in this set.</p>
<p>The worst I can say about <em>The Soul of Rock and Roll</em> is that the liner notes are particularly unrevealing, a missed opportunity. An artist like Orbison, who despite his success haunts the periphery of rock history, not the center, demands a more balanced and in-depth approach that can contextualize his music without resorting to namedropping and can relate meaningful commentary without resorting to anecdote. Missing that textual component, the set loses some of its impact, but Orbison's songs-- at once modest and grandiose, showy and private-- provide all the testimony he needs.¬†</p></div>"|12474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12474-the-soul-of-rock-and-roll/|8.6|Stephen M.

The duo's debut album, <em>Welcome to the Welcome Wagon</em>, is a collection of intricate Christian folksongs designed to inspire vigorous clap-alongs and, perhaps, the occasional glaze-and-sniffle. Recorded, engineered, mixed, and designed by Sufjan Stevens (he also wrote the liner notes, released it on his label, Asthmatic Kitty, and contributes banjo, bass, drums, electric and acoustic guitar, percussion, piano, ukulele, and vocals), <em>Welcome to the Welcome Wagon</em> sounds-- yup-- an awful lot like a Sufjan Stevens album: rich, almost childlike vocal harmonies, gentle banjo strums, and elaborate orchestral arrangements coalescing into something warm, layered, and instantly familiar.<br/><br/>Given Stevens' role in the album's conception and creation, a comparison to his own back catalogue might seem facile, but it's also hopelessly true (even Vito Aituo's soft, nudging pipes sound awfully similar to Stevens' own). Still, Stevens isn't employed as a songwriter-- aside from covers of the Velvet Underground's ""Jesus"" and the Smiths' ""Half a Person"", Vito Aiuto is credited with composing most of the music, occasionally borrowing lyrics from old sermons or hymns (or, in the case of ""Sold! To the Nice Rich Man"", from Daniel Smith of Danielson and Danielson Famile), and he and Monique trade off on lead vocals, backed, always, by a crew of pretty, plaintive crooners.<br/><br/>A mix of original illustrations and images snatched from ""funeral cards and vacation bible school paraphernalia,"" the album's artwork is deliberately and unapologetically cloying, and skillfully evokes the silk rose-covered toilet paper basket aesthetic of your grandmother's bathroom. But that's kind of the point: The entire project is impeccably stylized, from the soft-focus colored pencil drawings of children clutching bibles to the Aiutos' own real life pastor-and-his-wife mythology. There are plenty of winks at ageless bible kitsch (see the blue-suited, Ken-haired pastor on the album's back cover, accompanied by the text ""Why does our pastor preach from the BIBLE in our church?"", or the toddler in a yellow shirt, pointing at, duh, his Bible) but <em>Welcome to the Welcome Wagon</em> is nothing if not earnestly rendered. Stevens admits that most of these tracks were recorded in apartments, and they have the scrappy, church-choir feel of people sitting around, singing together. Maybe eating sandwich cookies in between takes.<br/><br/>And while <em>Welcome to the Welcome Wagon</em> might not be unprecedented, exactly, it does contain a slew of truly great songs: ""But for You Who Fear My Name""-- written by Lenny Smith, father of Daniel and the grand-patriarch of the Famile-- is a deliciously light stomp-and-clap folk song, with a squiggly electric guitar line and perfectly metered lyrics about salvation. ""American Legion"", one of the less explicitly religious songs here, is a sweet, heartfelt love song (""I still have the last letter you left for me, all your t-shirts, your red and green pedigree, all the rest is sealed up behind memory,"" Vito whispers), while opener ""Up on a Mountain"", sung predominantly by Monique-- whose voice is beautifully, improbably innocent-- is both terrifying and lulling (when she sings ""It's a long way down,"" you'll be inclined to believe her).<em><br/><br/>Welcome to the Welcome Wagon</em> feels a bit like a pet-project (check that full-color picture of Svengali Stevens, wearing a Michigan hat and holding a microphone!), but it's also endearing and sweet (despite the copious Biblical blood shed therein), and, most important, as addictive as anything: Like any good folk record, these tracks lodge in your subconscious, reemerging while you're chopping potatoes for dinner, tugging on your mittens, or curling into bed. And you'll like it that way.</p></div>"|12506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12506-welcome-to-the-welcome-wagon/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

Sure, the novelty of perennial sadsacks Low celebrating the happiest time of the year on 1999's <em>Christmas</em> EP got some of the elves' pointy ears perked. And in 2004, even Charlie Brown would've rocked Dust-to-Digital's <em>Where Will You Be Christmas Day</em> anthology of pre-1960 curios, a fine album as anti-commercial as I'm told indie culture once was. As recently as 2006, though, Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum could, with a relatively straight (bearded!) face, call Sufjan Stevens ""something like the bizarro GG Allin"" for releasing a box set devoted to what, ""in the photo-negative world of indie rock morality...might be the most obscene concept possible"": Christmas. Peace and love were for poseurs, or, worse, hippie jam-band dudes.</p><p>We were so much older then; I guess we're younger than that now. <em>I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas</em>, Force Field PR chief Daniel Gill's new digital-only compilation of indie-oriented yuletide carols, comes out in a year when indie-friendly bands as big as Weezer and Coldplay or as modest as the Raveonettes and the Boy Least Likely To are all releasing seasonal tunes. The Hives faced off in ""A Christmas Duel"" with Cyndi Lauper; Stephen Colbert sang about the miracle of drugs with Willie Nelson. The Flaming Lips, who acknowledged the holiday on 2003's ""A Change at Christmas (Say It Isn't So)"", are now spending a long-awaited <em>Christmas on Mars</em>, while Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, and Skull Gang are working on a sort of sequel to 2006's <em>A Dipset Christmas</em>.</p><p>Like Hard to Find a Friend's <em>Peace on Earth Vol. II</em> compilation, though-- which benefits the Children of Uganda Fund, and features Oxford Collapse, among many others-- <em>I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas</em> goes to a cause greater than commercialism; Amnesty International gets all the proceeds of the release. The idea for the album apparently came from a tradition Gill and his wife, Reda Rountree, started several years ago of making Christmas-music compilations for friends and family. And don't look for Sufjan-style reverse-transgressiveness: The songs on <em>I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas</em> meet the holiday from a place as weary and conflicted as we all are.</p>
<p>They're frequently quite good, too. Two reimagined modern Christmas classics bookend the album: Au Revoir Simone remake <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>'s ""Christmas Time Is Here"" into a halting, snowflake-pretty indie pop tune bringing to mind the Postmarks, while Belong's Turk Dietrich dismembers Elvis's ""Blue Christmas"" in a way previous ""Blue Christmas""-coverer Bright Eyes could never drink enough purple stuff to imagine. (Lil Wayne, on the other hand...) There's sadness in the air: No Kids bend genders as they stoically face ""Another Winter in This Summer Town"", from the 2006 musical <em>Grey Gardens</em>, and Postal Service member Jimmy Tamborello's Figurine evoke the plainspoken duets of Yo La Tengo over chattering electronics on decent breakup anthem ""The Holidays Behind Us"". If nothing here is likely to enter the canon of shopping malls and Delilah specials like Mariah Carey's undeniable ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", well, that's more befitting the spirit of Charlie Brown (and indie culture) anyway.</p>
<p><em>I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas</em> can also do traditional. My Brightest Diamond's reading of standard ""Nature Boy"" belongs in a long line of haunting, vocal-driven Christmas songs that still put me to sleep, but her powerful performance makes the closing maxim pack an extra wallop (yeah, yeah, it's the song from <em>Moulin Rouge</em>). Blitzen Trapper and Arthur &amp; Yu turn in solid folkie efforts, though only one makes reference to Steve McQueen (full disclosure: I've known Blitzen's now-manager since before Christmas 1989). Sure, a few of the tracks are just so-so, including probably the sharpest left turn: Au's seasick ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"", a bold idea that doesn't quite work. But then there's Sally Shapiro's winsome 2007 favorite ""Anorak Christmas (Piano Mix)"", a rosy-cheeked synth-pop take on all that love and joy crap that probably still makes some aging indie puritans gag. Hark! The herald angel sings.</p></div>"|12509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12509-ill-stay-til-after-christmas/|6.8|Marc Hogan

After all, on their debut album they play dreamy pop with a kind of stone-faced earnestness that only the very young possess. And like other short-in-the-tooth bands, they've yet to establish their own identity and instead blatantly borrow from their predecessors. Remember that semester when you went punk or grew a beard or started dressing solely in Goodwill polyester, and your new ""look"" briefly became your new personality? In much the same way, the Uglysuit spend most of their self-titled album trying on musical guises, perhaps as a way to suss out what kind of band they'd like to be.</p><p>The jangle and washed-out harmonies of tracks like ""Brownblue Passing"" suggest that Uglysuit are comfortable with territory already well-worn by the Shins, while ""...And We Became Sunshine"" features frontman Israel Hindman's eerily uncanny Conor Oberst imitation. Despite being so familiar, both songs are still charming in a wistful, glassy-eyed kind of way. ""Chicago"", with its glossy keyboard, soaring chorus, and plaintive vocals, is the collection's most accessible track, sounding like an updated, echo-laden version of the Counting Crows' ""Long December"". Instrumental interlude ""Elliot Travels"" feels at first like an out-of-place piano fantasia on an already short album. But when combined with the vertigo-inducing carnival ""Anthem Of The Arctic Birds"" that follows, it suggests that the band's truest influence is those delightful weirdoes from their hometown, the Flaming Lips.</p><p>Two of the nine tracks expand beyond the seven-minute mark, and it's when the Uglysuit stretch out that they seem to be having the most fun. ""Everyone Now Has a Smile"" and the aforementioned ""...And We Became Sunshine"" could use stronger hooks to anchor their crashing, psychedelic orchestrations, but they're still enjoyable and infused with a confidence lacking on the rest of the album.¬† <br/><br/>The Uglysuit are certainly competent, but on this debut their music feels too by-the-book. Where are the surprises? With nothing unexpected and without a distinct musical personality of their own, the band feels too much like an indie-rock Frankenstein's monster, a creature born in the lab of a music supervisor for the CW. Their debut is perfect for soundtracking that bittersweet breakup on ""Gossip Girl""<em> </em>or<em> ""</em>One Tree Hill"", but alone on a stereo, devoid of visual accompaniment, it's ultimately kind of empty. Which brings us back to the band's youth. <em>The Uglysuit</em> in a sense feels like a freshman survey class of modern indie, covering all the biggies (from Bright Eyes to Wilco) but failing in the details. They have potential, though, so here's hoping the Uglysuit graduate soon.</p></div>"|12475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12475-the-uglysuit/|4.8|Rebecca Raber

With its crystalline production (courtesy of R.E.M. architect Mitch Easter and Bryce Goggin) and more refined songcraft, Pavement's 1997 release <em>Brighten the Corners</em> was the logical follow-up to 1994's indie hit <em>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</em>. But of course, that move from A to B took a tangential turn back to Z with 1995's notoriously slapdash <em>Wowee Zowee</em>, an album beloved by the band's diehard fans, but one that effectively squandered any crossover potential <em>Crooked Rain</em> might have built up (and which would've made a lot more sense as <em>Crooked Rain</em>'s predecessor than successor). <br/><br/><em>Brighten the Corners</em>' more focused, melodic approach could thus be heard as the sound of Pavement making amends, but it arguably came too late-- by 1997, modern-rock radio was already tuning out brainy indie-rock in favour of pre-fab pop-punk and numbskull nu-metal. Pavement understood this shift all to well, which could be why <em>Brighten the Corners</em> sounds like their most self-aware and, by extension, honest album-- when Stephen Malkmus yells, ""listen to me, I'm on the stereo!"" on the album's excitable opening track, it's with the implicit knowledge that he'd have to settle for hearing himself on his home hi-fi rather than on KROQ. <br/><br/>Perhaps as an attempt to reconnect with their pre-<em>Wowee Zowee</em> catalogue, <em>Brighten the Corners</em> takes various structural cues from previous Pavement albums: as on 1992's <em>Slanted and Enchanted</em>, the second song fades into a brief instrumental; the slowly intensifying mid-song jam on third track ""Transport Is Arranged"" sounds like it was grafted from <em>Crooked Rain</em>'s own third track ""Stop Breathin""; and Malkmus still couldn't resist the glaring name-drop (though <em>Crooked Rain</em>'s now-dated Stone Temple Pilots/Smashing Pumpkins swipes were replaced by more eternal ruminations about the peculiar oration of Geddy Lee). Consistent with this self-reflexivity, Malkmus cheekily addresses his own status as the most overanalyzed lyricist in 90s indie-rock, describing himself as ""an island of such great complexity,"" declaring that ""if my soul has a shape, well, then it is an ellipse,"" and even raging that he's ""sick of being misread by men in dashikis and their leftist weeklies."" (That said, it would take 11 years and one ridiculous Republican campaign to lend any significance to the line ""there's no women in Alaska."") <br/><br/>The May 1997 Alex Ross <em>New Yorker</em> essay that accompanies this reissue-- the fourth in Matador's superlative series of Pavement packages-- focuses on Malkmus' lyrical gift for extracting substance out of nonsense, and the folly of trying to saddle it with literal interpretations. But on no other Pavement album do all those bon mots and non sequitirs form such a coherent picture of the band's emotional state. Even the album title-- the only one that doesn't rely on rhymes and/or alliteration-- is telling: Rather than re-ignite the band's commercial prospects, <em>Brighten the Corners</em> marked the beginning of Pavement's slow fade into the sunset, while shedding light on its principal songwriter's future course.<br/><br/>Not coincidentally, both Malkmus and co-founder Scott ""Spiral Stairs"" Kannberg turned 30 during the album's recording, and both sound consumed by all the melancholy, anxiety, loaded significance, and renewed perspective that life-change carries. Malkmus' charming, chiming ""Shady Lane"" reasserts the ""settle down"" sentiment of <em>Crooked Rain</em>'s ""Range Life"", and ""Transport Is Arranged"" seems to address the historically conflicted dynamic between relationships and life on the road (""a voice coach taught me to sing, he couldn't teach me to love""); Kannberg's two exemplary contributions-- the Big Starry-eyed power-pop rush ""Date w/ Ikea"" and the smooth Stonesy funk of ""Passat Dream""-- equate responsibility and commitment with consumerism.<br/><br/>Easter and Goggin's luminous production casts this wistfulness in an appropriately soft-focus lens; in return, the band, so scatterbrained on <em>Wowee Zowee</em>, turn in their most pleasingly patient performances of their career, establishing a deeper sense of space through the use of mellotrons, drum-machine breaks and synths set on ""swoosh."" The dreamily drifty centerpiece track ""Type Slowly"" now sounds like a dry run for the sort of exploratory jams Malkmus would fashion in his post-Pavement band the Jicks (a point driven home by the extended, more volcanic live version included here), while the closing two jangle ballads, ""Starlings of the Slipstream"" and ""Fin"" are two of the most affecting songs in the Pavement canon, each appended with guitar solos that compensate for Malkmus' still-developing chops with genuinely pained expression. If ""Fin"" didn't prove to be the band's actual swan song, the track does sound like a farewell to Pavement's wiseacre persona. <br/><br/>But if <em>Brighten the Corners</em> signaled a turn to the serious, the 32 outtakes and radio-session cuts compiled here give Pavement plenty of room to, as one B-side aptly puts it, ""fuck around."" Which means indie-rock in-jokes (the Pussy Galore pastiche of ""Neil Hagerty Meets Jon Spencer in a Non-Alcoholic Bar""), 1960s pop goofs (""Nigel""), cartoon themes (two stabs at ""Space Ghost""), and kill-yr-idols covers of the Clean (Kannberg's electro-fried take on ""Oddity""), Echo and the Bunnymen (a Crazy Horsed interpretation of ""The Killing Moon""), and heroes-turned-nemeses the Fall (a gleeful desecration of the already blasphemous ""The Classical""). And in the seven-minute rough cut of stoner-rock dirge ""(And Then) The Hexx"" and the freewheeling biker-bar boogie of ""Roll With the Wind"", you can hear Malkmus moving ever closer to adopting his future role as beardless-hippie guitar hero. <br/><br/>According to the liner notes, ""(And Then) The Hexx"" was originally intended to be <em>Brighten the Corners</em>' opener, but its sinister creep would've made an awkward introduction to the album's more winsome, mellowed-out material. (The song eventually surfaced on 1999's <em>Terror Twilight</em>.) However, that same rationale might also explain why the terrific ""Harness Your Hopes"" was demoted to B-side status, it being perhaps the most typically Pavementy Pavement song ever: the reductive, repetitive Velvet Underground riff; the rhyme-a-second wordplay (""nun is to church as the parrot is to perch""); and a line that seemingly sums up the band's conflicted, outsider relationship with the pop world-- ""Show me/ A word that rhymes with Pavement."" Given that <em>Brighten the Corners</em> captured Malkmus trying to break free from Pavement's established aesthetic-- and given that, two years later at London's Brixton Acadmey, he would famously sum up his feelings about the band by waving a pair of handcuffs-- the word he was looking for was under his nose along: enslavement.</p></div>"|12499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12499-brighten-the-corners-nicene-creedence-ed/|8.7|Stuart Berman

He's referring to his 1994 song ""I Used to Love H.E.R."", where he began to seriously define himself as a moralistic foil to the gangster rap phenomenon. The reference seems ironic on an album this vacuous and amoral.</p><p>Then again, the song has been ironic from the start. In conflating hip-hop's downfall with that of a loose woman, Common succumbed to a definitive moral hazard-- misogyny-- of the gangster rap he railed against. During the last faint reverberations of hip-hop's so-called golden age, this odd blend of puritanical defiance and doomed acquiescence wasn't unusual. Notice how, on A Tribe Called Quest's ""Check the Rhime"", Phife goes from ""have all my hos in check"" to ""my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk"" in three seconds flat.</p><p>Common emerged (as Common Sense) at the tail end of Afrocentric rap's heyday, which helped him escape obsolescence as his peers fell by the wayside. Treading the precarious line between positive maverick and mainstream star has defined him for his entire career. On <em>Be </em>and <em>Finding Forever</em>, with assistance from Kanye West, he struck a winning, humanizing balance between moralism and hedonism, proving that the two needn't be mutually exclusive. But on <em>Universal Mind Control</em>, his personalities split off into what seem like two wildly different EPs, one awful and one tepid.</p>
<p>The awful half is the first one, a bizarre concoction of featherweight electro, sex raps √† la LL Cool J, ""Sir Psycho Sexy""-era Red Hot Chili Peppers, party-starting clich√©s, and interminable A-A-A-A rhyme patterns that were fresh circa ""Rapper's Delight"". Putting aside the obvious laziness of Common's lyrics and the Neptunes' production, it seems more than anything like a profound failure of self-awareness. On the title track, Pharrell informs us that ""This is that new shit and it don't feel the same,"" which Common contradicts with an almost satirically old-school ""dang diggy dang da-dang da-dang dang.""</p>
<p>""Punch Drunk Love (The Eye)"" is just cynical, with its throwaway Kanye hook (gotta get him in the credits somehow) and buried Auto-Tuned singing by Pharrell. ""Make My Day"" benefits from a jovial Cee-Lo cameo and a spry jackhammer beat by Mr. DJ that a harder rapper would eat up, but Common needs warm, soulful beats to thrive, and he mostly sounds lost here. At least the inane lyrics (""Baby girl I'm a man/ And we can do this my way/ Take a ride on the highway/ And pretend that it's Friday... and it is!"") gain some incidental surging effects from Mr. DJ's efforts. The ugly, blocky nadir ""Sex 4 Suga"" sounds like an Andy Samberg parody. Things settle down a little with ""Announcement"", but you know you've got a problem when a Pharrell verse actually <em>livens up</em> your song.</p>
<p>The tepid second half is oddly something of a relief. Common shows signs of life on ""Gladiator"", surging powerfully over noir strings and jittery piano, but comparing yourself to Nelson Mandela-- not to mention ""a radical"" who ""don't fit the game""-- is a tough sell on this record. At least Common sounds comfortable amid the breezy chimes and canned platitudes. A perfunctory Obama shout-out on ""Changes"" finds Common taking a rare glimpse outside of himself, but it's too little, too late. <em>Universal Mind Control</em> is a painful misstep from a talented rapper who's decided to be as nasty as he wants to be-- which turns out to be much, much nastier than we'd like.</p></div>"|12508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12508-universal-mind-control/|2.8|Brian Howe

Despite her progress, it wasn't until 2006's quasi-breakout single ""The Operator"" that folks outside her hometown scene in Berlin began to take notice. During those years as electro-pop's underappreciated shapeshifter, she gradually began to focus more on her own unique vocals, and now they serve as the central component (alongside the piano) of her current material. Morgenstern's fifth solo album, <em>BM</em> (her initials, naturally), is the artist's most personal yet, and finds her further shedding the digital elements of her previous records.</p><p>While her present tracks could fairly be described as avant-pop (think newcomer Lia Ices or Bj√∂rk, even), Morgenstern is undoubtedly an electronic musician at heart. Even mostly organic numbers like album opener ""Driving My Car"" follow the build-and-release configuration so distinct to techno. In this song and others, instruments introduce themselves progressively at staggered intervals before congregating at a chorus or a stirring coda. ""Reich und Ber√ºhmt"" (""Rich and Famous"") shares this quality, its stiff drums and treated guitars joining together with Morgenstern's emotive coos during an anthemic chorus section. These complex arrangements add distinctiveness to <em>BM</em> but also a hint of inaccessibility; the record sometimes feels difficult to penetrate.</p><p>That's not to say that <em>BM</em> is any less accomplished than past triumphs <em>Nichts Muss</em> or <em>The Grass Is Always Greener</em>, even if it's far less immediate. Morgenstern is more ambitious here and stingier with moments of melodic sweetness; as such, there's nothing as instantly compelling or hooky as ""The Operator"" on this album. ""Morbus Basedow"" probably comes closest, with its aggressive beat pattern that brings to mind the wallop of 2006's extraterrestrial banger ""Get UR Fleece On"" from Glasgow-based producer Izu. Outside of this lone club moment, though, <em>BM</em> is principally concerned with drawing emotion and intimacy from its circuitous instrumentals and technically intricate vocal pop.¬†</p>
<p>In aesthetic terms, the record feels crafted with wintertime night drives in mind; its coloring and textures are classically (and unmistakably) German. Haunting and guitar driven, ""Come to Berlin"" utilizes <em>Low</em>-era Bowie/Eno arrangements to appraise her currently fashionable city. When Morgenstern asks her audience, ""Isn't Berlin the place to be?"" there's more than a touch of sarcasm in her query. At times the personal becomes political, and on ""Camouflage"", a darkly romantic duet with Robert Wyatt that took form over mail correspondence, the singer offers a skeptical stance on spirituality. Over a spooky, piano-based backdrop, she intertwines her vocals with Wyatt's to argue, ""Belief is just a camouflage for fear."" Combined with <em>BM</em>'s chilly sonic underpinnings, the lyrical content of these tracks might imply a coldness or detachment, but Morgenstern's desire here to examine both internal and social conflicts (not to mention the urgency of her singing and piano playing) suggest that she's as engaged as ever.¬†</p>
<p><em>BM</em>'s difficult instrumental pieces are no less adventurous than its electro- and piano-pop moments and contribute to the album's tendency, at times, to feel unnecessarily heady. Asymmetrical and vocal-less, ""My Velocity"" layers crashing piano noises with screeching guitars overtop an insistent digital drumbeat. It's the sort of conceptual number that fascinates me on first listen and then instantly dives into the never-listen-again section of my brain. Songs like this and others such as ""Hustefuchs"" that seek to frighten and confound make for an effort that swaps a good portion of its approachability for creative advancement. That's a trade-off that close followers of indie and electronic music are inclined to celebrate, even though (or perhaps because) it will scare away most of the general public. But <em>BM</em> is an album that even daring listeners will need to sit with for four, five listens before getting comfortable. In an age of vast, immediate file sharing and countless other options such as, I dunno, <em>Chinese Democracy</em>, it may not get its due.</p></div>"|12488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12488-bm/|7.8|Joe Colly

Sometimes they disappear because they're made to disappear. In the case of ra√Ø, Algeria's vibrant hybrid of Middle Eastern and European folk, its subject matter and party vibe often made the music a target in post-colonial Algeria, with former FLN fighter and later the nation's Marxist leader Houari Boum√©dienne not as huge a fan of free speech as he was of suppressing it. <br/><br/>Of course, ra√Ø never vanished. Every bit the people's music as much as punk or hip-hop, ra√Ø had flourished for decades before the government brought the hammer down-- and even then it merely moved underground; it's from those years that Sublime Frequencies' vinyl-only 1970's <em>Algerian Proto-Ra√Ø</em><em> Underground</em> compiles (thanks to Hicham Chadly) eight festive horn (and, in one case, electric guitar) adorned tracks from four Algerian acts.</p><p>These rough hewn recordings sound like they were surreptitiously recorded at some wedding or street party, full as they are of pounding percussion, bleating brass, humming organ or accordion, and full-throated Arabic vocals. Translations of the titles reveal a quotidian truth to the songs: Bellemou &amp; Benfissa's ""Li Maandouche L'Auto"", for example, translates roughly to ""He Who Doesn't Own a Car"" (it's about drunk driving, and features ""Father of Ra√Ø"" Messaoud Bellemou, whose L'Orchestre Bellemou updated many traditional Algerian melodies for modern ears). Boutaiba Sghir's ""Dayha Oulabes"" is perhaps more universally resonant as ""I'll Marry Her Whether They Like It or Not"", while Groupe El Azhar's ""Mazal Nesker Mazal"" becomes the remarkably descriptive ""I'm Still Getting Drunk...Still"". Cheb Zergui's ""Ana Dellali"" means, straightforwardly enough, ""I Cuddle Myself"". <br/><br/>The late-70s track ""Ana Dellali"" is the most striking track on the comp, given its psychedelic wah-wah guitar and dub-wise bass. The rest of the set is more slice of life. Culled from long-forgotten 45s, this collection plays like a snapshot of what one imagines might have been found performed in cabarets or blaring in a some backroom Oran jukebox when the long arm of the law was looking the other way. Given the subsequent global spread of ra√Ø and the international success of several bona fide ra√Ø stars, archivists, DJs and treasure hunters would be wise to dispatch their best vinyl hounds to the city forthright, in search of more gems likes these, just waiting to be dusted off and discovered anew.</p></div>"|12487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12487-1970s-algerian-proto-rai-underground/|7.5|Joshua Klein

And hip-hop aficionados, with their firm sense of place, tie Oakland to a unique style of rap that bears little resemblance to its famous counterpart in Los Angeles. The brightest lights of the Bay Area, E-40 and Too $hort, never fully bought into the dark, trigger-happy sensationalism of the Death Row artists: Guns simply weren't part of their vision of, or path to, the good life. Emphasizing the joy of letting loose, the hyphy movement that sprang up a few years ago only cemented the scene's drama-free outlook.</p><p>But Oakland's Restiform Bodies are agitators. And what better place for this hall of modest fame-- the indie-rap supergroup of Passage, Bomarr Monk, and Telephone Jim Jesus-- than Anticon? Their debut on the label,<em> TV Loves You Back</em>, presents a furious, righteous, and not entirely subtle dissatisfaction with capitalism. Thanks to the recent tumult in the world's markets, the album, like the DNC platform, has an added punch of timeliness. To be fair, mindless consumerism is more the target here than, say, overly leveraged banks. In short, the rappers mount their attack on low culture, not high finance.</p><p>""Consumer Culture Wave"" suggests a fight-the-Man mission with its title. Luckily, the song is better than that, too gloriously strange and oblique to be pressed into the service of jam-band leftism. (Love and gender seem to be the real subject, anyway.) Better to revel in the fluorescent textures and spastic rhythms, an accurate evocation of life in the attention-deficient multimedia slipstream, than to grope for political provocations in the lyrics. After all, it would have sufficed to attack QVC in only one song, you'd think. Docking too many points here isn't fair, anyway: Laid out on the page, even the best songs forfeit their essence. But when you spit nonsense with the apocalyptic ferocity of El-P, in many ways the hyperpolitical white rapper's template, that nonsense may as well be scripture.</p>
<p>Ever eager to disquiet, the Bodies even stoke the listener's anxieties about machines (on the sludgy, horror-string-laced ""Pick It Up, Drop It"") and modern medicine (""Ameriscan""). If there's a paranoid style in American hip-hop, this may be its purest expression. Nodding to the post-Thanksgiving virus that turns the lanes of Wal-Mart into the <em>Ben-Hur</em> chariot race, ""Black Friday"" bounces between drum'n'bass speed and trip-hop languor to manic-depressively link consumerism and domestic life. That the Bodies lean on everything from the New Romantics to crunk to post-rock to ghettotech to paint this cultural self-portrait only amplifies the strangeness-- and accuracy-- of <em>TV Loves You Back</em>.</p>
<p>""Movies are for entertainment,"" Louis B. Mayer famously stated. ""If you want to send a message, send a telegram."" The role of art isn't quite that narrow, of course, but the legendary producer knew that audiences didn't want to be lectured. And sadly that's what a lot of independent rap does. The Restiform Bodies avoid this. As Passage put it: ""All the information on <em>TV Loves You Back </em>is stuff I'm trying to make peace with as a person, and that I think we all have to make peace with as a society."" That sums up why the record is not only digestible, but outright luscious. We're not watching a presentation or reading a complaint. We're not being condemned for watching ""The Hills"". We're living, for a YouTube minute, inside three minds warped and wracked by our national addiction to the screen. It's equal parts unsightly and arresting in the way that most pathologies are.</p></div>"|12491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12491-tv-loves-you-back/|7.1|Roque Strew

After listening to their new live album <em>A Cross the Universe</em>-- and watching the hour-long tour documentary included with it-- I remain skeptical to this possibility: Maybe the photo's from one of their more disorganized sound checks, or maybe the plug just fell out on its own mid-set. The album gives the former impression, since they sound too dynamic and moment-to-moment to be a canned DAT fronted by a couple of pantomiming phonies. And the latter scenario seems likely after watching the documentary, which depicts Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Aug√© as a couple of disaster-courting goofballs flying by the seats of their pants-- drunk on America, beset by mishaps, and surrounded by lunatics. Of course cords are going to just fall out; everything else about Justice seems to go haywire from time to time.</p><p>So <em>A Cross the Universe</em> is a fairly interesting take on one of the more controversial electronic acts in years-- interesting, at least, if you're not entirely concerned with a vivid and rich-sounding document of their live show. The funny thing is, neither the album or the documentary portions of <em>A Cross the Universe</em> do the most ideal job of capturing their set, which seems like an intentional anti-hubris move on their part. Justice are still pretty novel, they're still relative outsiders, and they're still interested in being enigmatic-- what's there to do now that they're already pushing a live album right after their debut? So the documentary's all quick-cut behind-the-scenes hijinx with only brief flashes of actual live performance, while the album comes close to sounding like a straight-up low-budget bootleg.</p><p>The concert portion, recorded in San Francisco in March 2008, is a problem if you're not on board with the idea that the full, epic spectacle of a Justice show can be reduced to an audio quality that sounds slightly better than a YouTube clip. This was a deliberate choice, with the soundboard bypassed for a setup that simply placed several microphones on the stage. The result is an album that seems to be dominated as much by the audience as by the music. It makes for some exhilarating moments: ""We Are Your Friends (Reprise)"" is a perfect call-and-response, and the pops that accompany each moment of recognition give a few vicarious thrills; that first moment of apeshit glee when the Godzilla horns of ""Genesis"" crest over the horizon, quickly followed by an even bigger explosion when the first beat drops, is just about enough to justify the whole setup.</p>
<p>But with a fidelity that often reduces the cheering of the crowd to an enthusiastic-sounding static in the noisier moments and makes the notoriously midrange-happy material from <em>‚Ä† </em>sound even more abrasive, <em>A Cross the Universe </em>sacrifices a lot of listenability. Next to something like Daft Punk's <em>Alive 2007</em>-- which, amongst its many fine qualities, is a hell of a headphone album-- <em>A Cross the Universe</em> is all loudness and no warmth, and sometimes it gets almost unbearably grating; your first impulse while listening to a concert recording from an electronic dance music act shouldn't be to turn the volume <em>down.</em></p>
<p>But if you can ignore a recording ill-suited to handle the force of Justice's arena-sized sound, you'll at least get to hear them find interesting ways to reinvent and refresh their relatively sparse repertoire. Nearly 17 minutes of the set is devoted in some way or fashion to the two-part ""Phantom"" (which gets a ""Part 1.5"" for good measure here), and that mysterious intelligible vocoder hook gets dissected, diced-up, and redistributed over beats that are both more rubbery and more claustrophobically dense than the album version. ""D.A.N.C.E."" is even more radically altered, slowing to a crawl in its first half, then coming out with a more aggressive snarl behind it during the second-- just barely standing on the good side of the ""subvert/ruin"" line, trading its childlike euphoria for a teenage sneer. And if ""Stress"" sounded like a tense, suffocating hornet attack on <em>‚Ä†</em>, here it's changed into a more wide-open, airplane-hangar-sized anthem, its needling electronic strings transformed into full-fledged Bernard Herrmann-caliber orchestration.</p>
<p>The documentary DVD that comes packaged with the album, directed by music video creators Romain Gavras (""Stress"") and So-Me (""DVNO"", ""D.A.N.C.E.""),<span> doesn</span>'<span>t offer much for those interested in a live Justice show-- it</span>'<span>s mostly concerned with the crazy shit that happens to them between gigs: Gaspard has a Vegas wedding to a woman who disappears the next day, Xavier sings a thickly accented </span>""<span>Under the Bridge</span>""<span> to a very uncomfortable-looking Anthony Kiedis, their gun-obsessed tour manager takes them shooting, and all three of them get arrested at the end after Xavier clocks a belligerent, threatening drunk over the head with a bottle. (It also includes one of my new favorite music-doc moments of all time, where Gaspard and Xavier pose for photos with a couple Hooters waitresses as the Count Five</span>'<span>s </span>""<span>Psychotic Reaction</span>""<span> chugs away in the background. The waitresses are all smiles; Justice couldn</span>'<span>t look more disconnected and bored with their surroundings.) What few glimpses there are of their concerts are brief, quickly-cut</span>-- <span>and, like the album, largely focused on picking up the audience reactions. <em>A Cross the Universe </em>isn</span>'<span>t close to anyone</span>'<span>s definitive idea of what a document of a live Justice show should be, but it</span>'<span>s a diverting, sometimes-bizarre look into the first phase of fame for an aughts-era cult pop phenomenon. </span></p></div>"|12493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12493-a-cross-the-universe/|6.5|Nate Patrin

This year alone has seen a full-length by his band Sun Kil Moon, which was packaged with a bonus disc of alternate takes; an LP of live and alternate takes that accompanied the U.S. publication of his book of lyrics; a live EP that came free with purchase at his online store; and finally a covers album. Rather than flood the market or dilute the quality of his output, these releases suggest Kozelek tinkers with his own and others' compositions continuously. In this regard, he's certainly no stranger to the covers album: His first solo release was 2000's <em>Rock 'N' Roll Singer,</em> which included songs by AC/DC and John Denver, and he has since released full-lengths fully devoted to AC/DC and Modest Mouse. But <em>The Finally LP</em> is something a bit different even for him: a record of lovely instrumentals and covers of tracks from tribute and benefit albums.<br><br><em>Finally</em> may be LP length but it lacks an album's cohesiveness. There's no big statement here, at least not like there was with <em>April</em>, his second album with Sun Kil Moon. However, the looseness of the tracklist allows him to indulge some punishing metal riffs and howling emo madman vocals. Yeah, right. Kozelek is the king of somber and of course gives these covers his signature reading: slow, melancholy, full of stoic vocals and steady, shimmery guitar. This solemn take doesn't work against the LP, but in its favor. <em>The Finally LP</em> is Kozelek's own tribute of sorts, a nod to his array of idols and influences.<br><br>The title comes from a song by folk singer Kath Bloom, who has experienced a resurgence of sorts in the past two years. Kozelek covered the song for <em>Loving Takes Its Course: A Tribute to the Songs of Kath Bloom</em>, out next year on her Australian label, Chapter Music. He gives it a tension that wasn't present in the original: Bloom's version was as much a valedictory as the title suggests, but for Kozelek, there are no promises in catharsis and no conclusion in the song. Such dourness, while not unexpected, has always threatened to become Kozelek's default mode, but here his curiously pessimistic interpretation sounds raw and wounded, as if he hasn't yet shaken off the darkness of whatever is finally coming to and end. His ruminative reading of ""New Partner"", from the 2006 comp <em>I Am a Cold Rock, I Am Dull Grass: A Tribute to Will Oldham</em>, develops that theme and storyline, creating an intriguing diptych about loss and renewal.<br><br>This is an album of transitions. The segue from ""Finally"" into ""New Partner"" gives both songs more impact than they might have otherwise, as does ""Bedtime Lullaby"" into ""Celebrated Summer"". ""Lullaby"" was recorded for an episode of <em>Yo Gabba Gabba!</em>, and this song, along with dancing Nathaniel and <a href=""http://www.yogabbagabba.com/#/biz-video-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>a beatboxing lesson from Biz Markie</strong></a>, would argue that it might just be the greatest show ever. If some listeners claim that Kozelek puts them to sleep, he has responded with a song specifically designed to put listeners to sleep. Written by the show's Jarond Gibbs, it makes for a sweet lullaby and leads in nicely to Kozelek's cover of H√ºsker D√º's ""Celebrated Summer"", which he slows down to great effect, playing up wistful memories of youth like an adult's lullaby.<br><br>He's less successful with his cover of Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", off the charity comp <em>Musicians for Minneapolis: 57 Songs for the I-35 Bridge Disaster Relief Fund</em>. Kozelek grafts an effective descending acoustic riff onto the chorus and adds a slight lilt to the melody, but it's still ""Send in the Clowns"". Low's ""Lazy"" fares better, as Kozelek's voice cracks just enough to convey a strong sense of yearning. His delivery lends added gravity to ""My Friend Bob"", by Dom Leone (not Pitchfork's Dominique Leone, but the late songwriter for Ed's Redeeming Qualities), although his cover of AC/DC's ""If You Want Blood"", recorded for Lisbon radio, isn't appreciably different from the version that appeared on <em>What's Next to the Moon</em>. There's a hodgepodge quality to <em>The Finally LP</em>, but like his recent EPs, bonus discs, and live collections, it proves another essential non-essential.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|12492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12492-the-finally-lp/|7.3|Stephen M.

To these ears, <em>Earthquake Glue</em> has always seemed like a bloated, proggy  affair frontloaded with a few winners but bogged down by a glut of unsteady  melodies, unshapely guitars, and hooks that never quite come around. These markers have followed Pollard to varying degrees  ever since, and last year's one-two punch of <em>Standard Gargoyle Decisions</em> and <em>Coast to Coast Carpet of Love</em> was the nadir of  that particular style: the simultaneous release of two gangly records didn't work for Springsteen or Elvis Costello, and it sure as  hell wasn't about to restore ever-shakier faith in the fate of our Fading  Captain.</p><p>In 2008, Pollard seemed to free himself from the <em>Earthquake Glue </em>muck.  Could be that raiding the archives in preparation for January's enjoyably  stupid ""old songs, new parts"" curio <em>Superman Was a Rocker</em> reminded the dude of what's been missing, but whatever's gotten into  him lately will hopefully stick around. This summer's <em>Robert Pollard  is Off to Business</em> stands as his most tuneful offering since the last  GBV album proper; sure, it leaned a little closer toward the ""Hold  on Hope"" schmaltz than, say, the weird poignance of ""The Goldheart  Mountaintop Queen Directory"", but you came away from the disc remembering  what you'd heard. It had been far too long since he's sustained that  over the course of an LP.</p><p>And now-- and, apparently, for the  foreseeable future-- we have the Boston Spaceships, which even Pollard's calling the ""new band."" With long-distance  contributions by his Takeovers partner Chris Slusarenko and Decemberists  drummer John Moen, Pollard has crafted his liveliest set since late-period  GBV banger <em>Universal Truths and Cycles</em>. He's also got a band about as well-suited to his strengths as any he's held  since the Tobin ""Due for a Reappraisal"" Sprout days. Moen's  got a steady hand or two and a young(er) man's urge to push the  songs forward. And Slusarenko and Pollard go back to the last days of  GBV, a period that saw that band's simple, stately side occasionally bogged  down by the showy (in Pollardworld, that's code for ""infallibly  competent"") playing of Doug Gillard.</p>
<p>And <em>Brown Submarine</em> is not a showy record. Matching easy Cheap Trick melodies with a  slightly sharpened take on his usual logorrhea, the tunes on <em>Brown Submarine</em> go straight for the raised fist and the open heart. With its longer songs, varied textures, and reasonably hi-fi sound, it's a record on the cusp of cohesion with only a modicum of his typical hijinks. If  the past few years saw Pollard working through a hyperprolific and confused period, all seems startlingly crystalline here: <em>Brown Submarine</em> is a four-on-the-floor, prefix-optional  rock'n'roll record that, unlike virtually all of his recent work save  <em>Off to Business</em>, requires no prior investment in Pollard to be worth your  coin.</p>
<p>Bummer that it kicks  off with a bit of a non-starter: ""Winston's Atomic Bird"" is  pretty much the chunky stuff of old, built around an acrid hook  and the same kind of buildup to nowhere on which those <em>Earthquake Glue</em> tracks relived so heavily. The mercifully short title track does a little  better, matching an intentionally dumb lyric with a nifty little guitar  turnaround. But ""You Satisfy Me"" does what its title promises,  and heartily so; and from there on, Pollard's on a roll, kicking  out jam after snappy little jam imbued with genuine urgency and lingering  melodic notions. The rockers, you know, rock: ""Ate It Twice""  is a pretty good little punk skiffle, and ""Rat Trap"" clamps  down from the onset and doesn't let up long enough to either make sense  or get stale. And the ballads, though notably a bit dusty in melodic  terms, get over on feeling. The line in ""Two Girl Area"" about  Axl Rose will almost certainly run a little deeper through you than  anything on <em>Chinese Democracy</em> will, and album highlight (and closer)  ""Go For the Exit"" stands as one of the maybe two dozen most  memorable songs in Pollard's catalog.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Pollard's still as inscrutable  and frequently unmemorable as ever-- ""you you you you satisfy me""  and the Axl quip are the most direct things he says over 35  minutes. But after the oft-embarrassing drunk talk that populates recent  records like the aforementioned <em>Superman</em> and the Circus Devils' gnarly  <em>Sgt. Disco</em>, the relative clarity of vision in Pollard's words seem to  match that of his new band's. Plus, if you're this deep into a review  of a Bob Pollard record, you know damn well you don't listen to the  man to pore over the words.</p>
<p>If there's a bone to be picked with the current direction, it's that <em>Brown Submarine </em>like <em>Off to  Business</em>, is but a single victory in a larger battle against complacency;  the book remains written largely as before, with a few necessarily but  hardly radical revisions. The faster stuff is pretty much in line with  the key tracks from <em>Mag Earwhig!</em>, and the lesser of the slow jams could  very well be on any of the records after <em>Do the Collapse</em>. But in paring  down many of the eccentricities that bogged down a lot of the post-GBV  work and finding a couple dudes who obviously love and understand what's  made Pollard worth the frustrated adulation in the past, they're firing  on nearly as many cylinders as anytime since  GBV's mid-to-late 90s heyday. If these Spaceships of Pollard's keep killing  it live and putting out records worth hearing straight through-- the  next one's already due in January--¬† they can cherry-pick from  the best bits from the past all they want.¬†</p></div>"|12490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12490-brown-submarine/|7.1|Paul Thompson

The man's recordings abound in little innovations, both sonic and lyrical, and if <em>Everything/Everything</em> sounds particularly heavy on them, that's no coincidence: the record, a self-described ""big band song cycle,"" deals with the onslaught of information in this modern age.</p><p>Accordingly, the music on <em>Everything</em> runs the gamut, with touches of kraut/motorik (""Portrait of the Artist as a Fountain"") and Gang of Four-descended post-punk (""Alsatian Dog"") rubbing up against plenty of Reich/Glass modular flourishes (a good two-thirds of the tracks) and even a splash of the baroque (""Il Trionfo del Tempo...[Ridley Road]""). Much has been made of Bookish's decision to eschew the electronic instrumentation that dominated his first two albums-- 2006's aggro-electro opus <em>Unfair/Funfair</em> and 2007's frequently brilliant if uneven <em>Trainwreck/Raincheck</em>-- in favor of the more organic sounds of the pianos, saxophones, Farfisa organs, harps, and chirpy brass section that color <em>Everything</em>. By and large Bookish employs his new toys to good effect: the polyphony of voice, backing chorus, piano, and brass during the refrain of opening track ""The Flood"" sounds positively euphoric, while ""Synchrotron"" drops thick, excited sax over rolling piano and a bed of Stereolab-like Farfisa to emerge as one of the record's highlights.</p><p>This kitchen-sink musical approach makes sense in light of the subject matter, which, while it might not encompass <em>everything</em>, sure comes close. ""Carbon"" builds a chorus out of Albert Einstein's apparent words to Buckminster Fuller-- ""Young man, you amaze me!""-- tucked between imagery of various forms of the life-giving element. ""A Crack in Larsen C"" uses a disintegrating ice shelf as a springboard for a moody meditation on end times (""Will the future crash in the next five minutes/ And if it does, will we be burning or frozen?""), while ""Victorinox"" has Bookish seemingly commenting on the Swiss policy of neutrality one moment (""Try to ignore the drum sound...the place where you live is under attack"") and delighting in wordplay (""Monstrous animosity/ Rhinoceros of animus"") the next. Astronomy, television culture, publishing, oceanology, particle physics, and the evolution of language come into play as well, as do such fun vocab words as ""apogee,"" ""damask,"" and ""meniscus."" If this all sounds a little overwhelming, well, that's the point.</p>
<p><em>Everything</em>'s one shortcoming is that it can occasionally feel cold and clinical, a feeling underscored by Bookish's authoritative baritone. That voice was slightly better suited to the stream-of-consciousness spoken word narratives on <em>Trainwreck/Raincheck</em> and the more sadomasochistic moments of <em>Unfair/Funfair</em> than to these avant-pop ditties. And despite Bookish's newfound penchant for pop song structures, his music still isn't nearly as accessible as that of fellow classically-trained tunesmiths Patrick Wolf and Owen Pallett/Final Fantasy-- which may explain his lower profile among fans of orchestral indie pop.</p>
<p>And although it's unfocused by design, <em>Everything</em> is still unfocused. Which is not to say it's inconsistent: a major improvement in this regard over <em>Trainwreck</em>-- which meandered off into ambient oblivion on its final four tracks-- <em>Everything</em> is markedly well assembled. Its mellower material (""Il Trionfo"", ""Larsen C"") is deftly sequenced amid its peppier numbers, and ""The Flood"" and closing track ""Colophon"" serve as fine bookends for the whole concept. Indeed, it's the confusion and ambivalence that proceeds it that allows Bookish's final declaration on that closing track to ring loud and clear: ""Not too late to rewrite history/ Not too late to save ourselves/ Not too late to pull this species above, beyond."" Ultimately we're left with something not unlike the age it addresses: easily marveled at, not always so easily engaged with, and yet with much to offer to those willing to make the effort.</p></div>"|12480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12480-everythingeverything/|7.7|Matthew Solarski

While those cuts are merely underwhelming and escapist, their more in-your-face retro tracks reek of posturing: ""Coors Lite"" and ""B.N.E."" are convinced there's still a Jet fan inside each of us. ""B.N.E."", with its bluesy chorus of ""She wants a brand new everything,"" gets wise to this whole superficial, materialistic SoCal culture-- an observation that's been made in like a hundred jagillion (I checked) works of art in the last century.<br/><br/>The rest of the album wades in even safer and more comfortable waters. You could peg ballads ""Oh Brother"" or ""Misery &amp; Profits"" as doo-wop nostalgia channeled through T. Rex, but the band's beach-bum work ethic can't muster the energy to pull off glam. It's a double-edged sword, because while the band's lazy minimalism deprives them of possessing any real strengths, it at least prevents any Louis XIV-sized missteps. The debut's boring, not awful, but until the band stops sounding like they have a hundred cooler things to do than be in a studio, it's hard to imagine them as anything more than surf muzak.</p></div>"|12486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12486-japanese-motors/|3.8|Adam Moerder

For Rivers Cuomo, there naturally was plenty of interest. Thankfully, <em>Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo</em>-- the follow-up to last year's <em>Alone</em>-- is nearly as good as the earlier volume: There's less deep-vault revelation this time around but there's more variety in style and sound.</p><p>Bad news first: Despite a flashy guitar solo and some laborious harmonies, ""I Want to Take You Home Tonight"" plods, and ""The Prettiest Girl in the Whole Wide World"" would have been better left in the garage. <em>Alone </em>had its silly spots, for sure, but they at least revealed a lot of Cuomo's personality and charm. There's not a lot of replay value in marching-band interludes and song snippets played into answering machines, and while covers are fun, the Beach Boys' ""Don't Worry Baby"" is a choice and an arrangement that will surprise no one, ably performed or not.</p><p>The best <em>Alone II</em> offers is straight-ahead, no-nonsense power-pop-- not that anyone's ever complained about that from Cuomo. ""My Brain Is Working Overtime"" joyously rides a scant few chords into the ground, ""Walt Disney"" sparkles gently but confidently, and ""I'll Think About You"" is a staccato acoustic jig with Cuomo sounding, for once, relaxed. More pieces from ""lost album"" <em>Songs From the Black Hole</em> are revealed yet again with a full-blown song suite: Longing ballad ""Oh Jonas"" features some vocal schizophrenia, which segues into the lurching ""Please Remember"", and ends on the playful and slightly-seedy ""Come to My Pod"". All of them are goofy, off-the-cuff, and charming.</p>
<p>Bleeding-heart Weezer fans will still find at least a few tracks to pin their fond memories on. ""The Purification of Water"", a strident Blue Album-worthy ballad, pins familiar low-end riffery on some Hammond-esque organ. ""I Don't Want You Let to Go"" has lovely acoustic instrumentation, and even the maudlin piano bitch-out to critics, ""My Day Is Coming"", is believably wounded. Any of these would fit onto any of their records with a little more time and attention, but the instrumentation and faux-Romantic lyrics of ""The Purification of Water"" is the only one that distinguishes itself in this early form.</p>
<p>The novelty acoustic rap cover might be the most odious trend of my generation, but previously-unreleased track ""Can't Stop Partying"" subtly bucks the trend. A lack of irony doesn't make it less awkward, but it's certainly more palatable: it's a collaboration with Jermaine Dupri, for one, has an oddly striking melody (even if it's a little close to Smashing Pumpkins' ""Disarm"" for comfort), and made slightly more interesting in a sad-libertine sort of way for a mournful tone behind it's party-ready lyrics.<br/><br/>""Can't Stop Partying"" doesn't sound awkward from Cuomo, necessarily-- but it does sound heavily labored. Cuomo isn't the type of artist to wait around for divine inspiration-- he's a worker, songwriting is his job-- but as we get deeper into the vaults, more of the material sounds like actual <em>work</em>, or daily exercises without a spark of fun or unpredictability (outside of a woebegotten space-themed rock opera, of course). <em>Alone</em> was worth the occasional cringe to show Cuomo's experiments and sonic baby photos through the years, especially after three studiously formulaic records. The weird part is that, after the Red Album, Cuomo's day job is actually more unpredictable than these demos-- for better or for worse.</p></div>"|12507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12507-alone-ii-the-home-recordings-of-rivers-cuomo/|6.0|Jason Crock

They're not much more than a nice way to expose the little one to ""Kashmir"" and ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Heart-Shaped Box"" without scaring the shit out of him-- and to keep mom and dad from losing their heads listening to interminable nursery rhymes. My sis asked me to grab a few more in the series as stocking stuffers, but I think I might just surprise her with Cat Power's new EP, <em>Dark End of the Street</em>, instead.</p><p>Aside from the fact that the nominal Chan Marshall actually does sing on these six covers of songs made famous by the likes of Aretha Franklin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and the Pogues, there's not a whole lot of difference between the somnambulistic effects of this EP and the <em>Rockabye Baby!</em> records. In their original, raw form, Aretha's voice or CCR's guitars or really anything relating to Shane MacGowan could easily upset a newborn, but Marshall has smoothed over those upsetting displays of passion and personality with sleepy readings that transform all the material into one never-ending narcoleptic haze.</p><p>These six cuts were apparently deemed unworthy of inclusion on <em>Jukebox</em>, Cat Power's covers LP released earlier this year, which wasn't terribly impressive itself, aside from a nice gender twist on Hank Williams' ""Ramblin' Man"" and a fascinatingly vulnerable fan letter to Bob Dylan, ""Song to Bobby"". Of course, it wasn't always this way, as a listen to Marshall's 2000 effort <em>The Covers Record</em> strongly attests to her interpretative capabilities, yet ever since restyling herself as a weary soulstress for the jaded indie rock set, she's too often allowed her material to coast on the twin strengths of her tastefully muscular backing bands and her own invariably smoky vocal tone.</p>
<p>Marshall deserves some credit for having the stones to tackle such unimpeachable classics as Franklin's ""It Ain't Fair"", Otis Redding's ""I've Been Loving You To Long (To Stop Now)"", and the title track (famously recorded by Franklin, James Carr, and the Flying Burrito Brothers). Yet her own versions aim at some druggily evocative conception of 60s soul, which makes them pale next to the originals. Marshall fares markedly better with the non-soul stuff-- her take on CCR's ""Fortunate Son"" is commendable, casting the song in an entirely different rhythmic setting that lends it a swaggering insistence even at low volume. As for the EP's other two offerings, a quick search of YouTube yields two superior renditions of ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"" (Sandy Denny's original and Nina Simone's cover) and at least three better takes on ""Ye Auld Triangle"" (from the Pogues, Dropkick Murphys, and especially a mesmeric run-through by Marshall's beloved Bob Dylan and the Band from the never-officially-released trove of <em>Basement Tapes</em> recordings).</p>
<p>Still, if it's any consolation, I bet the baby will prefer Cat Power's versions.</p></div>"|12504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12504-dark-end-of-the-street-ep/|3.8|Joshua Love

On that record, he managed to locate a middle ground between Balkan folk, Byzantine religious music, and the breakbeats rattling the trunks of his native Santa Fe. His aesthetic worked best at its extremes: the jittery beats of ""Balkan Lowrider Anthem"" at one pole, the hazy ""Lovely Lovely Love"" at the other. The middle range was pretty but equivocal, and Bethancourt came off like a talented pop musician slightly embarrassed by pop.</p><p>But whatever obscurity prevailed upon <em>Dance Party in the Balkans</em> disperses on <em>Holiday</em>. It's a collection of chromed synth hymns aimed straight at your pleasure centers, with zero concessions to so-called difficulty. ""Berlin"" announces Bethancourt's newfound clarity and the place that fostered it (he spent six months making the album there): the synths are torqued into gleaming waves, the bassline is glued to the one-beat, and thwacking snares keep dropping in and out so we can relish the surge over and over.</p><p>The Berlin microsound infiltrates the album only slightly; mostly, it's dominated by slabby 4/4 anthems. The locale's direct influence is more practical-- since Bethancourt had no instruments with him, his use of programmed synths and drums was compulsory. Because things like ukulele and vocals by Trost were added later, they never derail the rock-solid foundations as they sometimes did on the first album. Even the slightest song here, the ambivalently shuffling ""Knorrpromenade"", packs almost as much wallop as <em>Dance Party</em>'s most emphatic moments.</p>
<p>If Bethancourt's musical style is considerably refined on <em>Holiday</em>, his voice remains its centerpiece. He's still a dead ringer for Condon, although the minimization of folksy idioms helps him forge a more distinct identity of his own. He rolls out chorus after wafting chorus, harmonizing with his natural voice through a vocoder, thereby lending it a serrated edge. These are the kinds of songs that are impossible to sing without your eyes prayerfully closed, and Bethancourt's earnestness helps to sell his goofy lyrics about speed boats to heaven (on the splashy electro-pop nursery rhyme of the same name, an album highlight) and girls dying in his arms (on the percolating-then-gushing ""Highlander Pt. 1"", a hammy tragi-romantic duet with Trost).</p>
<p>Bethancourt likes to establish punchy patterns and flog them for all they're worth. The second part of ""Highlander"" brings in a new lyrical motif-- ""I don't want to live forever,"" he sings, rising and falling over each word-- but mostly sticks to reshuffling the scudding bass line, fizzy snares, and synth loops of its predecessor. The first two parts of ""Streetgang"" tinker with a buzzy theme that gains a powerful thrust with the introduction of trills and glossy chords in the song's third part. You can feel Bethancourt's enthusiasm, how he likes the parts so much he wants to see how they fit together in every possible permutation. Given the seductive simplicity of his loops, that enthusiasm is easy to share.</p>
<p><em>Holiday</em> would be a fine album at any moment, but it seems especially timely right now. Let's take a quick inventory: The contours are stark and sleek, and it burns with a weirdly cold heat. The production is elaborate in a streamlined way, the melodies infectious. A sentimental digi-crooner is orbited by hums and blips, as if rendering your voice and music robotic gives you carte blanche to be messily human, even maudlin. Sound familiar? Suddenly, and just in time for the holidays, it's as if indie pop fans immune to the charms of Kanye West have an <em>808's and Heartbreak</em> of their very own.¬†</p></div>"|12494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12494-holiday/|7.8|Brian Howe

Hush Arbors, a duo consisting of songwriter Keith Wood (contributor to records by Current 93 and Six Organs Of Admittance, along with many others) and his long-time collaborator Leon Dufficy, have actually been performing a lot longer than any of those acts-- almost a decade, in fact. So it's an ironic yet familiar tale that this recent wave of new music might help bring them belated attention. For those who haven't yet heard the band's delicate, experimental free-folk compositions, <em>Hush Arbors</em> is a great place to start and adroitly encompasses all of the Virginia based duo's most engaging qualities.</p><p>While the mostly instrumental opening track of <em>Hush Arbors</em>, ""Water"", does little to prepare the listener for what to expect from the rest of the album, it makes for a startling introduction. The barrage of ultra-fuzzed guitar drone provides a stylistic link to earlier releases, such as their 3"" CD-R <em>Cleaning the Bone</em> from 2005, and actually serves as a sonic cleanser of sorts. When the rivers of feedback fade, the music suddenly lifts and a common thread begins to unfold. There's a lot of gorgeous acoustic fingerpicking that promptly brings Bert Jansch to mind, although this is occasionally balanced by the electric guitar textures of Wood's pal in Six Organs of Admittance, Ben Chasny. On ""Follow Closely"", Chasny's barbed guitar lines actually highlight the character of the songwriting while bringing the vivid imagery of Wood's lyrics to life when he sings ""It came swimming swiftly through her eyes and touched me gently, a double flame grew around her head/ She flicked her tongue and she kissed me on the lips, and I felt it burn, I felt it burn.""</p><p>Stark and contemplative, ""Rue Hollow"" is the only track on the album to stick to acoustic guitar alone, and is outstanding due to its elegant simplicity. Wood has the unmistakable vocal inflections and sorrowful yet hopeful cadences of Mazzy Star on this song. Stringing falsetto across a carefully layered, circular guitar line, it is all the more impressive for being unembellished by other instrumentation. Wood clearly has a keen ear for knowing when to hold back and when to expand the possibilities of the song. ""Sand"" is one of the most melodically developed tracks on <em>Hush Arbors</em>, and despite sticking to a fairly liner dynamic, the hushed, slow burn of delayed guitar hovering in the background like a string quartet gives movement to the music and grounds other melodic ideas as they shift in and out of the verses with contrasting shades.</p>
<p>Taking a full circle of sorts, the album closes with ""Water II"". There's a return to the dark, even hallucinogenic, sea of distortion that introduces the first track, but this time it's pierced with a rough, swirling riff that sounds as though it could overthrow everything going on around it. On this song, Wood gradually ties in the themes that have colored the album lyrically. Water, mountains, light, and mysterious women give weight to every track, brought to life by the ethereal, unpredictable cascade of sounds that take their place among them.</p></div>"|12524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12524-hush-arbors/|7.5|Mia Lily Clarke

David ""Moose"" Adamson, who's been playing around the Hoosier State in various guises for a few years, has turned his affinity for the fallen King of Pop into ""I Will Save Young Michael"", which he's placed at the center of <em>Ropechain</em>, his first album for Indianapolis indie Asthmatic Kitty. ""I know for a fact that you're from Indiana, and so am I. So that makes us brothers,"" he intones in the song's spoken-word outro. Then, his appeal: ""You gotta come back, and dance again, like you used to. Okay? Okay. Good."" Made all the more hopeful by its harmless dopiness-- as a geographically-informed ode to a troubled soul, ""Michael"" sounds like it was written by Sufjan Stevens' dumb-jock older brother after he heard his sibling's ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr.""-- Adamson's plea marks the highpoint of <em>Ropechain</em>'s humanity.</p><p>The rest of the time, it's druggie sentimentality like that of ""You Will Love My Room"": ""I took mushrooms and then proposed to you."" The name Grampall Jookabox itself suggests someone emotionally and creatively frozen as a 19-year old after a Reddi-wip huff, and though Adamson tries the David Thomas/Captain Beefheart unhinged soul-shouter approach on ""Room"", the song registers as a charmless, macho <em>God Ween Satan</em> outtake. ""Black Girls"", which flits through nonsensical utterances like ""black girls build skyscrapers with their brains"" and ""Betty Davis‚Ä¶the black Bette Davis"", is doofy and exploitative, and ""The Girl Ain't Preggers"" exudes the empathy of a checkout-line tabloid headline. The tweaker folk-psych goof ""The One Thing"" affirms most clearly that Adamson doesn't have much to say: Like that one guy senior year who preferred Xanax and Beam cocktails, Adamson repeats the titular phrase without ever telling us what that thing exactly is, let alone why it's worth writing a song about. I imagine him falling asleep sitting up while singing the hook <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p><p>Yet despite its many faults, <em>Ropechain</em> is a hard record to hate: ""Thing"" has a solid groove, and the ridiculous, pointless lyrics of ""Black Girls"" only draw attention away from the tight, chirpy backmasked loop spinning out over a bleak, funky industrial bed, which made me type ""Anticonye West"" in my notes. Good ideas lurk throughout the album, but they either disappear under the weight of too much echo and overdubbing, or get pushed aside as a result of what I'd imagine is either a lack of discipline or dissenting voice during the creative process. Appropriately, ""Let's Go Mad Together""-- a kitschy, fun sci-fi choogle during which Adamson attempts scat-singing but achieves a boorish stutter-- sounds like the desperate product of being alone for too long, perhaps near a MacBook and GarageBand.</p>
<p>Partially because Indiana recently turned blue for the first time in 44 years, I feel less fucked than ever at the moment. But <em>Ropechain</em>'s brief bit of chirpy stoner paranoia ""We Know We Might Be Fucked"", and the back-porch-jam nihilism of ""I'm Absolutely Freaked Out"", dredge up more personal, and less pleasant memories for me. They're occasionally catchy, and certainly harmless enough, but they also make plain Adamson's intermittent attention span and dearth of insight, which makes me uneasy (and not in the fun way).¬† <em>Ropechain</em> isn't going to displace Margot &amp; the Nuclear So-and-Sos as the standard-bearers for Indie-ana any time soon (though please, someone hurry up and do it), but the album can stake a claim to represent that ever-underrepresented subculture that the nineteenth state owns as well as the other 49: Fidgety suburban druggies.</p></div>"|12481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12481-ropechain/|5.4|Eric Harvey

That is the question. Well, that is <em>a</em> question. And Brandon Flowers' grammatically dubious query gets to the heart of the Killers Dilemma. Emotion or libido? Imperfect or impervious? Vegas losers or comped penthouse playboys? On ""Mr. Brightside"", they didn't have to worry about such binaries. Fresh, young and hammy, one of the strengths of the Killers' 2004 debut, <em>Hot Fuss</em>, was its unlearned pop bent. It was fizzy and silly, and there were no apologies. Then <em>Sam's Town</em> checked off almost every big time follow-up clich√© there is: horn arrangements in place of songs, concept in place of lyrics, seriousness in place of nonchalance. If the makers of ""Gossip Girl"" created an HBO mini-series chronicling Dust Bowl despair, it would look like what <em>Sam's Town</em> sounds like. <br/><br/>Album number three tries to split the difference. There are funk basslines that recall 1980s Bowie and producer Stuart Price (Jacques Lu Cont)-- who helmed Madonna's return-to-dance record <em>Hung Up</em>-- was brought in. But the songs still take on sweeping, Springsteen-ian stakes, and first single ""Human"", with its high-gloss finish, is one of only a few tracks any flesh and blood being would consider dancing to. Which brings us back to that initial question: human or dancer? According to <em>Day &amp; Age</em>, the answer may be neither.<br/><br/>Across the album, Flowers keeps himself above the fray, never wallowing too much in his own drama. There's the self-reflexive detachment of ""Human"", the holier-than-thou scoffing on opener ""Losing Touch"" (""I'm in no hurry, you go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch""), and, on ""Spaceman"", he actually leaves our planet for a spell with the help of an alien. The pose suggests a newfound sophistication-- no longer shall he be a slave to the petty desires of mere earthlings. Most traces of humanness on <em>Day &amp; Age</em> come off oddly second-hand, as if Flowers uploaded Springsteen's or Bowie's catalogue to his internal memory and spat out a working simulacrum. This isn't all bad. <br/><br/>On both ""Losing Touch"" and ""Spaceman"" Flowers pulls off fine recreations of Pompadour- and Ziggy-era Bowie, respectively. But something like ""A Dustland Fairytale"" is the nonsensical result of a Big Rock magnetic poetry kit. ""Out where the dreams are high, out where the wind don't blow/ Out here, the good girls die and the sky won't snow,"" sings Flowers, signifying everything but saying nothing. Similarly, ""This Is Your Life"" attempts to conflate stories from a couple Springsteen tunes-- take the title character of ""Candy's Room"" and put her out on the savage ""Jungleland"" streets-- and comes off like a half-hearted tribute. With his long distance relationship with down-to-earth emotions and his previous penchant for fake-looking facial hair, Flowers can be reminiscent of a latter-day Rivers Cuomo-- a weirdo trying to please himself and his audience at the same time but constantly coming up a little short on at least half of that equation.<br/><br/>The other three guys in the Killers have taken all that <em>Sam's Town</em> criticism to heart more than their lead singer. On <em>Day &amp; Age</em>, the experimentalism is more scattered and more rewarding. Instead of just pressing the ""huge and bombastic"" button <em>ad nauseum</em>, they diversify: so there's the comically Caribbean ""Joyride"" (with full-on touristy sax solo), the Strokes-gone-samba of ""I Can't Stay"" and the impressively brooding (and Bj√∂rk-ish!) closer, ""Goodnight, Travel Well"". They're aiming to please some of the time, and they do. Less radical change-ups ""Losing Touch"" and ""Spaceman"" are the most obvious contenders for the inevitably incredible greatest hits compilation. ""Losing Touch"", in particular, is like a best of the Killers mashup: there's the crash cymbal chorus for fist-raising, the horn-strut verse for hip sliding, the  ""Guitar Hero""-ready solo from underused ax man Dave Keuning. <br/><br/>There's no central concept here-- even the album's title is as vaguely all-encompassing as possible. This is the Killers' spitball album, the one where they try everything and see what works while Flowers grasps for a relatable tone. ""When your chips are down, when your highs are low: joyride!"" he sings on the so-dizzy-it's-amazing ""Joyride"". It's the Killers at their most carefree-- the brooding behind them, they're ready to set out with the top down and the schmaltzy sax way, way up. Frivolity suits them, why shy away from it?</p></div>"|12505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12505-day-age/|5.9|Ryan Dombal

His creaky voice conveys innocence, but it also feels wise and nostalgic, as if its fault lines developed over centuries. That's why, in his mid-twenties, Young could get away with singing that he was a lot like an old man-- it sure sounded like the truth. On most of Young's recordings, the balance between age and youth skews toward the former. He experienced so much so early-- reaching success at age 21 with Buffalo Springfield, then quickly launching a prolific solo career-- that wisdom was branded on him immediately. By the time people even knew who Young was, he sounded more like a wily veteran than a green youngster.</p><p><em>Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968 </em>offers a chance to hear Young with the scales tipped the other direction. It's taken from his first two post-Buffalo Springfield solo acoustic concerts, performed in a ministry on the University of Michigan campus. Unheard until now, these shows have gained legend due to one song from them, ""Sugar Mountain"", popping up on B-sides and the <em>Decade </em>compilation. Made just weeks before the release of his self-titled debut and only a few days short of his 23rd birthday, this recording<em> </em>reveals an eager, nervous version of Young-- a version that existed briefly, soon gone in the flash of his subsequent solo success.</p><p>Not that he was uncomfortable on stage. Young had played to bigger crowds as part of Buffalo Springfield, whose success he gently mocks in between songs, scoffing at their huge amps and, as he puts it, ""ra-ta-ta-ta"" stage act. But he had yet to prove himself alone, and the weight of a public solo debut adds a little more quiver to his voice, a little more self-deprecation to his rambling stories.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In fact, Young was reportedly terrified, in part because he feared he didn't have enough material to sustain a full performance. Of the 13 songs included here, nearly half were previously recorded with Buffalo Springfield. To compensate, Young fills each gap with jittery, candid banter. ""Nothing I say up here is a lie,"" he claims with a stutter. ""I never ever have told a lie onstage."" His true stories are consistently endearing, covering everything from taking ""diet pills"" to get through his previous life as a bookstore clerk, to writing Buffalo Springfield songs while stuck at a diner at 4 a.m., to learning what residuals are and buying a classic car with them.</span></strong></p>
<p>The songs on <em>Sugar Mountain </em>are delivered with similar earnestness and vulnerability. After an introducer admits that the audience is larger than expected, Young offers a fragile version of ""On the Way Home"", his timid chords and cracking voice besting the speedier version found on the final Buffalo Springfield album, <em>Last Time Around</em>. Later, he sings ""The Loner"" in a bashful near-whisper, and the delicate guitar of ""If I Could Have Her Tonight"" alternates between approach and retreat. As things progress, Young's confidence grows, culminating in the ""The Old Laughing Lady"", which hits a rushing peak of forceful strums.</p>
<p>Musically, <em>Sugar Mountain </em>isn't Young's best live solo album. On that count, it's outshined by another recent archival release, the <em>Massey Hall</em> performance that happened three years later, and sounds much bolder and wider-ranging. But as a portrait of this ageless artist as a truly young man, <em>Sugar Mountain </em>is an invaluable document-- and a pretty compelling one, too.</p></div>"|12497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12497-sugar-mountain-live-at-canterbury-house-1968/|8.0|Marc Masters

The Leeds, England-based quartet was making sweetly disheveled noise-pop reminiscent of the Aislers Set, the Shop Assistants, and the Primitives before Vivian Girls existed. They were adding <em>Psycho</em> to their girl-group rhythmic <em>candy</em> before Crystal Stilts signed to a label. Their self-titled debut proved they not only had now-fashionable reference points but also catchy, well-crafted songs; two years later,<em> Burnt Out Landscapes</em>, the Manhattan Love Suicides' overstuffed EPs and rarities compilation, reiterates the band's strengths while also demonstrating broader stylistic diversity than their RIYL line might suggest.</p><p>This sprawling 27-song disc collects nearly all of the Manhattan Love Suicides' best songs, including the contents of last year's <em>Keep It Coming</em> EP on Lost Music, <em>Kick It Back</em> EP on Magic Marker, and <em>Sycamore Peripheral</em> EP on Cloudberry, plus a WOXY radio session, previously compilation-only tracks, and other odds and ends. Fans of fast-paced, feedback-streaked guitar pop should head straight for stalker's anthem ""Clusterfuck"", the shrill (and superior) 7"" version of the debut's do-do-do-ing ""Kick It Back"", or the WOXY renditions of <em>The Manhattan Love Suicides</em> tracks ""Things You've Never Done"" and ""Suzy Jones"". The moderately paced ""You'll Never Get That Guy"" finds a contrast between squealing guitars and Caroline McChrystal's girlish vocals, mirroring the lyrics, ""I've got pleasure, and you've got pain""; ""Keep It Coming"" is Times New Viking's ""My Head"" hopped up on heartbreak instead of drug money. The tambourine-splashed 7"" take of ""Thinking Is Killing Me"" ditches the self-titled LP version's acoustic strums and cello for something resembling Weezer's ""Don't Let Go"" blanketed in extra distortion. On ""Leader of the Pack"" update ""Head Over Heels"" and new song ""Jonny Boy"", the Manhattan Love Suicides explore the idealistic 1950s-1960s teenagerdom that used to obsess the Raveonettes. Meanwhile, ""Sycamore Peripheral"" and ""Dazzle the Blind"" have shimmying beats, but their buried vocals seem to betray a lack of confidence, as neither sticks in the head like the otherwise-similar ""Cracked Open"".<br/><br/>A 27-song compilation would make more sense from a better-known band-- as a 14-track best-of, this could've been almost flawless-- but it does give the Manhattan Love Suicides room to try new directions. Teenage Jesus and the Jerks cover ""Orphans"" slices into seething, atonal no-wave befitting the Lydia Lunch-affiliated director of the band's namesake film; ""Finding the End of the Line (With Random Number)"" loses McChrystal's voice in dreamy electronics and programmed beats worthy of High Places or Land of the Loops. The closest the Manhattan Love Suicides get to fellow shoegazers A Place to Bury Strangers is ""Detroit Diesel"", which drives straight into <em>Darklands</em> without losing its way. ""The things that I would kill for are the things you are living for,"" McChrystal sings on ""Wolves"". <em>Burnt Out Landscapes</em> isn't worth killing for, but-- especially if you like to sing along to your C86- or JAMC-indebted songs, rather than just hear them convey a consistent mood-- it's well worth owning.</p></div>"|12476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12476-burnt-out-landscapes/|7.3|Marc Hogan

Their previous <em>Kitsun√© Maison</em> compilations showcased a ridiculously long list of interesting acts-- great and terrible, sometimes at the same time-- who in one way or another combine a punk/DIY mindset with dance: Hot Chip, Digitalism, Metronomy, Simian Mobile Disco, Bloc Party, Lo-Fi-Funk, Au Revoir Simone, Joakim, Wolf Mother, MSTRKRFT, Klaxons, Van She, Feist, Guns N' Bombs, M.I.A., the list goes on. There's been a good amount of variety on these comps, but this is a genre with a fairly low bar to entry: big obvious beats, some not overly polished vocals, and a decent jpeg from LastNightsParty are enough to get you started.</p><p>As Balearic-style slow disco, dubstep, and minimal techno provide headier and less populist alternatives, and the biggest names in its discography become successful, Kitsun√© is skimming off the top of an increasingly large pool of low-risk electro-house tracks. But <em>Kitsun√© Maison 6</em> is subtitled <em>The Melodic One</em>, presumably because it also includes some non-dance material. That's a smart move, and basically all of the disc is at least listenable. Still, it can't match previous standouts like Simian Mobile Disco's ""I Believe"", Whitest Boy Alive's ""Done With You"", Yelle's ""Cause De Gar√ßons"", Jenny Wilson's ""Let My Shoes Lead Me Forward"", Feist's ""My Moon My Man"", Thieves Like Us's ""Drugs in My Body"", or Crystal Castles' ""Knights""-- and a lot of those were melodic, too.</p><p>On <em>Kitsun√© Maison 6</em>, elder electroclashers Fischerspooner no longer stand out as much for their luxurious production values, exhibited here on the breathy, buzzing ""Danse en France (D.I.M. Remix)"". Glossier still is Grovesnor's Balearic blue-eyed 1980s electro-soul ballad ""Drive Your Car (Hot Chip Remix)"", arguably the biggest highlight. Also occasionally hitting the serotonin spot is Heartsrevolution's ""Ultraviolence"", which gives Crystal Castles a better run for their haunted analogue distorto-scream-house money than You Love Her Coz She's Dead's ""Superheroes"". A-Trak's bassy, ""Hustler""-like ""Say Whoa"" still sounds like as good a way to start a run-- assuming you're still capable of such a thing after all this downloading-- as it did when it originally appeared on his entry in Nike's <em>Original Run</em> series. BENI's ""My Love Sees You"" isn't ""My Love"", but it's fine enough vocal-tweaked spacey disco. And autoKratz's pulsing ""Stay the Same (Edit)"", though sort of like a blander version of the Teenagers, stops to let a coin spin for about eight seconds halfway through. As novelty goes, this is fun.</p>
<p>It's not that <em>Kitsun√© Maison 6</em> has the low points of even a couple of its predecessors, it's just that it's rarely worth losing many brain cells over. Another somewhat memorable track, Ted &amp; Francis' organ-drenched ""I Wish I Was a Polar Bear (Arctic Urgency)"", ought to be in some Quentin Tarantino-type movie two decades from now: an earnest ice-cap electropop equivalent of Harry Nilsson's ""Coconut"" (you can skip the breakdown, though, Quent-- oh, and I'll have my people tell you where to send the check). Lo-Fi-Funk's ""Want U"", which puts chunky guitars and synth strobes above handclaps and a thumping beat, will be a favorite of adolescent unrequited lovers who are also bloggers. Le Roux's sultry ""Quicksand"" has a syncopated rhythm and keyboards; bring on the Jos√© Gonz√°lez cover. Speaking of Sweden, they'd never have called this <em>The Melodic One</em> over there. But that's a story for another RSS-reader tag.</p></div>"|12489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12489-kitsune-maison-6-the-melodic-one/|5.9|Marc Hogan

But in the case of Austin-based Future Clouds &amp; Radar, songwriter and former Cotton Mather frontman Robert Harrison's art rock is so compellingly embellished with psychedelic tinges and pop swirls that the urge to spot reference points soon falls away. <i>Peoria</i>, the band's follow-up to their sprawling self-titled debut, craftily pits hold-your-hand pop against more shadowy terrain within its half-hour lifespan, resulting in a record that stands easily on its own merits.</p>
<p><i>Peoria</i>'s pearls aren't hard to find. Once your ears stop sifting through the songs looking for <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i> and <i>White Album</i> nods, you'll also stop noticing Harrison's oddly Lennonesque vocals (this despite hailing from Texas) or benign similarities like the ""Across the Universe"" melody that ekes its way into ""Mummified"". If Lennon's accusation of McCartney was that he was ""pizza and fairytales,"" then Future Clouds &amp; Radar are warm laundry and machetes. Indeed, <i>Peoria</i> is so pleasant to wrap yourself in, it's easy to miss the darker elements, like the ""Found a mockingbird/ And I drowned it"" couplet in ""Old Edmund Ruffin"". Just keep the blackbird away from Old Edmund's fish tank.</p>
<p>Future Clouds &amp; Radar lopped off a lot of extra fat between their double-disc debut and <i>Peoria</i>'s eight tracks, and the leaner profile is a much better look. But even within this tighter framework, they've left room for instrumental and textural variety. Opener and single ""The Epcot View"" starts off innocently enough with a balmy drum machine that dissolves behind its earnest melody. The two-minute piano-driven ""Feet on Grass"" pinches the album with an orchestral belt, then drifts into the dreamy ""Mummified"", which strays into seven-minute territory with Hollie Thomas' schizophrenic key tapping. In case you hadn't noticed the death themes by this point, the band kindly reminds you with ""The Mortal"" and ""Mortal 926"". The first pauses the 1960s filters to break down into a Flaming Lips jam mid-song, and the industrial instrumental ""Mortal 926"" could easily double as a detective show theme song with mounting brass and unresolved bass line. The brevity of some tracks and the rambling jams in others are-- surprisingly-- complementary, melding Future Clouds &amp; Radar's moments down Willy Wonka's scary tunnel with a more traditional tour.</p>
<p>The band's only missteps occur in the last track, ""Follow the Crane"", which has a few extraneous sound effects-- dog barks, sirens-- that come off like an overly busy holdover from their debut. These moments aside, it's an otherwise solid wrap-up of <i>Peoria</i>'s sinister ends. I've always resented being fooled into an extra glance or two in my rearview mirrors. But here at the record's close, Thomas' keyboard floats like it would in a movie when the protagonist moves into a big house and swears she heard music coming from the cobwebbed upstairs. For a few moments, a fairy tale emerges and fades, there's a nice melodic coda, and the curtain falls on the album's dreamy run. <i>Peoria</i> is smart, carefully crafted, and loads more efficient than Future Clouds' debut, suggesting that there's a lot to look forward to in the band's next episode.</p></div>"|12478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12478-peoria/|6.9|Kasia Galazka

Since then, Mwamwaya raised his profile the quickest way one can in music blog circles-- via collaborations, covers, and remixes. Continuing their Six Degrees of Indie game, Radioclit and Mwamwaya leaked ""Get It Up""-- which featured not only Maya herself, but also Santogold-- ""Kamphopo"", built on an Architecture in Helsinki track, and covers of the Beatles and Vampire Weekend featuring, respectively, the Ruby Suns and, uh, Vampire Weekend. The refreshing thing, however, was that unlike 95% of the superfluous odds and sods clogging blogspace, these tracks were actually really good.</p><p>It's easy to be cynical about this process of easing Western listeners into Esau Mwamwaya's music-- RIYL Vampire Weekend, Ruby Suns, other English-language artists cribbing from African music-- until you hear the music itself, and in particular the whole of he and Radioclit's free mixtape, <em>Are the Very Best</em>. Once you get through the indie-guarded gates, Mwamwaya and Radioclit are open here to everything from South Africa's marabi and kwaito music to Hans Zimmer scores to French and American hip-hop to Michael Jackson-- and in most cases, it's the tracks that lean furthest away from the familiar that work best. The regal ""Sister Betina"", BLK JKS collaboration ""Salota"", and Radioclit productions ""Funa Funa"" and ""Kada Manja"" are as immediately likable as the rest of the mix. And, frankly, much of the best-known source material here-- ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"", the AiH backdrop on ""Kamphopo"", the <em>True Romance</em> via <em>Badlands</em> theme on ""Chikandi"", the loathsome Beatles song ""Birthday""-- is either simply a blueprint or sketch for other ideas, or is vastly improved by Mwamwaya's treatments.</p><p>Mwamwaya's cultural cross-section is no accident. Although he sings in his native Chichewa, he met Radioclit's Etienne Tron when he sold the producer a used bike in a London junkshop. Despite that, Mwamwaya and Radioclit's talents lie far beyond cultural fusion and curatorial skills: In short, they've created just about the most listenable and flat-out enjoyable record of the year-- and one that happens to dovetail nicely with the urgency for and overdue embrace of morally guided globalism.</p>
<p>Those globalistic tendencies are, unfortunately, born as much from tragedies such as the Mumbai attacks and economic fears as they are the afterglow of Barack Obama's election. (And, sadly, not born out of crises in Darfur, Kenya, Chad, and far too many other places.) But culturally, this century's renewed Western interest in the music of Africa, the Middle East, South America, China, and elsewhere seems largely free of the condescending and touristic tones that it carried in the 1980s. Instead of searching for a supposed antidote for MTV and synth-pop and whatever else got authenticity watchdogs up in arms a quarter-century ago, now it seems as if people are exploring increasing amounts of non-Western music simply because they have increased access to it and are enjoying the hell out of it.</p>
<p>Mwamwaya's fusion, of course, can't be boiled down to Africa vs. the West, a laughably simplistic formula. He's assimilating from a wide range of music both from his home continent-- the clattery, choatic sounds of kuduro or marabi, the refreshing blank space and clean lines of highlife, the deep, loping, patient kwaito-- and around the globe. So <em>The Very Best</em> is far from a primer, but it's not aiming to be an introduction to anything other than the sensibilities and sounds of its creators. It turns out to be wide-ranging, not only in sound but spirit. Mwamwaya plays heart-tugging on the ""Birthday"" cover and ""Funa Funa"", gets earnest on ""Dinosaur on the Ark"", and displays a wicked sense of humor all over the place: An outstanding reworking of M.I.A.'s ""Boyz"", the tongue-in-cheek cover art, and an extended runout of Michael Jackson's <em>Free Willy</em> theme ""Will You Be There"" that turns into a reminder that they've given you this mixtape free followed by a plea to look out for (to still ""be there"" for) Mwamwaya's proper album. In the meantime, consider this freebie an early holiday gift.</p></div>"|12503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12503-esau-mwamwaya-and-radioclit-are-the-very-best/|8.6|Scott Plagenhoef

The result: Two extended players that solidly stand alone. <br/><br/><em>Lust</em> succeeded this year by adding muscle to the group's sometimes overly produced, sometimes authenticity-obsessed 1950s biker-film swagger. Like <em>Lust</em>, these new EPs find the band striking a balance between <em>Whip It On</em>'s straight-forward simplicity and aural ruckus and <em>Pretty in Black</em>'s clean and stately Everly Brothers homages. <em>Beauty</em> <em>Dies</em> track ""Black White"" kicks off with a backslapping snare hit, serpentine bass and guitar, and in-unison breathy vocals. ""Here Comes the End"" features a loop-y tranquil noise intro like 90s space-rock unit Flying Saucer Attack that sways to a bouncy rhythm and Sune's Link Wray-wrapped axwork.

In 2003, the Raveonettes released the go-go, pill-poppin' romp ""The Christmas Song"" with lyrics about snow, santa, and time spent with loved ones. <em>Wishing You a Rave Christmas</em> also features its share of sleigh bells, snowmen, and sass. A cover of ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"" is haunted by a ghostly synth whistling through the wind. ""Christmas Ghosts"" follows a standard Shangri-Las-like song structure, with arpeggiated guitar chords and Sune's ""lover don't go"" pleadings. The most playful of the bunch is ""Come On Santa"" with its bells, jangle-y clean guitars, and marching drum snare rolls. Adding to the appeal of these paired down yet still bold tunes is the brevity of the EP-- even a high-octane record <em>Lust Lust Lust</em> can sometimes get tiresome over its 12 tracks.

Their new EP <em>Acoustics</em>, however, marks the first time they've treated that format as a stopgap between albums. As you may have guessed from the title, this is Minus the Bear unplugged, with one new song and six photocopies of old songs played essentially the same way as the originals with slightly different instruments.<br/><br/>For some reason, the non-electric policy doesn't seem to apply to the bass guitar, and I swear I'm hearing some electric piano on ""We Are Not a Football Team"", ""Pachuca Sunrise"", and ""Ice Monster"", though that could simply be very skillful layering of acoustic guitar harmonics-- these guys do have some chops, after all. The new song, ""Guns &amp; Ammo"", sounds like, well, Minus the Bear without electric guitars and keyboards, and I don't mean that to sound dismissive. They're a distinctive band. But it's a track that only people who are already pretty big fans of the band need to hear, and the same can be said for the rest of this EP-- the electric versions of these songs are all more interesting than these acoustic ones.<br/><br/>None of these tracks are outright misses granted, but the energy level feels low, and de-amplifying the guitars doesn't have a huge effect because the band in its electric guise has never relied much on distortion of other effects that would significantly change the tone. One of the band's most memorable songs, ""Pachuco Sunrise"", loses the dancey bounce of its original chorus in favor of strumming and a fairly basic backbeat-- the rhythmic dynamism is definitely missed.<br/><br/>""Knights"", one of four songs originally from last year's <em>Planet of Ice</em>, retains nearly every proggy guitar flourish of its source, turning the stuttering CD-skip-like instrumental hook into a little descending phrase, and it's likely fans will enjoy parsing out exactly what they did to make the re-arrangement work. Everyone else can safely leave this EP, a digital release only available in physical form at the band's shows, alone.</p></div>"|12485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12485-acoustics-ep/|5.2|Joe Tangari

At her best, Pip Brown sounds like she wrote the damn book herself: ""Back of the Van"" could have headlined the soundtrack to the great never-filmed <em>Goonies</em> sequel, worthy at least for the relentless ""You set me on/ You set me on fire!"" chorus. The Numan ""Cars"" rip in ""Paris Is Burning"" adorns a kaleidoscopic junk pile of skittering drums, piano stabs, and palm-muted guitar. It seems that for almost every retread like ""Love Don't Live Here"" or ""Crazy World"", there's at least a lining of forward thinking. Take the percussive ""Dusk Till Dawn"", which marches along to the beat of both the urban white chic of Gwen Stefani and the coke-nosed disco rock of Franz Ferdinand. Hands down, the best moment on the record comes with the bass-drum punctuation to Brown's ""Bang bang bang/ On the wall"" mantra. To wit: some filler, some <em>Thriller</em>.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In more ways than one, the images communicate the content. On <em>Ladyhawke</em>'s cover illustration, Brown kneels half-clothed in a messy rumpus room, Famicom controllers and Casios strewn about the floor, Zapper gun stuck in her belt, her gaze intently fixed upon an off-canvas television. Flanked by her pet cats, Pip Brown affects the image of an Internet Age spinster, clinging to remembrances of video-game antiquity. And so it is with the music: <em>Ladyhawke</em> is brimming with ideas whose worst moments quantify this past and whose best build upon it.</p></div>"|12483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12483-ladyhawke/|6.6|Mike Orme

Game developers and composers have naturally moved on since that Golden Age, taking full advantage of increased storage and faster machines. If you play ""Rock Band"", you've certainly heard AC/DC's ""Let There Be Rock"" in crystal clarity, while EA Sports pumps out CD-quality jock jams in all their recent titles. Still, the wonky buzzsaw of the chiptune aesthetic continues to draw hardcore fans of its retro sound.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Crystal Castles, who've helped to kickstart the most recent 08(-bit) conversation, were named after the Atari game but can't really be called chiptunes-- to these ears, they channel the electroclash movement with the judicious support of a few bygone beeps. Conversely, Benny Boeldt isn't really into video games these days, and he doesn't consider himself a chiptunes composer. But his debut record is heavily indebted to Sega and Nintendo themes. Bearing the same name as the popular Atari 2600 game, Adventure's self-titled full-length explores a curious style that once required a composer to deftly balance melody, counterpoint, and rhythm with the constraints of a couple of simple pulse channels and bursts of random static.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Perhaps fittingly, Boeldt looks to co-opt this delicate process, wielding a simple sound wave as a double-edged broadsword rather than a scalpel. His pieces, unfettered by the four-channel restriction, charge forward with hyper-melodic and extremely hooky passages, often imbuing a lyrical touch. Tracks like ""Travel Kid"" and closer ""Jurassic Park  City"" recall the bubblegum abandon of the Human League or New Order (suggested overtly by the machine-gun ""Blue Monday"" beat driving the latter). While <em>Blade Runner</em> samples float around ""Poison Diamonds"", a high-pitched synth yearn skitters straight out of the Yellow Magic Orchestra playbook, perhaps expressing the same humanity jones as the replicants from the Ridley flick.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Boeldt's tracks also suffer from an extreme case of attention deficit, rife with dizzingly arpeggiated passages that often breathe but just as often hyperventilate. By the time you get to the aptly named 8-bit blues of ""Wild Wild Ride"", you've been push-pulled up and down the minor scale so much that you're checking yourself for internal organ damage. It's no surprise that Boeldt hails from the Baltimore-based Wham City collective, as he's got the same issues that sometimes trip up fellow Whammer Dan Deacon: losing the distinction between giddy maximalism and plain ol' <em>too much</em>. But it's best not to overthink <em>Adventure</em>. When you're in the car and you hear nearby drivers bumping jock jams or AC/DC, you can probably take pleasure in popping this in, because while they're only cruising up the street or down the highway, you're headed off to some distant, perilous, pixilated world.</p></div>"|12477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12477-adventure/|6.0|Mike Orme

Turns out it was one time too many. The first, at 87-year-old midtown Manhattan fixture Town Hall, was quiet, seated, and quaint. Her voice was pristine and her strands of festive lights hung down just so. The second, at Brooklyn's emptied McCarren Park Pool, was spacious, breezy, and yet still quaint. She made a pool joke before starting ""The Water"" and she turned the concrete shell into a cozy sanctuary. Problems arose at a show this year inside NYC's cavernous Hammerstein Ballroom, though. By April, Feist was well into the victory lap stage of her <em>Reminder</em> stint-- between the Apple endorsement, the one-take videos, and (oh yeah) the near-perfect batch of broken-hearted tunes tying everything together, she tapped into a mainline somewhere between your mom's Bose CD alarm clock and your Nano. <br/>¬†<br/>But even with the expanded fan base, <em>The Reminder</em> is big on music that's very tiny. It all but demands rapt attention. So the Hammerstein crowd-- boisterous, bored, and oblivious-- ignored her attempts at intimacy, waited for the song from the commercial, and then left soon after. The experience was disappointing, though it wasn't Feist's fault. That third show exposed how <em>The Reminder</em>'s modesty could work against it-- how its no-frills profundity could be misread as a totally sweet Bed Bath &amp; Beyond soundtrack. <br/>¬†<br/>Of course, it's much more than that, as this timely reissue-- coupled with a bonus disc filled with videos, remixes, demos, and rarities-- um, reminds us. This is anti-cynic music made by a woman flighty enough to call her house the Unicorn Ranch yet wise enough to lace her bouncy smash with semi-depressing nostalgia. Take away the blue sequins, Gap dancers, and rainbow Nano-ization, and ""1234"" basically counts up the years until ""money can't buy you back the love that you had then."" For passers-by, Feist could be chalked up as a Lilith leftover, an Enya-style new age balm for our Crackberried brains. And <em>The Reminder</em> works on that level. <em>The Village Voice</em> slammed its ""overall tenor of emotional feebleness and submission"" while unfavorably comparing Feist to spiky former alt-rock heroines Liz Phair and Courtney Love. But, at the same time, the album isn't an easy-listening devolution as much as it's a considered maturation-- a path both Phair and Love have yet to tread. While that may sound a bit AARP, this 32-year-old Canadian makes growing up sound sexy and tough. She feels it all, but doesn't stamp and wail about it. <br/>¬†<br/>Her most successful videos-- ""1234"" and ""I Feel It All"", both directed by Patrick Daughters-- are joyous affairs, but there's also an element of discipline involved. Both were shot in one take and choreographed to match precise camera moves. They're child's play that only an adult could pull off-- igniting synchronized fireworks to celebrate inevitable masochism (""I'll be the one who'll break my heart""). The clips highlight <em>The Reminder</em>'s push-pull and make it clear that, with the right amount of creativity, synergy, and charisma, music videos still have the ability to spark mass culture 25 years after ""Thriller"". <br/>¬†<br/>The remixes found on the bonus disc accentuate <em>The Reminder</em>'s toe-tapping viability and slightly stretch indie dance night preconceptions. Sixteen-piece Brooklyn disco revivalists Escort put the Nile Rodgers impulses on hold for their take on ""I Feel It All"", instead giving the rhythm a winning marching band bent. And while Justice wannabe Boys Noize and 1980s synth fetishists Chromeo characteristically underline grooves for ""My Moon, My Man"" and ""Sealion Woman"" respectively, best in show goes to Australian remix group Van She Tech, whose remix provides a French-house ""1234"" workout that even Daft Punk would have trouble topping. It's the only truly necessary track on the bonus disc-- the type of song iTunes was invented for. The odds and ends that round out the bonus disc are superfluous at best, troublingly MOR at worst. Spare demos of ""So Sorry"" and Broken Social Scene favorite ""Lover's Spit"" don't match the well known originals. Scat-rap warning: Feist's generally embarrassing duet with <em>Reminder</em> co-producer Mocky, ""Fightin' Away the Tears"", comes way too close to Jason Mraz territory and suggests the knob twiddler should remain behind the boards. <br/>¬†<br/><em>The Reminder</em> is one of those very few supposedly star-making albums that actually made a star out of its creator. This is a great thing. But it can be discombobulating for an artist who toils in humble fallibility. For instance, it seems like Feist may have heard some of those loud chatterers at the Hammerstein Ballroom earlier this year: ""(My career) has become kind of large and it really began for me very, very small-- like me alone in my bedroom with my four track and a pair of headphones,"" she told the Canadian Press recently. ""I just need to go back there for a while to get my bearings again and then know what to do next."" There's little reason to doubt her instincts.</p></div>"|12501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12501-the-reminder-deluxe-edition/|6.2|Ryan Dombal

Where others have disappeared (Oval), taken on a curatorial role (Gas), or resigned themselves to arms-length abstraction (Autechre), Fennesz has evolved his aesthetic and found new avenues of expression. In the last few years he's released two albums with Ryuichi Sakamoto, collaborated with Mike Patton and guitarist Burkhard Stangl, knocked out some remixes, and created music for dance and films. He's been busy, but people who don't follow this music closely probably haven't noticed. They've been waiting for a new solo album, preferably something that might cross over from the ""electronic music"" racks in the way that 2001's monumental <em>Endless Summer</em> did. But Fennesz's unhurried approach to his solo work has yielded dividends. Since he takes so long between proper Fennesz records, the release of a new one still feels like an event. <br/><br/><em>Black Sea</em>, which again finds Fennesz working primarily with guitar and computer, is his first solo album since 2004's <em>Venice</em>, the follow-up to <em>Endless Summer</em>. It's tempting to compare this record with its predecessor based on the characteristically striking cover art, once again by Touch label founder Jon Wozencroft. Where the <em>Venice</em> sleeve featured a lone rowboat bobbing in rich and impossibly blue water, <em>Black Sea</em> sports a shot of an industrial skyline across a filthy-bottomed straight at low tide. The image and title suggest that we're in for something colder and comparatively grim, and even though that's only partly true, such subtle shading via imagery has always been important with Fennesz albums. What <em>is</em> apparent right off the bat is that <em>Black Sea</em> finds Fennesz painting on an especially large canvas. While some may hope for a partial return to the pop-like miniatures of <em>Endless Summer</em>, tracks that could be thought of as ""songs,"" these feel more like classical pieces-- sweeping and symphonic and patiently unfolding. <br/><br/>It's not just that several tracks are longer, with three running over eight minutes. Fennesz has also sequenced the record to give parts of it a suite-like feel. Opener ""Black Sea"" bleeds into ""The Colour of Three"" without a pause, joining the tracks with the sort of howling, finely granulated drone he specializes in. Together the cuts add up to an 18-minute epic, one that moves from stirring rumbles of low static to a buzzing assault that sounds like it was recorded inside a helicopter's engine to a resigned acoustic guitar figure that feels like wind brushing past an abandoned building. In other words it feels like a <em>ride</em>, like the music transports you bodily from one place to the next rather than creating an ""environment."" And it's best heard loud when given lots of attention. <br/><br/>Indeed, <em>Black Sea</em> is an intensely physical album, even for Fennesz, which is ironic considering that he's always put digital signifiers-- glitches, pops, crackles-- in the foreground. The guitar, a common thread throughout, offers an anchor of familiarity. But it's the relentless experiments with the emotional possibilities of texture-- experiments only possible with a computer-- that give the album its weight. So the physicality is focused in very precise and specific ways. Where Fennesz's more abstract early material could be wild and chaotic-- you pictured an unsteady hand on the lever, struggling to control the torrent of sound-- he's at a place now where everything is extremely careful and ordered, with nothing left to chance. <br/><br/>This cerebral approach doesn't diminish the impact of the raw, enveloping moments on <em>Black Sea</em>'s second half. ""Glide"", a standout that ranks with anything Fennesz has created, gets over primarily on carefully sculpted volume as it builds to a hair-raising peak. An edit of a live collaboration with fellow Touch artist Rosy Parlane, ""Glide"" proceeds along a single line for nine minutes, as a tense held chord is obscured by a cloud of white noise. Both the prickly wash of sound and the underlying drone gather steadily until the piece pivots on a bass tone and then finally bursts open like an overfilled balloon, allowing a gleaming synth, almost shocking in its tenderness, to come pouring out. It's here that Fennesz's mastery of pacing and structure, honed over the last decade, is so apparent. The following ""Vacuum"", a melodic soundscape piece that sounds like it could have come from <em>Venice</em>, is pleasant but comparatively slight, while ""Glass Ceiling"" combines thin, piercing tones, bell-like figures, and processed guitar in an appealingly disorienting way. The closing ""Saffron Revolution"" feels like a summing up of the record's best moments, as it gradually moves from cavernous gurgles, dissonant, sawing chords, and spidery bits of guitar into an immense drone that completely dominates whatever space its heard in. <br/><br/>In a sense <em>Black Sea</em> feels like a more self-consciously ""sophisticated"" version of Fennesz, as if his time playing concert halls and opera houses inspired him to compose music suitable for such grand settings. But he's a composer up to the task and <em>Black Sea</em> ultimately proves to be worth the long wait. And in the end, the wider scope suits him. In 1995, Fennesz debuted on Mego with an EP called <em>Instrument</em>, which found him probing the musical properties of the guitar/computer interface. Each of its four pieces sounded like the work of a guy tinkering with a single idea, seeing how vibrating strings and feedback might be bent and twisted to create a particular effect. Despite the thick force of these tracks, <em>Instrument</em> is small-scale music, a scribbled note passed from one insider to the next. Heard next to it, <em>Black Sea</em> is positively huge while also being much more accessible. You get a sense here of how far Fennesz has come, how far his music reaches, and the unexplored possibilities that still exist.</p></div>"|12502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12502-black-sea/|8.4|Mark Richardson

The similarities end there though, as the Nova Scotia quintet instead favor tighter, heavier rock anthems. Wintersleep have found their popular niche and are cautiously experimenting, though that is not to say that they're timid. Like toes grazing icy waters, they have the potential to go farther yet seem to resist, pushing hard against their limits without ever fully stepping outside of them.</p><p><em>Welcome to the Night Sky</em>, Wintersleep's third album, is largely composed of straightforward yet emotional rock comparable to Band of Horses and early R.E.M., particularly on songs like ""Astronaut"", where singer Paul Murphy's voice soars triumphantly over a jangle of guitars with reassuringly familiar yet effective melodies. Since most of the tracks are between two and four minutes, there is little time for meandering, and Wintersleep have a tendency to cut straight for the gold with infectious guitar lines and persuasive, high-energy choruses. The band's self-control usually works in their favor, however, and they are able to translate grand ideas in a relatively short amount of time so the songs communicate successfully without ever having the opportunity to become exhausting. And although Wintersleep may stick to a fairly loose formula, they also color their music with impressive motifs. The album's organ-driven centerpiece, ""Weighty Ghost"", sounds like it's channelling Paul Simon with cleverly layered group backing vocals and subtle handclaps that end up making the song more memorable and the sound fully encompassing. Both ""Dead Letter and the Infinite Yes"" and ""Murderer"" provide a platform for Murphy's darker musings on mental illness, supported by guitars that twist and swell beneath like they're trying to fight their way out of an unlit maze.</p><p>It is drummer and founding member Loel Campbell, however, who provides Wintersleep's magic touch. While the group's songwriting certainly pulls off a trick or two, the end result would have significantly less impact under the treatment of a weaker rhythm section. The passion behind Campbell's attentive, driving beats gives the songs a grittier edge, the lyrics more feeling, and pushes along the rest of the band with a momentum that connects the listener to the song faster than one might anticipate at the outset.</p>
<p><em>Welcome to the Night Sky</em> has a tendency to sound like accessible indie rock by the numbers-- an empathetic ballad here, a stadium fist-puncher there-- but Wintersleep maintain a strong identity that sets them apart from less interesting contemporaries. It's actually the album's eight-minute closing track, ""Miasmal Smoke &amp; the Yellow Bellied Freaks"", that shows a different side to the group's potential. Here they slacken the reigns a little, getting lost in an epic swirl of guitar reverb that recalls Explosions in the Sky and keeps building with a determination and inventiveness that will hopefully carry through to further recordings.</p></div>"|12472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12472-welcome-to-the-night-sky/|7.0|Mia Clarke

Spencer Yeh probably wasn't thinking of a productive, quasi-prominent career in noise and drone when he dreamt up the name <span class=""nfakPe"">Burning</span> <span class=""nfakPe"">Star</span> Core. The Cincinnati-based out-music impresario has been scattering releases over labels and formats since the turn of the century, in the process becoming one of the most reliably prickly artists in the genre. Increasingly, Yeh's albums have moved away from in-the-red amplifiers toward shaky, clattering landscapes. <em>Challenger</em>, one of BSC's most composed, coherent works, still manages a decadence and anger that belie Yeh's veteran status. Here he abandons the harsh industrial tones of recent releases and molds globular sound over expansive space.</p><p>Yeh has never been an out-and-out noise-monster-- he's no Prurient or Kevin Drumm-- but there's a substantial difference between, to pull just one recent example, the dungeon sounds of ""A Curse on the Coast"" from last year's <em>Blood Lightning 2007</em> and <em>Challenger</em>'s ""Mysteries of the Organ"". With its slowly oscillating notes and sawing melody, ""Mysteries"" might fit on a more subtle electronic record by someone like Jan Jelinek, or at least it would've until someone pushed that heavily treated piano down a staircase near the four-minute mark. <em></em></p><p><em>Challenger</em> presents Yeh as an active composer rather than a feverish minion of noise. The shift likely has something to do with instrumentation. Rarely on <em>Challenger</em> will you hear the recognizable slashes of Yeh's instrument of choice, the violin. Previous BSC albums have felt like the result of several folks huddled too closely in a room, waiting out chaos. But while it's easy enough to make deep black noise when you're holding down an organ key and waiting for a tube amp to do something interesting, it's a different game entirely to sprinkle crackling loops over sculpted ambience.</p>
<p>The change can be seen on ""Mezzo Forte"". Yeh revisits a favored pastime-- manipulating syllabic utterances-- but does so with more clarity, turning a back-throat hum into a lapping, near-rhythmic trance by mid-track. A pleasantly thumbed piano adds structure and melody to the final minute.</p>
<p>The final track, ""Un Coeur en Hiver"", contains plenty of the industrial hum-- whirring belts, sparking metal-- that has characterized BSC's crassest moments, but Yeh neuters their effects with light synth touches. Yeh even momentarily suspends the clatter, allowing swaths of unfettered, major-key synthesizer to float through the speakers. ""Hopelessly Devoted"" gathers around a low-energy drone and a voice treated beyond recognition. ""No Memories, No Plans"", bleak in both title and execution, consists of hundreds of tiny clacking noises and some background street noise; it's either a fantastic amateur fireworks show or a sonic recreation of Wile E. Coyote landing in a bin of Acme mousetraps.</p>
<p><em>Challenger</em> doesn't quite rewrite the BSC playbook, but it does represent a shift in tone and process that feels both welcome and promising. Fitter, happier, more productive? Perhaps not, but a grown man can't live on drone alone. For perhaps the first time in his decade-long career, Yeh's music seeks clarity.</p></div>"|12482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12482-challenger/|7.9|Andrew Gaerig

Formed in 2001 by Nick Fort√© and Steve Silverstein, they released their Kranky debut <em>Model 91 </em>a year later. It featured simple, looping songs made mostly with guitar, bass, and the occasional left-field vocal. The fertile music suggested much more to come, but four years passed before the arrival of a follow-up, the meditative<em> Land of Nope</em> (part of the Melted Mailbox subscription series). Having become an all-instrumental trio with the addition of Peter Kerlin, Christmas Decorations had evolved greatly, incorporating a wider variety of sounds and sources into their bubbling mix.</p><p>Last year a third album, <em>Communal Rust</em>, expanded their palate further, adding glitchy electronics in the vein of Markus Popp or Christian Fennesz. <em>Far Flung Hum</em>, the group's first release on their own label, is another step forward. It may not be a huge advance in sonic terms-- most of the sounds here are similar to those on previous records. But it's the first time that Christmas Decorations' thoughtful alchemy has felt so natural. Patient and highly textural, these six songs are more like growths than compositions, as inevitable as vines creeping down an old brick wall, or weeds sprouting up through an untended garden.</p><p>Like those slow-moving phenomena, each song builds gradually and almost imperceptibly. Opener ""Rosin Slip"" veers from folksy string plucks to scrapes, slaps, and buzzes that seem random, but coalesce into a mini-symphony. The rattling ""Turning Into Birds"" creates a rickety rhythm out of watery burbling and kitchen-sink percussion. Imagine the minimalist sound art of outsiders like Jeph Jerman or Sean Meehan transformed into a Tom Waits-style junkyard stomp. <em>Far Flung Hum </em>peaks with ""Broken Leg Hours"", a rumbling, densely atmospheric piece. Rummaging through shortwave-ish beeps and outdoor ambience, the group makes deep space transmissions and chirping field recordings sound like twins. It's as if they decided to craft a planetarium soundtrack by recording the stars from a moonlit porch.</p>
<p>Maybe these pieces are destined to accompany films, preferably time-lapse footage of nature along the lines of Godfrey Reggio's <em>Qatsi </em>trilogy. Just as Reggio paired Philip Glass' chiming minimalism with cars whizzing by and escalators pushing the masses, it's easy to imagine <em>Far Flung Hum </em>married to shots of flowers blooming, ice crystallizing, and bacteria multiplying. Either way, the hypnotic quality of natural growth is already there, embedded in Christmas Decorations' transfixing sounds.</p></div>"|12471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12471-far-flung-hum/|7.5|Marc Masters

The guy was already a ball of conflicts and contradictions-- hand-wringing over his consumption one moment, boasting about his wealth the next. He's someone as driven by ego as he is plagued by doubt-- in other words, a wholly human pop star. This year, however, was particularly rough: He and his fianc√©e broke up, and his mother, Donda West-- who alone raised Kanye from the age of three-- died from complications after cosmetic surgery. Kanye blamed himself for his mother's death, singling out his own vanity, wealth, and pursuit of glamour and celebrity. His response? He's made <i>808s and Heartbreak</i>, which as the title hints is an introspective, minimal electro-pop record steeped in regret, pain, and even more self-examination than a typical Kanye West album. And as you've no doubt heard, on <i>808s</i> West sings everything through Auto-Tune rather than rapping, a decision that for some has made this record a non-starter.</p>
<p>The recent embrace of the common studio aid seems akin to pro wrestling saying, ""Fuck it, this isn't real"" and making it more transparent and scripted (and successful). But vocal manipulation isn't only the practice of radio-ready rap, of course-- it's been a signpost for ""futuristic music"" ever since Joe Meek heard ""a New World"" almost 50 years ago. In this decade, records like Radiohead's <i>Kid A</i>/<i>Amnesiac</i>, the Knife's <i>Silent Shout</i>, and Daft Punk's <i>Discovery</i> were heralded in part for screwing with vocals; last year both Battles and Dan Deacon revived the old Alvin and the Chipmunks trick of shifting pitches and speeds; and Bon Iver's forthcoming EP features a song sung through vocoder. And, lest we forget, Kanye West himself made his name as a producer in part thanks to his ""chipmunk soul"" vocal samples. So why is this approach, from this guy, now such a problem?</p>
<p>In part it's because it's not what people want or expect from Kanye West. Stylized Auto-Tune seems to be on about every third song on top 40 radio these days, making West seem like an opportunist or a bandwagon-jumper. But Kanye has always been more of a master assimilator: He's achieved in part because he's used wealth and fame to explore the wider world-- culturally and artistically-- rather than shut himself off from it. If this guy was jumping on a radio fad here, we'd likely get an LP's worth of ""Put On""s, his summer hit and collaboration with Young Jeezy. Instead we get bedroom pop, quiet ruminations in which after staying up night after night pursuing and living the good life, Kanye wakes up to a cold, lonely dawn.</p>
<p>West's singing is shaky, of course, which is in part why he leans on the Auto-Tune. But it functions here as a democratizer as much as a crutch, because like all Kanye West songs, these are primarily about the experience of Being Kanye West. These are expressions of the specific feelings of one guy; there is still, to West at least, more emotional nourishment to be wrung from song than speech, which certainly colored his decision here. But filtering these ideas through John Legend or Chris Martin or whomever would essentially kill the whole effect. This isn't new: Kanye West's music is about being a specific celebrity more than anyone's since the solo works of John Lennon. Sure Eminem weaved biography into his songs but he also wore multiple faces and worked in and out of character when it suited him; West, on the other hand, is one of the few hip-hop artists without any pseudonyms, let alone characters.</p>
<p>Colleagues at Pitchfork have therefore wondered why this wasn't a private record West made for himself, but again nothing he's done is private, and that's in part why he's been so compelling. The album does, however, sound purposefully removed from the start. Opener ""Say You Will"" boasts one of the record's biggest vocal lines but eventually runs out into a three-minute, table-setting outro-- a patient, defeated-sounding collection of choral vocals and drum machines. (A similar trick is repeated, to much worse effect, later on ""Bad News"".)</p>
<p>But the album is much larger and brasher than it would first appear--  the closer it hews to a mix of sad-sack indie pop and elegant, monied Patrick Bateman commercial 80s sounds, the better it works. The strings on ""RoboCop"", the relatively busy sounds of ""Street Lights"", the clapping drums on ""Love Lockdown"", and the 909 and descending synth on ""Coldest Winter"" are among the sonic highlights, though even these are subtle. From West's vocal delivery to the stuttering rhythms, the album reveals folds and layers on repeated listens where at first it seems almost horrifically one-note.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that <i>808s</i> is a bit of a grower: The record's best songs-- ""Paranoid"", ""Street Lights"", ""Coldest Winter"", and ""RoboCop""-- are often its most dismal, with cavernous production giving the Auto-Tune vocals more of an echoing desolation than a pop sheen. By contrast, the more pop aspects of the album are where it relatively stumbles. ""Heartless"" and ""Love Lockdown"", both very good songs, work surprisingly well on the car radio, but they're second-tier Kanye West singles. And when the mood is broken up by outsiders or actual rapping, the results aren't pretty: The two songs featuring superstar guests-- ""Amazing"" with Jeezy and ""See You in My Nightmares"" with Lil Wayne-- are also the proper LP's low points.</p>
<p>In the end, whether you care to envelope yourself into West's pain and self-torment largely depends on what you already think of the artist. He isn't at his most eloquent here-- raw emotion and rolling expressions of self-doubt don't seem to be ripe for poetic expression (and, woof, the tacked-on ""Pinocchio Story"" is a wtf curiosity at best)-- but very few songs, perhaps only ""Welcome to Heartbreak"", ask you to care about specific rather than expressive language. For the most part, West's pain is articulated in ways that, while borne from his experiences, can be easily translated to the listener's. The kind of universality is a staple of great pop, but it's also something that many indie-centric fans don't find appealing.</p>
<p>That West's ego is a roadblock has <a href=""/article/news/142769-lollapalooza-report-sunday-scott-plagenhoef""><b>long been a lament to me</b></a>, but I think it's ultimately his strength. To twice paraphrase the wisdom of ""The Daily Show"", the guy is aiming to be the biggest pop star in the world-- he <i>should</i> feel bigger than us; too often, though, we instead ask for artists to be just like us or worse. West is endowed, however, with a sense of purpose and drive that pushes him to make records with Jon Brion, to crib from French house, to put on events rather than shows, to valorize art along with commerce at a time when major labels are circling the wagon and becoming stiflingly conservative, and to break out of his comfort zone when he wants to create a record as uncomfortable as <i>808s</i>. Nobody else on a large scale is coming close to firing imaginations on this level, and if the guy wants to make a record for himself he's earned the right to do it-- even if the public ultimately prefers his big, brash summer jams more than blubbery Notwist-like bedsit indie. If you're in the former camp, don't worry: Kanye has claimed he'll have another record out by June.</p></div>"|12498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/|7.6|Scott Plagenhoef

It just happened that the demo CDs they gave out for free at early shows eventually made their way onto the Web, via fans, some of whom then established the group's original MySpace page. The band's members have gradually moved away from a basic live-band setup on their recordings-- never further than on <em>The Age of the Understatement</em>, Arctics singer/guitarist Alex Turner's impressive debut with Miles Kane (of fellow British band the Rascals) and Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford as the Last Shadow Puppets.</p><p>Produced by Ford and arranged by Owen Pallett (aka Final Fantasy), the Last Shadow Puppets' album blows up its creators' musical and lyrical vision to late-1960s cinematic proportions. The <em>My Mistakes Were Made for You</em> EP is more like your average set of special-edition DVD extras. This U.S.-only release compiles the various UK B-sides to <em>The Age of the Understatement</em> single ""My Mistakes Were Made for You""-- two live covers and a live version of a song from the album-- plus four stripped-down renditions of other album tracks. No new original material, no radical departures, just an unnecessary glimpse behind the curtain.</p><p>It helps that ""My Mistakes Were Made for You"" is a sumptuous, groove-driven ballad about the time-tested topic of ""innocence and arrogance entwined/ In the filthiest of minds."" Although not quite as memorable or communicative as the <em>The Age of the Understatement</em>'s first two singles-- the galloping title track and lovesick last thrust ""Standing Next to Me""-- the song still manages to evoke late-60s Scott Walker or David Axelrod with its queasy strings and spaghetti-western horns. Lyrically, Turner and Kane construct the cryptic tale of a woman who might be a groupie (""It's the fame that put words in her mouth""...""a face in the crowd she's not""); their deft wordplay is clear enough taken one line at a time, but becomes intimidatingly difficult to parse over the course of the entire song.</p>
<p>Arriving alongside the new <em>Arctic Monkeys at the Apollo</em> concert DVD, the EP's three live tracks confirm an impression of Turner and his colleagues as precociously seasoned stage performers. Live in Oxford, ""Separate and Ever Deadly"" retains its organ stabs and lush orchestration. As one of the few Last Shadow Puppets songs that might as well be in Greek for those of us who don't speak British English (""secateurs"" are ""pruning shears""...I guess?), it's urgent and vaguely menacing, but still a weird choice for a <em>U.S.-only</em> EP.</p>
<p>As with the well-selected David Bowie and Billy Fury B-sides from the album's first single, the covers here are notable mostly for what they can tell us about the project's likely inspirations. Certainly, Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra were inhabiting similar cowboy-psych badlands on ""Paris Summer""; the Last Shadow Puppets perform the string-soaked adultery ballad faithfully (heh) if predictably in this live recording, with Alison Mosshart of the Kills belting out the Sinatra part like a shaky Neko Case understudy. Turner and company also do Bacharach/David composition ""My Little Red Book"" the Love way, bringing to mind another common reference point for <em>The Age of the Understatement</em>'s sound. I guess they had one too many bass players to do it <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jthVcqQa4o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the White Stripes' way</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The four ""acoustic"" tracks simply underscore the EP's proficient pointlessness. Unadorned versions of ""The Age of the Understatement"", ""Standing Next to Me"", ""The Meeting Place"", and ""My Mistakes Were Made for You"" showcase the well-crafted melodies and close harmonies beneath the orchestra-buttressed album tracks. Still, when so much of the project's appeal lies in its widescreen production, it's hard to understand who other than the most diehard fans really needs to hear these not-even-really-acoustic versions.</p></div>"|12495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12495-my-mistakes-were-made-for-you-ep/|5.8|Marc Hogan

Maybe it's because the genre's most exciting developments this year were the revelation of Burial's identity and the rise of offshoot genres like funky and wonky, meant largely to combat the stagnancy of a scene left to a war of darker-and-harder attrition. Still, Americans whose interest was piqued by <em>Untrue</em> deserve to have a few more names to put into their Rolodex, and a hit-packed mix CD is, if anything, at least a solid gateway towards a much-needed bit of genre-defining perspective.<br/><br/>That's why <em>I Love Dubstep</em>, a well-curated two-man mix courtesy of the pioneering pirate station Rinse FM is a good bet for new listeners interested in the bigger dubstep picture-- even if it's already sounding a little more like time-capsule material than the way forward. The DJs selected for this collection have plenty of bonafides: Youngsta is an early dubstep adopter who spun scene-definer tracks on the regular before he could legally buy a pint; Geeneus, meanwhile, has a production career that runs the gamut from early grime to current UK funky club hits. And, fortunately, they both have different approaches to their mixes, both in selection and mood.<br/><br/>Youngsta's disc has a consistent mood, characterized by waves of growling, fluttering bass. About one-third of his mix's 23 tracks are credited either to Skream or Benga, two of the Croydon-based foundation-builders who fortified the booming, wobbly-bassline style that ubiquitous imitation has threatened to dilute. Those signifiers stand out a bit more brightly when these two are involved: Skream's almost lighthearted, ska-infused touch on ""Dutch Flowerz"" and Benga's energy-flashing raver flashback ""Flames"" toy with expanding the parameters of the sound, while the consecutive 1-2 punch of Skream's ""Midnight Request Line"" mixed into Benga's ""26 Basslines"" prove the secret to dubstep's appeal lies as much in jittery, restless, sometimes hyperactive (and danceable)<em> </em>rhythms as it does in ""dark"" atmospheric gloominess.</p><p>There are still a few water-treading, semi-onimous halfstep shrugs that might've sounded more revolutionary in 2006-- Caspa's ""Rubber Chicken""; Pinch's ""Punisher""; SP MC's ""Trust Nobody"" (which has the added disadvantage of being released in 2008). But in the context of this mix-- and thrown in with genuinely different cuts like Hijak's roots-dub throwback ""Dally"" and the euphoric closer of halfway-to-hardcore D1 cut ""Mind &amp; Soul"" (billed under its original title, ""Give It Back"")-- they manage to sustain the first disc's evocative mood of intense darkness punctuated by flashes of neon.<br/><br/>Geeneus plays things differently, and a bit more intriguingly: His disc has a keener focus on rhythmic elasticity than big heavy slabs of bass. There's still plenty of subwoofer fodder, of course-- the Bug's towering ""Skeng"", the dense buzz-pulse of Distance's ""V"", and some additional tracks from Skream (""Oskillatah""; ""Make Me""; ""2D"") and Benga (""E Trips""; Benga &amp; Coki's ""Night"") see to that. But Geeneus' selection has a lot more breathing room, with sprightlier drums and a heavier emphasis on vocal tracks to cut through the shadows. There are more vivid nods to dubstep's origins in UK garage, best personified by Martyn's breathtaking DCM Remix of TRG's ""Broken Heart"". And it hews closer to its Jamaican roots, whether in titular invocations of Rastafarianism (Kode9's ""Babylon""; Digital Mystikz cut ""Give Jah Glory""), dancehall vocals (""Skeng""; Coki's remix of Richie Spice's ""Burning""), and straight-up classic skanking riddims (Conquest's ""Hardfood""; the Digital Mystikz remix of Fat Freddy's Drop's ""Cay's Crays""). <em>I Love Dubstep </em>doesn't do a lot to point towards the scene's future, but its presentation of two different facets of<span>¬† </span>the scene-- dark and bright, dense and loose, brooding and danceable-- proves there's at least more than one way to get there.</p></div>"|12479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12479-i-love-dubstep/|7.4|Nate Patrin

In fact, it's tough by now to be surprised by much of anything these guys do. Luke Steele of the high concept pysch-pop outfit Sleepy Jackson and Nick Littlemore of dance duo Pnau, while taking divergent paths to Down Under pop stardom, are essentially kindred spirits bound by flamboyance and an odd idealism. Inspired by untold numbers of late nights and acid trips, at their indulgent best they strike a trenchant middle ground between fantasy and historical revisionism. Steele's big orchestras and Littlemore's whiz-bang saccharine samples both aspire to a grand sense of scale. A hundred bucks says each of these guys had a psychedelic 1970s country-disco epic on his back-burner anyway.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The title track, with its clubby beat and falsetto hook, seems like the kind of hit Steele has always wanted to write, but here he's found the right editor. Littlemore has evidently cleared a path for his partner, cutting through the relentless elaborations that adorned and perhaps encumbered the two Sleepy Jackson records. Steele may be his own worst enemy, his finger always poised at the ready on the overdub button at the chance of adding jangle to his overwrought jangle-pop. The addition of a co-composer has helped forge a bit of an uneasy truce in his frenzied psyche. Some cuts might even give rise to such simplistic fits of impulse as dancing.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Of course, let's not forget who we're talking about here. Luke Steele still effortlessly reminds everyone within earshot that he's <em>really</em> into himself. Like, <em>really</em>. He's the guy on the cover of the Sleepy Jackson's last record <em>Personality</em> as the bare-chested angel perched atop an Arctic ice field, austerely bearing in his arms the fetal, bare-chested figure of‚Ä¶ himself. This delusion of grandeur manifesests itself on <em>Walking</em>'s ridiculous cover, the epic spawn of <em>Star Wars</em> and ""Zoobilee Zoo"" raised straight out of promo poster hell. It seems a career spent in such indulgence can't just be streamlined overnight, because although Empire tries mightily, they collapse underneath too many ideas before the record is even half over. Same beast, new duds: instead of packing the arrangements with <em>Personality's </em>meaningless little fills, countermelodies, and interludes, the duo try their hand at genres they've apparently always wanted to do, like booty bass or yacht rock ballads. No wonder people buy individual tracks rather than full albums these days-- few buzzes die so abruptly as in the transition of the complex, ethereal melodies of ""We Are the People"" into the following cut ""Delta Bay"", which sounds like ""Thriller"" sung by cats.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If a metaphor could describe such an utterly puzzling sense of scale, it would surely fall somewhere in between throwing pasta at the wall and hunting the White Whale. Steele and Littlemore both seem incapable of diverging from their relentless quest for epic Meaning, but while some material is about as sublime and immediate as anything either has done, just as much crashes and burns. Thankfully, ""Tiger by My Side"" bulldozes the second-half wreckage with <em>Station to Station</em> swagger and a pounding, jammy Neu! beat. The song's impenetrable lyrics reference a fitting thematic menagerie of real and imagined beasts, and also may or may not have influenced the naming of Steele's six month old daughter Sunny Tiger, his first child with wife Snappy Dolphin. Seriously, you can't make this stuff up.</p></div>"|12484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12484-walking-on-a-dream/|6.4|Mike Orme

You can hear it in his fragile, warbly voice, if not always his somewhat glum songs. Strummy na√Øve C-86, lo-fi DIY, hyper-literate heart-on-sleeve twee-- oh, to have been born too late to partake in those forgiving and nurturing scenes while they were still alive and strong!</p><p>Needless to say, the Pica Beats seem a little out of place in 2008, if not outright anachronistic in their stylistic leanings (and borrowings). Yet despite this, there's such a relatively unassuming vibe running throughout their second album <em>Beating Back the Claws of the Cold</em> that it makes up for the fact the antecedents are so easy to discern. It sure helps that the band doesn't seem so bigheaded that it pumps up its low-key geek rock with misplaced portent. Instead, they are innocuously slack where other acts might have gone for wound-up. The rickety anti-sheen of the basement studio production gives the disc the feeling of something homemade and defensively modest, a token the shy new kid at school might slip into the lockers of potentially likeminded peers by way of indirect introduction.</p><p>That's the good news. The bad is that diffidence can only get you so far, and however fine a handful of individual songs may be here, the comprehensive end result is still oddly lifeless. Mellow might be the name of the game, but you can still sell songs with some conviction and spark without coming across as overconfident. There's a middle ground to be reached that's missed by the OK-enough title track or the otherwise standout ""Summer Cutting Kale"", which is just slightly more subdued than it needed to be to take advantage of the inner anthem waiting to emerge.</p>
<p>Even the few more vibrant tunes, like ""Shrinking Violets"" or ""Cognac &amp; Rum"", fall just short of all they could be, with the theatricality of the latter in particular failing to bring Barrett's narrative into sharper focus . Elsewhere, the occasional use of synths-- or, on the instrumental ""Martine, As Heavy Lifter"" and ""Hikkomori &amp; The Rental Sisters"", sitar-- seems less novel than frivolous, while songs such as ""Shallow Dive"" and ""Poor Old Ra"" never quite justify the flowery, erudite logorrhea they're meant to support. Smug though the band may be, at least the Decemberists deliver their literariness dynamically. With the Pica Beats, it's harder to connect with Barrett's characters and colorful descriptors when the songs themselves never quite fully come to life.</p>
<p>This is not to say Barrett and friends don't sound like they could be on the cusp of something a little more self-assured, but that's just it: <em>Beating Back the Claws of the Cold</em> only offers fleeting glimpses of potential greatness beneath the ho-hum surface. Right now the band (itself a relatively fresh and untested expansion on Barrett's originally solo conceit) comes off a tentative work in progress as well, a little too ensconced in its own little cocoon, in no particular hurry to get out.</p></div>"|12473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12473-beating-back-the-claws-of-the-cold/|5.7|Joshua Klein

Considering the anthropomorphic bent of the group's last full-length, <em>The Crane Wife</em>, it would seem Meloy has swapped maritime yarns for tragic critter fables as his prevailing field of interest, but that's a minor point.</p><p>More interestingly, and perhaps worryingly, is the ""rock opera"" part. Sure, it might be pulled off flawlessly, though something about the <em>RS</em> article's promise of ""crushing stoner-metal lurches"" leaves me a bit concerned. The Decemberists have always embraced their own inescapable pretentiousness, yet their saving grace was the self-aware lightness with which they carried their geekdom, at its best manifested in breezy dork-outs like ""Billy Liar"" and ""The Sporting Life"". By comparison, chunks of <em>The Crane Wife </em>felt turgid and overblown, indications that a band once wise enough to cordon off its most epic tendencies in ancillary standalones like <em>The Tain </em>EP had allowed the weight of ambition to partially sink its albums.</p><p>This year, the Decemberists released a series of three vinyl singles, joined under the shared title <em>Always the Bridesmaid</em>, that-- after the sometimes unwieldy <em>The Crane Wife--</em> offer a welcome return to more modest song forms. The first and most lyrically ear-grabbing of these six tunes is ""Valerie Plame"", a beseeching love letter to the infamously outed CIA operative narrated by an imagined confidant. Meloy's treatment of the Plame affair may seem a tad flippant considering the grave journo-ethical issues that go unmentioned-- and, shame about the unnecessary ""Hey Jude""-ish outro-- yet he nails perfectly the milieu of 21st century foreign intrigue, right down to references to Vespas and ""the Green Zone Marriott.""</p>
<p>Less thematically loaded but more compositionally satisfying is ""Days of Elaine"", which substitutes modern headline fodder for imagery of macabre decay that's more typical of Meloy's bent, touching obliquely on drink, drugs, and execution. Most importantly, the song is a rousing triumph of momentum, replete with a tight riff and providing an excellent conduit for its singer's reedy tones. That sense of putting melody and verbiage on equal footing carries over to the second A-side, the wistful ""O New England"".</p>
<p>A head-scratching cover of the Velvet Underground's ""I'm Sticking With You"" follows (why aim for charming artlessness when you're already interpreting one of rock's most famously unaffected moments?), but the series finishes strong with the 1-2 punch of ""Record Year"" and ""Raincoat Song"". The former performs the classic Meloy trick of conflating societal and romantic ruin, while the abrupt but evocative latter gives us a brief character sketch of a luckless spinster and delivers the best lyric of the whole collection, as Meloy wryly but heartrendingly opines that ""the raincoat you wore when it rained today/ I think it only made it rain more."" It's precisely such a moment of fine observation and quiet humanity that hopefully won't be lost if the Decemberists continue to make albums overweening with conceptual heft.</p></div>"|12470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12470-always-the-bridesmaid-ep/|7.0|Joshua Love

Naming the band inspired  debate. ""Bohren"" means ""drill,"" like what people do to other people in horror movies; ""gore"" means ""gore,"" like what seeps out of people when they're drilled, and like a Dutch instrumental band they all quite liked; and ""and der club of"" made them think of jazz. Jazz, they agreed, was cool. It was urban and dangerous-- they liked the <em>idea</em> of it. Stated influences were Black Sabbath and Sade. ""As I said,"" Gass confessed, ""we were drunk."" Cheers to auspicious beginnings.</p><p>The music Bohren makes is slow, quiet, and pretty.  It's too structured to be jazz and too vivid to be ambient, but it taps into the ideals of both. They play their instruments like they're worried of waking babies asleep at their feet. Christoph Cl√∂ser's saxophone parts leak from the bell of his horn. You can almost see Morten Gass wince as his fingers sink into his keyboard. Drummer Thorsten Benning lives with the task of supressing every teenage dream of beating the shit out his drumkit like the wild animal I suspect he sometimes wants to be. But in near-stasis, there's drama-- each beat becomes a cliffhanger for the next. Bohren don't play dead, they play mortally wounded.</p><p>They're the gentlest black metal band on earth. They're anti-social cocktail music. They're exotica, but only if we agree that vacant alleys are exotic places and lying face down in one of them would constitute a vacation. The restraint in their music creates as much tension as it does calm. At best-- 2004's <em>Black Earth</em>-- Bohren sound like they're passing through darkness, palms out and eyes open, in search of a lightswitch. It's the same eerie, bloodless quality of ersatz jazz that David Lynch depended on for club scenes in <em>Mullholland Drive</em> or Audrey Horne's twirling in ""Twin Peaks"", where the mellow becomes queasy and relaxation sours into uncertainty ‚Äì when what's supposed to relax you starts to actively <em>upset</em> you.</p>
<p>Creeps? First-rate. But they're strangely affectionate, too, a quality brought to the fore on <em>Dolores</em>, their sixth and latest full-length. Absorb the title and cover art-- a woman's name, glowing; moths pouring from the neck of some sexless, celestial being. It's cozy, leaden music. Songs have shortened to three or four minutes. Some of the melodies aren't just memorable, but actually hummable. Call this their ""standards"" album-- <em>More Near-Static Ballads of Death</em>'<em>s Sweet Embrace</em>.

And if we're to believe the rumors, Interscope emptied the bank to get them a Hollywood Hills crash pad where it could all go down. Blame it on the instructive misfortunes of the hipster rap movement the Knux like to claim they started, but not since the Game's <em>Documentary </em>has a hip-hop debut been more obsessed with Los Angeles celebrity culture or insulated from commercial failure-- hate it or love it.</p><p>It would be nice to separate the marketing of <em>Remind Me In 3 Days</em> from the record itself, but the marketing kinda <em>is </em>the story. But the Knux have a bulletproof first line of defense against beging dismissed as <em>Complex Magazine</em> fodder. Beyond the fact that they vaguely allude to some pretty serious criminal records on ""Bang, Bang!"" and ""The Train"" (their ""Cocaine Blues""), they can flow in ways that defy mere '88-deification. But it's not like their influences are any less obvious or critically acclaimed. Their high-NRG electro-funk has been likened to <em>Stankonia</em>, but a more accurate comparison is the lower-stakes artistic risks of <em>Speakerboxxx </em>filtered through <em>Southernplayalistic's</em> (mostly) party and bullshit concerns. And if that has you expecting an album's worth of ""We Luv Deez Hoes"", well...it's not too far off. Highlights like ""Fire (Put It in the Air)"" and ""Bang Bang!"" feature a similar mix of hands-up choruses, rock overtones, and agile raps that are playful enough (see the cruelly blueballed second verse of ""Cappuccino"") to counter the lapse into misogyny.</p><p>But where their heroes balanced crowd-movers with truly moving life lessons, the Knux follow up the early knockouts carelessly toggling between bromide and bromance. Tellingly, the standout is a BBD-meets-SAE new jack swinger about snorting past sexual inhibitions (""Powder Room""). While a consistent philosophy isn't a necessity on a debut album, you wonder who they're finding issue with. Like on their lost girl lament ""Shine Again"", a disturbingly hollow show of empathy to the women they brag about fucking on just about every other song. And then there's ""Daddy's Little Girl"", possibly the record's most immediate hook, with its female vocal that veers perilously close to latter-day Black Eyed Peas. Maybe they intended to fly low enough to hit their target, but it doesn't make it any more listenable, nor does its dissection of celebutante culture that digs no deeper than <em>Beverly Hills</em><em> Chihuahua</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>And yet, even though Knux lay claim to more traditional rap credentials than most of their peers, they also suggest that they're pretty much opting out of the rap game. Hoo boy, are there guitars on this, and they're played by the Knux themselves. But as much as this proves a facile marketing weapon, it just as often works to their disadvantage. The first time the six-strings pop up, they add a nice espresso jolt to ""The List"", functioning as a hook for a song that doesn't really have one, while ""Cappuccino"" and ""Bang Bang!"" are girded by grooves as thick and tightly coiled as bridge cable. But on ""Roxxanne"" and ""Hush"", the live instrumentation just functions as window-dressing to impress people who probably aren't all that familiar with guitar-based music. Names like Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party have been thrown out there. But the predominant sound is the palm-muted buffoonery found on the first N.E.R.D. album run through the kind of blown-out, rhythm-dulling, factory preset reverb and distortion tone that drives guitar store employees to think hard about grad school.</p>
<p>So, yeah-- for a record that's engineered to please everyone from crate diggers to rockist Luddites (namechecks: Johnny Cash 1, Ca$h Money 0) to ""all the skaters in Venice fucking with the Knux,"" <em>Remind Me In 3 Days </em>is every bit as likely to piss people off. While the first 20 minutes supply an appropriately cocaine-like high (with the requisite comedown), what's really missing is the debut they somehow skipped over, one where they could've showed where their passion comes from, rather than merely being actors in a <em>Hills</em>-hop hybrid.</p></div>"|12458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12458-remind-me-in-3-days/|6.7|Ian Cohen

And yet, though their sound has grown increasingly muscular, and their outdoor sets tend to only reach as far back as ""We Laugh Indoors"", they still seem ill-suited to wide-open spaces. As I watched two high-out-of-their mind, shirtless, thirtysomething acid casualties make out during Coachella while a rickety version of ""Soul Meets Body"" played in the distance, it just seemed to go against everything Death Cab has come to stand for. In other words, they still manage to carry themselves like a small band from a tiny Washington college town.<br/><br/>Upon re-release, the most striking aspects about Death Cab's debut, <em>Something About Airplanes</em>, were how modest it sounded and how removed it was from the Modest Mouse/Built to Spill template of the Pacific Northwest. If there was any resemblance to their regional forefathers, it was in their ability to create a sonic blueprint that's subtly innovative. Few were writing lyrics-- formed almost as complete sentences and melodically structured the same-- like Death Cab's Ben Gibbard at the time. The bridge of ""President of What?"" sounds like it's taking the wrong step with each chord turn, moving in an opposite direction to the melody, but the resolution makes complete sense: ""Nothing hurts like nothing at all/ When imagination takes full control.""<br/><br/>In a strikingly candid interview with <em>Paste</em> magazine, Gibbard admitted that he goes back to this record and rarely has any idea what he was talking about. While it's typical for a lyricist to embrace straightforwardness in his later years, recent tracks like ""You Can Do Better Than Me"" are no more rewarding for their directness. <em>Something About Airplanes </em>instead sounds like a private affair, which is one reason it's so treasured amongst diehards. Like so many other fledgling songwriters, Gibbard cloaked his voice in reverb and occasional distortion (even on the sweet and sour harmonies of ""Pictures in an Exhibition"") and danced around sentiment. For a band inextricably linked with heart-on-sleeve emoting, Death Cab could be delectably difficult to parse.<br/><br/>You can also hear how naturally and incrementally the group progressed from a fully formed blueprint. Regardless of <em>Narrow Stairs</em>' heavy-handed addition of new textures, you can trace a straight line to that point from the carefully considered guitar lattices of <em>Airplanes</em>' ""Your Bruise"". ""Sleep Spent"" is a direct descendent of mid-90s slowcore with better hooks. ""Amputations"", the most full-bodied track, features rumbling and almost mockingly chiming guitar hooks that sugarcoat the lyric ""he's unresponsive 'cause you're irresponsible""-- a stronger precursor to their more recent theater sing-along lines like ""you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me.""<br/><br/>While the deluxe package does include selections from their nervous first live show in Seattle and a cover of the Smiths' ""Sweet and Tender Hooligan"" featuring Harvey Danger's Sean Nelson, the real draw here is the chance to re-evaluate the band itself, often underrated or deemed as a group people ""used to like"" before getting into harder and more challenging music. And yet, while most of the indie crowd now embraces pop music in all its forms, something about dudes like Death Cab, who hit a little close to home but aren't considered ""cool,"" is still considered a dealbreaker. <br/><br/>Certainly, <em>Something About Airplanes</em> isn't Death Cab's best album-- in retrospect, it sounds like a dry run for 2000's <em>We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes</em>, where the lyrics got more pointed, the hooks more emphatic, and the dirges more steely and purposeful. The studio tricks would become more sympathetic as well: In addition to the dated samples that adorn ""President of What?"", ""Amputations"" closes with a snippet of a motivational record called ""You Can Better Your Best"" that proclaims ""if everybody's making fun of you or criticizing, you know you're on the right track."" Granted, the song itself is about the futility of becoming someone you're not to win someone over, but the line unwittingly serves as a mission statement for a band that went Gold while rarely answering to anyone but itself.</p></div>"|12466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12466-something-about-airplanes/|8.1|Ian Cohen

Thorpe's voice howls and thrashes, other times it actually sings or simpers or sighs, but only when he stretches it to the ceiling does it come into its own. His voice feels close in temperament to Antony Hegarty or Baby Dee's, but its mix of pointed sexuality and ambiguous gender points back to Boy George or David Bowie.</p><p>That indeterminate quality is the central theme of <em>Limbo, Panto</em>. Vocally, Thorpe plays with what idealized masculinity sounds like; lyrically, the band wants to know what masculinity feels like. ""Men to be men, must love and pity,"" Thorpe announces on opener ""Vigil For a Fuddy Duddy"". By<em> Limbo, Panto</em>'s end he's cursed Aristotle, gone for ""casual sex with a hard up thug,"" and sworn on his ""own cock and balls."" If there's a central character across these tracks, it's vice itself. <em>Limbo, Panto</em> is essentially a morality play as cabaret show as rollicking indie rock record. The Sunset Rubdown-like full-bodied pomp of ""The Club of Fathomless Love"" also runs down a series of rhetorical questions: ""I've sheened...have I not?/ I've Brylcreemed, have I not?/ I've length of loinly manliness, have I not?"" That speech oddity would sound appropriate in a camp, old-timey staging of Hamlet. <br/><br/>The funny thing is that Wild Beasts pull it all off with grinning, chirping enjoyment. True, lots of the tracks on <em>Limbo, Panto</em> use minor chords to enhance the casual depravity of its characters, but nearly all the guitars chime and sparkle. And others, like ""Woebegone Wanderers"", take on melodramatic halts and cabaret flourishes that render its subject matter comical. ""Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants"", originally recorded in 2006, still shows this. The band sound more aggressive on the re-recorded LP version: the beat more danceable, the title line shakier and more seductive. It's also Thorpe's most impressive vocal performance.<br/><br/>Underneath these filmy and seductive layers is not a band in limbo. This may be Wild Beasts' first album, but they've got a fully developed aesthetic, one that is thematically and vocally alien, but sonically, pop and conventional. Maybe a voice that bizarre needs something pretty to curl up on, but each song, whether a ballad or a romper (mostly the latter), generates enough turbulence to float with pockmarked elegance.</p></div>"|12450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12450-limbo-panto/|8.2|Jessica Suarez

It's the cloying, pedestrian soundtrack to holiday-shopping; it evokes unwanted memories of fretfulness and claustrophobia, of squabbling with harried salespeople, of trying to scrape ice off your windshield with a broken CD and no mittens while a midi version of ""Jingle Bells"" drips out of busted parking lot speakers. Still, that hasn't stopped a cabal of artists (My Morning Jacket, Sufjan Stevens, Rosie Thomas, Low, Bright Eyes, and plenty others) from earnestly trying to resurrect the genre for an audience more prone to tugging on ironic snowflake sweaters than belting ""We Three Kings"". <br/><br/>Julian Koster is best known as the banjo and saw player in Neutral Milk Hotel, and on <em>The Singing Saw at Christmastime</em>, his solo debut, he wields his saw for a series of classic Christmas songs, ranging from the silly (""Frosty the Snowman"") to the sublime (""O Holy Night""). The resulting LP-- 12 tracks of singing saw, exclusively-- is unsettling, bizarre, and, on occasion, exquisite. <br/><br/>Despite its relative ubiquity (you could dig up a playable hand saw in most American garages, although the just-for-singing kind tend to have the teeth removed, or at least filed down), the saw is actually tremendously difficult to play and control-- performers jam the handle between their knees, clutch the tip with one hand and a bow in the other, and attempt to twist and manipulate the body of the saw via a fated combination of vigor and prayer. Like a thermin, its tones can be unpredictable and sour, but when it sings properly, with muscle and clarity, there might be no other sound as ethereal and delicate, as alien and transfixing.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the saw is high and lonesome above all else, and it invariably evokes enormous wistfulness, a feeling which has a place in almost any Christmas celebration; on paper, Christmas is about miracles, but in practice, it tends to be a little bit more about longing, or, at least, self-contemplation. Consequently, hearing familiar songs-- songs so imbedded in our hearts and minds they can feel like extra limbs-- translated into a series of desperate, undulating yawns seems, at times, oddly appropriate (incidentally, it helps that ""Christ, being by far the most highly regarded and beloved carpenter of all time, was a great friend to the Saws,"" as Koster points out in the liner notes).¬† <br/><br/>The strongest tracks here are the ones where Koster layers his saws: ""Jingle Bells"" and ""White Christmas"" both feature genuinely stunning harmonies, although most of these tracks are remarkably spare, even vaporous-- the saw, used in conjunction with a full band, can add a compelling layer of weirdness, but on its own, it's vaguely terrifying (see, especially, ""O Come All Ye Faithful""). Consequently, <em>The Singing Saw at Christmastime</em> maybe isn't the best record to spin while prepping sweet potato pie with Grandma. But it is a remarkable feat of saw-wrangling, and an effective way to wind-down any holiday party: Nothing sends guests off into the cold night like a slow, warbly, saw-only rendition of ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"".</p></div>"|12463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12463-the-singing-saw-at-christmastime/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

They brought in Brian Eno to refine their bombast. They tried Bowie-style funk and shoegaze. They wore military duds that made them look like Arcade Fire. Everything seemed to be in place. But there was a problem: Coldplay's idea of cool and the cultural reality are two different things. This eight-track stopgap EP-- which doubles as a bonus disc on the obligatory <em>Viva</em> fourth-quarter deluxe edition-- allows for an assessment of Coldplay's 2008 ""We Are Edgy"" campaign. Can one daffy Brit and his personality-averse band bring the notion of cool closer to <em>them</em>?<br/><br/>Ostensibly, Coldplay know cool when they see it. They tapped operatic indie-rockers Shearwater and L.E.S. revivalist Santogold to open their world tour this year. Chris Martin is friends with Kanye West and Jay-Z, who contributes a verse on the <em>Prospekt's March</em> remix, ""Lost +"". Still, they lack the spontaneity, innovation, and effortlessness that usually accompanies edge-cutting phenomena. Take their recent performance on ""Saturday Night Live"": For a guy who's played to millions of fans at shows, festivals, and on TV, Martin came off like a clutzy ham not unlike former ""SNL"" mainstay Mary Katherine Gallagher. He was startlingly out of breath and made an effort to act out each of his simple couplets, all while yipping and hooting like a man poking fun at Tourette's syndrome. It was awkward, but kinda endearing. (<em>Defamer</em>: Coldplay's 'SNL' Freak-Out: Easy-Listening Performance Art, Awful, Or Both?)<br/> <br/> So when calm and collected artists like Jay-Z cite Coldplay as their favorite band, they're subconsciously subverting the same untouchable aura that bolsters their own coolness. It makes little sense, but it's worked for them thus far. On the overall hipness scale, Coldplay isn't close to, say, TV on the Radio, but in a weird way they're bringing a bumbling DIY aesthetic to emotional arena rock. And, just as <em>Viva</em> did an admirable job of troubleshooting the band's lazy weaknesses while expanding their sound, <em>Prospekt's March </em>offers a truncated version of their svelte and marginally progressive new formula. If this is the best Big Rock has to offer this year, we're doing okay. <br/><br/>As far as money-making mini-releases go, <em>Prospekt's March</em> is relatively noble, i.e., no quickie dance remixes, only one ""single edit"" (""Lovers in Japan"") and one piddly 48-second instrumental (""Postcards from Far Away""). All in all, half the EP is made up of completely new material that could've easily made the original  <em>Viva</em>. Talking about the EP a couple months ago, Martin quipped that the new songs ""might be considered too catchy or too heavy for Coldplay songs."" The heavy Coldplay song may seem like an oxymoronic concept, but ""Glass of Water"" makes a good case for the band turning up the volume more often. Granted, the whole thing centers around one of the very few Meaning of Life clich√©s Martin has yet to utilize (bet you can't guess exactly how much water is in that glass!), but the hook's brash guitars render his words unintelligible anyway.</p><p>With Eno behind the knobs, everything sounds pristine, impeccable. ""Prospekt's March/Poppyfields"" could pass for a latter-day Radiohead ballad (except Martin replaces Thom Yorke's doom with hopeful pleads of ""I don't wanna die""). With its micro-funk verse and symphony chorus, ""Rainy Day"" feels stiched together, but it's uniquely humble. ""I love it when you come over to my house,"" sings Martin, taking a break from explaining death and all his friends for a moment. Mostly instrumental <em>Viva</em> intro ""Life in Technicolor"" is morphed into a full-fledged song here-- and it in turn exposes the main obstacle in the way of Coldplay's desire to replicate U2 at their height. <br/><br/>Simply: Chris Martin needs to consider his lyrics more. He's smart; he can do better than ""don't you wish your life could be as simple as fish swimmin' 'round in a barrel when you've got the gun."" While Bono hasn't written an astounding lyric in ages, there was a time when his universal maxims rang true and felt close. Martin has shown flashes of this type of talent, but his consistency isn't where it needs to be in order for Coldplay to elevate to the supreme stadium-filling, critic-salivating level they so desire. With their revised sound and twitching energy, these sensitive lads are primed for something even bigger than their current little-kid-in-a-big-arena shenanigans. A few elegant, cringe-proof words couldn't hurt.</p></div>"|12467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12467-prospekts-march-ep/|6.0|Ryan Dombal

That about sums it up for these Jersey brats: redemption comes hand-in-hand with tailfins and Bogart. The Gaslight Anthem might work the Warped Tour mall-punk circuit, but they're not <em>of</em> it. Instead, they belong to an older breed of punk band, one we don't see to much anymore: Social Distortion, Alkaline Trio, fellow Jersey knuckleheads Bouncing Souls. These bands might be emotional, but they're about a million miles removed from <em>emo</em>, especially in the way that term gets tossed around now. These are the bands who sing in full-throated groan-man bellows, who unironically  cover old country songs, who heroically keep the hair-grease industry afloat. <em>The '59 Sound</em>, the Gaslight Anthem's sophomore effort, comes steeped in retro signifiers: pinball, Audrey Hepburn pearls, your hightop sneakers and your sailor tattoos. One song is called ""Film Noir"" and another is called ""Here's Looking at You, Kid"", redundantly enough. But all this fuzzy-dice Fonzie nostalgia, this glorification of an imagined era this band isn't old enough to remember, isn't a cheap hook; it's an ingrained and sincere part of their identity. ""I always kinda sorta wish I looked like Elvis,"" Fallon shrugs on ""High Lonesome"". And then, almost as an afterthought, ""I always kinda sorta wished I was someone else.""</p><p>The name that keeps coming up over and over when people discuss this band is <em>Born to Run</em>-era Bruce Springsteen, and it checks out. Fallon sings in the same sort of tremulous roar, and he's just as heroically unafraid of lyrical clich√©. He might even take it too far in ""Meet Me By the River's Edge"", which is literally about washing your sins away by the goddamn river's edge. But that wholehearted embrace of worn-in tropes is a huge part of this band's charm. The closest thing we get to circa-2008 hardcore is the strangulated NYHC backing bark that disappears as soon as it arrives on ""The Patient Ferris Wheel"". The way the band channels their heroes, everything feels flattened out into a heartfelt mush.</p><p>And because their inspirations are so internalized, the old songwriting tricks feel totally intuitive. The quiet-to-loud dynamics aren't forced, the ahh-ahh backing sighs come at the exact right moments, the church bells on the title track sound like god. These songs are simple, mostly, but they're executed perfectly. Fallon and guitarist Alex Rosamilia do this thing, mostly on the quiet bits, where their guitars wrap twinkly harmonies around each other, getting loose and intricate without being showy about it. And when the guitars turn into chorus-firepower, it just kills because it's been so long since we've heard anyone pull that off with such panache. If you've got even a tiny bit of a soft spot for that bruised-growl retro-punk, <em>The '59 Sound</em> is an answer to a prayer.</p>
<p>And then there's that title track. It's a sort of meditation on a dead friend, Fallon imagining what might've gone through his head in the final moments: ""I wonder, were you scared when the metal hit the glass?"" He wonders if the dead guy got to hear his favorite song on his way to whatever afterlife he might be headed toward. And then, as the song gets ready to end, there's this flattening bridge where Fallon repeats, almost to himself, over and over, ""Young boys, young girls, ain't supposed to die on a Saturday night."" It's simple, it's sincere, and it kills me every time.</p></div>"|12454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12454-the-59-sound/|8.6|Tom Breihan

As late as 1959, the liner notes for Numero's latest Eccentric Soul installment inform us, it was named an ""All-America"" city by the National Civic League. But as the 1960s rearranged the nation's landscape, East St. Louis sifted down to the bottom; before the decade was over, a quarter of its residents were unemployed, and many who did have jobs were underemployed. By 1967, street gangs and corruption-- as well as one of the nation's highest murder rates-- were all most Americans knew about the place that gave us Miles Davis.<br/><br/>In a city where all the wheels had come off so quickly, the challenges for kids who wanted to make something of themselves were understandably immense. Enter Jackson, Tennessee native Allan Merry and the South End Neighborhood Opportunity  Center. The son of teachers and an accomplished woodwind player who had toured or recorded with Curtis Amy, Ray Charles, Hank Williams Jr., and Little Richard, Merry was looking to settle, and the Opportunity  Center's mission of keeping kids out of street gangs suited him. At first, he fit in teaching kids to play baseball and working to bring more kids to the Center, but as his musical ability became more and more obvious, kids started showing up for that, too.<br/><br/>Faced with the influx, Merry had to figure out how to harness the creative energy of dozens of teenagers. He created a practice schedule and banned drugs and alcohol, recruited a local garage band to be the rhythm section, and generally made showing up worth the while of kids with no other artistic outlet. The whole conglomeration came to be called the Young Disciples, and in time, the funk-soul-jazz collective came to include male and female vocal groups (including the Primes and Primettes, coincidentally the same names that the Supremes and Temptations originally went by), funk outfits, solo acts, duos, dance troupes, and bands. The group had 30 members when it gave its first concert in October 1967. They played out, moved to a bigger practice space, recruited new members, traveled, secured grant funding and cheap equipment, and, finally, thought about recording.<br/><br/>By this point, it was 1969, and the Young Disciples were a local institution. The YoDi, Gateway, and Merry family of labels began recording in St.  Louis that year, and by 1970 they were able to book time in Memphis' legendary Sun studios. This continued through 1971, until the Young Disciples finally ran out of steam in 1972. So what does that recorded legacy sound like? Well, to say the handful of 45s the program left behind are worthy of reissue is an understatement. By the time they got into the studio, the Young Disciples, under any of the many names they issued 45s under, were a tight, forceful and imaginative unit.<br/><br/>""Crumbs from the Table,"" the A-side of the first Young Disciples Co. single is a stunning socially conscious funk workout. Larry Williams gives a raw, rhythmically dexterous lead vocal performance, the rhythm section is right on it, and the huge horn section sounds like a marching band thrilled to play something besides Sousa. The other Young Disciples Co. sides are from another universe-- ""Girls Girls Girls"" is a melodious soul ballad with great mixed-gender backing vocals, while ""Bang Bang Bang"" is an absolutely slamming party instrumental with a bit of cheerleader-ish chanting from the Primettes. Third Flight take their own pass at socially aware soul with ""Third Flight"", a psychedelic-tinged big band funk tune with astounding harmony vocals and a brilliant syncopated lead that tackles anti-cocaine lyrics.<br/><br/>The troupe's facility with hard-hitting, uptempo soul produces many of the disc's other highlights, including the Georgettes' uptown girl group swinger ""Hard Hard"", and the majestic psychedelic soul cut ""Homeboy"" by Eddie Fisher &amp; Allan Merry. The latter sounds like Sly &amp; the Family Stone sucked into a vortex with the Art Ensemble of Chicago and a German electronic group. The Young Disciples had a lot of range, though, as proven by the Ames Harris Desert Water Bag Company's spooky funk crawler ""People"", which has a paranoid, acid-damaged tone that heightens the intensity of the spoken mid-section describing an urban hellscape.<br/><br/>They also cut some excellent ballads in Memphis, principally Sharon Clark &amp; the Product of Time's sweet Southern soul tune ""I'm Not Afraid of Love""-- if you've followed the Eccentric Soul series, you'll notice that this fits right in with the string-laden female soul tunes they're so fond of showcasing, like Franciene Thomas' ""Too Beautiful to Be Good"". Perhaps the songs that sums it all up the best, though, is LaVel Moore's heavily orchestrated ""The World Is Changing"", which manages capture the monumental shifts American society underwent in the 60s and somehow stay hopeful about it.<br/><br/>Stories like Allan Merry's are what this series is made for, and this is a very rewarding Eccentric Soul volume, both for the story and the amazing music. It's good to think that most of the Young Disciples are still out there somewhere, carrying the experience forward with them. East     St. Louis could probably use the inspiration of knowing that if something like this could happen there once, it could conceivably happen again. As it stands, the Young Disciples remain a bright, if fleeting, chapter in the city's history, and the recorded legacy stands as proof that good people can make a difference when given the chance.</p></div>"|12447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12447-eccentric-soul-the-young-disciples/|8.2|Joe Tangari

Each member received equal songwriting credit on each track on each album, and reportedly each member not only had equal voice in decisions, but the band would do nothing unless everyone agreed unanimously. Theirs was a ""unique four-person democracy that in practice maximalized the talents and insights of four people rather than just one leader calling the shots,"" writes I.R.S. Records co-founder Jay Boberg in the liners for this new 2xCD reissue of <i>Murmur</i>, the band's first and best full-length. When the band triumphed, all of its members shared the acclaim; when it failed, everyone shouldered the blame. This was an atypical business model, but R.E.M. displayed a seemingly contradictory mix of egolessness and ambition. The group pointedly didn't appear on its album covers or inner sleeves; instead, R.E.M. remained confident that a kudzu-covered ravine or a folk-art painting could speak more strongly about their music than their own presence ever could. <br/><br/>Coupled with that air of mystery, R.E.M.'s practical democracy simultaneously stemmed from and extended to their music. They treated each instrument as essentially equal: Bill Berry's no-fills drums, Peter Buck's spiky guitar, Mike Mills' melodic bass, and Michael Stipe's grainy voice. Because these elements were characters in an equally weighted exchange, the remastering on this version of <i>Murmur</i> (overseen by Greg Calbi) makes it more than simply an anniversary repackaging, but a careful reconsideration that not only changes the lines of dialogue, but alters the entire conversation. Every unique strike of Berry's high-hat and snare becomes discernible, giving his rhythms greater urgency and force. Likewise, Mills' bass gets lower and richer, and his keyboard adds intricate textures to these songs: ""Pilgrimage"" is layered with reverberating low-end piano and vibraphone, and his honkytonk piano gives ""Shaking Through"" its country transcendence. Mills' backing vocals are emphasized to reinforce their point-counterpoint interplay with Stipe on ""Radio Free Europe"" and ""West of the Fields"". This new remaster doesn't throw off the band's equilibrium: The instruments are somehow now sound even more equal. <br/><br/>It does, however, shift the discussion slightly away from some of the typical influences ascribed to the band-- namely, the Byrds-- and toward the more strident sounds of British postpunk acts like PiL and Gang of Four, whom the band has cited as part of their inspiration but are often overlooked. This dimension of their sound is most apparent in Buck's fretwork; sure, it jangles, but that term has lost some of its evocative sheen through overuse. His guitar also chimes and shuffles and burrs and bellows its way through <i>Murmur</i>, giving ""9-9"" and ""West of the Fields"" their jitteriness.</p>
<p>Stipe sing-speaks aggressively through the former but, fortunately, the remaster does nothing to elucidate his vocals. No longer the mumbler heard on the <i>Chronic Town</i> EP, he enunciates more clearly on <i>Murmur</i>, yet there remains an unpracticed quality to his performance. Stipe switches between a wordless careen and a precise croon, reaching into his upper register on ""Radio Free Europe"" and into his lower on ""Catapult"". He indulges a slight yodel on ""Moral Kiosk"" and ends ""We Walk"" with a strange hiccup. Over the course of the album, his slur is more pronounced but still inscrutable, and he covers his lyrics in layers of ambiguity. <br/><br/>There's a historical component to <i>Murmur</i> that often gets lost: In 1983, R.E.M. sounded unique. No bands were combining these particular influences in this particular way, which made this debut sound not only new but even subversive: a sharp reimagining of rock tropes. Twenty-five years and 14 albums later, our familiarity with R.E.M. means that <i>Murmur</i> has lost some of what made it revolutionary upon release. Fortunately, rather than collecting obligatory bonus tracks and outtakes-- most of which would have overlapped with <i>Dead Letter Office</i>-- the set includes a second disc documenting a show in Toronto from July 1983, just after the album's release. It marks the first time a full R.E.M. show has been released on CD (<i>LIVE</i>, from 2007, was culled from two nights in Dublin), and judging by the intensity with which the band run through old and then-new songs, it could have held its own as a separate release. <br/><br/>It's startling to hear some of these songs stripped down to their four basic elements, with no keyboard or guitar overdubs. Likewise, it's a bit odd to hear only polite applause after ""7 Chinese Brothers"", which would appear on <i>Reckoning</i> a year later, and surprising to hear people scream for ""Boxcars"" and a cover of the Velvet Underground's ""There She Goes Again"" (which they play) and especially ""Shaking Through"" (which they don't). Live, Stipe deploys an even wider arsenal of vocal tics: vamping on ""Just a Touch"", growling the chorus of ""Talk About the Passion"", and sing-speaking through a jaw-dropping ""9-9"", all while Mills' backing vocals soar overheard and Buck's guitar chimes reliably on every song. Because they were known primarily as a live band, and because they built their identity as such when the industry avenues of promotion failed them, this live disc, much like the remaster, goes a long way toward re-creating for listeners the context in which R.E.M. introduced themselves and making these familiar songs once again excitingly unfamiliar.</p></div>"|12464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12464-murmur-deluxe-edition/|10.0|Stephen M.

Which leaves Black Milk on something of a singular plane-- he's just a <em>super </em>producer (and MC) with an album mindset, and <em>Tronic </em>just might be his boldest statement yet, far exceeding the modest nature of its Fat Beats origin.</p><p>In fact, <em>Tronic </em>could very well be the best end-to-end production job you've heard all year. It's hard to talk about anything Black Milk does without evoking J. Dilla, but even though there's a blatant nod here to the structure of <em>Midnight Marauders,</em> I'm hearing a real <em>ATLiens </em>vibe in the gorgeous, almost dubby undertow to the lunar sonics<em>.</em> The album cover is no ruse, as this is the most electro of Milk's productions, but he combines clubby textures and warm EQing in a way that begs for headphone listening even at its hardest knock. So the ""Knight Rider"" bassline of ""Bounce"" is counterbalanced by swirling, psychedelic keys and what initially sounds like an accordion on ""Tronic Summer"" turns out to be a sweltering vocoder.</p><p>Though in no way a concept album, <em>Tronic </em>is meant to be consumed whole and some of the interstitial moments are the most rewarding-- ""Losing Out"" tumbles into an erratic drum'n'bass beat reminiscent of the Roots' ""You Got Me"", while the sprightly strings that take up the final 20 seconds of ""Hell Yeah"" feel like a lost treasure. This is a Black Milk album, so you know the drums are going to hit hard, but a lot of tracks sound like he's imported ""Tekken"" combos into his MPC. There often isn't a traditional earworm beyond the way Milk interacts with his beats-- ""Give the Drummer Sum"" features a Quasimoto-like chant on the chorus, but the real hook is how Milk pulls tricks like dropping out the drums on the line ""let the organ get a stab at it."" He practically lives inside the beats, and ""Try"" is something of a conversation with a soul sample from an artist who promised to stay away from them (a concession similar to Kanye's intro on ""Everything I'm Not"").</p>
<p>But if you're wondering why that number up there isn't higher, well, here's the thing-- I'd hate to give Milk more reason to get defensive about his mic skills, since far too much of <em>Tronic</em> is muddled by saber rattling over haters who doubt his flow. First off, exactly which corner of the internet spends its time hating on Black Milk? Moreover, he's more than nice with his, considering that if he learned anything from Dilla, it's how to make electronically based hip-hop jiggle organically. That's some pretty bumpy mixed meter terrain he's able to traverse on songs like ""Hold It Down"" and ""Overdose"".</p>
<p>While he's every bit as thoughtful about his penmanship as he is about his production, Milk is nowhere near as adventurous. As was the case with <em>Popular Demand </em>and even the split he did with Fat Ray from earlier this year, you get the odd feeling that Milk put his heart into his work, and yet it feels slightly impersonal, save for the career summary ""Long Story Short"". Beyond his battle rhyming, he most frequently rails against the current state of hip-hop, but his lines are so vague that they actually fail to indict anyone. Even while the kiss-off of hangers-on ""Without U"" resembles Slum Village at its most softbatch, the topicality, at least, is welcome.¬†</p>
<p><em>Tronic </em>usually finds Milk's humility working in his favor, however, since he has no qualms about being a facilitator. Royce Da 5'9"" breaks hip-hop's silence on Kwame Kilpatrick and absolutely shreds ""Losing Out"", and ""The Matrix"" is pure Soundbombing bait for those stuck in the one-nine-nine-nine: a reinvigorated Primo scratches while Milk trades verses with a typically old-man strength 16 from Sean P and Pharaohe Monch dropping a spectacular dud of a punchline likely causing agita at a message board near you (""Like pants legs around the ankles of hipsters-- I'm tight!"")</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it makes me think back to something Wale spoke to on ""The Perfect Plan""-- ""Instead of singing our praise they do/ Raise the bar to a level unattainable."" But it's to Black Milk's credit that so much is expected out of him. Maybe he's got the Detroit <em>Chronic </em>in him-- something with Elzhi (where's he?), Royce, and fuck, who's Eminem getting beats from these days?-- but for now, <em>Tronic </em>is one hell of a holding pattern.¬†</p></div>"|12451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12451-tronic/|7.9|Ian Cohen

Over the course of their last few months together, the Florida-based trio blazed across the U.S. like a Molotov cocktail, playing the same 10 or so songs over and over and over. Their earlier records had mostly been unrepeatable experiments; this time, their repertoire had reproducible phenomena, and they proved it by cranking out recordings of it. There was an untitled studio record, sometimes simply called <em>Fuck You</em>; there were a handful of singles reprising the same material; there was <em>Live at Salon Zwerge</em>, <em>Live Fuck Love Songs</em>, and finally <em>Live</em>, a blistering document of their final show on May 5, 1997. <br/><br/>This 42-track compilation includes most of those records, which means a lot of the same titles recur. (There are five versions of ""Smash the Mirror"", for instance; the 18-minute <em>Salon Zwerge</em> is an extended take on ""Mandolin"", which appears in three other versions.) Perversely enough, that makes it more listenable rather than less. Hear a late-model Harry Pussy song once, and it sounds like a formless blurt-- a blast of noise that everyone somehow manages to stop playing at the same time. Hear it a few times, and you'll start to hear the joints and folds in it, and the way it falls into shape. Hear three or four or five different takes on it, and it usually turns out to be a through-composed structure. <br/><br/>The spurting heart of the band was singer/drummer Adris Hoyos, for whom ""singer"" and ""drummer"" aren't really adequate descriptions. Hoyos screeched so hard it's tough to imagine how she ever spoke afterwards, alternating between a roar of pure wronged loathing and a stabbing-victim squeal; her job on the drum kit wasn't to keep a beat, but to flail the living shit out of it until the song was over. Bill Orcutt and Dan Hosker, both hammering at detuned guitars, took their cues from Hoyos's voice-- it's a kick when they suddenly fall into a rhythm at the end of ""Sex Problem"", as Hoyos's free-form screams about loneliness and ambivalence resolve into a chant of ""I like girls, trust me. I like girls, trust me. I like girls, trust me. I like girls, trust me. I like girls, but sex scares me."" (It's regrettable that this reissue doesn't include lyrics; they're good, and they're not often intelligible.) <br/><br/>As a sort of conceptual grounding for Harry Pussy's idea of songwriting, there are a handful of apropos covers here: a half-strangled take on O.D.F.X.'s twenty-second ejaculation ""Drop the A Bomb on Me"", a reasonably faithful version of Teenage Jesus &amp; the Jerks' ""Orphans"", a Neanderthal reduction of Kraftwerk's ""Showroom Dummies"". But the core of the album is their own final, distilled, impossibly corrosive songlets, and the bloodthirsty, rageful glee Hoyos brings to them. In the middle of their final show, Hoyos calls for ""Chuck!"", a song they'd played four minutes earlier. Orcutt and Hosker evidently give her a quizzical look. ""<em>CHUCK!</em>"", she announces again. And off they go.</p></div>"|12449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12449-youll-never-play-this-town-again/|7.2|Douglas Wolk

But <em>Canopy Glow </em>is close enough in sonic character to its predecessor that its<em> </em>release on hip-hop label Anticon feels like one of the oddest pairings in recent years.</p><p>The immediate difference on <em>Canopy Glow </em>is Anathallo's decision to slim down while somehow getting their weight up-- in the time it takes to read this review, you might watch only two <em>Floating World </em>song titles scroll across an iPod screen; most songs feel padded beyond six minutes, something you might expect on a record centered around Japanese folklore. Like much of <em>Canopy Glow, </em>""Noni's Field"" takes its time emerging from its reverby cloak, but after the sleep is shaken out it builds to a rousing chant that sets the stage for LP highlight ""Italo"". Title aside, it's less Sally Shapiro than Sufjan Stevens, as Anathallo subtly mix fractured meters and a dirgey minor progression that gives the track an unsettling undertow.</p><p>Such grounding is rare on much of the record-- like a band class show-and-tell, Anathallo go gonzo for every instrument except bass, leaving wispy tunes like ""Northern Lights"" and ""John J. Audubon"" to float rudderless. In a foolhardy or thoughtless bit of self-promotion, Anathallo liken themselves to a ""marching band gone wild"" (at least it's not ""on acid""), which is unfortunately inaccurate on two fronts. <em>Canopy Glow </em>often lacks the propulsion that could inspire couch-bound channel surfing, let alone marching-- which is pretty inexplicable for a band that claims six out of its seven members as percussionists. And even as indie's obsession with orchestral arrangements appears to wane, there's still nothing particularly wild about <em>Canopy Glow</em>'s puffy souflees-- though some fawn over the fact they have toured with two glockenspiel players, those guys need to actually <em>do </em>something other than come off like baroque-pop SW1s.¬†</p>
<p>Still, Anathallo are learning on the job, even if they seem bound to play, at best, second fiddle/banjo/bassoon to Sufjan and his crew's increasingly suspicious absence. Too many of Anathallo's peers from the aborted blog uprising of 2006 took a lack of immediate success defensively and ungracefully bowed out, so it's heartening to see them so willing to ride this bells-and-whistles thing until the wheels fall off. And really, hanging out with an unexpected patron saint like Yoni Wolf can probably only lead to good things (particularly since he knows how to make a xylophone bump). But for the time being, the unnatural and unnerving smoothness of <em>Canopy Glow </em>shows that if there was any one Anticon record that deserved to be called <em>Alopecia</em>, it's this one.</p></div>"|12461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12461-canopy-glow/|5.3|Ian Cohen

This impasse is the ideal moment for band members to make¬†low-key solo albums focusing on the core elements that make their bands great, just as Thom Yorke did with <em>The Eraser</em>.</p><p>Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor does just that on <em>Rubbed Out</em>, a refreshingly simple collection of tender ballads and quirky set pieces. It often feels like catching Hot Chip songs half-formed-- it's easy to imagine how they'd shape up with syncopated percussion and filter sweeps, and many of them are so striking that you might wish for similarly stripped-down versions of ""Boy From School"" and ""Look After Me"". The sentiment veers between giddy infatuation and discreet heartbreak, but the mood stays quietly devotional throughout. Taylor's voice hovers over rich keyboard smears or bounces lightly over tripping guitars, accented with little bells and whistles.</p><p>The hooks come hard and fast over <em>Rubbed Out</em>'s delightful first two-thirds. ""Fireworks"", an engaging squelch-and-static instrumental, serves as a quick warm-up for ""Plastic Man"", a winsome organ hymn on which Taylor sings unabashedly about ""the heart that is inside of me."" A fluttering electric guitar version of Paul McCartney's ""Coming Up"" follows, and by the time you get to the hopscotch-pop of ""Baby"", you'll be charmed. Other front-end highlights include silky ballads ""I Thought This Was Ours"" and ""What Good Is Love?"", while ""I'm Not a Robber"", with its skittering drums and keyboard sheen, is the closest thing here to a Hot Chip song.</p>
<p>This 15-track album starts to taper off around ""Musical Food"", one of a couple of pointless drone pieces that pad <em>Rubbed Out</em>'s confused final third. I'm all for drone pieces in general, but Taylor's knack is for razor-sharp pop, not murky ambiance, and his talents feel especially wasted here. We also get brief sketches that might've been cool had they been finished (although one, ""I'm Juan"", features some unusually ugly synth sounds), and a closing work-out for booming drums. These pieces feel tacked-on, which their sequencing as the last six tracks supports.</p>
<p>The parallels between Taylor's <em>Rubbed Out</em> and Yorke's <em>The Eraser</em> go beyond big-band auteurs making intimate solo albums. Consider their titular references to deletion-- of bandmates, of ornate arrangements, of instrumentation, and most importantly, of pressure. Taylor and Yorke seem to have had the same idea-- as their bands threatened to become moribund, they needed to get back to basics. For Radiohead, this re-centering was the pivot between <em>Hail to the Thief</em> and the revivified <em>In Rainbows</em>; hopefully the parallels will continue and <em>Rubbed Out</em> will have the same effect on Taylor's next album with Hot Chip.</p></div>"|12460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12460-rubbed-out/|6.7|Brian Howe

""I feel that, especially now with the Internet and paparazzi and camera phones, it's so difficult to maintain mystery,"" she said earlier this year. ""It's almost impossible to have superstars now, because people will never get enough."" And, in our TMZ-addled world, her reluctance to entertain most questions about her personal life is both refreshing and a bit stubborn. She's a megawatt anachronism in sky-high heels and a frozen smile. So, without much outside interference, Beyonc√©'s fan-artist connection relies almost wholly on her music-- the only place to find the ""real"" Beyonc√© is on her albums. With that direct relationship in mind comes <em>I Am... Sasha Fierce</em>, a supposed window into the soul of Beyonc√© as well as her hair-flipping sexpot alter ego who happens to be blessed with the ultimate ""Project Runway"" moniker. <br/><br/>The ""split-personality"" gimmick is now a tired and, more often than not, hapless pop theme (see: Garth Brooks's proto-emo character Chris Gaines, <em>T.I. vs. T.I.P</em>, the street vs. boardroom dynamic of hubby Jay-Z's <em>Kingdom Come</em>). <em>Sasha Fierce</em> will not disturb that unfortunate trend. Unlike 2006's underrated funk-fest <em>B'Day</em>, which held together remarkably well as an LP and saw Beyonc√© ditching sap for sass, this record isn't supposed to coalesce. Speaking once again to her penchant for the outdated and obsolete, it's a 2xCD affair also available in a deluxe edition with five additional tracks. (Didn't anyone tell her about Christina Aguilera's recent diva-fied double disc disappointment <em>Back to Basics</em> ... and that you're supposed to put the deluxe edition out six to eight months <em>after</em> the regular edition?) <em>Sasha Fierce</em> puts Beyonc√© back into the ""singles artist"" column-- only the blindly devout would consider slogging through the deluxe edition multiple times; only the foolishly puritanical would deny the occasional high-gloss super hits. <br/><br/>Nobody wins the Beyonc√© vs. Sasha battle-- often, the listener loses. On the Beyonc√© side, while tracks like the effective (and affecting) gender-bender ""If I Were a Boy"" and the stunning love-as-god power ballad ""Halo"" (courtesy of ""Bleeding Love"" scribe Ryan Tedder) find the singer both strident and exposed, there's lots of wispy nonsense seemingly dug out of Celine Dion's scrap pile. Her twist on ""Ave Maria"" is vocally impeccable, but it reads more like recital fodder rather than a true confessional. Flip to Sasha, which is more listenable overall, but also more pandering. There's the one that sounds like past Beyonc√© hits (""Single Ladies [Put a Ring on It]""), the one that sounds like ""A Milli"" (""Diva""), and the one that sounds like Rihanna (""Sweet Dreams""). For someone famous for effortlessly sparking trends, there are a surprising amount of opportunistic retreads here. <br/><br/>Beyonc√© is a capital-S Star, and one glimpse of her onstage makes it clear why she's earned her right to operate above the fray. But an album isn't a concert, and there are simply not enough <em>Sasha Fierce</em> songs worthy of her or our time. (The hopelessly benign ""Smash Into You"" will provide a prime bathroom break moment on her next world tour, though.) While this LP is more painstaking than <em>B'Day</em>, the extra effort dulls any emotional wallop; <em>B'Day</em>, in all its hectic glory, offered a much more vivid peek into the elusive mind of Beyonc√© than <em>Sasha Fierce</em>, which often reads more like projection than reality. Considering the wealth of characters this multi-talent is currently amassing between movies and alter egos, the notion of Beyonc√© is more splintered now than ever. <em>Sasha Fierce</em> doesn't help her put the pieces back together.</p></div>"|12462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12462-i-am-sasha-fierce/|5.7|Ryan Dombal

But Jones' performance felt less like a resurrection and more like a return, comet-like. After all, how can a personality as huge as Jones' ever really vanish? She might slip off to the side, but she's never really gone. <br/> <br/> All the same, <em>Hurricane</em> is Jones' first new album in nearly 20 years. And unlike her revered early material from the 1980s, which found her reinventing and often outright owning songs by the Normal, Pretenders, Iggy Pop, the Police, Tom Petty, and Roxy Music, <em>Hurricane</em> features all originals, each a Jones co-write at that. Yet Jones' collaborators clearly had a notion of what songs-- and what sounds-- would be a good fit for her, and space-age riddims seem to be it this time around. In fact, at first the disc almost seems to be returning the favor to Bristol's best, sometimes sounding like a tribute or lost sequel to Massive Attack's <em>Mezzanine</em>, recreating that oddly timeless album's dubby menace. <br/> <br/> But the resemblance may be mostly coincidence, a product of circumstance. At least some of <em>Hurricane</em> was reportedly recycled from several sessions stretching back as far as a decade, including the titular first single, a Tricky collaboration. He's not alone among the disc's many guests, either, which include Brian Eno, Tony Allen, and the indomitable Sly &amp; Robbie, always Jones' greatest ally, foil, and support team. But this being Grace Jones, she easily upstages her contingent of helpers. Indeed, Jones isn't so much a singer as a force of nature, a black hole that pulls all attention right to its center. Or, to invoke the more terrestrial metaphor of the album's title track: ""I can be cool, soft like the breeze/ I'll be a hurricane, ripping up trees!""<br/> <br/> That nicely sums up the album's dual strengths, with Jones taking charge as one-woman wrecking crew but, more surprisingly, occasionally ratcheting things down to an introspective and intimate level as well. Jones also proclaims that she can give birth to sheep, so her particular brand of crazy is never far behind. But if it's Jones' kookiness that keeps her so interesting, it's her instinct for strong material that makes her so compelling. Surely, as far as reintroductions go, the opening ""This Is"" is killer, its relentless dancehall pulse as ear-catching as Jones' angular form is ever eye-catching.<br/> <br/> Immediately, however, the Wendy and Lisa co-write ""Williams' Blood"" reveals a new, explicitly autobiographical side to Jones, as she pays tribute to her mother Marjorie and the gift of music she passed down to her daughter. The track is a tour de force, from its turn to the dark and electric to its passing quote of ""Amazing Grace"". ""Corporate Cannibal"", at one point the title of the album, is stranger but also slightly aware of its own ridiculousness. ''I'll consume my consumers, with no sense of humor,"" Jones growls, before kicking into throbbing low-end gear. ""I'm Crying (Mother's Tears)"" is slower and suppler, giving Jones a chance to hit a few notes as she once again honors her mother. <br/> <br/> From here on out, <em>Hurricane</em> is classic Jones. ""Well Well Well"", ""Sunset Sunrise"", and the creeping ""Love You to Life"" are all reggae-rock hybrids that would fit any year in the past 30, and the pummeling slo-mo electro-dub of title track a statement of purpose if ever there was one. ""Devil in My Life"" ends the disc on a restrained industrial note, its lyrics apparently drawn from an evening spent people watching at a party. Grace Jones, people watching, ceding the spotlight and staring from the sidelines? Now that's a shock. That Grace Jones would finally break radio silence with a disc this exciting is somewhat less so.</p></div>"|12453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12453-hurricane/|7.5|Joshua Klein

Or to be really reductive, the same long track. Such sweeping dismissals aren't entirely misguided: Wilderness relentlessly and, yes, perhaps redundantly have their own thing going on. To Wilderness fans, however, that thing the band does-- ominously pitched post-rock-- is mostly compelling, often mesmerizing, and occasionally sublime.<br><br>Of course, becoming a fan means a willingness to submit to James Johnson's assaultive yowls and Colin McCann's lacerating guitar. Wilderness aren't just offering daft indulgences, though. As others, including <strong><a href=""/article/feature/10306-profile-wilderness"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork's Brian Howe</a></strong> have suggested, they're a serious, cerebral outfit aiming to exorcise their collective anxieties. And despite the band's two-year hiatus, <em>(k)no(w)here</em>'s incremental shifts-- slower tempos, starker arrangements, and the addition of McCann's high, keening backing vocals (which, somewhat disconcertingly, recall Journey's Steve Perry)-- advance the drama.</br></br></p><p>""High Nero"" opens the album with a pensive ambient wash, setting up the jolting entrance of tom throbs, reverbed guitar, and vocal wails all the more jolting. Will Goode and Brian Gossman's superb rhythm section has been overshadowed by Johnson's emoting, but it's pretty close to centerstage on <em>(k)no(w)here</em>. ""Soft Cage""'s meticulous drum patter and cool, stalking bass are reminders of why this band earns favorable Fugazi comparisons. And thanks to a deliberate and measured rhythmic core, ""Chinese Whisperers"" sounds more ragged and sprawling than anything Wilderness have done, .<br><br>An even more subtle development-- ""subtle"" because Wilderness' lyrics are rarely intelligible anyway-- is Johnson's growing distrust of language. The singer's culture-jamming, anti-capitalist lyrics have never relied much on grammar and syntax, but at points in the record he eschews familiar or even representational sounds altogether. This makes more sense when you consider that <em>(k)no(w)here</em>'s almost-continuous song stream (notched into eight individual tracks on the album) was composed to support visual artist Charles Long's <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_smKO7vgm4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">installation at this year's Whitney Biennial</a></strong>. Long previously collaborated with Stereolab, and if you've seen the artist's playful yet melancholy junk assemblages and bird excrement sculptures, the partnership holds a kind of logic. In fact, now that they've literally made art-rock, perhaps that will close the loop on the band's singular aesthetic and we'll get a fourth album that doesn't sound, to the cynics, exactly like the other three.</br></br></p></div>"|12457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12457-knowhere/|7.2|Amy Granzin

Just like the Miami loudmouth, Statik has a nice thing going, consistently releasing surprisingly enjoyable, guest-crammed compiations. Some crucial differences, though. Unlike Khaled, Statik mostly avoids screaming bullshit all over his own tracks. I'll also take Termanology, Statik's personality-free rapping prot√©g√©, over Ace Hood, Khaled's personality-free rapping prot√©g√©. And even though most of them are trapped in either major-label limbo or indie-label hell, Statik's guests generally sound like they're having more fun than the gazillionaires on the Khaled albums.<br/><br/><em>Stick 2 the Script</em>, Statik's sophomore effort, might not make too many year-end lists, but two-thirds of it provides a remarkably solid listen-- thanks in large part to Statik's production. Statik's beats are mostly Premier-inspired boom-bap, which nobody seems to do well anymore. But Statik knows what he's doing: scratchy choruses, chopped-up drums, occasional flourishes of horn or guitar. Lead single ""To the Top (Stick 2 the Script)"" has a weird cut-up hotel-jazz beat that somehow stays propulsive because of those drums. The State Property half-reunion ""All 2gether Now"" has a great little ominous churn with fuzzed-out synth-squeals over the top. And even the token Houston-rap track ""Get Out the Way"" stays with the boom-bap blueprint rather than shooting for imitation Rap-A-Lot house production. In fact, the only time Statik leaves his wheelhouse is on the G-funk experiment ""Cali Nights"", which is sort of a disaster.<br/><br/>As for the guests, there's a big divide between the veterans who've actually had radio play and the new-jack torch-carriers destined for obscurity. Older guys like Redman or CL Smooth have an innate understanding of how to mix technical skill with big-room charisma. Jadakiss murders ""For the City"" with matter-of-fact coldness: ""Bullets, gunsmoke, and cocaine residue/ Leave me the fuck alone, that's what you better do."" The State Property guys, who were flirting with stardom just a few years ago, come particularly animated, especially Peedi Crakk: ""I got a natural get-at-you flow/ It's like a animal, a cannibal, call me Hannibal Crakker, whoa!"" And, on ""Mr. Popularity"", Kanye associate Consequence redeems a corny concept (he uses the word ""pop"" as much as possible) with pure plosive-exploding technique.<br/><br/>As for the newer guys...meh. There's a whole lot of bitching about the current state of rap, mostly because guys like Saigon are mad it's not particularly hospitable to guys like, say, Saigon. ""Streets of MA"" is the all-Boston posse-cut nobody outside of New England was anticipating. And if you ever wanted to hear a for-the-ladies track from random mixtape types like Skyzoo and Joell Ortiz, well, you're fucking insane and I'm scared of you, but there's one here.<br/><br/>But even the lamer moments are mostly inoffensive, and they're over quickly. <em>Stick 2 the Script</em>'s 18 tracks fly by in a brisk 53 minutes-- not even Termanology gets a chance to hog the mic too much. The record's mostly pure amber nostalgia-- there's even a Mad Rapper skit-- and it's not going to pull hip-hop's focus off the South, but I wouldn't mind hearing a couple more of these Statik Selektah albums. That's something I can't say about DJ Khaled.</p></div>"|12456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12456-stick-2-the-script/|6.6|Tom Breihan

On <em>Dedication 2</em>, the second in the series of reputation-cementing mixtapes Wayne made with DJ Drama, he explained: ""I am better than everybody. I'm a competitor. I hope everybody else feel the same way about their craft. If you do, it makes it better for the people."" So that was it: In an era of hustlers-not-rappers, Wayne was one of the few who took his occupation seriously, who put in 16-hour days coming up with the sort of word-drunk, out-there punchlines that made the world take him seriously. In a few years' time, Wayne went from a goofy Southern kiddie-rapper to a force of nature.</p><p>Fast forward to this year: <em>Tha Carter III</em> is the biggest-selling album of 2008 and also one of the most acclaimed-- in part because Wayne put so much work in. Note the past tense: Wayne no longer has anything to prove, and <em>Dedication 3</em>, his new Drama mixtape, sounds like it.<br/><br/>Wayne is very good at a few things: rapping, picking beats, making goofy facial expressions in videos. He's not especially good at playing guitar or singing or selecting rappers for his record label. But those other things seem to be monopolizing his attention these days. There's no guitar on <em>Dedication 3</em>, thank God, but we get a whole lot more of Wayne's off-key Auto-Tuned warbling than we get of his actual rapping, and he mostly leaves the rhyming to his Young Money Entertainment signees, which anyone who's heard Mack Maine's shockingly clumsy guest-verse on the ""Got Money"" video knows is a bad thing. When Wayne does get around to rapping, he usually sounds like he's fried his brain on so much cough syrup that he can barely bring himself to stick to the beat or come up with more than one good line.<br/><br/>This is a circa-2008 DJ Drama mixtape, which means the beats, both new and vintage, will be top-notch and well-sequenced, but it also means Drama's <em>own</em> weed-carriers Willie the Kid and L.A. the Darkman will be along for the ride.  The title track sets the tone: Over Drama associate Don Cannon's pretty-great beat for Outkast's ""Da Art of Storytelling, Part 4"", Wayne gargles out an unmemorable chorus while Willie, Mack Maine, and Gudda Gudda spit boringness; Wayne jumps on at the end for a quick afterthought of a verse. This is the <em>first track</em>, and it goes on for nearly <em>seven minutes</em>. Things don't get a lot better from there.<br/><br/>Every big-name rapper these days has a crew of associates, but only a few-- T.I. and Kanye-- have ones worth hearing. But, hey, these guys need to rap somewhere, so it might as well be on a free online mixtape. Still this is a <em>Dedication</em> mixtape, and listening to all three of them in order tells a sad story. The last two featured Wayne, hungry and fearsome, ready to take over the world through whacked-out genius and force of will. This time, he's barely paying attention. Example: ""Get Bizzy"". The track snatches the simple, spacey, orchestra-hit-heavy beat to V.I.C.'s ""Get Silly"", exactly the sort of low-budget novelty-hit that the Wayne of two years ago would've just <em>annihilated</em>, the way he did to Dem Franchize Boyz' ""I Think They Like Me"" on <em>Dedication 2</em> or DJ Unk's ""Walk It Out"" on <em>Da Drought 3</em>. This time he drools all over the track in a half-conscious Auto-Tuned slur, loses the beat a couple of times, comes up with exactly one slick line (""Red scarf on my neck/ Red diamonds looking like red barf on my neck, uhh""), then turns the whole thing over to the unbelievably shitty Plies sound-alike Gudda Gudda. Epic fail.<br/><br/>More bad decisions: Tyga, the squeaky-voiced younger cousin of Gym Class Hero Travis McCoy, gets pole position on Drumma Boy's gothically churning beat for Young Jeezy's ""Put On"" and he absolutely sucks. Nondescript prot√©g√© Nikki Minaj, meanwhile, gets to defile the beat to T.I.'s ""No Matter What"" so she can complain (in Auto-Tune, guh) about the haters she's not famous enough to have. And for the first time, a Wayne signee-- Jae Millz, journeyman veteran of the New York mixtape and battle circuits-- upstages his boss. Millz isn't a great rapper, but he's got a no-bullshit monotone flow and a way with punchlines: ""Y'all nothing like me, fuck boy, don't be outlandish/ We gorillas in the mist, y'all just some kung fu pandas."" Here and there, we get brief flashes of the truly nasty Wayne, but we have to wade through so much bullshit to find these gems that it's barely worth the effort. One of Wayne's most entertaining moments comes on a non-rapping skit where he's just talking about Sarah Palin-- and he even loses focus near the end of that.</p><p>We've been here before. The first time Wayne started fucking around with Auto-Tune was on another near-unlistenable mixtape released near the end of last year, Empire's unlicensed <em>Da Drought Is Over, Part 4</em>. When I heard that, I wrote that Wayne might need to slow down, that his appetites and his volume of output were finally starting to bring down the quality of his work. Wayne pulled it together for <em>Tha Carter III</em>, and a handful of post-album guest-appearances (Drake's ""Ransom"", Keri Hilson's ""Turnin' Me On"") show that he's still a monster when he wants to be. But when he stops wanting it, we get bullshit like <em>Dedication 3</em>.</p></div>"|12444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12444-dedication-3/|3.7|Tom Breihan

With a tradition of vinyl singles, small but beloved labels, and an intense sense of community, indie pop fans tend to place value on singles and EPs as much as albums. And with a decade and a half of reliably charming singles, EPs-- and, yes, albums-- the Lucksmiths are kind of like their genre's dependable go-to; they're the Hold Steady of indie pop.</p><p>You know what to expect from the Australian band's ninth album, <em>First Frost</em>, and as with Craig Finn &amp; co.'s latest, <em>Stay Positive</em>,  you also a get a few new wrinkles. Stand-up drummer Tali White sings a little bit softer now; the guitars crunch more often. But the songs-- written mostly by guitarist Marty Donald, though also by White, bassist Mark Monnone, and newer guitarist Louis Richter-- are still genial sing-alongs that bounce from languid introspection to scrappy exuberance. Covering familiar subjects like the weather, drinking, geography, and quiet melancholy, they delight with catchy tunes and understated eloquence. <em>First Frost</em> doesn't match the peaks of 2005's <em>Warmer Corners</em> or last year's 45-track <em>Spring a Leak</em> compilation, but it comes close.</p><p>Recorded in Tasmania with Chris Townend, the album continues a gradual sonic exploration: Horns and glam-rock swagger help Donald's ""A Sobering Thought (Just When One Was Needed)"" clear its head, while an unexpectedly grinding guitar solo lets White's acoustic ""Up With the Sun"" move beyond ""a time when every lunch was breakfast."" Monnone's ""South-East Coastal Rendezvous"" comes about as close to the wavy guitarscapes of <em>Strawberry Wine</em>-era My Bloody Valentine as the Lucksmiths probably ever will, evocatively concluding, ""Here's to who knows what"" (alas, not ""when""). Strings nicely adorn slower songs like Richter's opening ""The Town and the City"" and Donald's similarly themed ""Pines"". ""I don't mean to suggest I'm getting older/ But the city looks better over my shoulder,"" goes the latter.</p>
<p>If it sounds like the Lucksmiths that wrote happy-go-lucky songs like ""Under the Rotunda"" and ""T-Shirt Weather"" have grown up...well, they have, but their craft has matured, too. They still ""drink and laugh and eat,"" as on Monnone's folkier, slightly drab ""Day Three of Five"". Only now they're left to ask themselves, ""Why did you get drunk"" in Donald's mournful, country-tinged duet with female vocalist Bee Rigby, ""Lament of the Chiming Wedgebill"". No, wait, it's the chiming wedgebill who's asking.</p>
<p>Most admirably, <em>First Frost</em> finds the Lucksmiths continuing to put out quietly ambitious records that could be enjoyed by almost anybody who loves music-- not just indie pop partisans. ""California in Popular Song"" is the best song on the album, but it's not a difficult critic's favorite; either you'll love the trebly guitar interplay, White's tender phrasing, Donald's vivid storytelling about someone leaving for an imagined California, and delicate turns of phrase like ""your eyes are wet with wine,"" or you'll listen to something else. Yes, I realize the poetically arranged SAT-word sing-along that ends Donald's gorgeous ""The National Mitten Registry"" is waaay too precious for the Hot 100. But as White sings: ""Fingers crossed/ All is not lost."" The Lucksmiths still drink; they haven't dried up, and it doesn't sound like they're going to crumble into dust anytime soon.</p></div>"|12442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12442-first-frost/|7.6|Marc Hogan

Soon after recording the heralded <em>Grimm Robe Demos</em> a decade ago, amp-and-volume addicts Stephen O'Malley and Greg Anderson had the good sense to realize that slow, distended riffs-- no matter how quaking, visceral, and charged-- could quickly wear down a band. To that end, Sunn O))) have collaborated with dozens of avant-garde and metal heavyweights over six full-lengths and a bevy of EPs, live takes, and joint releases. From noise paragon Merzbow and ex-Melvins/Earth grinder Joe Preston to contemporary allies Boris and Xasthur necro Malefic, an impressive horde have left their mark on Sunn O)))'s colossal doom.</p><p><em>D√∏mkirke</em>-- a vinyl-only, 2xLP set recorded in March 2007 in a 12th century Norwegian cathedral-- showcases Sunn O)))'s malleability and versatility. Here, Anderson and O'Malley are assisted by four auxiliary members: Attila Csihar, the enigmatic vocalist of black metal band Mayhem; Steve Moore, the Southern Lord horns-and-keyboards specialist who now plays in Earth full time; longtime Sunn O))) collaborator Tos Nieuwenhuizen; and Lasse Marhaug, an Oslo electronicist whose work as Jazkamer spun glorious noise from metal threads on 2006's <em>Metal Music Machine</em>. The Borealis Festival-- an artistically adventurous affair spread throughout venues in Bergen, Norway's second city-- commissioned the piece to mirror ""the gothic Gregorian hymns of the Late Middle Ages... [which] reflected the despair, the terrors and darkness of the world."" Oh, the irony and possibilities...</p><p>But what's so special about <em>D√∏mkirke</em> isn't that it was made by tattooed guys in dark robes playing doom metal in a beautiful church-- it's Sunn O)))'s crafty manipulation of spaces, aural and architectural, and the manner in which they relate to one another. The group uses its full sonic breadth here, saturating the space with a smart array of sounds. During ""Cannon"", the music even seems to mimic the cathedral's arches, as rich bass, horn, and organ support Marhaug's razor-thin electronic squeals.</p>
<p>Before <em>D√∏mkirke</em>, Csihar had appeared on three Sunn O))) tracks-- two on last year's <em>Oracle</em> and ""Decay2 [Nihil's Maw]"", the tortured 25-minute conclusion to 2004's <em>White2</em>. Those tracks were good but one-dimensional, picking a sound and exhausting it. Here, the tracks seem to build, collapse, and sometimes rebuild through a wide range of tones and timbres, from the classic Sunn O))) guitar/bass upheaval to sonorous horn and organ calls. Csihar's criss-crossing moans, screams, and roars benefit from the more intricate sonic foundation, and his performance proves dynamic and, in its own way, narrative.</p>
<p>Totaling 64 minutes, these four tracks showcase an almost litrugical arch: Opener ""Why Dost Thou Hide Thyself in Clouds?"" is a staid but powerful invocation, Moore building a viscous pipe organ drone that Csihar slowly slithers through. ""Cannon"" greets the rising action as Anderson and O'Malley join with low, long bass and guitar notes, and Moore slides trombone hums between the cracks. The upheaval of history or religion or really big amps in a stone-walled room finally comes to pass during ""Cymatics"", where noise, electronics, and Csihar's screams converge, with feedback flailing above a massive bass and barely-there organ. That organ is the only thing left at the close of ""Masks the √Ütmospheres"", which feels like a summary of the performance's musical themes.</p>
<p>Any review of <em>D√∏mkirke</em> would be remiss without commending Southern Lord's dedication to presenting its records as non-disposable pieces of art: <em>D√∏mkirke</em>, which isn't available digitally, comes pressed to sturdy charcoaled-and-veined vinyl. Each record slides into tough paper sleeves covered with gorgeous, theatric stills from the performance, and those sleeves slide into opposing wings of the thickest gatefold packaging I've ever held. A shadowy canvas painting by Burzum/Darkthrone artist Tanya Stene graces the front, representing the menacing sermon offered by the robed men on the back cover (O'Malley, Anderson and Csihar) from the darkened altar pictured in the haunting cathedral panorama stretched across the inside gatefold. There's a poster and a number, too. Released in a recorded music industry that's barely limping past its centennial, <em>D√∏mkirke</em>'s material and musical hulk reflects the strength of anything that's survived 850 years of change.</p></div>"|12434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12434-dmkirke/|7.3|Grayson Currin

Throughout the remainder of their short career, they'd have to settle for mere admiration while their more genre-conformist peers enjoyed wider recognition both critically and commercially. None of that was the band's fault: There's nothing willfully difficult about Adorable, the most overtly pop band to have been classified as shoegaze.<br/><br/><em>Footnotes 92-94</em>-- which culls 18 tracks from the band's early EPs and two full-lengths, the aforementioned <em>Against Perfection</em> and the sadly neglected follow-up, <em>Fake</em>-- represents the first attempt to give this band its much-belated due. <em>Footnotes</em> opens with early single ""Sunshine Smile"", which with its radiant guitar lead and whooshing chorus pegged them early as shoegazer disciples. While it's the track Adorable is remembered for, it also captures the band in its least-inspired and most embryonic form.<br/><br/>Adorable made a significant leap from ""Sunshine Smile"" to <em>Against Perfection</em>, which notably did not include that early effort on the UK version of the album. On the Creation Records debut, Adorable retain some of shoegaze's aesthetic qualities, the saturated choruses and random bursts, but it's the elements that set them apart from their label peers that most impress in hindsight. Where vocals had been relegated to mere sonic accoutrement in shoegaze proper, Piotr Fijalkowski opted to take a front seat on<em> Against Perfection</em>, keeping his vocals well above the din. In contrast to the then-prevailing convention, which prized words for syllabic structure or how well they matched the music's dreamy somnolence, Fijalkowski seemed driven by a desire to convey raw emotion, no matter how clumsy the articulation. The approach reached its zenith on ""Glorious"", which here appears in slightly altered form, but still displays all of the brash egotism and crippling self-doubt (""there's a whole world outside that I didn't know about, I don't need it"") that made Fijalkowski stand out amongst the legions of breathy, vague impressionists.<br/><br/>Predictably, <em>Footnotes</em> draws heavily from <em>Against Perfection</em>, featuring eight of the album's 10 tracks. (The two left out are ""I Know You Too Well"" and ""Still Life""-- both wisely jettisoned for this release.) An unfortunate side effect, however, is the exclusion of equally deserving songs from <em>Fake</em>-- particularly ""Road Movie"" and epic closer ""Have You Seen the Light"". The band's second album was in many ways as much a departure from <em>Against Perfection</em> as that album had been from ""Sunshine Smile"". Rather than continue further down the Britpop path (which they might easily have done with the groundwork laid on <em>Against Perfection</em>), Adorable instead chose to explore their growing fascination with American indie, adopting sludgier guitar tones and a more narrative lyrical approach for <em>Fake</em>. The shift perhaps explains why the album never found favor in England.</p><p>Nevertheless, <em>Fake</em> was quite an achievement. The more propulsive songs, like opener ""Feed Me"" and the single ""Vendetta"", effectively underscored Fijalkowski's sneering, pointed delivery. Even more impressive were the slower numbers, such as on the incandescent ballad ""Submarine"". For once, Fijalkowski's vulnerability was matched by his band's more nuanced approach, one that emphasized the empty expanses, less over more.<br/><br/>Rounding things out are a few odds and ends, lesser known B-sides that are neither embarrassing nor worthy of special mention. Cherry Red deserves credit for releasing this career-spanning retrospective, if for no other reason than for getting these songs in wide circulation. But truthfully, the label would have better served the band by simply reissuing the albums. <em>Footnotes</em> may work as a general introduction but falls short of a worthy epitaph.</p></div>"|12439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12439-footnotes-92-94/|7.2|Jonathan Garrett

He left after that group's first album and the jittery R&amp;B-nodding two-step beats from the first record more or less went with him. (No insult to the opulent mope of <em>So This Is Goodbye</em>, not that it even needs mentioning.) Not surprisingly, the production on <em>Stereo Image</em> performs the similar feat of moving both the feet and the brain while things eminently tasteful and chic and making it all look easy.</p><p>The vocals are another story. San Serac sings on every track here, and this probably isn't the best context for his voice, which is both technically limited and dramatic to the point of camp. Sometimes his presence is easy to overlook. Opener ""Pack Moves"" is an uptempo barrage of wet, bassy synths and tea-kettle percussion, and when Dark puts forth comparatively feet-first-head-later tracks, silly lyrics and sillier delivery can't do much to dampen the mood. When the album veers toward Grade-A mid-tempo swoon like ""Your Collapsed State"", the vocal approach begins to grate; things get worse on sparser minor-key material like ""Strange Life"", where Serac sings in an utter deadpan about promoters sipping white beers and names of mid-level sedans as if they were newly-unearthed Ian Curtis lyrics.</p><p>It's only on tracks like the sleek ""Exposure"" or the obvious standout of ""Red Nights"" that Serac has a back-and-forth with the track rather than smothering it. During the latter's loopy middle-eight, he gets in an impassioned plea: ""No sad-sack DJ's ever gonna bring us down."" Now, Stereo Image made it to Junior Boys' recent <em>Body Language</em> mix, so there's probably nothing to read into there; but given its placement on the record, and the tone of this whole album against Junior Boys' trajectory without Dark, the comment can't help but sound a little pointed, if not defensive.</p>
<p>The thing is, Dark is all over the place on <em>Stereo Image</em>, trying out different sounds. Only on ""Your Collapsed State"" does he dip back into the sparse and bated mystique of earlier Junior Boys material. The bright tones and relentless percussion elsewhere can sound like a woozy, paranoid recast of big beat, and ""Dark Chapter"" and ""Clamoring"" are icy to the point of near-gothic. An instrumental version of <em>Stereo Image</em> would be an event in itself, but Serac struts over every track like it's up to him alone. His speak-sing delivery on ""Red Nights"" fits ably with the wistful chirpiness of the track, like he and Dark are smiling in the face of some adversity. But it's about the only moment here where he shows more than one note.</p></div>"|12428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12428-stereo-image/|4.0|Jason Crock

From the start, they resisted putting on common shows, eschewing pubs or clubs for libraries and churches-- venues that made their performances atypical and unbound to live clich√©s. Because they performed infrequently in wildly different settings, however, it took time for B&amp;S to hone their live show. The tentative steps charmed some: Writer/musician Franklin Bruno, in an enthusiastic email that was eventually excerpted in the zine <em>Puncture</em>, praised B&amp;S in part for not ""overpreparing"" for their first U.S. show. In a review of the same gig, <em>The New York Times</em> admitted to loving the songs but called the band ""lazy, unambitious bumblers full of private jokes they're too sleepy to share.""</p><p>Despite the slapdash nature of some early shows, the group sounded polished on its early radio sessions. It's fitting: Band leader Stuart Murdoch has decried the need to over-amplify music at rock shows, and Belle &amp; Sebastian's earlier, baroque lines are better suited to the intimacy of bedroom listening. As a kid weaned in part on John Peel's UK radio show, Murdoch seemed to understand that portion of his audience as well, dedicating one song on an early radio performance to a smalltown girl ""because life isn't easy for a 16-year-old in the middle of nowhere.""</p><p>It took a while, but Belle &amp; Sebastian eventually performed on Peel's show three times: They cut previously unreleased songs at a session in 2001, added a five-song set at Peel Acres in 2002, and played a set heavy on holiday music later that same year. The first of these is included on <em>The BBC Sessions</em> in its entirety, alongside 10 of the 13 tracks the group performed for Mark Radcliffe and Steve Lamacq in 1996 and 1997. (A limited-edition version of the album adds a 12-track live disc recorded in Belfast in 2001, capturing the group in its transitional middle period. Bolstered by additional string players and finding their feet as entertainers, they even frequently performed covers, with ""The Boys Are Back in Town"", ""I'm Waiting for the Man"", and ""Here Comes the Sun"" making appearances on this disc.)</p>
<p>The first half of <em>Sessions</em> features faithful renditions of early songs like ""The State I Am In"", ""The Stars of Track and Field"", and ""Judy and the Dream of Horses"". Since the group recorded their first two albums, <em>Tigermilk</em> and <em>If You're Feeling Sinister</em>, in a total of 10 days, it's no surprise that they could replicate the studio tracks but do little more. Even 1997 recordings of ""Slow Graffiti"" and ""Sleep the Clock Around""-- each performed more than a year prior to their studio release-- appear largely as listeners now know and love them.</p>
<p>Without guest vocalist Monica Queen, the band is forced to make adjustments to ""Lazy Line Painter Jane"". Guitarist Stevie Jackson replaces her vocals and the arrangement is dialed back, with the song sashaying rather than soaring until an aggressive coda that single-handedly saves it. Jackson also offers two originals-- the drab ""Seymour Stein"" and an early version of countrypolitan charmer ""The Wrong Girl"" (here as ""Wrong Love"").</p>
<p>This is an incomplete look at these sessions, leaving out a trio of songs recorded in December 1996 which included ""Seeing Other People"", a lovely version of ""This Is Just a Modern Rock Song"", and ""We Rule the School"". The disc also cuts off ""I Could Be Dreaming"" before it gets to its rousing coda. The missing ""Seeing Other People"" is the ""slow version"" the group often played at its earliest shows-- including that divisive one in New York-- which featured Murdoch, Jackson, and Isobel Campbell trading verses. Campbell's vocals sound breathless on the radio show, as she displays little vocal control, gasping for air between words and syllables. Despite that, it's still a worthy artifact.</p>
<p>More sadly missed is an exquisite reading of ""We Rule the School"", which swaps around some of the lyrics and has a tangible ache to it, even greater than the studio version's. ""I Could Be Dreaming"" drops out Murdoch's closing ad-lib, wherein he laments tongue-in-cheek that the group signed a record deal rather than continuing to orchestrate their career on their own. Like ""Seeing Other People"", it's perhaps awkward for the group to hear these early gestures, but they're sweet and missed here nonetheless.</p>
<p>The final four tracks are also the last songs the group recorded with Campbell, and her vocal ability had grown incredibly over the time. With an already spectral quality to her now-matured voice, her presence would seem almost ghostly were the first of the four-- a tribute to the wonderful Go-Bewteens-- not already haunted by the subsequent death of that group's co-songwriter Grant McLennan. One of the closest things in the B&amp;S catalog to a Stuart Murdoch solo song, Go-Bees tribute ""Shoot the Sexual Athlete"" finds him speaking in first person without talking through a character, something he does only when making meta comments on the nature of the group or stardom.</p>
<p>On both ""The Magic of a Kind Word"" and ""Nothing in the Silence"", Campbell shares vocals with her bandmates but looms large. The former points the way to the happy-clappy sound of <em>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</em>, while the dreamy, drony latter hints at some of the many directions Campbell would take her music once she left Belle &amp; Sebastian. Best of all is ""(My Girl's Got) Miraculous Technique""-- which most harks back to the songs B&amp;S recorded in 1996-97. ""If I could be a song/ I would be something that would snake into your room/ And be with you the whole night long,"" Murdoch and co. sing here, making it a fitting finale for both a radio session and a disc full of them.</p>
<p>It's also a fitting epitaph for the group in 2001, just before it was prepared to jump fully into the Technicolor, Trevor Horn-led world of <em>Waitress</em> and ditch the coziness and privacy of spinning gorgeous melodies for loners, dreamers, and students. That makes it all the more a shame this collection couldn't find room for ""We Rule the School""-- the song dedicated to that 16-year-old girl-- and a few other moments beloved by fans. Childhood and adolescence aren't always pretty-- there are missteps, embarrassing photos, inept sexual fumblings, and poor choices. It's a slight disappointment that a group so in tune to the awkwardness of youth would paper over some of those moments and leave this set incomplete.</p></div>"|12443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12443-the-bbc-sessions/|7.9|Scott Plagenhoef

Their 1979 commercial breakthrough, <em>At Budokan</em>, is not just one of rock's greatest live albums, but also one of its most triumphant underdog tales, an exemplar of pre-internet viral phenomena: Originally planned as a cheaply produced, limited-edition Japanese-only release, the record eventually-- through steady import sales, airplay from discerning stateside DJs, and increasing request-line activity-- transformed these bar-circuit workhorses into multi-platinum superstars. They really don't make 'em like this anymore.<br/><br/>Of all the 1970s arena-rock acts, Cheap Trick were arguably most in tune with punk's premium on three-chord simplicity, raw-powered riffage, subversive lyrics, and plainclothes appearance. Sure, vocalist Robin Zander and bassist Tom Petersson were pretty boys, but unassumingly so; the real center of attention was Rick Nielsen, whose geek-chic attire and hammy onstage antics made him a class clown in an era of golden-god guitar heroes. Meanwhile, Bun E. Carlos looked less like a rock'n'roll drummer than a veteran cop pulling desk duty. Though Cheap Trick's most visible recent moves-- re-recording Big Star's ""In the Street"" for ""That '70s Show"", performing the Beatles'<em> Sgt. Pepper</em>'<em>s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> in its entirety at a 2007 Hollywood Bowl concert-- may paint them as a nostalgia act, they continue to produce quality albums (see: 2006's steady-as-she-goes <em>Rockford</em>), and their influence on contemporary indie/alt-rock is as pronounced as ever: For the Foo Fighters, Weezer, Smashing Pumpkins, Ted Leo, the Raconteurs-- basically any band that's ever tried to weld a Beatlesque melody to a power chord-- all roads lead back to <em>Budokan</em>.<br/><br/>However, this 3xCD/DVD, 30th-anniversary box set makes for an overlong and somewhat unnecessary return trip. For casual/curious fans who just want their ""Surrender"" and ""I Want You to Want Me"", the original, compact 10-track version of <em>At Budokan</em> (reissued on 180-gram vinyl last month) remains the most convenient access point. For those who want the band's pop hits counterbalanced by more aggressive album cuts like ""ELO Kiddies"" and ""Auf Wiedersehen"", there's <em>At Budokan: The Complete Concert</em>, a 1998 2xCD remastered reissue that compiles the best performances from the Trick's two Budokan performances on April 28 and 30, 1978. And now we have <em>Budokan!</em>-- a repackaging of the reissue that contains the <em>Complete Concert</em> set, a third disc featuring an unedited performance of the complete April 28 show, plus a DVD document. <br/><br/><em>Budokan!</em> earns its newly acquired exclamation point with the DVD portion-- the second of the band's two Budokan performances was filmed for Japanese television and allegedly broadcast just once, making this footage a prized acquisition for long-time fans. Though contextual/crowd shots are non-existent-- thereby denying us the opportunity to experience the full magnitude of the band's Beatlemania-like reception-- it's still a treat to see those iconic album photos come to life, and witness a band being promoted to arena-rock big leagues right before your eyes, with no bullshit or pretense. (The closest thing to a pyro effect here is the stream of smoke emanating from Carlos' cigarettes.) Curiously, the video of ""Come On, Come On"" is excised from the main set and relegated to a bonus feature, perhaps because the footage was originally overlaid with an interview segment; it's appended by two clips from Cheap Trick's April 2008 return to Budokan (the <em>Dream Police</em>-era power ballad ""Voices"", and <em>One on One</em>'s ""If You Want My Love"") that show them more aged and less limber, but with their harmonic fortitude intact. A retrospective interview featuring the band and its Japanese handlers provides additional backstory-- sobering reminiscences of fan-induced rioting and hotel-room segregation that contrast with the celebratory spirit of the recordings. <br/><br/>As a stand-alone item, the DVD would make for a great stocking stuffer, and a practical way to commemorate an anniversary that was already well-commemorated 10 years ago. But to package it exclusively in a $50 box-set-- one that will ward off younger Cheap Trick newcomers while essentially saddling the die-hards with another copy of <em>The</em> <em>Complete Concert</em>-- seems a bit churlish. For non-audiophiles, the unedited April 28, 1978 audio disc provides only the most minor points of contrast-- a flubbed guitar-solo break during ""Come On, Come On"", a version of ""Surrender"" minus the familiar synth over-dubs. Otherwise, the set list (even the stage banter) is identical to <em>The Complete Concert</em>, which, as per its design, already features the band's best Budokan performances. Perhaps the lure of a handsomely bound liner-note 40-page booklet (complete with an uncharacteristically humble shout-out from Gene Simmons) and souvenir poster will allow some fans to forgive this box set's redundancies ‚Äî though judging by the complaints currently spreading online about the set's disc-scratching, slip-case packaging, they may have other issues. In any event, for a band whose greatest attribute was their economy, <em>Budokan!</em> feels excessive-- a repackaging trick that's not so cheap.</p></div>"|12441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12441-budokan/|6.5|Stuart Berman

If you're interested in Prurient, <em>Arrowhead</em> is a revealing transitional retrospective, intense but with precedent. If you're not, it's a shocking, singular piece of hair-raising noise. Either way, it's yet another essential piece in Prurient's metastasized catalog and one of the year's most obliterative and exhilarating releases.</p><p>Originally recorded in 2004, <em>Arrowhead</em> consists of three squelch-and-sustain tracks built by high-pitched microphone feedback, challenged only by spasms of drumming and the mutilated screams of Prurient mastermind Dominick Fernow. He infamously employed a similar approach-- a thin, powerful shriek of feedback that slowly warps and expands until it blooms into a boundless abyss-- on ""Roman Shower"", the brazen first track from his 2005 Load Records debut, <em>Black Vase</em>. Though exceptions abound, much of Fernow's recent output has been more ""song""-oriented, meaning only that the settings have generally been shorter and less of a standstill (see the excellent <em>Pleasure Ground </em>or the second side of <em>Adam Tied to a Stone</em>).</p><p>In that historical setting, <em>Arrowhead</em>-- recorded the same year and in the same city as ""Roman Shower""-- links many of the facets of Prurient's sound. In the first two tracks, Fernow gradually intensifies sinister, relentless rays until, like ""Roman Shower"", they become pained, bloody wastelands. The third and shortest track lunges forward, slowly becoming caked in static and sliced by feedback similar to that heard during the first 27 minutes. All the sounds smear, wiping across the speakers like a grimy, gory mess. Imagine Daniel Menche pushing the Fuck Buttons on speed, for four minutes, and you get the point. Together, these tracks-- ""Sternum"", ""Ribcage"", and ""Lungs""-- show us where Prurient had been in 2004 and where he was delightfully going.</p>
<p>If this release serves as an introduction to Prurient, it'll be a trial by fire, but one well worth the burns. Sure, you'll find noise ""bigger"" than this, but you'll find little that's so dramatic and masterful. Listen for the control Fernow wields over his electronics as he grapples with the tone, letting it slide into chaos only to bring it back under his hand. There's a violent, lacerating ebb-and-flow to this work that's as nauseating as it is enrapturing.</p>
<p>Both in his Manhattan record store, Hospital Productions, and through his record label of the same name, Fernow peddles the most extreme black metal, a genre that-- at its best-- delivers an idea without apology and with exhaustion. Prurient sounds little like black metal here (with its drowned vocals and saturated, tidal murk, <em>Cocaine Death-</em>- another excellent 2008 release from Fernow-- does; and he's in a black metal band, Ash Pool), but <em>Arrowhead</em> functions in much the same way: Its stylized, specific, and unflinching sound roars with a singular menace, at once terrifying and captivating. These performances sound like the sorts of pieces that happen when every ounce of trouble the performer has gets sweated, bled, and screamed into the cutting room floor. Re-reading that sentence, I'm afraid I've made Prurient's searing power-electronics sound, well, emo. And I suppose, in the end, it is. But for 31 minutes, <em>Arrowhead</em> should keep you too fixated (or, as it were, repulsed) to care.</p></div>"|12427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12427-arrowhead/|8.8|Grayson Currin

Every divisive Out Hud or Radio 4 release felt kosher if uploaded onto the same iPod playlist with at least one obscure cut from, say, Liquid Liquid or DNA. Even when enough mind-blowing dance-punk releases finally elevated the genre above fad status, these stubborn, joyless touchstones occupied a big part of listeners' consciences. San Francisco instrumental quartet Tussle are apparently among the few who haven't received the memo that there's big bucks in semi-artistically fusing dance and rock music together. They cling to their influences on a purely cerebral level, making no effort to coddle listeners not already immersed in the genre.<br/><br/>Tussle's first two LPs cast the group more as connoisseurs than revivalists, but <em>Cream Cuts</em>, as its name tantalizingly suggests, seeks to derive at least some degree of pleasure from the band's otherwise sterile precision. Tracks like the bubbly ""Night of the Hunter"" tap into the NES-informed instrumental rock of the Octopus Project or Hella's <em>Chirpin' Hard</em>, and are aided by the playfulness of percussionist Jonathan Holland, who's willing to clang together anything he finds in the junkyard. Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor even makes a cameo, spreading his pop wealth over ""Titan"", by far the brightest and loosest song here.<br/><br/>This healthy dose of accessibility also spills over into the spacebound portions of the album. ""Transparent C"" pays homage to expansive trailblazers Cluster and Kraftwerk, while the group's dub and Manchester leanings resurface on the song's Happy Mondays-style outro. ""Rainbow Claw"", the cr√®me de la <em>Cream Cuts</em>, reaches the most effective compromise between Tussle's right and left brain. Updating the intergalactic siren from ESG's ""UFO"", ""Claw"" batters its austere bassline with legions of synths, causing the Martian groove to occasionally fly off-course into a wonderful B-section freakout that's at once carefree and meticulous.<br/><br/>Of course, this newfound immediacy is all relative. Throughout the album, Tussle continually ride up to the line of release, but then pull back, like when they short circuit ""Meh-Teh""'s potentially huge pay-off with a wonky noise collage tangent. Even more confounding, they plop aimless interludes like ""Third Party"" and ""Personal Effects"" between album highlights, which begs the question of how big a scope Tussle's aiming for. The band's superhuman patience and dirty minimalism seem fit for longer, more sprawling works. Instead, they're stuck in limbo between catchiness and craftsmanship.</p></div>"|12431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12431-cream-cuts/|6.5|Adam Moerder

For those folks, the appeal of the musician's bizarre personality and alleged craziness overwhelms the legit brilliance, turning it from a sideshow into the main attraction. Lee ""Scratch"" Perry has hovered on the periphery of that divide since the end of the 1970s: as much deserved recognition as he gets for his production innovations, there's also the ""he burned down his <em>studio</em>, man"" aspect of his legend, the stories and rumors that tend to depict him as a cannabis-fueled goof-off and, with age, a sort of crazy-grampa oddball persona as well.<em></em></p><p><em>Scratch Came, Scratch Saw, Scratch Conquered</em>-- the second album Perry has released in the span of two months, coming shortly after the Andrew W.K.-produced oddity <em>Repentance</em>-- should suit fans of Scratch-as-weirdo just fine. His role on this album is in a purely vocal capacity, and even if his voice is mostly preoccupied with croaking out stream-of-consciousness mutterings and aimless non-sequitirs, he still shoots off a few good lines: Opener ""Having a Party"" invokes ""A skeleton from outer space/ With his Remington in his suitcase,"" and when he gets abstractly spiritual on tracks like ""The Game Black"" and ""Saint Selassie"", he seems to harbor a compellingly odd sort of mysticism. And there's still a mischievous spark in his ragged, aging voice, gentle and reserved as it frequently is.</p><p>Thing is, he still spends most of the time on <em>Scratch Conquered </em><span></span>blue-skying from phrase to phrase in odd moments of free-association-- which isn't bad in and of itself, except when he loses the plot and kind of half-asses it, which is often. Sometimes this aimless randomness is funny, when he concludes ""Yee Ha Ha Ha"" with shout-outs to New York City, California, Chicago, Wisconsin (!) and ""Texas Town""-- which he then appends with a softly-mumbled ""George Bush"", to the accompaniment of cowboy-movie gunshots. Too bad he repeats that same travelogue almost verbatim (sans W. shoutout) in ""Once There's a Will There's a Way"". He also tends to ruminate on the same brief snatches of phraseology about banks, money, politicians, and assorted ""sinful fuckers,"" invoking them over and over without making much of it really cohere past the three-word soundbite level.</p>
<p>And if you consider that just Scratch being Scratch-- well, he's being Scratch over some pretty ordinary reggae. Producer John Saxon is stingy with the dub signifiers, and with the exception of the knife-sharpening, melting-synthesizer rhythm on ""Jealousy"" and the otherworldly skank to ""Scratch Is Alive"", there's little sign of the percussive experimentation, thick slabs of bass, or echo-chamber deepness one would hope for from a Lee ""Scratch"" Perry record. It's not really <em>bad, </em>per se, as far as roots-revival reggae goes; it's at least tightly arranged and boasts a good horn section, which would make it a fine record for someone like Jimmy Cliff to sing over. And despite a couple of gratuitous famous-peer-driven genre experiments thrown in-- George Clinton joining in for the spaceman-summit funk jam ""Headz Gonna Roll"", Keith Richards adding some late-period Stones guitar entropy to ""Heavy Voodoo"" and ""Once There's a Will There's a Way""-- none of these collaborations really feel as momentous as they should. Without the important musical half of Perry's bizarre genius, the one that proved there was plenty of creativity behind his peculiarity, <em>Scratch Conquered </em>is a hollow experience where most of the enjoyment depends on how much you like the idea of one of popular music's strongest visionaries reduced to a novelty act just dicking around.</p></div>"|12433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12433-scratch-came-scratch-saw-scratch-conquered/|4.6|Nate Patrin

It was a richly deserved arrival that retained the spirit of their music with new beats and sounds incorporated by global pop star Manu Chao and his co-producers Marc-Antoine Moreau and Lauren Jais. On <em>Welcome to Mali</em>, Moreau and Jais stick around to steer the duo toward a harder, more outright pop approach.<br/><br/>Damon Albarn also drops in to produce the opening track and first single ""Sabali"", one of the best things he's been involved in this decade. The song opens in overtly nostalgic territory, with Mariam Doumbia's resigned opening lines run through a light filter, but it soon jumps into a different realm, with her falsetto sweeping over mournful keyboards. It's not every day you hear an African record that uses ELO as a touchstone, but this song does it to devastating emotional effect.<br/><br/>That opening shot is part of an eclectic landscape that at times sounds West African and at others sounds completely divorced from geography. <em>Dimanche √† Bamako</em>, which means ""Sunday in Bamako"", Mali's capital, felt like a product of that city. <em>Welcome to Mali</em>, however, seems a strange title for a record that sounds so global. The dramatic string arrangement on the English-language ""I Follow You"" is distinctly European, while Canadian/Somali rapper K'Naan's shout-out to the ""original West Coast-East Coast collaboration"" could either refer to Africa's East and West Coasts or to Africa's West Coast and America's East Coast-- the two ends of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.<br/><br/>Sequencing is important, too-- the Western strings of ""I Follow You"" come on the heels of the solo-bowed instrument that lends a place-less feel to ""Bozos"". Amadou's guitar is a little less prominent on this record than the last, but close listening reveals impressive stylistic dexterity as he moves from simple strumming to fluid melodic playing to staccato rhythmic patterns inspired by the Malian ngoni, a cousin of the guitar.<br/><br/>Somewhat improbably, Amadou &amp; Mariam have become a musical laboratory where the two principle players, the blind couple from Mali, are willing to try nearly anything. Ivorian reggae star Tiken Jah Fakoli drops in on one track and it feels completely natural. Pianos aren't common in Africa because the weather makes it tough to keep them in tune, but there's piano all over this album, and it sounds great rubbing up against koras (17-string West African harp) and balafons (West African marimba). On the title track, Amadou's guitar accents the chorus with big, bent surf chords, and it sounds not only logical but inevitable.<br/><br/>""Inevitable"" is a pretty good word for the stardom of Amadou &amp; Mariam. People this amazingly talented and open to new sounds and ideas rarely remain obscure, especially after so many years honing their craft and building their catalog. On further examination, in fact, <em>Welcome to Mali</em> might not be such a strange title after all. This album is an affirmation of global connectivity and an emerging global culture that transcends and repurposes tradition as it sees fit-- the sound of Mali merging with the world at large.</p></div>"|12435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12435-welcome-to-mali/|8.4|Joe Tangari

Then there's the one about not changing your last names so they're all the same as the band's, unless you're the Ramones (or arguably the Pastels). Referring to yourselves in a language not spoken in your country of origin? Another bad idea. Welsh boy/girl septet Los Campesinos! proved themselves an exception to all those rules this spring with <em>Hold on Now, Youngster...</em>, a debut album that encapsulated the best of three decades of indie's participatory culture.<br/><br/>There's no rule yet about not releasing a follow-up to your debut album in the same year, mostly because few bands have had the audacity to try it. Los Campesinos! are hedging their bets: they have yet to refer to <em>We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed</em> as their ""second album,"" even when they announced it would come in a limited pressing with a DVD documentary, poster, and 30-page zine (including contributions from members of Xiu Xiu, Grandaddy, Tender Forever, Menomena, Parenthetical Girls, and the Beautiful South). There will be no singles (and to these ears, there are none), and some online retailers have taken to listing the 10-track, 32-minute release as a ""mini-album."" Forget the technicalities and call it what it is: a messy, glorious, and cohesive artistic document of internet caf√©-era indie life that sounds best when sung by heart.</p><p>Recorded in Seattle with John Goodmanson (Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, Wu-Tang Clan), <em>We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed</em> is a fittingly noisy release from a band who recently spent time on the ""Shred Yr Face"" tour with No Age and Times New Viking. The seismic instrumental ""Between an Erupting Earth and an Exploding Sky"" is reminiscent of a Swell Maps soundscape, and leads directly into the motorik-locked melancholia of ""You'll Need Those Fingers for Crossing"". Standout ""Heart Swells/Pacific Daylight Time"" is a lovelorn miniature epic, with gusting guitars and Parenthetical Girls-quoting lo-fi vocals which shift midway through to folky strums and scratchy, indecipherable mumbling. If you mistakenly dismissed the band as another set of childish twee-poppers, our special today is crow.<br/><br/>Los Campesinos! haven't changed drastically, though. Their self-loathing, anti-romantic bitterness, and LiveJournal detail have only intensified. Several songs sound like scuffed-up, feedback-streaked versions of the first record's shouty, strings- and glockenspiel-touched punk-pop, only the despair is now less deceptively perky, and more, um, desperate. Crashing opener ""Ways to Make It Through the Wall"" resigns itself to hopelessness, death, and the inevitability of becoming like our parents, even as it wonders ""how you break the rules that you yourself imposed."" Bleaker still, ""The End of the Asterisk"" rages of another person's self-deprecation, ""It's spot on, and I'm better.""<br/><br/>The precocious youngsters of the debut have become increasingly like the prematurely old man of Weezer's classic <em>Pinkerton</em>. Vomit is a recurring theme, on the cathartic title track and on ""Miserabilia"", which describes kneeling at urinals and imagines an ex masturbating. From 4 a.m. drunk dialing, ""It's Never That Easy Though, Is It? (Song for the Other Kurt)"" goes on to contemplate which is worse: ""To see my ex-girlfriend/ Who by the way, I'm still in love with/ Sucking the face of some pretty boy""? Or to watch it happen ""with my favorite band's most popular song in the background""? The finale, ""All Your Kayfabe Friends"", screeches to a halt after a fateful closing line: ""I love the look of lust between your thighs.""<br/><br/>Los Campesinos! know their history; they may be doomed, but not just to repeat it. <em>We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed</em>'s ragged sound and distinctive packaging, like the band's propensity for non-album 7""s, hearken back to previous decades, but they're also an attempt to develop a new underground community in the here and now. ""We want this to feel like a proper event, the sort of thing that you're going to be hyped about going to see for days or weeks before, and the sort of thing that when you leave will stick long in your memory, and that you'll be happy to have been a part of,"" co-lead singer Gareth Campesinos! says ramblingly of the Shred Yr Face tour, addressing us-- as rappers often do but indie rockers so far usually haven't-- via YouTube. ""It is, undoubtedly, a little narcissistic,"" he adds. It ain't trickin' if you got it.</p></div>"|12424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12424-we-are-beautiful-we-are-doomed/|8.3|Marc Hogan

Most sounds that identify as ""dance music"" take bold measures to make their intentions known, but Parrish's sound-- an odd, insinuating kind of house music-- counts as more suggestive and sly, with subtle textural rubs and beats that register as ellipses more than exclamation points. Parrish's is a message that arrives by way of coded whispers and hums.</p><p>One of the byproducts of Parrish's elusiveness is that you have to work a little to hear him. This makes for a special kind of disconnect where newcomers might be left to wonder what Parrish partisans (and there are many) find to fetishize in tracks that play like little more than sketchy drafts or protracted sashays. The keys to the enterprise are patience and an abiding sense of a project at work-- a cunning, cumulative project that rewards immersion more than immediacy.</p><p>All of which makes <em>Sound Sculptures Volume 1</em> an ideal way to hear Parrish in his many moods. The 2xCD set follows a 3x12"" vinyl release with the same name from last year, but the tracklist has tripled-- which, with Parrish, almost has to mean the tally of ideas did, too. His cleverness is not always readily apparent. The opening ""All Yours/Who Told Adam?"" does nothing more than take a section of flanged synthesizer and a defiantly crude beat and then reiterate it over and over. The result, however, sounds somehow both heavy-handed and magisterially finessed. ""Black Music (I Love You)"" follows with a dizzy disco spell supporting a spoken-word tribute to Parrish's implied lineage (Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Gil Scott-Heron, etc.) The result this time, as Parrish tweaks the EQ levels in a manner he's made his own, sounds somehow both supremely hot and cold-- like a long sustained freezer burn.</p>
<p>Parrish rarely lays off the EQ, and his tracks are all the better for it. The smallest adjustments of sound-- upticks of treble on the drums, changes of emphasis on a vocal, the accentuation and/or subtraction of pretty much everything in play at any given moment-- make what might sound like the simplest tracks spellbinding over time. And they lend <em>Sound Sculptures</em> a casual, easygoing sense of something always happening, as in ""They Say"", a sensuous soul song (with cooed vocals by MonicaBlaire) that sounds like IDM but way less mannered-- like Aphex Twin made by back-porch means. Or ""Love Triumphant"", a nearly 12-minute spell of flute-strewn disco with a simmering rhythm that makes nodding along less an option than an order.</p>
<p>Disc 2 starts off with another long song, ""Goin' Downstairs/Music?"", that lays bare all of Parrish's charms: hypnotic snap beats, sweaty organ chords, flashing tambourine, moody bass, vocals that seem to be saying something important in a mist of murmurs and sighs. ""The Rink"" amps up the energy to rollerskating speed (with a sample of Marvin Gaye) and ""Synthetic Flemm"" (made with fellow Detroit weird-house hero Omar-S) enlists an aggressive acid line. But even at his most immediate, Parrish is graced by a sense of withholding that proves all the more generous and expressive over time.</p></div>"|12425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12425-sound-sculptures-volume-1/|8.6|Andy Battaglia

That in itself speaks to some fundamental lameness, like if Jay-Z had a rapping younger brother who called himself Zee-J. More to the point, his familial connection to a great dead producer appears to be Illa's chief qualification to release an album. On the interlude ""Alien Family"", Dilla associate Frank Nitty tries to make a case for this particular feat of nepotism, testifying as to the musical abilities of the entire Yancey clan: ""It's like they the Jackson 5 from Mars."" If you say so, Frank Nitty.<br/><br/>And yet <em>Yancey Boys</em> does work pretty well because of that familial connection: Illa exclusively works with previosuly unheard mid-1990s Dilla beats, and a new album full of old Dilla beats is never a bad thing. Dilla apparently left behind a Tupac-level archive of unused material when he died in 2006, and <em>Yancey Boys</em> is pretty much 48 minutes' worth of the producer's trademark glimmering murk. It's a good little, unhurried, rainy-afternoon rap album. Dilla had a definite formula-- amniotic soups of echoed-out Fender Rhodes, sharp snares, gurgley bass, precisely sloppy record-scratches-- yet surprises do pop up every once in a while on <em>Yancey Boys</em>. ""We Here"" swipes the drums from Kraftwerk's ""Trans-Europe Express"". ""All Good"" employs someone running a stick up and down one of those wooden crocodile sculptures. Mostly, though, these old beats just thump away in a comforting sort of fog.<br/><br/>As for Illa, he's got a rapping voice way more soft and delicate than the vaguely clumsy tough-guy yammer Dilla himself usually used. At times, Illa recalls a seriously stoned and vaguely bored Q-Tip. His lyrics are heavy on digression. On ""Strugglin'"", apropos of nothing: ""My favorite White Stripes album is <em>Elephant</em>/ OK, I know that's irrelevant/ But that's my shit."" ""IllaSoul"" is a weird sort of a come-on song, Illa getting stoned and staring at the ocean while at the same time hitting on some girl. Actual lyric: ""I'm so glad that we got we/ And also, I'm so glad that we got weed.""<br/><br/>But Illa spends at least as much time singing in a relaxed soul-singer falsetto coo as he does rapping-- and he rarely diverts attention from the beats, which makes him a more appropriate vessel for them than a prominent Dilla collaborator like Common or Busta Rhymes would've been. Illa recalls fellow indie-rap psych-traveller Aloe Blacc in the way he mixes Sam Cooke harmonies with utilitarian rapper. But unlike Aloe, Illa rarely gives the impression that he's doing anything more than fucking around in the studio. This, after all, the sort of album where someone says, ""I grab your derriere and vibrateth my fingertips"" in a vampire accent over ""F√ºr Elise"". At the end of ""Sounds Like Love"", Illa ad-libs, almost to himself, ""It's just the music. It speaks for himself."" He's right. And thanks to his brother's beyond-the-grave contributions, he himself is the most disposable part of his own debut album. Luckily for him, it probably won't be too hard to find another hour's worth of unused Dilla tracks when it comes time to record the follow-up.</p></div>"|12438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12438-yancey-boys/|6.3|Tom Breihan

In the annals of pop music history, Magazine were something of an exception, seeing how they matched the Buzzcocks in many ways while still spiraling off on several new tangents. If the Buzzcocks were a melodically inclined punk band that helped transition punk to new wave, Magazine were a new wave band that retained the fury and edginess of punk. The difference may have ultimately boiled down to the use of synthesizers, but still, Magazine posed much darker stuff than the Buzzcocks, and differently, too. As spin-offs go, Magazine were no mere copycats. They were something else entirely.</p><p>Howard Devoto was only in the Buzzcocks for a few months before ceding control to Pete Shelley. And, burning hot and bright, Magazine itself lasted only a few years. What they released, though, comprises one of the most distinctive catalogs in new wave, ranging from ""Shot by Both Sides"", the defining outburst of alienation, to more refined takes on the same subject like ""A Song From Under the Floorboards"", the last of Magazine's songs to feature founding guitarist John McGeoch before he jumped ship to Siouxsie and the Banshees.</p><p>That line-up switch is pivotal to Magazine's <em>Play</em>, a 1980 live album recorded in Australia and featuring McGeoch's freshly tapped (and short-lived) replacement Robin Simon. Most bands wouldn't have dared press ""record"" with the new guy barely installed, but clearly Magazine knew what they were doing. While hardly epic, the disc bristles with intensity and arty, angular grit. In fact, for a while, <em>Play</em> might have been the best introduction to the band, as it showcases several of the group's best attributes-- Devoto's acidic singing, the disorienting keyboards, and future Bad Seed Barry Adamson's pulsing bass.</p>
<p>That's not really the case anymore, since the band's four studio albums are widely available in remastered editions and Magazine's discography has been distilled down to the pretty solid best-of <em>Where the Power Is</em>. For more enthusiastic listeners, there's also the 3xCD companion <em>Maybe It's Right to Be Nervous Now</em>, which featured several of the group's most familiar songs, either live or in alternate form. And finally, there's the small matter that <em>Play</em> lacks the trademark ""Shot by Both Sides"".</p>
<p>Yet it's still substantial. Magazine were plenty muscular and, for a new wave act, not afraid to drop the sheen in favor of something less polished. Not that the likes of ""Definitive Gaze"" or ""The Light Pours Out of Me"" were ever particularly polished, but <em>Play</em> does show off the more feral side of the band, even when toning down the guitars on ""A Song From Under the Floorboards"" or deconstructing Sly Stone's ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)"". It's for fans only at this point, but arriving just in time for next year's reunion, <em>Play</em> is a welcome reminder of the band's prowess.</p></div>"|12429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12429-play/|6.8|Joshua Klein

Yet none of us harbored any delusions that our love-- or the 9.3 rating from this site-- was ever going to make the record popular: The sound of his music is pretty evidently Not for Everyone, and that's precisely where the love comes from.<br/><br/>Painstakingly assembled by a Londoner named Ben Jacobs, the music of Max Tundra is strikingly unique, documenting a whole other realm of pop music that seems to exist mostly inside one guy's head. There are recognizable things within it: streaks of quaint English pop and soul, oddball programming of video-game synth sounds, a keyboard sensibility that ranges from lite funk to a kind of gleeful prog-rock musical theater, and a happy calm that vaguely recalls Vince Guaraldi's <em>Peanuts</em> music. It's tempting to describe it all using some outlandish metaphor: I imagine a reality show where XTC, Prince, Aphex Twin, and George Gershwin have to live together inside the sound chip of an aging Game Boy. But that makes Max Tundra sound cartoonish and scattershot, when the surprise of this stuff is how much it can all feel beautiful, simple, and coherent.</p><p>Now, after six years spent programming on archaic Amiga music software, Max Tundra gives us the follow-up, <em>Parallax Error Beheads You</em>. At first listen, this set of pop songs may seem more cluttered and frantic than its predecessor; much like the string of remixes Jacobs has done in the meantime, the music here is peppier and more tightly wound, and more melodically serpentine than ever. Give it a few listens, though, and you begin to feel like someone is sneaking in while you sleep and removing twists and turns from the songs, or straightening out the rhythms.<br/><br/>The old line about literature is that a good book teaches you how to read it; in this case, a record might be teaching you how to listen to it. What starts out tricky and overwhelming quickly organizes itself in your head and becomes a joy to follow, to the point where you can delight in all the detail Jacobs packs in: The way he lets harmonies unravel and then step neatly back into focus, or how he executes chord changes by shifting the whole song down a few steps, like someone putting a thumb on a spinning record. What programmer spends six years on 10 songs without making sure every one of those details works?<br/><br/>A good starting point is the record's least tricky song, ""The Entertainment"", a quaint and sunny piece that sounds something like trance music for children. Another is the track that's bound to be the album's great takeaway, ""Which Song"", with its pop-soul vocals and creamy synthesizers. The 10-minute closer, ""Until We Die"", sounds like Tundra's answer to side two of Abbey Road, but the one I can't stop playing is ""Number Our Days"", which plays out like some kind of amateur musical about the afterlife, with sinister synth-funk verses and angelic strumming through the choruses.<br/><br/>For those who've been following Jacobs, the big news on this record is entirely personal. On his last album, he explained the way his lyrics work (""I only sing about things that happen to me"") and talked rather a lot about having stolen someone's girlfriend, which neatly explained the title of his debut (<em>Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be</em>). Not long into the first track here, a bouncy pastoral piece called ""Gum Chimes"", we get an update: Jacobs and the girlfriend in question have split up. Many of the lyrics that follow are, simply put, a lonely geek's lament-- the frustrations of a guy who's always distracted by a ""future wife,"" yet can't find a girl to bring home to the family. I really can't tell whether this is wonderfully human, slightly embarrassing, or just honest, but my sense of who Jacobs is has jumped way, way forward with this record.<br/><br/>Thinking back on his last conversation with that girlfriend, Jacobs sings, ""a pint of chicken soup came falling from my eyes."" The fact that he's now actually <a href=""/article/news/146374-max-tundra-bundles-lp-download-with-soup""><strong>selling cans of his own homemade chicken soup</strong></a> is mostly a joke, but it's also a metaphor; if this joyfully hyperactive record is what comes of his troubles, we're all the luckier. It's packed with ideas, some of which work beautifully and some of which are just a joy to hear play out, but most of all, it's still a whole other world of pop music-- an absolutely unique, enchanting, and irreplaceable vision of how the stuff can work.</p></div>"|12426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12426-parallax-error-beheads-you/|8.5|Nitsuh Abebe

For all the cosmic wonder he can evoke by placing electronics against naturalistic backdrops, Hebden has often gotten himsef stuck in ruts, even if just for a few moments here and there. In part, that's the fate of an improviser, but it's exacerbated by samplers and machines that can be slow to respond to Hebden's shifts, however smartly they're triggered. In improvised music, it's one thing to sound like you're in transition and another thing to actually be in transition.¬† <br/><br/>None of that mattered on <em>Ringer</em>, thanks in part to techno's formalist grounding. But it matters a lot on <em>NYC</em>, the fourth album made by Hebden and jazz drummer Steve Reid. <em>Ringer's</em> functional dance-music accepts, even privileges, the kind of ruts that have tripped up Hebden in the past; <em>NYC</em>, meanwhile, puts them to work in settings that serve different purposes. On the duo's earlier albums, Hebden and Reid occasionally sounded like they were only barely aware of what the other was doing or might stand to do next. On <em>NYC</em>, they sound much more conscious and sympathetic.¬†¬† <br/><br/>""Lyman Place"" starts the album with an unvarying few-note bass-line set against the sound of a jet engine rising in long, slow takes. It sounds like something Miles Davis would have done in the 1970s, and Hebden's relative understatedness helps set off Reid's drumming-- circular, splashy, coyly shrouded by the shimmer of persistent cymbals. ""1st &amp; 1st"" follows with a fit of funk built around a guitar sample that Hebden makes sound twitchy, like a signal from a world away.<br/><br/>It sounds as if Hebden made a strategic decision to do less on this album, which heightens the impact when he does make a move. Reid benefits greatly from the space to breathe-- much of his drumming on the duo's other records sounds comparatively crowded and confused by how to connect with Hebden. And Hebden himself shows off a new sense of always being in the right place at the right time, without getting caught out in between. He hasn't lost any of the polyglot record-collector drive that has made Four Tet matter from the start: <em>NYC</em> wanders through spells informed by melodica-strewn dub, shoegaze rock, weird folk, and of course the clattering sense of purpose at work in free-jazz. But Hebden sounds considerably more easy-going now, like he's taking time to listen in to what comes out as it happens all around him.</p></div>"|12440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12440-nyc/|6.8|Andy Battaglia

Their self-released <em>Let's Talk About It</em> EP was twitchy and muddy-- it both stood out alongside the more orderly indie rock set and seemed advanced for an unsigned band. Decidedly raw, their psych-blues riffs were fun to trace as they careened into jammier territory. The Austin group went on to issue <em>Workout Holiday</em>, a full-length released only in Europe; now a re-shuffled version, <em>Exposion</em>, serves as its U.S. debut.</p><p>With the ommission of EP tracks ""Let's Talk About It"" and ""Darksided Computer Mouth"", <em>Exposion</em> isn't so easily characterized-- and the group comes off as more versatile, more than DIY <em>Nuggets</em> throwbacks. Opener ""Don't Look That Way at It"" loops a chickenscratch guitar and mashes it into a loose, sore-throated chorus. The song seems to outline their central creed: paint the neat sloppy, the tight loose, the drunk totally in control, and force nothing. With guitar noodling galore, much of <em>Exposion</em> accentuates those aims. The more straightforward ""Shake Shake Shake"" and ""Transparency"" are fully realized rockers that unravel and work out their psychedelic tangles in eventually thoughtful closing arguments. On the flip side, the breezy electric folk of ""Heart From Us All"" builds and fills before spilling into a beautiful vocal turn by frontguy James Petralli.<br/><br/>""Shake Shake Shake"" in particular showcases bassist Steve Terebecki's gift for putting songs on his back. Alongside drummer Josh Block's polyrhythmic supernovas, the two form a timekeeping section that can maul and tickle almost simultaneously, depending on the tenor of Petralli's shouts and croon. ""You Can't Say"" is a refreshingly focused and tender-footed shoegazer that puts his pipes on ice. It's a standout moment that provides a much more satisfying breather than instrumental ""Migration Wind"", a punchy jazz number that threatens to jump the tracks. Then again, a band this chaotic and unpredictable probably designed those tracks to twist and turn that way in the first place.</p></div>"|12437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12437-exposion/|7.8|David Bevan

Music plays a similarly large role in <em>Hallam Foe</em>, the Scottish coming of age tale (renamed ""Mister Foe"" for no good reason in the States) starring Jamie Bell as the titular anti-hero, a troubled teen voyeur with major mother issues set loose in the country's capitol of Edinburgh to find himself and work through his various problems.</p><p>The mind of Bell's Foe is full of conspiracy theories and obsessions, with stalking and spying his primary coping mechanisms. Needless to say, much of the twisted film features Bell wordlessly observing the world, which leaves plenty of room for music to fill the gaps. Certainly director David Mackenzie designed the film that way, considering the consistently strong use of music-- and especially music from Scottish acts-- in his movies. <em>The Last Great Wilderness</em>, for example, enlisted the Pastels. <em>Young Adam</em> featured a score by David Byrne (lest one forget, a green-card-carrying Scot in American clothing). And for <em>Hallam Foe</em>, Mackenzie worked with Domino to license a number of Scottish bands for the film's soundtrack, including Franz Ferdinand, James Yorkston, U.N.P.O.C., Sons and Daughters, King Creosote, and Orange Juice.</p><p>It's Orange Juice's ""Blue Boy"" that kicks off both film and soundtrack, and it's also the last bit of prominent vocal we get in the film itself until around the halfway point, when the instrumental teases give way for a brief taste of (non Scot) Clinic's ""If You Could Read Your Mind."" U.N.P.O.C.'s ""Here on My Own"" is enlisted for a brief montage (just as it was for the film's trailer), but it's nice to hear the full version here from the obscure band. Much of the rest of  <em>Hallam Foe</em>, film and soundtrack alike, features snippets of wistful or folky tracks courtesy of artists like Yorkston and Woodbine, with the occasional digression by, for example, Junior Boys (""Double Shadow"" is used in a bar scene).</p>
<p>Presumably due to licensing issues, two of the Scottish acts arguably best suited to Mackenzie's quietly intriguing and tonally introspective tale, Belle and Sebastian and Boards of Canada, are nowhere to be found. The former would have been the perfect fit for Mackenzie's movie, certainly more so than they were for Todd Solondz's <em>Storytelling</em>. And Boards of Canada are downright cinematic to begin with, though their enigmatic amorphousness is approached by the presence of Argentina's Juana Molina, whose loopy folktronica ""Salvese Quien Pueda"" at least feels right for the film.</p>
<p>However, stepping up with unlikely mastery of mood rather than manic energy comes everyone's favorite chart-topping Scots Franz Ferdinand, whose somewhat literal-minded ""Hallam Foe Dandelion Blow"" falls closer to the ghostly psych of, say, the Coral than the group's usual m√©tier. Listening to FF stretch their boundaries a bit makes you wonder what the disc (and movie) would have been like overseen by a single artist, as B&amp;S did with the aforementioned <em>Storytelling</em> or Badly Drawn Boy did wonderfully with <em>About a Boy</em>. Even if it captures the film's oddball sensibilities as is, the <em>Hallam Foe</em> set is slightly more sampler than soundtrack and certainly less effective separated from the scenes with which Mackenzie paired them. After all, in the end it's a movie about looking, not listening, and these songs don't always resonate outside their designated context.</p></div>"|12432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12432-hallam-foe-ost/|6.3|Joshua Klein

Though it doesn't look it thanks to a broad, impressive list of releases from this and last year-- led by, in no specific order, Bun B's crowd-pleasing <em>II Trill</em>, Trae's wrenching <em>Life Goes On</em>, Devin the Dude's uncanny <em>Waiting to Inhale</em> and Scarface's lion-in-winter <em>MADE</em>-- even Houston's once evergreen Rap-A-Lot records is a house going to seed. Trae left the label in May. Devin has fled too, and already dropped a new full-length disc-- with Razor &amp; Tie of all places.</p><p>For Z-Ro, who first appeared in the corners of DJ Screw's chain of drizzling, endless mid-1990s classics (most of which are now conveniently repackaged and available at your nearest Best Buy-- start with the 3xCD <em>June 27</em>), and has released five albums already on Rap-A-Lot, the whole world is starting to sound like it's closing up shop. Case in point is Z-Ro's sixth on Rap-A-Lot, <em>Crack</em>, which is drab, shabby and more than a little lonely (""I smoke purple stuff alone in my room""). It can't make its terrain of solipsistic gangsters and Houston beltway-sulk hum with emotion or its layers of horns and hi-hats shake with any color.</p><p>Z-Ro produces eight of the album's 15 tracks, and leans on heaps of previous compositions. The raided discs include the last two Trae albums and Trae and Z-Ro's two collaborations, 2003's <em>A.B.N (Assholes by Nature)</em> and this summer's downpour of noir, <em>It Is What It Is</em>. The samples are all tamped down and strip-mined in their reincarnations on <em>Crack</em>. ""Here We Go"" features an inexplicable pan flute and a lifeless snare. The would-be ladies-jam ""Baby Girl"" reeks with clumps of digital sparkle and hubby-talk: ""She follow my lead/ And respect the fact that I wear the pants.""</p>
<p>Z-Ro's hook is that the intimacy in his raps-- perpetually commemorating a handful of dead collaborators and friends, worshiping solitude and seemingly dismissing all worldly pleasures (except, of course, kush, candy paint, and lean)-- dips into weakness. On <em>Crack</em> he scoffs at dancing on ""If That's How You Feel"": ""My body don't move like that, so Im'a chill/ Im'a play the wall, leaving all to dancing to y'all."" He'd prefer it if no one called and no one spoke; four wheels are typically all the company he needs.</p>
<p>But for all his confession Z-Ro brushes his breakthroughs aside. As soon has he resonates with real sentiment-- on divorce: ""I don't give a fuck as long as my child knows me""-- the album swoops back into dropsied howls about those suspicious club hos and these disrespectful young corner boys. Where, say, Scarface, may hold a mournful note for an extra beat, Z-Ro instantly flips into a stream of pithy taunts and complaints. The effect is dulling, frustrating, and more than a little repulsive.</p>
<p>Z-Ro at least had his strengths catered to on 2005's <em>Let the Truth Be Told</em>. There, the underrated long-time Scarface producer Mike Dean laid out a chain of warmer, blues-inflected guitar and drum loops for Z-Ro's moans. Dean is totally absent from <em>Crack</em> and other veteran Houston producers like Mr. Lee can't summon any suitable nostalgia, which makes Z-Ro seem even more alone. All the shining lights of the Houston scene sport something ineffable: Scarface's transcendent violence; Devin's beat-poet-leer; Trae's whorls of emotional concision; Big Moe's druggy, violet sunshine. Z-Ro has always been satisfied playing the brassy, noncommittal grump. That's a fine enough role to play, but as the world around him downsizes and constricts, he's clamming up, retreating home and phoning it in.</p></div>"|12430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12430-crack/|4.7|Evan McGarvey

But they also indicate that Danielson Famile's quirkiness and religious convictions aren't something to ""get past,"" and that, most of all,<em> Ships</em> didn't succeed because it marked out new territory but because of steady improvement in the group's craft.</p><p><em>Trying Hartz</em> would have been better served and more useful coming right on the heels of <em>Ships</em>, when curiousity over the band's back catalog was probably at its peak. By this point, curious <em>Ships</em> listeners have likely pillaged Danielson's discography; for those who always knew about the gems lurking on the group's previous LPs, it's hard to imagine the eight live tracks here are a proper substitute for either the originals or one's fond memories of Danielson's communal live sing-alongs.<br/> <br/> My own first experience with the Danielson Famile actually was a road trip along with their 2001 LP, <em>Fetch the Compass Kids</em>. Luckily that album, their best pre-<em>Ships</em>, is well represented, though many of my other favorites from the Danielson discography are absent (""We Don't Say Shut Up"", ""Things Against Stuff"", ""Gorgeous New Age"", ""Flesh Thang""). The only new tracks are a pair of six-second bookends, ""Now Try"" and closer ""Cheer Hart"". The older tracks are bursting with two- or three-note organ and keyboard lines, quick rhythms, and halting breaks.</p><p>Their best songs remind you that they're a family--<em> Tri-Danielson!!! Alpha</em>'s ""Rubbernecker"" and <em>Fetch the Compass Kids</em>' ""Good News for the Pus Pickers"" even feature shout-outs highlighting a Danielson member or their instrument-- and the live tracks remind the audience they're part of that family as well. On ""Don't You Be the Judge"", Smith asks the crowd to think of their own verses to the song. ""I'm gonna call on ya, so you'd better be ready!"" he warns. He had to take the first one himself, but, after the demonstration, audience members volunteer to do the next four. <br/> <br/> Most of the tracks are about effort, about making small adjustments toward self-improvement and understanding others. These can be either funny or serious. ""Rallying the Dominoes"" warns against getting too caught up in your own projects; ""Daughters Will Tune You"" deals with that specific relationship. But there's plenty of humor, too: ""Idiot Boksen"" is about watching too much TV; and Smith sings ""Won't kiss no pottymouth/ Away with pottymouth"" toward the end of half-spoken-word oddity ""Pottymouth"". Outlier ""Pottymouth"" aside, the rest of their idiosyncratic sounds seems normal to me-- but I've been a fan for almost a decade. This collection isn't for fans, but for those who haven't dug deeper than <em>Ships</em>, or for those wrongly convinced <em>Ships</em> was a blip in an otherwise dense and unrewarding discography.</p></div>"|12436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12436-trying-hartz/|8.0|Jessica Suarez

The head of German label Cadenza may not have initiated the genre's trend away from minimalism and back towards deep house classicism, but he made it exciting. In the process, he practically trademarked many of the year's key tracks. Luciano switched easily from brain-frying hypnotism to body-moving funk, blurring distinctions between the two. Unfortunately, his official 2008 DJ mix, <em>Fabric4</em>1, veers too much toward the former, restricting access to the ""ultimate Luciano live experience"" to those who download bootlegged live sets.<br/><br/>As if on cue, Michigan-based DJ/producer Matthew Dear steps up to the plate with <em>Body Language Vol. 7</em>, a mix for Berlin's Get Physical label that apes the Chilean DJ's minimal European techno and deep U.S. house-- a circuitous route sure to annoy purists of all stripes. Dear's the right kind of artist to jump on this trend: From the quirky micro-pop records he releases under his own name to the coldly monolithic bangers he concocts under his Audion alias, he has a knack for taking other people's blueprints to their logical conclusions.<br/><br/>Dear fares best when pushing to the extremes of the styles he spins here. In the minimal camp, Kalabrese's ""Cityblues"" is a murky cabaret number with its insistent bass pulse, Chic guitar, and erratic, live-sounding percussion, is as compelling as any of the house-noir that Kompakt's Matias Aguayo has made of late; Radio Slave's remix of Mlle Caro and Franck Garcia's ""Dead Souls"" counterposes eerie, fragile vocals with longform groove; DJ Koze's ""Zou Zou"" is the most imaginative adoption of world music this side of trumpeter Jon Hassell or Chilean minimal house producer Ricardo Villalobos. At the other end, the casual, celebratory vibe of Kid Sublime's delightfully glittery disco revival ""Basement Works Vol. 1"" evokes the best impromptu house party ever. And the set closes with Lorenzo's already classic 2001 anthem ""Get Deep"", its seductive bass punctuated with thick handclaps and yearning male vocals. <br/><br/>Sometimes, though, the middle ground is also the highest ground: The set's best track is Seth Troxler and Patrick Russell's ""Doctor of Romance"", an endlessly involving groove concealing gently writhing layers of percussion and an army of murmured vocals, sighs, and grunts. The tribal workout of Basti Grub's ""Baaa Niii"" is nearly as strong, with its surround sound rhythms and slurred spoken-word vocals. An entire album of tracks like these would be irresistible rather than simply great. <br/><br/>That Dear falls slightly short of this is less a measure of his own successes and shortcomings than those of the 2008 minimal scene. The triumph of deep house, which has replaced minimal as today's archetypal sound, has reinvigorated dance music values such as restraint, subtlety, and that most meaningless of words, ""deepness."" Minimal, on the other hand, placed a classicist-baiting emphasis on novelty, diversity, and melodrama. Lately, minimalism has departed from such values and lurched towards sameness, becoming a drab clich√©. This year's ascendancy of rigorously reductive (but not minimal) deep house turns that pursuit of sameness into the norm, as producers craft undemonstrative, compulsive grooves.<br/><br/>Subtlety and restraint can be great things in dance music, and many of the best dance tracks of the year are those that get this ""undemonstrative, compulsive"" mix just right; the trouble is that distinguishing between the scintillating and the boring becomes a challenge when these traits dominate. There are few truly awful records, yet far too many just-decent ones, and navigating the tiny stylistic space between them is increasingly difficult. In such conditions, Dear gets it right more often than most-- a good two-thirds of <em>Body Language Vol. 7</em> is genuinely compelling-- but I can't shake the feeling he won this round by a throw of the dice.</p></div>"|12422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12422-body-language-vol-7/|7.0|Tim Finney

Christopher Moll and Jonathan Wilkins, both previously of a Stereolab-leaning outfit called See Venus, crafted lavish, loungey arrangements that merged bossa nova, John Barry film scores, Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, and vintage French pop within direct, pure-pop songcraft enamored of romance and rainy days. Tel Aviv-born singer Tim Yehezkely's shy whisper was a perfect final ingredient, evoking twee-poppers like the Softies or Camera Obscura as well as the seductive sophisti-pop of Unfiltered label chiefs Ivy.</p><p>The Postmarks' second full-length actually <em>is</em> a covers album-- and a fine one, at that. <em>By-the-Numbers </em>follows the band's beguiling online-only recordings of Astrud Gilberto's swoonsome love song ""Dreamer"" and, more adventurously, Ministry's ""Everyday Is Halloween"". The project began as a monthly series of cover songs to be posted on eMusic, but by September the group had realized they had enough material for another proper album instead. There's one (yes, slightly precious) organizing principle: Each of the songs has a number in its title, counting up from 1 to 11, until the finale, the counting-to-12 ""Pinball Number Drop"" originally sung by the Pointer Sisters for ""Sesame Street"".</p><p>Even if you didn't pay any attention to the song titles, <em>By-the-Numbers</em> would still be a collection of good-to-great songs performed in the swoonsome style the Postmarks made their signature on their first record. Yehezkely's understatement suits the less-is-more theme of ""One Note Samba""; based on Antoni Carlos Jobim's version, the cover is a natural fit for the Postmarks' already Brazilian-tinged sound. Yehezkely's softness also settles nicely into the whirling strings of the more stridently Nancy Sinatra-sung Bond theme ""You Only Live Twice"" (familiar to those of us of a certain age and radio-listening habits as sampled in Robbie Williams' dire Y2K cash-in ""Millennium""). These slippers were made for walking to bed.</p>
<p>When the Postmarks have to stretch more to make the songs their own, the results are no less satisfying. Bob Marley's ""Three Little Birds"" might have stood out like a fat white guy in a rastafarian hat, but instead it's a slow-motion highlight, with gentle guitars and wide-screen percussion. Rock-style drums and shimmery guitar lines do show up to grace the Postmarks' takes on Ride's ""OX4"" and the Jesus and Mary Chain's ""Nine Million Rainy Days"", but both manage to convey the nuance within the group's style rather than deviating too much from it-- if Air could soundtrack a Sofia Coppola film, why not these cats? Blondie's ""11:59"" is a bit of a reach, but getting more upbeat doesn't hurt the Postmarks here. An Ennio Morricone-flavored remake of the Byrds' ""Eight Miles High"" is the only track that doesn't quite cohere, although David Bowie's regal croon is missed on ""Five Years"".</p>
<p>One revelation is the Ramones ""7-11"", which ends up sounding less like a deadpan punk-pop reference to girl-group classics than a sincere and all-new teenage symphony. ""Whatever happened to the radio?/ And where did all the fun songs go?"" Yehezkely murmurs, per Joey R., embodying the song's tragic ""Leader of the Pack""/""Last Kiss""-esque conclusion as if there had never been a ""Leader of the Pack"" or ""Last Kiss"". <em>By-the-Numbers</em> probably wouldn't have ever been played much on the radio in the past couple of decades, and its mood is more relaxing than fun, but it's a lovely set of covers that  sound like they could've been originals. Hey, somebody give the Postmarks another number.</p></div>"|12421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12421-by-the-numbers/|7.4|Marc Hogan

She defines herself by her quirks: Her songs, which are too dark and sexual to be labeled precious, take their convoluted metaphors a step or two too far, and her prose-poem lyrics often create verse lines with odd, sometimes amelodic meters. In general, she intimates a bohemian outlook and a self-consciousness that occasionally threatens to render her songs meta. In this regard, her debut, <em>Until Death Comes</em>, was slightly muted, as if she were unsure how to differentiate herself musically, but her follow-up, <em>Silence Is Wild</em>, sounds not only more assured in its arrangements and performances, but more lively for being so self-indulgent.<br/><br/>Hyv√∂nen has gained an appreciation for enormity and melodrama. Big choruses convey big ideas, and her lyrics can be almost defiantly sentimental. Opener ""Dirty Dancing"" begins as a reminiscence of her first crush, then leaps forward to meeting him years later, their paths having diverged so completely that memories of playacting <em>Dirty Dancing</em> together are all they have in common. Throughout the verses, Hyv√∂nen weaves in passages of ""Be My Baby"" (from that movie's soundtrack), and the paper-thin wall of sound on the outro is all the more affecting for being constructed from the materials at hand: voice, piano, and of course castanets.<br/><br/>""Enemy Within"" shares that sense of theatricality, adding a choir and an enormous chorus. Too bad its lyrics sound so meaningless: ""Stone on the bottom of the ocean says I know this is not a cul-de-sac."" The tangled metaphor of ""Highway 2 U"", in which Hyv√∂nen literally says she's not afraid to flip off the cops on the figurative road to romance, is easier to forgive, as the song's palpable sexual tension and her wordless howls make that sentiment come across as feverishly unguarded. These songs may seem elaborate, but Hyv√∂nen is only working with a handful of elements. Her small, unobtrusive band gives the ABBA-meets-Fleetwood Mac ""Scandinavian Blonde"" and the city ode ""London!"" an excited urgency, Ida Lund√©n's synths lend texture and character to a handful of tracks, and though ""Oh Shanghai"" has some gongs and percussion, it's the orchestrated exception to the rule. ¬†<br/><br/>That big-yet-basic sound is just another of Hyv√∂nen's quirks, hinting at something dark and insoluble threading through these songs. She knows she's a bit different from the rest of the world, and that self-awareness gives a song like ""My Cousin"" added impact: As strings swirl quietly around her, Hyv√∂nen realizes she and her man aren't the marrying kind (""we live outside the realms of yes and no"" is how she puts it), but wants to find her own equivalent measure of love and security. One suggests itself on ""December"", a stoic number with a melancholy piano theme that describes their trip to an abortion clinic. His mere presence, bringing her coffee and a sandwich and offering support, might be measure enough, but she says she can taste the ""last breath of our love"" in his kiss. Whether the song is strictly autobiographical is beside the point. That Hyv√∂nen sings about such matters on <em>Silence Is Wild</em> is brave enough, but that she does so with such a complicated sense of generous affection and self-preserving detachment truly sets her apart.</p></div>"|12414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12414-silence-is-wild/|7.7|Stephen M.

Dressed in exaggerated, skinny-hipster re-imaginings of old-school rappers or drag queens, Starfucker come off like a combination of Chromeo and ELO, indulging in theatrical silliness while conjuring sugary pop hooks. Onstage, the members swap multiple instruments, providing a kinetic, anything-can-happen energy. But sadly, the studio strips Starfucker of their visual appeal, rhythmic heft, and electricity, leaving wispy electro-pop songs, washed-out vocals, and skittishly edited samples in their place.<br/><br/>Their self-titled debut is a mix of primary songwriter Josh Hodges' home recordings and some after-the-fact finessing from his bandmates and label head, which helps explain why it feels flatter than the group's full-bodied stage show. The tinny percussion and slinky, reverb-laden bass are shadows of their usual selves. And the songs-- always saturated with themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and loss behind upbeat instrumentation-- simply feel boringly melancholy without the live party atmosphere.<br/><br/>Most of these songs are wrapped in a gauzy, echo-laden wash that has a distancing effect on the music, but a few lovely standouts pierce the poor production. ""German Love"" latches on to a sweet guitar melody amidst stuttering samples, layering a bright sing-along chorus over a neon keyboard line. ""Holly"" marries cheeky, deadpan lyrics (""L.A. hasn't killed me yet"") to ticking percussion, soulful guitar, and a repetitive, descending synth riff for a track that wouldn't sound out of place on Fujiya &amp; Miyagi's setlist. And ""Pop Song"" is exactly as advertised: A strutting gem that uses a funky bassline, distorted effects, and videogame synths to enhance the band's best melody. Unfortunately, too many of the songs highlight Starfucker's shortcomings, leaving them introspective, detached, and even timid. If this three-piece can learn to have as much fun in the studio as they do onstage, these fuckers might actually become stars.</p></div>"|12419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12419-starfucker/|5.0|Rebecca Raber

As Josephine Olausson illustrates on the new Love Is All album, that feeling isn't exclusive to sad-sack middle-aged bachelors; you can be the cute, charismatic frontwoman for an internationally lauded Swedish indie band and not only feel intense loneliness, but feel like everyone around you is enjoying the sight of your loneliness. In other words, <em>A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night</em> is a logical sequel to her band's 2005 debut <em>Nine Times That Same Song</em>, wherein she follows the cycle of making out and falling out by talking us through the subsequent sadness of single life. Few bands are better at conveying that sense of feeling alone in the crowd, with Olausson's inner monologues fighting to be heard over the din of her band's sax-blasted garage-disco.<br/><br/>Sonically speaking, <em>A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night</em> is a classic second album, in the tradition of the Clash's <em>Give 'Em Enough Rope</em> or the Strokes' <em>Room on Fire</em>: It may not deliver the same jolt as its predecessor, but its somewhat cleaner production highlights Love Is All's strengthened pop prowess. As predictable as that move may be, it wasn't entirely anticipated by the band's interim endeavors: Since the release of <em>Nine Times</em>, Love Is All have been eager to mess around with other peoples' songs (as heard on the tour-only <em>Covers</em> EP), or enlist other artists to mess with their own (the <em>Mixed Up</em> remix disc)-- both of which indicated a certain fatigue with their beserker-pop aesthetic. Olausson re-enforces that idea on ""Sea Sick"", the new album's most self-referential track, rehashing the theme and breakdown of the group's signature single ""Busy Doing Nothing"" while shouting, ""I'm bored to death of all this shit!""<br/>¬†<br/>But Love Is All have made progress, too, as charted in hyperactive garage-rockers like ""Movie Romance"", where Olausson's rant about bullshit big-screen depictions of love is lent a humorously self-deprecating context by the song's jittery, accelerated guitar riff; the desperation described on first single ""Wishing Well"" is likewise leavened by a zippy organ refrain lifted wholesale from the Clean's charming 1981 single ""Tally Ho!"" But even in the midst of such brazen thievery, Olausson's growth as a storyteller is undeniable. Where she once favored itemized phrases and staccato shrieks, her writing here offers richly detailed first-person vignettes that carefully straddle the line between self-absorbed and sympathetic; no doubt, the sleigh-belled disco of ""Last Choice""-- which suggests that any one-night stand is better than going home alone-- is perfectly timed for the coming season of regretful holiday-party hookups.<br/><br/>Short of turning into the Swedish indie version of ""Sex and the City"", <em>A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night</em>'s closing stretch emphasizes that the repercussions of sleeping in a perpetually empty bed are more psychological than physical, with Olaussen convincingly conveying the dangers of a mind left to wander. By the time we hit the twitchy punk rumble ""Big Bangs, Black Holes, Meteorites""-- just three of the insomnia-inducing phenomena accounted for in this album's title-- her frustration has given way to pure hypochondria and agoraphobia, while the equally manic and misanthropic closer ""19 Floors"" quantifies those anxieties in relation to her highrise living arrangement (""19 floors and a thousand doors, and one of them is mine, a million names don't seem the same""), as the song's strident anti-socialism (""I don't want to walk my neighbor's dog and I can't lend a cup of milk"") culminates in a sax-squawked flame-out. <em>A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night</em> may pick up where the band left off on <em>Nine Times That Same Song</em>, but by its conclusion, we see the band adopting a new self-defining philosophy: Hate is all.</p></div>"|12415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12415-a-hundred-things-keep-me-up-at-night/|8.1|Stuart Berman

While the Icelandic composer's <em>IBM 1401: A User</em>'<em>s Manual</em>-- a 2006 concept album about one of the earliest computers to arrive in his country-- was a distinct step down from his best work, it was a compelling narrative that fully complemented his stylistic choices: slow crescendos, voices reciting instruction manuals, and lingering digital noise. The second installment of a planned trilogy introduced by <em>IBM</em>, <em>Fordl√¢ndia</em> shifts J√≥hannsson's technological narrative to more abstract sources: Henry Ford's failed procurement of rubber in the Amazon, a Victorian priestess and the death of Pan, and lamentably misguided scientists. <br/><br/>Musically, <em>Fordl√¢ndia</em> will sound familiar to J√≥hannsson fans-- it's full of gorgeously sweeping strings aided by gently babbling electronics. If nothing in that description immediately brings to mind an automobile magnate haphazardly erecting an American-ized village for Brazilian rubber farmers, you're not alone. J√≥hannsson is accustomed to collaborating with visual artists-- he has scored more than a half-dozen film soundtracks and <em>IBM</em> was originally intended to accompany a dance performance. Standing alone, <em>Fordl√¢ndia</em>-- recorded partially with the same Prague orchestra that performed <em>IBM</em>-- compensates by being the most traditionally dramatic of J√≥hannsson's works.<br/><br/>The nearly 14-minute title track opens the album with a minute of near-silence, but from there the composer's heartstring symphony starts tugging hard. The sky-blue splendor of the major-key mix recalls, to cite a geographically obvious example, the wordless thrum of fellow Icelanders Sigur R√≥s. ""The Rocket Builder (Io Pan!)"", ostensibly about a pagan scientist from California who blows himself up, is tenser and more paranoid. Small string ripples interrupt a minor-key piano melody; electronic percussion titters in the background. <br/><br/>Elsewhere, on ""The Great God Pan Is Dead"" a muted choir sings wide syllables over an unobtrusive string accompaniment. Their utterances, shapeless at first, coalesce into the words ""Pan Is Dead"" by the track's end, lending the piece a soft mysticism. ""Chimaerica"" hovers around a lonely organ, providing both a sense of the gothic and one of <em>Fordl√¢ndia</em>'s moments of true restraint. ""How We Left Fordl√¢ndia"" returns to J√≥hansson's bread and butter, pounding out 15 minutes of spectral beauty and un-teasing melody. ""How We Left Fordl√¢ndia"" uncoils slower than either the title track or ""Fordl√¢ndia-- Aerial View"", serving as end-credits for an album on which almost every song could soundtrack a finale or a fadeout. <br/><br/>As comfortable as J√≥hannsson is working with his orchestra, <em>Fordl√¢ndia</em>'s wisest moments are its smallest: the embers of ""Chimaerica"", the swamp-reeds of the interspersed ""Melodia"" pieces. By comparison, the ""Fordl√¢ndia"" trilogy is simultaneously skillful, gorgeous, and a bit too polished-- they're a pristine composition on a record full of them, but it doesn't gel with the messy, self-destructive historical footnotes that inspired them.</p></div>"|12420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12420-fordlandia/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

Their name translates to ""Y2K bug"" or ""year 2000 problem,"" and they've been around for 10 years, making albums, zines, live CD-Rs and handmade clothes. Still, they haven't released an album stateside. <em>Neji/Tori</em>, two of their earlier EPs bundled together, at least postpones that release gap in their discography. But their biggest problem is that on record you can't get the contrast between their physical size and the size of their music. It's that contrast that struck visiting U.S. musicians like Prefuse 73, who called them both ""tiny"" and ""diminuative"" in a <em>Dazed &amp; Confused</em> interview. ""The drummer was as big as my hand,"" he said, before waxing romantic on their technical prowess. That contrast between size and sound is probably startling, but size doesn't matter much overseas. They may be dainty when compared to their U.S. counterparts, but their proper context is within Japan's lush experimental scene, from Koenjihyakkei to Boredoms and Merzbow, where women can be responsible for the harshest sounds.</p><p>The two EPs here were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively. <em>Tori</em>'s titles are in Japanese, but <em>Neji</em>'s songs are named for their influences. ""Sonic Youth"" is aptly named, as bassist Yuri Zaikawa slows her nimble runs to approximate Kim Gordon's sturdy, deliberate plucks. But many other tracks show clear influences even if they're not named for them. ""Kyaaaaaaa"" partially turns into a rumbling surf tune, and ""Ikkkyokume"" snakes into a chase song for a 1960s spy flick. ""2534"" could have been called ""Lightning Bolt"", as their influence is clearest here (the band is also one of Nisennenmondai's stateside supporters). At just over one minute, it's their shortest song, but the best cuts here are the longer tracks, where the repetitiveness pushes forward and retreats over each iteration.</p><p>Nisennenmondai's eagerness to depart from tonality and form is inherited as much from the free jazz tradition as from these named influences. Zaikawa and drummer Sayaka Himeno set up pins for guitarist Masako Takada to strike down via her looser, messier playing. Her approach doesn't contribute much to the overall ""small women with big chops"" image of the band-- she's not as muscular, her parts not as technically impressive-- but her guitar morphs while the others stay the same. No matter what sits on top, an undulating groove hides beneath noise, thanks to the Zaikawa and Himeno's precise rhythm. They'd be fun to watch, not for their size, but for how quickly and often Himeno's hi-hat must turn to shards. It almost seems a shame to put much distortion and noise over them, but their cleanest, most repetitive tracks, like ""Kyuukohan"", clearly fall behind the ones that combust. Nisennenmondai are pummeling, but not because they use repetition as a way of imprinting songs to your memory. They're bigger than that.</p></div>"|12400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12400-nejitori/|6.6|Jessica Suarez

That's not to reduce Brighton's Metronomy to a fad, especially since they've proven their mettle on dozens of high-profile remixes and their own impressive singles. The transition from producer to album-oriented act, however, remains tricky for them. Their 2005 debut, <em>Pip Paine (Pay the ¬£5000 You Owe)</em>, incongruently forced together delicate dancefloor pop and harsh rock touches. And while <em>Nights Out</em> better corrals these influences, creating a much more cohesive album, it still suffers from a lack of consistency.<br/><br/>Metronomy singer/producer Joseph Mount describes this album as a soundtrack to a tumultous weekend, and sure enough, there's plenty of drink-fueled lust, driving, partying, and of course, dancing. It's no surprise, then, that two songs about cardiac health-- ""My Heart Rate Rapid"" and ""Heartbreaker""-- contain the majority of the album's hooks. The former is a ramp-up to Metronomy's bacchanalian rager, its chipmunk vocals speeding up lockstep with the disco pulse. ""Heartbreaker"" immediately follows, squashing those increased serotonin levels, with Mount's effects-free vocal performance recalling Junior Boys vocalist Jeremy Greenspan's breathy bedroom croon. The resulting ballad, effective enough to tame the otherwise ADD production, provides an emotional comedown that also gives the listener's ears a breather.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Metronomy can't maintain the momentum. Throughout the album, they sprinkle cute instrumental interludes that feel more like production exercises than effective segues. The vocals don't exactly carry their weight, either. With the exception of ""A Thing for Me""'s excited cat calls, Mount douses his voice in self-conscious irony (and studio effects) to the point of near-total detachment. It'd be unfair to expect Metronomy to match the hooks of similar acts like Hot Chip or LCD Soundsystem, but even those groups manage to give the heartstrings an occasional tug, whereas tracks like ""Back on the Motorway"" or ""On Dancefloors"", two of the more tender moments here, simply seem to ponder how kooky 80s music was.<br/><br/>Then again, these drawbacks don't make <em>Nights Out</em> any less appropriate a soundtrack to clubbing adventures, pub crawls or one-night stands. Although uneven, some of these random spurts seem to disorient intentionally, like ‚ÄúSide 2‚Äù, the dark intermission track that ushers in the album's, uh, darker second side. Yet the frenzied first half showcases Metronomy's strengths right off the bat: glitzy glam rock guitars butting heads with stubborn electro beats, neurotic disco paeans, and loads of synths. <em>Nights Out</em> may turn in a little too early, but for about three songs, it wrests synth pop supremacy from Metronomy's many competitors.</p></div>"|12403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12403-nights-out/|6.6|Adam Moerder

Beyond their crunchy idyllic roots, living among the ferryboats and the evergreens, they share a unique way of seeing. One finds in their work a hallucinatory vision of the Pacific Northwest halfway between ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Northern Exposure"": Warm but weird, by turns cheerful and dark, equally alive to the natural and supernatural, and pleased as punch to tread the rim of civilization. Part of the younger generation of K Records renaissance men, the two collaborated on several under-the-radar releases as members of D+, a band that broadened the Olympia label's tradition of shaggy, sardonic, post-hippie quirk.</span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""line-height: normal;"">Last year, Blau put out the softly electronic¬†<em>Dance Positive</em>, where he folded 10 songs written by Bret Lunsford, a cornerstone of both D+ and the region's indie-rock titan Beat Happening, inside his own shabby-chic arrangements. What we got was a melancholy cross of folk motifs and Casio textures. Faithful to his DIY sensibility, it nevertheless proved a confident leap forward for Blau, whose previous record¬†<em>Beneath Waves</em>¬†(2006) wandered with mixed results, as his urge to experiment with diverse instruments and registers could, depending on the song, either smartly embellish or rudely interrupt the introspective moods and words.<br/> <br/> <em>Nature's Got Away</em> attains a better balance of cohesion and chaos. Taking less risks than¬†<em>AM</em>, Blau still offers the same tattered arrangements and battered delivery that made¬†<em>Dance Positive</em>¬†such a warmly imperfect record; Blau arguably packs some of the best work of his career into the back half. And it is clear that, as he tames and grooms his unruly aesthetic, he has been sliding into a plot between the Microphones and Smog. It's hard not to feel Bill Callahan's dry winds of irony in ""2 Becomes 1"" and ""Mockingbird Diet"". The latter song turns an Animal Planet vignette into a poignant ballad, relying on fuzzy, shivering guitar melodies and jangly percussion to lend the Darwinian lyrics a sting of resignation.</span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""line-height: normal;"">Even ""That's The Breaks"" and ""Make Love That Lasts"" have that touch of the cold-blooded old times, forging bittersweet moments from here-and-there backup vocals. At the same time, the airy delicacy of ""Stream of Ganders""-- evident not only in the spacious production and roaming composition, but in Blau's wispy, breathless singing-- remind us that he is still a disciple of Phil Elverum. (Though we get the sense that Blau's sonic debt to Elverum has been gradually paid down since the <em>Beneath Waves</em> days.) With the plastic, loitering tones of thrift-store keyboards, this song is also the obvious bridge from his past work to his present.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""line-height: normal;"">In the trek from Point A to Point B, Blau has drawn from eclectic sources. He nodded to A.A. Milne, the creator of Pooh and relatively unsung poet, on <em>AM </em>and Japanese esotericists like Tori Kudo, of Maher Shalal Hash Baz, on this one. Here the rainbow of left-field influence even extends to Allan Kaprow, whom Blau channeled to describe his creative method, explaining that ""the director of a musical piece may find that the less heavy handed one can be, the more one can approach hands free and even getting out of the way of a 'happening.'""¬†<em>Nature's Got Away</em>¬†retains the light touch of a seasoned auteur, but make no mistake: Blau's strange and humble presence is deeply felt. And he brings to each song a little whimsy, woe, and a deceptively intricate way to mash these sensibilities together.</span></span></p></div>"|12404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12404-natures-got-away/|7.7|Roque Strew

Even <em>Metal Machine Music</em>, released two years later, wouldn't be enough to cleanse the general antagonistic shock of what people at the time took to be Reed's worst album, ever.</p><p>Still, in retrospect, it's a funny album to pick on. A loose song cycle (it turned out that many of the <em>Berlin</em> tracks actually dated back to Reed's days in the Velvet Underground, and ""Berlin"" was a song on Reed's first album) about an unhappy couple, Jim and Caroline, living in the titular city, the record's absurdly depressing but hardly offensive. The characters do drugs, domestic violence, custody battles; eventually, Caroline kills herself. <em>Berlin</em> ends with Jim idly staring at a photograph of the dead mother of his children. Bob Ezrin, who would soon produce Pink Floyd's <em>The Wall</em> and who, at 23, had already produced Alice Cooper, brought a characteristically lush orchestration to the proceedings, but then again, <em>Berlin</em> was clearly a melodrama. Ezrin and Reed had their eyes on a stage adaptation before the record even came out; <em>Berlin</em>'s reviews (and sales numbers) ended that project. To listen to <em>Berlin</em> now is to be basically mystified as to what everyone was so upset about, besides maybe its lack of a ""Walk on the Wild Side Pt. II"".</p><p>Reed shrugged it off, and went on to do things worthy of his audience's newfound hatred. <em>Berlin</em>, meanwhile, crept back into style. By the 1980s, Julian Schnabel was getting divorced to it, and by December 2006, the collective entreaties of various arts luminaries around New York finally led Reed to revive his second-most reviled creation for a four-night run at Brooklyn's St. Ann's Warehouse. Ezrin was back, to conduct; Sharon Jones, Antony Hegarty, and the entire Brooklyn Youth Chorus were on hand to provide backing vocals. Schnabel designed the set, and his daughter made a film to be projected against the back of it. The event was stoked by adulatory, apocalyptic press coverage (""Sometimes called the most depressing album ever made‚Ä¶"" began one <em>The New York Times</em> paragraph) and an improbably beautiful week of melancholy, late fall weather. I attended on the year's last non-holiday Sunday.</p>
<p>The mood, of course, was reverent, but what I remember best were the evening's various breaks in character: Reed finishing a guitar solo and sighing into the mic, ""Oh, back into the land of depression now""; Ezrin, ecstatic by the post-concert exit, excitedly calling <em>Berlin</em> ""music to cut your wrists by"" even as he couldn't stop grinning. Applause all around. This past July, Schnabel brought out a film of the performances and now, a tidy two years after the concerts, Matador's releasing the soundtrack, officially making a one time 21st Century revival of a 1973 rehabbed classic into a modest cottage industry.</p>
<p><em>Berlin</em>, the original, is a wonderfully claustrophobic, textured, and wandering suite of unwaveringly dark songs. It has an indelible arc-- from the muted ""Berlin"", through the false dawn of ""Caroline Says Pt II"", all the way to the all-time underrated ""Sad Song"", which is simultaneously one of the most overblown and most moving songs Reed ever wrote. (Ezrin's hand is, uh, visible: ""Sad Song"" is a sublimely bastardized Pink Floyd song, from the psych solos to the children's chorus at the end, and not the least bit worse for it.) At a trim 10 songs, <em>Berlin</em> casts an undeniable spell: a tiny poison pill, a maudlin little melodrama.</p>
<p><em>Berlin</em>, the musical/film soundtrack/live album, occupies perhaps an even more specialized niche: a time capsule of a time capsule, a memory engine for those who were there, a document of four woozy nights of goodwill, friendship, and adulation. The undeniable truth about the <em>Berlin</em> performances were that they were fundamentally celebratory-- Reed had fun, Ezrin, Antony, Jones, and the kids had fun, and the audience, as telegraphed by this recording's roaring approval and reverent silences, definitely had fun. The cameos, minimal during the performance, are barely audible here: Sharon Jones battling Reed on ""Oh, Jim""; Antony warbling backups on ""Caroline Says, Pt. II""; blistering guitar solos from Steve Hunter, who joined Ezrin as the other veteran of the original <em>Berlin</em> sessions, on nearly every song. Reed's line readings aren't sarcastic, but they are crooked-- like every ""Don't Look Back""-type performance I've seen in the past few years, it's obvious even as Reed's enjoying the ceremony he's trying to dodge the predictability that comes from playing an old album, in full, without deviation. There are some uniquely embarrassing moments, too: the exceptionally ecstatic audience surge that goes up at the intro to ""How Do You Think It Feels"" is almost definitely the sound of 800 or so people thinking they're about to hear ""Walk on the Wild Side"", which starts in more or less the same way.</p>
<p>Alas, that one was not to be. Reed speeds through ""Candy Says"" (or rather, Antony does), ""Rock Minuet"", and ""Sweet Jane"", and then, exeunt. It's exhilarating to hear <em>Berlin</em> back and alive, but then again, it was more exhilarating to <em>see</em> it back and alive: an option now available to whoever cares to pick up Schnabel's DVD. It's a miracle Reed was able to turn one of the most hermetic albums of all time into a communal experience, but <em>Live at St. Ann's</em> was also a one-time-only slight of hand: <em>Berlin</em> will forever be a record best enjoyed alone.</p></div>"|12391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12391-berlin-live-at-st-anns-warehouse/|7.2|Zach Baron

Considering all his demons, is it any wonder that Greg Dulli keeps himself busy? Four albums with the Twilight Singers in six years, his ongoing collaboration with Mark Lanegan as the Gutter Twins, long days spent on the road and long nights spent on stage: post-Whigs, Dulli's been a pretty busy guy.<br/><br/>Still, there are lulls, and those lulls must be filled. Last year, between a Twilight Singers tour and the Gutter Twins' debut, Dulli appeared at two benefit shows for the Vera Project, a Seattle music and arts center, performing mostly stipped-down versions of Twilight Singers songs. Of course, there's only so far down you can strip a personality as outsized as Dulli's, but the experiment did alter his usual context. Clearly Dulli thought something of the two nights as well, as now about a year later he's distilled the tapes to a solid digital-only live disc-- surprisingly, his first live record-- which captures him at a transitional but no less compelling stage.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, ""The Killer"" shows off Dulli's formidable presence-- the performer's intense vocals alone nearly matching the song's studio bombast. The same goes for Dulli's rendition of ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"", which is less dense than the version found on the Twilight Singers' <em>She Loves You</em> but no less powerful for it-- especially once you factor in the creeping violin of guest Petra Haden. ""Candy Cane Crawl"", from <em>Powder Burns</em>, is Dulli at his dark best, while ""King Only"" is presented with a radically different arrangement that (by necessity) jettisons the skittering drums, horns and other atmospherics and (more impulsively) tags on a nod to Led Zeppelin's ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"".<br/><br/>Dulli being Dulli, that's not the extent of the covers included here. <em>Live at the Triple Door</em> includes Dulli's first stab at J√≥se Gonz√°lez' ""Down the Line""-- now a live Dulli staple-- as well as a fusion of George Harrison's ""Isn't It a Pity"" with Donovan's ""Atlantis"". It also includes versions of ""Tonight"", from the Afghan Whigs' 1992 breakthrough <em>Congregation</em>, and ""Front Street"", subsequently recorded with the Gutter Twins. The addition of songs such as these lends the disc a truly archival quality, with Dulli straddling past and present while confidently peering ahead to the near future.</p></div>"|12423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12423-live-at-the-triple-door/|7.0|Joshua Klein

Secret Machines' Benjamin Curtis met On!Air!Library!'s Alejandra and Claudia Deheza in late 2004 when their groups were opening for Interpol, and they embarked on an on-and-off collaboration over the next four years. EPs came out on Sonic Cathedral and Table of the Elements last year, and a remix of ""Iamundernodisguise"" was featured on Prefuse 73's <em>Preparations</em>. As for the full-length, Curtis <a href=""/article/news/45018-ben-curtis-talks-school-of-seven-bells-secret-machines""><strong>told Pitchfork's Matthew Solarski</strong></a> that same year that it was in the middle of a lengthy production and revision process.</p><p>The extra time was worth it.¬† <em>Alpinisms</em> retains distant echoes of the EPs, and vocal similarities to O!A!L! are inevitable, but in SVIIB‚Äôs freshest and best-yet iteration, Curtis has moved the band from downtown-arty to diaphonous, nestling the Dehezas' voices in a thick, glimmering haze.¬† The two released versions of ""Face to Face on High Places"" are the clearest chart for the band's evolution: The EP version, with the same melodic hook as its later incarnation, and some frenzied drumming by Rhys Chatham associate Joe Stickney, is certainly appealing in its own right.¬† It‚Äôs also nearly nine minutes long, vamping on its abrasive fire-dance rhythm for the last four. On <em>Alpinisms</em>, ‚ÄúFace‚Äù is focused and gleaming, the drums cycling like faraway pistons and the gossamer verse melody recalling My Bloody Valentine's ""Blown a Wish"".</p><p>Like the rest of the album, ""Face"" revels in its artificiality, but in an uncanny way that works to heighten its foregrounded aura of mystery and mysticism. The other synthetic pleasure at work on <em>Alpinisms</em> is the way it hails and integrates its influences: Listen to the gothic shimmer of ""Connjur"" and ""My Cabal"", and try to avoid thinking of the icy soundscapes of Cocteau Twins' <em>Heaven or Las Vegas</em> (indeed, Robin Guthrie remixed ""My Cabal"" for the Sonic Cathedral 7"") and Flood's cavernous production on Depeche Mode's <em>Violator</em><em>.</em> The record might be named for the most frigid of outdoor activities, but, like its most recognizable predecessors, <em>Alpinisms</em> thoroughly blurs the distinction between chilly and warm.<br/><br/>Yet despite the band's modernist approach to emotions and sensations, their abstruse lyrics and spiritual overtones most directly recall John Lennon's late-1960s, post-India assimilation of the mundane with the mystical. On songs like ""I'm Only Sleeping"", ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", and ""I'm So Tired"", he used the liminal state between deep sleep and an Eastern-tinged state of full consciousness as a metaphor for wandering through life in a trance. The woozy chorus of SVIIB's single ""Half Asleep"" takes the same approach, making dream pop in the strictest sense: ""What begins as an unguarded train of thought slowly can become an addiction to the slumber of disconnection"". It looks wordy in print, but sounds effortless on record, the Dehezas' pristine voices elegantly negotiating a rising and falling cadence. On the album's longest and most ""Eastern"" song ""Sempiternal/Amaranth"", they get to the point more directly-- ""We walk around half-there all the time""-- before vamping for a few minutes on the lyric ""Allow yourself to be relieved"", or the new ""Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream.""<br/><br/>Throughout <em>Alpinisms</em>, the group finds a perfect middle ground between the indie realms of tribal and choral, layering electronic flourishes without letting them overwhelm the arrangements.¬† Opening track ""Iamundernodisguise"" accomplishes this most effectively, with the Dehezas' mantra-like vocals riding the thrumming groove of the verse, until the lyric ""my heart a drum of water"" propels the song into a wordless chorus. <br/><br/><em>Alpinisms</em> has its pitfalls: ""For Kalaja Mari"" and ""White Elephant Coat"", though not failures, combine mid-record to edge the record too closely to the New Age valley it so effectively skirts elsewhere. But at their best, School of Seven Bells know what they want to achieve, and do it gracefully and with style to spare. They supposedly took their name from a mysterious South American pickpocketing school, which trained its students by having them practice on mannequins equipped with bells-- one of them rings: the student fails. It's an effective metaphor for how SVIIB synthesizes its music: Carefully pulling from a myriad of sources (inspirational and instrumental), but doing so with cleverness that only comes from discipline and patience.</p></div>"|12399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12399-alpinisms/|8.0|Eric Harvey

In fact, it's a bit surprising it wasn't dealt sooner. Vic Chesnutt has been collaborating with anyone in earshot for nearly twenty years, Elf Power have deep tendrils in the local scene (the band's label is releasing this album), and the Amorphous Strums are, well, amorphous. The project, which involves a tour as well as this album, is meant as a sort of cooperative where everyone does the heavy lifting and everyone gets their names on the spine. Chesnutt gets first billing presumably because he wrote the songs, does most of the singing, and infuses every syllable with his usual skewed wit and gallows humor, but the other eight musicians pull their weight on the off-kilter jangle of these nine songs.</p><p>These are very angry songs, as if the musicians' outrage has been festering for, say, eight years (just to grab a number out of the air). <em>Dark Developments</em> may not be intended to be an election-year album, but hearing it during an election year intensifies its power. That title specifically refers to overexposed dark-room prints, as Chesnutt makes clear on the creaky ""Stop the Horse"". Rather than toss the mistakes in the trash and start a new exposure, he keeps them all in a ledger he found in the trash, useless but artfully interesting. Similarly, this power nonet know that their frustrations with dark social and political developments may do little to change real-world problems, but work with the audacious hope that that it might fuel their music and lend weight to these dissenting songs. ""Little Fucker"" is a deliciously nasty send-off, presumably to the current administration, sharing its venomous sentiment with ""Teddy Bear"", which could be a celebration of January 20, 2009: ""He ain't ever comin' back!"" the gang all sing jubilantly.</p><p>As on Chesnutt's previous album, <em>North Star Deserter</em>, a sense of doom shoots through the songs, manifest in the Dutch political cartoon reproduced on the back of the CD packaging. If on that previous album Chesnutt had mixed emotions about the end of the world-- is it even worth saving?-- here he sounds a bit cheerier, thanks perhaps to the local setting (it was recorded in Athens rather than in Montreal) and the local friends. Whether out of despair or some sense of relief, these songs contain a great deal of humor, some of it topical and some of it likely inside jokes. ""Phil the Fiddler"" lists characters and their occupations-- ""Dick the butcher, Tom the bootblack, Ralph the collier""-- that takes on a strange force after the presidential debates, as if Richard Scarry were speechwriting for McCain-Palin. We even get the return of Chesnutt's mouth trumpet on ""We Are Mean"", a city/country contrast that puts the lie to certain beliefs about heartland America. ""In the city we are social, in the country we are mean,"" Chesnutt sings mischievously, and Elf Power and the Strums join him for the emphatic chorus: ""I declare that everywhere we are mean/ We are mean/ We are mean/ We are mean!""</p>
<p>As a backing mini-orchestra, Elf Power and the Strums may not be as inventive as Lambchop or as dark as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, but they give Chesnutt just want he needs: a relaxed and less rehearsed environment. But their imprint is all over the album. Opener ""Mystery"" has an almost ""Earth Angel"" vibe, thanks primarily to Derek Almstead's slow-dancing bass, which is a thoughtful melodic anchor throughout the album. ""Bilocating Dog"" sounds a gleefully strange as its title suggests, and the band explode the closing psychedelic jam of ""Phil the Fiddler"". Here's hoping this mass collaboration isn't a one-off project, as each party seems to invigorate the others. Either way, I know who I wish I'd watched the election night returns with.</p></div>"|12396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12396-dark-developments/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

But with each new album from Heremma's post-Trux outfit RTX, it becomes clearer that former partner Neil Hagerty-- now releasing increasingly inscrutable albums under the Howling Hex mantle-- was holding her back from her true calling of denim'n'leather metal queen. Where 2004's RTX debut <em>Transmaniacon</em> featured a handful of Trux rewrites and last year's <em>Western Xterminator</em> detoured into strung-out psych-folk, with <em>JJ Got Live RaTX </em>(actually a falsely advertised studio album), Herrema exorcises every last vestige of her former band's avant-rock influence and finally gets to enjoy the 1988 she never got to experience the first time around. <br/><br/>But for Herrema, the real attraction to hair-metal isn't the panty-peeling riffs and wiggly fingered solos-- though those are in bountiful supply here-- but its androgynous implications. With her lean, statuesque physique and long blonde locks, no one is ever going to mistake Herrema for a guy, and yet, when she asks ""are you a boy, or are you a girl?"" on the track of the same name, you have to wonder if she's talking into a mirror, her gruff, three-cartons-a-day voice sounding several degrees more ballsy than those of the spandexed pansies who once populated ""Headbanger's Ball"". The irony of 80s cock-rock is that most of the dudes singing it sounded like they didn't have one, so leave it to a woman to correct that deficiency; with the talk-boxed strut of ""You Should Shut Up"" and the open-sunroof charge of ""How'd You Do It?""-- RTX's most straight-up, no-bullshit rocker to date-- Herrema embodies the kind of ultimate rock chick that a young Vince Neil or Axl Rose aspired to be when they were applying their eyeliner and hairspray. <br/><br/>Where past RTX albums sometimes apologized for their heavy-metal love with deliberately messy production (as if still trying to appease Royal Trux's indie-centric fanbase), <em>JJ Got Live RaTX</em> unashamedly revels in authentically 80s details: The slowly swelling synth intro to ""You Should Shut Up"" that sounds like Giorgio Moroder's intro theme to <em>Scarface</em>; the squealing lead fills on ""Are You a Boy or Are You Girl"" that fly by like orange globulars on ""Guitar Hero""'s expert level; the crunchy-riffed break in the middle of ""Virginia Creeper"" lifted straight from Scorpions' ""No One Like You""; the brief, ZZ Top <em>Eliminator</em>-style techno-boogie denouement to ""Mr. Wall"" that's actually more interesting than the song that precedes it. RTX can't transcend all genre clich√©s-- namely, numbskull choruses (""Fuck that! We don't give a shit!"") and intentional typos (""Too Badd"")-- but they score where it counts: In the power-ballad department, though <em>JJ Got Live RaTX</em>'s lone slow-dance moment, ""Cheap Wine Time"", is less ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" than ""Sweet Jane"" had the Velvet Underground been the house band at the Whisky in 88 instead of the Factory in 66.¬† In a sense, RTX's de-cheesing of 80s pop-metal couldn't better timed-- provided that disgruntled GN'R fans spend their <em>Chinese Democracy</em> refund money on this.</p></div>"|12407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12407-jj-got-live-ratx/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Maybe you'll also remember it as the year A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip came out with his solo debut, <em>Amplified</em>, which pushed his bohemian rap a bit further upscale into champagne sleekness and drew a lot of ""pop sellout"" accusations from people who'd eventually wind up mourning co-producer J Dilla six and a half years later. Still, <em>Amplified</em> has aged pretty damn well, as predicted by Kris Ex, whose prescient <em>Rolling Stone</em> review called it ""music that's gonna represent laid-back hip-hop two minutes into the future."" <br/><br/>But that's been damn near it from Tip on the new-release front. 2002's <em>Kamaal the Abstract</em> was a drastic 180 from <em>Amplified</em>'s conscious-player style towards neo-soul/jazz fusion light on actual rapping, and Arista thought it was too leftfield to release-- one year before they let Andr√© 3000's half of the new OutKast album drop the same M.O. onto an unsuspecting world. A couple of years later, Tip put together a more cohesive, head-nod-worthy return to lyricism, <em>Open</em>, that Arista didn't ""get"" either-- so he shopped it to Universal/Motown, reconfigured it as <em>Relive the Moment</em> and later <em>Live at the Renaissance</em>, and saw <em>that</em> get shelved, too (though a number of promos were pressed and shipped in 2006). It was about that time that A Tribe Called Quest held some much-geeked-over reunion shows, which meant that the idea of Q-Tip as a solo artist went on the back burner.</p><p>And so it's after that ridiculously long and convoluted voyage that I'm happy to declare <em>The Renaissance</em>-- a mostly new, tight refining of everything Q-Tip's done in his attempts to break his solo sophomore jinx-- the album people were spending the last nine years hoping he'd make. It features the deep, smooth neo-soul-tinged production from <em>Amplified</em> and final Tribe record <em>The Love Movement</em> (complete with a post-mortem Dilla contribution for a bit of that Ummah feel), pushes it simultaneously outwards towards both classic boom-bap and fusion experimentalism, and signals a welcome return of that familiar elastic, swing-cadence voice dropping jewels on the mic. <br/><br/>Maybe the first thing you'll notice is the mood: Q-Tip sounds enthusiastic and vibrant where many other aging conscious rappers have been playing it tense or guarded. This album shows a man infatuated with love and life without sounding maudlin: ""Gettin' Up"", produced by Q-Tip, takes an old early 1970s Black Ivory single, makes it gleam with modern sheen and lets Tip loose on the kind of love jones you'd expect from a man with 15 years' worth of relationship experience and maturation since ""Electric Relaxation"". The love-and-war soldier's story ""We Fight/We Love"" and the abstract sociological breakdown of ""Manwomanboogie"" couch things in conflict and struggle, but there's always some glimmer of hope and humanity at the core. He even sounds diplomatic when he's being accusatory and frustrated with a lover, as he does on ""You"": Despite the communication breakdowns, suspicion of infidelity, and admission that all the blame rests on the other party, he still concludes it with a potential reconciliatory gesture: ""We'll make amends if you admit it/ We can ascend if you're committed/ Your heart, is it in it?"" And when he extends that gratitude and love towards his profession, modestly reaffirming his place in hip-hop in ""Johnny Is Dead"" or rattling off a catchy chronological list of legends in ""Life Is Better"", his passion is infectious. <br/><br/>Most of <em>The Renaissance</em>'s appeal owes to its mellow, welcoming tone-- maybe a bit more aspiring-Stevie than fist-pumping ""Scenario""-memorizers might prefer-- but its production has a lot of kick to it: There's a sly reworking of Can's jittery, restless Krautfunk song ""Aspectacle"" in ""Manwomanboogie"", a classic-style no-nonsense butt-moving soul jazz groove in ""Official"", propulsive funk fusion guitar riffs on ""Johnny Is Dead"", and rave synths on ""Shaka"" that sound like Kanye's ""Flashing Lights"" switched from wistful to triumphant.</p><p>And the Abstract still knows how to amp a listener up on the mic, too. ""Dance on Glass"" is the lyrical highlight of the album: it starts out with an unaccompanied verse that addresses the whole state-of-rap argument with a veteran's wisdom, but Tip keeps going a cappella for an entire minute, dropping lyric after acrobatic lyric in his bouncy voice, building tension to the point where you're split between anticipation for the beat to drop and the feeling you wouldn't mind if it never did. (Then the beat <em>does</em> drop, and it sounds like <em>People's Instinctive Travels...</em> deep cut ""Rhythm (Devoted to the Art of Moving Butts)"" gone space-age. That works.) There's also the two-part ""Move"", produced by Dilla, which has an agitated Tip bucking the industry and calling out ""cold grits without the hot sauce"" MCs over a hacked-up, downpitched chunk of the Jackson 5's ""Dancing Machine"" before settling down just enough to drop life-story knowledge over whirring Moogs and concrete funk breaks. <br/><br/>If there's any weakness to the album, it's that Tip spends a fair amount of time on hook duty-- at least when he's not relinquishing it to a silky Raphael Saadiq, a ghostly-sounding D'Angelo, or a just-there Norah Jones. And even if his voice is a welcome presence after all these years, it's a bit odd to hear a Q-Tip album where he's literally the only dude rapping on it. But it's hard to complain too much about such a brighter-day kind of record, and it feels like the perfect album at the perfect time-- released on Election Day, appropriately enough, as the ideal soundtrack for Barack Obama winning the presidency. It says a lot that Tip alludes to <em>Midnight Marauders</em> more than once and, rather than a cheap reminder of what used to be, he leaves you glad he's still holding that same spirit.</p></div>"|12413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12413-the-renaissance/|8.4|Nate Patrin

For more than a decade, the British producer has made sample-driven house music that has elevated the concept of musique concr√®te (the fetishization of found sounds) into a storytelling platform. Where early composers Pierre Schaeffer and Edgar Var√©se sampled their surroundings-- often indiscriminately-- out of a sense of curiosity and playfulness, Herbert has turned the physical act of sampling itself into part of the text. 2005's food industry-themed <em>Plat du Jour</em>, for example, included samples of 3,255 people biting into an apple, chopsticks drumming on egg cups, and someone blowing over the top of a bottle of San Pellegrino.<br/><br/>This kind of sampling isn't merely a spice in Herbert's work; it's the basis for it. Any given album might feature hundreds of similarly interesting footnotes, many of which are rooted in larger cultural memes or personal anecdotes. As you might imagine, it's become nearly impossible to listen to Herbert's music without some sort of accompanying crib sheet for context. Correspondingly, it's become increasingly difficult to extract the novelty of his process from the quality of his output. Might you enjoy this album's ""One Life"" a little bit less had you not known that it sampled the incubator that kept Herbert's son alive for two months? By being his most musically inferior album in a long time, these are the kinds of questions that <em>There's Me and There's You</em> forces on the listener.<br/><br/>This is the second album from Herbert's Big Band outfit, and while the handle implies an aesthetic shift from electronic music to avant-jazz, the effect isn't as pronounced as it reads on paper-- Herbert's always mined from both genres regardless of his moniker. As with <em>Plat du Jour</em> and 2006's terrific <em>Scale</em>, it's also a protest album: his original concept was to record it entirely out of sounds sampled inside Britain's House of Parliament, a request which the government eventually denied. His frustration at that denial has manifested in songs with stronger, more overtly global and political themes than before; each beep in the aforementioned ""One Life"" represents 100 deaths resulting from the Iraq War; ""The Story"" features the rustling and crinkling of select British broadsheets and glossy celeb-obsessed tabloids; ""The Yessness"" features snippets from 100 figures of power saying the y-word, and, perhaps most notably, ""Knowing"" is a social experiment that finds 100 volunteers from around the world (of which, full disclosure, this writer is one, even if I can't figure out which ""you"" is mine) each contributing one word to the song's snaking melody.<br/><br/>So yeah, the tricks are clever; unfortunately, musically, <em>There's Me...</em> is an overstuffed mess. Its songs aren't compositions so much as overlong, hypercaffeinated patchworks of disparate vocal vamps, noxious brass motifs, and uncharacteristically obnoxious asides. Herbert's collaborations often hinge on his vocalists, and in that department, even though he's often veered dangerously close towards adult contemporary sensibilities, he's generally shown a taste for singers with subtle, light inflections. <em>There's Me...</em> finds him working for the first time with Zimbabwe-born Eska Mtungwazi, a vocalist whose range, while impressive, makes no allowances for subtlety. Songs like ""Pontificate"", ""Waiting"", ""The Yessness"", and ""Breathe"" (none of them great shakes to begin with) are overwhelmed by her spotlight-seeking mannerisms. She squeaks, whispers, bleats, purrs, and over-emotes in perfect synchronicity with the music's many needless hairpin turns; it's all pretty much as tiring and joyless as it sounds.<br/><br/>On paper, Herbert's sampling exercises read as thoughtful and as antagonistic as ever (one track features volunteers dispensing Britney Spears' noxious ""Curious"" fragrance throughout the halls of the British Museum). Without the music to support them, though, they end up feeling more like stunts, supplementary rather than complementary. Lots has been written about Herbert's elevation of process, particularly as it pertains to electronic music, and when it's all said and done, he's probably going to go down as one of sample-based music's most interesting and innovative thinkers, but <em>There's Me...</em> is a sign that he's overcorrected a bit too hard in that direction. This was probably a hugely satisfying record for him to make; it's a shame it's not nearly as much fun to listen to.</p></div>"|12417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12417-theres-me-and-theres-you/|4.0|Mark Pytlik

It could be a personal characteristic of her downcast voice, or perhaps a nod to her Rust Belt upbringing, but the 19-year-old singer/songwriter, who recorded her 2007 debut under the name Chittlin', sounds immediately distinctive and poised on ""Kiss Me Again"", the opening track on her second album, <em>With Blasphemy So Heartfelt</em>, calling to mind but ultimately surpassing comparisons to Hope Sandoval or Syd Straw. ""You can kiss me again if you want, I don't mind,"" she sings, yet she sounds actively invested in her romantic passivity-- a fascinating and endlessly listenable contradiction.</p><p><em>Blasphemy</em> was produced by fellow Ohioan Dan Auerbach, who corralled Mayfield into singing on the Black Keys' <em>Attack &amp; Release</em> earlier this year. Here he swathes her vocals in dreamy country production, heavy on rumbling guitar and even heavier on atmospherics that give her songs a vinyl noir feel that's more <em>Brick</em> than <em>Double Indemnity</em>. His slurring riffs illuminate the inner turmoil of ""I Can't Lie to You, Love"", and a banjo adds spikes to ""We've Never Lied"" as Mayfield sings, ""I'll talk to whoever I goddamn wanna."" Her quavering vocals are textured in reverb, as if to suggest that her lyrics are inner monologues resounding in her love-fevered brain. Emphasizing the physical-- breath on neck, hand clasping hand, lips against lips-- her lyrics suggest a world where kisses can still pack contradictions and lying is an everyday occurrence, and her subtly dramatic vocals bring that world to life.</p><p>As jaded and adult as she comes across on ""Call Me"" and ""Bible Days"", Mayfield still sounds like she's describing the tribulations of young love, although that assertion may be due to her age prompting preconceptions in the listener. Still, concrete descriptions like ""I was walking with your left hand in my back pocket"" (from the lilting, resigned ""For Today"") sound like she's singing for all the Lindsay Weirs of the world. Noting Mayfield's age shouldn't suggest she has little authority beyond the late-teen set. Just the opposite: The relationships she describes on <em>Blasphemy</em> are supremely dark and compromised-- not sweet but scarred. On ""The One That I Love Best"", as Auerbach churns out a thundery riff, she yearns for the guy who's ""my first thought in the morning,"" but then she mentions he's also ""the reason that I cry myself to sleep."" It's these complexities and contradictions that make <em>Blasphemy</em> more than just a collection of conflicted love songs, as in total they cohere into a strong statement of identity by a woman who is finding out that she might just be ""happier when I'm alone.""</p></div>"|12398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12398-with-blasphemy-so-heartfelt/|8.2|Stephen M.

The Stockholm band, which takes its name from Tolkien, certainly has the right trappings. Their songs are about vikings. Their album covers overflow with swords, shields, and he-men. Live, they don drinking horns and make sure to toast the crowd: ""Sk√•l!"" But beneath their imposing beards lie men of the 21st century. Their ineptitude with charcoal grills is <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-XdPbkEVxc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">well-documented</a></strong>. Their albums are made with axes-- the six-string kind-- through the latest in recording technology. Vocalist Johan Hegg proudly told me about how he once parallel-parked the band's van and trailer in Manhattan.</p><p>But even without the traditional instruments used by other viking metal bands, Amon Amarth amply convey ""vikingness."" The secret lies in their melodies. They're strong, simple, and often romantic. Amon Amarth songs are instantly recognizable, a feat for a band whose singer favors a one-note growl. Early efforts were raw and dark, reflecting origins in straight-ahead death metal. Over time, the band's rhythm section grew sturdier, as did its songs. Since 2002's<em> Versus the World</em>, Amon Amarth's sound has solidified around several core elements: basic riffs, memorable melodies, and Hegg's voice, which is somehow deeply expressive.</p><p><em>Twilight of the Thunder God</em> merely refines these elements, but the tune-up is noticeable. In a discography filled with catchy songs, these are some of Amon Amarth's catchiest. The band has stripped things down to bare essentials, all of which advance the cause of creating tunes that stick in one's head. (Fredrik Andersson still has a charming tendency to overplay bass drums, however.) The efficiency here approaches that of pop music. ""Twilight of the Thunder God"" is a barreling anthem about Thor (natch), ""Where Is Your God?"" is a barreling anthem about defeating the enemy (again, natch), and ""No Fear for the Setting Sun"" is yet another barreling anthem about battle. But the band switches speeds enough to prevent monotony. The driving pulse of ""Free Will Sacrifice"" evokes a down-tuned Judas Priest; ""Guardians of Asgaard"" is a mid-paced march with a surprisingly tender solo.</p>
<p>Though Amon Amarth sometimes get tagged as ""death metal,"" that's not really accurate. Some of their riffs recall the sturm und drang of early Swedish death metal, and Hegg's vocal approach is pure death metal. But the band's sound is rather uplifting. Even its songs about death are stirring-- think Valhalla, not hell. (""Runes to My Memory"", from 2006's <em>With Oden on Our Side</em>, is a downright tender ode to imminent death.) This spirit is probably what has enabled Amon Amarth to amass an astoundingly loyal following. At a recent sold-out show at New York's Irving Plaza, the band had a 1,000-strong crowd singing along. To see men, women, metalheads, and Wall Street types, young and old, chanting, ""Oden! Guide our ships!"" was quite heartwarming.</p></div>"|12393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12393-twilight-of-the-thunder-god/|7.7|Cosmo Lee

They're hard to organize, hard to pack into the basement at Cake Shop, hard to pay-- usually have a lot of friends and family to draw to shows, though. Indie rock's most widely known symphonic-pop chorale, the Polyphonic Spree, started making their joyful noise eight years and three albums ago now, but those white-robed masses surrounding ex-Tripping Daisy frontman Tim DeLaughter have varied over time. Another venerable mega-group, Danielson Famile, have the advantage of being a Famile (the Famile that plays together, stays together). Broken Social Scene members keep putting out solo albums.</p><p>The stark odds against super-sizing your band can make the venture an ideal one if you're the type looking to escape the gray practicalities of adulthood. Community was built into the songs on Swedish pop collective I'm From Barcelona's 2006 full-length debut, <em>Let Me Introduce My Friends</em>; underground hit ""We're From Barcelona"" and its endearing YouTube clip implied a global village-- or at least a Coca-Cola commercial. Somehow, the 20-plus-member group managed to coordinate their calendars and come to North America for a handful of much-praised U.S. shows. Even if I'm From Barcelona had been a quartet, their songs are designed for many voices.</p><p>Their second album, <em>Who Killed Harry Houdini?</em>, asks a question laid out in 2006 biography <em>The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero</em>. The book suggests the master magician and escape artist was poisoned, rather than killed by a ruptured appendix (likely cause: punches to the stomach by a McGill student, trying to test Houdini's vaunted strength). <em>Houdini</em> sounds like an attempt to escape from the predicament of the sophomore album, making more nuanced use of orchestration and sticking with a comfortingly sweet and na√Øve tone while also expanding its perspective. March-like first single ""Paper Planes"" has sunny guitars, whistling woodwinds, neighbors' sex, and ""The Cosby Show"", slyly invoking the way we pass unseen through the lives of strangers; free mp3 giveaway ""Music Killed Me"" adds a kiddie-psych spaceyness, using the choral vocal to full rhetorical advantage. ""Andy"" politely invites a guy-- with the same name as one of my local bartenders!-- to join the band. But nothing here has the euphoric simplicity of ""We're From Barcelona"", or quite the infant-""Calvin &amp; Hobbes"" wisdom of ""Chicken Pox"" and ""Treehouse"".</p>
<p>If a second album is tough, try a second childhood. Yup, there's a lullaby, the sentimental but meandering ""Gunhild""; a banjo and synth twee-pop meditation about floating away between ""Headphones""; a catchy minor-key Casper cartoon that develops into a musing on mortality, ""Little Ghost""; a light ditty about ""Ophelia"" driving away in one of her two cars; and ""Houdini"", a clambering power-popper about magic powers, with an almost-spoken melody that reminds me of Snow Patrol's ""How to Be Dead"".</p>
<p>The emotional guts of the album, though, are in the upbeat ""Mingus"", which expresses a fear of growing up that recalls but doesn't rival Ben Folds' ""Still Fighting It"". The flawed but winsome finale, ""Rufus"", envisions a giant silver labrador in a wide-open golden valley of crowd-handclapping twee-rock ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". And in the final line, frontman Emanuel Lundgren-- whose name is similar to Manuel, the ""Fawlty Towers"" character from whom I'm From Barcelona take their name-- sings, ever so softly: ""In my heart, I'm still a kid."" As Momus once <strong><a href=""http://imomus.livejournal.com/386867.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a></strong> of childhood, ""It's an invention of adults."" The Boy Least Likely To's fantastic 2005 debut album will be a tough act to follow, too-- and they're only a duo.</p></div>"|12416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12416-who-killed-harry-houdini/|5.9|Marc Hogan

In between is some of the most casually amazing pop music ever made, but these two bookends-- ""Dreams Never End"" and ""World in Motion""-- tell you more about the group than you'd think. <br/><br/>The interesting thing about ""Dreams Never End"" is that Peter Hook sings on it, and he does as well as Barney Sumner would have. Following the suicide of Ian Curtis and subsequent retirement of the Joy Division moniker, New Order began as a band without a frontman; the trick of them is that they stayed that way, even after Sumner had become the regular vocalist. Sumner's often flat, affectless voice might be a familiar point of contact with New Order but it's rarely their focus. Their notoriously careless lyrics-- Sumner has generally made great play of how last-minute they are-- are a further sign of the group's discomfort with the way rock music tends to be lensed through its singer. So it's no surprise the 12"" format was so attractive for New Order-- more lovely space for the vocals to wander out of entirely. <br/><br/>So if Sumner isn't a frontman, what is he? ""World in Motion"" suggests an answer. It's a song that uses soccer as a metaphor for raving and resistance-- ""Beat the man! Take him on!""-- so why not use the sport as a metaphor for what the band who made it do? In those terms, Sumner isn't a frontman, he's a target man: The striker whose job isn't just to score, it's to hold the ball so his teammates can move forward and into play. New Order's secret is their fluidity, their easy sharing of the spotlight. At any time in any song, any one of them might provide the hook-- the bright drama of Gillian Gilbert's keyboards, the giddy sequencing of Stephen Morris' percussion, Peter Hook's famously liquid basslines, or indeed Sumner's own guitar lines, as gorgeously full and melodic as his vocals are blank.¬† <br/><br/>This interplay defined New Order from the beginning-- on <i>Movement</i>'s centerpiece ""The Him"", your focus flickers from the tribal drumwork to the blocky thrash of Sumner's guitar to the stern jab of the bass: it's almost never on the words. But New Order really woke up to their own potential when they bought a nightclub and started making music that might fill it, and for this side of the story you need the second discs of these generous releases, filled with singles and 12"" remixes. <br/><br/>The deluxe reissue package can feel like the industry's last throw of the back catalogue dice-- hoover up all sorts of bits and bobs and use historical context as a figleaf to persuade people to buy the same record a third or fourth time. But not this time. If New Order had never released singles, how would we remember them now? Perhaps authors of a solid body of pop work, dependable fixtures of the alternative scene whose success nobody could begrudge. These albums are often excellent, but of these five packages, the ""bonus disc"" beats the first at least three times. <br/><br/>The rhythmic experiments on <i>Movement</i>, for instance, make more sense when you hear them alongside the mechanoid funk of ""Everything's Gone Green"" and the sudden break into joy of ""Temptation"". The second disc here takes the bleak pressure off the original album, letting it breathe not as an awkward afterthought to Joy Division but as a group pushing that band's musical ideas further. Their most coherent and underappreciated record, it's still an uncomfortable listen, with tracks like ""Senses"" savage in a way they never were again. <br/><br/><i>Power, Corruption and Lies</i> exists in the shadow of two remarkable singles: ""Temptation"" and ""Blue Monday"". The first had established the band's emotional signature: a bittersweet rush of hard-won, inarticulate bliss. Many of their most glorious tracks-- ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", ""Run"", ""Your Silent Face"", ""Thieves Like Us""-- feel like returns to the well ""Temptation"" dug, which makes it even more perverse that the 1987 re-recording of that track is an absentee here: The original's greatness is rougher-edged. ""Blue Monday"", meanwhile, took the icy landscape of <i>Movement</i>-- and hence its loyalist audience-- fully onto the dancefloor. <i>Power, Corruption and Lies</i> works to reconcile these seminal records: It's a spiky take on synth-pop, with some of the group's giddiest music. The uninhibited tumbles of ""Age of Consent"" and ""The Village"" suggested a band drunk on possibility; ""Your Silent Face"" married rhythm and grandeur and anger. <br/><br/>A generally sympathetic re-mastering job can't disguise how clattery and sharp <i>Low-Life</i> sounds: Hailed at the time as New Order's first really great album, it's now the one that seems most time-bound thanks to its brash mid-80s keyboard sounds. There's plenty of drama here, but the album's two stand-out tracks are best heard in their bonus-disc extended versions. At full 18-minute stretch, ""Elegia"" more than earns its pomposity, while the long mix of ""The Perfect Kiss"" has some claim to be the decade's greatest 12"" edit: A riot of interlocking bass and keyboard hooks, breathless handclap drums, and five or six different climaxes. <br/><br/>The bonus disc of <i>Brotherhood</i> has two more peerless 12"" mixes-- Shep Pettibone's extensions of ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and ""True Faith""-- but the album itself is New Order at their most wickedly ramshackle, turning away from the brash electropop of <i>Low-Life</i> and covering most tracks with the messy jangle of Sumner's guitar. They sound, for the first time since <i>Movement</i>, like an indie band-- but a superb one: Four musicians at ease with each other and themselves, combining on tracks like ""Way of Life"" to provide a feast of hooks that leaves the listener breathless and delighted. Elsewhere, ""1963"" and ""True Faith"" suggested they had the songs to be chart fixtures on relatively conventional terms; ""Touched By the Hand of God"" and the pointless ""Blue Monday '88"" hinted they might be running out of steam. <br/><br/>Instead they made arguably their best record. Past the red herring of ""Fine Time""-- a dance music band ""going dance,"" and one of those rare gags that stays entertaining-- <i>Technique</i> takes the easy interplay and full-band sound of <i>Brotherhood</i> and drenches it in good Ibiza vibes. Each track, as it leads you into a fluid maze of melody, is a hug from a stranger you've known all your life. ""Nothing in this world can touch the music that I heard as I woke up this morning,"" sang an awed-sounding Sumner, catching the album's mood perfectly. <br/><br/><i>Technique</i> is magnificent, but it has the weakest bonus disc of all-- listless B-sides and instrumentals, and merely functional remixes. Standard-bearers for club culture in the alternative world for most of the decade, New Order never really adapted to dance music's victory in the UK mainstream: They made more great records, but no more great 12""s. With their sound perfected, they also stopped surprising us: So even though this isn't all the records they made, these collectors' editions still feel like a complete story of this most accidental of bands.</p></div>"|12418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12418-movement-power-corruption-and-lies-low-life-brotherhood-technique-deluxe-editions/|9.3|Tom Ewing

In between is some of the most casually amazing pop music ever made, but these two bookends-- ""Dreams Never End"" and ""World in Motion""-- tell you more about the group than you'd think. <br/><br/>The interesting thing about ""Dreams Never End"" is that Peter Hook sings on it, and he does as well as Barney Sumner would have. Following the suicide of Ian Curtis and subsequent retirement of the Joy Division moniker, New Order began as a band without a frontman; the trick of them is that they stayed that way, even after Sumner had become the regular vocalist. Sumner's often flat, affectless voice might be a familiar point of contact with New Order but it's rarely their focus. Their notoriously careless lyrics-- Sumner has generally made great play of how last-minute they are-- are a further sign of the group's discomfort with the way rock music tends to be lensed through its singer. So it's no surprise the 12"" format was so attractive for New Order-- more lovely space for the vocals to wander out of entirely. <br/><br/>So if Sumner isn't a frontman, what is he? ""World in Motion"" suggests an answer. It's a song that uses soccer as a metaphor for raving and resistance-- ""Beat the man! Take him on!""-- so why not use the sport as a metaphor for what the band who made it do? In those terms, Sumner isn't a frontman, he's a target man: The striker whose job isn't just to score, it's to hold the ball so his teammates can move forward and into play. New Order's secret is their fluidity, their easy sharing of the spotlight. At any time in any song, any one of them might provide the hook-- the bright drama of Gillian Gilbert's keyboards, the giddy sequencing of Stephen Morris' percussion, Peter Hook's famously liquid basslines, or indeed Sumner's own guitar lines, as gorgeously full and melodic as his vocals are blank.¬† <br/><br/>This interplay defined New Order from the beginning-- on <i>Movement</i>'s centerpiece ""The Him"", your focus flickers from the tribal drumwork to the blocky thrash of Sumner's guitar to the stern jab of the bass: it's almost never on the words. But New Order really woke up to their own potential when they bought a nightclub and started making music that might fill it, and for this side of the story you need the second discs of these generous releases, filled with singles and 12"" remixes. <br/><br/>The deluxe reissue package can feel like the industry's last throw of the back catalogue dice-- hoover up all sorts of bits and bobs and use historical context as a figleaf to persuade people to buy the same record a third or fourth time.

It is in service of both of those quirks that he presents his latest project, Reefer, a partnership with L.A. hip-hop producer Daddy Kev that resulted in a Maui-created, self-titled album. In a year in which Thorburn has already released two albums-- Islands' mediocre sophomore effort and the middling debut of folk duo Human Highway-- one must wonder if the prolific songwriter is spreading himself too thin. But Daddy Kev, who adds a sense of play with his cut-and-paste samples and beat-heavy production, and Hawaii, with its hula melodies and lush vacation living, prove to be an inspiring collaborator and muse, respectively.<br/><br/>Despite Daddy Kev's pedigree, however, <em>Reefer</em> isn't an obvious hip-hop collection; it is more informed by its Polynesian birthplace than a street-wise aesthetic. After all, practically the first word spoken on this collection is ""aloha."" But despite oozing Don Ho-worthy ukuleles and steel guitar, the album does have one big hip-hop moment: ""Crony Island"", which, like Island's ""Where There's a Will There's a Whalebone"", uses Busdriver's flow and some stuttering, heavy beats to infuse jagged edges and a sense of urgency into these languid tropical sounds. Daddy Kev also adds three ""interludes"" that act like skits on a rap album, breaking up the songs with moments of spoken-word samples set to easy ukulele strums and fuzzy effects.<br/><br/>The rest of the album is just four original songs of Thorburn's whispery warble, minor-key melodies, and cymbal-heavy beats that explore the dark side of tropical getaways-- what, you expected sunny songs from a guy with lyrical obsessions with ghosts and bones?-- and a cover of ""Blue Moon"" that's spun out of a hollow drum machine beat, ambient twinkles, and Thorburn's surprisingly rich baritone croon. Tracks bleed into one another using the sounds of the surf as a guide, and because crashing waves and dreamy ukulele noodling tie together the songs and interludes, <em>Reefer</em> feels like one long track, a cohesive statement instead of nine separate compositions. <br/><br/>The collection ends with two remixes, which, unfortunately, feel tacked on (perhaps a tactic to keep the short album from being simply an EP?). And though they are nowhere near as good as any of the originals, they at least come from producrtion geniuses Flying Lotus and Dntel. The latter's take on ""Hit and Run"" (the better of the two) bleeds the track of its slightly sinister organ and melancholic guitar and, instead, leaves a spare, echo-laden shell in their place. And with a robotronic effect added to Thorburn's vocals amidst such a cavernous arrangement, the song suddenly becomes more remote and lonely. It may not be a pleasant listen, but it is an affecting one. ""Let It Go"", however, which is marked by breezy ukulele and the prettiest, warmest chorus of the album, is, in Flying Lotus' hands, simply a wash of glitchy, ticking-time-bomb beats, spacey videogame effects, and an overall clinical vibe. With barely any vocals or semblance of melody, it bears no resemblance to Reefer's version-- which is perhaps the best song on the album-- but though disappointing, it is an intriguing experiment.<br/><br/>Despite it all, <em>Reefer</em> is Thorburn's best album of the year, and it is so successful because it feels tossed off, like he's not trying so hard. Maybe the islands-obsessed Islands frontman should take more vacations. Although judging from how often the guy likes to work, that's probably unlikely.</p></div>"|12408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12408-reefer/|7.0|Rebecca Raber

The underrated but undeniably sullen <em>12 Memories </em>documented Travis wrestling with capital-I issues personal and political, both which could be were manifested in Fran Healey's decision to wear a beret. But last year, the foursome wisely eschewed Anton Corbijn's artwork and video direction and welcomed Nigel Godrich (and their old font) back into the fold with a comeback-via-throwback, and the warm reception of <em>The Boy With No Name </em>likely has inspired Travis to go back even further into their history with its quick follow-up-- namely, the first song on their first record: ""All I Wanna Do Is Rock"".</p><p>And while <em>Ode to J. Smith </em>was probably the most fun record for the band to make since <em>Good Feeling</em>, it's also the worst one since then-- and its problems are almost exactly the same. Travis aren't the kind of band you spend a lot of time trying to wrap your mindgrapes around (""If we turn/ We might learn/ Learn to turn"") and they don't hit at a gut level viscerally. Their best songs tend to go for the spaces in between, the heart, the lump in your throat. Or, more succinctly, Travis don't rock, which is why all the newfangled additions, the edgeless distortion and feedback, the aggressive lyrical themes, the forceful vocal lines, the constipated boogie tempos that are supposed to justify the turgid melodies, are so easily peeled away to reveal sadly generic cores.¬†</p><p>If the retreat into simplicity is to be expected from a band that pretty much answers to itself at this point (<em>J. Smith </em>is the first release on their Red Telephone Box label), the decision to self-produce follows as well, but what Godrich understood is that Travis does wide-screen better than high-rise, and as such, a lot of the more immediate songs buckle under the weight of failed experimentation. ""Get Up"" and ""Something Anything"" feature Healey retreating from the painfully overt politicking of <em>12 </em>Memories, pining for a general faith and assertiveness, but they come off more as mere sketched vehicles for clicky desktop drumming and an out-of-nowhere Slash turn, respectively. At least the latter has a hook that could've been a contender if it didn't wear out its welcome. And then there's first single ""J. Smith"", which is emblematic of where the record fails: It so obviously wants to be the biggest thing Travis has ever done, tacking on piercing guitar bends and an Arcade Fire choir, and each new trick is stitched together by verses of dithering modesty. There are reasons the bands Travis seek to match often find themselves described as ""unapologetic.""</p>
<p>I suppose it's defeatist to use <em>The Man Who </em>as a comparison-- especially since Travis went so obviously out of their way to make <em>J. Smith </em>sound nothing like it. But trying to forge a new identity doesn't necessarily mean working against your strengths: It's no shock that the most memorable tune here, ""Quite Free"", features a longing ""Knives Out"" vocal line. It's understandable that these guys are seeking an escape hatch from competing with Keane, Snow Patrol, and Coldplay, considering that they've spent the past seven years making writers rue those ""next Radiohead!"" plaudits. But one Stereophonics is more than enough.</p></div>"|12410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12410-ode-to-j-smith/|5.0|Ian Cohen

Their last album, <em>Let's Build a Fire</em>, gently suggested tomfoolery with its <span class=""nfakPe"">jack</span>-<span class=""nfakPe"">in</span>-<span class=""nfakPe"">the</span>-<span class=""nfakPe"">box</span> title track opener and the Postal Service-tinged ""Steal the Blueprints""-- the lovely, inspiring highlight that began with a simple ""Hey"". The band was just starting to sweeten their electronic pop with little creative inklings. Alas, their latest album, <em>Xs on Your Eyes</em>, is calmer, but with no surprises. And unless I'm a weary parent, that's a crank I'm not too keen on turning.</p><p>Some of the same <em>Fire</em> elements are here: horns, classical guitar, pedal steel. But gone are the trumpets' screeches and full-fledged commands to burn away the past. Where <em>Fire</em> was bright-eyed, <em>Eyes</em> is bloodshot from a serial-sneezing fit caused by its own emotional dust bowl. The last time I heard about chalk outlines (""You'll Catch Your Death""), sedation (""Xs on Your Eyes""), and potential you'll never see (""Unsung""), I was on an Elliott Smith binge one rainy day ago. But the gloomy vibe that permeates here has no real force. With songwriting duties split between primary songwriter James Baluyut and Patrick Ramos, it's hard to imagine why the album feels just so damn bleak. Certainly the trio has been celebrating these past couple of years: Ramos had twins at the end of that year, Baluyut joined the fatherhood club last year, and drummer Chris Deaner filled in as Kelly Clarkson's drummer on her tour. But I'm guessing the recent procreation explains the unyielding, more ""mature"" hush that pervades the album.</p><p>Opener ""Tired Eyes"" starts the album off well enough. It begins with a dreamy vibraphone, then bursts and abruptly takes off before working its way back into its tinkling intro. The jolt is a neat trick, particularly if the listener has turned up the song because she couldn't hear it too well, but the subsequent build and retreat gets boring fast and slips into the background. ""Snowblind"", the album's first single, has a thin intro that builds and wanes, giving way to ""Subdued""'s flimsy falsetto one-word chorus, which warm guitar strums and some confident drums carry and save. These decent spots come early, and then the album starts to putter halfway through, until ""Marina"" invites back the pedal steel for some welcomed variation. The bouncy title track ends the album with what sounds like a Death Cab-circa-<em>Something About Airplanes</em> B-side.</p>
<p>There's nothing startling about <em>Eyes</em>, no loving slap of surprise. It might be a lot to ask of an electro-acoustic pop band, but after <em>Fire</em>, I expected their streamlined velocity to make their follow-up fun. +/- fans may very well adore the ebbs, wanes, and occasional flatlines, but from a band ensconced in the Google unsearchable elite, I demand more whimsical mischief.</p></div>"|12394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12394-xs-on-your-eyes/|5.0|Kasia Galazka

Among the first words on the intro are ""Dipset for life,"" which Santana proceeds to back up by starting an entirely new collective with dudes that will ring bells to the diehards: Un Kasa, Jim Jones... come to think of it, pretty much everyone except Cam'ron. <br/><br/>A large part of Dipset's appeal stemmed from their ability to deadpan through every ridiculous stunt they ever pulled, and the same suspension of disbelief applies to <em>Skull Gang</em>. Throughout the hour-plus runtime, they conduct their sexcapades in half-million-dollar condos, haters whittle the day away opining about Skull Gang (""Who Said That Skit"" is a must-hear), hooks are built off sentiments like ""I'll kill a nigga for my chai-yeen"" delivered T-Pain-style, and Young Jeezy's <em>The Recession </em>is seen as trenchant political commentary. Moreover, the album assumes that there's a sector of hip-hop listeners that thought Cam'ron's <em>Killa Season </em>was too cerebral and uplifting-- or at least that some will cop this because Santana learned how to use Auto-Tune. There's even something called ""Shorty Dirt Bike Skit"" on it (lasting all of four seconds).<br/><br/>Apparently, an integral part of growing up is having the realization that skulls aren't that cool, and following that, there's a clear lean towards naughty locker room talk-- just about any time you hear a woman's voice or a woman being addressed on the record, you'll probably feel bad for her. That goes for the remake of Case's mahogany slow grind ""Touch Me Tease Me"", in which the female vocal begs for her hair to be pulled in between compliments about ""smell[ing] sweeter than a daffodil"" (rhymes with a certain hygiene product) and boasts about ""your insides squishin' like a Hot Pocket."" Same for the fake Ciara trying to sell ""Body Like a Maserati"" and its confusing metaphor about speeding tickets. If there's anything that makes it abundantly clear that Dipset are spirited if not a little misguided, ""Electric Relax"" becomes a blowjob tutorial, but I guess that's closer to its original intent than ""Peepin' My Swag"", which flips the bareknuckled grime of ""Uptown Anthem"" into a tribute about proper accessorizing.<br/><br/>Even if reviewers are the only people to listen to this straight through, there's still plenty to enjoy-- ""Drama Fold"" sets the bar terribly high for <em>Skull Gang</em>'s hilarious ignorance, as does the silly ""Got Money"" redux ""What You Reppin' (Skull Gang)"". Most of it involves Juelz growing into a lead role (""Tony Danza, look who's the boss""), and whether it's due to the fact that he's the most recognizable voice of the team or that he's just that much more skilled, he effortlessly steals any track he's on.<br/><br/>It's tough to say whether this is some new beginning for Juelz, as since at least 2005 his entr√©e into pop's landscape has been through an open seat at the coke-rap table-- if <em>Skull Gang </em>is infinitely more tangible than the ever-postponed <em>I Can't Feel My Face </em>tape with Lil Wayne, it's about a fraction as anticipated. The evidence is in the perfectly competent gun-clappers like ""Aggy"", lofted by a simmering sax loop, and ""Problems"", which manages to be a decent ""message"" song. But Juelz always boasts that it's more than music, and although Skull Gang have an admirable chemistry, they hew far too close to the scads of NYC mixtape lurkers to which Dipset once proved to be a far more excitable alternative.</p></div>"|12397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12397-presents-skull-gang-takeover/|5.5|Ian Cohen

Just like most other assets, goodwill decreases over time, and to many, so too has Devendra Banhart's. ""Fuck Enron,"" Banhart sings on <em>Surfing</em>, his new collaboration with Priestbird's Greg Rogove; it'd be funnier if his public reputation hadn't taken a similar nosedive.¬† <br/><br/>Banhart also sings ""Fuck Abe Lincoln"" moments later during ""A Gun on His Hip and a Rose on his Chest"", and follows that song with an ""Earth Angel""-style slowdown titled ""Chicken Titz"", so some of the skepticism here might be warranted. <em>Surfing</em> falls firmly in the ""screwing around"" category of side projects, with the duo unleashing all manner of styled silliness: ""Duck People Duck Man"" muses about Trader Joe's hummus; ""Adam and Steve"" knowingly bites the Strokes' ""Hard to Explain"" and Wham!'s ""Careless Whisper""; ""Hamman"" vamps rudely about the availability of...ham. ""Gun on His Hip"" is a sloppy Xerox of ""Bo Diddley"" and the most likely to offend: In addition to aforementioned gems about Enron and Abe Lincoln, we're treated to ""Fuck the president/ Iiiiiiin his asshole.""¬† <br/><br/>Whether this sounds stupid will likely depend on your feelings toward Banhart, but regardless, it's more compelling to hear him err on the side of nonsense than hard art: Toss-off ""Duck People"" can be a decent tune and a bad joke or the reverse, but it's easier to take than last year's ""Sea Horse"", an eight-minute, multi-part suite about, among other things, sea horses. In fact, SoCal goof fits Banhart pretty well: Think Frank Zappa with (way) less musical chops.¬†</p><p>The record does offer some genuine treats. The vaguely Brit-poppy ""Theme From Hollywood"" seems like a play on Banhart's semi-recent run of publicity, with a chorus that minces up ""Too much fun in Hollywood"" with ""Too much fucking Hollywood."" Opener ""Crop Circle Jerk '94"" offers a loping guitar riff and a sighing chorus, and, importantly, doesn't seem to have much to do with its title. ""Lavender Blimp""'s thin, trebly guitars blanket a gallant chorus. ""Hamman"" is alternately forceful and beguiling. The title track is a drawn-out paean to escapism and rehab (""Surfing/ Never alone/ Surfing/ Your mind is blown""), but its undulating piano chords seem like a hearty nod to Animal Collective.<br/><br/>Alas, <em>Surfing</em> troublingly ends with three plodding failures (including the seven-minute ""Sayulita"") that feel at odds with the record's fuck-all spirit. Too much of Banhart's bothersome wordplay-- ""eat your yeast infection,"" ""chode-alicious""-- falls far south of ""having a good time."" What <em>Surfing</em> does do well is present a more relaxed Banhart-- a let-the-tapes-roll collaborator with bad-in-jokes and sly pop instincts. <em>Megapuss</em> has the feel of a short-lived side project, but it may ultimately prove a blueprint for the type of left-field, anti-hero path for which Banhart seems suited.</p></div>"|12409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12409-surfing/|5.9|Andrew Gaerig

Swanning through press conferences, photocalls, and video shoots with an air of amused detachment, dutifully turning up to the studio for a couple of hours work, dating supermodels and movie starlets, and all the while quietly banking royalty checks-- it's a good living.<br/><br/>Fabrizio Moretti is a classic case in point. Brilliant name, great hair, stupidly handsome, and what did he even do on those Strokes records? On most of those tracks it sounds like they plugged a fritzy old drum machine through a busted radio. And he still winds up dating Drew Barrymore. Now, just to rub it in, he's casually made the best record involving a Stroke in years.<br/><br/>The film writer David Thomson once posited the secret genre of movies where nothing really happens. <em>Meet Me in St Louis</em>, where the Smith family almost moves to New York-- but then doesn't. Or <em>Rio Bravo</em>, where there's supposedly some business about a jailbreak or something, but the film is really about Howard Hawks, John Wayne, and Dean Martin sitting around on a Hollywood set wisecracking, flirting with Angie Dickinson, singing the occasional song with Ricky Nelson, and not quite believing their luck that they get paid for this. <br/><br/>I can imagine <em>Little Joy</em> as one of those movies. Here's the storyline: Fab has just split up with his Hollywood royalty squeeze, and while drowning his sorrows at some insanely lucrative half-hour festival appearance in Portugal, winds up knocking back Casa Nobles backstage with a Brazilian named Rodrigo Amarante. Amarante used to be in this band Los Hermanos, which means ""The Brothers""-- perfect for an Apatow bromantic comedy. Fab digs Rodrigo's slow sad croon, which floats on a breeze blown all the way from his own childhood back in Brazil. They hatch a plan to hook up some time back in L.A. <br/><br/>Soon enough they catch up again, jamming at Devendra Banhart's pad up in Topanga (possible part for Russell Brand?), and decide to get a place down in Echo Park, work on some songs and see what happens. By now Fab has hooked up with this broad Binki Shapiro-- crazy cute, with a voice like summer wine. The three of them spend their afternoons hanging out a down-at-heel neighborhood bar (it's called Little Joy), mixing their own cocktails, strumming on ukuleles, and singing along to a jukebox stuffed with Brazilian bossa nova, Portuguese fado, Julie London ballads, some early Mazzy Star, one of those Spanish Jonathan Richman albums, and the Velvet Underground's <em>Loaded</em>. And that's it... and it's pretty great.</p><p><em>Little Joy</em> is not going to stop the world or change your life, but it's one of the sweetest, most listenable, consistently enjoyable records of the season. ""No One's Better Sake"" mixes things up a little, trying out a soused skank. ""Keep Me in Mind"" sounds a little like the Strokes if Julian Casablancas mellowed out and better carried a tune. ""Unattainable"" puts Shapiro's smoky, sleepy-eyed voice center stage. If you were going to download one track, you'd go for ""Don't Watch Me Dancing""-- another Shapiro number, it sounds like a standard already, like if Lou Reed gave one of his Mo Tucker tunes to Ann-Margret. <br/><br/>LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy once told me he could imagine in 15 years' time, he might be having a barbecue, and someone would dig out the Strokes' debut from a pile of old CDs and, as the half-forgotten power-pop drifted across the summer lawns, he would realize, ""You know what? That was a great little record! A perfect barbecue record!"" The modest genius of <em>Little Joy</em> is that now he (or you) doesn't have to wait 15 years.</p></div>"|12412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12412-little-joy/|7.2|Stephen Trouss√©

Perhaps most notably, Oakland-dwelling Brendon Whitney-- who had left Portland, Maine, to hook up with the rest of anticon.'s preliminary influx of artists following 1998's Deep Puddle Dynamics collaboration (alongside Doseone, Sole, and Atmosphere's Slug)-- headed back home after almost a decade out West. Despite a break in recording solo, and moving away from the community that had supported him since the early days, Alias has had little down time musically. In 2005 he released the instrumental LP, <em>Lillian</em>, with his younger brother Ehren, and the subsequent year he teamed up with New York-based singer Tarsier for another full-length, <em>Brookland/Oaklyn</em>, which paid tribute to trip-hop while expanding their combined interest in contemporary electronica. Fittingly for Alias' first solo recording in five years, <em>Resurgam</em> takes its title from his hometown's Latin motto, translating to ""I will rise again.""</p><p>Although anticon. originally provided an alternative platform for geographically disparate but like-minded hip-hop artists when it started in the late 1990s, the label, continually flexible and innovative with its boundaries, has since grown to be equally associated with electronica and indie rock. This unification of genres has been a trademark of Alias since the beginning, and on <em>Resurgam</em> he successfully skips and fuses musical elements from across the board. The opening track, ""New to a Few"", has its bearings firmly in 80s-era hip-hop and flares with energy and hard-line beats before sliding into vast electronica with the aptly named ""I Heart Drum Machines"". Here, Boards of Canada-style soundscapes open up the space before collapsing into an upsurge of intricate rhythms and melodic samples that alternately break the flow then bring it back forward. These beats are often fairly stock in sound, but it's Alias' melodic additions that keep the steady pace of <em>Resurgam</em> engaging and refreshing, throwing some unexpected turns into the mix and proving that, stylistically, anything goes.</p><p>Fellow anticon. founder Yoni Wolf (aka Why?) joins Alias on the standout track ""Well Water Black"", where he ties together his distinctive, introspective monologues with a falsetto melody that wouldn't be out of place on a Flaming Lips record, pitching everything against a jolly background of virtual glockenspiel, happy-go-lucky handclaps, and what sounds like the album's only (thoroughly spectacular) live drum patch. And while tracks such as this conjure images of walking down a sunshiny Oakland avenue with jingling pockets and a spring in one's step, Alias' dice have many sides. Fast-forward six minutes and he's back to an airy instrumental that makes room for all the other ideas searching for space: sad-eyed acoustic indie with the One AM Radio on ""Weathering""; propulsive urban electronica on ""Autumnal Ego""; clear echoes of Four Tet on ""Death Watch""; and the kind of euphoric jams one might expect to hear in a European disco club on ""M.G. Jack"".</p>
<p>While <em>Resurgam</em> is a record of many different moods, and unashamedly derivative of Alias' influences, it maintains a distinctive, concrete consistency. This is largely due to Alias' impressive talent for arrangements; the material is deftly woven with a great ear for detail, and there really is something to appeal to almost everyone. It is precisely this autonomous yet inclusive approach to creating music that Alias and his anticon. cohorts have always supported, and what makes <em>Resurgam</em> even larger than the sum of its parts.</p></div>"|12395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12395-resurgam/|7.0|Mia Lily Clarke

(Even Amazon is conflicted about whether to spell the band's name with the full expletive.) Their moniker comes from a Naked City song, and the band is similarly freewheeling. One foot stays in grindcore, but the other plays a game of Twister with electronics, noise, and feints at jazz. Over the band's 10-year history, it has amassed an astonishingly lengthy discography comprising dozens of splits, singles, EPs, and full-lengths. With a revolving door of personnel totaling eight ex-members, the band's sound has mutated in an ad hoc fashion. Current vocalist Mel Mongeon, a woman with a man's growl, and increasingly powerful production have stabilized the band somewhat; 2006's<em> Stigmata High-Five</em> was merely spastic in comparison to previous epileptic leanings.</p><p><em>Disgorge Mexico</em> was written during a two-week road trip from the band's native Canada to Mexico. The title comes from a Mexican death metal band, but it also describes the record's creation. Burnt out after the road trip, the band went on hiatus and left the album unfinished. Gradually, after months of personal issues, they reconstituted themselves. The result reflects the angst and uncertainty of that time. Mongeon's lyrics and album artwork are rife with images of construction and destruction: ""The entire walls were built with sand bricks/ As everything piled up, the architect was left drained."" Related are themes of betrayal and refuge denied: ""How could it be?/ The same hands that gave peace and shelter to the ones that they are about to destroy."" Mongeon isn't slave to her printed lyrics, often glossing over lines to emphasize crucial words rhythmically. Sound is the weapon; text is simply its icing.</p><p>Fittingly, Mongeon's bandmates wrap her in walls of dread. The production is monstrous, and Fuck the Facts now sound like they are exploding instead of imploding. ""No Return"" careens through hairpin turns; ""Dead End"" bulldozes like a slowed-down Slayer. Electronic dalliances are at a minimum here; big riffs are not. This is the heaviest Fuck the Facts have ever been, which suits Mongeon's buckets of black paint. ""Driving Through Fallen Cities"" glints with Metallica-esque clean tones, complete with melodic solo, then drops into ""La Culture du Faux"", a doomy soundtrack for end times. ""The Storm"" is an exhilarating steeplechase through anthemic melodies, chugging hardcore punk riffs, and a limber jazzy break. While such diversity is not new for Fuck the Facts, it now comes in a huge metallic exoskeleton. It's scary because it's scared, a nightmare amplified and multi-tracked. Instead of slipping through fingers, Fuck the Facts now engulf.</p></div>"|12392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12392-disgorge-mexico/|8.0|Cosmo Lee

The tight synchronicity of their rage-dance breakout <em>You're a Woman, I'm a Machine</em>-- released just a year before the split-- instead suggested that the look-alike duo shared a close creative companionship. In retrospect it seems like they probably didn't agree on an aesthetic, either. Keeler's post-DFA79 project MSTRKRFT abandoned rock for techno, shooting for (and whiffing on) a heavily vocodered brand of Daft Punk-inspired electro-house. Grainger's debut solo effort Sebastien Grainger and the Mountains, meanwhile, ventures down a more conventional rock path with tracks built loosely on the singer-songwriter template. <br/><br/>Of course, that term conjures unpleasant notions of watered-down Dylanisms (or worse), but Grainger isn't a neo-folkie (though signing to Saddle Creek might further the misconception). He's simply fleshed out his own song sketches with power-pop and, occasionally, 1970s arena rock to create a batch of high-energy, radio-friendly tunes. The record showcases Grainger's command of melody and works best at its most straightforward, like on album opener ""Love Can Be So Mean"". As with other standout moments here, the song leans heavily on the beefy power chords of Cheap Trick and an anthemic, new wave-inspired chorus. With its shouts of ""Let's go out tonight!"" the track could easily play beneath a high school flick's one-last-party sequence, and I mean that wholeheartedly as a compliment. ""Who Do We Care For?"" and ""American Names"" are equally catchy, the former recalling QOSTA's heavy-rock crowd pleaser ""Go With the Flow"" with its handclaps and insistent piano backing.¬† <br/><br/>Had Grainger chosen to stick with this direction, <em>Mountains</em> would be perfectly listenable (if unoriginal), but unfortunately the album's strong lot ends with ""American Names"". On the bulk of the remaining songs, he shows an odd tendency for lopsidedness-- songs with capable choruses but plodding, asymmetrical verses. Make it through the inconsistent patches of ""I Hate My Friends"" and ""By Cover of Night (Fire Fight)"" and you'll be rewarded with sugary sweet, synth-flecked hooks and left feeling only half-satisfied. On these songs (and others such as ""[I Am Like a] River"" that suffer a similar fate), it feels like Grainger is going for a Pixies-esque verse/accessible refrain format, but this material-- uncomplicated and pop-reaching as it is-- doesn't call for it. <br/><br/><em>Mountains</em> also trots out a handful of head-scratchers. Grainger includes a live version of ""I'm All Rage"", and while it's a good recording of a decent song, it protrudes oddly from the studio cuts surrounding it. There's a Jay Reatard-type punk thrasher called ""Niagara"" that is said to have been originally posted to MySpace after a night of heavy drinking and doesn't appear to have been improved upon since. Decisions like these make for an effort that, at times, comes across as slapdash and underthought. Which brings us full circle, in a strange way, to DFA79. While the band surely wasn't the headiest of its era, there was a svelte, muscular quality to their music-- a feeling that any excess had been cut away-- that is absent from this record (and, it's worth noting, Keeler's work in MSTRKRFT). What's also gone is the sense of aggression and urgency that made <em>You're a Woman, I'm a Machine</em> so impressive. Perhaps the same discord that did the group in was also its driving force; we'll never know. What does seem clear now, though, is that if Keeler and Grainger continue at their current pace, they won't soon escape the shadows of their former glory.</p></div>"|12406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12406-sebastien-grainger-and-the-mountains/|5.8|Joe Colly

(I mean, it's not like we've had any meetings or anything, so it's possible I might be the only one.) I dig Queens and the manfully cool bulldozing thing they do, it's just that I find Josh Homme's side gig with Jesse Hughes offers more of the stuff I crave from my rock-- sex, humor, fun.</p><p>I know Eagles are far more derivative than Queens, but they steal from the best and have a great time doing it. So many new groups are so damn serious and reverent about stealing from post-punk or Neil Young or Bob Dylan that it's refreshing to see a couple of guys swipe from the Rolling Stones, New York Dolls, and Led Zeppelin and not give a shit about piety. Their newest record, <em>Heart On</em>, delivers more of the same, though that's hardly a pejorative when more of the same means being tighter than Cindy McCain's smile.</p><p>To be fair, <em>Heart On </em>does reveal a slightly maturing sense of pop songcraft from Hughes and Homme: the disarming loveliness of ""Now I'm a Fool"" is equivalent to those pop-tinged weepers (like ""Questioningly"" or ""Needles and Pins"") that the Ramones used to toss out to catch you off guard. As its title windily suggests, ""How Can a Man With So Many Friends Feel So Alone"" also bears a somewhat melancholy cast, even as the guitars quote Messrs. Page and Richards at their cockiest. Another influence poking through the song is mid-to-late-90s Beck, back when the stereopathic Scientologist was expertly fusing country, blues, and funk to his own cracked-glass worldview. In fact, the wisecracking sex jams of 1999's <em>Midnite Vultures</em><em> </em>serve as a pretty good reference point for several of the decidedly non-serious scuzz-rockers here, especially ""High Voltage"", with its invocations of ""getting freaky in the shadows of the night time.""</p>
<p>Of course, whereas Beck preferred cobbling together his surrealistic quips from pop-culture allusions, Eagles of Death Metal have seemingly never met a dumb pun or double entendre they could resist (in case the album title didn't tip you off). But rather than coming off as smarmily ironic or just plain braindead, the cheap jokes align nicely with the band's entire cheeseball fuck-mook shtick. The James Brown homage ""(I Used to Couldn't Dance) Tight Pants"" and modestly punny ""Cheap Thrills"" (complete with bored female vocals and references to ""spending"" time) are fine, but neither compares to the retarded majesty of ""Solo Flights"". Rock's annals are rife with infamous odes to whacking off, but few have ever been as gleefully pleased with it as this one,¬†<em></em>thanks to assertions like ""nobody does me like I do."" To be honest, it's not a bad metaphor for the entire project, which amounts to an exercise in self-gratification that's nonetheless thoroughly entertaining for how much care and enjoyment is put into the act.</p></div>"|12388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12388-heart-on/|7.4|Joshua Love

The band made that stylistic shift house-ward just in time to give the likes of Hot Chip and Simian Mobile Disco a heads-up on where nu-rave came from. For a while, though, there was still one thing that separated the Rapture from the dance-rock acolytes that cropped up in their wake: a stylistic mission statement thinly disguised as a mix CD.</p><p><em>Tapes </em>changes that, but to what effect? It's one thing to throw a bunch of songs together and show everyone what kind of cool stuff you've been spinning lately-- especially if it's a potential harbinger of what kind of ingredients might be going into a forthcoming album. And there's enough to get the modern club-music eclectic a bit geeked just looking over the tracklist: classic roller-boogie funk from the Bar-Kays and Vaughan Mason, vintage and revival disco, and a whole fistful of acts that hit all kinds of different points on the continuum between house and electro. It's a fine blend of the obvious (Paul Johnson's massive 1999 house hit ""Get Get Down""; Ghostface Killah's perennial ""Daytona 500""), the obscure (Richie Havens' discofied take on Lamont Dozier's ""Going Back to My Roots""; Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band's campy big-band homage to Irving Berlin's ""I'm an Indian Too"") and the current (Syclops' agitated retro-Detroit electro ""Where's Jason's K"" and DJ Mujava's house jam ""Township Funk"").</p><p>Still, there's a difference between being a tastemaker with a great record collection and being a straight-up momentum-building DJ, and if you value slow builds and subtle transitions you might find yourself getting a bit antsy. The first half of <em>Tapes </em>is thrown together in a slapdash manner that leaves grooves too restless and transitions too jarring: The intro is 32 amputated seconds of the Undisputed Truth's ""Earthquake Shake"" cut abruptly into ""Daytona 500"", and the Ghostface track's attempted mix into the Junkyard Band's anti-Reagan classic ""The Word""-- from a straightforward funk-fusion break into the tumbling, rolling syncopation of the archetypal go-go beat-- feels like taking an Aston Martin off-road. And that aforementioned roller-boogie two-fer of ""Holy Ghost"" and ""Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll"" <em>should </em>work, but the inexplicable half-assed fade into $20-boom-box tinniness at the end of the Bar-Kays track just before the segue isn't the smoothest way to move into couples' skate.</p>
<p>Fortunately, not all of the mix is as jarring-- Martin Circus' 1979 Franco-cheese ""Disco Circus"" shakes hands well with Arcade Lover's sleek nu-Chic ""Fantasy Lines""-- and if you aren't too bothered by the seams, you'll eventually find that the second half of <em>Tapes </em>is packed tight with great recent tracks. Along with the Syclops and DJ Mujava cuts, there's Kiloo &amp; Phonique's icy-hot deep house ""The Passion"", the Donk Boys' rubber-kneed ""Cpstyre"", and the room-filling ghettotech-electro of Dances With White Girls' ""Everybody's Got to Make a Living"", which boasts a kidney-punch level of bass and makes great use of the vocal hook from the 20th Century Steel Band's ""Heaven &amp; Hell Is on Earth"". This mix might not<span> help the Rapture pass every test of the best club DJs, but when it comes to maybe the most important one</span>-- <span>the ability to make clubbers push their way to the booth and breathlessly ask for the title of that amazing cut they just dropped</span>-- <span>they</span>'<span>ve done their studying.</span></p></div>"|12384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12384-tapes/|6.6|Nate Patrin

British-born singer and songwriter Essie Jain doesn't sound much like Baez-- she's not a folk singer, exactly, and her voice is often deep and direct where Baez's is light and warbly-- but her second LP, <em>The Inbetween</em>, is heavy with the same odd, pervasive uneasiness. From the nervous, scuttling piano notes which open ""Here We Go"" through the fog-horn desolation of the extra-grim ""I Remember It Just Like This"", <em>The Inbetween</em> is quiet and desperate, a trembling testament to general disillusionment. <br/><br/>Jain's minimal compositions-- most tracks feature only vocals and piano or acoustic guitar-- are dark and distrustful (""There is not an innocent man around us who isn't under siege,"" she bellows in ""Please"") and tinged with an otherworldliness that earns her comparisons to freak-folkers past and present-- especially Vashti Bunyan, Sandy Denny, and White Magic's Mira Billotte. The cinematic bleakness of <em>The Inbetween</em> can be wearying, but it's also the record's central conceit; its atmospherics are at least as essential as its songs. Consequently, <em>The Inbetween</em> becomes the kind of record that leaves its listeners craving melodramatic context (walking despondently down a mysterious alley, fedora deflecting light rain, face obscured)-- anything more distinctive and tortured than just slouching over on a living room couch. <br/><br/>Jain had a track (""Why"") included on the Slim Moon-curated <em>The Sound the Hare Heard</em> (alongside a slew of singer-songwriters, including Death Vessel, Sufjan Stevens, Thao Nguyen, Wooden Wand, and Laura Veirs), and her ghostly 2007 debut, <em>We Made This Ourselves</em>, placed her squarely within the new spook-folk paradigm. All of Jain's work is focused, mostly, on her lingering voice: It can be deep and prodding or high and vaporous, depending on the moment. ""Do It"", one of the richer tracks on the record (it includes piano, guitar, and drums), is also one of the strongest-- Jain's vocals, raw and uncorrected, nudge and jab.

This anachronistically mop-topped, blouse-and-kimono-sporting former member of jack-of-all-Can-assed-trades Super Numeri remains sort of an answer to the pointless late-night rock-crit stoner query, ""Dude, what if Devendra Banhart were Liverpudlian?""<br/><br/>Of course, Levi now resides in Los Angeles, which seems to have added a veneer of clubby bouyance and an obsession with sophisticated superficiality to his previously merely Brit-gazing glam/retro arsenal. This album's three visits to his debut's old vamping grounds--""Wannamama"", ""Fire on Your Feet"", and ""Oh God (What Can I Do?)""--don't much outshine similar homages by fellow T. Rex-urrectors such as Wolfmother, Bobby Conn, Living Things, et al<em>.</em> I mean, you'd likely keep dancing if a deejay dropped ""Oh God"" right after ""Suffragette City""-- until its chorus-eats-itself finale, which probably aims for deconstruction but just sounds like the disc is skipping. But poor ""Fire on Your Feet"" commits the same peculiar sin as a whole suite of tracks from 2007's <em>The Return to Form Black Magick Party</em>: Its arrangement is oddly suggestive of ""Indian Reservation"", 1971's infamous P'ul Revere &amp; the Raiders-in-Cherokee-drag smash.<br/><br/>The majority of this platter, however, concerns itself with a bizarrely/proudly quote-unquote inauthentic experiment with 80s textures. Recorded at the same Westlake studio in which Quincy Jones concocted <em>Thriller, </em>at least seven tracks blend dorky/dated keyboard settings, bullyingly fey vocals, vapid lyrics, tricky time signatures, and all the urgency of cruise-ship reggae. Listeners are left wondering if they‚Äôve just gorged on an Anglo response to J-pop, a post (white-)boy-band attempt to alley-oop new jack swing, or the work of a Scissor Sister gone solo.<br/><br/>A trio of ballads soften the record‚Äôs grab-bag attack. ""Semi-Babe"" laments a lover whose Caller ID seems conspicuously overpopulated, kicking off <em>Never</em>‚Äôs preoccupation with the surveillance possibilities enabled by networks and networking sites (as well as incriminatingly begging the question of why the speaker is invading the semi-babe's privacy). ""You Don't Gotta Run"", meanwhile, is a senseless, luscious confection. ""Calling Me Down"", though, plays like Todd Rundgren pretending to have a ""womb"" in which to keep the grief his troublesome ladyfriend keeps on a-causing.<br/><br/>Levi has stated of his intentions with this album that he ""wanted to have a kind of soullessness so it's almost like some kind of anti-soul."" To which I must respond: job well done. I've never encountered, in my 10 years of professional CD reviewership, an album so plastic in its references to New Edition, Sparks, and T-Pain that it would fit perfectly between mid-career Ween albums <em>Pure Guava</em> and <em>Chocolate and Cheese. </em>Levi is that secretly assidious studio rat who wants his labor to look minimal. So: Here's a willfully slight set of accomplished compositions just as full of hooks as the first <em>Hellraiser</em> film, which might, sadly, hold more appeal in twenty years, when played on ""ancient"" vinyl during a truce-night in some volatile couple's back-looking apartment. Never, never love, indeed.</p></div>"|12383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12383-never-never-love/|6.0|William Bowers

When Farina is at his best he can paint an evocative picture with a minimum of strokes, either a few pointed lyrical abstractions or a handful of strums and plucks. Unfortunately, he's often erred on the side of excess, going overboard with his guitar heroics or wordplay and turning seemingly pleasant or interesting tunes into loveless labors. This familiar turn occurs much too often on Glorytellers' intermittently enjoyable full-length debut.<br/><br/>The story goes that Farina wrote most of the album's songs on a beat-up flamenco guitar while ensconced in a secluded cabin in the mountains of northern Italy. It might seem like a set-up that's too good to be true, but <em>Glorytellers</em> shines brightest when it comes closest to realizing that idyllic scene. ""Trovato Suono"" (Italian for ""Found Sound"") does this the best of all the album's tracks. It combines flamenco strumming and brushed drums with unobtrusive plugged-in flourishes, and Farina, in his indomitable affect-free voice, gracefully offers some phrases to abet the whimsical worries (""Head feels like a satellite/ Dark side of the earth tonight"") at the root of his lyric. The tracks that lean on evocative images of nature also tap into this earthy simplicity, whether they be the slightly overwrought similes of ""Exclusive Hurricanes"" (""You are like the tree/ That spreads out all its seed"") or the decidedly wintery backdrop behind album closer ""Perennials"". The unfussy arrangements that accompany these tracks help enhance that charm.<br/><br/>""Tears Of..."" seems to be a similar slice of breezy prettiness, with its gentle arpeggios and lazy gallop, but semi-topical lines like ""infidels stare at you longest straight in the eye"" and ""tell the 30-odd-million what their tears are made of"" belie the track's relaxed demeanor and reveal the song to be an effective, if diffuse, polemic. Other attempts to speak hard-hitting poetic truths, however, aren't nearly as successful. The fractured family portrait sketched out in ""Camouflage"" comes off as over-written and overly emotive, and is also weighed down with intrusive spasms of electric guitar noodling.<br/><br/>A few tracks-- specifically ""Quarantine"" and ""Anonymous""-- are so overloaded with words that Farina ends up cramming too much into too small a space, an arrangement that's unflattering to both the tales he's trying to tell and the voice giving them life. The tunes behind these words don't help matters-- the music in ""Quarantine"" is as harried and frantic as the lyric it's chasing, and the jazz-guitar licks that show up on ""Anonymous"" are anything but hot. The one place this approach comes closest to succeeding is in ""Awake at the Wheel"", where the non-stop rush of words and images are used in the service of a band-tour story that's seemingly about running across the still-fresh site of a roadside murder. Unfortunately, the abstraction of the actual events occurring in the song doesn't mesh with the specificity of the mentioned details, and the meandering shamble of a tune underneath it all clashes with the material. One or two missteps like this, where reach exceeds grasp and passion overwhelms prudence, are understandable if not commendable. The problem with <em>Glorytellers</em> is that the modest moments where song and story work together and co-exist peacefully are in short supply.</p></div>"|12366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12366-glorytellers/|5.1|David Raposa

Lead singer Gary Lightbody's lyrics may have been more wince-inducing than watching Sarah Palin go off script, yet none of it mattered when the band reached choruses so unabashedly large and humane.</p><p>Though wide-screen preciousness is Snow Patrol's forte, that's no reason to expect Lightbody and co. to continue bleating towards the stars forever. Arena-sized anthemics have already taken the group to commercial heights scarcely imaginable when the formerly monikered Polar Bear were indie-pop nobodies on Jeepster, lost in Belle and Sebastian's shadow. The band's newest album, <em>A Hundred Million Suns</em>, doesn't represent any drastic shift in its sonic principles, yet it's noticeably lighter on surging, megawatt stadium-filling fare. Perhaps the newfound attention paid to nuance is just a sign of Snow Patrol's maturing, but in the record's puzzlingly diminished returns it's not hard to hear a band seemingly upping the degree of difficulty when it was just barely getting by in the first place.</p><p>If <em>A Hundred Million Suns</em> has any hits in it at all, they're likely over and done in the album's first eight minutes. Opener ""If There's a Rocket Tie Me to It"" is Snow Patrol at their best and most emblematic, as Lightbody softens the blow of overwrought lyrics like ""the sea between us only amplifies the sound waves"" with his reliably irresistible Scottish burr, while the band crashes and explodes at his back. Second track ""Crack the Shutters"" also goes in the win column, regardless (or perhaps because) of its modest ambitions. Rhapsodizing about waking up in the morning next to a lover and wanting ""to bathe you in the light of day"" may be a fairly douche-y sentiment, but keeping his lyrical concerns at such an intimate level nonetheless serves Lightbody far better than the awkward cosmic strivings that color much of the rest of the album.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there are groaners aplenty sprinkled throughout Lightbody's lyrics, three of the most cringe-worthy being: ""There's no truth at all/ Poking out at the giant eyes of ancient gods"" (from ""Lifeboats""); ""When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills"" (""Set Down Your Glass""); and ""the shells crack under our shoes like punctuation points"" (""The Planets Bend Between Us""). There's also loads of bad planetary metaphors and overwrought cosmological bullshit that proves oh-so-germane to the album's title.</p>
<p>Still, Lightbody's tin ear wasn't such a sticking point so long as Snow Patrol routinely rolled out choruses that caught your heart in your throat. Here instead we're treated to the lightly arrhythmic Radiohead-ish patter of ""The Golden Floor"", the numbingly simple acoustic patterns of ""Set Down Your Glass"", as well as the likes of ""Take Back the City"" and ""Engines"", which elicit initial optimism by the sheer fact of their volume only to eschew the band's patented emotive dynamics in favor of attempting to do something Snow Patrol just simply can't manage-- strut.</p>
<p><em>A Hundred Million Suns</em> is rife with the sense of a band striving to be taken more seriously, whether through rocking more manfully, displaying a more sophisticated subtlety, or simply stringing together three ponderous, already-overlong songs and calling the impenetrable result a 16-minute stand-alone epic (""The Lightning Strike""). Snow Patrol shouldn't be expected to manufacture mass-appeal pop-rock forever, but the fact remains that the group's talents aren't yet on par with these newer, more artful ambitions.</p></div>"|12389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12389-a-hundred-million-suns/|4.9|Joshua Love

After all, Ripatti had a strong 2007 with excellent releases as Uusitalo (propulsive tech-house) and Vladislav Delay (swirling fractal dub). By comparison, it appeared that Ripatti had exhausted the possibilities inherent to the Luomo project, and that every new release was doomed to intensify a sense of diminishing returns.¬† <br/><br/>In retrospect, <em>Paper Tigers</em> sounds better than I remember: a stately, hypnotic collection featuring some of Ripatti's most refined house productions. But it exists almost entirely within the shadow of the first two Luomo albums, inviting the warmth of recognition rather than the flushes and chills of surprised fascination. Ripatti's work as Vladislav Delay hardly shocks these days either, but there's a sense with Luomo that the stakes are higher. Standing still is anathema to the Luomo aesthetic, the value of which resides not merely in the bewitching, spangly depths of Ripatti's arrangements, but also in the vague sense that, at his best, he forges new emotional as well as sonic territory, marshalling enormous amounts of studio wizardry and compositional effort to map out a new (effortless-sounding) textural and sensual approach to house music.</p><p>So it's with a sense of relief bordering on exhilaration that I come to the fourth Luomo album to discover a substantial rewiring of this particular aesthetic. While retaining the voluptuous shimmer characteristic of all Ripatti's work as Luomo, this album distances itself from the stutters and glitches he previously used to imply conflict and self-contradiction (puncturing house's habitual self-assurance). Instead, <em>Convivial</em> parades an immaculately structured, insectile busyness: clean and clearly etched, each sound placed with infinite care and burnished to a hyperreal sheen. If <em>Vocalcity</em> was murky and enveloping and <em>The Present Lover</em> gaseous and giddy, then <em>Convivial</em> is more like the rush of pure oxygen, offering a sound that is so sharp and so vivid it sears as much as it energizes.¬† <br/><br/>It's also Ripatti's most unabashed foray into ""pop"" territory. Where previously the producer mostly oscillated between simple refrains and rigorously fractured vocal cut-ups (occasionally leaving his anonymous divas to wander in a confusing hall of mirrors), <em>Convivial</em> ushers in an array of guest vocalists whose contributions resemble (to a greater or lesser extent) ""proper songs,"" filled with the coherent emotional arcs of complete verses and choruses.¬† <br/><br/>""Love You All"", a brooding gothic electro-ballad somewhere between the first Junior Boys album and Depeche Mode's <em>Violator</em>, forms a far outpost into this unfamiliar territory, its stuttering groove, morose strings, and eerie arpeggios creating a dense, almost claustrophobic topographic framework for Sascha Ring (Apparat)'s languid-but-tense verses and overblown falsetto choruses. It's a world away from the open-ended, near-formless echo-chambers of <em>Vocalcity</em>, or even the expansive curving surfaces of <em>The Present Lover</em>; compared to those albums, its exacting subordination of sonics to songfulness seems almost totalitarian.¬† <br/><br/>But it's precisely this sense of discipline that makes ""Love You All"" (together with <em>Convivial</em>'s other highlights) so marvelous: The pressure that these full-blown song structures exert upon Ripatti's sonic largess creates an unbearable sense of momentum that makes the best tracks here almost explosive with a joyful sense of possibility. You can almost hear the delight with which Ripatti puzzles out how to imbue the transitions from verses to choruses on ""Love You All"" with the kind of anthemic surge that pop masters take for granted. And it is from within this process of symbiotic adaptation-- the careful entwining of the producer's trembling sounds along the snaking contours of songcraft-- that the hoped-for sense of emotional breakthrough emerges. <br/><br/>The (relatively) weaker moments on <em>Convivial</em> are those which could most easily be mistaken for a reiteration the sound of the previous Luomo albums: On the understated chug of ""If I Can't"", (Scissor Sister) Jake Shears' bittersweet multi-tracked sighs mirror a little too closely the conflicted, stuttering divas of old, a resemblance Ripatti underlines by providing some of his most archetypal bruised, woozy synth chords. But even here, there's a sense of economy and structure that lifts the song above its immediate forbears, with every synth quiver and scraping dub echo carefully sustaining the ambiguous development of Shears' performance.¬† <br/><br/>But while it's pleasing to see Ripatti further hone his familiar sound, I can't help but prefer the alchemy of the new: The best moments on <em>Convivial</em> transpose that unmistakable air of aching longing onto a broader, less predictable sonic palette. ""Gets Along Fine"" might ride a familiar wistful bass riff, but the core of its appeal resides in the astonishing combination of bleeping synthesizer and pseudo-African percussion in its chorus, which makes it simultaneously the most aggressive and purely joyous Luomo production to date, the muscular assault of its universalist affection like an embrace so fierce it crushes. The marvel, and perhaps the necessity of the Luomo project, is bound up in the shock of physical intimacy; pleasurable, overwhelming, and at times a little scary. ""Am I really feeling this?"" ""Is it you who is making me feel this way?"" Yes, and yes.</p></div>"|12390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12390-convivial/|8.5|Tim Finney

A little on the late side, he instead recorded for his girlfriend the lion's share of the lap-pop serenade, <em>Chunk of Change</em>. Friends were excited by what they heard, a band was born, a record deal signed.<br/><br/>Defined as much by its lyrical prism and Angelakos' falsetto (more on that later) as its gooey textures, <em>Chunk of Change</em> walks the line between beat-driven, Hot Chip floor geeking and twee atmospherics. And while he gave his band the name of a 1980s skin flick, Angelakos' production mirrors the more cuddly bent that sparked the project: synths are Downy-soft, blankets of melodic skin that expand alongside their oversized choruses. More significantly, it suggests a certain level of un-self-conscious pop versatility. You can gyrate. You can navelgaze. You can shiver. You can cringe.<br/><br/>It's a sonic ethos that fits much of Angelakos' lyrical Lloyd Dobler-ing well. Opener ""I've Got Your Number"" is a clear standout, its synthetic handclaps and high frequency whirring offer a prime framework for introducing the dude's voice and poetry. Depending on your emotional constitution or complexion, the latter can be, understandably, something of a turn-off. As is the case with the less propulsive material here, most time is spent nose-to-nose with turns like ""Have you seen me cry tears like diamonds? Down and down they fly, faster and faster,"" or ""Whatever happens to you, whatever happens to me, I hope that I'll fall asleep knowing that you'll always be the story with no ending."" But you can't fault a guy for loving someone his way. Given the notion that Angelakos initially expected just one person to really listen, the record benefits heavily from that which a lot of us look for in sound or elsewhere: emotional authenticity.<br/><br/>If anything, the EP's major flaw is also a gamebreaker. Angelakos' falsetto flirts dangerously with histrionics at times, the breathy swings of ""Cuddle Fuddle"" or forgettable disco-pop of ""Better Things"" are two examples of his pipes at their most distracting. He can veer way off course for sure, but when matching the movement and mood of his own textures, his exuberance can be narcotic. ""Sleepyhead"" is the one addition not included on the original mixtape and it hints at savvier, more muscular vibrations coming down the pipeline (a full-length is slated for early 2009). Also the EP's shortest and most infectious moment, it's a tipsy, bass-heavy Cristal bath with the likes of Mannheim Steamroller and Ginuwine. I think it's about a girl.</p></div>"|12379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12379-chunk-of-change-ep/|7.9|David Bevan

They make groove-based music, but those grooves are patient, at times exceedingly subtle. They're indie, but of the diffident sort that pairs Fay Davis-Jeffers' dispassionate, nearly na√Øve-sounding vocals with bony, bookish rhythms. It's not that they have anything to be embarassed about: The record sees them incorporating, largely successfully, all manner of exotic-sounding, museum-quality instrumentation into their repertoire, and doing it the only way they know how-- quietly. In terms of their Chicago predecessors and contemporaries, the new Pit Er Pat approximates Tortoise's rhythm-centered experiments while mostly avoiding their overthinking tendencies, suggests the deceptively complicated melodic structures of tourmates Fiery Furnaces, and at points echoes Mahjongg's frenzied, rhythmic whirl.</p><p>Mostly, though, Pit Er Pat are fine with quiet tinkering, and much of <em>High Time</em> reflects the playful experimental legacy of dub reggae; most obviously on ""Evacuation Days"", in the way the reedy guitar weaves in and out of the bottomless bass, dodging random sound effects (like a Brazilian cu√≠ca, most recognizable from Beck's ""Tropicalia"") like renegade cab drivers. Or that maniacal laugh on ""Copper Pennies""-- sped up and tweaked so that it resembles a speed-addled chimp-- that matches the song's eerie funk, redolent of the pungent, gloomy Euro-fusion Can perfected on <em>Ege Bamyasi </em>and <em>Tago Mago</em>. ""Trod-A-Long"" pulls the band as far out of its shell as it's ever been, with playful organ licks, drawn out horn lines, melodica-derived ambience, and laser sound effects coalescing into a piece that suggests it should have its own dance to accompany it.</p><p>The hieroglyphically-titled opening track ""‚òâ In ‚ôë : ‚òΩ in ‚ôà : Anno IVxx"" asserts that <em>High Time</em>'s occasional bouts of playfulness are still cloaked in mystery. ""Anno""'s vocal consists of nothing but chanted numbers, as if the song held an embedded code to decipher. Well, I've deciphered it, and it turns out that ""IV"" means ""4"", and ""xx"" means ""20"", and <a href=""http://www.ivxx.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>the URL is already taken</strong></a>, bros. Pit er Pat may be telling us they're stoners (that would explain the dub), but a track like ""Omen"" suggests that they're not the Brightblack Morning Light, hippie variety. As melancholy brass rises and falls like foghorns signaling a funeral at sea, Davis-Jeffers intimates that the album's title isn't suggesting the magazine that celebrates sticky hydro, but the ultimate buzzkill. ""Push me, push me under, where the cold river flows"" tells us it's ""high time"" for either an underwater burial or the creepiest-ever baptism. Despite the band's significant steps forward, <em>High Time</em> isn't a complete rebirth for Pit Er Pat, but the record shows that in their own way, they can learn and perform a more extroverted language.</p></div>"|12373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12373-high-time/|7.0|Eric Harvey

Drummer Curran Reynolds doesn't hit as hard as John Bonham, but he has a similar knack for groove and beat selection. Cleave Jimmy Page's double-necked axe in two, and you get guitarists Garett Bussanick and Greg Kramer. Shave Robert Plant's head, firm up his abs, and make him a black man: Gene Fowler. Then, mix in 1990s noise rock-- Fowler's yelp is a lot like David Yow's-- and the outr√© dissonance of early Voivod. <br/>¬†<br/>But the similarities are not only cosmetic. Like Zeppelin, Wetnurse are fond of acoustic guitar. <em>Invisible City</em> opens and closes with acoustic picking, and ""Life at Stake"" has strumming straight out of <em>Led Zeppelin III</em>. But, unlike Led Zeppelin, these acoustic bits aren't full songs. They're Wes Anderson-esque interludes that help underscore just how weird this record is. From the unbecoming name to the curiously bland artwork to the almost complete omission of printed lyrics, it's hard to penetrate Wetnurse. <br/>¬†<br/>Yet their twists and turns invariably lead to anthemic climaxes that, again, recall Zeppelin. ""Life at Stake"" deliciously pits major-key licks against minor-key riffs; the pull-offs of the former are pure ""Over the Hills and Far Away"". The descending chords in ""Sacred Peel"" recast ""Kashmir"" as proggy metalcore. Dinosaur rock also crops up in ""Slow Your Spell, Miss Hell"", albeit under the glowing arc lights of Chavez. Other memorable surprises include the Helmet riff snuck into ""Not Your Choice"" and the startlingly operatic diva that crowns ""Missing Lion Returns"". <br/>¬†<br/>Such unpredictability is both titillating and tiring. Wetnurse have an endless supply of catchy riffs, but they deploy them all instead of letting any sink in. Martin Bisi's recording feels dull; the guitars roar, but the drums merely punch where they should crack. Wetnurse's off-kilter attack works better live. There, their rapid-fire succession of riffs feels like fireworks at close range. They're punk, they're metal, they're classic rock; they're the ""all of the above"" that makes New York City frustratingly wonderful.</p></div>"|12362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12362-invisible-city/|7.6|Cosmo Lee

In fact, collections that emerged during the band's lifetime, like <em>Louder Than Bombs </em>and <em>Hatful of Hollow</em>, are more or less part of the group's canon. So while it's slightly baffling that a really good one-volume introduction hasn't appeared yet, it's not exactly frustrating. Does this release do the job? The first disc is fine, containing most of the band's singles and a few key album tracks. The second is messier: Halfway between a rarities collection and a deeper investigation of the group's work, it doesn't satisfy on either level. B-Side mavens will wonder where minor tracks like ""I Keep Mine Hidden"" are, while new fans hoping to hear a band at their peak won't bother coming back to pleasant spacefillers like ""Oscillate Wildly"". And with each disc sequenced chronologically, <em>The Sound...</em> ends up telling the same story twice.<br/><br/>The story in question is one of the oldest of all: When you've built your art around loneliness and exclusion, what do you do once you find a mass audience? The Smiths' career halves into a kitchen-sink era and a vaudeville one-- in the former, the lives Morrissey sings about are greyer and more limited, the action more realistic, the frustrations rawer. In the latter, kicked off by the music-hall intro to ""The Queen Is Dead"", the misery is exaggerated into archness, the loneliness played more for laughs. The divide isn't absolute-- second single ""This Charming Man"" is as wry and sprightly a record as they ever made; latterday B-Side ""Asleep"" as dark a one. But in general, the early Smiths are a starker proposition: There's a gulf between the band who made 1983's keening ""Jeane"" (""How can you call this a home/ When you know it's a grave"") and the band on 1987's jaunty, frivolous ""Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before"". <br/><br/>That's not to say the group got worse. Morrissey's great contribution to pop is a mode of flamboyant loneliness, and it took a while for that to evolve and peak. My favorite Smiths period is the batch of singles around <em>The Queen Is Dead</em>-- the singer in thrillingly confident form, slipping nimbly between the roles of martyr (""Bigmouth Strikes Again""), spokesperson (""The Boy With the Thorn in His Side""), doomsayer (""Panic""), and kindly advisor (""Ask""). The point of the Smiths isn't that their songs were miserable or that their fans were alienated, it's that they showed how to turn the misery into a weapon, a rebellion, a strength, a pose. In this their wildly successful inheritors have been mall-emo teen idols like Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance, bands who've blazed a Morrisseyesque trail into a more traditionally pop demographic. <br/><br/>There are two big problems with performing misery, though. First, it's easy for it to set into self-parody. By the time the group split, singles like ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" were setting these alarm bells off-- frothy, fun, but nowhere near as striking as the band's best work. Secondly, it really helps if you have the star power and natural charisma of Morrissey: Bands with less of a frontman could find themselves in a trap, glamorizing a loneliness they could have fought. ¬†<br/><br/>Your reaction to the Morrissey cult of personality is still likely to determine your reaction to the band as a whole-- grotesquely unfair on guitarist Johnny Marr though that is. It's thanks to him that everything the Smiths did is worth hearing, even when his lyricist is having an off day. His range and ambition as a composer widened through the band's life, and his contributions remained consistently stellar-- from the liquid joy of ""This Charming Man""'s giddy intro to the mock-stately chill of his picking on ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"". His iconic, shuddering phased guitar riffs on ""How Soon Is Now?"" are the reason that track remains the band's best known. <br/><br/>Listening to<em> The Sound of the Smiths</em>-- a project overseen by the singer and guitarist-- though, it's Morrissey who still makes an impact. There remains the cold-water shock of their early records-- the rainswept romanticism of ""Hand in Glove"", the double-bluffing whimsy of ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"", and the heartbroken empathy of ""William, It Was Really Nothing"", perhaps their saddest song of all. More than anything, the compilation rehabilitates the band's anger. From ""Still Ill"" through ""Nowhere Fast"" to ""Panic"" the record is full of manifestos, masked by bravado or comedy but with a thread of bloody-minded rage running through them nonetheless. When Morrissey finds a specific target, it results in the band's fiercest music: ""The Headmaster Ritual"" is a thrillingly venomous treat, but Morrissey's agonized howls of ""No, no no!"" on a live ""Meat Is Murder"" are as uncomfortable as intended. If you sympathize, you might find it cathartic; if not, you might think it over-the-top-- a miniature of reaction to the group in general. <br/><br/>Morrissey's gestures of refusal aren't especially principled, or philosophical-- they seem to come from a more primal, contrary place: an instinctive comic repulsion towards modernity and its trimmings, a cackle of despair at a world getting shabbier by the day. A very English impulse, this, flailing at a weakening country-- though he emerged in an era where even comfortable conservatism was being shredded, Morrissey is really a piece from an earlier jigsaw puzzle. As their sepiatoned singles sleeves hinted, the Smiths are the pop band England had failed to produce in the late 1950s when the post-war generation was making a spiteful mark on every other artisitc discipline-- poetry, theatre, film, literature. Better late than never.</p></div>"|12385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12385-the-sound-of-the-smiths/|7.5|Tom Ewing

That's what Mavis Staples-- a longtime social justice warrior who marched alongside Martin Luther King, Jr., and soundtracked, with her Staples siblings and father Pops, the civil rights movement-- would likely tell you. Releasing a live album of freedom songs on this election day is a deliberate gesture, but maybe a more nuanced one than people might expect. Staples (like a lot of us), may fervently hope for an Obama win and would probably be the first to enumerate the items remaining on the civil-rights task list, but the gospel/R&amp;B/pop legend has always favored King's peaceful progressive-Christian theology that privileges the ""good news"" over the agitating, even when good news is scant and there's plenty to agitate about. <br/><br/>Sounding like a charismatic preacher, Staples frames her performance for the audience, ""We've come here tonight to bring you some joy, some happiness, inspiration, and some positive vibrations! We want to leave you with enough to last you for maybe the next six months"". The crowd that converged on Chicago's cozy, laid-back Hideout this past June are enthused, but polite (and probably a bit awestruck), as she launches with gusto into protest-era standard ""Eyes on the Prize"". For its well-mannered, highly expectant air, it could be an Obama rally. <br/><br/>Subdued audience aside, Staples-- even at 69-- is a geyser of ferocity and depth. Her voice gets a little grizzly performing ""Wade in the Water"" in the sub-basement of her (already low) natural range, and she requests crowd participation to bolster her understandably weary pipes on finale ""I'll Take You There"", but her energy is gobsmacking. Following a raucous rendition of ""Freedom Highway"", which the three-piece band plays as a runaway bus on a rural road, culminating in much cymbal smashing and jubilant howls, Staples apologizes, ""I get so all up into it. You know, when the spirit hits you, you've got to move!""¬† <br/><br/>But Staples is no saint. In contrast to her demure, choir-backed performance on 2007's superlative studio album <em>We</em>'<em>ll Never Turn Back</em>, she sounds lusty and provocative over ""This Little Light""'s scruffy guitar riffs, veering often in the same phrase between outrage and ""joy-- joy, joy, joy!"" ""Light"" and blues moaner ""Down in Mississippi"" support-- like most great R&amp;B-- he tenet that the sacred and secular, spiritual and carnal aren't mutually exclusive, and that passion is passion whether exercised as faith, anger, love or lust. Considering that these days Staples' fans probably include just as many of the godless as the church-going, her knack for translating religious experience makes her music ecumenical and inclusive unlike, for example, much contemporary Christian rock. That said, probably the most overtly religious number on her setlist, ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"", a traditional song closely associated with the Carter Family-- and the first Pops taught his Staples brood to perform-- receives the Hideout audience's warmest embrace.<br/><br/>Throughout the performance, Staples' band and trio of backup singers are ideal support players-- tight, professional, and mostly unobtrusive, never threatening to upstage Staples the way some of Ry Cooder's (admittedly spectacular) <em>Never Turn Back</em> production fireworks do. Of course, Staples has never been one of those velvet roped-off divas. If <em>Live: Hope at the Hideout</em> captures something her studio work doesn't, it's her approachability, her genuine audience rapport. Like all the great politicians, Mavis Staples has a gift for the common touch.</p></div>"|12387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12387-live-hope-at-the-hideout/|7.6|Amy Granzin

Matthew Gerken, Christian Kiefer, and Jefferson Pitcher write songs for each of the 43 U.S. presidents. Tomorrow, of course, marks the symbolic end of an interminable election cycle that began in earnest with Barack Obama and John McCain's speeches at their parties' 2004 conventions, and has since permeated all corners of American life. Indie rockdom itself is more than ripe for this sort of endeavor, in which the civic-minded children's theatre of Sufjan Stevens' <em>Illinois</em> is blended with currently popular sounds of sepia-toned Americana. Obama announced his candidacy in Lincoln's hometown, while McCain compared him to Herbert Hoover: If there were a time for a folk song about Benjamin Harrison and the tariff flap, it's now. More importantly is what this collection represents: When the electorate is seemingly more engaged with battleground states than, well, <em>real-life</em> battlegrounds, it's important to consider, as <em>Of Great and Mortal Men</em> does, that the dominant narratives we're given are woefully incomplete stories.<br><br>Though it goes against every fiber of my critical being, I have to award this project significant points for effort. It took shape as Gerken, Kiefer, and Pitcher's effort to write 14 songs in 28 days for the fawm.org website, and quickly expanded to writing 42 songs during February 2006, saving our current leader for last, and with the promise of a new song for tomorrow's victor (we'll hope there's not a line about the Supreme Court or whatever Diebold is calling itself these days). The trio brought in dozens of collaborators to flesh out the demos, and the collection's most recommendable trait is its variety of tone-- from the post-rock muscle of the James K. Polk entry (assisted by Austin band Monahans), to the shaggy Crazy Horse riffing on the second Grover Cleveland piece, which follows the banjo-folk first effort. Rosie Thomas lends a jazz-inspired vocal to the Jimmy Carter number ""A Great Beam of Light"", and James Jackson Toth adds sepuchral ambience to Kiefer's Lincoln portrait, on which he pulls lyrics from his two inaugural addresses and Gettysburg remarks. Indianapolis-based Standard Recording Company packaged the final set with an booklet (hardback would have been much better, but also no doubt prohibitively expensive) containing lyrics and original commissioned artwork for each President, but that's not all: There's a <strong><a href=""http://ofgreatandmortalmen.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a></strong> as well, which includes production narratives and even advice for educators seeking to use the collection in the classroom.<br><br>All this would be as worthless as a yard sign on November 5 if the music weren't good, and for the most part, it is. This isn't the Capitol Steps, folks: True to its name, <em>Of Great and Mortal Men</em> underscores the fact that even the most lionized American political icons are made of flesh and bone, subject to strange fates and prone to making massive mistakes only visible in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML2ki8xEj9c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>rearview mirrors</strong></a>. Many of these songs are imagined deathbed confessionals masking clever historical revisionism: Kiefer's George Washington, who elementary school history tells us never lied, divulges that ""those dumb asses believed me,"" while a trumpet solo by Cake's Vincent DiFiore lends a nice touch of Colonial ambience. Califone was brought in to arrange and perform Kiefer's ""Such a Marvelous Dream"", in which Ronald Reagan recalls his term in office as a movie role through the haze of dementia, and they also lend a surreal soundscape to Andrew Jackson's defense of his Native American ethnic cleansing: ""And I did it and they stood in the way of God's whole plan."" Bill Callahan's signature baritone is perfect for historical storytelling, and his performance on the John Tyler song ""In Hindsight"" is one of the collection's finest.<br><br>The music on <em>Great and Mortal</em> is solemn but never blandly reverent, and frequently detours into harrowing territory. Pitcher's approach to John Quincy Adams is as stark as his Ralph Stedman-influenced watercolor in the booklet: ""The icy water runs through the night and awaits my warm skin. Before the rising sun, I will bare all and enter the Potomac."" Magnolia Summer contributes accordion, violin, and lap-steel to the surprisingly uptempo William McKinley offering, written from the perspective of his anarchist assassin, who asserts, ""Let Emma Goldman be the judge of me."" Pitcher allows a distant voice to recite reconstituted notes from one of William Howard Taft's aides, recounting the mundane horrors of the President missing a golf outing due to contracting gout. Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart contributes eerie vocals to the collection's chilliest number, a stark post-Great War narrative seemingly written from the perspective of a veteran. New York singer-songwriter Reid Maclean gets the collection's most resonant line, written by Pitcher about bachelor James Buchanan, whose presidency ended in 1861: ""A war it will come to bury lonely me"". <br><br>The most successful works here are those that stay in an impressionistic pocket, eliding too much detail and staying off the soapbox. Gerken is the most frequent transgressor in this regard, using cited quotations like a term paper (from his Harding song: ""'An army of pompous phrases, moving across the landscape, in search of an idea,' said Bill McAdoo""), and drawing tenuous connections to the current moment, like noting that Martin Van Buren's wife was ""scrubbed from existence in an early attempt to create history simply with talking points"". It should be noted that one of the record's best moments, however, does deal with decidedly non-political material. Called ""Zinger"", Kiefer's ode to James Madison is a tongue-in-cheek, Sufjan-esque paean to First Lady Dolly, now ""known to every sticky fingered chubby from sea to shining sea.""<br><br>A bit like ""Zinger"" feels exceedingly appropriate at the current moment, as do Gerken's blog-like minor polemics. We're staring down the most important election in a generation, and are exhausted because it's also the most widely documented and thoroughly narrativized, with a film about our current president in theaters before he leaves office and voters asked to make decisions about the next leader of the free world based on hockey-coaching r√©sum√©s, the words of would-be plumbers, and a candidate's middle name. Bush II has frequently noted that his term in office will be vindicated by historians a century hence, but here's hoping that Kiefer, Pitcher, and Gerken's mini-biography figures into that story: ""We don't need the strength of the world's great minds. We'll just say we're right"". Crowdsource this: Whether the trio's final entry is about a frequently downed pilot who married rich or a skinny half-Kenyan who mines rhetorical gold is crucially, in the end, up to us.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|12386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12386-of-great-and-mortal-men-43-songs-for-43-us-presidencies/|7.6|Eric Harvey

In Petra Haden's case, you can start with her father, legendary bassist Charlie Haden, and continue with her stints in that dog., the Rentals, and the Decemberists, among other notable acts, right on through her other works (session, solo, or otherwise) including her awesomely virtuosic a cappella recreation of <em>The Who Sell Out</em>. Somewhere down the line of Haden's accomplishments was her 1999 collaboration with accordionist/ photographer Alicia J. Rose, aka Miss Murgatroid, with whom she released the overlooked and/or forgotten <em>Bella Neurox</em>, a disc of accordion, vocals, and violins tailor made for the twee, quirky, and weird. And now, nearly 10 years later, Petra Haden and Miss Murgatroid have returned in tandem with a sequel, <em>Hearts &amp; Daggers</em>.</p><p>Christine Shield's album art doesn't exactly raise expectations for the disc. It's a panoramic depiction of a sort of Children's Crusade in retreat, dejected kiddies following a trail of discarded crowns and scepters away from a burning castle, with cute little cats cuddling by their feet. It's a red flag warning that <em>Hearts &amp; Daggers</em> may basically be the musical equivalent of just that sort of notebook doodle, the soundtrack to a dramatic play put on by precocious kids that, whether by accident or intent, dips deep into the well of ancient madrigals and other Renaissance Faire fare.</p><p>Except that against all odds, the results aren't nearly as precious as that description might make them appear. For starters, Miss Murgatroid and Haden are hardly show-boaters, preferring to enlist the more understated characters of their respective chosen instruments. Both players also have a keen ear for evocative arrangements that toe the subtle line between song and curious assemblage. The way the pair approach ""Fade Away"", for example, is as equal parts shanty, pop tune, and Laurie Anderson-style minimalist deconstruction. Even if it lacks the compelling visual counterpart it so clearly demands (in the form of, say, a modern dance piece or a pretentious student film), it's still a winning composition. Besides, isn't that what imaginations are for?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, ""Baroque Lullaby"" toys seamlessly with both classical and folk idioms, a sweet audio frolic akin to such playful chamber groups as the Penguin Caf√© Orchestra but minus the barrier of aloof intellectual distance, while ""See Me See Me"" and ""Something's Wrong"" similarly straddle the difference between pop and Pops (in the orchestral sense). ""Ballad for Anne Bonney"" and ""Another Day"" show off such a firm grasp of the power of contrasting tones and complementary harmonic motifs that they further belie any lingering suspicion that <em>Hearts &amp; Daggers</em> is some sort of navel-gazing frivolity.</p>
<p>No, what makes the disc feel so special despite its relative insignificance is the seriousness with which Haden and Rose take these mini-symphonies, each of which resonates with its own distinct identity despite sharing the same (very) few ingredients. There's a simplicity and innocence at work here that smartly surmounts whimsy to achieve something harder to pin down. Essential? No. Vital? Hardly. But no doubt were you to come across the two blissfully performing at a subway stop, you'd gladly toss a few bucks into the hat and ride home happy and content with the decision as you hum to yourself a few lingering, mysterious melodies.</p></div>"|12365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12365-hearts-daggers/|7.3|Joshua Klein

The differences between 2002's <em>Millions of Brazillians</em> and their earlier work, however, was merely a matter of degrees.   Even with the inclusion of different instruments besides bass and drums (including good old-fashioned guitar) and the contributions of some fellow Chicago scenesters (including members of Tortoise, the Coctails, and Rachel's), what sounded just fine on a song-by-song basis congealed over the course of the album into the same amorphous, thundering muddle as their previous releases.  Dianogah's tracks often seemed better suited for a more traditional rock-band alignment, which did neither the songs nor the group any favors.<br/><br/>In that light, their newest album, <em>qhnnnl</em>, is a pleasant surprise.  Whether the six-year hiatus was planned or simply a matter of circumstance, it's done Dianogah's songwriting a world of good.  The album metes the group's more expected offerings-- like the obliquely titled [and, as all tracks here, uncapitalized] instrumental ""i like juice in a shark suit"" and album opener ""oneone""-- with a few well-spotted curveballs.  One early departure comes in the form of ""a breaks b"", a track that sounds like business as usual until guest vocalist Stephanie Morris steps in to duet with lead vocalist Jay Ryan, and Andrew Bird's violin adds an uplifting lilt to the chorus.<br/><br/>No doubt Bird's presence will be the draw for most consumers, and his contributions are certainly worth the price of admission (especially in the case of ""andrew jackson"", where he takes center stage).  That said, the moments where Morris adds her two cents are equally integral to the album's success.  Her understated vocals-- reminiscent of Stars' Amy Millan at times; see  ""sprinter"" for proof-- add a plaintive sweetness and much-appreciated contrast to the group's bass-heavy M.O.  In comparison, the helping hands of keyboardist Mark Greenberg (of Coctails fame) and guitarist Billy Smith (whose band, Hubcap, features Dianogah's Ryan on bass) aren't as readily noticeable.  They both contribute whoopin' and hollerin' to barn-burner ""you might go off"", though, which sounds like something Peter Prescott would gladly co-opt for the next Mission of Burma record. It's not a track one would have expected from the Dianogah of years' past, but it's a definite sign that the group has more than a few tricks up its sleeve.</p></div>"|12363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12363-qhnnnl/|7.4|David Raposa

By all accounts, the process of making a record grows more grueling and frustrating with every passing year-- leave alone the headaches of making one under a name as closely watched as the Cure's. There are administrative hassles, label dealings, producers and directions to decide on, and the personalities and egos of an entire band to manage. These things can be draining-- they can eclipse the love of making music that gets people to start bands in the first place. And most people, by the time they hit Smith's age, have reached a level of perspective and maturity where they're not about to bash their heads against walls over anything that's not really, <em>really </em>important; they're more interested in doing the work that makes them happy and comfortable.<br/><br/>This seems to be the position Smith has come to. He's described the band's last recording stint as ""the most intense and difficult three months that I have spent with other people who I thought I knew""-- three months that produced ""the most fraught album I've ever been involved in."" (Both claims that, considering the rest of this band's biography, are really saying something.) He's changed his methods accordingly. For <em>4:13 Dream</em>, the group has been reassembled as a four-piece, and optimized for a comfortable live-band feel-- filled with people Smith can happily ram through his songs with. He's also joined up with producer Keith Uddin, who's taken a no-frills ""live"" approach to the band's sound. Smith-- and the band's press agents-- say this has been invigorating, that the Cure has stripped back to an unfussy rock band in a studio, bringing out all the happy creativity that might have been hemmed in by all those headaches and difficulties. Certain buzzwords keep popping up around it all: rawness, energy, spontaneity.<br/><br/>And across the length of the six-minute opener, ""Underneath the Stars"", it's tempting to believe the hype. Uddin gives the band an immense, spacious sound-stage, with dense trails of reverb shooting out behind guitars and vocals, and the group fills it happily, sounding unclenched, loose, energetic, and elegant. The same goes double for the closer, ""It's Over"", which has the Cure sounding as convincingly frenzied as it has since parts of <em>Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me</em>.<br/><br/>A few songs in, though, I can't help but notice a problem with this. Two songs appear in a row, ""Freakshow"" and ""Sirensong"". The former is the sort of track the Cure would once have turned into something creepy or yowling, somewhere between ""Lullaby"" and ""Hot Hot Hot!!!""; the latter's a gliding romance, something like ""A Letter to Elise"" or ""One More Time"". And yet the free-wheeling, unstudious approach of this album leaves them sounding curiously similar, more or less abandoning one of the things that's made the Cure so legendary: This is a band that has always been fantastic with atmosphere, able to make single tracks stand alone as incredible aesthetic experiences of their own. This is a band that has thrived on mood and detail! But listening to <em>4:13 Dream</em> feels like something else-- it's like listening to a rangy, carefree live recording of songs that exist in much more specific forms on a record somewhere back at home. You stand in Uddin's arena enjoying that show, but the songs that pour out aren't reflecting off the crisp album tracks you loved before you arrived-- in some cases, they're reflecting off modes from the band's back catalog, prompting you to fill in details based on where you know the band might once have taken this music.<br/><br/>Before you object, let me assert that this isn't just a problem for people overly beholden to the Cure's past; there are times when it seems to be infecting the songwriting itself, which can feel as loose and blurry as the performances. Obligatory bursts of dark drama aside, this is one of the band's happier records, and it hits its peaks two-thirds of the way through, with a string of lilting pop songs. But for a ""pop"" record, a lot of tracks here seem poorly framed, even half-baked, as if Smith's ""spontaneous"" approach-- his attempts to capture the raw energy of his demos-- have kept him from putting as much attention into the organization of his songs, the flow of the parts, the clarity of the melodies, the ludicity of the lyrics, or even the firmness of the ideas behind them. Which is really something, given that Smith wrote two albums' worth of songs for this record: Is it possible he's reinvigorated his creativity by letting himself be a bit slapdash, by not focusing long enough on any one of those tracks?<br/><br/>The great saving grace, of course, is the one critics are duty-bound to mention-- the fact that even a slightly doughy Cure record, one that doesn't entirely play to the group's former strengths, still only descends to the level of a fairly good album. (If the Cure were debuting today with this record, they'd be celebrated for Smith's voice, still incredible, alone.) There are memorable songs here, from the gorgeous refrains of ""The Hungry Ghost"" to the dizzily happy ""This. Here and Now. With You""; there are times when they break out the wah pedals and whip up storms with an infectious happiness. The only problem is that the rambling approach that let Smith get these things out has kept the results from being all they might have been.</p></div>"|12380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12380-413-dream/|6.7|Nitsuh Abebe

I'm also pretty sure he mentions exchange rates in ""Prismatic Room"". And I swear that morose, deadpan voice crawling out of ""Spiral Transit""'s sonic swamp is desperately trying to communicate something about business buildings housing holy banks and manufacturing messiahs. Oh, wait: Hargett does actually sing that last bit. So obviously I'm seeking a tonic for the Global Depression ulcer gnawing my gut, anything on which to project and deflect my own fears that it's the end of the world as I know it. Lucid name aside, Crystal Stilts hold up a convenient dark glass.<br/><br/>But really, it's a mistake to get hung up on the band's lyrics-- real or imagined. In the tradition of self-titled tracks, ""Crystal Stilts"" does seem to want to say something about their origins and strategic plan. The chorus, ""We're courting dreams/ We're snorting dreams/ Distorting dreams/ Recording dreams,"" surfs waves of gnarly Pacific Coast riffage and gleeful garage organ. But you need a lyric sheet to get even that far, and like their Brooklyn cohorts in Vivian Girls (drummer Frankie Rose's former gig), Crystal Stilts invest little in discrete motifs, neat narratives, or relatable emotions, preferring instead fog-machined setpieces of non-specific mope and gloom. ""Crystal Stilts"" is, in fact, the band's sunniest song. More-typical fare is the punningly titled ""SinKing"" with its chaotic, runaway train rhythm, discordant chordage, and doomed (but also intentionally humorous, surely) cries of ""Sin king/ sinking"", or the blunt, emphatic ""Bright Night"", that scans like a paranoid midnight odyssey to an impossibly distant sunrise.<br/><br/>""Bright Night"", along with five others, appeared earlier this year in more primitive form on the band's self-titled EP, a release that probably made a stronger-- or at least, more concise-- case for Crystal Stilts' disheveled pop. <em>Alight of Night</em>, put out by the recently awakened Slumberland, enjoys a more relaxed vibe and adds a couple keepers to the band's catalogue. But its best songs-- ""Crystal Stilts"", ""Departure"" (originally ""Converging in the Quiet""), ""Shattered Shine""-- are carry-overs. And the long-player packs some less-appealing filler: ""Verdant Gaze"" and ""The City in the Sea"" perform too literal a reading of the Velvet Underground's drony numbers, with dreary results.<br/><br/>Since we're on the subject of influence, the band makes no pretense to originality. Hamish Kilgour's public benediction wasn't essential to solving the Crystal Stilts/Kiwi pop equation, and it's a pretty sure bet that <em>Psychocandy</em> bridged the temporal distance between the original girl groups and the band's utilitarian beats. Also, as much as I hate to encourage the Interpol curse, <em>Alight of Night</em> is lousy with Joy Division. It's not just Hargett's dolorous baritone or word-associative post-industrial rumblings, but also the Hook/Sumner-like bass/guitar <em>pas de deux</em> that render many of Crystal Stilts' songs surprisingly amenable to awkward, self-conscious foot-shuffling.<br/><br/>If the worst you can say about an album is that it's derivative and harbors a few ho-hum tracks, that ain't much in the liability column-- particularly when said album is stocked with so many good-to-great songs. Crystal Stilts make terrific use of their recycled material, appropriating favorite forebears' brooding moves (and their richly endowed signifiers), and contributing their own deft hooks and stealth energy. ""Departure"" would be an unlikely anthem most seasons, but in this autumn of our discontent its single-minded, breathlessly chugging bass, no-bullshit beats, elegiac keys, and chiming guitar raising the melody above the muck... it's perfect. ""Departure""'s the song you reach for when you want to party like it's 1929.</p></div>"|12381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12381-alight-of-night/|8.1|Amy Granzin

Or she'd front a ferocious rock band, exercising those mighty lungs in front of stacks of amps. But on Callers' <em>Fortune</em>, she has just one steady partner. And while guitarist Ryan Seaton provides varied and distinct atmospheres for each song, the backdrops remain spare: room sound colors the mood, and Lucas moans like she has nothing left to sing to.</p><p><em>Fortune</em> is barebones, opening with a quick haunter (""Valerie""), followed by a brittle blues that starts: ""I love you/ More than is right."" The loose waltz staggers to the tune of Seaton's staccato guitar, and you can almost hear Lucas staring daggers at a telephone that's not ringing. But this is one of the most desultory tracks: while it's mostly a ballads album rooted in folk and blues, <em>Fortune </em>is also eclectic-- a distant cousin of collaborations like Rustin Man or even Susanna and the Magical Orchestra, where two principals capable of anything try to stretch their reach without shaking off a cozy, morose mood. Each song gets a different setting, from the precise and lush classical guitar on tunes like ""In Blighted Gold"" or the woeful volume pedal on ""Debris"".</p><p>The atmospheres are strong, and the songs are solid. ""More Than Right"" stands out for its tune and its stumbling tempo, and ""Rone"" has the makings of a memorable, ""Shenandoah""-esque folk song, with its long, languid melody and exquisite pairing of guitars. ""Fortune"", one of the few songs with a rhythm section, makes a powerful setting for Lucas' yearning wails. Other tracks are incidental or merely lovely: their eclecticism keeps <em>Fortune </em>from finding a flow, and ""The Upper Lands"" sticks out as the lone smolder on the album.</p>
<p>I waited until the end to mention that Lucas and Seaton hail from New Orleans. They met at a caf√© there, and Lucas has sung and taught around the city. Around the time of Katrina, they moved to Rhode Island, where they recorded <em>Fortune</em>, and then landed in Brooklyn. In songs like ""Debris""-- an exquisite ballad of almost on-the-nose despair-- it's easy to read a connection to Katrina. But this isn't music about one tragedy or one tragic life: it absorbs those particulars to¬†reach and heal a bigger hollowness. Upon listening to <em>Fortune </em>in the car on one of those days last month when the global economy looked like it was going to collapse, I actually had to shut it off because it got to be too much. And of course, that's meant as high praise.</p></div>"|12372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12372-fortune/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

The creation of <em>Missiles</em> coincided with (and, it has been suggested, led to) the departure of five-sevenths of the band's most steady and successful lineup thus far. And while surviving Dears (and husband and wife) Murray Lightburn and Natalia Yanchak have since assembled a new seven-piece ensemble, the mounting list of ex-Dears on Wikipedia coupled with the Montreal act's relatively brief existence practically has these guys shifting at a Fall-like pace. Quite a feat for a band that sounds so composed on record and isn't fronted by Mark E. Smith. What's more, <em>Missiles</em> marks a new relationship with yet another record label-- Silverlake, California-based Dangerbird-- meaning the Dears have parted ways with Bella Union abroad and, in these parts, Arts &amp; Crafts, a label not exactly known for artist turnover. Given all this-- plus a few reportedly less than perfect tours and a succession of breakthroughs that never quite happened-- it comes as little surprise that Lightburn began a recent e-newsletter to fans announcing the new record by admitting ""This could have been a message saying that the Dears is over.""<br/><br/>Well, the Dears are here to stay for now, and to their credit, they've managed to turn any misgivings they might have about setbacks over the years into their most consistent, and, in a number of ways, most accomplished release to date. It's not without its snags-- we'll get to those-- but <em>Missiles</em> is the sound of the Dears finding their footing again, picking their heads up, wiping their eyes, and pushing forward. And while by no means a knockout comeback, it's a record <em>about</em> coming back, at times hesitant and unsure, but frequently all the more engaging for it. Its thesis, as it were, is right there in the group backing vocal on opening track ""Disclaimer"": a repeated invitation to ""Come back.""<br/><br/>Musically, the Dears stay on point on <em>Missiles</em>. They've long excelled at atmosphere, and the tag ""cinematic"" stuck early and has since become adjectival shorthand for the band's sound. It applies here as well, though the group's sense of cinema feels more refined on the whole on the new record. Gone are the days when the Dears would tarnish a perfectly good song with an overcooked outro (see ""Never Destroy Us"" off <em>No Cities Left</em>) or indulge in multi-part epics seemingly for their own sakes. Instead we get subtler touches: the dappled string bits on ""Lights Off"", the brief spray of static that serves as a bridge between ""Meltdown in A Major"" and closing slowburner ""Saviour"", and all sorts of well-employed keyboard embellishments. Even the children's choir-- a red flag-raiser if there ever was one-- is put to great use on that closing track. Sure, it's a pretty obvious move, but how better, sonically, to signify starting over?<br/><br/>This newfound restraint sometimes works against the Dears, however. <em>Missiles</em> is a record largely without proper choruses, instead favoring songs that unfold gradually-- a linear approach rather than a cyclical one. Yet with a running time of nearly an hour, this means several tracks that meander and a couple crescendos that feel undeserved. Elsewhere, on ""Dream Job"", Lightburn sings, ""I know that sounds familiar/ 'Cause we've heard it all before,"" and that's certainly true later on ""Berlin Heart"", with its vocal melody too close for comfort to that of Radiohead's ""No Surprises"" (the same track is further hindered by a banjo that sounds out of place). Yet the overall sound on <em>Missiles</em> is, simply put, <em>inviting</em>. That's seldom more evident than on ""Demons"", a multi-part mini-epic that crams just about everything people love about the Dears into exactly five minutes, suggesting these guys may still have that knockout in them.<br/><br/>On, then, to the real snag. Like pretty much every Dears record before it, <em>Missiles</em> is hampered to a significant degree by a number of full-on WTF lyrical moments. Aching ballad and title track ""Missiles"" takes on the difficult subject of racism, but any weight it may carry is abruptly shattered when Lightburn describes the song's antagonist as ""cool as a cucumber."" On ""Lights Off"", Lightburn declares, ""Do us all a favor/ Admit the defeat,"" one of several instances where a syllable is awkwardly shoehorned in in deference to a song's meter. And you'd be hard-pressed in any context to defend a line like (from ""Crisis 1 &amp; 2"") ""It's a suicide mission that has us by the balls."" Youch.<br/><br/>These ill-advised lyrical moments can be perplexing and occasionally frustrating given the amount of care manifest in the Dears' music, but in a strange way they speak to the band's major non-musical strength: an earnestness decidedly lacking in today's indie landscape. It may be that Lightburn values honesty and straightforwardness above all else in his songwriting, even if that means the occasional clich√© or corny conversational turn of phrase. And while there's still no excusing the ""balls"" line, overall even these lyrical shortcomings make a certain sense in light of the record's mood and theme. Indeed, anyone who has been down but decided to pick up again can probably relate: restoring any shattered dignity can wait-- it's all about getting on your feet first. And so, flaws aside, things are looking up for our Dears for the moment, something Lightburn seems to affirm by declaring, ""There will be a next time"" on ""Saviour"". But even if this should prove the final Dears release, it's a fitting farewell: a bittersweet march, slow and steady, off into the twilight.</p></div>"|12359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12359-missiles/|7.3|Matthew Solarski

Known for a tendency towards the peculiar (he recently made a mix for XLR8R.com entitled <em>Songs To Get Killed in the Woods To</em> and is rumored to produce tracks somewhere deep in the Pennsylvania forest), Tobacco employs old-fashioned electronic instrumentation such as analog synths and tape machines to create the hallucinatory sounds behind BMSR and his eponymous solo recordings. On <em>Fucked Up Friends</em>, his first companionless LP, Fec puts those toys to use for an effort that veers from his fulltime group's sunny-but-warped electronica and creeps towards a darker brand of instrumental hip-hop.</p><p>Displaying a knack for forceful beat-driven arrangements that were absent on BMSR's accomplished <em>Dandelion Gum</em>, Tobacco shows here that he can pull off capable leftfield hip-hop, but as an album, <em>Fucked Up Friends</em> lacks focus and variety. On a large majority of the record's 16 tracks (roughly five too many), Tobacco offers only slight variations on the same formula: bend analog synths into twisted melodies and set those atop puddles of tape hiss and clattering, lo-fi boombox beats. It's an intriguing approach that yields a few great songs, but because of the glut of similar material, these standout tracks tend to get lost in a neutralizing fog of sameyness.</p><p><em>Fucked Up Friends</em> is at its best when Tobacco lets his beats thump hard, like on mechanical opener ""Street Trash"", which combines gritty ghettoblaster thuds with an industrial, engine-revving groove. Halfway-point overachiever ""Berries That Burn""-- a track that starts on a stolen Boards of Canada astral hum before blasting off with aggressive drum patterns and pitchy siren synths-- also succeeds because of its beat-centric methodology. <em>Friends</em>' lone collaborative contribution comes courtesy of Definitive Jux rapper Aesop Rock-- as always, he's equal parts cleverness and eccentricity-- who lends rhymes to ""Dirt"", another strong cut. While the duet show offs each musician's singular talents, ""Dirt"" also brings into question the album's dearth of guest lyricists elsewhere (""Hawker Boat"" is one of several tracks begging for an MC).</p>
<p>Most frustrating, though, is <em>Friends</em>' excess weight; Tobacco seems unwilling to excise material that doesn't contribute to the record's overall vision. ""Hairy Candy"", for instance, is a perfectly decent track, but despite a finger-snapping rhythm, it's virtually identical to the psychedelic stuff on <em>Dandelion Gum</em>-- down to the vocoder-ed chorus. Meandering late-album tracks ""Little Pink Riding Hood"" and ""Tape Eater"" siphon energy away from earlier, stronger material and test the listener's patience with lazy Air-like lunar synths. Utterly pointless ""Get My Nails Did"" and ""--"", meanwhile, comprise just 16 seconds of total album time and seem to exist only for their kooky track names.</p>
<p>Ironically, these lackluster songs help to conjure an image of what a better <em>Friends</em> could have been-- namely a shorter LP or a potent EP keeping only the good bits. It's also surprising that Tobacco didn't consider a full-album collaboration with Aesop Rock or invite an assortment of visiting rappers to try on his beats as a traditional hip-hop producer might. Any of those records would have likely garnered more fan interest and provided a more compelling bridge to the next BMSR full-length.¬†</p></div>"|12367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12367-fucked-up-friends/|6.2|Joe Colly

When his band Whiskeytown leaped to the fore of the then-burgeoning alt-country movement with its classic 1995 debut, <em>Faithless Street</em>, Adams seemed like nothing less than a savior, a recklessly prodigal kid equally informed by punk rock and archetypal C&amp;W.¬† However, it soon seemed Adams' legendary petulance wasn't some <em>enfant terrible</em> act, but the manifestation of a self-absorbed temperament that has marked his output to this day.</p><p>It's hard to say whether this penchant for navel-gazing was always lurking inside Adams, or if the combined influences of New York City and minor celebrity produced it. Either way, over the past several years he's recognized his true calling as a quintessential singer-songwriter and subsequently shown himself to be solipsistic in the truest sense of the word. Adams really doesn't seem capable of imagining a world outside of himself anymore, and it's his greatest artistic downfall. His music rarely strives to connect or communicate with other people, and even at its best is exactly only as compelling as Adams himself is compelling.</p><p>Throughout his career, Adams has always seemed to be more successful the more closely he's hewn to his country roots, whether it be on his acclaimed 2000 solo debut <em>Heartbreaker</em> or 2005's unexpectedly strong <em>Jacksonville City Nights</em>. My guess as to why is that country's narrative and musical strictures keep Adams honest, toeing the line rather than wallowing in the moony murk that has characterized so much of what this too-prolific man has released in the past decade, including his newest effort with his band the Cardinals, <em>Cardinology</em>.</p>
<p><em>Cardinology</em>, like <em>Easy Tiger</em> or <em>Cold Roses</em> or <em>Love Is Hell</em> or you get the idea, is melodically sound, remarkably insular and largely unaffecting. It's all soft edges, and its punches feel like pillow fights. ""Born Into a Light"" is an admittedly solid opener, featuring some nice fingerpicking and evoking a rare sense of community, a generosity likewise echoed in ""Let Us Down Easy"". Unsurprisingly, these are the two songs most noticeably tinged by southern rural musical traditions, in this case an appealingly finessed mix of country and gospel. Early offerings ""Go Easy"" and ""Fix It"" aren't half-bad either, well-sung and fuller musically than much of Adams' other recent material, though it's hard to shake the recognition that even his most sonically vibrant moments are often forced to contend with his whininess.¬†</p>
<p>Following those pleasantly modest, <em>Paste</em>-worthy beginnings, however, Adams draws the blinds entirely and <em>Cardinology</em> starts sliding into self-indulgent banality of a sort so pinched and uninviting it makes Conor Oberst seem like Will Rogers (and I'm not even counting the butt-rock red herring ""Magick,"" which makes you wonder what Adams actually hears when he listens to the Rolling Stones or New York Dolls). The dreary ""Cobwebs"" is emblematic of the myopic stuff Adams has been doing ever since he hitched his star to the likes of Winona Ryder and Parker Posey, outfitted with an oh-so-typical reference to 5th Avenue and actually including the line ""if I fall will you pity me?"" The likes of ""Crossed Out Name"" and ""Natural Ghost"" do attest to Adams' reliably solid melodic sense but still come off wrapped up and wearying, while ""Sink Ships"" burns a good line about remembering ""you laughing/ Coming up the rickety stairs"" with a ridiculous central metaphor likening the search for love with filling out a job application. It's just one more reason why Adams shouldn't be putting <em>Cardinology</em> on his r√©sum√©.</p></div>"|12374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12374-cardinology/|4.7|Joshua Love

Rather than compromise Trail of Dead's punk-prog grandeur, <em>Source Tags</em>' bolstered recording budget allowed them to fully exploit those dichotomies, coaxing the melodic beauty out of the discord while infusing the band's signature crash-endos with apocalyptic heft.<br/><br/>But if the early chapters of Trail of Dead's history defied the usual indie-to-major sell-out script, their more recent history has sadly reverted to the usual clich√©s: First came the dismissal of bassist Neil Busch (the band's unsung George Harrison/John Entwhistle figure) amid rumors of drug abuse, followed by two increasingly overblown albums (2005's <em>Worlds Apart</em> and 2006's <em>So Divided</em>) that steered the band into ""November Rain"" power-ballad territory and failed to capitalize on <em>Source Tags</em>' momentum. And where Trail of Dead shows used to climax with the orgiastic destruction of their equipment, they were starting to <strong><a href=""/article/news/39848-trail-of-dead-dudes-brawl-onstage-guitarist-collapses"" target=""_blank"">take their frustration out on each other</a></strong>. In the context of this unfortunate decline, the band's fall 2007 tour with ""Metalocalypse"" cartoon thrashers Dethklok would thus qualify as their Spinal Tap/Puppet Show nadir.<br/><br/>However, like the breakdown/rebuild structures that figure in so many of their songs, Trail of Dead are positioning themselves for, if not an all-out comeback, then at least a back-to-basics rethink. This past summer saw core songwriters Conrad Keely and Jason Reece playing a handful of shows in a duo format for the first time since the band's initial 1994 formation, while the inevitable parting of ways with Interscope has inspired Trail of Dead to launch their own label, Richter Scale, presumably named for the song (""Richter Scale Madness"") that first introduced the band to the world 10 years ago. But if these developments hint at a return to the slash'n'burn guitar carnage of the band's 1998 self-titled debut, the first Richter Scale release, the <em>Festival Thyme</em> EP, tells a different story. As a preview of the band's as yet untitled sixth album, the four-song EP (available in mp3 and vinyl formats) still finds Keely leaning more heavily on the piano than the distortion pedal, and wild-card singing drummer Reece is once again relegated to a silent-partner role. But at least it shows Trail of Dead can effectively deliver the pomp without the pomposity.<br/><br/>Opening track and new-album teaser ""Bells of Creation"" (presented here in an alternate ""machete mix"") is emblematic of the band's transitory state: the verse melody echoes <em>Source Tags</em>' ""It Was There That I Saw You"" and the storming, mid-section surge sounds like another ""Another Morning Stoner"", but the stately presentation (ringing piano chords, martial drumbeat) and whiny, overdriven chorus (""I felt like Saaattaaann..."") are more beholden to the band's recent modern-rock-oriented M.O. ""Inland Sea"" (presented in ""edit"" form) follows a similar piano-ballad-gone-ballistic template but doesn't overdo either part of that equation, as Keely's ascending vocal line nicely complements the song's upward sweep, and the climactic instrumental build feels like a natural product of the song's momentum rather than a grafted-on mid-song detour.<br/><br/><em>Festival Thyme</em>'s vinyl version replaces ""Inland Sea"" with an unlikely cover of the Replacements' ""Within Your Reach"", Trail of Dead's second attempt at fleshing out a lo-fi indie-rock classic (following <em>So Divided</em>'s take on Guided by Voices' ""Gold Heart Mountaintop Queen Directory""), but arguably the EP's biggest curveball is the its track. Living up to its medieval moniker, ""Festival Thyme"" is a spirited folk stomp that's a close cousin to Sigur R√≥s' recent handclap-happy single ""Gobbledigook"", and it succeeds where Trail of Dead's recent forays into proggy pop have faltered, favouring a playful, campfire presentation over heavy-handed orchestration. It's too soon to say if the track signals a new avenue for Trail of Dead to explore, or if it's just a one-off lark; <em>Festival Thyme</em>'s closer, ""The Betrayal of Roger Casement &amp; the Irish Brigade"", is a typically calamitous instrumental that returns us to the piano-stoked melodrama of the EP's first two tracks, but the gaudy, almost Elton John-like (c.f. ""Funeral for a Friend"") flourishes and phased-out, Eddie Hazel-esque wah-wah noodling are kept in check by an undercurrent of corrosive guitar textures. Grammar buffs will recognize that the song is named after the Irish nationalist who was tried for treason in 1916 and ""hung by a comma"" due to poorly punctuated English law, and perhaps Trail of Dead feel like they too have been judged far too harshly in the court of rock-crit opinion in recent years. If that's the case, then <em>Festival Thyme</em> shows there's still enough fight in them to earn a reprieve.</p></div>"|12377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12377-festival-thyme-ep/|6.2|Stuart Berman

Unfortunately, every time she's seemed on the brink of some major breakthrough, something somewhere gets thrown off the rails. Jean has every right and reason to be as well-known as, at the very least, the Roots and Talib Kweli (who she's collaborated with successfully over the last few years). But for whatever reason-- bootleggers, disillusionment, label jerk-around moves, the industry's inability to properly market a female artist who operates more as a superhuman MC than as a sex symbol-- she's wound up operating closer to the fringes than someone with her experience and skill deserves, wavering between contemplations of retirement and selling 16-bar guest appearances on Craigslist.</p><p>So it's easy to wonder what things'd be like for her if <em>Jeanius </em>came out as scheduled, way back in 2004, rather than earlier this summer. That's because it's the kind of album you pull out when you want to convince a friend that this rapper he hasn't heard can do all this incredible shit, a potential career-definer that people can turn to when they want to quickly and definitively sum up the qualities of an artist with one easily-recommendable release. Longtime heads have known this for a while now; when the album leaked four years back and subsequently got shelved, it became one of those cause-celebre great lost albums like the Ghostface/MF DOOM <em>Swift &amp; Changeable </em>collab or Q-Tip's original 2006 draft of <em>Live at the Renaissance</em>. When <em>Jeanius</em> finally did drop legit on Kweli's Blacksmith label with little changed but some of the track titles, the familiarity had already set in-- which means this album's had a presidential term's worth of time to establish itself as a contemporary classic.</p><p>Jean the battler is in top form, and the half of the album where she goes about the business of shit-talking is superb: ""You don't like the way I flow/ 'She needs more emotion, though'/ I'll give you emotion, it's you, holdin' your broken nose""; ""controversy works, and plus I got a pussy/ But even with that, people scared to push me/ Who's a pussy first?""; ""Fuck the hearsay, please, Jean's superior/ Y'all yellow, same color of your bladder's interiors."" But her ability to convincingly go from supreme self-confidence to moments of doubt and personal tragedy reveal what a complete, relatable and human MC she is-- whether it's something like the self-aware battles with her own hard-headed personality traits on ""Don't Rush Me"", or ""My Story""'s harrowing confessional of <span>her post-abortion experiences-- or on </span>""<span>Desperada</span>""<span>, where she pledges to overcome it all and come out stronger on the other end. <span>Jean</span></span>'<span><span>s been accused of sounding cold and monotone by dudes who apparently forgot what made slick, collected cats like Guru and Erick Sermon great, but to these ears her flow sounds like a laser-focused, clear-spoken declaration of strength and perseverance.</span></span></p>
<p>All these emotional facets need a solid, consistent sound to keep them tied all together, and 9th Wonder is at the top of his game here, providing the bulk of Jeanius' production (with a couple tracks from fellow North Carolinians Khrysis and Fatin). At their best, 9th's beats do a good job of carrying tracks without making themselves the center of attention, but here they stand as some of his finest work because of how well he balances between heart-pulsing, head-nod beats and moody, grey-skied atmosphere: the piano/choir loop in ""Don't Rush Me"" sticks with you because it somehow pulls off the trick of sounding triumphant and mournful at the same time, and the way the ""Top Billin'""-in-a-straitjacket drums complement the recurring dubbed-out mournful vocal snippet from the Marvelettes' ""Uptown"" gives ""Billy Killer"" a strong, chilling undercurrent of jealous fury that Jean's lyrics etch into stone. Word has it Jean Grae and 9th are working on a grip of tracks for an upcoming release, <em>Phoenix</em>, and if that album's anywhere near as good as this one, we should finally stop having to ask ""what if"" and move on to ""how far.""</p></div>"|12378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12378-jeanius/|8.3|Nate Patrin

But Seattle-based producer Jake One actually did beats for all of them, and the further you go into his r√©sum√©, the more confounding it gets: last year alone he contributed beats to Young Buck's thugged-out <em>Buck the World, </em>Lifesavas' conscious-rap concept album <em>Gutterfly</em> and Turf Talk's hyphy hit <em>West Coast Vaccine (The Cure)</em>. But can a producer who's that versatile and mercenary manage to come up with an album's worth of beats that coheres enough to give you a one-shot sense of what it is he actually does stylistically?</p><p>Turns out that he can, if <em>White Van Music</em> is any indication. The good thing about Jake One cultivating such a diverse Rolodex is that he works like he's broken every stylistic and regional niche into its compound elements. The way the beat knocks is priority-- typified by densely-packed drums and thick, skulking basslines-- while everything else he incorporates, from simple piano and synth loops to shards of melodic vocal snippets to heavy funk guitar, is just there to be ushered along by the rhythm. There's enough diversity of mood from track to track-- foreboding gospel soul, spy-flick twang, slow-rolling electric-piano iciness-- but it's all tied together using that elemental 85-95 BPM 4/4 rhythmic backbone that anyone from any scene can rock over.</p><p>And if you want a litmus test or two, he's brought on a ridiculously wide range of regional voices to prove he can back up damn near anyone's lyrics. This lineup almost looks like the names brought up in an unusually open-minded rap fan's shuffle mode: MF Doom muttering intricately blunted phraseology (""Trap Door"", which boasts the aforementioned 007 vibe) followed up by Young Buck sneering workmanlike death threats (vague David Banner homage ""Dead Wrong""), a lyrical contortionist's field day in an Elzhi/Royce Da 5'9"" Detroit double-feature (the gleaming, brassy soul of ""Glow"") delivered after a slow-spitting showcase for the gravel-voiced hyphy pioneer Keak da Sneak (the sparsely twinkling ""Soil Raps""), Dilla-heir Black Milk and neo-g-funk vet Nottz put together on the same track (""I'm Coming"") just because they were two of Jake's favorite rapping producers. (""Maybe if I wasn't a terrible rapper I would have done a verse too,"" he jokes in the liner notes.)</p>
<p>That kitchen-sink approach also makes for a couple inspired team-ups, even if two of the best ones were thrown together after the fact: Freeway recorded his verse for ""The Truth"" in the unfulfilled hopes that Jay-Z and Kanye would show up, and Jake One plugged in a blazing verse from Brother Ali instead; an unused beat meant for Nas (""Oh Really"") got turned over to Posdnous from De La and had a typically smart-assed verse from Slug appended to it. And even if Prodigy's verse on ""White Van"" only lasts about twenty seconds, hearing him on the same track as Alchemist and Evidence means that tenuous connection between Dilated Peoples and Mobb Deep gets a little more solidified.</p>
<p>The flaw with <em>White Van Music</em> is that the lineup of lyricists just about guarantees that most heads will run across at least one track featuring an MC they can't stand. But the quality of the beats easily overcomes the somewhat odd novelty of hearing backpackers in close quarters with hardcore rappers, and with each listen it starts feeling more and more natural to have an all-star CD where M.O.P. and Little Brother both have hot tracks. Jake One isn't a household name-- yet-- and his beats might not be instantly recognizable as the work of a singular visionary, but if he can get all these disparate artists under the same roof and come out of it with a consistently enjoyable album, he's pulled off a hell of a feat nonetheless</p></div>"|12358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12358-white-van-music/|7.6|Nate Patrin

Granted, there's plenty of space to explore between the infinitesimal and the impossibly huge, and there's not much untrod ground in songs about love and nature, but at its best, <em>Palace</em> showcases the band's skill at making small things-- like Mauro Remiddi's mouse-like voice-- rise to meet the enormity of their surroundings. When it goes astray, though, the record reflects the inherent danger contained in the band's name: What begins as simple radiance can spread beyond control if not properly contained.<br><br><em>Palace</em>'s muscular, hook-laden jangle-pop underscores its pervasive romanticism, in both senses of the word. First, the definition with a capital ""R"": Like a chipper Ralph Waldo Emerson, Remiddi seeks to escape the confines of modern life and revel in the simple, solitary joys of the outdoors. On ""Stranger"", he wants to take a walk, to see ""how it feels to be alone,"" and he notes in ""Wilderness"" that, in order to comprehend nature, one must ""start to see differently, like the painters do."" ""Teenagers Talking"" and ""Lack of View"" both deal with falling down. In the latter, it's occasioned by ""hurricanes and thunders""; in the former, it's a possible outcome of embarrassment.<br><br>The anthemic ""All Our Songs"" also contains the line ""everyone's scared to fall,"" but the song marks <em>Palace</em>'s easy transition to the interpersonal definiton of romance, while keeping one eye on the external surroundings. Over rumbling drums, Remiddi sings, ""May the darkness in me be the light in you,"" with a melismatic falsetto emphasis on ""light."" He's not the world's most emphatic suitor, though, and ""Smallest Heart on Earth"" veers too close to the Chris Martin/Ben Gibbard realm of overly coy romantic panhandling: ""I don't want to bother you, just look what I found."" Despite a similar sentiment in ""End of the Road"" (""If you don't mind, I'd like to get lost with you""), the song more than makes up for it, detouring from its dark twang into a stop-start ""<a href=""http://www.imeem.com/rockitt/music/Rsy5LUcc/incredible_bongo_band_apache/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Apache</strong></a>"" breakdown at its conclusion.<br><br>Bits of mischief like that happen regularly on <em>Palace</em>, but occasional indulgences (like the six-minute-plus runtime of ""Heart"") push the boundaries of Sunny Day's strengths a bit too far. The mid-record ballad ""Siamese"" grinds momentum to a halt, pushing the already pervasive cuddliness of to the point of patience-testing, and ""Brainless"" is a goofy Polyphonic Spree/Flaming Lips pastiche that doesn't do the band any favors. ""Adrenaline"", a squiggly, hyperactive electronic lament to excess energy, is where Sunny Day should start for album two: It's fine to be overwhelmed and anxious, but take a few deep breaths before committing the resulting ideas to song, lest you recreate those same feelings in your listeners.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|12354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12354-summer-palace/|6.8|Eric Harvey

The Portland, Oregon-based sextet poured twangy Deadhead jams, loose, do-it-yourself Pavement sprawl, muscular Lynyrd Skynyrd riffs, anachronistic synthesizer bursts, and scruffy Band melodies into a rangy collection that was as thrilling for its stylistic alchemy as it was for its infectious good vibes. Precisely what made it so beguiling, however, also made it slightly infuriating: there was no cohesion between all of the diverse yet charmingly shaggy tracks, each one representing a specific sliver of Blitzen Trapper's multiple personalities. It was a gripping mishmash, and it proved that its creators had an obsession with the sounds of the 1970s and a gift for ramshackle melodies. But it left curious listeners wondering who Blitzen Trapper really were. For their follow-up (and Sub Pop debut), the band has narrowed its scope, sharpening their focus, and the result proves they don't need to try so many different approaches when they've found one that works so well.<br/><br/><em>Furr</em>, the band's fourth full-length, finds the six-piece giving in to their <em>Basement Tapes</em> urges. On acoustic tracks ""Lady on the Water"" and ""Black River Killer"", singer Eric Earley offers the most convincing Dylan vocals of this young century. And though the latter-- a gothic fugitive tale of sin, sheriffs, and stolen horses-- is bolstered by an unexpectedly spacey synth line, the former is the sort of sensual, stripped down song that Bob could have performed before he went electric at Newport. The band further pays homage to Mr. Zimmerman with the harmonicas they've spackled onto the title track's folky strummed tale of a wolfman's transformation and the spare, bittersweet piano hymn ""Not Your Lover"" (incidentally, the album's standout track). <br/><br/>Blitzen Trapper's more cohesive approach has yielded something that is becoming increasingly rare these days: An essential 13-song LP with no filler. There isn't an extraneous verse, much less a superfluous track here. Though they have more clearly defined their shambolic Americana this time around, they still show great range and unpredictability with their songwriting. The harmony-laden, 40-second pastoral coda to ""Love U"" and the entirety of the drawling, honeyed pedal-steel showcase ""Stolen Shoes &amp; a Rifle"" make a convincing argument that the dominant sound of Sub Pop in 2008 owes more to the country-rock poignancy of CSNY than the label's punk past (see also: Fleet Foxes, Hardly Art's Moondoggies). The first two and a half minutes of ""Love U"", however, are a fuzzy, howling soup of reverberating guitars and jittery drum fills set amidst a molasses-slow dirge. And ""Echo/Always On/EZ Con"" pulls their organic, earnest sound into strange territory, bleeding a ""See The Sky About to Rain""-like piano weeper into a brief, burbling mess of tech sounds that evolve into a funky disco strut. It is those sorts of unexpected flourishes that keep the album crackling with excitement and separate Blitzen Trapper from the rest of the bands that are trying their hands at a similar throwback sound. <br/><br/>It would have been hard to follow <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em> with anything as sprawling, expansive, or diverse, so Blitzen Trapper didn't try. Instead, they settled down, focused, and managed to create something even better. This imaginative, heartfelt collection is more intimate than its predecessor, reveling less in boundless stylistic freedom and more in the creativity afforded by structure. Blitzen Trapper are no longer talented jacks-of-all-trades, but a master of one, and <em>Furr</em> is proof that this already-great band gets even better as they define themselves more specifically.</p></div>"|12345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12345-furr/|8.5|Rebecca Raber

Particularly striking a chord with a younger generation of musicians, many have enthusiastically championed his progressive and influential sound. In 2007, Jens Lekman arranged the brief but tenderly constructed EP, <em>Four Songs By Arthur Russell</em>, which featured imaginative covers by Joel Gibb, Vera November, and Taken By Trees. Meanwhile, artists including Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear (who digitally restored and edited <em>Love Is Overtaking Me</em>), St. Vincent, and DFA's James Murphy have effused about their admiration for his distinctively free-flowing, compelling arrangements.<br/><br/>As Matt Wolf's perceptive, beautifully shot film, <em>Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell</em>, reveals, Arthur Russell quite literally had hundreds of tape reels documenting the material he recorded, from his first compositions in the early 1970s to the very last made in 1991, a year before he died of AIDS in New York City. <em>Love Is Overtaking Me</em>, a compilation of more as-yet-unavailable material created during those two decades, proves to be a valuable insight into Russell's extensive body of work. Most of the 21 tracks on this album have a more traditional singer/songwriter structure than the avant-garde cello compositions and kinetic, jazz-influenced disco for which he has also come to be known. Tracks such as ""Close My Eyes"", ""Oh Fernanda Why"", and the traditional cowboy song ""Goodbye Old Paint"", are strong examples of his connection to folk music and are largely developed on acoustic guitar. A common thread always runs throughout Russell's work and is well represented here: his moving, gentle voice-- and a knack for storytelling that could rival Bob Dylan. On this album, these lovely lyrical details are especially prevalent on songs like ""Habit of You"" and ""Big Moon"", where Russell's sensitivity and sense of humor gracefully anchor the music.<br/><br/>Many other great artists at a similar level of Russell's prolificacy have more than enough skeletons in their musical closet, plenty of which would only appeal to the most die-hard of fans. The tracks currently being dusted off in his archive, however, have so far been dependably strong, despite being mostly unfinished tracks of incredible musical variety. Russell himself was rarely satisfied with his results, preferring to move on to the next song rather than dotting the i's and crossing the t's. His creativity, it seems, was pretty much constant. He would work every day without fail, and the songs on <em>Love Is Overtaking Me</em> are a deftly selected microcosm of this brilliant musical world. The compilation features all elements of Russell's margin blurring, from the warm pop of ""Planted a Thought"" and the Modern Lovers-influenced delivery of ""Time Away"" to the stark, cello driven song, ""Eli"", where the vocals and strings seemed to be in a tonal battle, although this brings an urgency to the lyrics (about a lonesome, mistreated dog) and allows them to resonate in the best possible way.<br/><br/>At the time of his death, Russell's music had reached only a limited audience outside of his devoted, often high profile connections (he collaborated with Philip Glass, David Byrne, and Allen Ginsberg, among others). Yet his distinctive music has the rare resilience to keep growing, connecting to more and more people because of its extraordinarily contemporary, even timeless, quality. While he was alive, Russell and his relatively small group of listeners were convinced that his music should reach more ears; that it should be able to stretch across the same boundaries that his compositions navigated so elegantly. Now, through the care of Audika and the genuine love of fellow musicians and fans that have recognized his prodigious talent, Russell is finally getting the acknowledgment his honest, powerful, and most remarkable music deserves.</p></div>"|12375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12375-love-is-overtaking-me/|8.3|Mia Clarke

Imagine: an impossibly cute and dying-to-please young girl sets a camera on a tripod in her backyard and does a series of well-intentioned, but ultimately failed tumbling moves to prove her adoration of a significant other. It's almost enough to trump the fact that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFIxcuztZ0k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Apple recently licensed the song</strong></a> for an ad and made their own associations with it, namely a line of Nanos bleeding brightly colored paint. Not quite as cute, but if we use former Pitchfork contributor Nick Sylvester's metric for Apple's aims with ad music-- that it should sound close enough to a familiar iconic song but come at a much cheaper price-- ""Bruises"" works perfectly. At a time when most of us can still summon ""Young Folks"" and (the famously iPodded) ""1234"" from memory, and ""Bruises""-- a whiff of soul, but a stronger aroma of feminine allure mixed with little-girl na√Øvete-- is a more than obvious choice.</p><p><em>Inspire</em> can't match the precious glee of ""Bruises"" over its uneven length, but the trio tries from different angles, toying with several other ideas. They live in Brooklyn and are touring with Yeasayer, so if you guessed ""thick, vaguely Far-Eastern new age haze"" is one of their schticks, you're not too far off. It's put to best use on album-opening ""Garbage"", which sounds like nothing else right now, musically or ideologically. Over an oddly retro-futuristic palette, something like the synth-jazz theme song to a kitschy 1970s detective drama, Caroline Polachek laments the ever-increasing mountains of post-consumer detritus (VCRs, condoms and the like) like she feverishly wrote the lyrics on the way home from <em>WALL-E</em>.</p><p>Depending on your vantage, the differently alluring ""Planet Health"" could be drawn from two different worlds: The exotic sci-fi realm the title suggests, or the forgotten domain of proudly Orientalist synth-pop group Japan, on whose 1981 album <em>Tin Drum</em> its slap-bass, gong, and what sounds like a high-pitched koto would fit nicely. Polachek proves on ""Garbage""-- a high-concept bit of musical eco-sympathy-- that lyrical subtlety isn't always her first priority, but the ""Planet Health"" line ""I was trained in diversity, in the garden of puberty"" drops a ""Space Olympics""-level of awkwardness into a song that otherwise was losing me in its atmosphere. The title should give enough indication about this particular planet's topography, but to be specific, there exists a ""food pyramid"" and a ""desert of vitamins"" in this far-off world.</p>
<p>Other than the Human League-suggesting ""Evident Utensil"" (that utensil, coincidentally enough for rhyming purposes, is a pencil), the rest of <em>Inspire</em> feels distant and thin, with minor songs buried beneath a veil of mystique. Most often, that aura switches from the final frontier, to, well, the frontier. ""Somewhere Around Here"" is ersatz Cowboy Junkies, and ""Earwig Town"" and ""Don't Give a Damn"" nod toward Southwestern twang and straight-up country, but not convincingly. And that's understandable, of course: Chairlift are young and curious, still testing sounds on the way to a unique aesthetic, which parts of <em>Inspire</em> shows they are capable of achieving. While ""Bruises"" proves that a well-done song that sounds like other songs can make people take brief notice, <em>Inspire</em> mostly proves that recycling isn't the only answer.</p></div>"|12351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12351-does-you-inspire-you/|5.6|Eric Harvey

<p>These inspirations come into clearer focus when one considers the band's geography. Consisting of multi-instrumentalist/singer Ryan Schaefer and vocalist Nadja Korinth, Palms' only two members live with a literal ocean between them. Schaefer resides in New York and Korinth in Berlin. Not surprising, then, that some of New York and Germany's iconic underground acts-- here, Faust and Neu! share the same space with VU-- should provide the template for Palms' sound.</p>
<p>Palms at this point are probably too inexperienced to pursue a style with this kind of historical debt. Which might be why some portions of <i>It's Midnight In Honolulu</i>-- a promising record with several gratifying stretches-- come across as stilted and overthought. When Korinth shrieks atop ""Monte Alban""'s pulsating minimal synths, it feels like the duo is aiming for difficulty rather than quality. The same goes for ""Hang Your Head"", one of a handful of rock-leaning numbers. With short bursts of <i>Rid of Me</i>-style aggression, the song also sacrifices its listenability to chase some sense of rawness or importance.</p>
<p>Ironically, though, it's ""New Moon"", <i>Honolulu</i>'s warmest and loosest track, that provides the album's standout moment. A downright gorgeous song, it drifts like a vessel making its way out to sea, gliding and bobbing amidst a skittering arrangement that brings to mind Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project and standouts from Kompakt's <i>Pop Ambient</i> series. Korinth's vocals are at their most expressive here, sounding not unlike a female version of Sigur R√≥s' J√≥nsi Birgisson. Since Palms manage this tender, textural ambience with such ease, it's hard not to wonder why they chose not to explore it further.</p>
<p>The bulk of <i>Honolulu</i>'s material is less divisive than the tracks outlined above, falling somewhere on the quality scale between the distant poles of ""Monte Alban"" and ""New Moon"". Stylistically, the remaining songs are split almost evenly between frosty electro-pop and sparse VU-style stompers, and Palms are usually able to yield positive results from both methods. The emotive ""Das Lowenfell"" is probably the best illustration of the former approach; the track utilizes military style drums, acoustic guitars, and synthetic flourishes as a canvas for Korinth to paint her gloomy half-German, half-English vocals. Also effective is ""Boundary Waters"", a spooky industrial number comprising rapid-fire beats and siren snatches that takes its cues from dark techno acts such as the Knife.</p>
<p>""End of Term"" and ""Leather Daddies"", meanwhile, represent <i> Honolulu</i>'s proto-punk section, and while these songs manage a capable (and often enjoyable) impression of 1960s skronk, it's nothing we haven't heard countless times before. And that's part of the reason <i> Honolulu</i> isn't as good as it could be-- the band seems more interested in modernizing classic records of the past instead of forging its own path. Their cold seriousness also treads much too closely to that ever-perilous point of becoming pretentious. Still, if Palms can manage to let their hair down a bit and locate their own voice, there's no reason this band can't go places. ¬†</p></div>"|12347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12347-its-midnight-in-honolulu/|6.9|Joe Colly

If you're reading this from the U.S., you might not realize that, even though the group has moved a relatively impressive number of albums in America as well. Stuff that sounds this British usually winds up in the ""cult"" file over here though, and the Kaisers have been no exception. <em>Off With Their Heads</em> is the Leeds quintet's third LP, and although it isn't poised to break the UK group out of Keane/Snow Patrol territory-- let alone Coldplay or Gorillaz-- it recaptures some of the ebullience of their 2005 debut, <em>Employment, </em>after the darker cynicism of the follow-up, <em>Yours Truly, Angry Mob</em>.</p><p>Their latest approach to winning converts appears to be to make music so ridiculous that you at least have to notice it. Opener ""Spanish Metal"" cuts right to the chase in its first few bars, a hard-rock guitar-and-organ riffs that's so over the top it has to be tongue in cheek. It really is ludicrous, but it's fun, too, and the band balances it with a good verse where the guitars drop out, leaving just the drums, bass, and harmony vocals. There's even finger-tapping toward the end. The other song that most embodies this irresistible ridiculousness is ""Addicted to Drugs"", whose title refrain, alas, isn't sung to the tune of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"", even though it seems clear they had the song in mind. Instead, the discofied chorus, blue-eyed soul backing vocals, and genuinely funny lyrics practically force you to enjoy it. Yes, there's cowbell.</p><p>Vocalist Ricky Wilson seems to be having more fun this time out, as on the New Wave-y ""Half the Truth"", which actually has two choruses, the second of which is the punchline: ""I will not lie to you, but I'll definitely only give you half the truth."" I have no idea what they were thinking bringing in Sway DaSafo to rap a verse, but it doesn't work. The other noticeable guest is Lily Allen, who's in on backing vocals on two songs, including single ""Never Miss a Beat"", which seems to be a criticism of anti-intellectualism with its repeats of ""it's cool to know nothing."" The most notable song, though, might actually be closer ""Remember You're a Girl"", which finds the band in new territory with its quiet, minor-key melody and understated backing from the band. It's so divorced from the rest of the record that it almost sounds like a different group snuck their song onto the album. That's not great for continuity, but it is a nice reprieve from the constant harmonies and blasting guitars that make some of the less exceptional songs bleed together.</p>
<p>In the end, Kaiser Chiefs are a band of anthems, and this album offers a few clues that they're capable of doing other things when they wish to-- it doesn't seem like an accident that they're named for a soccer club, given the terrace-like audience their songs are built for. It's not all great-- ""You Want History"" can't overcome rhyming ""mystery"" with ""history"" or its leaden coda, for example-- but it is at least as good as their debut, if not just a tick better for its relative dynamic and tonal variety.</p></div>"|12368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12368-off-with-their-heads/|6.8|Joe Tangari

Looks like it's a sentiment that he's taken with him. Over the course of 11 albums, he's been embroiled in some sort of existential conundrum, if not crisis, as he's attempted to reconcile a background in formal jazz with the manic possibilities afforded by sequencing and sound manipulation. A veritable thesaurus of musical experimentation, Jenkinson has pushed a spitfire chorus of fully formed studies in blending fusion with breakbeats, acid with funk. But whether this litany is meant to be enjoyed or simply admired is up for debate. It's true that his work (and of course his bass and drumming virtuosity) is due respect, but the intersection of his hardcore appreciators (tweaked tech-heads and staid jazz appreciators) might just as soon stroke their chins as develop emotional reactions to it.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Just a Souvenir</em> could just bridge Jenkinson's longtime appreciation gap. Heck, it's just about the Squarepusher equivalent to <em>Sgt. Pepper's</em>. <em>Souvenir</em> is ostensibly a concept album, complete with a cockamamie yarn Jenkinson has spun about its woozily constructed device: ""a daydream about watching a crazy, beautiful rock band play an ultra-gig"" centered around a giant neon coat-hanger. Into his vision enter guitars that can manipulate space-time, Eskimos, chainsaws, and Cro-Magnons. At the conclusion, Jenkinson laments that his memory of the scene is his only souvenir-- add a dash of humility, and you've got a title! And although it's 2004's <em>Ultravisitor</em>, with its ever-present crowd samples, that sounds like a live album, <em>Souvenir</em> leaves distinct impressions of an otherworldly rock spectacle.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">True to concept, the record as a whole sounds more organic than any Squarepusher release dating back, perhaps, to <em>Music Is Rotted One Note</em>-- excepting <em>Souvenir</em>'s obvious counterexample in ""A Real Woman"", whose vocoded robot narrator bemoans its cluelessness in the ways of the human female. Jenkinson announces his newfound humanity right off the bat with opener ""Star Time 2"", which sedately re-imagines the track ""Coopers World"" that opened his seminal <em>Hard Normal Daddy</em>. The drill-and-bass salvos that slashed across ""Cooper"" and many of Jenkinson's canvases of old have been toned down or eradicated-- only minimal echoes of the signature Amen Break beat show up, with comparatively little sequenced percussion remaining. Tom still wails on his bass, capably delivering a master class in funky fills, but its delivery through the riffy, frenetic math-punk of ""Delta-V"" and ""Planet Gear"" is most surprising. By recasting his relentless, aggressive textures into rock, he's breathed a curious new life into them, imbuing a sort of alien quality to what in less capable hands could have turned out as reruns of someone else's garage rock or funk-punk.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As the languid classical guitar that dots the album brings it to a close, it hits that this 44-minute opus is perhaps more inviting, and more melodic, than anything Jenkinson has done in a long time. It's certainly an easier listen than 80 minutes of <em>Ultravisitor</em> or an hour of <em>Hello Everything</em>. <em>Souvenir</em>, comparatively, is a demure beast of wistful robot voices framing jazz improvisation, alien rock jams evoking the aging belligerence of breakbeats, and pastoral drone backdrops adorned by jerky guitar ballads. But <em>Souvenir</em> isn't just an outlet for nonfans to ""get"" Squarepusher. By abstractly distilling the principles that guide Squarepusher, the record arrives readymade for the chin-stroking die-hards out there to endlessly theorize about the connection between the music maker, the music, and his/its audience. <span>¬†</span>If indeed music is the only souvenir gained from these trips to the unknown, then this disheveled spitfire, once lost in his little world of glitches and jazz scales, might have unearthed this particular bauble on the journey to meet the rest of us halfway.</p></div>"|12376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12376-just-a-souvenir/|7.6|Mike Orme

Indeed, sap and smarm have been the principal currencies of America's leading piano wise guy, at least since the pinnacle of Ben Folds Five's commercial success in 1998. <em>Whatever and Ever Amen</em>, the band's best-selling second album, broke Folds into the mainstream through ""Brick"", a tender, regretful ballad about a girlfriend's abortion. Of course, the album's next song and final single, the infamous ""Song for the Dumped"", slammed open, ""So you wanted to take a break? Slow it down some and have some space? Well fuck you, too."" Likewise, on Folds' solo debut, 2001's <em>Rockin' the Suburbs</em>, a song about a woman's dependence on others-- right up to the pallbearers carrying her to her grave-- fails before a number about doing acid and climbing trees and another about Michael Jackson, Quiet Riot, and ""being male, middle-class, and white.""</p><p>On <em>Way to Normal</em>, Folds' third solo studio LP since Ben Folds Five broke up in 2000, he strives for that same imbalance and juxtaposition, pitting laments about missed opportunities with old lovers and failed communication in otherwise good relationships against quips about slashed basketballs and snide yuppies. This time, though, Folds' humor gets the best of his feelings. He does the whiny white boy thing he's always done yet again. It's just that, as he and we age, that coy condescension bullshit gets less charming than wearisome. On <em>Way to Normal</em>, Folds seems out for everybody: the baristas who only give him free coffee because he's rich, the rich who snub the struggling baristas, the male dog who ran away from him, the female dog who flipped out on the little guy. This go around, the humor only works when Folds directs his derision at himself, namely on the fuzz-bass opener, ""Hiroshima (B B B Benny Hit His Head)"". As for the romance, the love tracks here are surprisingly impersonal and repetitive for Folds, who married his fourth wife between this album and the last. The old allure has soured or staled.</p><p>Indeed, all too often, the jokes unintentionally fall against Folds here. He issues his grievances with a smart-ass certainty, rarely showing empathy or compassion for his characters or admitting that maybe it's his perspective that's skewed. He seems less interested in understanding others than denouncing them. In the process, he sounds silly, sad, and incredibly smug. He devotes an entire track to scoffing at unconventional healers (the psychic, acupuncturist, and chiropractor) before taking a stab at the yuppy cliques that use them one track later (the Anthropologie chain, coffee drinkers, yoga addicts: all on notice).</p>
<p>On ""Brainwascht"", Folds rails against the former friend of an ex-lover who's written an ostensibly shitty one-sided pop song about Folds' faults as a lover. Coupled with ""Bitch Went Nuts"", Folds sounds like the sort of mate who's convinced he's never been wrong. The track opens with an unfortunate parody of <em>The Karate Kid</em>'s Mr. Miyagi detailing the reasons relationships fail. Apparently, women dump guys for trivial stuff. He's a bad fuck or a simple douche. Men dump women, though, because, as Folds exclaims, they're crazy: ""The bitch went nuts/ She photoshopped my face/ On to every boy who'd done her wrong."" ""Errant Dog"", which calls a runaway male dog a bitch as Folds indulges his nasty habit of cussing when he has nothing better to do, makes the pianist sound like a dog beater, a litigious whiner, and mostly an asshole. Sure, maybe it's a joke, but-- like much of <em>Way to Normal</em>-- it's just not funny.</p>
<p>In all fairness, Folds uses the errant dog simile to describe himself in ""You Don't Know Me"", the album's single and best song thanks in no small part to Regina Spektor's waifish vocal lines. That's only reflective of <em>Way to Normal</em>'s other missed opportunities, though. What's most unfortunate about the male, upper-class, and white content of <em>Way to Normal</em> is that it's tied to some of Folds' strongest post-Five compositions yet. Aside from the spoken-word intro, ""Bitch Went Nuts"" is a musical gem, its clangorous piano bounding headlong into a perfect instrumental break. Too bad it's almost impossible to overlook the song's lyrics. Similarly, ""Cologne"" is a gorgeous love song with <em>Reinhold Messner</em>-style strings-- at least until Folds decides to mention the astronaut who drove to Florida wearing diapers. Folds has always been at his best telling stories in his own smirking way. On <em>Way to Normal</em>, the stories sort of make you wish he'd see a shrink already.</p></div>"|12370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12370-way-to-normal/|2.7|Grayson Currin

Most of the time when someone complains about rap being corny, it's because it's not ""street"" enough, or doesn't take itself seriously, or is otherwise lighthearted-- those aren't signs that something's going to be unlistenable bullshit. Most of the stuff that Solesides-cum-Quannum dropped in the late 90s/early 00s, for instance, was almost completely devoid of anything that could be considered threatening by hip-hop fans' parents-- except maybe the warnings of lyrical destruction. But it was created by MCs who were charismatic, agile lyricists with authoritative voices, backed by DJs and producers who had enough of an ear for funk to counter any potential granola tendencies with the shit that got heads nodding.<br/><br/> But <em>damn</em>, the Mighty Underdogs are corny. And that's kind of startling, given their component parts: Gift of Gab killed it enough on the last three Blackalicious albums that his name's still an automatic positive, and Lateef the Truth Speaker has been scarce enough in recent years (Maroons aside) that the opportunity to hear him over the course of more than a dozen tracks should be welcome. Throw in an underheard but promising producer in Headnodic (of Crown City Rockers), and you've got yourself a potential backpacker supergroup. But <em>Droppin</em>'<em> Science Fiction </em>isn't the lyrical throwdown that you'd expect from the voices behind classics like ""You Didn't Know That Though"" or ""The Wreckoning"", unless those voices decided that they could stand to be a lot goofier.<br/><br/> This is an unusually awkward record, one that pushes the non-threatening b-boy routine past good-natured lightheartedness into cloying silliness. You could chalk up some of the album's flaws to its gimmicky concept tracks that run on obvious premises: there's the B-movie horror story (""Monster""); the Wild West showdown (""Gunfight""); the outer-space extraterrestrial rocketship arglebargle (""Science Fiction""); the whimsical travelogue (""ILL Vacation""); the she's-hot-but-she's-a-slut sex jam (""Aye""). None of these concepts are new, but making them as broad and schticky as possible brings these cuts down. It's embarrassing to hear Gab try to sound like a grizzled old cowboy or a bellowing mad scientist; he seems to be shooting for a more eccentric take on his usual genial battle-rap style, but he winds up sounding as if he's sitting down to read picture-book stories to second graders. Lateef, meanwhile, just seems out of place, maintaining his usual cool-headed fire-spitting focus while everything around him turns into Velveeta. It might be more tolerable if Headnodic dialed down his production just a bit, but with rare exceptions, it's all elbow-ribbing Muppetry, a frivolous collection of ""Brady Bunch"" funk, and Hanna-Barbera dopiness that makes Danger Mouse's beats on <em>The Mouse and the Mask </em>sound like <em>Liquid Swords</em>.<br/><br/> The fact that this dorkiness has enveloped a few usually-on-point guests (MF Doom, Mr. Lif &amp; Akrobatik, DJ Shadow) is unfortunate enough; that it's being perpetrated by two MCs who've been consistently great since the early- to mid-90s just makes it more frustrating. They both still have the ability to string together tight phrases and taut internal rhymes, and on those rare tracks where they tackle more serious material (the Julian and Damian Marley-augmented ghetto lament ""So Sad""; the neglected-love apology ""Want You Back"") or focus on straightforward rapping-about-rapping (""Victorious""), you're reminded why you liked them in the first place. But you'll need all the reminders you can get, and <em>Droppin</em>'<em> Science Fiction </em>doesn't have too many-- instead, it's the hip-hop equivalent of a slapstick prop comic mugging for the camera.</p></div>"|12353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12353-droppin-science-fiction/|4.0|Nate Patrin

An undeniably gifted, exquisitely mannered young composer/songwriter, Kahane makes meticulously arranged art-pop with a heavy literary bent. It comes as absolutely no surprise that he's worked closely with Sufjan Stevens, as both men approach Americana with academic fondness and are keenly aware of the importance of geography to narrative.</p><p>In contrast to Stevens' Midwestern mien, however, the Northeast is Kahane's preferred backdrop, which makes him a pitch-perfect sonic representative of the NPR/<em>New Yorker</em>/tweedy East Coast mentality. By extension, Kahane's debut self-titled full-length succeeds and fails in almost exactly the same ways these organs succeed and fail, deserving praise for its intellectual curiosity even as it suffers from arid fustiness and self-regard.</p><p>Deride tight-sphincter tastefulness all you want, but NPR is an inveterate seeker of stories from out-of-the-way places, and that spirit of tolerance and voracious study informs Kahane's lyrical and musical efforts here as well. ""Underberg"", for example, pays tribute to a beloved old Brooklyn building on the day of its demolition. But instead of taking the long view of its historical relevance, Kahane opts for the rather more poignant short view of its personal significance, reminiscing on when ""In high school we would steal inside at night/ And make out by the glow of a traffic light."" When he broadens his scope, Kahane is equally capable of unearthing the interesting histories of famous names, using ""7 Middagh"" to reflect on the ambivalence of a WWII-era coterie of literary giants that included W.H. Auden and Carson McCullers (or maybe I'm just a sucker for songs that quote from Henry James).</p>
<p>From a sonic standpoint, Kahane's restlessness and ingenuity match the precociousness of his words, the album often abandoning pop's expected patterns of build and release with a less-predictable approach that comes closer to musical theatre. An array of instruments are deployed in unique ways, with Kahane using horns, strings, banjos, and drum fills almost as sentient characters, taking opportunity to cleverly doodle along the margins of his compositions with woodwinds (particularly on ""North Adams"" and ""Slow Down"").</p>
<p>The problem, then, comes down to delivery. In short, Kahane's earnestness makes Sufjan Stevens look like Gene Simmons. And while he's aiming for something a good deal more arty and highbrow than your usual indie-rock fare, he could stand to learn a few lessons from Stevens about drawing in listeners with popcraft and humanity. Too much of the album feels bloodless, lacking not only humor but also sex, passion, recklessness, and vitality.</p>
<p>Kahane is joined on ""Villanelles"" by Nickel Creek frontman and mandolinist Chris Thile, who lends his always-exemplary talents in service of the album's jauntiest, liveliest song. It's true that Kahane projects greater erudition than a pop-friendly guy like Thile. But it probably wouldn't hurt him to follow Thile's example and do things like cover Pavement songs and write instrumental tributes to minor Lord of the Rings characters.</p></div>"|12350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12350-gabriel-kahane/|5.1|Joshua Love

That canyon found the Atlanta noise-rock quintet at a precipice. In the few months prior, Deerhunter had added a new guitarist, Whitney Petty, to replace the departed Colin Mee. Lead singer Bradford Cox had released his debut solo album, <i>Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel</i>, under the name Atlas Sound. The band's third album, <i>Microcastle</i>, and its would-be surprise bonus disc, <i>Weird Era Cont.</i>, had both leaked half a year before they were due in stores. Unimpressed NIN fans were writing blog posts comparing Cox to Geddy Lee.</p>
<p><i></i>Like Trent Reznor, Cox is a classic outcast. But the real question is why Deerhunter aren't opening for Radiohead, as their friends in Liars and Grizzly Bear have done. Admirers and detractors of Deerhunter's 2007 breakout album, <i>Cryptograms</i>, all seemed to agree on one thing: Despite its status as an underground hit, it didn't explore totally new sounds. Radiohead didn't invent krautrock or avant-garde electronic music, either-- let alone UK post-punk, American alt-rock, or the Beatles. Instead, what they've done is use a stunning assortment of shrewd instrumental ideas to express contemporary anxiety and alienation, all in the form of pop songs, on albums conceived to be more than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>Deerhunter don't sound a lot like Radiohead, but they've absorbed the UK rock icons' outlook as fully as anybody. If <i>Cryptograms</i> holds any ""encoded message,"" I argued in a Pitchfork review, it's this: Deerhunter are a pop band. <i>Microcastle</i>/<i>Weird Era Cont.</i> proves me half-right. It sidesteps much of the art-damaged squall of previous Deerhunter records, but it doesn't embrace 1950s and 60s pop as intensely as lead singer Bradford Cox had intimated in early interviews. If <i>Cryptograms</i> brutalized the pop ideal like a guitar-wielding David Lynch, leaving the follow-up <i>Fluorescent Grey</i> EP an exquisite corpse, then <i>Microcastle</i> resurrects it, scar tissue and all. The resulting 2xCD set captures urgent and imaginative songs that reorganize 4AD haze, off-kilter indie pop, crashing garage-punk, forward-leaning krautrock, and hypnotic Kranky ambience into a singular-sounding call-to-arms.<br/><br/>Here, the band comes into their own by applying their own inspiringly distinctive, bleakly appealing sensibility to whatever ideas happen to move them. Fist-pumping first single ""Nothing Ever Happened"" shares most of a title with a Pavement deluxe-edition bonus track while sounding a lot like Magazine's more straightforward, hard-charging side. Another standout, ""Saved by Old Times"", pipes in the Black Lips' Cole Alexander for a dual-channel monologue disorientingly reminiscent of the Velvet Underground's ""The Murder Mystery"". (If you play it backwards, Cole namedrops Johnny Cash.)</p>
<p>""I take what I can/ I give what I have left,"" Cox sings softly, as if explaining his musical approach, on ""Green Jacket"", a piano-based track at the center of the album. It's part of the languid song suite that ends the first side of the album's vinyl edition and breaks the disc up much the way ambient interludes divided <i>Cryptograms</i>. Only this time, the lull lasts just 10 minutes, not 20, and even at its least structured it's always more accessible. ""Microcastle"" applies the quiet-quiet-loud structure of the Breeders' ""No Aloha"" to a slack, laconic rumination on starting anew. With treated mbiras, ""Activa"" turns the dream-pop of Cox's Atlas Sound solo work into a nightmare vision of wasted lives.</p>
<p>Despite an outsized and often compelling persona, Cox is in some ways absent from <i>Microcastle</i>. The first recognizable voice we hear belongs to guitarist Lockett Pundt, on second track ""Agoraphobia""; Pundt's gentle, repetitive wordplay-- ""Cover me, come for me, comfort me""-- cozies up against sunlit psych-pop (OK, about wanting to be buried alive for someone else's sexual gratification). Bass player Josh Fauver wrote most of ""Nothing Ever Happened"". The guitars are big, bright, and unusually unfucked-with. There's a finger-tapping guitar solo. All credit to Moses Archuleta for the propulsive drums.<br/> <br/>Deerhunter's slight shift toward directness mirrors, to an extent, the move Liars made with their harder-rocking self-titled album. It doesn't mean <i>Microcastle</i> breaks entirely away from album-unifying concepts. On bell-splashed Cox-Pundt collaboration ""Little Kids"", getting older means getting deader. By Pundt-led ""Neither of Us, Certainly"", it's a fate devoutly to be wished. Cox's 50s and 60s pop influences play a small but significant role, linking the wordless, Flamingoes-esque opener ""Cover Me (Slowly)"" to the warped Everly Brothers waltz of finale ""Twilight at Carbon Lake"". The Beatles' ""Please Please Me"" claimed that ""there's always rain in my heart""; on dynamic single candidate ""Never Stops"", there's always winter. In the end, ""Twilight"" says smell ya later to ""the frozen shit that was in your heart.""<br/><br/>If you thought the bonus disc would just be crappy outtakes, then you don't know Cox. <i>Weird Era Cont.</i> is surprisingly great in its own right, allowing Deerhunter to join Los Campesinos! in the two-good-albums-in-2008 club. This record sparkles right from the ghostly noise-pop of ""Backspace Century"" and the jerky dance-punk of ""Operation"". The girl-group bounce of ""Vox Humana"" puts Cox's underrated lyrical skills on full display, while ""Vox Celeste"" throws the neo-shoegaze gauntlet down in the face of the reunited My Bloody Valentine. Reverb drenches Pundt's voice on the luminous ""Dot Gain"". Instrumentals make a fine return, too, ranging from Faust-meets-Animal Collective loops to noise-music drones. ""Focus Group"" is a sweetly chiming Smashing Pumpkins-esque guitar anthem that nearly rivals ""Nothing Ever Happened"" for skewed pop immediacy.<br/> <br/> The only song that appears on both discs is ""Calvary Scars"", which recounts a boy's willing, public crucifixion. It's a dual theme Deerhunter also explored on their self-titled first album's scrawly post-punk barb ""Adorno"", which mashes up crucifixion and suicide. On <i>Microcastle</i>, ""Calvary Scars"" is an ambient lullaby with mouthlike percussion; <i>Weird Era Cont.</i>'s ""Calvary Scars II / Aux."" is the track's heavier-sounding apotheosis, with an extended coda that's a bit like the live version of ""You Made Me Realise"", followed by a meditative electronic hum that's a bit like... the ringing in your ears after the live version of ""You Made Me Realise"". Or the calm after a cataclysm. There's a clear parallel with Radiohead's ""Morning Bell"", which appeared, in different versions, on both <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac.</i><br/> <br/> From ""Agoraphobia"" to ""Neither of Us, Uncertainly"" to ""Calvary Scars II / Aux."", sacrifical suicide could be a metaphor for artistic creation. On <i>Microcastle</i>/<i>Weird Era Cont.</i>, Cox sacrifices himself-- or at least, his colorful persona-- for the sake of Deerhunter's art. On stage, he really does sacrifice his illness-damaged body. ""I take what I can/ I give what I have left."" From a band who, unlike their peers No Age, have studiously avoided politics, spreading the idea that salvation can be found, or at least glimpsed, in art-- let alone in stupid pop records! That you probably downloaded for free!-- is a politically potent act. Hope. Change. At the very least, a reason not to slit our throats before President Palin decides to nuke the world in 2017.</p></div>"|12360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12360-microcastle-weird-era-cont/|9.2|Marc Hogan

Singer/lead spazz Arno (first names only with these guys, Beat Happening-style) awkwardly hacks at a guitar unfit for a six-year-old, guitarist Alex gingerly picks out dinky lead lines that sound piped from a ColecoVision, and Jock whales on a single drum and tinny snare like he was Keith Moon-- to call their scrappy, endearing racket ""infectious"" would be underselling it. Seeing them live hits about five different irrational pleasure centers at once, and on record their raw energy is just as palpable. The three years' worth of messy, crayon-scrawled punk singles collected on <i>It's Time!</i>-- each one well under two minutes-- marry the clatter of early Beat Happening and the Modern Lovers to the lovelorn dreaminess of Sarah Records wimps like Another Sunny Day.<br/><br/>For these guys, amateurism is a matter of devotion, and they take great pains to reconstruct the innocent illusion of ""hey gang, let's form a band!"" Playing better instruments, or playing their pitiful instruments better, would be traitorous: In this worldview, learning to play properly is, as Lester Bangs memorably put it, a deadening process equivalent to ""the putrefaction of a corpse."" Accordingly, the guitars on <i>It's Time!</i> sound like an aging cassette copy of Count Five's ""Psychotic Reaction"" taped by holding a Walkman up to the radio; Jock's single cymbal receives a bigger workout than a death metal drummer's double-kick; and Arno sings guilelessly and tunelessly about longing, confusion, and being misunderstood. It would be easy to lob some criticism about the artifice involved, or point out the inherent contradiction of paying such meticulous homage to Calvin Johnson's homemade DIY aesthetic, but these guys' sincerity, live or on record, cannot be doubted.<br/><br/>Not to mention that their tunes are great; it's hard even to single out the catchiest. Guitarist Alex cooks up maddeningly simple little earworms for every song: Check the ""breakdown"" of ""Baby Don't Do It"" or the stumbling shuffle of ""This Time Next Year"" for prime examples. ""Don't You Know?"" pogos along joyfully on a burbling bassline and coffee-percolator drums, while Arno offers unadorned yearning worthy of Jonathan Richman: ""Please don't say 'oh no don't go'/ Oh don't you know when it's over, it stays that way?"" In case it wasn't clear from the song titles-- nearly half of them end in question marks-- Arno belongs to the grand tradition of lovelorn wusses that includes Richman, Rivers Cuomo, and the Descendents' Milo Aukerman. Thankfully, however, he doesn't seem to carry around these men's internalized rage. Even when he's imploring ""Do you have any feelings at all?"" on ""You Don't Say"", he doesn't sound bitter, just broken-hearted. ""Say what you feel, it's okay, no one will judge you,"" repeated over and over, run the entirety of the lyrics to ""Say What You Feel"", accompanied by a perfect three-note girl-group guitar riff-- you don't get much sweeter or more gently encouraging than that. The lyric serves neatly as a statement of theme for these guys, and indeed for the purest, most inclusive impulses of all early punk rock, which caUSE co-MOTION! summon effortlessly.</p></div>"|12348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12348-its-time-singles-and-eps-2005-2008/|7.8|Jayson Greene

Though they are constantly folding new elements into their sound, each record is an enigmatic dispatch from the same basic world. These dudes hail from grey Portland, but they have somehow perfected the art of desert-rock mystery, and if you are currently planning your spiritual pilgrimage to New Mexico, be sure to pack this album along with some of your finest entheogens (the iboga plant, perhaps, or yage) and a copy of Terence McKenna's <i>The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching</i>. Trust me: you will enter the Rainbow Body before track three.</p>
<p>They haven't left the windswept desert of their minds, but over the last two years, Grails have gone from pleasantly trippy to permanently mind-altering.<i> </i> 2007's<i> Burning Off Impurities</i> was a relatively well-lit affair, and since then they've made a steady migration into ever-darker caverns. This year's <i>Take Refuge in Clean Living</i> was the first big step: alongside the usual artfully arranged head-rock, fuzzy bursts of white noise confounded your sense of distance while voices murmured low in the mix and bleeping Morse code floated in and out. Meanwhile, great whooshing atmospherics swept through the landscape like wind pounding a sand dune. On <i>Doomsdayer's Holiday</i>, the haze is even thicker, and the album represents a sort of endpoint to their journey: taking place in utter blackness, it is their most alluring and impenetrable trip yet.</p>
<p>It starts with the absolutely towering guitars. On the opening title track, they stagger about like B-movie monsters brought to life, and the song, with its slowly tolling riffs, resembles the sort of portentous intro track usually found on death metal albums. ""Reincarnation Blues"", which follows, features what is by far the most fearsome, monolithic stomp Grails have ever created. When the assault does let up, it is only to let a sawing, plaintive string instrument (likely either a kamancheh or an erhu) sing an otherworldly melody, and the alternation of relentless pounding with eerie interludes sharply evokes the queasy grip of a particularly nasty fever. When the song dissipates, midway through, into nothing but humming, ethereal voices, it inspires the same glassy-eyed wonder as Burial's ""Archangel"".</p>
<p>This is Grails' ""heaviest"" album, to be sure, with production assistance from people who've worked with Sunn O))), Faust, and others. But the heaviness doesn't just derive from distorted guitars: the entire album is overlaid with a vague sense of menace. When low voices begin a droning, wordless chant on ""Predestination Blues"", it feels like the awakening of something ancient and decidedly unfriendly.¬† Even the moments of calm-- the feather-light strumming of ""The Natural Man"", for instance-- take place at such a distance, under such a swirling dust cloud of ambient noise, that they are disquieting. It is only on ""Acid Rain"", the album's closer, when the pall lifts, and it is the most dramatic moment on the album: by simply modulating to a major key and lightening their guitar tones, Grails switch on the lights all at once, and the effect is like emerging from a cave into blinding sunshine: equal parts disorienting and reassuring.</p></div>"|12355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12355-doomsdayers-holiday/|7.6|Jayson Greene

It may have been written by Madison County preacher Lloyd Chandler around 1916, but some cite it as yet another early British folk song (also known as ""Conversations With Death"") ported over to Appalachia. The tune has been recorded by the likes of Dock Boggs, Roscoe Holcomb, and, most famously, the Stanley Brothers and later Ralph Stanley himself. It's on the <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em> soundtrack, and somewhat ahead of the curve, Camper Van Beethoven covered it, too. But where did the song really begin? No one knows.<br/><br/>The origins of the band O'Death are a lot less mysterious. They come from New York, among the latest of a long line of traditionalists who look to old-time music as a place to hang their contemporary quirks. They enlist fiddles and banjos to cover the Pixies, sing about murder and mournful mayhem, and add just enough punk energy to convince the cool kids it's OK to listen to mountain music. It's like rural Appalachia, were hillbillies to exchange moonshine for meth.<br/><br/>Which they probably have, of course, but that doesn't make this sort of bastardization any easier to take. Affectation is the name of the game on O'Death's third album, <em>Broken Hymns, Limbs and Skin.</em> The disc infuses folk with frenetic intensity, but it's all so over the top that it's hard to take it as anything more than a distraction, like an annoying buzz or a particularly scratchy pair of wool socks.<br/><br/>In its defense, however, that's pretty much par for this style-straddling subgenre, which, like ska-punk for example, takes an old-school template and makes it so overblown it practically pops like a balloon. Certainly Greg Jamie, who sings like a Depression-era carnival barker shouting through a megaphone straight into your ear, must realize his pinched, adenoidal style precludes much resonance and pushes the music further toward camp. The rhythm section, too, which juggles junkyard percussion with the hallmark polka beat of hardcore, is so far from subtle that it (literally) pounds out whatever nuance songs such as ""Vacant Moan"" or ""Grey Sun"" might possess. <br/><br/>Toss in some <em>de rigueur</em> Eastern European ""gypsy"" nods, and what you're left with is a band hedging its bets by opting for more, more, more rather than relenting to let a little breathing room into the music. The group downshifts a bit with the instrumental ""Leininger"", but the respite is brief. Even ""Angeline"" or ""Home"", both of which begin relatively restrained, can't resist going all spazzy, and in each case one can't help but recall bands such as the Meat Puppets, or even Camper Van, who did this stuff much better. <br/><br/>At their best, those bands were both subtle and smart. O'Death, on the other hand, deal almost entirely in broad strokes, which would be more acceptable were the bluster backed up by a stronger or more diverse set of songs, rather than a litany of murder ballad tropes and Americana clich√©s, magnified and distorted to such a degree that you're left cowed into exhausted submission. That might work on stage, where you can see the sweat flying off the band and get caught up in the excitement, but blasting from speakers it leans a little too close to punishment for comfort.</p></div>"|12361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12361-broken-hymns-limbs-and-skin/|4.1|Joshua Klein

It's not a stretch, if we're honest, to say that he writes about music more skillfully and illuminatingly than the majority of us who have ever done it full-time. He is, to put it bluntly, one of those people who gets it right far more often and in more different ways than your ordinary person really should. <i>Uproot</i> is another one of those instances.</p>
<p>In the broadest, most literal sense, Rupture came to rise as a mashup artist, and there are certainly elements of <i>Uproot</i>-- a mix following on the turrets of 2002's <i>Gold Teeth Thief</i> and <i>Minesweeper Suite</i> and 2005's <i>Low Income Tomorrowland</i>-- that find him flexing those muscles. To give him that tag, though, would be a bit misleading; Rupture uses the form to different ends. Folks like Girl Talk, Diplo, and A-Trak use mashups to make superficial connections, or to make people dance, or to be clever, or, sometimes, to be clever-clever. Rupture, as the name implies, creates fissures. He's less likely to rip four bars or a hooky lyric from something as he is to extract its mood in total; he's less interested in creating fleeting moments than he is in creating large, interweaving tapestries. Because his source material is generally pulled from dubstep, ragga, outr√© hip-hop, found sounds, and other indigenous musics, those tapestries can often sound political. Clayton has such a global, democratic ear and such a knack for soupy unease that it's difficult not to hear his mixes, at least partly, as commentary pieces. Even when, as is the case with <i>Uproot</i>, his mixes veer on the neatly manicured side, they still ultimately feel combustible out of the box.</p>
<p>While <i>Uproot</i> feels every bit as purposeful as those earlier mixes, it achieves that goal though different means. Musically, it's far more subdued and spacious; the lacerating swathes of digital noise have been subbed out for tracks that favor lonely, clattering rhythms, yawning sub-basslines, and displaced vocals. Like a lot of his contemporaries, Rupture has clearly gravitated towards dubstep over the past few years, and <i>Uproot</i> shows his selection skills in that space are as impeccable as they are elsewhere. From the cavernous glissandos in Frescoe's ""Afghanistan"" to the twerky, demodulated keys in Filastine's ""Hungry Ghost (Instrumental)"" to the haunted illbient fog of Moving Ninja's ""Uranium"", Clayton's selections are generous and far-reaching, and build a pretty compelling case for dubstep as the most creatively robust genre in electronic music right now.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, <i>Uproot</i> also features moments of genuine, unfettered softness and beauty. Atki2's ""Winter Buds"" is a dubstep rhythm that rests on an expected rush of warm piano chords, while Dead Leaf's ""Save From the Flames All That Yet Remains"" chases the looping, pulsing ambient of Professor Shehab + Lloop's ""Drunken Monkey (Ambient Remix)"" with a gentle swell of strings and pianos. Most notable, though, is the 1-2 punch that provides the mix's stirring midway point; a bittersweet interlude from cellist and Clayton collaborator Jenny Jones provides the segue into a few minutes from the second of Ekkehard Ehlers' terrific two-part ode to filmmaker John Cassavetes, from his 2002 album <i>Plays</i>. Although roundly earmarked as special by the relative few who heard it upon its release, history has arguably done ""Plays John Cassavetes"" a disservice. Clayton's resurrection of it here, in turn, speaks to another key reason his mixes are special; he's in the rare category of DJs who gives the impression that he is not just wading through music, but correcting it by building his own canon, and constructing an alternate history. It's a place you would want to live.</p></div>"|12371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12371-uproot/|8.8|Mark Pytlik

Which sounds dismissive yet is comforting-- the Sea and Cake are the definition of consistent and singular: They don't sound like anyone else, they're too smart and careful to make a truly bad record, and they're comfortable with existing range of possibilities of the project. So a new Sea and Cake album means you know what you are getting. This is their eighth full-length, and it follows just a year and a half after <em>Everybody</em>, so maybe some people haven't had a chance yet to miss the band. A lot more time separated each of the prior three (<em>The Fawn</em> in 1997, <em>Oui</em> in 2000, and <em>One Bedroom</em> in 2003), after all. Another Sea and Cake record, so soon?</p><p>But those who followed the band in its early days will recall that the Sea and Cake released their first three albums in just over a year, a run that, looking back, was one of those rare examples of a truly original band overflowing with creativity. Beginning as yet another side project in a Chicago scene that seemed like nothing but-- often great but relatively lesser bands like Shrimp Boat, the Coctails, and (sorry) Tortoise were among their antecedents-- the Sea and Cake were the ideal sorta-pop face of post-rock, as challenging and complex as their peers but a hell of a lot more listenable. Their self-tilted debut, <em>Nassau</em>, and <em>The Biz</em>-- the three records in that first early run-- are stuffed with fantastic songs and brimming with energy. During a decade obsessed with fusion, constantly looking for ways to integrate previously obscure music of the past into something new and fresh, the Sea and Cake hit a vein where the bright guitars of West Africa and the skittering samba of Brazil could mix with jazz, soul, calypso, and more under the umbrella of indie rock. With so much thrown into the pot, the early Sea and Cake enjoyed a flexibility that allowed them to create songs at will, and during that stretch songs like ""Jacking the Ball"", ""The Biz"", and ""Parasol"" sounded both surprising and strangely inevitable.</p><p>In 1997, the Sea and Cake released <em>The Fawn</em>, a smoother, slicker, and more muted album than its predecessors, and also one that leaned heavily toward electronics. Its sound and approach guided the band during the quiet period of the next ten years, during which they would release the two records that, while still good (there's that consistency again), stand now as their weakest. The problem with <em>Oui </em>and <em>One Bedroom </em>is hard to define since ""coasting"" isn't really a pejorative with this band; their M.O. is such that you <em>want</em> them to coast a little, to float along unencumbered by friction. Still, last year's <em>Everybody</em> showed what was missing from those records, serving as a reminder that melodic invention, a bit more drive, and quirky hooks had central roles on the best Sea and Cake albums. And all those qualities are present on <em>Car Alarm</em> to an even greater degree, making this their best album in over a decade.</p>
<p>The album is called <em>Car Alarm</em> and song titles allude to things like ""Weekend"", ""Window Sills"", and ""Down in the City"", all of which could conceivably be combined to sketch out the album's themes, maybe something about modern urban life and escape or something. But that's not the way that singer Sam Prekop's lyrics work. Words seem chosen for their musical qualities first, and there's faith that a stream of unconnected phrases will for each listener add up to something personal that makes sense. And it does indeed work out that way. The mood of the songs isn't driven by content of the words, but by the overall feel, the way the production and arrangements and melodious turns of phrase combine to create pictures in your head.</p>
<p>So the chiming acoustic guitars of ""Weekend"", rubbing up against the bright, chirpy keyboard sequence, all pivoting around the careful wobble of Eric Claridge's bass, evokes a brisk pan across a frenetic streetscape. The easy up-tempo chug of ""On a Letter"", with the drums and bass curling around each other for warmth, a guitar break with the relaxed gregariousness of a Jerry Garcia solo, and Sam Prekop jumping up a half-octave to his whispery upper register for emphasis, makes you think, say, of those moments when you feel just on the cusp of something great and are ready to make your move. The uptempo and spacious ""A Fuller Moon"", with its hints of steel drum and bubbly beat, is a great reminder of how effective the Sea and Cake can be when they put together a tune you can easily hum. ""Keep on holding on,"" Prekop sings, but there's never too much at stake in a Sea and Cake song, and that's the way it should be. Theirs is a contemplative sort of music, unapologetically cerebral even as it provides its share of physical pleasures.</p>
<p>The sound throughout-- as ever recorded and mixed by drummer John McEntire-- is gorgeous, and a nice reminder of how thoughtful simplicity can still carry a lot of weight. The guitar tone during the brief solo on ""New Schools"", brushed with the kind of glowing distortion that can only come from a vintage amp that's endured a long life in our debased world, is breathtaking, and other subtle touches abound. The minute-long synth pulse of ""CMS Sequence"" that follows ""On a Letter"" reinforces the album's commitment to flow, as its 12 songs in 38 minutes are laid together just so. The trend continues with the closing ""Mirrors"", an abstract but pretty 98-second steel drum instrumental finds the album-- another Sea and Cake record, yes, but one even completists will continue to reach for-- slipping quietly out the door when no one is looking.</p></div>"|12364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12364-car-alarm/|8.0|Mark Richardson

On their early recordings, the Brooklyn-based group-- which has entertained a rotating cast of contributors around core bandmembers Busy Gangnes and Melissa Livaudais-- aimed for droney experimentalism (typified on 2006's <em>Farewell Forest</em> EP) before trying on a delicate strain of funereal pop for ""I Can't Stand It"", the band's gorgeous contribution to Rare Book Room's <em>Living Bridge</em> compilation. Recently though, Telepathe has drawn inspiration from Hot 97-style club bangers and propulsive techno, and the group's current incarnation represents a shift towards haunted, beat-heavy electro pop.</p><p><em>Chrome's On It</em> is an EP that features two new tracks (the title cut and ""Bells"") arranged by Telepathe and Don Caballero's Eric Emm. It serves both as an official introduction to the band's rejiggered formula and a primer for <em>Dance Mother</em>, their long awaited, David Sitek-produced LP set for release in early 2009. The record also offers several remixes of each song by notable knob twiddlers such as Diplo's Mad Decent crew and Frankmusik, and it feels like Telepathe is using the release to drive home the point that, as of now at least, the band is making club music, albeit of the leftfield sort.</p><p>Both original songs are fascinating and, in many ways, sound like the work of a completely different band than the one that recorded ""I Can't Stand It"" less than a year ago. ""Chrome's On It"" rides elliptical drum patterns and distorted, squeaking synths before co-opting a Cash Money machine-gun beat about a minute in. ""Bells"", meanwhile, sounds simultaneously ghostly and danceable, its pallbearer vocals set apart from a reverse-looped rhythm that still manages to lurch forward. And despite the material's complicated production (dozens of tracks are stacked upon each other in each song), both cuts lend themselves well to reinterpretation, their individual bits easily unglued and re-affixed at different points for different outcomes.</p>
<p>""Chrome's On It"" is remixed here by Mad Decent, L.A. spaz-pop outfit the Mae Shi, and British vocalist/producer Frankmusik. And surprisingly it's the Mae Shi who make the most of the track. Their version fashions a new chorus by chopping Gangnes' and Livaudais' vocals into smaller parts and places them above a high-energy electro-house beat and catchy syncopated drums. For a guitar-based band that specializes in noisy outbursts, it's a very accomplished slice of melodic techno. The disc's ""B-side"" offers re-imaginings of ""Bells"" by electro-funk/post-punk duo Free Blood as well as Bobby Evans, the beatmaker for L.A. hip hoppers Brother Reade. The former's offering is superior, turning the song into a seedy, slow-building dirge with screeching guitars upping the spookiness factor.</p>
<p>More than anything, <em>Chrome's On It</em> announces Telepathe's capacity for exciting, eccentric dance music and emphasizes their love of the beat. Judged as a complete entity, the EP only lags because of its self-imposed repetitiveness-- one's patience for consecutive variations on the same template doesn't endure repeated listens-- and a few lackluster remixes. The Mad Decent contribution (which, perhaps tellingly, doesn't have Diplo's name specifically attached to it) is the real disappointment; the track seems unable to decide between worldly ghettotech and subterranean dubstep and never really takes off as a result. I would argue that <em>Chrome's On It</em> would have been more potent (and listenable) had the band decided to trim the fat, keeping only the Mae Shi and Free Blood reinterpretations alongside its two original pieces. But despite this bit of bloat, the best tracks here are quite strong and hint that the anticipated <em>Dance Mother</em> might be as good as we hope it will be.</p></div>"|12357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12357-chromes-on-it-ep/|7.0|Joe Colly

Faith Coloccia's piano is at the fore, yet it's grounded in pop simplicity. Behind her keys lie drums, small percussion, strings, acoustic and electric guitars, bits of vocals, and in general seemingly what was lying around. Coloccia's collaborators are labelmates from Hydra Head: three-fourths of angular post-hardcore outfit These Arms Are Snakes, Hozoji Matheson-Margullis of the less contorted Helms Alee, and Aaron Turner of atmospheric metal giants Isis. These players are all unrecognizable here. Despite the oceanic distortion they summon, this is not an aggressive record.<br/><br/>Not overtly so, anyway-- the pairing of piano with amplified noises often seems willfully odd. ""Suckling a Dead Litter"" wraps lovely piano ostinatos in industrial whistles and electric bass. Such background abrasions are distracting, but they also add context, relocating piano from its usual cloistered confines to, say, a steel mill. (Swedish experimental group Midaircondo have also utilized such juxtaposition.) There's something delightfully wrong about a red-hot, My Bloody Valentine-esque melody warbling over a naked piano. It's akin to the filmic device of calm foreground action with a catastrophe in the background.<br/><br/>Such exploration of depth perception drives ""Black Running Water"".  Diversions come and go-- the glassiness of what sounds like strings played <em>sul ponticello</em>; bagpipe-like melodies; reverbed, gunshot-like drums like Mad Professor remixing Joy Division. Yet the piano remains stately, weaving geometric, Michael Nyman-esque patterns. Such weathering of sonic storms makes the piano more poignant. It's frequently gorgeous; the distorted drone in ""Annwn"" hums like a giant vacuum cleaner, above which Coloccia unspools increasingly urgent filigrees.<br/><br/>This record's experimentation is both to its benefit and detriment.  It's a textural delight, but it's disjointed. The second track is a single tone that gradually expands into a haze of digital friction <em>√† la</em> Nadja or the Angelic Process. The final track is a piano-less acoustic guitar/electric bass workout.  While well-executed, neither track belongs. Yet such incongruity makes <em>Hirror Enniffer</em> interesting. The record doesn't mandate how to listen to it.  Played loud, its distorted bass could blow heads off. Played softly, its piano makes a fine background. (Coloccia recently scored the film <em>The Calm at the Edge of the Sea</em>.) It's refreshing to hear piano stripped of its usual connotations-- vehicle for virtuosity, prop for pop vocals-- and instead presented just as an instrument.</p></div>"|12356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12356-hirror-enniffer/|7.5|Cosmo Lee

Being a Kool Keith fan also requires a very short memory, since aside from a handful of laugh riots on <em>Spankmaster </em>(""N.B.A."", ""Drugs"") and the <em>Diesel Truckers </em>release that some will swear up and down was a return to form, he's since put out the same exact terrible album nearly every single year.</p><p>Because it isn't a ream of loosely-related expletives and thinly-veiled threats at OutKast like <em>Matthew, Dr. Dooom 2 </em>isn't Keith's worst album, but it doesn't do a whole lot to break recent trends, as it follows the latter-day Keith format of ""Oh, he's working with that dude again"" (in this case, KutMasta Kurt) and ""Oh, he's using that name again."" And at the very least, he at least sounds in better form, since as recently as three years ago, there was the implication that he'd gone strictly spoken-word.¬†</p><p>But ""first single""/selling point ""R.I.P. Dr. Octagon"" pretty much confirms how little there is to <em>Dr. Dooom 2 </em>if you're not interested in Keith's particular brand of inside baseball. Not that you'll be able to figure it out from the listless rambling about label conspiracies, but <em>First Come </em>was clearly borne out of Keith's surprising resentment of how Octagon's rhymes regarding chimpanzee acne and Manischewitz mostly caught the attention of Alternative Nation and glue-sniffing skate kids. Think of it as the first three Eminem albums on a exponentially smaller scale. <em>Dr. Dooom 2 </em>doesn't do much to acknowledge the narrative of its predecessor, which is pretty tough to do considering <em>First Come, First Served </em>managed to somehow house tracks like ""Bitch Gets No Love"" and ""I Run Rap"" with the surprisingly introspective ""Leave Me Alone"" under the auspices of a vengeful cannibal who also happened to be the best rapper alive. This being a 21st-century Kool Keith record, 75-85% of <em>Dr. Dooom 2 </em>finds him taking umbrage at artists that have the nerve to do things that might advance their career (networking, free drinks, and athletes seem to be particular hang-ups). For the most part, he just threatens to pee on people, which would be an interesting way to show one's superiority if Keith hadn't be doing some variation of the same thing for about the last ten years.¬†</p>
<p>In fact, a passing mention of Carmelo Anthony and a boast that pretty much contradicts the creation of Dr. Dooom (""white people love me like Fergie"") are about the only evidence of Keith absorbing cultural input of the last five years. The record begins with ""Simon"", which boasts oh-so-timely rants about ""American Idol"" before going off on one of Keith's many pointless tangents about the Gap. Other than the embarrassing <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> narrative of ""Run For Your Life"" and ""How Sexy"", which answers the rhetorical question of its title with ""not very,"" that's pretty much all you get.</p>
<p>But really, Keith's in a no-win situation. The past two decades of his career have mostly been predicated on criticizing uncreative rappers with left-field disses (""I'm starting to feel like Jimi Hendrix when they covered the story [of] who started rock""), and while not all chart-toppers are inspiring, being a fan of popular rap these days likely means you're likely a fan of Lil Wayne, Ghostface Killah, or even Aesop Rock. Maybe all three. Point is, mainstream listeners aren't exactly struggling with abstract concepts, and while acknowledging the debt he's owed might result in insufferable KRS-One entitlement, it couldn't be worse than Keith becoming increasingly isolated and weird, refusing to gracefully bow out.</p></div>"|12352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12352-dr-dooom-2/|3.7|Ian Cohen

His signature introduction-- as if he actually needed to tell an audience who he was-- is one of the best moments in recorded rock history, rendered in his immediately recognizable robust baritone and prompting unabashed applause. On all previous editions of this concert, whether vinyl, cassette, eight-track, or CD, have begun with that four-word intro, but Columbia/Legacy's new set relegates it to the actual moment in the show, well after Carl Perkins and the Statler Brothers have warmed up the crowd. Here it's revealed to be a rehearsed moment:</p><p>Hugh Cherry: I need your help. When John comes out here, he will say-- and which will be recorded-- ""Hi there. I'm Johnny Cash."" When he says that, then you respond. Don't respond to him walking out. Welcome him after he says, ""Johnny Cash."" I'll have my hands up, and you just follow me.</p><p>Johnny Cash: Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>Crowd: Goes nuts.</p>
<p>Call it staged if you want, but the moment comes across as genuine, as if the emcee had told the prisoners what they had planned to do anyway. And it's justified by Cash's notoriously volatile performance, which made this concert the foundation of his mid-career resurgence and the framing device for the 2005 biopic <em>Walk the Line</em>. His countercultural appeal during the late 1960s and his abiding popularity throughout the 1970s are grounded in the rough-and-tumble energy he exudes on stage. This edition of <em>At Folsom Prison</em> is a companion piece of sorts to Columbia/Legacy's 2006 reissue of <em>At San Quentin</em>, but it's easily the greater of the two, if only because it was both such a risky endeavor and such a rewarding payoff. When Cash and his crew arrived to play this show, he had been playing prisons routinely and had even serenaded the rowdy crowds at Folsom before, but this was the first time anyone had seen any commercial benefit in recording a show.</p>
<p>Described as worried but determined before the show, Cash gives a superlative performance, feisty and playful and a bit maudlin. It's an ideal setlist, with every song playing to the prisoners: ""25 Minutes to Go"" and ""Dark As a Dungeon"" of course, but also ""Green, Green Grass of Home"" and ""I Still Miss Someone"", which evoke a more general sense of yearning. Furthermore, the definitive versions of several of his hits are here, including the raucous ""Cocaine Blues"" and ""Folsom Prison Blues"", but the show is equally remarkable for the banter he maintains with the prisoners. Playing off their excitement, he slyly portrays himself as a rebel: Before ""I Still Miss Someone"", Cash explains, ""This show is being recorded for an album release on Columbia Records, and you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that."" Previously the latter has been bleeped out, but this reissue reinstates the expletive. ""How does that grab you, Bob?"" he asks, referring to producer Bob Johnston.</p>
<p>Cash played two shows that day, one at 9:40 in the morning and another at 12:40 in the afternoon. While previous editions of <em>At Folsom Prison</em> have reproduced the bulk of the first show while drawing one or two tracks from the second, the Columbia/Legacy edition presents both performances uncut and remastered, which gives the set a documentary feel as well as some historical weight. The first performance sounds tense and immediate, the second somewhat relieved, less energetic and therefore less urgent. The liners suggest that Cash was simply tired, but it seems more likely that the worst of it was over and he knew he had nothing left to prove at that point. Even so, the rough second-show performances of ""Greystone Chapel"" might just surpass Cash's first-show take. With June Carter and the Statlers, he runs through the song twice, channeling all his woe and weariness as he tries to get a good take. That the song's composer, Glen Sherley, was then a Folsom inmate not only lends it gravity, but also bolsters the suspicions Amanda Petrusich addresses in her Pitchfork review of <em>At San Quentin</em>-- namely, that Cash's prison shows ""exploited the convicts' plight to buoy his own rep.""</p>
<p>And of course, Cash never really did all the hard time he sang about in ""Folsom Prison Blues""; his violations were largely misdemeanors (picking flowers in Starkville, Mississippi) rather than outright felonies (shooting a man in Reno just to watch him die). But his lackluster rap sheet doesn't make these two shows any less rewarding or meaningful. Rather, they have the force of empathic endeavors, as if he were doing penance for his notorious bad habits. Having courted his own prison sentences-- both literally and metaphorically-- Cash knew how little separated the free and the condemned, so he turned his angst into raucous country music during his first performance and breathed a deep sigh of relief during his second.</p></div>"|12331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12331-johnny-cash-at-folsom-prison-legacy-edition/|9.7|Stephen M.

The Michigan-based duo have been working with shoegaze, dream pop, and ambient music for 15 years, and their mastery sounds effortless. Maybe it has something to do with working with a spouse-- there's always someone around to call you on your bullshit. Intimacy whittles away at the ego-driven blind spots where poor artistic decisions happen. It's like working with a mirror. You can't fool yourself.</p><p>And intimacy suffuses <em>Songs for the Broken Hearted</em>, a hushed, ascetic collection of long-form ambient compositions. Some of them are purely instrumental; great banks of fog lit softly from within. Sometimes Windy moves through them like a small figure with a lantern, as if searching for a way out, her voice a whisper amid a slow, steady gale. In turn, we feel as lost and lonesome as she sounds. That might not read like commendation, but it is. The album is sad, but not melodramatic; it's the quiet, complex suspension of feelings that informs adult sadness. Anyone who's been in a long-term relationship knows that intimacy and loneliness are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>There's nothing flashy about ""Btwn You + Me"", but its airily opaque drone (comparable to works by Christopher Bissonnette and Belong) is formidable, and Windy breathes into it so subtly that her voice sounds like part of its shapeless mass until it fragments into¬†wisps of language. ""La Douleur"" is just as uncompromising, a work in low rumble and high shine that seems continually to surge over a 12-minute arc. ""My Love"" breaks the colossal structures of the first two tracks into glittering shards, with discernible traces of the guitars Windy &amp; Carl process into impenetrable sheets; ""Rhodes"" striates them like a Growing track; ""When We Were"" bends them into monkish hymns. Throughout the formal variations, nothing feels out place or breaks the mood. That sort of refinement simply comes with practice.</p>
<p>But craft will only get you so far, especially in ambient music, which becomes blanker as it approaches the ideal. To fill that blankness, you need feeling, of which this album has a surplus. Its genesis looks something like this, according to a blog post by Windy: They made the initial recordings for <em>Songs</em> the same weekend she began her solo album, the equally austere <em>I Hate People</em>. As she worked obsessively on her solo album, Carl worked obsessively on these recordings. (This was a period of unspecified sadness for the couple.) Eventually, Carl gave Windy a CDR of the finished tracks; she listened to them and cried. Finally, she turned to her journals and found the words she couldn't seem to write. ""What was happening/ Between you and me?""</p>
<p>Picture them: Windy &amp; Carl, pursuing their private obsessions on different sides of a wall, trying to say in music what they couldn't say to each other in words. Even when the lyrics are hard to make out-- which they often are-- there's no mistaking their meaning. You can hear it in the distance between the words and the sounds, the beginning of each track and the end, what's said and what isn't. And that depth, those vast empty spaces, is what makes <em>Songs for the Broken Hearted</em> so enveloping and so remote at once.</p></div>"|12327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12327-songs-for-the-broken-hearted/|7.8|Brian Howe

The duo formed in 1980, taking their name from an Aldous Huxley novel, and have since put together a body of work as remarkable for its consistent quality as its near-total lack of mainstream recognition. They seem content to toil away in the shadows, though, working their unique post-punk niche in a way that sounds modern, yet somehow also very old. Their out-of-time-ness might account for some of their lack of recognition-- any time a trend comes along, there's a good chance they tired of it five years earlier. Case in point: On <em>Summer Salt &amp;</em><em> </em><em>Subway Sun</em> they've nearly abandoned their occasional weird-folk leanings in an era when weird folk music is hot property.<br/><br/>The most immediately striking feature of this album is the incredible lengths to which Beta-Lactam Ring has gone to package the thing. It's a 2xCD set housed in a hinged, hard-bound box with two slipcases inside, each solid enough to be their own packaging. There's also a lyric book, and the CDs have dust jackets to keep them from getting scratched. It's a display piece that seems ever the more lavish for appearing in the age of the mp3. The two discs, <em>Summer Salt</em> and <em>Subway Sun</em>, are stylistically similar-- simple sequencing seems to have been the sole determinant of what songs wound up where.<br/><br/>Bates and Becker rarely employ anything approaching a full drum kit, and these pieces of music derive most of their rhythmic energy from guitars, electronics, and percussion programming. Bates' smooth and clear tenor leads us through the soundscapes with melodic authority, his vocal lines often turning in strange and unexpected ways as the arrangements shift below them. One of the most masterful compositions on either disc is ""Where Vivid Bloomed"", where the wash of synth that backs the initial verses surprisingly coalesces into a shimmering loop and modulates to a new key. It's a spine-tingling moment where the band manage to wrench a strong emotional effect from a bed of entirely artificial sound, while simultaneously turning a static piece of music into something alive and urgent.<br/><br/>There are passages on the record that have the feel of intergalactic drift, as small, pinging sounds float through dark, icy spaces-- the coda of ""All New"" would probably sound just as good soundtracking a planetarium presentation. The duo's instrumentals range from quiet, ghostly, ambient explorations to workouts for drum machine and minimalist guitar. Though their music is too distinctive to peg to any particular peers, they bear a sort of spiritual similarity to Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, Talk Talk, and the Durutti Column-- artists who similarly filled the air between genres-- but these guys have done it longer than any of those colleagues. This album is accessible and ultimately enveloping, a worthwhile addition to an already expansive body of work from two musicians who have only ever been interested in doing their own thing.</p></div>"|12321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12321-summer-salt-subway-sun/|7.8|Joe Tangari

You can hear that experience and the confidence it inspires on <em>Of Sirens Born </em>(previously a 2006 CD-R on Gameboy). It's a dense, patient work that could only have been made by someone who's done this before. There are certainly precursors to his music: the haunting film scores of Popol Vuh, the all-night minimalism of Terry Riley, the garage din of Yellow Swans, the natural timbres of South American folk music. But the assured way that Raglani mixes these styles is less mimicry than synthesis, as if he were directing his influences like actors on a film set.</p><p>Raglani's movie features an ensemble cast, but the name above the title belongs to Popol Vuh. Through a Kranky press release, he cites the German group's score to Werner Herzog's <em>Aguirre, Wrath of God </em>as a reference point, and you can hear PV's trance-inducing soundtracks in this album's ringing atmospheres. That gives <em>Of Sirens Born </em>a cinematic quality, with widescreen drones perfect for slow pans across foggy landscapes and ominous bodies of water. Through layered sounds and well-timed changes, Raglani builds a wordless narrative, each track feeling like an abstract painting set in motion.</p><p>The most Popol Vuh moment is opener ""Rivers In"". Pushing choral tones like ocean waves, Raglani sounds both austere and organic. You can practically see empty fields of grass wafting back and forth to these windy chords. The 10-minute ""The Promise of Wood and Water"" follows with similar environmental leanings, but floats off a bit too far, caught in a loop of hums and chimes that veers toward new age.<em> Of Sirens Born </em>recovers quickly. ""Perilous Straits"" evokes Terry Riley with rolling tones that gradually grow denser yet somehow clearer. ""Jubilee"" continues that upward drift, as sheets of static and distortion cover each other like winter blankets.</p>
<p>The album's noisiest cut, ""Washed Ashore"", is its peak, a grinding sprint that conjures images of an exploding temple, then descends into small, sparse sounds, like the crackling embers of an acre-sized fire. On an album with such clear antecedants, it's the one track that sounds only like Raglani, blasting away all traces of influence. If he keeps heading in this direction, such reference-deletion will become permanent very soon.</p></div>"|12307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12307-of-sirens-born/|7.4|Marc Masters

For another, inscrutability is pretty much his career's one constant and trying to get into his head is a fool's errand. Each twist in the man's art leaves you scrambling to re-assess the last. For instance, his brace of old-time covers albums in the early 90s were decried as evidence that Bob's flush was finally busted-- the well was dry. Now it seems like they were the work of a craftsman re-acquainting himself with some of his most basic tools before putting them to more remarkable use. <br/><br/>How to put his work into context? <em>The Bootleg Series</em> is your best starter kit. <em>Tell Tale Signs</em> is the eighth volume in Dylan's anthology of discards, alternate takes, and live performances, this time offering an alternative path through his last two decades' work. The series presents itself as an appendix, but it's more like a glossary-- offering crucial insight and definition. And if that sounds too dry, rest assured there's also some astonishing music here. <br/><br/>If a critic can't write Dylan off, there's a temptation to go in the other direction: This collection's remit starts with 1989's <em>Oh Mercy</em>, hailed at the time as a staggering return to form. Now it sounds relatively clumsy, its reverb-heavy production straining to fit Dylan into a modern rock mold. But the songs were there, and<em> Tell Tale Signs</em> is thick with tracks from this period, casting it in a far richer light. The familiar is transformed: ""Most of the Time"", a vista of shimmery regret on <em>Oh Mercy</em>, becomes a delightfully rueful acoustic bounce lent extra warmth and wistfulness by its staccato harmonica. ""Dignity"" shows up as a weighty piano ballad and as a jaunty full-band outing that brings out the humor in the song-- I like that version more, but if there's one thing this collection tells you, it's that ""definitive"" with Dylan is a trick of the release schedule. <br/><br/>So is it even possible to speak generally about ""late Dylan""? It seems to me that his most recent period, the late flowering that kicked off with <em>Time Out of Mind</em> in 1997, has seen a shift in his approach. While the cluster of live tracks here demonstrate that he's still very much a rock artist, as a songwriter he's returned to blues and folk, with their storyteller's structure of verses and refrains. In place of a chorus, Dylan's songs often have a payoff that each verse winds its way towards and some of the joy is in following that image-trail to the repeated endpoint. The payoff refrain accumulates effect in different ways-- on ""Dignity"" it's ramming a point home, on ""Mississippi"" it's a resigned reminder that the narrator keeps on screwing up. On several tracks its inevitability brings the whole song an air of predestination, and the payoff has the weight of Judgement on it. ""High Water (For Charley Patton)""-- here in a fierce live version-- ends each verse with a cry of ""High water everywhere!"", the repetition making Dylan's catastrophic vision more and more encompassing. <br/><br/>""High Water"" fits <em>Tell Tale Signs</em>' overall mood-- one of barfly eschatology, smokily rambling half-stories of lust and loss, and a dash of apocalypse, told with a chuckle that's halfway to a death rattle. The vibe crosses eras and musical tracks-- the rich production on ""Dreamin' of You"" is a gothic heat-haze; the brisk ""Tell Ol' Bill"" conjures the bone-rattling spirit of Tom Waits-- but it holds the set together with mordant wit, making the record far more than a grab-bag. <br/><br/>Listeners who bridle even at Dylan's 60s voice should, however, stay well away: This set shows the instrument in its progressive collapse into rheum and ruin. But only in terms of tone: When it comes to fitting voice to material, or threading the audience through a song, or capturing a lifetime's lessons in a twist of inflection, he's still one of the world's best. Take the outstanding ""Red River Shore"", for instance: Dylan's voice is a halting croak throughout this tale of obsessive, mystical love, but his phrasing is impeccable, comfortable switching from the high-flown to the vernacular in the space of a line, and drifting between emphatic certainty and querulous doubt as it becomes clear that the girl-- or Dylan himself-- may be a spectre. As the stately Latin music swells and strengthens, Dylan weakens, and by the song's end he sounds older than ever. <br/><br/>Of course, Dylan has a vested interest in sounding ancient: The last 15 years have seen him re-engaging not just with his own craft, but with the roots and history of American song, becoming one of its most prominent flame-keepers with his ""Theme Time Radio Hour"" show. My favorite track of all here is a tender reading of a Jimmie Rodgers tune, ""Miss the Mississippi"", gentle and direct in its sentiment: Dylan has never been afraid to be corny when it suits him. And the debt his own music owes to the past has never been clearer: Sometimes on <em>Tell Tale Signs</em> he comes on like a broke-down transmitter, singing in epigrams, the disconnected and cryptic verses he's always used sounding like snippets of a thousand imaginary old-time songs. Nourishing and engrossing in a way a Greatest Hits album couldn't be, <em>Tell Tale Signs</em> is a testament to Bob Dylan's love of music as well as his continued mastery in crafting it.</p></div>"|12330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12330-the-bootleg-series-vol-8-tell-tale-signs-rare-and-unreleased-1986-2006/|8.6|Tom Ewing

Owe your label one last album, but are locked in arguments with your bandmates, imprisoned by writer's block, or don't want to waste your great new material on them? Just record from the sound board one night at the club, and-- presto!-- you've fulfilled your obligations. Luckily Glasgow's Frightened Rabbit are one of the few bands that earn such an indulgence. They have proven, in the course of their brief career, that they are definitely not slackers; their first two albums, <em>Sing the Greys</em> and <em>Midnight Organ Fight</em>, were released within a year of each other. And though <em>Lung! Liver! FR!</em>, which was recorded at a hometown gig in July, includes neither new songs nor any track from their charming 2007 debut, it succeeds at stripping down and speeding up <em>Organ Fight</em>'s songs, closing the gap between the band's more mannered studio image and their sweaty, raw live one.<br/><br/>On their studio albums, Frightened Rabbit's charismatic, bass-free folk rock is sadly scathing but always pleasantly rousing, and their catchy acoustic melodies soften the jagged edges of their songs. They express their aggression instead through the frisson in their acoustic and electric guitar interplay. Live, however, the lyrical bitterness is unadorned, the electric guitars mostly ignored. James Graham from the Twilight Sad joins the band to sing ""Keep Yourself Warm"", and when he wails ""It takes more than fucking someone to keep yourself warm,"" there is a desperation in his quivering voice. Though the arrangements haven't changed much-- sacred/sad organs still whirr in the background, but instead of the fuzzy, belligerent embrace of a crashing electric guitar, an acoustic thrums with insistent melancholy-- the overall feeling is more urgent. And though lines like ""Jesus is just a Spanish boy's name/ How come one man got so much fame?"" (from ""Heads Roll Off"") always had a provocative power, bled of the original's rocking guitar chug, the audible catch in singer Scott Hutchison's throat makes him sound more sorrowful than smart-assy. <br/><br/>The drumming of Grant Hutchison (Scott's brother) is a throbbing, muscular base, but live, the rich thump of his kick drum has a surprising musicality. On some tracks you can hear just how hard he plays, and on others he offers nuance that gooses the emotion in his brother's carpal tunnel-inducing strum. Billy Kennedy's keyboard parts, used in the studio to fill out the rhythm section, have added importance here, whether taking on the guise of a hollow synthesizer, an ethereal organ, or a mournful piano. Stripped of their guitar jangle, these songs are left with their exposed nerves, aching delivery, and rhythmic heaviness, which makes the keys a welcome melodic guide through this collection. <br/><br/>Though there is a newfound vitality to the live incarnations of these tracks, many may wonder what is the point of basically re-buying <em>Midnight Organ Fight</em> with added cheering-crowd sounds. The hope is that, for fans, this album imbues added depth to the familiar songs, bringing out their bruised sentiment and illustrating Frightened Rabbit's power as a live band. (Although Ross Cook's mandolin on ""Old Old Fashioned"" lends this album the air of a local hootenanny.) But for those who missed Frightened Rabbit's last record, those who weren't already enthralled by these tuneful Scots, this album will really come alive. After all, for those listeners, these 12 tracks are new and, therefore, essential.</p></div>"|12293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12293-liver-lung-fr/|6.9|Rebecca Raber

They're still stubbornly reconstructing punk anthems from the same raw parts-- Dan Friel's wheezing, bagpipe-reminding keyboards chiefly among them-- but building something bigger, from stronger foundations. They aim for tension and nuance where they'd previously shouted and bludgeoned (not that anyone minded the bludgeoning, of course) and their tables of broken toys sound like tidal waves of melody and sound.</p><p>Of course, another essential part of their sound was the machine-man pummeling of drummer Christopher R. Weingarten, who has since left the band. Rather than fill his spot with more brute force, Joe Wong takes a relatively less-is-more approach, and Sarah Lipstate joins them on guitar with often clean, spacious playing that makes an auspicious contribution to these nine songs. ""Satellites"" is driven by a bright recurring mechanical tone, the rhythm of a one-chord guitar strum, and a voice that doesn't bellow or bark, but actually sings. The familiar 8-bit buzz of the keyboards bring in a counter-melody, the harmonies kick in and reach for the highest registers. If it isn't clear how ""big"" the band are going, all of it falls together for the second verse-- especially when the song builds to a towering unstable coda and finally evaporates into a minute of placid, layered static.<br/><br/>""Nowheres Nigh"" is just as strikingly clean and ambitious, with a similar reach in vocals-- to be frank, neither of these guys are understudies for the Three Tenors, but BJ Warshaw confidently sells his vocals here and there's more than enough texture in these songs to comb over the thin parts. ""Mount Misery"" finds a way better vehicle for Dan Friel's croon, borrowing some more evocative theremin-aping electronics from his recent (and excellent) solo record as well as a damn-near folky guitar pluck from Lipstate, all over a half-time skipping rhythm. It's a big change for the band, but it works just as well as its busted-robot hardcore did on their previous two albums. Parts follow it up with their best curveball-- the slow simmer of ""The Ceasing Now"", replete with mechanical handclaps-- and save their boldest new material for the album's final three tracks.<br/><br/>It's not just more harmonies or more fun noises that they've piled on: Nothing on previous records compares to the wheeze and full-band crash on the chorus of ""Wedding in a Wasteland"" or the grinding, clattering crescendo of ""Prefix Free""-- not to mention the fake-out that stretches the tension rather than merely exploding. They've tried all these things before to some degree, but just not in songs as layered, dynamic, or delivered with such a steady hand. It's hard to predict where they'll go from here when <em>Receivers</em> sounds as if they've stretched their favorite sonic ideas to the very brink of saturation-- but no one could have guessed they'd take them quite this far.</p></div>"|12323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12323-receivers/|8.1|Jason Crock

It's actually refreshing, then, to hear a record like Raphael Saadiq's unabashedly retro <em>The Way I See It</em>, which doesn't try to ""update"" old soul sounds to a hip-hop world and a white singer. Instead, the former Tony! Toni! Ton√©! frontman works under the simple belief that those styles created in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Memphis during the 1960s speak as loudly now as they did then. They don't need to be revived, resurrected, retrofitted, or revitalized. They just need to be played.</p><p>So Saadiq, an artist whose career has failed to match his considerable talents, self-produces <em>The Way I See It</em> to sound out of time. Playing almost all the instruments, he keeps the drums taut, the basslines rubbery, and makes sure the tambourine remains a vital component of the rhythm section. His tightly wound guitar on ""Staying in Love"" even recalls his early New Jack Swing riffs (see: ""If I Had No Loot""). The album starts rockily, however, with ""Sure Hope You Mean It"", a clever rewrite of ""How Sweet It Is"" that suffers from a bad mix. Against Saadiq's exuberant delivery (he's a superlatively smooth vocalist), the percussion sounds slightly off-beat: The tambourine shakes before hitting on the beat, creating an audio illusion of being too fast, while the snare rolls into the verses sound too slow, like they've been manipulated from a faster performance. As a result, the song sound like it's forever winding down, then struggling to correct itself. It's a curious opener, technically flawed but conceptually solid right down to the distant yoo-hoo's.</p><p>Fortunately, ""100 Yard Dash"" rights things quickly, sounding appropriately dashed off. Sex and social issues commingle on <em>The Way I See It</em>, with playfully physical songs like ""Dash"", ""Just One Kiss"", and ""Let's Take a Walk"" (sample lyric: ""Love can happen anywhere"") alongside fare like ""Keep Marchin'"" and ""Big Easy"". The latter, obviously, is about Katrina and features the Rebirth Brass Band, yet Saadiq makes no larger point than WTF, capping an uptempo chorus with a massive question mark: ""Someone please tell me what's going on,"" he sings, echoing Marvin Gaye but sounding right this very moment as the horns blare around him. It's immensely affecting without hitting you over the head.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he road-trips to Philly for the lushly orchestrated ""Just One Kiss"" (with Joss Stone kept in check) and ""Oh Girl"", which cuts a big slice out of the Stylistics' ""Betcha By Golly Wow"". The cloud cushion of strings and slow-moving sitar-sounding riff come across as overly curatorial, but the bonus version of the song sounds much better for sounding so modern, thanks to Jay-Z's pointed rhythms and verbal shadow-boxing. I can't tell you a thing about what Jay-Z raps about, and he probably left the studio before the second verse, but he opens up the song quite a bit, making it less dependent on its source material. Still, few artists live so vitally in the past as Saadiq.</p></div>"|12301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12301-the-way-i-see-it/|6.8|Stephen M. Deusner

Since then, he's largely focused on the Howling Hex, a prolific, rambling rock project currently based in New Mexico that features a revolving cast of musicians, the only constant being Hagerty himself. Over the last five years, the group's nine albums have been adventurous, if at times distracted, experiments that inject conventional songwriting formulas with the sort of playful absurdity and nihilism that Hagerty's been trading in since his days with Pussy Galore in the 1980s.</p><p>The Howling Hex's latest record, <em>Earth Junk</em>, has many qualities that invite the listener's attention and suggest great musical possibility: there's a general ambience of late-60s psych that runs throughout the album, both in the tone of the recording and in the spiky, upfront guitar lines which are pleasingly reminiscent of the Zombies. The band also effectively adopts the Hammond organ as the dominant percussive instrument, which relaxes the need for proper drums in the manner of Suicide while giving the music a nice spaciousness and melodic breathing room. Combined with a deficiency of actual hooks, however, the lack of a beat ends up taking its toll, leading to forgettable songs and giving the record an overly linear feel. Fortunately, Hagerty's proficiency as a songwriter is revealed in his guitar playing, which always features heavily on Howling Hex recordings and introduces color and dynamic spark to the rough bagginess of the song structures.</p><p>Opening the album with whined lyrics like ""ring-a-ding-ding"" and ""rama tam tama"" does not bode well for what is to come. There is something deeply irritating about Hagerty's voice on this album; it sounds overtly affected, as though he's trying to emulate the vocal style of the type of baroque pop that has clearly influenced this record while falling awkwardly short. Luckily, this is balanced out by the reverb-saturated, soulful vocals of Eleanor Whitmore on tracks such as ""Annie Get Redzy"". She also takes the lead on ""Faithful Sister"" and ""Contraband &amp; Betrayal"", and indeed, the tracks she sings on are generally the strongest. When Whitmore's voice is paired with the playful, honky-tonk keys, the music often strikes common ground with the Fiery Furnaces, though it lacks the taunt weave and quick-wink smartness that makes that band so intriguing.</p>
<p>The back of the album artwork shows a photograph of Hagerty's face, beside which the track listing is split in two, possibly suggesting that the album is open to being seen in two parts. Certainly it seems that way, as from middle track ""No Good Reason"" onwards, the songwriting becomes more enjoyable, such as the bluesy, spaced out craziness of ""Blood &amp; Dust"". Still, these later highlights are not enough to recommend the album at as a whole. At just over 33 minutes, <em>Earth Junk</em> is a short recording, but even at that length, the limited sonic range and repetitive tricks are ultimately draining.</p></div>"|12302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12302-earth-junk/|4.5|Mia Clarke

Last year's <em>Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</em> was so rich with cathartic pop goodness it's easy to forget Barnes supposedly morphed into a middle-aged African-American transsexual midway through the album. And he hasn't yet changed back. Longtime fans still hoping for a return to <em>The Gay Parade</em> or <em>Cherry Peel</em> days of innocence may want to stop reading, because <em>Skeletal Lamping</em> roofies <em>Hissing Fauna</em>'s back half to live out Barnes', er, Georgie's sexual fantasies.<br/><br/>However, the story with<em> Skeletal Lamping</em> isn't Barnes' role playing, but its relentlessly schizophrenic composition. Although broken into 15 tracks, the album seems like nearly an hour of song fragments. The pop hooks are still there, but like the similarly kaleidoscopic material of the Fiery Furnaces or even Girl Talk, <em>Skeletal Lamping</em> can be utterly exhausting, even at its most fun-loving. <br/><br/>The album starts harmlessly with the fractured but hummable one-two punch of ""Nonpareil of Favor"" and ""Wicked Wisdom"" before ""For Our Elegant Caste""-- which contains one of the most annoying choruses of the year-- kicks off the album's convoluted middle section. Excepting the 90-second Elton John coke crash ""Touched Something's Hollow"", this middle portion whips the listener through a rollercoaster of orgasms, hangovers, and euphoria, leaving no time in between for a breather. Georgie's funk persona-- he played in a 70s funk band named Arousal apparently-- feels most apropos on the Prince bedroom ballad ""St. Exquisite's Confessions"", but the laidback tempo doesn't allow Barnes to spew his typical 100 hooks per minute, making the track his most by-the-numbers genre hop.<br/><br/>The brief teases of Barnes' melodic mastery will probably frustrate even more than <em>Lamping</em>'s clunkers. Single ""Id Engager"" closes the album on a surprisingly carefree note, concluding the twisted sexual odyssey with the one song that could've passed prima facie on <em>Hissing Fauna</em>. The stunning chorus on ""Plastis Wafers"" meanders through disco and cock rock with equal grace, but requires the listener to suffer wandering passages that help push the track over seven minutes. ""Wicked Wisdom"" finds Georgie not yet a full-blown lothario, and his sympathetic naivet√©, whether lamenting his struggles to connect with girls or flaunting his puppy love, is reinforced by gumball hooks ranging from power-pop to psychedelic melodrama.<br/><br/>Ultimately <em>Skeletal Lamping </em>registers as a misstep, but not without loads of silver lining. For one, Kevin Barnes has established himself as the anti-Christ to the polite, erudite indie world, and for all this album's shortcomings, it's a breath of fresh air for those bored by ivory tower indie rock. For that matter, with an overblown live show replete with costume changes, skits, video screens, etc., Of Montreal's hardly pretending to be an album-oriented act anymore, making <em>Lamping</em> feel like a soundtrack to a much more interesting movie. Coming off his magnum opus, it's understandable Barnes takes a victory lap here, but his mad genius-- no matter how outwardly freewheeling and escapist-- sounds better wrung through some semblance of a conventional pop filter.</p></div>"|12328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12328-skeletal-lamping/|5.9|Adam Moerder

A lot of people were hurt, even pissed. That sort of jealous guarding of lo-fi sensibilities seems more rare today: Another Scottish band, Glasvegas, recently parlayed some scrappy, excellent singles into a major-label album, then hired Muse's producer and still got a 9/10 from the <em>NME</em>.</p><p>But a lot of people who got excited about the Long Blondes' four early singles in the middle of this decade were let down by their debut LP, <em>Someone to Drive You Home</em>. Perhaps the disappointment stemmed in part from the dearth of these sort of handmade, indie throwbacks in the UK these days-- bands with a keen sense of history, who still associate indie with things like 7""s (or button badges, or John Peel) in the first place. (Though maybe with a group like Los Campesinos! around that's loosening up a bit.) It could also, however, have been simply some heel-digging from people who missed the rawness and jagged edges of those early tracks, which became buffed and shined a bit on the album.</p><p>From a band as stylish and keenly aware of how to put themselves together as the Long Blondes, it's no real surprise though that they took advantage of the opportunity to pretty up their songs-- though that sheen has overwhelmed their more unique and appealing qualities on this year's Erol Alkan-produced <em>""Couples""</em>. No such shine exists on the compilation <em>""Singles""</em>. Of the dozen songs here, only three appeared on their debut album-- ""Giddy Stratospheres"", ""Lust in the Movies"", ""Separated By Motorways""-- and these versions are, on the whole, a bit more appealing. ""Giddy"", in particular, when stretched to almost five minutes, prolongs and heightens the pent-up sexual frustration in the song. Elsewhere, I would have sworn when first looking at this tracklist that ""Autonomy Boy"" and ""Appropriation (By Any Other Name)"" had made the debut-- they're among the band's top-tier songs.</p>
<p>Each of those two is cut more from ""Giddy""'s cloth rather than hewing close to short, sharp stuff like ""Motorways"" (heard here in demo form). Singer Kate Jackson excels on each when given the room to move around in a song, stretch her syllables a bit, get comfortable within a sonic space, and let her words and theatrical delivery do the work. On many of these early songs, she functions best like that, as she slowly develops and clicks into the persona that worked so well on <em>Someone</em>. She's best when she flits between wizened observer, buzzing like a queen bee taking stock of a scene's sexual and social politics, and home alone wishing she was doing something-- anything-- else. It's a familiar dichotomy-- a catty front to mask her characters' own sense of emptiness-- and she pulls it off with a hard, detached exterior and a soft, vulnerable core.</p>
<p>Other early songs skirt closer to rote exercise (the girl-group of ""Polly"", the lo-fi sloganeering of ""New Idols"", the pub-rock of ""Darts"", the jangle pop of ""My Heart Is Out of Bounds""), with a few glimpses of the more fully-formed band in place to make them more interesting than they'd otherwise be. Still, the Long Blondes were at their best when Jackson-- IMing in the pub on her own, lamenting a night in, or lording it over a night out-- is the clear focus, navigating the world of aging hipsterdom like a UK companion to James Murphy or Craig Finn.  All three writers are storytellers, but Jackson better crystallizes a specific persona, and in that way the Jarvis Cocker comparisons are dead on-- the more she encapsulates the post-internet indie queen fighting not to cede ground to the kids coming up from behind, the more compelling she is. And with a new generation of those UK kids possibly galvanized by Los Campesinos! and again hooked on the ephemera and attitude of indiedom, perhaps this record-- a set of scrappy, charming indie songs that draw on traditions of great UK guitar pop-- will find a new, more appreciative audience.</p>
<p>Either way, this is alas a bittersweet coda to the Long Blondes story. Earlier this week, the group announced it was disbanding, four months after guitarist  Dorian Cox suffered a debilitating stroke. Cox, worried that he'd not be able to play guitar again, made the announcement himself on the group's MySpace on the day this record was released, tragically closing the book on the band just as listeners are given the chance to easily digest all of its recorded output.</p></div>"|12326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12326-singles/|7.4|Scott Plagenhoef

That space around which all the singers gather is, according to the documentary, the ideal place to hear this form of a cappella singing, where you can feel the full force of every voice in the room. The singers don't take a stage or stand in a loft, as they do in many churches. Rather, the choir becomes the congregation, the performers their own audience. Sacred Harp singing-- or shape-note singing, as it is often called-- is not performative or presentational, but participatory and communal, and to hear these songs from your stereo speakers or ear buds is to experience only a fraction of the music's power. Or, as filmmaker Matt Hinton writes in the liner notes to the <em>Awake, My Soul</em>¬≠ soundtrack, ""A Sacred Harp <em>recording</em> may be the light, but a Sacred Harp <em>singing</em> is the sun.""<br/><br/>Despite that intrinsic shortcoming, the soundtrack nevertheless sounds revelatory and exultant, dense with harmonic ideas and often overwhelming even on CD. Sacred Harp singing is spiritual music, but despite its name and the circumstances of its practice, there is no scriptural imperative for this style of singing, aside from the Biblical admonition to ""Seek the old paths and walk therein""-- a verse printed in the Sacred Harp hymnal. Its authority is primarily historical, with roots in the settlement of the American colonies and the consequent spread of singing schools and itinerant music teachers. During the 1800s, a composer named B.F. White developed a musical technology that employed only four notes of the seven-note scale-- fa, sol, la, and mi-- which he represented on the page with different shapes. Hence the name shape-note singing.<br/><br/>The soundtrack consists of recordings made between 1998 and 2006 at rural churches in Georgia and Alabama. Many begin with a verse sung only in syllables, creating a dense swarm of harmony from which melodies and lyrics arise. Some you may be familiar with: I sang ""Jordan, 66"" innumerable times growing up in a Southern Baptist church, but I knew the song as ""There Is a Land of Pure Delight"". And everyone knows ""New Britain, 45t"" as ""Amazing Grace"", which the Liberty Baptist Church singers in Henegar, Alabama, manage to render freshly captivating.<span>¬† </span>Many of these recordings are straightforward, showcasing full, clean notes with no vibrato or slurs, but they are never simple. ""Stratfield, 142"" and ""America, 36t"" sound like chants, only more emphatic and excited, and the soundtrack contains several examples of fuguing songs, including the moving ""Russia, 107"", which set the singers in a roundelay to create intricate rhythms and harmonies.<br/><br/>Sacred Harp singing is not only one of the country's earliest indigenous musical traditions, but in clearly rejecting European refinements, it is an essentially American style, favoring populism rather than exceptionalism. Singers sing together, with no soloist nor accompaniment of any kind. Even in the rigid strictures of these shaped notes, there are, however, occasional opportunities for self-expression. On the incredibly raucous ""Bear Creek, 269"", a lone alto soars an octave above the harmonies, ecstatic in praise and music-making. So don't mistake the music's historical weight for for a duty-bound listen or a scholarly undertaking: As music heard well outside the hollow square, the recordings can be powerful and moving. To quote the popular hymn, this soundtrack has its own ten thousand charms.<br/><br/>Accompanying <em>Awake, My Soul</em> is a second disc titled <em>Help Me to Sing</em>, on which contemporary musicians offer their own interpretations of Sacred Harp songs. They are largely and inevitably more subdued, and thankfully so. Attempts to mimic too literally the abandon of actual Sacred Harp singings would surely ring false. Rather than emphasizing performance, <em>Help Me to Sing</em> focuses on the songs themselves, historical documents that in some cases predate the Declaration of Independence, yet still sound viable today.<br/><br/>A tribute album by default, <em>Help Me to Sing</em> opens and closes with the otherworldly, sinner-in-crisis drone of ""Blooming Youth, 176b"" by Rayna Gellert and John Paul Jones and ""Bound for Canaan, 82b"" by Old 97s bass player Murry Hammond. In between are a variety of interpretations and musical settings, some dutifully reverent and others slightly freer. The Innocence Mission's ""Africa, 178"" and Liz Janes' ""Abbeville, 33b"" sound hushed and liturgical, as if singing might be a form of personal prayer, and Jim Lauderdale (who narrates the documentary) creates what might be called a low lonesome sound on ""The Christian's Hope, 134"". On the other hand, Elvis Perkins in Dearland and the Good Players re-create the spirit of Sacred Harp singing with different means-- namely, rock instruments-- and toward different ends, while Tenement Halls (featuring Hinton on guitar) rework ""Essay, 157"" into a rambunctious rocker and All Things Bright &amp; Beautiful's ""China, 163b"" builds and builds but never resolves, the journey being much more important than the destination.<br/><br/>Largely, the more subdued songs carry more power. Sam Amidon's ""Kedron, 48b"" has a sackcloth-humble arrangement featuring only a ragged electric guitar, which suits his bent voice ideally, and DM Stith's ""Christian's Farewell, 347"" needs only an ethereal choir for accompaniment. By contrast, the menacing bass vocal on Richard Buckner's ""Windham 38b"" comes across as cartoonish and Woven Hand's sinister ""Consecration, 448t"" just sounds hammy. But the most telling moment on <em>Help Me to Sing</em> comes in the transition between Danielson's gloriously strange, if curiously withdrawn ""Sermon on the Mount, 507"" and Doc Watson's homey performance of ""Am I Born to Die?, Idumea 47b"" That segue-- from orchestrated to merely accompanied, from public to personal-- reveals the durability and versatility of these old songs. They can convey any emotion, support any reading, and inspire in any setting.¬†</p></div>"|12315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12315-awake-my-soul-the-original-soundtrack-help-me-to-sing-songs-of-the-sacred-harp/|8.8|Stephen M.

Relocation hasn't had a perceptible effect on Meluch's DIY M.O.-- not yet, anyway. Even if <em>Temper</em>'s opener ""Ragged Tint"" deploys a more aggressive, even violent, guitar figure than anything found on <em>Pr</em><em>√©</em><em>cis</em>, the albums are for the most part woven of similar strands of instrument and machine, pop and art, beauty and noise. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, location-- or, rather, dislocation-- seems to remain one of the project's core concerns. Meluch never has, to my knowledge, satisfactorily explained his French-inflected pseudonym (it, uh, came to him in a dream) and it's mighty tempting to write it off, along with his conspicuous song titles, as student pretension (he just recently graduated from college). The name does, however, plant a few helpful signposts to Europe and critics are, unsurprisingly, fond of comparing Beno√Æt Pioulard with Fennesz, Four Tet, Boards of Canada, and any handy Gallic laptop act. Considering Meluch's slack enunciation and pretty much incomprehensible (English) lyrics, he might as well be singing in French (or Italian or Serbo-Croatian). Then again, Zach Baron's Pitchfork review of <em>Pr</em><em>√©</em><em>cis</em> makes just as compelling a case for Beno√Æt Pioulard's kinship with state-siders Brightblack Morning Light and Califone.<br/><br/>Hell, I'll point north. Droning interludes ""Ardoise"", ""Sweep Generator"", and the mournful cello-lined ""Tapyre""-- plus the way many of Meluch's flatly sung melodies slip their instrumental and found-sound shells gently, as if by accident-- resemble a folkier, less geeky version of Dan Snaith's Manitoba and early Caribou work. ""Golden Grin""'s archaic-sounding tune could be a afterthought to the fuzzy noise collage that precedes it, as if Meluch left a recorder in the woods and happened to capture a passing hiker's song. <em>Temper</em> offers a few straight pop pieces (""Ahn"" and ""Idyll""), that plop vocals at the fore and recognize other conventional mixing hierarchies. But in ""Physic"" and ""The Loom Pedal"", Meluch's tamped-down voice enjoys no more authority than the guitar arpeggios, shuffling beats, or tape hiss. Like the album art's diffused light Polaroids, its music remains sonically and spacially uncertain.<br/><br/>However disparate its geographic points of reference, <em>Temper</em> is an artistically consistent, tonally <em>temper</em>ate, record--¬† depending on your taste, maybe a little too balmy and dispassionate. If Meluch's lost anything on recent journeys, it isn't his fondness for wrapping yearning expansiveness in snug, even stifling, intimacy. ""A Woolgathering Exodus"", the album's lushest track, pulses with psychedelic, mind-expanding keys chords even as Meluch's voice implies that he's on the verge of nodding off before the fire. He doesn't have to decide between engagement or non-: The song fizzles out in static.</p></div>"|12329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12329-temper/|6.8|Amy Granzin

The songs of Shinji Shibayama and partner Masako Takeda's play like a Zen Buddhist's tribute to the Beatles-- clean guitar chords are slowly strummed and lyrics take the form of austere pop-haiku meditatons on love, nature, and love-amidst-nature. <i>Yosuga</i>, the duo's seventh album and first release in roughly four years, not only adheres to the formula, but strips things down even further.</p>
<p>Founded in 1992, Nagisa Ni Te (the name translates to On the Beach) has always been a couple's band, a songwriting outlet based on the relationship between Shibayama and long-time girlfriend Takeda. A revolving cast of backing musicians helped to flesh things out and the band often skewed into hushed psychedelic territory not too far removed from hippie-dippy peers like Ghost or Magic Hour. At the very least, you got a few guitar solos. But although Nagisa Ni Te's social circle hasn't slimmed-- a few friends fill in on bass and lead guitar-- Shibayama and Takeda seem to have <i>Yosuga </i>all to themselves. The spontaneity and collective vibe of previous efforts like <i>On the Love Beach</i> is largely absent. Even the production-- lacking in room resonance or reverb-- seems hermetically sealed from the outside world. This time Nagisa Ni Te are on the beach all by themselves.</p>
<p>Album opener ""Premonition"" is <i>Yosuga</i>'s single truly energetic moment, and it's still pretty laid back. The sound of chirping birds gives way to low-key love-rock with Shibayama and Takeda strumming simple chords over bubbling organ figures. Almost all of the album's lyrics are in Japanese (""Premonition"" has a chorus in English) and it's hard to fully appreciate <i>Yosuga</i>'s songs without reading the translations in the liner notes. Judging by the guitar figures and melodies alone, ""Seeing the Sea"" sounds rather mournful and dour. But closer inspection reveals a sexier intent: ""I want to strip you even more naked/ More, harder/ Meeting melting.""</p>
<p>Most of <i>Yosuga</i> plays like a conversation between lovers-- which is ostensibly what it is. Shibayama and Takeda trade phrases, answer each other's melodies, and sing the choruses in blissed-out unison. But halfway through the album-- which runs a seemingly eternal 70 minutes-- this intimacy starts to feel a bit awkward and claustrophobic. With spare instrumentation, ascetic melodies, and a pace that's positively glacial, there's little to fuel <i>Yosuga</i> but the intensity of Nagisa Ni Te's affections. On songs like the album's title track that intimacy is so pronounced that one can't help but feel like an outsider-- a bothersome third wheel on somebody else's hot date. While that often makes for lovely and sweetly innocent listening, it also demands a lot of patience.</p></div>"|12273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12273-yosuga/|5.8|Aaron Leitko

He trembles through quiet moments like he's straining for warmth in winter, and rattles through loud ones like a revving engine. His voice isn't just the center of the Mountain Goats, it's their essence. This is a liability as often as it is an asset: Of the people I know who hate his music, the first explanations are always that ""the singing is annoying"" and ""I don't care about the words."" His scenarios are suffused with confusion and dread. His best characters' tragic flaw is benign faith in ventures doomed to spectacular failure. But he uses songs to order and explicate messes, not mimic them. In his music, meth-heads and abused teenagers-- types not known for their lucidity-- speak in complete sentences. And they come through Darnielle's tough, reedy, persistent voice. Trying to define his songs as happy or sad is irrelevant, because intensity-- real, immolating intensity-- is neither.</p>
<p>But Darnielle has given his voice a rest in the past few years. And in the absence of urgency, is space to reflect. Songs like <i>The Sunset Tree</i>'s ""Song for Dennis Brown"" or ""Love, Love, Love"", <i>Get Lonely</i>'s ""In Corolla"", or <i>Heretic Pride</i>'s ""Marduk T-Shirt Incident"" sound different than anything he's ever done before, and sometimes, better. I think some fans hear this as a weakness-- Darnielle's exemplary moments carry the same grace and power to his fans as a well-set blastbeat does to the metalhead.</p>
<p>Two new EPs-- <i>Satanic Messiah</i>, limited to 666 vinyl copies and offered as a pay-what-you-will release <b><a href=""http://www.satanicmessiah.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></b>, and <i>Black Pear Tree</i>-- present Darnielle in ways we've never heard him before: With distinct, independent supporting actors (the pointillistic, vivid guitar work of Kaki King); and solo, with piano. And their best moments are the clearest articulations of the progress he's made as a performer-- someone who no longer needs to mime hysteria to show he really means it.</p>
<p><i>Satanic Messiah</i>, the piano-heavy set, has a pious, meditative quality to it. The ease of his performances disconnects them from the violence of his lyrics. But it also reinforces them-- moments that Darnielle might've throttled in the past take on sanctity and earthiness; by taking a calm hand to a volatile situation, Darnielle bronzes the moment.</p>
<p>Two songs, ""Satanic Messiah"" and ""Sarcofago Live"", assume the vantage point of a fan seeing a band. The first is one of the best in his catalog: Direct in vocabulary and elliptical in narrative, with a sentiment that shifts its weight from anthem to depth charge. He compares a rock star to a prophet, and delivers the moment with a quiet dignity reserved for church. Even as an obvious proponent of music's power-- his onstage quaking is a wrench in the mind-body duality argument-- this is a gamble. But when Darnielle extends the same tenderness to disenfranchised Ethiopians murdering tax collectors in ""Gojam Province 1968"", he renews a commitment he's made for almost 20 years: Not giving a voice to the voiceless, exactly, but articulating the experience of people too possessed to know what to say.</p>

He trembles through quiet moments like he's straining for warmth in winter, and rattles through loud ones like a revving engine. His voice isn't just the center of the Mountain Goats, it's their essence. This is a liability as often as it is an asset: Of the people I know who hate his music, the first explanations are always that ""the singing is annoying"" and ""I don't care about the words."" His scenarios are suffused with confusion and dread. His best characters' tragic flaw is benign faith in ventures doomed to spectacular failure. But he uses songs to order and explicate messes, not mimic them. In his music, meth-heads and abused teenagers-- types not known for their lucidity-- speak in complete sentences. And they come through Darnielle's tough, reedy, persistent voice. Trying to define his songs as happy or sad is irrelevant, because intensity-- real, immolating intensity-- is neither.</p>
<p>But Darnielle has given his voice a rest in the past few years. And in the absence of urgency, is space to reflect. Songs like <i>The Sunset Tree</i>'s ""Song for Dennis Brown"" or ""Love, Love, Love"", <i>Get Lonely</i>'s ""In Corolla"", or <i>Heretic Pride</i>'s ""Marduk T-Shirt Incident"" sound different than anything he's ever done before, and sometimes, better. I think some fans hear this as a weakness-- Darnielle's exemplary moments carry the same grace and power to his fans as a well-set blastbeat does to the metalhead.</p>
<p>Two new EPs-- <i>Satanic Messiah</i>, limited to 666 vinyl copies and offered as a pay-what-you-will release <b><a href=""http://www.satanicmessiah.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></b>, and <i>Black Pear Tree</i>-- present Darnielle in ways we've never heard him before: With distinct, independent supporting actors (the pointillistic, vivid guitar work of Kaki King); and solo, with piano. And their best moments are the clearest articulations of the progress he's made as a performer-- someone who no longer needs to mime hysteria to show he really means it.</p>
<p><i>Satanic Messiah</i>, the piano-heavy set, has a pious, meditative quality to it. The ease of his performances disconnects them from the violence of his lyrics. But it also reinforces them-- moments that Darnielle might've throttled in the past take on sanctity and earthiness; by taking a calm hand to a volatile situation, Darnielle bronzes the moment.</p>
<p>Two songs, ""Satanic Messiah"" and ""Sarcofago Live"", assume the vantage point of a fan seeing a band. The first is one of the best in his catalog: Direct in vocabulary and elliptical in narrative, with a sentiment that shifts its weight from anthem to depth charge. He compares a rock star to a prophet, and delivers the moment with a quiet dignity reserved for church. Even as an obvious proponent of music's power-- his onstage quaking is a wrench in the mind-body duality argument-- this is a gamble. But when Darnielle extends the same tenderness to disenfranchised Ethiopians murdering tax collectors in ""Gojam Province 1968"", he renews a commitment he's made for almost 20 years: Not giving a voice to the voiceless, exactly, but articulating the experience of people too possessed to know what to say.</p>

Pouring the muffled art-beats of 2004's <em>Revival of the Shittest</em> and<em> </em>the extended space-jams of 2004's <em>Gang Gang Dance </em>into structured songs, the record was starry and dreamy, yet also taut and focused. It made evident what was implicit from the start-- that these four hyperactive talents with underground pedigrees (see the Cranium, SSAB Songs, Angelblood, et. al.) could funnel their ideas into melodic pop without diluting them.</p><p>It also suggested that Gang Gang Dance might become an all-out pop band. But three EPs since <em>God's Money </em>have defied such expectations. Though gems like ""Nicoman"" did surface, <em>Hillulah</em>, <em>Retina Riddim</em>, and <em>RAWWAR</em> were mostly mysterious experiments akin to the band's earlier releases. Not that any of them were anything less than good-- but none were the pop epiphany the band on <em>God's Money</em> seemed poised for.</p><p>It turns out they had been working on that all along, and with <em>Saint Dymphna </em>their patience pays off. So clear and shiny it makes <em>God's Money </em>seem murky by comparison, this<em> </em>is predominantly a relative dance-pop album. But it still sounds completely like Gang Gang Dance, preserving their core of new-wave synths, tribal beats, otherworldly singing, and Residents-style loops. The biggest difference this time around is a lack of cavernous atmospheres. Here every sound and beat is laid bare, with no heavy reverb blanketing the songs like fog. The newfound clarity produces neither thinness nor tedium, but simply a direct, unadulterated power.</p>
<p>That power is clear immediately, when opening instrumental ""Bebey"" melts into the rhapsodic ""First Communion"". Here Lizzi Bougatsos' dreamy poetry (""Prisms have kissed my lids/ Sea salt has rubbed on my hips"") and the band's coiled rhythms (particularly the beat-and-synth workouts of band MVP Brian DeGraw) hit on a momentum that could easily be the album's climax. But so many peaks pop up along <em>Saint Dymphna</em>'s continuous stream that it's tough to catalogue them all.</p>
<p>Two moments in particular show that the more Gang Gang Dance change, the more they stay the same. After a lengthy synth opening, ""Princes"" becomes an actual hip-hop song featuring a rap from Tinchy Stryder. Sure, it's slightly jarring to hear his pulsing cadence paired with Bougatsos' ethereal howls, but the band's familiar elements-- especially Josh Diamond's wiry guitar line-- fit snugly around him. Even more surprising is ""House Jam"", a gleeful rip-off of Madonna circa ""Holiday"". But put the track on repeat and you might be more surprised that you never realized how well Gang Gang Dance's sound could work as 80s disco-pop.</p>
<p><em>Saint Dymphna </em>ends with ""Dust"", a beatific instrumental that carries the band away like a magic carpet. Often when a group with avant-garde leanings flies close to the pop sun, the results can sound forced or off-key. But since accessible melodies have always bubbled beneath their music's surface, Gang Gang Dance's evolution sounds supremely logical. And anyone who thought that the cloudy sound of previous albums was a smokescreen should think again-- it turns out the band behind that curtain really is made up of wizards.</p></div>"|12324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12324-saint-dymphna/|8.5|Marc Masters

Since forming Religious Knives in 2005, the duo have released a slew of CD-Rs and cassettes, largely through their own Heavy Tapes imprint. Now, with the addition of percussionist Nate Nelson of Mouthus and bassist Todd Cavallo, they've been spreading their sonic rash through basement shows, living rooms, and the beat-up tape decks of noise enthusiasts.</p><p><em>The Door</em> was produced with long-time supporter and label owner Thurston Moore, and from the crawling guitar line of early track ""Basement Watch"", it suggests a considerably more melodic, traditionally structured album than one might expect considering the ear-splitting frenzy of their previous releases. Of course, this is all relative: <em>The Door</em> is still firmly in a field of its own, offering six tracks that are equal in barbed psychedelic power yet compliment one another in such a way that this album-- although brief by the clock-- feels substantial, fully-realized, and bizarrely anthemic.</p><p>Stretching the sinews of their sound almost to the breaking point, Religious Knives find a balance between the repetitive rhythmic skeleton of krautrock and the psychedelic keyboard thrusts of early Doors. The band's collective attunement to the finer elements of noise turns out to be an ideal complement to their songwriting skills, particularly because they use abrasiveness sparingly and wisely-- just barely peaking through, yet always present. As vocalists, Miller and Bernstein wrestle against each other in tough monotones; Miller has shadows of Grace Slick burning beneath her dark tones, and, combined with Bernstein's hollowed-out baritone, it's gloriously menacing when they sing lines such as ""Where does it come from/ The feeling you get when you want to hold back nothing/ Your eyes are weapons in broad daylight/ Your fists are iron fucking arrows/ Control is lost"" on ""Decisions Are Made"".</p>
<p><em>The Door</em> builds up in intensity as its course develops. The opening tracks ""Basement Watch"" and live improvisation ""Downstairs"" have the same lurking energy that characterizes the album, but ""Major Score"" slithers down into a dripping mess, upending the distinction between keyboards and guitars while riding the distortion hot enough to have shades of the Black Angels. By the time ""On a Drive"" rolls around, the listener is lead even further through the group's murky waters, as a bare-boned drum patterns set the pace for Bernstein's tale of midnight beach wandering and a flood of gloomy fuzz. Religious Knives have said that their aim with this album is to capture the feeling of Brooklyn's streets, and <em>The Door </em>does indeed sound as though their music is reflecting off concrete. Or being burned into it.</p></div>"|12312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12312-the-door/|7.7|Mia Lily Clarke

She released her first solo album in 1995, after spending a few years in Thee Headcoatees; since then, she has kept up a steady pace of new material, at least one of these per year: singles comps, odd and ends packages, live shows, and (oh yeah) traditional albums. That rate of production often seems crucial to the palatability of her new old-timey music, preventing her from overthinking her songs or her performances while keeping everything loose and tossed off. As a result, she sounds a lot less manicured and a lot more convincing than upstarts like Langhorne Slim or Scott H. Biram.</p><p>In fact, writing on her web site, she sounds almost apologetic explaining that it took five days to record <em>Dirt Don't Hurt</em>, her second collaboration with the Brokeoffs. Their previous effort, <em>You Can't Buy a Gun When You're Crying</em> (which, you have to admit, is useful advice), was wrapped up in four days. And while she does admit ""it may seem a little over-produced to some!"" Golightly hasn't gone all Dave Fridmann on us: That extra day doesn't ruin the antique luster of her songs, but just focuses the collection considerably. It's still a heartily ramshackle affair, with pots and pans for percussion, rudimentary banjo picking, and what sound like first take on every track. The album's clattery rawness is its chief appeal.</p><p>Some explanation may be required: The Brokeoffs isn't a real backing band, as the pluralized name might suggest. Instead, it's just some dude named Lawyer Dave, who has been playing upright bass for Golightly for about a decade now. He provides the clatter, even sings in a cough on menacing opener ""Bottom Below"". Their sandpaper and satin voices blend nicely on the country lament ""Up Off the Floor"" and they imbue ""Indeed You Do"" and ""Slow Road"" with a folksy eeriness that lurches and claws at the recriminating lyrics. The slapdash ""Gettin' High for Jesus"" puts the pot in pots-and-pans. A Holly/Lawyer original, it could be a cover of some late-60s hippie novelty hit by, say, Country Joe &amp; the Fish.</p>
<p>At times <em>Dirt Don't Hurt</em> gets away from them: The clamor becomes grating (the demonstrative metal smacks that kick off (""Three Times Under""), the murder-and-mayhem storytelling sounds like dress-up (""My 45""), and the duo risk the sort of preciousness that sinks some of their sepia-toned peers (the clucks and bocks on ""Cluck Old Hen""). But more often than not, they make virtues of these shortcomings, as on the closer ""I Wanna Hug Ya, Kiss Ya, Squeeze Ya"". This Claudia Swann cover ought to sound unbearably saccharine, but thanks to the rumbling electric guitar and Holly and Lawyer's Mickey &amp; Sylvia vocal trade-offs, it's the album's highlight-- the reconciliation after all the bickering-- underscoring how well the duo play old songs as if they wrote them and write new songs that sound decades old.</p></div>"|12308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12308-dirt-dont-hurt/|7.0|Stephen M.

But since that auspicious debut, Grubbs has spent most of his time racing away from his punk roots as fast as possible, most prominently in Gastr del Sol (particularly in partnership with Jim O'Rourke) and later through a number of idiosyncratic, sometimes inscrutable solo records. Talk about post-rock: objects in Grubbs' rearview are receding so fast, they're barely a blip.</p><p>Grubbs' solo discs have touched on genres like folk and country, but mostly as subjects for subtle deconstruction. In fact, ""Gethsemani Night"", the first track off of <em>An Optimist Notes the Dusk</em>, Grubbs' first solo album in four years, could pass for folk were it not for his trademark use of space, pauses, dissonance, and unpredictable sing-song melodies. Then again, maybe it is folk despite this, just folk dissected while looking through the wrong end of the microscope. Certainly there's a bucolic feel to the track, and while Nate Wooley's trumpet as often as not sounds like a scratched string instrument rather than a horn, it may as well be the wind blowing outside the window on a particularly blustery day.</p><p>This open, airy theme continues through even the most insular tracks. Like ""An Optimist Declines"", which features two free guitar/drum duets sandwiching a menacing low-end drone, like the light at both ends of a tunnel, as Grubbs offers enigmatic lyrics describing ""smoke edged with glass, backlit."" With ""Holy Fool Music"", however, his pastoral reverie veers radically to rock, albeit rock infused with momentum-subverting tricks along with the occasional big riffs and drum rolls. Even then, the song ends back in the ether, the pensive transition to the instrumental ""Storm Sequence"", whose title may reference a day in the studio when (per the liner notes) the temperature ""hit a record 105 degrees before thunderstorms came, turned the sky green, and thrashed the cornfields.""</p>
<p>See what a little bit of direct language can do? Grubbs' compulsive poetic obfuscation makes for fine capital-A Art, but its inherent pretentiousness hurts ""Eyeglasses of Kentucky"", apparently an elliptical Ambrose Bierce paraphrasing tribute to Lexington photographer Ralph Eugene Meatyard that would have benefited from a more direct bent. ""Here's a photo of a house/ An embarrassing semblance of face,"" Grubbs sings, adding little to the mood of the track beyond enigmatic distraction and further abstraction.</p>
<p>In the press notes Grubbs calls the album, somewhat glibly, ""a step into the void,"" and with ""The Not-So-Distant"", the void finally arrives in full force. Or maybe full lack-of-force is more accurate, as for nearly 12 minutes the track hums, ebbs, and (sort of) flows, a menacing vampire-morning sunrise that unfolds like a slow explosion erasing everything from the horizon. It's scary because it's so simple and spare, a quietly cresting and falling apocalypse that soothes the crap out of you. Or maybe it's just some avant-garde term-paper bullshit dreamed up in the exact duration it took to record. The optimist, however, would note such a perspective doesn't alter the track's creepy effectiveness, even as, in one gradual sweep, it makes you instantly forget nearly everything that came before it, until it, too, disappears.</p></div>"|12299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12299-an-optimist-notes-the-dusk/|5.2|Joshua Klein

As Julien Temple's recent documentary, <em>Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten</em>, illustrated, the titular Clash frontman went to great lengths to distance himself from his well-established pre-punk/pub-band roots, and perhaps as a result, the Clash railed against classic-rock hero worship harder than most, by taking names (""no Elvis, Beatles, or the Rolling Stones in 1977!""), stealing sacred riffs (the Who's ""I Can't Explain"" bastardized into ""Clash City Rockers"") and redesigning pop history in their own image (the Elvis-swiped cover art of <em>London Calling</em>). So surely these detractors of ""phony Beatlemania"" must've had a good ol' laugh at the prospect of conquering one of the key sites of the real Beatlemania.<br/><br/>Of course, it would take a tour invite from the Who to get the Clash into Shea Stadium on Oct. 13, 1982, but in a way that just makes the story all the more rich: the punks meet the godfathers-- the former at the peak of their commercial ascendancy, the latter on the way to the first of many retirements. But while the two bands were born of different eras, both had followed similar trajectories, having each made their own escapes out of garageland to pursue more ambitious musical plans. And yet <em>Live at Shea Stadium</em> (a popular bootleg now receiving official release on its 26th anniversary) marks something more than just the passing of the torch between two generations of kindred spirits; it also documents the first time class-of-'77 punk-rockers graduated to the American stadium circuit, and the pyrrhic victory contained within. The Shea show was not the biggest the Clash ever played in America (that would be the US Festival in 1983), nor the most incendiary (see: the legendary 17-show string at New York's Bond Casino in 1981), but the set most vividly captures the Clash's most enduring qualities: the triumphs and tribulations of being populist punks. <br/>¬†<br/>Fittingly, the Clash's Shea Stadium coronation would come in a downpour of very English rain. But where the Who might use such a backdrop to dramatize a typically blustery version of ""Love, Reign O'er Me"", for the Clash, the soggy weather was an ideal way to make a ballpark feel more like a sweaty dive. Following a humorously crowd-baiting opening spiel from Clash cohort Kosmo Vinyl, Joe Strummer introduces ""London Calling"" by declaring ""welcome to the Casbah Club!"" It's the first of many quips that Strummer uses to downsize the stadium spectacle into more club-like dimensions (""shhh‚Ä¶ would you please stop talking at the back, it's too loud!""), and he's also careful not to turn his elevated podium into a pulpit; rather than use the spotlight to educate the American masses on the urban unrest that inspired ""Guns of Brixton"", Strummer simply offers, ""If you don't know what's goin' on, just ask the person standing next to you.""</p><p>Foreshadowing the BBC Radio Global a Go-Go broadcasts that would define his later career, Strummer sounds happiest playing cruise-leader to his band's genre tourism, talking the audience through a live mash-up of <em>Sandinista</em>'s rap-rock prototype ""The Magnificent Seven"" and Willie Williams' reggae standard ""Armagideon Time"" like he was holding a bus megaphone: ""This is a black New York rhythm we stole one night...so while we're here doing our little thing, I'm gonna take you to Jamaica...so hold on, fasten your seatbelts, extinguish all reefers!""<br/><br/>But while Strummer's stage banter frequently highlights the seeming absurdity of the Clash playing a venue the size of Shea, the set list more than justifies their promotion to it, adhering as it does to the time-honoured stadium-rock tradition of playing the hits and playing them often; even the band's current release at the time, <em>Combat Rock</em>, is represented only by its two popular singles (which means there's no ""Straight to Hell"" to lure in newly arrived ""Paper Planes"" chasers). Highlighting the staggering procession of classic singles the band had amassed in just five short years, the incredibly well-preserved (or greatly refurbished) <em>Live at Shea Stadium</em> recordings make the contradictory concept of stadium-punk seem like a natural state: if anything, the lock-and-load riffs of ""Tommy Gun"" and the shout-and-response reworking of Eddy Grant's ""Police on My Back"" sound like they were originally designed with the bleachers in mind. <br/><br/><em>Live at Shea Stadium</em>, however, also provides a glimpse into the existential quandaries that would afflict agit-punk progeny from Rage Against the Machine to Against Me! onward: that is, the inherent difficulty of reconciling your activist politics with your growing bank balance. As the lone Clash original featured from their 1977 debut, ""Career Opportunities"" seems like a particularly odd choice to play at Shea, if only because these sorts of gigs forever distanced the Clash from the dole-line doldrums detailed within (a notion the Clash themselves seemed to have already addressed with <em>Sandinista!</em>'s cheeky kiddie-choir cover version). You can also hear the band's simmering tensions play out in the rather hollow version of ""Rock the Casbah"", which suffers from both the physical and spiritual absence of Topper Headon, the drummer who came up with the song's rhythm and its indelible piano-rolled hook, but whose chronic drug problems got him ousted from the band on the eve of the <em>Combat Rock</em> tour (to be replaced by original Clash drummer Terry Chimes). As a result, the Clash's most effortlessly funky tune is rendered as a rather joyless, standardized guitar rocker-- one that betrays the flagging enthusiasm that would eventually send Mick Jones packing less than a year later, and force Strummer to deep-six the band for good following 1985's roundly derided <em>Cut the Crap</em>, the only band that matters silenced with barely a mutter.<br/><br/>In a cunning premonition of their own impending collapse, the Clash bid Shea Stadium adieu with their signature cover of the Bobby Fuller Four's ""I Fought the Law"", the ultimate fight song for those who got no more left in them. The Clash may have showed up at Shea to inherit the Who's torch and create a new model of the thinking person's rock star for the 1980s, but they ultimately flubbed the hand-off-- and <strong><a href=""/article/record_review/145879-u2-under-a-blood-red-sky"">a group of Irishmen</a></strong> were more than happy to swoop in from the sidelines and run away with it.</p></div>"|12322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12322-live-at-shea-stadium/|7.7|Stuart Berman

During those lengthy intervals she established herself as a perfectionist who took her own sweet time making records and tweaked every aspect until it met with her highly strict requirements, which of course she never explained to anyone else. She worked intuitively rather than scientifically-- the songs had to feel right. But those albums fully justified both the waits and her peculiar particularity: Williams' self-titled album expressed her inner desires and uncertainties so comfortably that country and blues felt like second skins, and <em>Car Wheels</em> is a tough and tender travelogue. Neither sounds overworked; she toiled for nearly a decade on each to sound completely off the cuff.</p><p>In the decade since <em>Car Wheels</em>, Lucinda has increased her output considerably, releasing three studio albums and a double live with only two or three years between them. If once she was difficult to work with, she has becoming increasingly difficult to listen to, penning uninspired songs that rest uneasily on lyrical clich√©s, unpalatable vocal scrawls, and a talking-blues delivery that obsessed her but confounded all others. Her gradual downfall sounded like a concerted retreat from roots-rock respectability (no crime there) and an unhealthy, unhappy self-sabotage, and 2007's <em>West</em> was the one thing that no one ever expected from Lucinda: an utterly irredeemable album, short on melodies and insights but long on self-absorption. It would have been a fascinating failure were it not so unfathomably dull.</p><p>Perhaps it's fitting that her new album, <em>Little Honey</em>, begins with ""Real Love"", an unironic, unsentimental statement of newfound happiness that sounds like 1992's <em>Sweet Old World</em>-- or at least <em>Essence</em>. It's not a Mary J. Blige cover: Instead of searching for a real love, she's found one, and it involves a guitar and an audience. Williams reasserts her talent for taking a vague sentiment and unraveling it into something real and immediate. Her vocals sound perfectly slurred, the guitars nicely abrasive, the lyrics suitably modest but incisive. It's enough to raise expectations that <em>Little Honey</em> will be a significant uptick in her output.</p>
<p>It is. And it isn't. While Williams generally sticks to her strengths and suppresses most of her more unsavory musical habits, she maintains her curious reliance on tacky AABB rhyme schemes and lyrical clich√©s like ""It's raining cats and dogs"" (on the otherwise excellent ""Circles and X's""). From anyone else, that line might not warrant scrutiny, but Williams-- the daughter of former poet laureate Miller Williams-- has shown a poet's eye for detail, phrasing, and juxtaposition, laying out her sentiments in a conversational style and downhome cadence, and her earlier work inspired highest standards in her listeners. Lines like that pepper the album, but every bad habit of hers appears in the embarrassing ""Honey Bee"", an anonymous rocker on which she literally shouts her lines: ""Oh my little honeybee/ I'm so glad you found me/ Buzz around you hive now/ You're in overdrive now."" John Belushi's ""King Bee"" sketch was more dignified.</p>
<p>After that side-one lull, <em>Little Honey</em> picks up considerably with a string of tracks that recall the old, exacting Williams. She sounds like she might even be having fun on the gospel-blues ""Well Well Well"" and ""Jailhouse Tears"", a duet with Elvis Costello that's a fitting sequel to ""There's a Story in Your Voice"", their previous pairing on his 2004 album <em>The Delivery Man</em>. ""If Wishes Were Horses"" creates an animal metaphor that actually something meaningful: ""If wishes were horses, I'd have a ranch,"" she sings on the lovely chorus. Her vocals are wounded yet measured, as heartbreaking as you know she can be, even on ""Heaven Blues"", which recalls the acoustic blues of her first two albums.</p>
<p>After such a build-up, it's all the more discouraging that <em>Little Honey</em> falters at the end. ""Plan to Marry"" poses a gorgeously mopey lament: ""Why do we marry? Why do we fall in love? Why do we keep believin'?"" She sounds like she's going to wash her hands of the whole romantic mess, but sadly, those questions don't remain rhetorical: She actually answers them, turning the song into a saccharine lover's anthem. It's a poor lead-in to ""Long Way to the Top"", an aimless AC/DC cover with showy gospel backing vocals and a jaded, defensive tone that leaves a bitter aftertaste. For Lucinda, it's a long way <em>from</em> the top, although it's nothing a good eight years wouldn't fix.</p></div>"|12271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12271-little-honey/|5.7|Stephen M.

Ours being a suburban republic, now and then we want both, and few musicians are better at this union of sensibility than Chad VanGaalen.¬†The one-time busker from Calgary has a knack for summoning a virginal rural past with his picking and strumming, a dreamy patch of woodland, though he can also work up a mean batch of richly abrasive experiments that bear little relation to the pastoral.
<div>Part of the charm of VanGaalen's past two records, 2005's¬†<em>Infiniheart</em>¬†and 2006's¬†<em>Skelliconnection</em>, arose in their sense of looseness and disorder, which came through in the lyrics, the sequencing, and the textures. Both releases drew from an archive of home recordings; consistency would be tough to fake. But on his latest release, he gathers a handful of songs recorded around the same time, in the same place (his basement), with the same equipment (""primarily on an old tape machine and a¬†<span class=""caps"">JVC</span>¬†ghetto blaster,"" according to the press notes). Small wonder that, with¬†<em>Soft Airplane</em>, VanGaalen finally attains a uniformity of sound and theme that can hold his gorgeously fractured songs together. Past the numberless instruments, styles, and guises, the solid form of Chad VanGaalen is now visible.</div>
<div>¬†</div>
<div>Neil Young meets Thurston Moore,¬†an irresistible comparison to draw, does touch the heart of VanGaalen's aesthetic. The emotionally cracked falsetto, the nerdy forays into science fiction, the death-instinct, the longing, and the very metropolitan impatience with harmony and quiet are all there. We see this as we slip into ""Molten Light"", a murder ballad in the vein of Young's ""Down by the River"", as VanGaalen sings, ""I dumped her body into the molten light/ It floated to the surface and it did not ignite."" He shot his baby, but unlike Neil's gunman, he watches her rise out of the water to sort him out. Equally morose, bearing another final-resting-place title, ""Willow Tree"" describes death as liberating as he reflects on hangings and Viking funerals over a twanging banjo.</div>
<div>¬†</div>
<div>Which isn't to say that the ratty glimpse of the future, the glitch and crunch of his on-the-cheap production, is no longer there. He keeps the rainbow of precious instruments-- jury-rigged drum machine, analog synths, accordions-- only now the choices feel smarter, more attuned to each song's spirit. Fuzzed around the edges, thick with mood, the Thurston Moore-like ""Bare Feet on Wet Griptape"" whizzes by on its careening guitars and melodic hooks. Clearly VanGaalen wants to keep his grip on a pop sensibility,¬†even if it's in¬†the warped form of a no wave jam. With its curious pairings of harmonica and synthesizer, ""Phantom Anthills"" and¬†""TMNT Mask"" drift further away from the countryside, all the way onto the dancefloor-- or rather VanGaalen's skewed vision of a dancefloor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>These gestures toward a wider audience aren't free of VanGaalen's chronic morbidity. Where we do it in our thoughts, or on our anonymous blogs, this man thinks about death with his instruments. Now he's just going easier on the ears. We see this on the charismatic ""Cries of the Dead"", which artfully fleshes out the fixation on death that has marked all of his work, with the help of pop flourishes and patterns. In a matter of minutes, listeners are shuttled from the sight of a man beating his dog, to a memory of gazing upon a lover's painting of mountains and feeling like he was there. The song distills the essence of <em>Soft Airplane</em>, an intimate, intelligent, and always transporting cycle of songs that sends VanGaalen closer to his own voice and, in the process, closer to us.</div></p></div>"|12319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12319-soft-airplane/|7.7|Roque Strew

It's a cute little movie--  decently scripted, well-acted mumblecore for teens. Though its portrayal of indie fandom seems  focus-grouped and reconstituted within an inch of its life, the film's earnest romance-- about young love, about New York City,  and about losing your shit over music in its various forms-- helps quell  the inevitable cynicism. This movie is, after all,  called <em>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist</em>.</p><p>The thing is, the film isn't actually about music. Sure, Nick labors  over heartwrenching mix CDs for his newly ex-girlfriend, which Norah  finds discarded and cherishes as her own. Indeed, much of the movie's  storyline is predicated on its characters finding a purportedly awesome  band with the unfortunate name of Where's Fluffy?, and there is the  occasional conversation about real live music and actual listening habits  and such. But, really, music as it exists in the film is a plot device  rather than a thing of actual concern for the characters; a quick find-and-replace  on the ol' script, and you could just as easily turn Nick and Norah  into voracious cinephiles trying to hunt down a rare screening or something.</p><p>That in mind, the film music  that actually makes its way to the soundtrack is, at best, secondary  to the goings-on.¬† Nearly every song is used much as it might be  in any other commercial film about anything; occasionally, a choice  cut-- like Richard Hawley's searching ""Baby, You're My Light""  in a tender scene-- evokes the moment at hand, and Bishop Allen do  appear on-screen to play a few bars of ""Middle Management""  at a show. Oh, and there's Devendra Banhart, for a half-second, talking  about orgasms. By and large, though, tunes are relegated to mere background  noise, something to fill in the silence of the surroundings.</p>
<p>Taken as a playlist, the <em>Nick and  Norah</em> soundtrack has only a few things to recommend it. It's totally  frontloaded, leading off with Chris Bell's classic ballad ""Speed  of Sound"" and leading into Devendra's bouncy ""Lover"", the aforementioned  Bishop Allen track, and Vampire Weekend's stellar new ""Cape Cod  Kwassa Kwassa"" quoting ""Ottoman"". Things dip significantly around  the Dead 60s almost comically hollow Franz Ferdinand ripoff, picking  up again briefly with Band of Horses' lovely, compact ""Our Swords""  and highlighted throughout by Hawley, a not-half-bad Shout Out Louds  tune, and Mark Mothersbaugh's spacily evocative theme song. Much of  it is decidedly unexceptional, favoring generally applicable sentiment  and wide-open chords rather than anything potentially challenging. It  turns out like something your friend might leave in your car that you  don't mind skipping around on occasionally but would never bring up  in conversation; and, though that method might very well turn a person  on to the Submarines or something-- its intended purpose, one presumes-- it's  not an especially good calling card for any of the up-and-comers here  the way <em>Garden State</em> hipped a lot of people to, alas, Frou Frou.</p>
<p>It's telling that nearly all  of the non-live music played in <em>Nick and Norah</em> comes from MP3 players  and burned CDs, rather than commercially-available physical products  like this very soundtrack; the movie seems to be urging folks towards  music discovery through conversation and keeping an open ear, but the  fact remains that this is a group of tracks in a set running order available  on such unplaylistable formats like that vinyl the kids keep on buying.  It all just seems so antithetical to the film it's supposedly attached  to; Nick might've burned this sucker once and popped it in his car,  but he would've also started almost immediately on the next installment,  and that's not something having a physically released soundtrack makes  any deference to.</p>
<p>And, hey, maybe round two's coming;  there was great music aplenty in the film, from the National and Modest  Mouse and Tapes 'n Tapes, that doesn't appear on this soundtrack,  and the reasons for the inclusion of, say, Paul Tiernan's sorta hokey  ""How to Say Goodbye"" and not ""Insistor"" are unclear.  One has to wonder what exactly the point of a soundtrack like this is  in 2008, where folks could just as easily download the songs-- even  the ones, gasp, that didn't make it to the disc-- for the jumpoffs  of their own infinite playlists. For this product to have relevance  commercially or otherwise, the songs on it have to matter, and with  the exception of a great Vampire Weekend tune and some frequently great  (just-so-happens-to-be-indie-)pop, it doesn't matter enough not to  just burn yourself.</p></div>"|12317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12317-nick-and-norahs-infinite-playlist-ost/|5.2|Paul Thompson

On ""I Wonder Who Is Like This One"", the opening track on Norlin's sophomore album as Hello Saferide, <em>More Modern Short Stories From...</em>, she compares herself to ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"": ""Annoying at times, but I make you want to dance."" On 2005 debut <em>Introducing</em>..., though, Norlin's storytelling, tunefulness, and sweet, sweet LOLs made her more like ""A Postcard to Nina"". The same person returns on Hello Saferide's latest, a little older, sometimes wiser, and, for better and for worse, more presentable to your parents.</p><p>Bright guitar-pop and neurotic narratives still abound, only this time Norlin's worries are more serious than stalking high-school crushes on AltaVista or having too many drinks on Saturday night. Poignant, wittily crafted first single ""Anna"" pivots off of a throwaway line from <em>Introducing...</em>'s ""I Can't Believe It's Not Love!"" to imagine an HIV-curing, Nobel Prize-winning daughter who might've never known heartbreak-- something which the narrator clearly has on her buddy list. At a time when buzzier bands can get by mostly on vibe and tasteful influences, you'll actually need to pay attention all the way through the piano and harmonica of aptly titled male-female duet ""Overall"" to appreciate why these parents are so worried about their son playing the same violent video games we all did. Bonnie and Clyde fantasy ""Middle Class"", too, will be more rewarding if you're not multi-tasking.</p><p>Much as the U.S. edition of <em>Introducing...</em> had odd recurring motifs like a fear of feet, dislike of sci-fi flicks, and contemplation of suicide by knife, thematic threads help <em>More Modern Short Stories From...</em> cohere into more than a collection of singles. Bob Dylan comes up a couple of times, first on cello- and Hammond-graced ""Lund"", where an unusually Joni Mitchell-esque Norlin sings about someone her narrator once knew-- - ""He came from the south of Sweden/ He spoke just like a Dane""-- who ""would have gotten my virginity."" That's right before Norlin's tendency toward blush-worthy frankness leads her to a description of first sex, on the uncharacteristically predictable ""X Telling Me Something About the Loss of Something Dear, at Age 16"". Likewise, Norlin's metaphorical return to the womb on ""Parenting Never Ends"" leads, musically and lyrically, to the might've-been birth of ""Anna"".</p>
<p>Norlin's Swedish-language debut last year as S√§kert! (which translates, roughly/idiomatically, to ""Yeah right, for sure"") had her using electric guitar more often than acoustic, a transition she completes on the new album. That shift, coupled with Andreas Mattsson's radio-ready production, means such weaker songs here as generic-sounding modern rocker ""Travelling With HS"" can't simply fall back on homemade charm. Norlin's onomatopoeic sound effects on delicate, string-draped meditation ""Arjeplog"" just barely redeem their potential cloyingness, and ""Sancho Panza"" sums up Hello Saferide's dorky-outsider persona almost too neatly. ""25 Days"" counts down until the narrator will know whether her budding romance has endured ""backpacker girls with newly braided hair and Manu Chao records""; when the guy texts to say he got the dates wrong, she repeats at least one time too many, ""You stupid fuck!"" As with Morrissey or Motown, Norlin's music is most likable when you have to look close to trace the tracks of her tears.</p></div>"|12296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12296-more-modern-short-stories-from/|6.8|Marc Hogan

A lot's been made about how it could possibly revitalize hardcore, although framing it within genre terms tends to lead to the wrong questions: Is it too melodic and instrumentally diverse to qualify as hardcore? Maybe. Is it heavy and chaotic enough to satisfy fans of the debut, even while it dramatically broadens their fanbase? Possibly. Can a band as destructive as Fucked Up really carry an entire scene on their sweaty, unshaven backs? Stranger things have happened.</p><p>It might seem counterintuitive to call <em>Chemistry </em>a grower: From the first listen, it's both pummeling and riveting. When frontman Pink Eyes (Damien Abraham) makes his grand entrance 1.5 minutes into the massive album opener ""Son the Father"", he channels G.G. Allin by way of Les Savy Fav's Tim Harrington, delivering fiercely intelligent lyrics in a singing voice presumably treated by years of guzzling Canadian Club and then eating the bottles.</p><p>That said, <em>The Chemistry of Common Life</em> is a guitarist's album: 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk) and producer Jon Drew balance classic rock force with shimmering overdubs, at times recalling the Smashing Pumpkins, while at others echoing the layered, chiming guitars and famed loud/quiet dynamics of <em>Bossanova</em>-era Pixies. First single ""No Epiphany"" has 18 overdubs alone. Fractured harmonies bring ""Crooked Head"" to its cruising altitude, while breakneck opener ""Son the Father"" is almost tactile in its texture, with power chords and rich overtones busting into an arm-swingng chorus that doubles as the record's thesis: ""It's hard enough being born in the first place/ Who would ever want to be born again?""</p>
<p>It's a hell of a pace to sustain, particularly after the bongo-laced battering ram ""Magic Word"", but Fucked Up get plenty of help: <em>Chemistry </em>is an ""it takes a nation of millions"" endeavor, born out of a sense of community and the determination to create something huge. According to the band, something along the lines of 70 tracks of instruments went into the making, as well as guest vocals from Vivian Girls and Sebastian Grainger (formerly from Death From Above 1979). It's not a situation where Fucked Up are seeking credit merely for beginning the album with a flute or other decidedly non-hardcore instruments. These touches often provide the most memorable moments: The gorgeous curtain-raise of female voices that open ""No Epiphany""; ""Twice Born"" and its shout-along chorus (""Hands up if you think you're the only one denied!""); the mystic Black Mountain-style duet on ""Royal Swan"".</p>
<p>Along with a sense of community, the album also offers a refreshing take on religion<em></em>. Fucked Up's spiritual bent is something richer than believers being targeted by secularists aiming to make them look stupid (there's your <em>Religulous </em>spoiler-- save the $10): <em>Chemistry </em>is questioning but rarely cynical, the album's midsection testing faith in the face of reason and science, and finding meaning in the actual search for answers (""Days of Last"", ""No Epiphany"").</p>
<p><em>Chemistry </em>doesn't sit still, and perhaps paradoxically, its most palatable track might be its most divisive-- judging from the ringing open-chords and insistent drum beat of ""Black Albino Bones"", you might get the idea that this is actually an indie rock album (oh yeah, it is on Matador), a forgotten Husker Du track, or god forbid, pop-punk. Were it given a more conventional vocalist, it could easily sidle into MTV with more ease than <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqsdSti02gQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this performance of ""Twice Born"".</a></strong> But while ""Black Albino Blues"" marks the album's most melodically uplifting track, it might be the most lyrically melancholy, furthering the message of the title track that the magic in our lives is still often a result of nature. ""It's the little things that get us through life,"" barks Pink Eyes before Dallas Green sweetens up with ""I need a little escape."" This still being Fucked Up, it's a song about sex and drugs, but if they happened to leave something out of that eternal triad, it's only because <em>The Chemistry of Common Life </em>kicks enough ass to demand inclusion on its own terms.</p></div>"|12320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12320-the-chemistry-of-common-life/|8.8|Ian Cohen

How can you take seriously any band that takes itself so seriously? Not that Secret Machines don't take themselves seriously. Indeed, glimmers of Roger Waters-- the most famously no-fun and pompous name in prog-- have always been in the group's songs. But fortunately, Secret Machines have also recognized that a rock band needs first and foremost to actually rock, and although they can represent Pink Floyd at their most po-faced, they are also fueled by the muscular thump of Led Zeppelin.<br/><br/>Zeppelin were, of course, powerful enough to get away with multi-part musical marathons and prodigious interplay while still avoiding the prog tag. Following that lead, Secret Machines have even got their own John Bonham-like anchor in drummer Josh Garza. Yet it's not Garza's presence that initially dominates this self-titled third album but the absence of Benjamin Curtis, who left Secret Machines last year, leaving Garza and brother Brandon Curtis behind. Surely his departure necessitated a slight rethinking of the group's musical strategy, and indeed the group's injected a good deal of <em>Scary Monsters</em>-era David Bowie's frayed art-glam, among other elements, to good effect. <br/><br/>Yet Secret Machines remain the same band responsible for <em>Now Here Is Nowhere</em> and <em>Ten Silver Drops</em>, which means the toughest tracks often still devolve into hypnotic grooves and motorik mutations, and the gentlest starts often lead to the most bombastic conclusions. Curtis has been replaced by Phil Karnats, whose guitar is often used as an almost-synth like effect layered on top of the group's menacing melodies and pulsing beats. It's an interesting balance, lending even relatively short tracks such as ""Atomic Heels"" (with its hints of ""Diamond Dogs"") and ""Underneath the Concrete"" the feel of epics. When the band does up the run time, as with the nearly eight-minute ""Have I Run Out"", the results justify the indulgence. And when Garza's double-time syncopation, Brandon Curtis' keys, and Karnats' guitar synthesize into a series of squelches and searing sounds, it makes for hypnotic space-rock. <br/><br/>But Secret Machines can do mellow, too, at least to a degree, as demonstrated by highlight ""Now You're Gone"", which begins more meditative and stripped down before the oppressive arrangements kick in. But here they're allowed to breath, almost floating above and around Garza's gallop until the song hits its inevitable concluding crescendos. ""The Walls Are Starting to Crack"" pulls off a similar trick while at the same time tipping its hat to the band's prog predecessors more than ever (and directly, too, not via some circuitous Radiohead route). You can hear Pink Floyd, but also King Crimson, even Van Der Graaf Generator, a nice set up for ""I Never Thought to Ask"", a pretty ballad that splits the difference between <em>Hunky Dory</em> and <em>The Final Cut</em>. <br/><br/>With ""The Fire Is Waiting"", the band finally gets to cut loose with a full-on 11-minute blow-out full of Godzilla-sized riffs and quiet interludes. The song's length, especially as it transitions to otherworldly hums and drones, provides the perfect opportunity to ruminate: sure, it's grandiose, but is it pompous? Do Secret Machines cross that line? Well, yeah, probably, they do. With its apocalyptic portent, <em>Secret Machines</em> demands to be taken seriously. But at least the music-- ambitious, scary, inspiring, rousing-- matches the sentiment. Secret Machines are serious about what they do, and until more bands find ways to balance pop, prog, and booming hard rock as well as the Machines do on ""Last Believer, Drop Dead"", that pomposity can be forgiven as just part of the whole package.</p></div>"|12318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12318-secret-machines/|7.2|Joshua Klein

I like to think of German-born Max Richter as standing somewhere in the middle of that bridge, a modern composer with a pop musician's sense of conceptual unity, emotional connection, and payoff. His albums to date have played like post-minimalist classical for those who follow indie rock and electronic music-- they could lead a Mogwai fan to Arvo P√§rt and Gavin Bryars, or a P√§rt fan to Rachel's, Stars of the Lid, and Philip Jeck. The point is that he makes art music with broad appeal, miles from the kind of process pieces that are easier to read about than listen to.</p><p>Richter's latest takes a step into a part of the pop world few modern composers have approached: the ringtone. Old-school classical music has been there for a while-- I have friends with piano sonatas, Mozart snippets, and bits of Bach on their phones-- but Richter is one of the first to build an entire recording around this most ubiquitous man-made ambient noise. These 24 brief tracks (totaling around a half-hour) are theoretically all meant to tell you that Mom is calling, but don't come expecting the bassline to ""Play That Funky Music"", the pep of ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"", or anything similarly snappy. These pieces are almost entirely in the same somber vein of Richter's other work. If you want a ringtone that could stop everyone else in the produce aisle in his or her tracks with its beauty, this is for you.</p><p>The main musical aim here appears to be tonal variety. Richter places a minute of burbling, crackling ambient noise next to a painfully gorgeous minute of violins slipping in and out of harmony, or an arpeggiating electric guitar smothered in voices. The piano pieces are soft, contemplative, and a bit chilly-- they make me think of wearing a sweater while reading a thoughtfully written book by the light of a single lamp in an otherwise dark home. Autumnal is a word I occasionally see used to describe the feel of Richter's work, and it certainly applies here. These pieces are falling leaves and brisk breezes embodied in bow strokes, keystrokes, and electronic textures.</p>
<p>Richter has discussed the possibility of performing shows using these pieces as ringtones on his audience's phones, controlling the music from the stage via text message-- I'd love to be at one of those shows to see how it feels as a droning violin or gently pulsing, organ-like tone spreads through the crowd. Setting the concept aside, this is a frequently haunting album, though it sacrifices a great deal of flow in the name of brevity and variety. Even if no one ever downloads it to a Nokia, the hair-raising violin of ""A Sudden Manhattan of the Mind"" makes its point just fine as part of the album. And that's the most important thing to remember about this album: the concept is strong, but the music is stronger.</p></div>"|12264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12264-24-postcards-in-full-colour/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Library Tapes) used ghostly pianos and sparse field recordings to create what sounded like Erik Satie compositions on dirty vinyl. Austere piano etudes either floated unadorned or¬†hid inside¬†a haze of scratchy ambiance. As if recognizing that he couldn't push this extreme minimalism much further (the next step would have been silence, and John Cage beat him to that by more than 50 years), Wenngren shifted into a heftier mode with last year's <em>Sketches</em> EP, where Danny Norbury added cello accents to the emboldened piano themes. Of course, ""hefty"" is relative: Like most of Wenngren's music, <em>Fragment</em> was stark, allowing for little interference between the listener and the limpid melodies.</p><p><em>A Summer Beneath the Trees</em> is still pretty ascetic, but by Wenngren's usual standards, it's practically Wagner. A lot of the credit for this newfound mass is due to Peter Broderick (who also played on the superlative <em>Fragment</em> EP), a young musician from Portland who worked as a session man with M. Ward, Zooey Deschanel, and others, before moving to Copenhagen to join Efterklang. Here, Broderick complements Wenngren's piano with a wide variety of accompaniment: violin, guitar, accordion, trumpet, celesta, viola, and banjo. <em>H√∂stluft </em>and <em>Fragment </em>were almost accidental music-- like walking by a house and catching a couple minutes of someone picking out a melody on a beat-up old upright inside. This is the fullest, most finished-sounding Library Tapes project since it was an official duo (with Per Jardsell), and may suit listeners who need more than a few endlessly revolving piano notes better than recent offerings. For fans of Max Richter, Tim Hecker, and Eluvium, <em>A Summer Beneath the Tress</em> is a can't-miss album.</p><p>It is also, by and large, an exceptionally melancholy album that never slips into outright pathos. Its bucolic title is belied by the music's wintry strains. ""The Sound of Emptiness"" parts one and two are slow, shrieking dirges; landscapes of nothing but wind and rocks. ""Pieces of Us Were Left on the Tracks..."" features one of Wenngren's typical, glittering piano themes, buttressed by mournful strings and contrapuntal guitar. These tracks and others like them convey a strong presentiment or memory of loss. More importantly, they serve as foils for the record's handful of triumphant moments, and render them more affecting by contrast. One exemplary track, ""Above the Flood"", begins with heartbroken piano, but lights up unexpectedly with jaunty, staccato strings, and ends with positively joyful flourishes. And on ""The Modest Triumph"", the strings take the lead for a sweeping theme that sounds like elation incarnate. As such, it's neither a stereotypically sad record nor a happy one-- it's just human, highlighting emotional extremes to imply the whole range between them.</p></div>"|12284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12284-a-summer-beneath-the-trees/|7.6|Brian Howe

Following a debut LP that clung tightly to boilerplate 60s-revisionist Cali-pop, the genial L.A. five-piece has stripped its sound down to something far more taut and rhythmically insistent for the group's sophomore effort, <em>Now or Heaven</em>. Consequently, at a base level the record is pretty much beyond reproach, marked by precise drumming, pulsing bass work, and an admirable use of musical space. Unfortunately, the Broken West doesn't do nearly enough with these sturdy building blocks compared to several other bands who mine similar sonic territory, and the result is merely competent pop-rock that routinely fails to rise above its foundations.</p><p>That's not the case with the record's opening track, ""Gwen, Now and Then"", a mostly unreplicated model of momentum, drive, and windswept cool. The lyrics are throwaways, but the way the hook hurtles forward speaks more to the joys of barreling down the highway with the windows down than any of this album's actual words speak to subjects like love and loss. Following that captivating opener, however, <em>Now or Heaven</em> largely loses sight of popcraft and gets overly preoccupied by atmosphere and suggestion instead. It'd be a forgivable trade-off if the Broken West could use its newfound love of minimalist grooves to conjure up sex and menace like, say, Spoon, but something's holding the group back. Mainly I think it might be Ross Flournoy's vocals, which can't help incongruently signifying boyish blitheness no matter how hard the band strives to moodily seethe beneath him. Sterling influences inform songs that fall just short of their marks-- Flournoy claims the Knife inspired ""House of Lies"", yet it comes off as beefy 80s AOR fodder (albeit pretty successfully), while the apparently Prince-beholden ""Got It Bad"" misses frustrated desire and settles for slight peevishness.</p><p>But hey, these guys have been touring with the National and the Walkmen, and clearly picked up some pointers, judging from the tight-as-hell high-hat-riding ""Terror For Two"" and elegantly spare ""Elm City"". Again, however, the scuff and seediness of those bands doesn't really suit the Broken West, not when the band is busy emulating the Shins on ""The Smartest Man Alive"". Given the far sunnier cast of the group's debut, it's fair to say <em>Now or Heaven</em> is a document of growing pains. Perhaps realizing that guileless jangle-pop is a 21st century creative dead end, the Broken West are encouragingly moving towards something darker and more mature, but for the time being remain stuck in an uncomfortable middle ground, aiming to unnerve but managing for now only to slightly unsettle.</p></div>"|12313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12313-now-or-heaven/|5.6|Joshua Love

Not usually beholden to the greater aesthetic or weight of an album, the single can stand on its own two pegs. It can be cranked out independently, ferociously, and perhaps most importantly in the case of a one Jay Reatard, quickly. Wham. Bam. Onto the next.<br/><br/>Such is the Taz-like clip with which Reatard has cranked out micro-epics since the release of his incredible solo debut, 2006's <em>Blood Visions</em>. That garage-punk opus spawned many of the cuts on<em> Singles 06-07</em>, the singles compilation released by the In the Red label just four months ago. Now he's back with <em>Matador Singles '08,</em> a collection of limited-edition singles recorded and released, like the title promises, this year for Matador. Harnessing his hyperactive work rate, Reatard's new home let him loose in what seems to be his natural habitat, encouraging him to headbutt a variety of sounds before recording a follow-up full-length.<br/><br/>While the In the Red singles share a certain wealth of diversity (synths!) with their Matador cousins, they didn't signal a major shift in sound. But here, Reatard goes the full Ramone, imbuing each recording with an expansive pop sensibility. And though this collection doesn't benefit from the sequencing a standard LP would, it does nicely chart the directions in which Reatard's self-described ""schizophrenic"" musical jones have hurried him. First A-Side ""See/Saw"" is a hail of Tommy gun guitar work and Reatard's rubbery bark, a noticeably snottier departure from the collapsed-lung screams listeners are accustomed to hearing from him.<br/><br/>""See/Saw"", alongside its excellent B-Side ""Screaming Hand"", is built on a healthy spine of acoustic guitar. A no-no in the rulebook of pure punk, it's an approach that defines many of Reatard's fresher foundations-- most dramatically, the gentle whispers (gasp!) of the kiwi-pop inflected single that wrapped up the series. That trio of songs-- ""No Time"", ""You Were Sleeping"", and the gorgeous ""I'm Watching You""-- hint at a possible sound for next year's full-length, but they don't effectively showcase what Reatard does best: erecting epics in spaces most would deem too tight for them. Listen to the way ""Always Wanting More"" breaks loose on the back of a caped riff and a chorus no basement or half pipe could contain. It's a moment bested on this record only by the final 30 seconds of hyper-caffeinated post punk dirge ""Trapped Here"".<br/><br/>Reatard's weaknesses present themselves when he leans too hard on the familiar-- ""D.O.A."" is a bit by-the-numbers-- or is out of his comfort zone, as he is on a nearly five-minute take on Deerhunter's ""Flourescent Grey"" built on drone and electric moans. Considerably longer than anything else in his jamography, Reatard is able to take a contemporary band's song and make it his own, no matter how radically the sonic paradigm might differ. It's admirable, but if he were to take a shot at writing something equally ambitious, with the energy you'd expect from him, the result could be dizzying. For now, he's making things look easy.</p></div>"|12316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12316-matador-singles-08/|8.4|David Bevan

Their hits have often been naked pleas for security and comfort in an era of baffling change, and they've sealed their everyman appeal by projecting these insecurities and worries onto the monster canvas stadium rock affords.<br/><br/><em>Perfect Symmetry</em> promises a shift in direction. Jacques Lu Cont's Stuart Price produced some of it; electronic tweaks and jagged drum patterns abound; they've radicalized their instrumental palette-- well, they've put a musical saw on one track. And perhaps most strikingly this is the first time they've put a record out in the same year as style leaders Coldplay. This album has been hyped in the same way <em>Viva La Vida</em> was-- as an experimental gear-change to escape a potential rut.</p><p>It starts well. First single ""Spiralling"" is enjoyably awkward and unexpectedly vigorous; all lurching rhythms, blaring keyboards, and desperate clipped whoops as Tom Chaplin sings about a life slipping into chaos. He then tries to ruin the song with a risible ""Once in a Lifetime"" spoken-word section, but he can't quite wreck his band's momentum. ""The Lovers Are Losing"" takes ""Spiralling"" and irons out its kinks, taking us into pure 80s chest-beating territory: An unashamed populist bigness of sound, underpinned by bright keyboards. Keane as a reborn Simple Minds, perhaps, or huger yet-- a melodic lift from U2's ""In God's Country"" serves notice that this band are aiming high indeed.<br/><br/>But that's part of the record's problem-- after a few songs <em>Perfect Symmetry</em>'s maximalism exhausts the listener. It can feel like Keane have been holed up in some pop laboratory, studying previous methods for making ""big music"" and ticking them off one by one. The title track, for instance, blends rolling piano, a trademark drivetime chorus, a middle eight out of the <em>Born to Run </em>playbook and a coda which finds common ground between U2 and ABBA. Oh, and it's a meditation on the July 2005 terror attacks in London. This is a lot to freight a song with, and in trying Keane sacrifice dynamics for bluster: none of its ideas manage to break loose and stand out.<br/><br/>Tom Chaplin's vocals run into similar trouble. He has a rich, crowd-stirring voice which he uses in exactly the same soaring way on almost every track: No vowel escapes unstretched, no meaning unstressed. It's the emotional equivalent of dynamic range compression-- the meters of feeling pushed unvaryingly into the red until you're left with a sense that passion is his comfort zone. Admittedly if you're given lines like ""The sky will be my shroud/ A cenotaph of cloud"" you can't afford to blink when you deliver them, but it means the more interesting images-- like ""I dream in e-mails""-- sound dumber than they actually are.<br/><br/>By the back end of <em>Perfect Symmetry</em>, it's business as usual for Keane: Epic piano belters to the fore, and the experimental approach promised by ""Spiralling"" has devolved into a rather odd James pastiche (""Pretend That You're Alone"")-- though by then you're grateful for any respite from the massiveness. To an extent, the world has called Keane's bluff-- even in the good times they traded in vague fretting, and now their lyrics are full of dislocation, futility, and panic. I can sympathize, but most of <em>Perfect Symmetry</em> sounds over-inflated. It's a band reaching for an arena-size sound and scale, but Keane's primary inspirations filled those huge spaces with charisma, not just glossy noise.</p></div>"|12314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12314-perfect-symmetry/|4.5|Tom Ewing

The tangible groundswell of sales surrounding the Knife, Love Is All, Jens Lekman, Lykke Li, Shout Out Louds, and Peter, Bjorn &amp; John seems to have caught major-label attention. (And, in part as a result, Robyn already has enjoyed a #1 in the UK.) Thus, the emergence of Anna Ternheim. She's a critical and commercial success back home, where she has a Swedish Grammy. Decca recently released a comp over here called <em>Halfway to Fivepoints</em>, culled mostly from her hit <em>Separation Road </em>and<em> </em>presumably released to warm audiences to a forthcoming full-length. A subsequent<span> </span>American trek supporting <em>svenskars</em> El Perro del Mar and Lykke Li followed. (Ternheim dubbed it the ""'Swedish Music Takes Over the World' tour."") For her part, she seems to lack either the poise of El Perro or the bubblegum appeal of Li, but <em>Fivepoints</em> hints at an effervescent personality who, at her best, hints at something darker and more complex than orchestral folk rock.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ternheim achieved her folksy hybrid on tour as a one-woman act, her iPod often acting as a backing band. On record, she's far more prepared and polished, backed by a full band and strings. At times her peculiar arrangements recall the beguiling progressive style of St.  Vincent's Annie Clark, but she's often subdued, whether backed by verdant orchestration (""Such a Lonely Soul"") or her own acoustic guitar (as on the somber Fleetwood Mac cover of ""Little Lies""). Her compositions all sound rooted in the same humble beginnings, hinting at a history as a coffee-house songstress excitedly discovering the pleasures of the audio field. Savvy listeners may have previously experienced, say, the Guillemots-by-way-of-Coldplay orchestral chorus of the opener ""Girl Laying Down"", but the tinker-toy way it was affixed to the piano stabs of the preceding verse seems more affectionate than affected.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">But whether playing at eclectic or electric, she's not immune from leaving an impression that she's laying a bit fallow, that she's waiting for something to <em>happen</em>. The bluesy guitar fills of ""Bridges"" seem directly lifted out of some bar-band's set-list. And the Fyfe Dangerfield (Guillemots) duet ""Lovers Dream"" drags aimlessly, Fyfe's pipes bridled save some indiscriminate yelps that sound like they were picked up off the <em>Through the Windowpane</em> cutting room floor. Her missteps point at a troubling lack of discretion (or, perhaps, artistic freedom) to reject a questionable eighth choice after making seven previous good choices.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Fivepoints</em> hints at the conflict of duality, a surprising game to play for a girl armed only with a guitar and an iPod. Love songs intertwine with romantic diffidence, folk rock clashes with Van Dyke Parks. Ternheim is capable of conceiving of her art as able to convey depth and innovation while still inadvertently slipping into bush-league tropes. Ahead of the pending release of her next full-length, it's tempting to speculate on how Americans will receive her. See, fans of the Sweden scene seem to be attracted by the perception that Peter, Bjorn, John, Lykke, and others listened to the same Fab Four, the same Dylan, the same Madonna, and the same Velvet Underground that we did, but like French y√©-y√© girls before them, they envisioned it possessing an exuberance that American pop has lost. It seems fairly obvious that Anna Ternheim has the exuberance, but it looks like she's still working on her vision.</p></div>"|12289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12289-halfway-to-fivepoints/|6.4|Mike Orme

Since founder and songwriting engine-- as well as former Lync frontman and longtime Isaac Brock bff-- Sam Jayne started the project as a platform for hissy four track meanderings in the mid-1990s, LAL have taken an increasingly populist bent to squeezing out their Stones-y indie rock. 2001's <i>From Sea to Shining Sea</i> and 2005's <i>Laughter's Fifth</i> arrived quietly and to less commercial ovation than you would think given the way they seemed to brush aside bands of their ilk. There were skyscraper hooks, whimsical lyrics, and, perhaps most importantly, there was nary a trace of pretense. At high volumes or low, Sam Jayne just seemed like he could give a fuck.</p>
<p>It's a charm, of course, that has benefitted Jayne's fly-unzipped songwriting greatly in the past. But <i> Holy</i>, his major label debut and first for Brock's Glacial Pace imprint (Brock also appears here, providing guitar licks in ""Paul Revere"" and ""All Parts Of Me""), is more a collection of scattered mood pieces than the big league unveiling it could have been. Produced by Joe Blaney, whose CV includes work with the Clash, the Ramones, and Tom Waits, <i>Holy </i> does enjoy an expected sheen that previous work didn't. Still, the end result feels flat and a little phoned-in, this despite Jayne's gradual and often fruitful progression towards breezy, back porch fare.</p>
<p>Undeniably top-heavy, <i>Holy </i>is an album whose more winning strummers and stormers are conveniently located in its first half. Title track and opener ""Holy"" is a slow-roasted acoustic number, with Jayne setting the tone via falsetto: ""Holy is never out of reach, I heard that demons don't hit the beach."" While muted, it still shares the oddly hypnotic effects of its predecessor on the 2005 LP <i>Laughter's Fifth</i>'s. There, opening track ""In Amber"" was a tone poem that tapped Keith Richards vein with great success. ""Holy"" does well by forming a Stones-saluting diptych with the subsequent ""Baby Shambles"", bouncing its guitar strokes into a latticework of carnival ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da's as the Dionysian thrust of its counterpart goes down just as smoothly.</p>
<p>Early highlights aside (particularly the bone-rattling ""Paul Revere""), much of the album could be written off as cruise-controlled and that feel definitely resonates. Jayne is wise to feature guitar tones that soften and grow more sumptuous with each listen, if only because it accents nicely the languid, almost lazy feel of the record as whole. Nothing feels forced. Even the glassy-and ill-advised tropical pop of ""All Parts Of Me"", which sounds more like a recent Modest Mouse outtake, brandishes an unusual sense of contentment. Few of the melodies feel inspired, but within the dusty halfway point, ""Konny And Jim"" resides the sound of a songwriter totally cool with that. He'll turn it up and on when he feels like it.</p></div>"|12287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12287-holy/|6.4|David Bevan

I'm not sure if it's just my mind playing tricks on me, but the Clips, a keyboard-dominated quintet who hail from Vancouver, really sound like the image I have of their hometown. What I picture is a city hemmed to the sea by tree-covered mountains, linked to a pristine island by an impressive bridge-- sort an intersection of sleek modernity and old-school nature. And I get that in this band's music, where the buzz and glide of electronic keyboards and reverb-drenched piano stacks up against raw, unrefined drums, crunchy bass, and long strands of guitar.</p><p>Even if that only makes sense in my own head, the band's basic power-trio-plus-two-keyboardists set-up is easy enough to understand. Their range is mostly rhythmic-- they go from fast songs with choppy drums to slow songs with choppy drums and back again-- but it's an interesting enough sound to fill an album, even if a few of the nine songs are overlong. It's hard to imagine from the start that they haven't been listening to a fair amount of Radiohead. ""Wire"" definitely feels like a post-<em>Kid A</em> song, with a calm electric piano playing an unresolved chord sequence that's even more unsettled by the frenetic drumming of Jeremy Gruman. Edo Van Breeman's vocals adhere to the voice-as-instrument school of singing, and the song is a solid, if lengthy, introduction to the band.</p><p>I imagine listeners to this band will be divided as to whether they're at their best working contrasting textures over a slow beat or in their more immediately accessible dance-rock mode. Both have their moments. Van Breeman's best vocal undoubtedly comes on the slow but persistent ""Eyesuck"", where he trades hooks with the guitar and ventures near a falsetto. The song veers off on two consecutive instrumental tangents, one geared for dancing, the second for coming down. The album flips conventional sequencing wisdom and ends with two of its danciest tracks, the buzzed-out instrumental ""2nd Hand Deal"", which launches itself from a sharp keyboard/bass riff into splatter disco passages where most of the instruments run into the red, and ""Kassel"", a strong song that nicely pays off the buildup in its verses with a rocketing keyboard riff.</p>
<p>""Kassel"" is the song that best crystallizes the band's talent, matching a strongly written, well-sung vocal verse against exciting and unpredictable instrumental passages. The band bogs down a bit in the middle of the album, with a string of four songs that are each only half successful. For instance, the march experiment ""Missing the Plan"" has interesting rhythmic ideas and a nice guitar solo, but the melody is basically flat and the song doesn't go anywhere even as it intentionally moves through differently arranged sections. Imperfect though it may be, <em>Matterhorn</em>'s handful of take-away songs make for a promising and enjoyable debut.</p></div>"|12276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12276-matterhorn/|6.8|Joe Tangari

The two share collaborators, hail from sleepy corners of their respective countries, and make music a Last.fm or Pandora bot would more than likely peg as ""similar."" Viewed a certain way, however, the two couldn't be more far afield. Elverum, as a songwriter, has long occupied himself with The Big Questions, his catalog full of probing meditations on birth and death, the elements, and the unknown. Doiron, conversely, has consistently stuck to the simple and domestic, quietly reveling in the tangible and everyday. Songs such as ""Snowfalls in November"" are patiently observed odes to satisfaction and serenity in the absolute. In short, Doiron is the contented period to Elverum's searching question mark.<br/><br/>The mini-album <i>Lost Wisdom</i> represents an intersection of those two distinct sensibilities and their resulting voices: Elverum, his tone often hesitant and sorrowful; Doiron, her singing reassuringly direct and familiar. For Doiron, this is a chance to wrap her warm, homespun vocals around Elverum's words of uncertainty, bringing earthly color to songs which, under the Mount Eerie banner alone, might emerge cold and gray. From her entrance on opening track ""Lost Wisdom"", a stately rumination rife with natural imagery which sets the tone for the album, through her solitary vocal on the <i>Songs</i>-era Leonard Cohen-evoking ""If We Knew..."", and on to the closing duet ""Grave Robbers"", Doiron is a reassuring presence in song-world often threatening to capitulate to doubt.<br/><br/>Indeed, it's this presence of a second voice that distinguishes <i>Lost Wisdom</i> amid the abundance of post-Microphones Phil Elverum material. To hear Elverum sing of his existential quandaries in isolation is frequently compelling, but with these songs often cast as duets, we're presented with the notion that Phil's struggles are universal. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than on ""Voice in Headphones"", the closest thing to a standout track on <i>Lost Wisdom</i>, with its harmonized refrain-- borrowed from Bj√∂rk's ""Undo""-- of ""It's not meant to be a strife/ It's not meant to be a struggle uphill."" It's the sort of lyric Elverum would have the whole crowd singing along to at a show, and here-- surrounded as it is by plenty of brooding restraint-- it sounds resoundingly triumphant, a more terrestrial counterpart to the otherworldly song it quotes and a kind of modern day spiritual for those oppressed within.<br/><br/>Elverum, too, benefits from the <i>de facto</i> constraints of this collaboration. The album was recorded during a brief touring respite, forcing him to forgo the intricate (if still lo-fi) ornamentation that typically adorns his output. It is instead, as he <b><a href=""../../../../../article/news/142105-mount-eerie-talks-julie-doiron-collab-tons-of-releases"" target=""_blank"">told Pitchfork</a></b>, a ""documentary of a session."" Even Fred Squire's electric guitar is notably unobtrusive as it complements the two voices and the steady rumble of Phil's acoustic. The result is a collection of songs so taut and concisely resonant as to be psalms. But psalms to be sung, perhaps, in secret: ""Grave Robbers"", the closing track, ends with someone abruptly shutting off the tape.

While he has a couple of albums to his credit-- 1997's eponymous solo turn and his lauded collaborations with Darshan Jesrani as Metro Area-- if his name has flittered by your eyes in the last half-decade or so it's likely due to his label, Environ, and its increasingly high profile or for his now-seminal mix, <em>Unclassics</em>, re-unearthed last year as a common ""next step"" for newly minted Italo-disco fans. So Geist's second solo artist album comes slapped not just with a cheeky title-- <em>Double Night Time</em>-- and high-profile guest vocals from the Junior Boys' Jeremy Greenspan but with toe-tapping ""it's about damn time""-anxiety. <br/><br/>Geist's 2006 remix of the Junior Boys' ""The Equalizer"" was the first clue, but Greenspan and Geist prove a natural fit. Whereas Geist's previous work had spun through excitable rave-pop (<em>The Driving Memoirs</em>) and electro-lounge cool (<em>Metro Area</em>), an older Geist mines the same lightly frosted pop sounds of Greenspan's Boys. Indeed, it's a patient, subdued album for the time in your life when Saturday questions like ""Where are all my friends tonight?"" have uneasy, obvious answers (""Married, the suburbs""). <br/><br/>That type of experience begets compositions that are skillful, but subtly so; Geist makes his sequencers and drum machines hum so efficiently that no one-- man nor machine-- breaks a sweat. It's a cloistered record-- with a uniform textuality-- that threatens to sound sterile as a result. The tempos remain even as well: Greenspan's voice isn't suited for rave-ups, but <em>Double Night Time</em> features few ballads, leaving almost every track in a milky midtempo soup. Geist's programming expertise has always leaned towards the expertly prepared rather than the sonically adventurous, and <em>Double Night Time</em> rarely surprises: It sounds like a control variable for future electronic pop experiments.<br/><br/><em>Double Night Time</em>'s real draw is Greenspan, who is at least not obviously saving bullets for the next Junior Boys album. It's a little strange to hear the relative newcomer tip-toe his way through ""Detroit"", Geist's tribute to motorik blends of Carl Craig and Derrick May, but by the time ""The Shore"" hits, the duo have found even terrain. Singing mostly Geist's lyrics, Greenspan matches Geist's veteran presence, detailing not the combustible dalliances of teenagers but the well-spaced hardships of adults. Relationships have pasts, and possibly futures; reflection is spread over years, not weeks. ""Ruthless City"" is their greatest triumph, Geist offering a minimal, mousy squeak and Greenspan seeking answers-- ""My best friend/ He once was yours/ He gave you all his love and money""-- going on breathlessly enough that Geist is forced to build the track into something of a climax. The track muddies the distinction between ""ruthless"" and ""truthless"" as the sequencers muscle and whir. The refreshingly busy chorus of ""The Shore"" speaks of ""panicked, backward glances,"" a fine encapsulation of urban adulthood. <br/><br/><em>Double Night Time</em> lags, though: the mostly instrumental tracks, ""Lullaby"" and ""Nocebo"" chief among them, are soggy and trying. Despite the album's most evocative title and Greenspan's only co-writing credit, ""City of Smoke and Flame"" finds too much comfort amid muted bass thumps. ""Palace Life"" is the only track that might crowd a dance floor, but there's no hook save a wordless choir as the track pounds to a close. Geist's contributions to electronica have always seemed fringe-- label head, remix specialist, in-demand crate digger-- and it's once again nice for him to have something to put his own name on. But after years of waiting, <em>Double Night Time</em> confirms that Geist is most valuable behind the curtain.</p></div>"|12227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12227-double-night-time/|6.0|Andrew Gaerig

So said guitarist/vocalist Mick Barr in Pitchfork's<strong> <a href=""/article/feature/142775-column-show-no-mercy"" target=""_blank"">interview</a></strong> with Krallice, his black metal band with Colin Marston and Lev Weinstein. He was referring to black metal's typical obsession with nature, given its origins in Scandinavia's rugged landscape. But Krallice is a nature band. It's just that New York's ""nature"" is concrete, glass, numbers, and dollars. Barr's and Marston's main gigs are Orthrelm and Behold...The Arctopus, respectively, two bands that showcase mind-boggling technicality. Their ""calculator metal"" aspect colors Krallice, which is precise, neurotic, yet powerful-- just like mathematician Maximillian Cohen, protagonist of <em>Pi</em>, Darren Aronofsky's Kabbalah/math thriller set in New York. ""For fuck's sake, how does a Jew end up listening to Burzum?"" Weinstein rhetorically asked. Easy: Cohen would have jammed <em>hard</em> on Krallice.</p><p>From their first note, it's obvious how unlike most other black metal they are. Barr's agonized yell isn't the usual witchy screech. The guitar tone nods to black metal's trebly buzz, but it also has rich midrange. Instead of paper-thin walls of cymbals, these drums have heft, blessed by a naturalistic analog recording. No Satanism, Odinism, or nationalism here-- a few mysterious phrases replace printed lyrics: ""Solar winds breed laceration""; ""The lesser gods have taken their withered placement back from man."" Most saliently, the guitar work isn't the typical minor chord that's moved up and down. These are complex, abstract lines, often spinning away from each other in counterpoint. In ""Cnestorial"", guitars cross at skewed angles, cutting the tonality loose in an indeterminate key. Eventually, dreamy sheets of Rothko-esque chords envelop the tune. ""Timehusk"" flutters with free jazz skronk, then resolves into straight-ahead thrash. ""Forgiveness in Rot"" weaves lines picked at light speed with curtain-like chords that billow open and shut. It's ambient music at 200 bpm.</p><p>The tremolo picking and blastbeats are unmistakably black metal, but this record otherwise relocates the Norwegian art form to Mars. Two American precedents do exist for Krallice: Weakling and Wolves in the Throne Room. Weakling were more emotional, and Wolves in the Throne Room are more lush, but both have stretched what essentially began as Satanic punk rock into 10-minute textural meditations. Krallice have now added math to the equation. The results are hard to grasp, but strangely addictive. <em>Krallice</em> would have made a marvelous soundtrack to <em>Pi</em>.</p></div>"|12250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12250-krallice/|7.8|Cosmo Lee

The duo Prints are a perfect fit, and not just because multi-instrumentalist Kenseth Thibideau is a veteran of four other TRL acts. Their self-titled debut full-length boasted subdued production, like-whatever lyrics, and a general sense that the project was a leisurely outlet for two talented guys who didn't need anything from it. Listeners in a mode of endless intake might welcome such a breezy ethic, but those laboring to achieve more spartan hard drives probably took a pass, waiting until Prints squirt out something that plays like it just had to be born.</p><p>This new EP builds ever-so-slightly on one angle of the debut, which fused boogieless aspects of dance music with polite hints of psych. Much of it seemed to crave sounding all-over-the-place, but settled for the mild outskirts of starchy <span>Tropic√°lia</span>. The album closer ""End"", though, added to the influence-porridge elements that suggested M83 trying to outswath a Trans Am coming after them with a cutting board. <em>Just Thoughts</em> mostly continues to mine this stilted, soft-hitting electronic vein. Less lingering is the suspicion that the tracks are showcases for musical chops whose authors didn't know or care whether they were making actual songs or, you know, ""pieces.""</p><p>The title kinda implicates the intentionally tossed-off lyrics, even though the phrase ""just thoughts"" actually appears during a passage worried about the brain's relentless presence. Stoner advice is the default here, with over twenty fizzy imperatives (""taste the color,"" etc.) coming in the first three tunes' twelve-minute span, climaxing in an answering machine message about tree sentience from Elizabeth Teebee'eh and the redeundant truism ""what we make is made."" Mind-clearing to the point of drool-farming.</p>
<p>Enter DFA's Tim Goldsworthy and !!!'s Tyler Pope, co-hosting a combined remix of two already-linked tracks from the long-player. Despite retaining the original Ween-caliber words (""There's a pretty tick/ Sucking your blood and shit"") it's ingratiatingly layered/sequenced, and even dismisses itself elegantly, full of life but never violating Prints' apparent policy of only allowing would-be bangers to percolate. Which is why their new music can come off elsewhere like stately Of Montreal reworks by Steely Dan, elevator MGMT, or worse, like the inevitable (after the re-cooling of Vangelis and Balearic textures) indie peekaboo into the soulpatched chillout lounge.</p></div>"|12245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12245-just-thoughts/|6.0|William Bowers

Inextricably shackled to the 2006 chain gang of heart-on-sleeve blog bands, the San Franciscan quartet throws on a pair of Groucho Marx glasses and makes a run for it, and who can blame them? They've seen their RIYL buds either shunned or put to sleep by indie audiences existing outside of comment sections and blog aggregators, and the only thing seemingly protecting these guys from a similar fate is their inferior exposure. Their escape plan? Trade in those jingle-jangle guitars for some rugged acoustics, essentially a last-ditch shtick-switch hoping to feed off of Feist, Sufjan Stevens, and a hankerin' for Americana that only an election year can bring.</p><p>Released digitally by Fader a month before it hit stores, <em>From the Mountain to the Sea</em> is so slick and inoffensive you'd think Lou Pearlman was managing these guys. 2006 debut <em>No Midnight </em>didn't exactly push the envelope musically, but its athletic 1990s rock sounds down right terrifying when compared to <em>Sea</em>'s coffeehouse whimper. Frontman Peter Arcuni finally sounds as cute and cuddly as his press photos, and the band does its best not to overpower his whisper. They don't even deign to slap any indie signifiers on their Muzak this time, not a Springsteen chorus nor a droning Pixies riff.</p><p>Lost in this monstrous buzz kill are a few decent Ted Leo rips, led by the spunky ""New Country"" and ""Greenland Sound"". Even on these tracks, though, the occasional tacky hook or flourish recalls Toad the Wet Sprocket, the Goo Goo Dolls, and other 90s ""alt"" bands with names (and songs) too painful to remember. On the other hand, these areas on <em>Sea </em>prove far more interesting than Arcuni's conflict-free tales of happily requited love and obstacles overcome. Single ""Born to Be Your Man"" and folksy opener ""My Love For You"" are sure to kill teenage girls with their romantic testifying, and uplifters like ""I Might Have Guessed"" suggest that Arcuni, when armed with his trusty acoustic/mandolin backing, can solve anything from the Wall Street crisis to a stubbed toe.</p>
<p>Unlike their last effort, there's not even a fully fleshed-out song here to suggest Birdmonster is destined for more than teen drama soundtracks, which may be fine since they don't sound interested in indie rock anymore anyway. That's not intended as a put down, either. Birdmonster never pretended to shy from mass appeal in the first place, and looking back, it's likely their grassroots 2.0 origins erroneously linked them with concurrent blog bands. Either way, their days of opening for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah appear long over.</p></div>"|12288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12288-from-the-mountain-to-the-sea/|3.2|Adam Moerder

For a band that once valorized rock'n'roll stardom as a vehicle through which to escape routine day jobs, Oasis have gone about their own rock'n'roll stardom as if it were a routine day job, their last decade of recorded output amounting to a model of passionless, assembly-line predictability. And yet, the Mancunian rockers have mostly held onto their status as the People's Band despite being 14 years and several million pounds removed from their scrappy, working-class roots-- mainly because (as their concert set-lists and greatest-hits CD tracklists prove), much like their legions of fans, Oasis only want to hear songs from their first two albums, too. <br/><br/>No one knows exactly what compelled 47-year-old Daniel Sullivan to bodycheck Noel into his stage monitors (busting the guitarist's ribs and forcing several show cancellations in the process); one can only hope he wasn't so much a psychopath looking to off a celebrity as a concerned fan hoping to shake some life into his favorite band and literally push them back to the underdog position that inspired their most enduring anthems. But we'll have to wait another album to see if the incident instills in Noel a newfound hunger and fire; for now we're stuck with <em>Dig Out Your Soul</em>, which like every Oasis album from 1997's <em>Be Here Now</em> onward, makes cursory gestures toward making the band's mod-rock more modernist, before reverting back to the same ol', same ol'. <br/><br/>The precipitous quality decline in Oasis' output since <em>Be Here Now</em>-- whose increasingly uninspired successors make it seem not so bad in retrospect-- can be measured two ways: the ballads got more overbearing (""Little by Little"", ""Where Did It All Go Wrong?""), and the rockers more sluggish (""Go Let It Out"", ""The Hindu Times""). At the very least, <em>Dig Out Your Soul</em> makes inroads to redressing both issues: the lilting sea shanty ""Falling Down"" is Noel's most graceful balladic turn since B-side ""The Masterplan"", while lead single ""The Shock of the Lightning"" is exactly the sort of tune Oasis needs more of to stave off impending geezerdom, a hard-driving strobe-lit rocker-- complete with a rejuvenating vocal turn from Liam and a suitably Keith Moon-like drum solo from moonlighting Who drummer Zak Starkey. It could be their most robust song since ""Morning Glory""; only a clunky middle eight lyric-- ""Love is a time machine/ Up on the silver screen""-- keeps it from entering the highest echelons of their canon.<br/><br/>The song's brisk velocity makes you wonder why Noel Gallagher doesn't write in this mode more often, as it still seems to come easy to him; as usual, he runs into trouble when he tries to affix weighty themes to flimsy songs. Two songs in a row talk about ""the rapture,"" but don't look here for any insights about the political dimensions of contemporary evangelicalism: While ""The Turning"" at least tries to back up its vague love-as-religious-experience imagery with some suitably stormy acid-rocked intensity (guided by Starkey's loose rhythm, a backing choir, and a repeated single-note piano stab), the Noel-sung ""Waiting for the Rapture"" is just a limpid cock-rock stomp speckled with the usual Beatleisms (""revolution in her head"") and Lennon lifts (specifically, the guitar riff to ""Cold Turkey""). <br/><br/>Sadly, this sort of lead-footed blooze seems to be Noel's default setting now, from the opening ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" crunch of ""Bag It Up"" to the awful honky-tonk exercise ""(Get Off Your) High Horse Lady"". Bassist Andy Bell likewise contributes the standard-issue ""Nature of Reality"", a pub-rock slosh that never delivers on the promise suggested by its ""Helter Skelter"" intro. Guitarist Gem Archer fares better with his songwriting ration, ""To Be Where There's Life"", which at least hitches its Beatles reference of choice (the wiggy sitar drones of ""Tomorrow Never Knows"") onto a more exploratory psych-funk rhythm, coming up with the sort of hypno-pop groover the Verve forgot to write for their recent album. <br/><br/>But while you'd think a band seven albums into its career would outgrow its formative influences (or at least try to), the Gallaghers' Fab Four embrace feels more suffocating than ever, with Liam's ""I'm Outta Time"" pushing Oasis to new depths of Lennon grave-robbing: just when you're about to forgive the schmaltzy ""Free as a Bird""-style arrangement and the cribbed piano chords from ""Jealous Guy"", they drop an actual Lennon interview sample in the fade-out (because naming his kid after the guy clearly wasn't tribute enough). While slavish Beatles idolatry has been Oasis' stock and trade since day one, the band's definitive early material at least roughed up the Fabs' pop classicism with pronounced punk, glam, shoegazer, and Madchester influences. However, over the past 10 years Oasis have gradually curbed those corrupting devices without replacing them with any new aesthetic inspiration. So all we're left with at the end of <em>Dig Out Your Soul</em> is a promise from Liam to ""solider on""-- not because the band sounds eager to take on the next generation of Britpop revivalists, but because at this point that's all Oasis really know how to do.</p></div>"|12311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12311-dig-out-your-soul/|4.9|Stuart Berman

Their debut deftly uses tape hiss as both a stylistic aid and compositional element, resulting in stocky blasts of melody. But where peers Deerhunter veer into amorphous song-globs and Times New Viking threaten to come unglued at any moment, <em>Women</em> has the cool, hard weight of something created under duress. You're reminded of how This Heat recorded their songs in a meat factory; <em>Women</em>‚Äôs cover-- a creepily synchronized group tai chi exercise-- recalls the sleeves for Reagan-era punk, released at a time when everything seemed vaguely politicized.</p><p><em>Women</em> was recorded by Sub Pop artist Chad VanGaalen in his basement, at least partially on boom boxes. The jangly whoosh of opener ""Cameras"" seems like a direct product of those bohemian environs: Quivering voices are propped up by picks scraping against strings, even when an exacted synth squiggle-- the first of several compositional left-turns-- betrays the rugged surroundings. ""Cameras"" lasts a mere 60 seconds and segues seamlessly into the steel-wool industrial sounds of ""Lawncare"", and from there, <em>Women</em> is deceptively easy and oddly energizing. Standout ""Black Rice""'s guitars rapidly approach and fall off little cliffs. ""Group Transport Hall"" is paisley-wallpapered psych, its hasty acoustic march a textural curveball. It's on tracks like these that singer Patrick Flegel's voice-- a sour monotone throughout much of the album-- gains unexpected contour, admirably navigating ""Black Rice""'s sighing chorus.</p><p>Elsewhere, <em>Women</em> draws from a deceptive range of styles: ""Upstairs"" sounds like a mathematical composite of the breezier half of <em>Chairs Missing</em>. Instrumental ""Sag Harbor Bridge"" is almost John Fahey-esque in the way that its distorted, weaving fretboard runs conjure its namesake. On ""Woodbine"", another instrumental, a long drone sits impatiently as tittering electronics accumulate at its edges.</p>
<p>By <em>Women</em>'s end, the band's guitars have rusted: ""January 8th"" is fevered paranoia, its guitars angrily panning between speakers. ""Flashlights"" slows the pace momentarily before ramping up to a Sonic Youth-style jamboree. It's a brash, youthful ending for a band that spent most of the album avoiding such bludgeoning. Also strange is ""Shaking Hand"", jittery, Dischord-style precision-rock; at just under five minutes, it's the longest track on the album. Women do spend a tad too much time flexing their way through their instrumentals-- a shame since, when they bother with songcraft, they rarely miss: concise, nuanced statements with idiosyncratic arrangements. Awkward, youthful moments exist, but Women tire of them almost before you do. What's left are the best of post-punk ingredients: curiosity, noise, and sly artifice.</p></div>"|12285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12285-women/|7.9|Andrew Gaerig

But just as there were droves of indie musicians in the early 1990s making bedroom pop on four-track recorders, there now seems to be a comparable amount of hooded heads grinding out CD-Rs of all kinds of sub-metal. Just check out some Aquarius Records mail-order updates from the past few years, and you'll see an array of names comprising a global army of basement metal-makers.</p><p>Most of these subterranean volume-pushers are pretty good-- at least most of the ones Aquarius champions are. Always clued in to the metal fringe, the San Francisco store has long extolled the virtues of Virginia's one-man behemoth Wrnlrd (whose name ""can be pronounced any way you like""), and with good reason. His first five releases (from a nine-part series whose numerical order is tied to a<strong> <a href=""http://www.wrnlrd.com/hypercube.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""hypercube""</a></strong> of mystical concepts) are intriguing mixes of distorted black metal, overloaded riffs, harsh noise, and haunting hints of backwoods acoustics. Entry number six (representing ""mystery, fire, and dreams"")<em> </em>is also release number one for Flingco Sound, the new vinyl-and-digital label helmed by ex-Kranky partner Bruce Adams.</p><p>Though it's not quite as sludgy, <em>Oneiromantical War </em>evokes one of this year's best murky noise-metal LPs, the Goslings' <em>Occasion</em>. Both are drenched in bombed-out atmosphere and tinted with creepy acoustics (the man behind Wrnlrd apparently played bluegrass before he went black metal). But the six melted-together songs<em> </em>here can also be surprisingly straightforward. Every time you think Wrnlrd might have disappeared into noise quicksand, a tight riff and thunderous beat charge forward like a bicep-ripping workout. In fact, most of Wrnlrd's songs are built from basic metal blocks-- often they sound like 10 metal bands overlapping and blurring into howling abstraction.</p>
<p>Most intriguing is how Wrnlrd's huge sound rarely relies on bottom end. Lots of metal uses deep, dark notes to create hypnotic power, but the tone here is generally mid-range, sometimes even trebly. Wrnlrd does visit the low register, as in the shaking ""Breath of Doors"". But even there, everything is bathed in burning fuzz, making it all sound a few octaves higher than whatever key the original chords came from. The effect is a fascinating disorientation-- Wrnlrd's distortion chimes more than it drills, buzzes more than it burrows, and creates a texture that has been rightly compared to the ambient sheens of Fennesz and Tim Hecker.</p>
<p>At times this distortion-addiction can go from entrancing to grating, and it would be tough to call <em>Oneiromantical War </em>ground-breaking, steeped as it is in familiar metal riffs. Even ""War"", a 20-minute album-ending epic that dwarfs the preceding cuts, is more pastiche than original creation. But its journey from metal loops to near-classical bombast to fried atmosphere is intoxicating. It's also a strong indicator that, two-thirds of the way through his ambitious nine-point program, Wrnlrd's vault of ideas is nowhere near empty.</p></div>"|12303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12303-oneiromantical-war/|7.3|Marc Masters

When the duo went to the Ars Electronica summit in 2001, other artists made snide comments about two classically trained musicians at the conference. The women took the academic (and perhaps a little misogynistic) sneering in stride, and their LP, <em>The Messy Jesse Fiesta</em>, snatched second place at the Digital Musics competition. Then they broke up. Parting drove them in unexpected directions: Blechdom moved to Berlin, started writing banjo music, singing live over MIDI, and spreading animal guts on her body as the grand finale of her shows. Blectum moved to San Fransisco, put out solo records, collaborated with other artists, and studied veterinary science. Listening to their latest LPs now, it's hard to believe that Blectum and Blechdom used to be so close that, well, they took essentially the same last name. Or that they used to perform, as the brilliant and ridiculous Blectum From Blechdom, in a custom-made costume that bound them together.<br/><br/><em>Gular Flutter</em>, Blectum's first album in four years, is as indebted to her veterinary studies as it is to her collaboration with Blechdom. The title refers to a part of a bird's throat (ornithology is Blectum's area of specialization), but it's easy to locate animal metaphors all over. Every song has its flutters and tics. Blectum shaves beats so razor thin that they lose their bass-ness and become another light, feathery wafer to stack and arrange. She's clinical in her song-making: Every sound, from fuzzy poofs of static to 8-bit bleeps to the reversed violin (Blectum is classically trained), gets examined under her microscope. Each instrument resides in its own glass case, ready for inspection. On ""Cygnet"" (that's what you call a young swan), eastern drumming and reversed violin go silent every few seconds, as if the song were resetting itself and asking you to choose which passage you prefer. Bird sounds bookend ""Mine"", but it's the next song, ""Flowers Fade Fast"", that is truly bestial, at turns vulgar and writhing, and in that way closer to Blectum From Blechdom than the rest of <em>Gular Flutter</em>. Phantom samples seem to drift through the background of ""Retrice"", whose minute stereo pans require almost total silence to discern.<br/><br/>Blectum also uses her voice here, and though it's not the plaintive, dare-to-hate-me bellow of Blechdom, its nakedness is compelling. ""Mine"" and ""Squeezed"" feel a little more fun, and the slight soul vocal that touches down on the latter loosens Blectum's tight reins. Her voice, along with the violins and contemporary classical passages, give the album a more human feeling. But it's not the human you want more of-- it's the animal-- and occasionally it would be better if Blectum flicked away a few grains of electron detritus and wilded out.</p></div>"|12220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12220-gular-flutter/|7.8|Jessica Suarez

To make matters more irritating, their already dubious shtick was steeped in cookie-cutter post-punk posturing. The album stared down its nose at your while flaunting the most garden variety craftsmanship, the kind of Siouxsie Sioux-inspired goth rock available on every Williamsburg corner. In retrospect, it's clear that Shock Cinema, slapped together from spare parts of several bands, jumped the gun a bit by releasing an awkward EP consisting of a few so-so songs and two remixes. <em>Hell And Highwater</em> jettisons many of the band's gimmicks and showcases a formidable range of songwriting styles and moods, and you don't have to be into something like French surrealist film to appreciate the music.</p><p>Chalk up some of the improvements to a change of scenery. Recorded in San Francisco with Nation of Ulysses/Fucking Champs member Tim Green, the album kicks off with the gloomy Yeah Yeah Yeahs'-inspired rocker ""Leviathan"" but quickly scatters in several directions. Lead singer Destiny Montague isn't digitally processed to sound like she's singing from the depths of hell on every track, and the newfound starkness in her vocals makes a jangly dirge like ""Oddfellow"" sound less like Joy Division or Bauhaus than I.R.S.-era R.E.M. trying their hand at avant-garde. ""Mutineers Reconsider"" makes for a nice point of comparison with <em>Revenge</em>'s hokey ""Art of Noir"", the former handling its precarious dance-punk feel with a lot more discretion and more memorable melody.</p><p>That's not to say Shock Cinema's mastered the art of subtlety. ""Atlas Shrugged"" is as long-winded and overbearing as the eponymous novel, and tracks like ""Lone Islands"" and ""Dead Sea"" are slow burners that build not with musical ideas but additional layers of instruments and cheesy dramatic splashes. Still, <em>Hell</em>'s songs stand on their own much better than previous material, so much so that a bluesy stomper like ""Wax Wings"" doesn't even sound related to the other YYY/Kills-like numbers here. The uniform pallor that sanded <em>Revenge </em>down into one constant, anti-climactic sneer doesn't afflict Shock Cinema's latest effort, and even if they're still struggling to carve their own niche in post-punk-- or at least find an exciting single-- they're much closer to doing so than they were 12 months ago.</p></div>"|12223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12223-hell-and-highwater/|6.4|Adam Moerder

Lots of weird tics, art-school tropes, music theory indulgences-- and yet the San Francisco quartet has steadily veered closer<em> </em>to accessibility the past of couple years. Not that any of their albums ever logically followed each other, but in three years they've managed to custom fit Satomi Matsuzaki's screwy vocals with honest-to-god melodies (<em>Milk Man</em>), consistently tug at heartstrings with those melodies (<em>The Runners Four</em>), and then wrap that package into slick, replicable three-minute pop structures (<em>Friend Opportunity</em>). What more can you ask for from a rock band?<br/><br/>Well, how about bigger guitars? With newly added guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Ed Rodriguez on board, the band recaptures the dual guitar interplay of previous albums and then some. I'm not talking about namby-pamby prog fiddling, either; there's legit Pete Townshend-style windmilling here, from the ""Rockin' Me"" bite on opener ""The Tears and Music of Love"" to the Chuck Berry seventh chords that propel the ""Fresh Born"" verses. Inevitably, Satomi gets intertwined in all this, yet never lost. There's still a melodic quality to <em>Maggie</em>, and it can still sound pretty and coherent at times, but the album's heartbeat is six-stringed and often distorted. Don't worry though, Deerhoof haven't pulled the plug on their pop tangent. They're just folding their canon on itself, taking the songwriting tricks they've learned during the last handful of albums and applying them to a raw rock aesthetic somewhere between <em>Reveille </em>and <em>Apple O'</em>.<br/><br/>Deerhoof's never fully taken the plunge into electronics, but <em>Maggie</em>'s trace amounts of techno-lalia are egregious. The album's all fretboard, no circuit board, and it feels most comfortable that way. Removed from the grid, the band's music follows a much more organic path, and it's interesting to note how seemingly scattershot bleeps and bloops on prior releases actually kept the songs relatively grounded. The album's second half best demonstrates this, its song structures vine-like, twisting and turning rather than firing off/on like a transistor. The dual guitar lines sneak up on each other in ""Numina O"" and closer ""Jagged Fruit"", and even if listeners have no clue what's coming next, they never get the feeling they're about to get sucker-punched.<br/><br/>Satomi follows suit, projecting a very biological and terrestrial sound. Past allusions to time travel, robots, and outer space are replaced with themes of the flesh as <em>Maggie </em>covers ""The Tears and Music of Love"", ""Family of Others"", ""Fresh Born"", and even basketball. Also, while Satomi's voice hasn't deepened any, she certainly sounds less like a hyperglycemic/hyperactive little girl and more sage. Her vocal phrases are at their longest and most reserved here, patiently straddling the lead guitar of ""Chandelier Searchlight"" or Middle Eastern tumble of ""Buck and Judy"" for several measures before delivering a payoff hook. And though she often sings lockstep with Rodriguez and Dieterich, it's not the same hand-holding as <em>Reveille</em>-era Deerhoof. Satomi may sing in unison with the guitars, but she also shows the ability to establish mood. Her opening line, ""Tell me about your purple past,"" on ""My Purple Past"" is at once both curious pillow talk and hard-boiled interrogation, and the song's coy chorus only leaves you feeling less at ease.<br/><br/>Despite these adjustments, <em>Maggie </em>is hardly a new animal within the Deerhoof canon. It's got all sorts of earmarks, from the token Greg Saunier Beach Boys homage ""Family of Others"" to the irritating hopscotch cadence of ""Basket Ball Get Your Groove Back"", this album's Shaggs-like ""Kidz Are So Small"" or ""Dog on the Sidewalk"". And even with all its perfectly nailed mid-tempo ballads, which filled the gooey center of the past two 'hoof releases, <em>Maggie </em>balks at the chance to make your knees go wobbly, keeping its allure strictly intellectual and technical rather than hot-blooded. That ethos isn't going to win a lot of hugs and kisses from fans or non-fans, but <em>Maggie </em>never asks for more than a firm, professional handshake, the kind of appreciation it more than deserves.</p></div>"|12310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12310-offend-maggie/|7.6|Adam Moerder

Last we heard from Eric Bachmann-- in 2006, when he released the lyrically grim (even by his misery-loving standards) solo record<em> To the Races</em>-- the guy was living out of his van. By choice, according to the musician, but still. So despite culling a decent following over the course of four solid Crooked Fingers full-lengths and a superlative covers EP-- and shored-up by a road warrior work ethic-- Bachmann's decision to hawk this one himself is somewhat risky.<br/><br/>He's made <em>Fortfeit/Fortune</em> available in four formats via his website and also through iTunes and two dozen hand-picked independent brick &amp; mortars. So fans who only spend their dollars at the Walton family company store and other mom-and-pop-crushing big boxes are out of luck. (Buy independent, y'all!) There are no hard feelings between Bachmann and recent Crooked Fingers label Merge (a relief, because if you can't count on Merge to do right by artists, hardened skeptics and rabid new paradigm types are right, and labels really are obsolete). Though even a savvy indie with a battalion of crack publicists might not know how to sell this oversalted stew. Typically corralled into the Americana pen, Crooked Fingers has for some time owed more to Iberian (and more recently, Eastern European) folk, contemporary Anglo-American singer/songwriter conventions, and punk rock, than Appalachian ballads, Nashville, or Neil Young. And on previous album, 2005's <em>Dignity and Shame</em>, the loosely cobbled band's strange brew went down reasonably well.<br/><br/>Now, imagine that concoction several shots stronger and a whiff past its consume-by date. Bombastic, Boss-baiting opener ""What Never Comes"" has Bachmann emitting a teeth-grinding burr while the track's airless mix is smothered with sax solos. Not a promising start to an album but hey, if it's ever filmed, <em>St. Elmo's Fire II</em> has its theme! Next, ""Luisa's Bones"" imposes flamenco fancy dress on an otherwise charming drum-machined pop song winsomely sung by Elin Palmer, and Spanish motifs reassert themselves on ""Phony Revolutions"", ""No Me Lo Des!"", and the unfortunate ""Sinisteria"", which I can only guess is about Lou Reed chatting up Tom Waits in an Andalusian karaoke bar. Devotchka's Tom Hagerman lends his gypsy strings to ""Let's Not Pretend (To Be New Men)""'s funereal drone and ""Modern Dislocation"" pays tepid tribute to commercial alternative radio. Just running down the tracklist is exhausting.¬†¬†¬† <br/><br/>Bachmann's a good songwriter and musician with some exceptional credits-- ""New Drink for the Old Drunk"", ""Devil's Train"", ""Angelina"", and ""Andalucia"", to name a few post-Archers highlights. And downer that it is, <em>To the Races</em> is a beautiful record: thoughtful, patient, spacious, and sparingly embellished. So among<em> Forfeit/Fortune</em>'s many misses, Bachmann can't help but hit a few. Neko Case guests on the synth-swamped new wave duet ""Your Control"", her cognac alto leavening Bachmann‚Äôs salt-and-vinegar baritone. And ""Cannibals"", the kind of weary, late-night, last-call rocker that could get your drunk, lazy ass moving, is also decent (even if it recycles bits of <em>Dignity and Shame</em>'s ""Call to Love"").<br/><br/>Here's where record reviewers usually say something about transition albums, and from a practical, economic standpoint, <em>Forfeit/Fortune</em> is certainly that. But considering Bachmann's always been a restless soul and every Crooked Fingers release is arguably a travelogue dispatched from the road to a radically different follow-up, transition talk would only be making lame excuses for a disappointing record.</p></div>"|12309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12309-forfeitfortune/|5.2|Amy Granzin

On each of her beguiling albums, Molina has dissected and detailed the individual components of songs not just as rhythms or melodies or words, but as malleable sounds-- sounds that collide, connect, and complement one another. Her music is pop song as bricolage, the whole greater than the sum of its sometimes conventional, often unusual parts. <br/><br/>Yet at the same time, Molina's works, for all their intricacies and novel intersections of electronic and organic, are undeniably subtle, and, like a complex collage relegated to the background, potentially ignored other than by those few curious enough to stop and take a closer look. As successful as she's been, Molina's likely at least a little frustrated that the easy on the ears results perhaps overshadow the discipline and invention behind them. Molina possibly designed her fifth album, <em>Un D√≠a</em>, to counter that perception.</p><p>Unlike its predecessors, <em>Un D√≠a</em> is less a dinner-party record and more of a conversation piece itself. Here Molina further abstracts her songs, emphasizing more than ever dense hypnotic repetition and the forceful impact of sound itself, sometimes at the expense of the more traditional elements that have always rooted her music. The title track features layers of cascading noises and sonic elements added until the track approaches a cacophonous din. ""Vive Solo"" is more toned down, but Molina's vocals are still almost subsumed by the rhythms, at once indebted to South America and the 70s minimalists. Her singing here serves as a sort of breathy thematic thread linking the various polyrhythms, a living loop changing and modulating itself without veering too far out of range.. <br/><br/>Molina's singing ultimately takes an even more supporting role on ""Lo Dejamos"", which tosses in jazz and rumbling sub-woofer friendly drones. It's the perfect lead into ""Los Hongos de Marosa"", one of the disc's highlights, which is propelled along by a circular acoustic guitar pattern as Molina ladles on the effects and electronics, not unlike the best techno deconstructionists, only from a more tactile perspective. Here, the laptop is the key, not the door itself, and Molina uses the technology to open new passageways through which to slip, leading the listener along with her by the hand. Certainly she sounds as engaged as ever with the intersection of man and machine, as heard in the entrancing overlap of synths and looped cooing that ends ""¬øQui√©n? (Suite)"", nearly mushed together into one intriguing compound patch. <br/><br/><em>Un D√≠a</em> is as warm and welcoming as it is weird, but it's also something of an experiment, as delineated by the irresistible statement of purpose conveniently included within the title track (and, translated, in the press notes): ""One day I will sing the songs with no lyrics,"" Molina sings, ""and everyone can imagine for themselves if it's about love, disappointment, banalities or about Plato."" <em>Un D√≠a</em><em></em> marks one firm step forward in that regard. It's like sentences with the punctuation marks left out, all the more rewarding for its contradictory incompleteness. Everything's in its right place, but your ear-- and brain-- still struggle to make total sense of even the simplest ideas. It's not perfect, but it's progress.</p></div>"|12297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12297-un-dia/|7.5|Joshua Klein

His folk-electronic hybrids have often romanticized death, which isn't the same thing as honoring it. But for <em>City of </em><em>Refuge</em>-- which is really no city at all-- Raposa decamped, alone, to a tiny desert outpost in Nevada, away from Brooklyn, away from social interaction. The resulting album is appropriately barren and full of spirits. You can tell Raposa was scoured clean by the desert: This is his most nakedly honest record.</p><p>But here's the thing about deeply personal artifacts: Sometimes, they don't communicate. To investigate yourself through music without regard for audience is very worthwhile. But such an artifact can fit strangely into the commerce stream, where different imperatives apply, and where <em>City of </em><em>Refuge</em><em> </em>now resides. When I listen to it, I find myself feeling glad for Raposa that he made it, while wondering what I'm supposed to do with it. He's speaking to himself in a code so deep and personal it scans as almost autistic. Hearing it feels more like voyeurism than dialogue.</p><p><em>City of Refuge</em> hangs together oddly-- in fact, it barely hangs together at all. Stern electronic set pieces, high-desert guitar arrangements, and morose folk songs intermingle without discernible rhyme or reason. As a result, the album fits no particular mood, hobbled by awkward pacing. It contains a number of admirable tracks, but its packaging and sale as an album is problematic. The overdubbed cameos from Sufjan Stevens, Jana Hunter, and others add a sheen of completion, but fail to bind it together. It works best in small doses, and might have been more sensibly released as individual tracks via the Internet.</p>
<p>The most interesting tracks are the simplest ones. Guitar overture ""Celestial Shore"" sounds like the national anthem of some sad, dusty country. ""High Plain 1"" sends scraps of delayed guitar ricocheting off the walls. ""The Destroyer"" is a seductive dirge for reverbed arpeggios and wobbly percussion. But sequenced consecutively, these three compelling tracks just seem erratic, especially when they let out into more run-of-the-mill Castanets tracks (""Prettiest Chain"" and ""Refuge 1"") where Raposa's voice, distant and brassy as always,¬†finally appears. Elsewhere, a work of purely abstract interference (""High Plain 3"") sits next to an earnest cover of the hymn ""I'll Fly Away""; a psychedelic guitar jam (""The Quiet"") next to a simple acoustic tune (""Glory B"").</p>
<p><em>City of Refuge</em> seems more like a collection of ideas for three or four different albums than one complete work. I find Raposa's electronic improvisations more interesting than his songs, and would love to hear an album where he explores them more fully. And maybe Raposa is primed to make something more focused, having gotten this lost diary disguised as a record-- sometimes intriguing, sometimes banal, often incomprehensible-- out of his system.</p></div>"|12306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12306-city-of-refuge/|5.6|Brian Howe

<p>Within mere months, Elliott has released not one but two full-length albums. The first, <i>A Picture of the Three of Us at the Gate to the Garden of Eden</i>, is a collaboration with David Strackany (aka Paleo) that sounds a bit like the Postal Service and a bit like Beck's blues-folk albums from the 90s. The follow-up, <i>Crimes</i>, puts Elliott in front of a full band and was recorded in less than a week in Lexington, Kentucky. <i>Picture</i> is the primaries, <i>Crimes</i> the general election, but as different as they are from one another, neither sounds like an entirely satisfying expression of Elliott's talent or vision.</p>
<p><i>Picture</i>, the more ambitious of the pair, simply sounds unfocused, overly concerned with effects and production-- with moments and sounds-- than with songs or overall shape. Creaking boards and soft keys set the pensive tone on opener ""Preface: Painless"", then ""First Sight"" mixes guitar with Strackany's electronic burbles and Elliott's exaggeratedly poetic lyrics: ""The cataracts-ed alley cat spat back at the moon, thrown out into the nighttime/ Nine lifetimes too soon."" I could quote similarly unfathomable and overwritten passages from just about every song, which would be okay if they were bolstered by memorable hooks.

<p>As its succinct title suggests, <i>Crimes</i> is a much more focused and slightly more rousing effort.

Not well and not often, at least. That's what she says. I didn't learn of her insomnia for months after <em>In Advance of the Broken Arm</em> was released last February. But in retrospect, it made sense: When I first heard her music, I couldn't sleep either.</p><p><em>In Advance</em> opened with an eight-note guitar figure, cycled 32 times in half a minute-- about eight and a half notes a second. A brutal, highly repetitive pop song ensued. Marnie shrieked and trembled. Her rhythm section (Hella's Zach Hill) egged her on-- she juggled fire; he hosed her with gasoline to cool her off. She made hysteria sound hypnotic.</p><p>What set her apart, though, wasn't showmanship, or even hooks-- it was her vulnerability.

Her music didn't just aim to impress, but to move. For a couple of weeks, I thought of her as an emotive technician, but it became clear she was something else: A dizzy heir to Sleater-Kinney, or Helium-- arty, feminine guitar-rock that infiltrated Guyville without a mission statement.</p>
<p>Her second album's title,<em> This Is It and I Am It and You Are It and So Is That and He Is It and She Is It and It Is It a</em><em></em><em>nd That Is That</em> isn't one you have to read more than once. But it sums Stern up. It's obsessive and choppy. It's playful. It's gleefully oblivious of when to shut up. But its obliviousness is crucial-- the music, like the title (a reference to the religious philosopher Alan Watts), implies a loop or a meditative void.</p>
<p>She still strikes Van Halen and AC/DC poses. Her guitar parts still crisscross and crosshatch, her vocals are still shrill, and both are overdubbed relentlessly. Hill still implies a groove without sparing his kit any violence, but not enough to actually sound like he's <em>grooving, </em>which would be anathema to music this wired. As a group, though, there's a new sense of self-assuredness. She's learned when to flex and glint, and when to lean in the cut. ""The Crippled Jazzer"", ""The Package is Wrapped,"" and the album-closing ""The Devil Is in the Details"" get so comfortable they break into a strut-- a far cry from <em>In Advance.</em></p>
<p>In a way, that's reassuring-- while energy is essential to her music, it's not the only force at work. It'd be a shame to see her subsist solely on hammer-ons. But learning to relax and record in a real studio-- as opposed to her bedroom-- hasn't compromised Stern's singular talent: to make the work of one sound like the joy of many.</p>
<p><em>In Advance</em> was an album primarily about how hard Stern had to push herself to make it. The lines read like they were collaged from self-help, pop-Buddhism, and sports memoir. She was a cheerleader possessed. The newfound musical openness on <em>This Is It</em> is mirrored in lyrics that seem to actually account for people other than herself. ""What I need now is a good feeling to let me know""-- that's a promise. ""I'm hoping it's true/ I'm hoping for you, you, you""-- that's a declaration. By the time the album reaches ""The Devil Is in the Details"", it's hard to imagine Stern as someone who quit her job to sweat over a portastudio in the middle of the night. ""The devil is in the details if you are ready,"" she challenges. She ends the album on a precipice, which, I guess, is how she should-- with miles to go before we sleep.</p></div>"|12272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12272-this-is-it-and-i-am-it-and-you-are-it-and-so-is-that-and-he-is-it-and-she-is-it-and-it-is-it-and-that-is-that/|8.3|Mike Powell

The man whose kitschy celebrity comes from the serenity of his voice and his homespun DIY inclinations (first-page YouTube results for Ross are mostly parodies, which is sort of sad). These aren't exactly the initial associations I'd want people making at the Best Buy new music endcap, but fortunately for Annuals and their listeners, <em>Such Fun</em> is nearly the opposite of serene populism. As on the moderately more enjoyable <em>Be He Me</em>, Adam Baker and his band are hellbent on disorienting their listeners, through nailing erratic bouts of punk and prog onto self-pitying balladry and slack-jawed country, and inflating songs to oft-ridiculous sizes before returning them to their original states. For the cover art, maybe an off-his-meds folk collage artist might have been more true-to-form.<br/><br/>Baker co-produced <em>Fun</em> with Jacquire King, most known for his skill in wrangling iconoclastic rural eccentrics like Tom Waits and Isaac Brock, and making them sound full and modern while still anxious and/or nostalgic. King also helmed Kings of Leon's most recent effort, though, and while there are vague echoes of Brock in Baker's mercurial emotions on <em>Fun</em>, bigness and a borderline gimmicky connection to rurality remain the overriding aesthetics. ""Hot Night Hounds"" is a perfect example: An opening jittery piano figure is augmented <em>ad infinitum </em>as the two keep tacking shit onto it like untrained carpenters making a mansion out of a motor home. What starts as <em>The Soft Bulletin</em> somehow ends as Faith No More, and one of the song's recommendable traits is that it holds together without collapsing.  <br/><br/>That's the Annuals' schtick of course, and it would be unfair to expect them to suddenly switch gears, even for an ostensibly larger audience. Opening track ""Confessor"" recalls earlier single ""Dry Clothes"", and ""Springtime"" and ""Hardwood Floor"" come directly from the band's post-<em>Funeral</em> blueprint: calmness turning into a tempest and coming back again, one of Baker's vocal halves screaming at the peaceful one, old-timey instrumentation. ""Floor"" blooms into the sort of vocabled ethnic chant the band is enamored of, and ""Springtime"" recalls an even more bombastic update of Fleetwood Mac's ""Tusk"", which isn't a bad thing. While <em>Fun</em> is far from a collection of happy little trees created with a magic putty knife, the element of surprise that rendered <em>Be He Me</em> so invigorating has been repurposed and lessened.<br/><br/>But there are other moves on <em>Fun</em> that show the band directing its plentiful energy in a different, intriguing direction. ""Down the Mountain"" merges hyperactive hillbilly (complete with fiddles and ambient country sound effects) with a chorus aimed at the mall-emo contingent, to which Baker's youthful timbre is perfectly suited. Dark, chugging guitars surround a howled question more petulant than plaintive: ""How could you take my only answer?!"" A bit later, ""Talking"" takes ""Mountain"" to one extreme-- it's a densely produced, riff-laden pop-punk song, within which the stately elements (soaring guitars, proclamatory brass) manage to fit.¬† Both herald a new direction, but not too far of a stretch: After all, My Chemical Romance and Arcade Fire have much more in common than a vocal contingent of indie bluebloods would like to admit.<br/><br/>And that's where Annuals find themselves now: In that liminal stage between online indiedom, where fans assume they've organically nurtured bands and pushed them out into the world, and the equally precarious niche-based realm of a major's experimental micro-label. <em>Such Fun</em> ends with ""Wake"", perhaps the prettiest and most focused song on the album, with a well-earned and satisfying crescendo at the close. ""Wake"" is one of many indications that Annuals might well have it within themselves (though maybe in spite of themselves) to rein it in a notch and reach for that ever-more elusive monocultural consensus moment, one that might occasion their relocation from Canvasback's pay-weekly condo into more permanent housing. For the time being, though, they'll make do bunking with Manchester Orchestra.</p></div>"|12300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12300-such-fun/|6.6|Eric Harvey

His noise-inflected collage-pop is a far cry from the sad-eyed new folk of many of his labelmates. Then again, the producer/jingle maker/experimenter seems so unselfconscious, so committed to the notion of music-as-fun, he could probably fit in almost anywhere. His songs-- brief, genre-defiant explosions wrapped in tight melodies-- reflect a similar feeling of brazen enjoyment and abandon.</p>
<p>On this year's <i>Sex Death Cassette,</i> Rafter used an anything-goes approach to burn through material. Stirring together Caribbean, funk, and classic indie rock elements together at a breakneck pace, its 19 tracks clocked in at just 35 minutes. <i>Sex Death Cassette</i> was a blast, and has been rightly commended for injecting some lightheartedness into indie rock. But at such high velocities, it was hard to get a grasp of Rafter the artist, whether there was more to him than captivatingly produced fun-pop. His <i>Sweaty Magic </i> EP-- a much more groove-focused affair than <i>Cassette</i>-- doesn't clear any of that up. He's not interested in revealing more of himself. Rafter simply wants you to boogie. And have sex.</p>
<p>And on a placeholder EP, that's okay by me. So <i>Sweaty Magic</i> takes its cues from Beck in <i>Midnite Vultures</i> mode, Chromeo, and other campy, libidinous dance acts, and is purely a blithe (and unabashed) party record. It lacks any consistent narrative thread; its songs jut into one another at random, and its lyrics (e.g. ""Salt""'s vague, repeated instruction to ""Put some salt on it."" Um, on <i>what</i>?) are often unclear. It's also kind of awesome.</p>
<p>Part of what makes the record work is Rafter's commitment to form-- <i>Sweaty Magic</i> rarely veers from its wacky, Zapp &amp; Roger-meets-Prince vibe. Songs ooze with sleazy sensuality: ""Sassy"" flips a Quincy Jones-produced Michael Jackson number inside out, putting distorted synths, boom-bap drums, and heavy bass upfront to let its funky guitars do the dirty talking. On ""Sweat"", Rafter sets his clean vocal harmonies atop cowbell percussion and a G-Funk era beat for hilarious, smoothed-out effect. ""Magic"", meanwhile, aims directly for the club. Its clattering beats and madcap synths ride a propulsive rhythm that fulfills his goal of shameless danceability.</p>
<p>At the core of these retro-inspired dance tracks, though, is devotion to melody and structure. This is why Rafter can get away with what some might call cheesiness. He's jettisoned the lo-fi patches of fuzz that ran throughout <i>Cassette</i>, and this EP is cleaner and sharper because of it. Even on ""Noise"", the album's most atonal track, he complements the jagged verses with tunefulness-- a catchy guitar riff swoops in just before things become grating. ""Juicy"", the closest thing to a ballad, also showcases Rafter's capable production. Built above an acoustic guitar loop, squelching keys, and vocoder sections, the song remains crisp and potent despite its divergent instrumentation. Because of its multifarious song types-- leftfield club thumpers, futuristic sex ditties, and funky space jams-- some will contend that <i>Sweaty Magic</i> lacks cohesion, that it's too ADD to be listenable, but I would argue that is precisely Rafter's point. Like Gregg Gillis' Girl Talk project, Rafter here is the opposite of a serious artist, aiming only to create something that is immediate and sexy, and <i>Sweaty Magic</i>'s erratic quality simply mirrors our own pop-drenched culture of endless options.</p></div>"|12267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12267-sweaty-magic/|7.5|Joe Colly

Tampa MCs Shunda K and Jwl. B make their names as outfront lesbians in a pop scene where an empty <em>Maxim</em> fantasy vessel like Katy Perry is considered sexually transgressive, and details of Yo Majesty's live shows-- Bacardi-fueled wild-out energy, rocking mics topless like LL, beats that made crunk and hip-house scissor each other-- led me to think of them as an idea whose time had come. Here was something rap had sorely lacked: kickass women who appreciate a booty clap as much as the fellas but are also completely unafraid to knock a misogynist's dick in the dirt.</p><p>It's a hell of a background, which makes it that much more disappointing at how disjointed their full-length debut, <em>Futuristically Speaking...Never Be Afraid</em>, tends to sound. Earlier this year, Yo Majesty dropped the five-track <em>Kryptonite Pussy </em>EP, and in that compact context they sounded full of promise, focused, and fierce and often hilarious over an ideal retro-modern mix of Miami bass, classic electro, and modern house. <em>Futuristically Speaking </em>still has flashes of that excitement, thanks to a usually-high energy level and heavy production input from longtime collaborators Hard Feelings UK that does its best to keep things focused on ass-shaking beats. And Basement Jaxx chip in a bit of their time to contribute one of the best beats on the album, ""Booty Klap"", which pushes ghettotech into blown-out absurdity without actually making a patronizing joke out of it. (Bonus: One of the most enthusiastic, giddy deliveries of the word ""booty"" you'll ever want to hear.)</p><p>Shunda K and Jwl. B are taut MCs, at their best shouting deceptively simple hooks that drop into motormouthed liquid flows or sleek harmonies without warning. And they've got a good handle on balancing rebellious agitation with a fixation on getting off; ""Night Riders"" has a neat bait-and-switch that turns a late-nite cruising anthem into an indictment of police brutality and poverty, and ""Hott"" sums up their approach to sex with one provocative question: ""You ever have an orgasm while you're pissed?"" But a fair amount of the record fails to play to their strengths, often times by putting them in the middle of unexpected genre exercises, and stylistic digressions like the furious, violent punk rock tirade ""Fucked Up"", downtempo funk cut ""Get Down on the Floor"", and the semi-acoustic R&amp;B slow jam ""Buy Love"" feel so out of place it's actually kind of hard to tell that they're not actually bad songs. (That's more than you can say for the title track, where their 4/4 flows and the offbeat time signature of Sunship's production never really seem to mesh.)</p>
<p>Disjointed as it is, there's still a solid half hour of get-wild anthems inside this uneven 55 minutes. Sticking it out to the end provides some highlights: ""Grindin' and Shakin'"" bumps like an M.I.A. production stripped down to a clattering, stomping drumline and a great titular hook, ""Club Action"" is a Detroit-style cut that features a chant of ""fuck that shit"" delivered, amusingly enough, over a strictly vestigial censor beep, and ""Take It Away"" closes things out like an unusually tight version of JJ Fad tweaked for the E'd up post-Missy generation. If you took the best half of <em>Futuristically Speaking</em> and appended it to <em>Kryptonite Pussy</em>, you'd have a damn good hour-long party record, and getting over a dozen hot tracks from Yo Majesty within a year is proof enough that there's plenty of weight to their potential.</p></div>"|12290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12290-futuristically-speakingnever-be-afraid/|6.7|Nate Patrin

Doing all of the above is rare, however-- as is making each stray verse or hiccup as arresting as the one before it-- but volcano! manage this on their second record, <em>Paperwork</em>, even better than they did on their debut, <em>Beautiful Seizure</em>.</p><p>The mercurial three-piece may now be more cohesive, consistent, and focused, but volcano!'s unpredictability is <em>Paperwork</em>'s biggest strength. ""'78 Oil Crisis"" starts slow with incidental noises, but it settles into a streamlined, linear melody, until the intermittent spasms of guitar become almost calming. A theremin tone anchors the grinding and coughing of ""Sweet Tooth"" as it grows more paranoid and mechanical, and later makes an insistent earworm from bent-out-of-tune guitar notes. ""Astronomer's Ballad"" is a doe-eyed Spanish-language serenade that eventually devolves into tightly controlled chaos. None is quite as stunning as the graceful and evocative ""Palimpsests"", whose well-tamed fuzz-guitar line and increased patter of drums makes With's taps-like call to ""wake up, wake up"" seem like a test of strength.<br/><br/>The arrhythmic, stuttering beat and meandering melody of ""Performance Evaluation Shuffle"" is not the first song to send up cubicle culture, but few have sounded so suffocated and desperate. ""Africa Just Wants to Have Fun"" shows off the many modes of volcano! but flows more naturally than some of their other freewheeling material. The verse gradually builds to a brassy, step-ladder melody, which progresses to a damn-near funky staccato guitar line, as singer/songwriter Aaron With uses every bit of his elastic vocal range to lampoon Bono, most pointedly over the buzzing bass keyboards in its bridge (""Won't you make up your mind/ Are you bored or inspired... You're acting like Christ on the cross/ You look ridiculous"").</p><p>As with many tracks on <em>Paperwork</em>, the floor drops out of ""Tension Loop"", but the percussion skitters along with impressive precision, never losing the pulse. The song emerges from gentle drums and a soft, busy guitar plucking, finally torn apart by jagged samples and electronic manipulation that go from pretty to hair-raising, while With's tempered croon grounds the song (with only minimal yodeling). ""Slow Jam"" (which is anything but) is the record's biggest gamble, a falsetto-laden ode to impotence.</p>
<p>Lord knows why ""Kitchen Dance"" ends it all with a half-sigh, offering all the band's tricks-- bi-lingual crooning, keyboards that go from whisper to scream, double-time drums that spike the pulse-- without any of the pacing, charm, or measure of the rest of the album. But without volcano!'s occasional over-indulgence, this record would be half as interesting. Even compared to the convulsive and ambitious pop of their better-established peers like Deerhoof, volcano! are set apart by their fearlessness.</p></div>"|12238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12238-paperwork/|7.9|Jason Crock

Both images handily allude to the morbid singer's dramatic cabaret and gender fluidity.</p><p>Furthering the correspondence, both albums open with piano-driven prayers for death, which, in Antony's parlance, can be interpreted as references to transformation more than physical demise. On <em>Bird</em>, it was ""Hope There's Someone"", where the identity-obsessed singer feared neither life nor death, but ""the middle place/ Between light and nowhere."" On <em>Another World</em>, it's the title track, which finds him similarly stranded in transition-- ""I need another world/ This one's nearly gone""-- while preemptively missing the plants, animals, and people of the world he's straining to escape. In other words, it's metamorphosis he both craves and fears, and both songs are perfectly poised between those two emotions.</p><p>""Hope There's Someone""¬†climaxed with a churning piano that implied the moment of passage, but ""Another World"" has no such epiphany. The tentative melody tiptoes behind distant feedback, never climaxing and never resolving. This is important because it represents the major difference between <em>Bird </em>and <em>Another World</em>-- on the former, Antony shook the rafters with his multi-tiered voice at regular intervals, but here he's more restrained. ""Shake that bird right out of me,"" he murmurs on ""Shake that Devil"", clipping his own wings to find out what he can do at ground level, down here with the rest of us. At first, <em>Another World</em> sounds like a handful of what would have been deep cuts on <em>Bird</em>, and you might miss the flashy crescendos. But it only takes a few spins to get over that and discover these remarkable songs for what they are.</p>
<p>Antony has been compared to Arthur Russell for his downtown affiliations and the elaborate fragility of his voice. Here, he really earns that comparison, not just echoing Russell's <em>Another Thought</em> with the EP's title, but with the eclectic set pieces it contains. <em>I Am a Bird</em> <em>Now </em>spanned gospel, doo-wop, and R&amp;B, but Antony's vocal histrionics often overshadowed genre specificity; <em>Bird</em> sounds downright monolithic compared to <em>Another World</em>'s five concise songs. Their bare-bones arrangements put the emphasis right where it should be-- on Antony's lush, quavering voice, which can now keep apace without hysterics-- and profit from an ambiguity that fits his mercurial persona to a T.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks Antony's devoid of humor¬†should consider to lyrics like ""Poor me/ Little rivers from my hands pool at the bottom of the stairs."" That self-skewering yet heartfelt line launches ""Crackagen"", and implies a streak of self-awareness. With just a ""poor me"" at the beginning, the personal mythology Antony stages amid sustain-heavy piano and drawling strings (there are cities in his eyes; rainwater in his father's) gains an arch undertone to its stirring melodrama. ""Shake that Devil"" is a terrific hybrid of Xiu Xiu-style drone-pop, revival-tent gospel, and free-jazz horn skronk-- the tautest, leanest song in Antony's catalog. Its metaphysical barnyard lyrics could easily fit on a Joanna Newsom record; it essentially amounts to a casting out of malevolent spirits-- a secular exorcism that often seems to be Antony's primary motivation for making music.</p>
<p>Antony writes songs for the sake of escaping, either personally or by proxy, from whatever image of him they capture.¬†Forget Arthur Russell for a sec: He's half Scott Walker, half Harry Houdini. On the halting ballad ""Sing for Me"", he builds a garden wall only to vanish over it, and on the uplifting madrigal ""Hope Mountain"", the titular peak is a nest for ""scores of soaring eagles,"" making it a mere launching pad for things that leave, things that change. This EP is a teaser for a forthcoming full-length, which will surely give us yet another incarnation of Antony. Even now, this new record represents an afterimage or whatever trace of himself Antony could capture while rifling through different guises. But¬†we all¬†know a little something about chasing that ideal version of ourselves, and Antony's persistence in the face of futility makes it a joy to run by his side.</p></div>"|12295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12295-another-world-ep/|8.0|Brian Howe

He leaves his audiences to discern (or project) trails and patterns among the far-flung crumbs of his intentions. The release date probably has more to do with September 19 than November 4 (or September 11, for that matter), since a¬†featured track is ""National Talk Like a Pirate Day"", and besides, the majority of Lambchop platters¬†register as¬†autumnal-to-wintry. The artwork was chosen to provide synergistic exposure to Wagner's grad-school mentor Michael Peed, and anyway, its naked lovers (like Wagner's lyrical personae) are choosing the balm of their mutual absorption over engagement with the brutal complications outside. <em>OH</em> knows that the bedroom, and one's interior landscape, provide the¬†true battleground states.</p><p>As for covering Don Williams' dopey ""I Believe In You""-- well, Wagner has always loved that kind of cool-less country, and stylistically, <em>OH</em> is kind of a Lambchop Legacy Revue, revisiting sounds from every long-player in their discography except for the symphonic lounge stylings of that particularly heralded one from the year 2000, the one whose critical static-cling Wagner griped about at the conclusion of his last album. So no wonder this acutely variegated disc ends with an almost too-lackadaisical take on a tune dating back to a certain unpopular administration: As his listeners suffer through the last days of Bush, Wagner's still got <em>Nixon</em> fatigue.</p>
<p>The man's vocals never fail to pique. Perhaps more than ever before Wagner belts here as if accompanying-- and equaling-- a master¬†with either a distinct mode or a legendary range. You know, like, in my brains, I'm a dead ringer for Chet Baker <em>while a Chet Baker album is also playing</em>, but solo, my mimicky breathmatazz comes about as close to Chetness as Wagner does to sirs Orbison, Como, Redding, and Kristofferson, from whom he seems to be taking enunciatory, respiratory, and time-management cues. He mostly sells it, though, and one dreams of being able to witness some sort of cross-sectioned live-action sonogram of his upper body, with a karaoke ball revealing from where in his gut, gullet, or jowls he is making those unconventionally expressive noises: the deep whispers, wobbly sermons, and bothered whines, often within a single verse.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Wagner's found ways to self-deprecate and hold forth about the failure of utterance without handing critics hammers with which to bonk him. (Recent offerings almost always contained at least one track so self-consciously frustrated with articulation that it begged the question, ""Then dude, why not stop yammering?"") Longtime fans might even find him curiously sober, profanity-free, and un-ornery; it's not difficult to imagine Wagner's former fussbudget selves being embarrassed by some of this album's almost cheerful pleas of devotion.</p>
<p>Witnessing the tension between Lambchop's linguistic splatter-painting and the deliberateness of the musicianship is, as always, a blast. Wagner sort of punk'd producers Roger Moutenot and Mark Nevers into recording rival drafts of the album, and then he chose his favorites. Um, Moutenot kills it: His tracks capture and emphasize every dynamic of the performances. The guitars are slapped and scraped, but retain their fluidity. The drums and keys serve as atmospheric lectures¬†for Daniel Lanois on how to occasionally turn some levels down, while¬†""Popeye""'s coda is pure kinetic-but-dour sophistication, making me wish that Lambchop would tutor Jeff Tweedy not only on penning panoramic miniatures, but on when and why to art-rock responsibly.</p>
<p>""Popeye"" also has me thinking that Wagner is contemporary music's Robert Altman, from his comfort with starless ensemblery to his disinterest in conventional ""impact."" Each new Lambchop record glacially redefines the maturity of the previous one, but Wagner's the rare cult leader unpreoccupied with recruitment, and I could see folks being nonplussed by an act for which meandering is the point, and who essentially make no-stakes high art. (Plus, penultimate cut ""Close Up and Personal"" may tragically be the first to succumb to the Lambchop paradox-- I love me some dissonance, but that arrangement is just too pretty for Wagner's clipped honk.) Consider <em>OH</em> the ""most Lambchop"" of Lambchop releases, as it swings through almost every tone in the band's history of influence-collisions, arriving at a soul of its own.</p></div>"|12304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12304-oh-ohio/|7.9|William Bowers

It's that overwhelming. Though it's almost a cosmic convergence that Sic Alps have landed on the Siltbreeze label for their latest LP, <em>U.S. EZ</em>, they stand a step or two apart from their more hotly-tipped peers, as they recall bands from much further back (past the early 1990s, even!). Their primitive riffery belies hours of mining for dusty psychedelic nuggets while their simple and strange recording style calls back to the earliest rock'n'roll, as does the direct, innocent spirit found in many of these songs.</p><p>Still, this is new territory for the band. Sludgy and spare as they may be, Sic Alps do know how to write pop songs, and <em>U.S. EZ</em> is, surprisingly, almost nothing but. But their pop songs, despite their simplicity, still keep you off balance and snap you out of passive listening, as with the false ending in ""Massive Place"" or the bit of xylophone in the closer ""Quai Des Orfevres"". Some deconstructive impulses remain, like the few choice blasts of static clamoring for space in the languid instrumental ""Bric Jaz"", but these harsher moments are smuggled more inconspicuously into the songs.</p><p>The approachability found here, when mixed with the scruffy recording ethic, makes the songs feel instantly familiar, yet still somehow alien. ""Sing Song Waitress"" is a sweet and longing tune that's nonetheless thrown askew by high-register backing vocals that warble like the sound of children crying through neighboring floorboards. A similar backing is found elsewhere in the two-chord stomp of ""Mater"", which ends with abrupt self-narration from singer/guitarist Mike Donovan. Even the fruity, Beatles-like shuffle of ""Gelly Roll Gum Drop"" sounds just a little left of center somehow.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, <em>U.S. EZ</em> is a far more structured and melodic record, though its few more experimental tracks-- ""Put the Puss to Bed"" or the unexpected pummel and howl of ""N##JJ""-- pale in comparison to the ones that made <em>A Long Way Around to a Shortcut</em> so wonderfully unpredictable. Granted, that was a singles collection, so of course it's more diverse. But here, amidst the nods to a noisier past and the occasional dip into intoxicated broken blues (""Clubbing for $$"", ""CO/CA""), <em>U.S. EZ</em> breaks through with tracks like ""Everywhere, There"", which takes woozy primitive pop and transforms it into something simultaneously fragile and coarse and then, suddenly, sublime.</p></div>"|12263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12263-us-ez/|7.7|Jason Crock

Not that everything the North Carolina band has done has been great, but the potential has always been there. From their auspicious debut <em>The Rosebuds Make Out</em> to its bittersweet follow-up <em>Birds Make Good Neighbors</em> and last year's synth-heavy but hardly frilly <em>Night of the Furies</em>, there have been glimmers of greatness in each of the group's three albums, a rapidly expanding catalog that's established the Rosebuds as Merge's most slept-on act since the shockingly overlooked Spent. <br/><br/>The Rosebuds' husband-and-wife team of Ivan Howard and Kelly Crisp have credited their progress to a learn-as-you-go-along approach, rarely resting lest all that inspiration go to waste. In fact, <em>Life Like</em>, the band's fourth album of original material in five years, reportedly evolved during what was meant to be a break, self-imposed downtime that found the duo doing what they do best: namely, writing more songs, quickly accumulating enough tracks for another album. One advantage of the quick turn around is that as different as the records sometimes are, you can still hear the connections bridging one to the next.</p><p>In the case of <em>Life Like</em> (which is, predictably, good stuff, if not necessarily always the band at its greatest), you can still clearly hear echoes of the minor-key synths that drove <em>Night of the Furies</em>. But you can also hear the group's guitar-driven indie rock roots, as well as the mix of mood and whimsy that made <em>Birds Make Good Neighbors</em> feel so special. Most of all, these tracks sound best in their native contexts: The opening title track could pass for yet more anonymously atmospheric post-punk, at least until it comes on during a late-night drive. Likewise ""Cape Fear"" could be just another indie-dance track, with its pulsing off-beat hi-hats and simple driving bass line, especially in context with <em>Furies</em>, but the mass of instruments and voices buried in the mix makes it hard to peg definitively as either exultant or mournful, even though it touches on both of those disparate emotional tones. <br/><br/>""Border Guards"" is no less mysterious but definitely easier to pin down-- it's as ghostly new wave √° la the Church, albeit nowhere near as portentous (or at least only passively so) thanks to Howard's hushed vocals. It's hard to know where the noirish square-dance of ""Bow to the Middle"" fits into this amorphousness, but it makes self-contained sense nonetheless, just as much as the sentimental paean to road kill ""Nice Fox"" walks a tightrope between literalness and metaphor to capture some existential truth about the ineffable transience of life. The gauzy Church-isms come to the fore again with ""Another Way In"" and ""Concordia Military Club"", before the group reverts to whistle-adorned whimsy with the instrumental ""Hello Darling"", which also includes snippets of a record Howard's grandfather Bobby D. made for his wife during World War II (the record is dedicated to his memory, as well as to Crisp's Grandma Becky). <br/><br/>Following that sweet palate cleanser, the reverb-draped ""Black Hole"" and the deceptively sprightly ""In the Backyard"" (about catching a preacher trying to dig his way to the underworld in the middle of the night) feel like solid if slightly perplexing afterthoughts. The impression is that, were the album tracks all shuffled up and presented in a totally different order, one might easily come away from <em>Life Like</em> with a completely different take or reaction. Indeed, it's an album with its feet on the ground and its head in the clouds, and listening to it is a lot like waiting contentedly in a kind of musical purgatory, happy to be there but still wondering what comes next. It's more of an ellipses pointing you to album number five, but compared to so many other backwards looking records, that's still a pretty great feeling.</p></div>"|12298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12298-life-like/|7.2|Joshua Klein

First, the insistent and decreasingly newsworthy declaration that she is the niece of Athens eccentric Vic Chesnutt, who lent his homespun production and tissue-paper voice to her first two albums. Second, the constant comparison to other Southern female singer-songwriters like Athens' Madeline, Memphis' Megan Reilly, New Orleans' Blair, and the grandmother of them all, Cat Power. Like them, Durrett sings in a dusky voice that does gothic evocation extremely well but doesn't allow for much variety of expression, which has kept her tempos slow and her songs muted.<br/><br/>On her third album, <em>Outside Our Gates</em>, Durrett takes tentative steps toward the spotlight, challenging herself to quit her wallflower ways. If the main criticism of her previous albums was that they sounded pulseless-- all low-key numbers and pretty-but-aloof vocals-- then her new producer Eric Bachmann, from Crooked Fingers and Archers of Loaf, shakes things up a bit, bolstering her dark songs with strings and occasionally a full band to create an airy and unpredictable sound that gently prods Durrett out of her comfort zone. Stand-out ""Wild As Them"" builds on a repeating riff bolstered by a crunchy electric guitar and a counterrhythm courtesy of Chesnutt's blaring omnichord. Eerie, ambient percussion clatters in the background of ""All of Them All"" and ""Always Sign"", the latter sounding like a gussied-up Tom Waits track.<em><br/><br/>Outside Our Gates</em>' titular pronoun is intentional: This is not a loner's record, but a community's collection of songs. Appropriately, the credits read like a who's-who of the Athens scene. Tin Cup Prophette's Amanda Kapousouz lends expressionist strings, while Ham1 and former members of Man or Astro-Man? and Olivia Tremor Control (hey, who isn't a former member of Olivia Tremor Control?) back Durrett, adding spark and texture to these songs. The result is Durrett's liveliest and rangiest record to date, as purposeful as her previous efforts but somehow more surefooted and traipsing.<br/><br/>Which brings us back to Thing Two: Slowly but surely, Durrett is outgrowing all of those comparisons, developing her own particular nuances, mannerisms, and tics. Her vocals define these songs, pushing ""All of Them All"" along its subtle but certain crescendo and corralling all the glowering distortion on ""Not for a Girl"". Uncle Vic harmonizes softly with her on the lush, patient ""We Build Bridges"", their voices blending so naturally and beautifully that she might have asked him to sing regardless of any family connection. She closes with the nearly a cappella ""The Sea a Dream"", on which she layers her vocals into a choir of Lizes. <em>Outside Our Gates</em> may be her most satisfying album to date, but more crucially, despite the crowd of guests, it's definitely the most hers.</p></div>"|12254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12254-outside-our-gates/|7.2|Stephen M.

Before he joined Grizzly Bear in 2004, Daniel Rossen was splicing together samples and bits of unearthed sound with his NYU roommate, Fred Nicolaus; the duo's collages were released, in 2003, as Department of Eagles' eerie, twittering debut, <em>The Cold Nose</em>. That record was followed, in 2006, by a remix album and preceded by a series of vinyl-only singles, under the name Whitey and the Moon UK (also the original title of <em>The Cold Nose</em>). Not long after its release, Rossen partnered with Ed Droste and Grizzly Bear and the Department of Eagles project was put on hiatus-- until late 2007, when the DOE duo, now enlisting contributions from Rossen's Grizzly Bear brethren Chris Bear and Chris Taylor, began recording again. <br/><br/>Unlike Department of Eagles' earlier output, which was heavily focused on sound art and electronic pastiche, <em>In Ear Park</em> is a sprawling pop record (complete with guitars, piano, horns, banjo, and more) that evokes <em>Sgt. Pepper's</em>,<em> Sung Tongs</em>, Van Dyke Parks, and Gene Clark. Like any good sonic experiment,<em> In Ear Park</em> extends with each listen, and things that once sounded small-- the piano bits on ""Teenagers"", the opening fuzz of ""No One Does It Like You"", the noirish echoing footsteps sampled in ""Classical Records""-- become epic on the fourth or fifth spin, as the album swells and expands.<br/><br/><em>In Ear Park</em> is dedicated to Rossen's late father, and while the album is hardly mournful, it is infused with a kind of omnipresent melancholy that occasionally tempers its sunshine (""I laughed so hard I fell down,"" Rossen sings in ""No One Does It Like You"". ""I curse these legs I walked on."") Opener and title track ""In Ear Park"" begins with high, twitchy acoustic guitar, which eventually gives way to an unsteady, paranoid haze; this is Department of Eagles at their freak-folkiest, and it's impossible not to hear the mesmeric whirl of the Incredible String Band (occasionally, Rossen's voice-- wispy and soft-- even sounds a bit like Robin Williamson's). Elsewhere, the band is more straightforward (reinforcing Rossen's claim that some of this material was ""too personal"" for Grizzly Bear)-- the ominous ""Around the Bay"" is a nice slice of gothic-folk, with its acoustic strums, thunderstorm percussion, and sharp, threatening vocals. <br/><br/>Unlike a lot of side projects, Department of Eagles are remarkably self-sufficient-- possibly because Rossen and Nicolaus' partnership predates the current incarnation of Grizzly Bear. The breather between their earlier work and <em>In Ear Park</em> has paid off, helping Rossen and Nicolaus craft a rich, disorienting new direction for Department of Eagles. Ambitious and complex, it's stuffed with cocooning harmonies and shimmering, sunlight-smacking-the-Pacific melodies-- a languid, easy West Coast record (think Randy Newman or <em>SMiLE</em>), infused with classic East Coast anxiety.</p></div>"|12275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12275-in-ear-park/|8.3|Amanda Petrusich

She and three guys formed the Pretenders and released their first album in 1980. Three decades later, <em>The Pretenders</em> stands as one of the best rock debuts ever, and a wellspring of durable songs like ""Brass in Pocket"" and ""Mystery Achievement"". That origin story may explain why Hynde continues to record under the Pretenders shingle instead of under her own name. Most of the band's albums have been glorified solo efforts, with Hynde's grace-and-gravel voice the only constant in a lineup that changes with every release.</p><p>Each new iteration of the Pretenders allows Hynde to tweak her rock sound however slightly, to move in different directions. <em>Break Up the Concrete</em>-- the ninth Pretenders album and the first for Steve Bing's Santa Monica-based indie Shangri-La Music (not to be confused with venerable Memphis indie Shangri-La Records)-- features a new lineup that includes Pernice Brother James Walbourne on guitar, former Son Volt'er Eric Heywood on pedal steel, Pretenders touring bassist Nick Wilkinson on bass, and veteran session musician Jim Keltner on drums (who will be replaced by original drummer Martin Chambers on tour).</p><p>Resituating the Pretenders sound in a roadhouse, the new band infuses Hynde's lefty-righteous rockers with bar-band bravado, adding a rumbling Bo Diddley beat to the title track and a stomping rockabilly recklessness to opener ""Boots of Chinese Plastic"". But they're an agile and restrained crew, adding raw gravitas to barely-hanging-on ballads like ""You Didn't Have To"" and ""The Last Ride"". Aside from some nice country flourishes, it's really the same as it ever was: The tumbling, tight-jointed riffs of ""Rosalee"" recall the punchy rhythms of early hits like ""Tattooed Love Boys"" and ""Cuban Slide"", while ""Don't Lose Faith in Me"" and ""One Thing Never Changed"" possess similarly graceful melodies and tough-minded lyrics as ""Kid"" and ""I'll Stand By You"".</p>
<p>Even so, <em>Break Up the Concrete</em> seems a bit uneven: The faster numbers begin to sound the same after a while, and the album hits a slight lull halfway through. It may be the best Pretenders album since the 1980s, but that isn't really saying much. For all her rock gusto, Hynde isn't prolific. This is only her fifth album since the Pretenders' career-defining comp <em>The Singles</em> in 1987, and <em>Break Up the Concrete</em> handily skirts the studio sheen and reaching-more-than-grasping quality that defines 1994's <em>Last of the Independents</em> and 2002's <em>Loose Screw</em>.</p>
<p>The new lineup's roughed-up sound proves a natural setting for Hynde's signature vocals perfectly and enlivens her performances. At 57, she still sounds as strong as she did 30 years ago, retaining all her brassy defiance and seductive authority. Hynde still knows how to manhandle a rocker and soft-sell a slow number, spitting the seedy lyrics of ""Don't Cut Your Hair"" as deftly as she sings the tender ""Don't Lose Faith in Me"". The title track features her loosest performance, as she dips into the low end of her range and adding some guttural sounds between choruses. That voice demands better material, though. The spiritual lyrics on ""Boots of Chinese Plastic"" don't exactly trip off her tongue, and ""The Nothing Maker"" reaches new depths of meaninglessness: ""He makes nothing,"" she sings on the admiring chorus, ""he's the nothing maker/ He's the maker of nothing."" Sense is obviously one of the many things he doesn't make.</p>
<p>The album hinges on the slower tracks: ""Love's a Mystery"" rides its metaphor into true-crime territory, ""The Last Ride"" is a late-in-life reminiscence worthy of Neil Young's <em>Harvest Moon</em>, and closer ""One Thing Never Changed"" is Hynde at her most vulnerable and wounded. The years haven't touched her pipes, but they have changed her outlook, making her not just feistier but a little more straightforward and forgiving. As a result, <em>Break Up the Concrete</em> sounds simultaneously more agitated and more settled, a contradiction that says a lot about Hynde. True, her best and most exciting material may be long behind her, but three decades into her career, she still has a lot to say and-- despite this album's flaws-- a determinedly distinctive way to say it.</p></div>"|12294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12294-break-up-the-concrete/|6.4|Stephen M.

The resin-sopped riffs of Pepper Keenan's oft-overlooked stoner rock troupe seem to offer the blueprint for much of the opening track on Ancestors' <em>Neptune¬†With Fire</em>. Second, there's the suffocatingly slow inertia of Sleep. The doom progeny's stillness informs the rest of this L.A. five-piece's debut, and Arik Roper, the psych-artist who designed Sleep's¬†<em>Dopesmoker's</em> album art, designed the visuals for <em>Neptune</em>. And then, when you get away from the backbone, there's Pink Floyd and maybe even Hawkwind here as well. But it's those two immediately perceptible reference points that make for an interesting 1990s-informed take on 70s hard psyche, early doom, and art rock.</p><p>The album consists of just two songs-- ""Orcus' Avarice"" is over 16 minutes, the title track is more than 20-- and both serve as launching pads for extended jams. But the soloing is supported by some serious riffs. ""Orcus' Avarice"" evokes CoC, with an urgency that brings to mind ""Heaven's Not Overflowing"" and a pace reminiscent of ""Albatross"". It's the kind of lumbering meganess that easily turns on a dime. So by the time the drums have reeled in, and the guitars ascend into outer-space, it's hard to recall the tumult that came only moments before. Ancestors, able to do more than whip up a simple fervor, spend a good six minutes inspecting the same guitar scale and a slippery blues bassline that gradually builds to climax, like creatine Pink Floyd.</p><p>But the big coup here-- the game-changer, really-- is the presence of an organ. It noodles underneath the ""Orcus"" jam politely, offering texture to an otherwise head-first pound, and recasts the second, title track as a carnival-like bruiser. The wobbly notes swing upward and stall on the final intro chord of ""Neptune With Fire"", as thunder clouds descend and colossal guitars rush in. The second half of the track, with its reliance on monotone Ozzy burring, loses itself momentarily in the sort of weak revivalism that's the order of the day. But the ship rights itself over a crushing ritardando. Steel strings lurch to a crawling halt, the organ throbs, and after a lengthy bass workout, a tremolo-picked guitar sounds in the distance, slowly dragging the riffs back into the fray with post-rock's shit-just-got-real soberness.</p>
<p>Sure, Ancestors' approach can be slightly formulaic. Groundwork is laid with a teeth-rattling riff, decibels drop for a bass exposition and an interstellar jam sesh, which then builds back out into a grinding roar. But it works well, and makes the scant divergences all the more rewarding. Take for instance, the dusty guitar twang that emerges from the midsection of ""Neptune"", where Earth's brutal blues pacing and a tree nymph female vocalist make for a witchy Morricone ambiance. It's the sort of staggering moment that makes it easy to come¬†to <em>Neptune With Fire</em> for the mammoth riffs, but stay for the stretches when Ancestors take ""far out"" even further.</p></div>"|12252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12252-neptune-with-fire/|7.7|Robbie Mackey

Early reviews of the Spinto Band's latest album, <em>Moonwink</em>, have noted with some surprise that it's technically the eighth (or, depending whose count you believe, ninth) full-length from the youthful Delaware sextet. All prior releases, though, appeared on the band's own Spintonic-- at least until their aptly titled 2005 Bar/None debut, <em>Nice and Nicely Done</em>, later reissued overseas by Virgin UK. That makes <em>Moonwink</em> a classic sophomore slump, bursting with melody but overorchestrated and overthought.</p><p>Neurotic, hook-packed songs like ""Trust vs. Mistrust"" and ""Crack the Whip"" made <em>Nice and Nicely Done</em> sound like the Spinto Band could become the Weezer of the new wave revival, splitting the difference between Pavement's <em>Brighten the Corners</em> and <em>Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</em>. The ringing guitars and Arcade Fire-sized arrangement of <em>Nice and Nicely Done</em> highlight ""Oh Mandy"" find a quirkier successor in solid <em>Moonwink</em> single ""Summer Grof"", a handclapping, punning ditty the band describes as ""a vague tribute to the great comedienne Janeane Garofalo."" We don't know who Spinto Band's Mandy was, either, but this song's willful obscurity is typical of an album that's often too clever by half.</p><p>As if to compensate for weaker songs, <em>Moonwink</em> lets the Spinto Band indulge their instinct toward lavishness. ""The Carnival"" has the (dizzying) merry-go-round melodies its title implies, and it's one of the more restrained examples of the album's flightly falsetto harmonies, whoa-oh melismas, and careening strings and horns. Castanet-clicking opener ""Later On"" and synth-led ""Vivian, Don't"" have some whimsical charm, but by the time Spinto Band slow down for ""They All Laughed"", it's as if Humpty Dumpty fell off the Wall of Sound. Singer/guitarist Nick Krill's high, anxious voice starts to grate between the la-las and nice guitar rave-up of ""The Cat's Pajamas"", but it's his quieter colleague, singer/bassist Thomas Hughes, who sounds like he's auditioning to be the model of a modern major general on ""Needlepoint"", one of a few highly theatrical songs here relating to attire.</p>
<p><em>Moonwink</em> wouldn't be so disappointing if <em>Nice and Nicely Done</em> hadn't been unusually promising. The Spinto Band even have a stirring live show. Their latest record has more instruments and lyrical or melodic turns than hooks to hold onto, but its problem is more like an excess of ideas than a lack of them. ""If I don't get your letter then I'll know you're in jail,"" Krill assures on glockenspiel-chimer ""The Black Flag""; it's as overflowing as its neighbors but-- with its ""Revolution""-esque guitar bursts and a chorus that hammers its way into your head-- a hopeful finale. Don't know much about algebra, but I hear the third time's the charm.</p></div>"|12281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12281-moonwink/|5.9|Marc Hogan

I mean, who <em>wouldn't </em>want <em>Pull the Pin </em>to end up being a surprising career renaissance, and not, say, a phenomenally forgettable record so steeped in post-grunge that it's almost impossible to believe it came from Britain, in 2008? I think that score up there can tell you how it turned out.</p><p>In retrospect, it looks like these guys cast their lot with ""Mr. Writer"", a laughably impotent revenge fantasy that projected their own narrow-mindedness on the critics that ""shoot them down."" It set up an us vs. them dichotomy that's allowed the band to retreat to pleasing the diehards and somehow still stick it to scribes: no matter how many times you listen to <em>Pull the Pin</em>, you're still rendered nearly incapable of describing what you just heard. The only variations are laudable only for at least feigning variation-- if Built To Spill's <em>There's Nothing Wrong With Love</em>-ending pisstake was 300% longer and somehow half as sincere, it would be ""Bright Red Star"". ""Daisy Lane"" keeps you up to speed on recent knife violence in England (it's bad), but in doing so, picks at the same threadbare melody line for the song's entirety-- one of the oldest tricks in the Stereophonics book. By the end, you're so sapped for something memorable, that you might be willing to laud the sawtoothed guitar tone that bristles ""I Could Lose Ya"". That's what it comes down to-- an effect featured on literally hundreds of better albums is the star of the show.</p><p>Awful cover art and album title aside, <em>Pull the Pin </em>is rock in the platonic sense, cranking out distorted riffs and power chords while Kelly Jones' vox box stays caked with ashtray residue amidst song structure having the almost mesmerizing predictability of NASCAR. But it's also rock in a different sort of platonic way, as in platonic friend-- no sex, no spark.¬† <em>Pull the Pin </em>might be going for the uncluttered ""production"" of older Rick Rubin, but instead it cops the sterility of newer Rick Rubin, each song lumbering on a chassis of waterlogged tempo and Jones' wooden melodies, begging for just about anything to grab you. Though strings and other electronics were shelved because they're, duh, not rock, <em>Pull the Pin </em>rarely sounds like the result of four guys jamming out in a room.</p>
<p>At least <em>Language. Sex. Violence. Other? </em>had some risible attempts at shoegazer and new wave, along with risibly confrontational lyrics. What you manage to catch here is typically lazy Jones quotes about grim alcohol abuse (the self-explanatory ""Bank Holiday Monday"") and conciliatory women (""I Could Lose Ya""). The former is certainly a charmer-- ""The mind can be a playground if you use it /She could go down on me in a theatre."" And once the dirt-dry blooze of ""Soldiers Make Good Targets"" begins, you half-expect him to start singing about a meatplow instead of his non-starter complaints about war (it's bad). Worse yet, ""It Means Nothing"", which attempts nothing short of being a Lee Greenwood anthem for London's 7/7 bombings, just makes you feel like an asshole for only remembering lines like ""If the bomb goes off again/ And my brain around the train/ And I hope that I'm with you/ 'Cause I wouldn't know what to do"" and ""You can find yourself a god/ Believe in which one you want/ 'Cause they love you all the same/ They just go by different names.""¬† Forget the title of <em>Pull the Pin</em>-- it's been sex, violence, and (mostly) other since <em>J.E.E.P.</em>'s mid-career pit stop into lightheartedness, and at this point, Jones sounds like someone who's just gonna keep crankin' 'em out until he's able to franchise a Hooters.</p></div>"|12255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12255-pull-the-pin/|3.4|Ian Cohen

Among those named: celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, former two-term mayor Ken Livingstone, artist Damien Hirst, actress Judi Dench, playwright Tom Stoppard, and the Streets' Mike Skinner. <br/><br/>It's not surprising to see Skinner in such company, but his inclusion says more about what he's come to mean to Londoners than it does anything about the quality of his current output. Despite the fact that the Streets' cultural relevance has tapered dramatically in the past few years<em></em>, he nonetheless remains emblematic of a character and sub-culture that lifelong Londoners love to see reflected back on themselves. Nobody told the story of drug-hazed, middle-class, post-rave Britain quite so definitively, and for that, he'll probably always be adored. It must feel suffocating sometimes.<br/><br/>In 2008, Skinner is neither drug-hazed nor middle-class. As it happens, he also doesn't seem particularly engaged in any kind of personal struggle. There's nary a whiff of the drug-binging, fame-flaunting, and deeply misanthropic character he put forward on 2006's overrated-by-some (sorry about that) <em>The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living</em>. Instead, he's overcorrected in the other direction: Dig the motivational poster-worthy imagery of the album's campaign (none more flowery than the background image on Skinner's MySpace page, that of footsteps on a sun-dappled beach). And indeed, <em>Everything Is Borrowed</em> finds him in a blissed-out, meditative place: ""Just another brother trying to love my son and mother,"" he raps in ""Way of the Dodo"". ""Providing for my wife is the vibe I'm on in life."" To say this is his most adult record would be a severe understatement; this isn't just Skinner a few years wiser, this is Skinner downright happy. It is also-- not coincidentally-- one the most cringe-inducing and condescending lyrical efforts in recent years.<br/><br/>It doesn't give me any great pleasure to reinforce the rockcrit clich√© that money, fame, and happiness are inhibitors to great work-- especially not when it comes at the damage of someone as likable as Skinner-- but it's hard to dispute in this case. Without any kind of turmoil to deconstruct, friction to rub up against, or confusion to keep him humble, Skinner-- a gifted storyteller, when he has a story to tell-- reverts to a series of metaphysical parables, all of which are delivered with a from-the-mountaintop richness that belies the paper-thin insights on offer. Take, for example, his deconstruction of sin in ""Heaven for the Weather"": ""What is this 'evil', and who decides this?/ When left to devices, some humans try shit/ This is the reason we should all be tied up?/ We're just normal people exploring our minds."" The aforementioned ""Way of the Dodo"", meanwhile, manages to dramatically lower the bar for environmental calls-to-arms by solemnly informing us-- eight times-- that ""it's not earth that's in trouble"" but rather ""the people that live on it."" Worse still is ""Alleged Legends"", a sophomoric takedown of Western religion that's unintentionally hilariously soundtracked by, er, a sitar. ""Some people lead their lives by a little red book,"" Skinner raps. ""The thinking people are thinking that without this book, without these verses, we'd pillage and murder/ But following this red book word for word could lead you to actually pillage and murder/ Could it be so what we think to be right is simply the opinion that survived?"" If you think that's bad, wait for the chorus: ""Do what you think's right and you will feel alright/ Cause when you're bad you will feel sad.""<br/><br/><em>Everything Is Borrowed</em>'s relentless cod-philosophizing and empty moralizing wouldn't be quite so hard to swallow if it were tempered by charm or wit. Unfortunately, there's not much of that on offer; most of Skinner's jokes fall flat, and his one or two observational lyrics [""Never Give In"", ""I Love You More (Than You Like Me)""] pale in comparison to similar material from the past. Only the grateful and celebratory title track and the delicately arranged ""The Strongest Person I Know"" manage to turn up lyrical moments befitting their arrangements.<br/><br/>The most maddening thing about Skinner's lyrical crisis is that it's happened in concert with some of the most sophisticated and satisfying musical moments of his career. While Skinner's sampler has taken a backseat to full band arrangements, and his garage, hip-hop, and ska influences have been replaced, sometimes ill-advisedly, with touches of lounge, rock, disco, and soul, he actually acquits himself well within those new parameters. ""On the Flip of a Coin"" is an unlikely gypsy music/spy theme hybrid that fits together remarkably tidily; ""On the Edge of a Cliff"" is a slick bit of guitar-led soul that wouldn't sound out of place as a Jay-Z single; ""The Strongest Person I Know"" is a harp and oboe-led lullaby with a sweet refrain; and album closer ""The Escapist"", with its swelling horns, rolling percussions and gospel chorus, easily ranks as one of the joyous and most uplifting compositions in his catalogue.<br/><br/>In the end, though, <em>Everything Is Borrowed</em>'s musical high points aren't enough to save it from its lyric sheet, and that, going forward, constitutes a real problem for Skinner. Given that he's threatened repeatedly to retire the Streets after five full-length albums, it might be an issue he's already well aware of. Either way, something's got to give; another record of similarly hollow platitudes might be enough to undo his legacy.</p></div>"|12291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12291-everything-is-borrowed/|4.8|Mark Pytlik

For some, it's a masterpiece so resounding in its effect as to make the rest of ""jazz"" extraneous (or at least reasonably deferred until some later point when older or more patient). For others, it's a hallmark whose masterpiece status no amount of further exploration could impugn. Either way, everybody likes it. As Q-Tip says on a documentary included with this new 2xCD/DVD 50th-anniversary set, ""It's like the Bible-- you just have one in your house."" <br/><br/>All of that might make <em>Kind of Blue</em> sound kind of boring, and indeed, part of the album's allure owes to the fact that it is among the least immediately radical paradigm-shifters you're ever likely to hear. As another bit on the DVD tells it, this one from the host of the 1950s TV show ""The Robert Herridge Theater"", a serious guy in black-and-white, smoking: ""There are many ways to tell a story, and what you're listening to now-- the music of Miles Davis-- is one of the ways."" <br/><br/>Such matter-of-fact understatement suits <em>Kind of Blue</em>, an album that sounds like it's never been in a good mood it didn't consider fleeting or a bad one it couldn't brood its way out of. When Davis and his band commenced recording in 1959, they settled on a new form of ""modal"" jazz that called for improvising through scales as opposed to preordained chord changes. And even if that doesn't sound apparent to an untrained musical ear, it's suggested by a spectral sense of wandering-- an ease with uncertainty that comes across in no uncertain terms. <br/><br/><em>Kind of Blue</em>'s rewards get doled out patiently and persistently, from the cool walk of ""So What"" to the magisterial glide of ""Flamenco Sketches"". The tracks that fall between-- ""Freddie Freeloader"", ""Blue in Green"", and ""All Blues""-- cover pretty much everything else. The story of them all is told to good effect in <em>Celebrating a Masterpiece: Kind of Blue</em>, a 55-minute documentary that anchors this new anniversary package-- which also includes a 60-page book and the album on blue vinyl. Nobody with a curious ear has hurt for <em>Kind of Blue</em>-related resources over the years, especially since a remaster in 1997 rescued the sound of it in fantastic fashion. The CD sounds the same in this new package, which pairs <em>Kind of Blue</em> on a disc with an already-released alternate take of ""Flamenco Sketches"" and nine short false-starts and studio bits, none longer than two minutes. Disc 2 cobbles together six earlier recordings by the players responsible for <em>Kind of Blue</em>: Davis, Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. The standout is a 17-minute live recording of ""So What"" played much faster, tighter, and harder than simmering version that went on the finished album. <br/><br/>The DVD features the full 26-minute ""Robert Herridge Theater"" show supplementing the documentary, which does an admirable job of taking the album itself as its subject. Some of the drama that surrounded the making of it enters in, but for the most part, the film focuses on how the album works and why. Much of it owes to the whole of the band. But then there's Davis-- an inimitable presence who drummer Cobb, still a bit wowed this many years later, describes as sounding ""like he was sitting on an iceberg somewhere out in the South Pole, alone."" <br/><br/>As an album, <em>Kind of Blue</em> is unimpeachable, the kind of record you look forward to listening to decades down the line. As a reissue, this anniversary package (expensive at $109.98) is nice but less than essential, best for completists or those with good record players to put the new vinyl pressing to good use.</p></div>"|12283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12283-kind-of-blue-50th-anniversary-edition/|6.6|Andy Battaglia

The template he created for himself as solo electro maniac Hawnay Troof has come close to sounding like a one-trick pony at times, but that is set to change with the release of his third album, <em>Islands of Ayle</em>, which was largely assembled during a 20-month world tour and features samples recorded everywhere from the Swiss Alps to Beijing. Here we can hear Cooler breaking his own mold with a fully realized album that fuses his hot-headed and fun approach to music making with some surprisingly great experimentation.<br/><br/>The most enjoyable aspect of <em>Islands of Ayle</em> is Cooler's bold employment of traditional hip-hop rhythmic structures, which dishevel his more standard electro-punk patterns and allow the arrangements on this album to be completely thrilling-- this is the sound of a young musician who is not afraid to fuck with anything, or try something new, and this attitude leaves every track with an aftertaste as bright and strong as neon. The result is undoubtedly erratic, as Cooler intersperses classic common meter MCing in the style of Run-D.M.C. and Beastie Boys with unexpected breaks and fierce synth patches that burst out all over the place like the startling unpredictability of fireworks. (In fact, this record borrows so much from <em>Hello Nasty</em> that if Cooler wasn't so exploratory and light-hearted in his approach it would verge on ridiculous; even Jenny Hoyston sounds like Mike D in her guest appearance on ""Out of Teen Revisited"".)</p><p>Unlike his contemporaries, such as Pittsburgh duo Grand Buffet and fellow west coaster Gold Chains, Cooler doesn't focus on creating anthemic melodies. His hooks are like hot potatoes: just when you get into it, he sweeps the beat to leave you hanging. The closest he comes to sticking to his guns is ""Underneath the Ocean"", which features lovely vocals from High Places' Mary Pearson. Elsewhere, tracks like the recent single ""Connection"" match bratty cat calling with intricately layered programming, and ""Bizarre Triangle"" sizzles with lyrical wildness, finishing up with a dirty edged skit that could either be about sex or cake baking (Cooler actually released his first cookbook, ""The Hungry Truth"", in 2005).<br/><br/>Of course, underneath the silver hip-hop lining and flirtations with Kanye West style vocal samples fused with the type of dance euphoria that would make the Chemical Brothers proud (such as ""Venus Venus Piper""), Cooler is a punk rock kid still firmly rooted to the west coast DIY scene that he has been a part of since moving from Alabama in 1998. This celebration of community is imprinted all over <em>Islands of Ayle</em>: Cooler drafted a slew of pals, including Randy Randall (No Age), Jamie Stewart (Xiu Xiu), and Carla Bozulich, to contribute to the album proper, while a limited-edition CD offers a selection of remixes from Lucky Dragons, Mae Shi, and Soft Pink Truth.<br/><br/>When Cooler sings ""If you've got your walk down, I hope you fully walk"" on ""Connection"" one can't help feeling that he has taken his own advice. In just over 30 minutes, he leaves an impression of a confidence that has moved beyond the ego and into a territory that enables him to get away with just about anything.</p></div>"|12253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12253-islands-of-ayle/|7.5|Mia Clarke

The band is often compared to Neurosis and Isis, who also cultivate inscrutability. Yet concrete concerns emerge from Neurosis (the elements) and Isis (water, surveillance). Intronaut, on the other hand, are almost opaque. That's not just because of their lyrics, which are willfully abstract, and which were omitted altogether from the liner notes of <em>Prehistoricisms</em>. With a sound that's only moderately aggressive, the band doesn't reduce to ""victory,"" ""apocalypse,"" ""rebellion,"" ""catharsis,"" or other traditional metal themes. Intronaut's appeal is, for the most part, instrumental. <br/>¬†<br/>Virtuosity is aplenty in metal, but few metal bands have jazz fusion chops. The cultures don't align; metal is usually rigid, while fusion privileges improvisation. A few precedents exist for Intronaut's metal/fusion hybrid, like Cynic and Coprofago. But none have integrated these elements as organically as Intronaut, and with such restraint. Solos are rare; Joe Lester's bass is the most mobile instrument, while the guitarists mainly stick with chords and textures. Drummer Danny Walker is astoundingly dexterous, with agile fills, incisive cymbals, and power to spare. (He also moonlights in grindcore band Phobia.) On top are Sacha Dunable's yells, whose patterns resemble Neurosis', but are less expressive. <br/>¬†<br/>New guitarist Dave Timnick, who played as a drummer with Lester in non-metal projects, adds flexibility to an already limber lineup. (His predecessor Leon del Muerte was more grindcore-oriented.)¬† These are Intronaut's most adventurous songs to date. ""Prehistoricisms"" pits sheets of noise against playful bass pokings, then slams into searingly emotional chords. ""The Literal Black Cloud"" stretches one of Intronaut's fortes, a foot-dragging lurch that evokes spinning wheels in mud, into a delightful tapestry of counterpoint. ""Any Port"" is magnificently anthemic, closing with a thrilling tribal percussion jam. ""The Reptilian Brain"" opens with traditional Indian noodlings, complete with tabla (Lester is trained in Indian music), then drops into a shifting landscape of prog odd meters, pensive fusion, and trenchant metal. These departures place the metal sections in sharper relief; Intronaut have possibly the greatest command of dynamics of any metal band. <br/>¬†<br/>Unfortunately, the recording doesn't capture that. It's technically perfect; the instruments are clearly defined, with good separation between them. But the production is better suited for power metal. The drums are over-compressed, turning Walker's crisp work into thuds. As a result, the record feels flat, lacking peaks and valleys. Such production is typical in metal today, and it's not fatal in an age of iPod headphones and dubious MP3 bitrates. But to hear these songs as they should be heard, see Intronaut live. It's a deep, mysterious, and often moving experience.</p></div>"|12258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12258-prehistoricisms/|7.0|Cosmo Lee

Movies, I mean. Six months go by between trips to the multiplex. If Netflix still turns a profit after recent financial events, it'll be because of two DVDs my wife and I have been meaning to send back (unseen) since, ohh, August. So in other words, those early Wes Anderson flicks are still pretty huge for me, even as a divided pop culture has helped big-budget schlock conquer actual film snobs. Anderson and many effective fey indie-poppers have real similarities: obsessive detail, pitch-perfect verbiage, outlandish characters, bookish humor, <em>Harold and Maude</em>-retro aesthetic, supersized cult followings. No surprise, then that Noah and the Whale take their name from director Noah Baumbach and his Anderson-produced <em>The Squid and the Whale</em>.</p><p><em>Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down</em>, the debut LP by the London folk-pop quartet, bites its best sensitive-indie forebears and then pukes up all the most superficial chunks.

You've got your quirky, mostly sprightly arrangements: acoustic guitar, ukulele, banjo, glockenspiel, handclaps, fingersnaps, strings, horns, eccentric percussion... the full Sufjan Stevens.

But still we press on, only to hear the similarly twee-by-numbers ""Jocasta"" fill spaces with the word ""oh"" the way us inarticulate Gen-Yers tend to say ""like"" or ""you know."" Timpani-rumbling ""Do What You Do"" and piano-backed ""Give a Little Love"" offer practical advice, generally of the ""Do what you do"" or ""All is fleeting/ Yeah, but all is good"" sort. By the time the whistling starts over ""Brimful of Asha"" chords on highest-charting single ""5 Years Time"" (""Sun, sun, sun!"" ""Fun, fun, fun!"" ""Love, love, love!""), smoking ""stupid little cigarettes"" and drinking a few boxes of ""stupid wine""-- oh, respite and nepenthe!-- sounds like the second-best activity to stupid little murder-suicide.

Vivian Girls, an all-female trio who've become overnight sensations among critics and underground rock fans, are seemingly candidates for one of those emperor's new clothes-type reveals-- after all, they hail from said borough and perform lo-fi garage rock that taps a number of fashionable historical, ideological, and aesthetic wellsprings (C86! Slumberland! Olympia! Nuggets! Spector!). They deflect the knee-jerk criticism the most effective way possible, though: with an armful of kick-ass songs.</p><p>Vivian Girls' 22-minute debut for the California-based garage-rock imprint In the Red is actually a reissue of this spring's 500-copy run on the tiny Mauled by Tigers label. The original release sold out in 10 days, amping both the band's mystique and the record's exchange value: A vinyl copy ended bidding at $68 on eBay a couple weeks ago. So far, Vivian Girls seem to be taking their subcultural celebrity-- not to mention the summer departure of drummer and band founder Frankie Rose for brother band Crystal Stilts-- in stride. In the <a href=""http://pitchfork.tv/videos/vivian-girls-tell-the-world"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>intentionally dorky video</strong></a> for ""Tell the World"", Cassie Ramone, Kickball Katy, and Ali Koehler address the camera, poised and unsmiling, even as they pantomime the usual humiliating music vid motions.¬†</p><p>The band's lyrics are just as purposefully passive. In his intro to Rhino's superlative box set, <em>One Kiss Can Lead to Another: Girl Group Sounds Lost and Found</em>, critic Gene Sculatti locates the enduring popularity of 60s girl group music in its effect: ""This music was, like a moving symphony or free-floating jazz jam, mainly about a feel, a sound. It had words, yes, but they were never intended to get in the way of the overall impact of the record."" Punk credentials aside, Vivian Girls are clearly simpatico to that gentler era's agenda. According to the band, the album is somewhat conceptual, its 10 tracks evenly split between love and heartbreak. ""No"", an angry thrash-and-bash propelled by a single lyric (guess!) is easy to place. But the LP is rarely so transparent, and Vivian Girls mainly get their message across with a murky wall of noise. Try to pry the lyrics of cacophonous openers ""All the Time"" and ‚ÄúSuch a Joke"" from their shoegazery feedback, thudding bass, and tambourine rattle and you'll be missing the point.</p>
<p>Without risking pastiche, the band gets plenty of mileage from its sonic references. ""Tell the World""s frantic beat recalls the jittery, chaotic rhythm of Black Tambourine's ""Throw Aggi Off the Bridge"", while the Girls' flawless, calmly executed three-part harmony counters with the satin-shoed professionalism of the Crystals. The lyrics-- this is one of Vivian Girls' few completely legible songs-- are as ambivalent: ""I'll tell the world about the love that I've found,"" they enthuse, giving public voice to teenage infatuation (an evergreen girl-group subject), while at the same time raising the Spector of out-of-whack control issues: ""He sees what I see/ He feels what I feel."" (Not convinced? Switch out the gender of the pronoun and singers.) The end result is phenomenal, one of 2008's best songs. The sweet jangled ""Where Do You Run To"" is almost as great, making pining at home seem not so bad, all things considered.<br><br>The trio nabbed its name from the heroines of outsider artist Henry Darger's magnum opus, <em>In the Realms of the Unreal</em>. A sorority of vaguely fetishized hermaphrodite messiahs, Darger's Vivian girls are some of the most slippery, troublesome figures in contemporary art, making the band's appropriation a clever bit of self-mythologizing. The final track on their album, ""I Believe in Nothing"", purportedly endorses nihilism. But it puts the lie to its own message with heavenly madrigals and a hooky refrain that'll burrow into your brain and replay like a mantra until you do, in fact, believe in something. Even if it's just this really awesome new band.</br></br></p></div>"|12286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12286-vivian-girls/|8.5|Amy Granzin

But for fraternal Field Music leaders David and Peter Brewis, the end of the band does not mean the death of the brand. Citing a growing disillusion with the touring and promotional aspects of being in a band but a continued enthusiasm for the recording/creative process, the brothers have essentially split into two outfits united under the ""Field Music Productions"" banner: David was first past the post earlier this year with his boisterous new School of Language project, which closely adhered to its antecedent's post-punky guitar pop schematic, while Peter now emerges with the even more ambitious The Week That Was, whose assured self-titled debut ushers in the Brewis brothers' next phase in earnest. <br/><br/>Perhaps Field Music's most impressive quality was how they pulled off complex, multi-instrumental arrangements in a three-piece format; The Week That Was makes those grandiose intimations real with a formidable nine-piece line-up (including David in a supporting bassist role). Opener ""Learn to Learn"" begins with a booming repeated bass-drum/floor-tom pattern that acknowledges the lingering influence of XTC (cf., ""Making Plans for Nigel""), but also serves as a telling harbinger of Peter's renewed aesthetic, in which traditional new-wave guitars and synths are de-emphasized to exploit the acoustic and percussive qualities of pianos, vibraphones, marimbas, cornets, violins, and, yes, cowbells. It‚Äôs an approach that was prefigured by <em>Tones of Town</em> tracks like ""A House Is Not a Home"", but given a more authoritative treatment here: the tick-tock clatter of ""The Good Life"" and the hypnotic, Congotronic vibraphone oscillations of the gorgeous ""It's All Gone Quiet"" prove to be perfect complements to their workaday narratives, while the stuttering, trip-you-up drum beat of ""The Airport Line"" makes the journey to its swooning chorus that much more rewarding. When the strings come in to soothe the staccato rhythm, the net effect is something like Big Star's <em>Third/Sister Lovers</em> as performed by Can. <br/><br/>Despite the more elaborate presentation,<em> The Week That Was</em> sticks to the Field Music tradition of packing a surfeit of ideas into a compact package, in this case eight songs and 32 minutes; even the inclusion of a seven-minute prog-like suite, ""Yesterday's Paper"", doesn't curb momentum, those omnipresent drum rolls propelling the song through its multi-sectional turns at a brisk clip. Peter‚Äôs songwriting sensibility places him squarely in a post-psych/post-punk tradition that's equal parts Colin Newman and Carl Newman, Robert Wyatt, and Robert Pollard, but the constant tension between The Week That Was' percussive and melodic elements means that, unlike Field Music, his new band can‚Äôt be so easily aligned with contemporary indie-rock acts peddling new-wave nostalgia. Never mind the retro-gazing moniker-- The Week That Was is a band you need to hear now.</p></div>"|12244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12244-the-week-that-was/|8.2|Stuart Berman
