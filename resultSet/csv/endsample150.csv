One of the label’s earliest and most beloved releases was <i>The Cold Vein</i>, the debut LP from Cannibal Ox, a duo made up of two Harlem rappers with names like Transformers characters (Vast Aire and Vordul Mega). The group’s sound was vaguely familiar, with clear roots in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"">Wu-Tang</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravediggaz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gravediggaz</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2324-kool-keith/"">Kool Keith</a>, but it was distinguished by moments of sharp surrealism, linguistic deconstructions, and a deep underlying sadness. Def Jux co-founder and producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"">El-P</a>’s beats enhanced the unfamiliarity of the landscape, traversing a no-man’s-land between the dusty swing of boom-bap and glitchy electronica.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In the decade and a half since the release of <i>The Cold Vein</i>, Cannibal Ox have released only a few songs together. They fell out with El-P, cut their ties at Def Jux, and mostly receded from view. Following a string of one-off reunions on Vast’s solo albums, the two rappers have been crying wolf about a new full-length for the last few years. It’s arrived, by way of their own Iron Galaxy Records, in the form of the sprawling 19-track collection <i>Blade of the Ronin</i>. In some ways, the album resembles its predecessor. Both are distinctly overwhelming sets of songs—collections of dense verses strung between equally verbose refrains—backed by hazy samples, damaged synth insulation and chunky breakbeats. But <i>Ronin</i> feels ponderous and self-conscious in a way that is at odds with the unfettered creative spirit of their first effort.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though this album, too, is full of offbeat and athletic bars—clearly, the work of the same guys—the familiar soothsayer mysticism often feels like it’s been laid on too thick, or just misplaced. After all, Ox’s most far-flung moments on <i>The Cold Vein</i> got their mileage from meaningful framing, with often-heartbreaking autobiographical imagery serving as the catapult into the rappers’ pan-religious parables and comic book fan fiction. Just as Bastian imagines <i>The Neverending Story</i> while reading alone and hiding from bullies, the young versions of Vast and Mega dream up alternate realities after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXWnKBkb70U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""stealing Marvel comics and water uzis""</a> and decamping from the action on their block. But on <i>Ronin</i>, we’re usually trapped in their diorama, getting only a few glimpses of its inspiration.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The handful of powerful connections to the outside world are made mostly by Vordul Mega, the group’s more reticent half. On ""Harlem Knights"", for instance, Mega spends one of the album’s economically sketched verses describing concrete images of a misspent, grief-punctuated childhood. He steals the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11216-black-milk/"">Black Milk</a>-produced ""Gotham (Ox City)"" with his opening couplet—""We stay in shape like Porsches on blocks/ Where women is gorgeous and kids stay strapped like Bugs Bunny Jordans""—before the song detours toward less inspiring talk of ""New York Gritty"" and Clayface.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It seems strange that Can Ox’s new work would run dry on the white-knuckled realism which was once so important to them, but the shortage becomes clear after dozens of verses padded out with half-cogent, free-associative rambling and clunky insult humor. Vast Aire’s contributions are often fun and always inimitable—it would be hard to imagine almost any other rapper selling ""You will never see the vipers when they come out the sand/ You will never see the cobra head, as it expands"" before ""I change my skin like Zartan"". However, his lines of thinking quickly veer in cringeworthy (""These girls is like Frankenstein/ They got fake hair, fake nails and monster behinds""), superfluous (""You gotta say my name backwards like Mxyzptlk/ Hold up, did I mention/ I like to fight imps from the fifth dimension"") or lazy directions (""My kids are rough, they eat iron candy/ My girl's tough, she wears iron panties/ I was born in an iron galaxy"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album is also impeded by its uniform, relentlessly bleak production. Producer Bill Cosmiq paints his synth pads and samples on thick, creating muffled washes of midrange sound. The snares thud rather than pop, ringing out as if from a bunker to which everyone in New York has flocked to prepare for the end of days. There are moments of resourceful coloration and melody: see, for instance, the high, mournful vocal sample on ""The Power Cosmiq"" or the tack piano melody and orchestral flourishes on ""Salvation"". But whereas El’s beats on <i>The Cold Vein</i> were aberrant in their very syntax—full of disconcerting rhythmic faultlines, eerie melodic hooks and a sense of space—the curiosities  in Cosmiq’s work feel tacked on and vestigial.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s no doubt that <i>Blade of the Ronin</i> is the work of two very particular and oversized personalities, but the album does not feel like either a blast of fresh air or a return to form after wayward solo careers. Where <i>The Cold Vein</i> felt like an alien object dropped to Earth, <i>Ronin</i> arrives in 2015 sounding a bit commonplace. That’s not totally Can Ox’s fault: By now, indie rap of this sort has become a recognizable subgenre in the wake of so many <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"">DOOM</a> alteregos, <a href=""https://www.anticon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anticon</a> releases and a continuing stream of Internet-celebrated underground rappers with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15864-lost-in-translation/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">absurd</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17884-the-patriarch/"">psychedelic</a> tendencies. But unfortunately Vast and Mega’s work here does not serve to remind us of the superiority of the genuine article, or work to resensitize us. Like a new <i>Paranormal Activity</i> movie, a greasy-spoon diner cheeseburger or the last Warhol screen print at the museum, it will be worth its weight for hardcore fans who appreciate alterations to a template. But even those who decided years ago that this album was going to be great will be hard-pressed to find a great rap record here, only a sporadically enjoyable one.</p></div>"|20327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20327-blade-of-the-ronin/|6.7|Winston Cook-Wilson

Inspired by the images of athletes posted around his apartment, singer Ben Cook rolls out of bed, throws on some sweats, and hits the streets. His heart’s not in it, though: He attempts some pull ups and listlessly swipes at a punching bag, but mostly he putters around the city, kicking snow, smoking cigarettes, and staring at nothing in particular.<br/>  <br/> That same noncommittal attitude has carried through Cook’s many bands outside of his primary gig playing guitar for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"">Fucked Up</a>. He’s bounced from one flash collaboration or side project to another—among them <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28587-the-marvelous-darlings/"">Marvelous Darlings</a>, the Bitters, Roommates, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30700-yacht-club/"">Yacht Club</a>—leaving a trail of demo tapes and 7-inches but never devoting himself to any act for the long haul. Some of those bands flamed out before they could realize their potential, others were probably never intended to have much of a shelf life, but each inched Cook ever so slightly away from messy punk and toward the tuneful comforts of power-pop, the jumping-off point for his full-length debut as Young Guv, <i>Ripe 4 Luv</i>. Tying some of the loose ends from his previous projects, though never too neatly, it’s Cook’s cleanest, most easygoing release yet, and far and away his catchiest.<br/> <br/> Like every album released by <a href=""http://www.slumberlandrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slumberland Records</a> since its 2006 resurrection, <i>Ripe 4 Luv</i> is versed in the shimmery indie-pop of the label’s heyday years. But Cook is too restless to limit himself to any single musical tradition, so <i>Ripe 4 Luv</i> also detours into soft-rock slow jams, giddy new wave, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>’s hormonal R&amp;B-pop. The title track is straight out of <i>Dirty Mind</i>, all bubblegum guitar and funk strut, while ""Aquarian"" sets its 10cc-style pillow talk against a mechanically cool, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"">Sade</a>-esque groove.<br/> <br/> Cook has the songwriting chops to pull off all these styles. He’s ghostwritten for such unlikely big names as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"">Taylor Swift</a>, Kelly Clarkson, and Maroon 5, so he’s never been as bound by punk orthodoxy as his years in the Canadian hardcore scene suggested. And unlike many indie acts that have moonlighted with soft rock and R&amp;B over the last half decade—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"">Blood Orang</a>e on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18736-blood-orange-cupid-deluxe/""><i>Cupid Deluxe</i></a>; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"">Destroyer</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/""><i>Kaputt</i></a>; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"">Gayngs</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14188-relayted/""><i>Relayted</i></a>—Cook isn’t too concerned with nailing the nuances of these genres. Instead, he captures the general feel, mines it for a quick hook, then moves on. He’s just not the type of musician who’s going to dedicate the effort required for a sustained, elaborate genre homage, especially when the gist will suffice. <br/> <br/> <i>Ripe 4 Luv</i> is relentlessly sunny throughout its 33-minute run, though Cook can’t resist letting a little skeeziness in here and there. Behind its ringing guitars and Alex Chilton harmonies, ""Kelly, I’m Not a Creep"" disguises an unnerving portrait of an inter-apartment building stalker. The seven-minute closer ""Wrong Crowd"", meanwhile, stretches Young Guv’s throwback soft rock to the point of sleazy parody. The joke grows stale even before some Showtime After Dark saxophone arrives to close out the song. It’s the album’s only bum track, but thankfully it’s tucked at the end, and it doesn’t sour what came before it. Throughout <i>Ripe 4 Luv</i> you can sense that it’s taking every ounce of discipline Cook has to play these pop songs as straight as he does, so he can be forgiven for indulging a little kitsch at the finish line.</p></div>"|20241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20241-ripe-4-luv/|7.5|Evan Rytlewski

As someone who sounds more at ease testing his ideas than sticking with and building off a formula, he hasn't had the chance to define himself with a signature style.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Not that he hasn't had some highlights: 2003's </span><i>Ascension </i><span>and its glitched-up d'n'b, the sun-drenched prog-dubstep of '09 single ""Hypercolor"", and his oddly idyllic take on electro-house on 2012's </span><i>Language </i><span>made a career of constant digressions worth following. He may have tripped over his own ambitions a couple times, but at least something like 2010's </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14680-eskmo/""><span>self-titled exercise</span></a><span> in jumbled bass pile-ups couldn't be called complacent<span>—</span>or definitive, for that matter. With his more recent work paring back the gloss and bloat of big-statement </span><span>Eskmo</span><span>, a turn to more open-spaced, modern-classical influenced compositions feels like a solid decision.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Angelides' ear for nuanced ambience comes to the forefront on <i>SOL</i>, an album inspired by the sun and his work with the Los Angeles composer collective Echo Society. Slow builds and minimal beats emerge into warm presences, even if the droning compositions do more to insinuate moods than induce them. Spending enough time with the opening one-two of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>-interlude-style ""SpVce"" and the slow-motion monolith of ""Combustion"" will do a lot to distract from the actual dearth of kicks and snares on this record. The midpoint peak, an eleven-minute stretch incorporating the tracks ""Sol"" and ""The Light of One Thousand Furnaces"", lets the drones and bass thrums sink in until they sound like chamber strings, building to the one big moment of intense, cathartic percussion on the record.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>SOL </i>has less gravity when it steers away from its majestic solar themes and tries to put its abstract sensations into words. Eskmo's vocals, while delicate, still feel intrusive. The mannered, show-offy crooning about ""morning mist and firefly dust"" over ""Blue and Grey"" and the vague, Mattel-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a> cheapness of  ""Mind of War"" break the mood, putting the focus more on an (not especially engaging) individual voice than the feeling of bigger-than-all-of-us cosmic heat the record's best moments invoke. At least it's just one of dozens of voices he's worked with over the years<span>—</span>he'll find plenty more before it's all said and done.</p></div>"|20332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20332-sol/|6.4|Nate Patrin

It comes in the usual forms—oceans, river, rain—and the ones we don't consider as often, like tears and spit and nicks of blood. Jones, known for her work at the front of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31635-all-dogs/"" target=""_blank"">All Dogs</a> and with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31770-saintseneca/"" target=""_blank"">Saintseneca</a>, uses <i>The Offer</i> to hunt down form inside a looming infinity. She hungers for the human shapes that break up the drones of time, space, and sea.</p>
<p><span>Jones' dark guitar and gently creased voice form most of the album on their own, but her songs don't feel restricted to a single person. They spill out of themselves, flow into each other, and cohere into a whole, like circuits in a system. When synthesizers or drums or extra voices seep in, they show up as naturally as weather. Jones might be alone, but there are no seams between her and her atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a song called ""Yowler"" on <i>The Offer</i>, a name that resists convention—you don't name your project after a song or vice versa unless you're trying to make a point. Here, it fits; on the chorus, Jones sings, ""Your hands look just like mine."" She's looking across at another human body, amazed at the mirror image she finds, disturbed by the strange kinship. Hands are dense, complex machines, and yet you can hold your own up to someone else's, and most of the time, they'll match. On Soundcloud, the track appears as ""Yowler :: Yowler"". The mirror is there before you hear the song.</span></p>
<p><span>Jones reveals a love of language just in the way she bends it. She chooses and pronounces her words carefully. She'll invert cliches: ""You can lead me to the water but you cannot make me drink,"" she sings on ""Yowler"". A chorus of low voices swarms her, like a mob about to dunk her in the river, or a hand guiding her away from the bank. ""You will not be avoided/ 'Cause your ghost is haunting me."" </span></p>
<p><span>She sings about drowning on ""Holidays"", only she calls it gestating. She imagines her body floating beneath a sheet of ice, and she uses a word intended to describe new life. Is there hope in that image, in the idea that dissolving into death is its own kind of birth? ""If I return my body to the running black dark... will it be me? Will I see me?"" Jones wonders. Does the person break apart when the body does, or is there a different shape you can't see?</span></p>
<p><span>""I am nothing/ I am but a shape,"" Jones sings on ""Water"". Those two lines seem to contradict each other, and she spends <i>The Offer</i> negotiating the tension between them. The album is a deep, sad comfort, more complex than it first appears, like a pond frozen over and still writhing with life.</span></p></div>"|20202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20202-the-offer/|8.0|Sasha Geffen

Of course, there are <i>better</i> methods for listening to certain music. You’d hate to experience the majesty of Wagner’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ring Cycle</i></a>, for instance, by playing scuffed records on a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Crosley-CR8005A-TU-Portable-Turntable-Turquoise/dp/B00990Z4W6"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crosley Cruiser turntable</a>, and it would be a waste to dump a fortune into an ostentatious hi-fi system if all you really want to do is blast Mayhem’s <i>De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</i>. But most music and music players fall somewhere in between, so that the differences we experience<b> </b>are rather incremental. Maybe a good record sounds great with a certain setup, but it should still have some payoff even through a pair of tiny white earbuds.</p>
<p><i>Mysteries</i>—the third album by the elusive, prolific Portuguese one-man black metal band Black Cilice—highlights the question of how best to hear by suggesting that there are at least two distinct and acceptable answers. Given the subgenre, you might think that it would be best to simply turn it up, and let it roar. And, yes, at high volumes, where the guitars can shriek and the agitated drums can pound, <i>Mysteries </i>is a monster.</p>
<p>But you can also turn <i>Mysteries</i> way<i> </i>down, until those barreling drums recede into a heavy patter and the guitars blur into the record’s presiding distortion and feedback. It becomes a patterned sheet of sound then, where bits and pieces protrude from a singular din. Because they were so poorly recorded, early black metal records sometimes sounded like drone music: The instruments overwhelmed the devices meant to capture them. But Black Cilice take that aesthetic a step further, deploying the technique selectively so that strident guitars, bruised drums and yowled vocals move under and above that matrix, as if they’re alternating between floating and drowning.</p>
<p>Black Cilice don’t reinvent quarter-century-old black metal structures; they just lash at them, playing hard, fast, loud and mean. ""Ceremonial Energy"" bursts forward, a rising-and-falling blast beat and back-and-forth riff suggesting vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"">Darkthrone</a>. ""Into Morbid Trance"" bounds between primitive thrash and menacing black metal, where every instrument seems to be attempting to force its counterparts out of the picture. The vocals suggest gale-force winds passing though a room of live microphones and amplifiers, creating feedback only to harmonize with it.</p>
<p>There’s finesse to this mess, as though Black Cilice were trying to tease the border between heavy metal and experimental music. Turned up, for instance, ""The Truth"" is a pugnacious stomp-along; turned down, it feels strangely warm and beautiful. It suggests Rhys Chatham’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0WaNVgJqCU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">music for massed guitars</a>, where so many instruments were played at once that it became impossible to tell where one ended and another began, or a reprise of Alvin Lucier’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>I Am Sitting in a Room</i></a>, where the first-person subject is actually a roughshod recording of a black metal band.</p>
<p>This conceit may seem ridiculous, both for the suggestion that you should lower the volume on a black metal record in order to enjoy it more and for the implication that Black Cilice is some avant-garde wizard with grander intentions than badly recorded bedlam. But to date, each Black Cilice record has gotten more controlled and nuanced; the metal tantrums beneath the noise are more complicated and compelling, and the hiss and squall above it all are more engrossing and interesting. There is an arc of progress to trace in Black Cilice’s output, suggesting that the diametric results of putting <i>Mysteries</i> in the background or foreground are more than mere coincidence.</p>
<p>The cover of each Black Cilice full-length has been all black, save for a centered, shrouded figure wearing corpsepaint and doing something wicked. On 2011’s <i>A Corpse, A Temple</i>, <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/images/3/2/3/7/323785.jpg?1841"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he reached skyward,</a> holding a volume bearing an inverted crucifix. On <i>Mysteries</i>, <a href=""http://echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Black-Cilice-wpcf_262x300.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he grimaces as he again looks upward and touches his stomach. </a>For the last three months, I’ve tried to figure out if he’s clutching a rosary to his chest or if he’s pressing against a gushing abdomen wound. The high-contrast image makes it impossible to tell, at least to me and everyone I’ve asked. However willful or accidental, such ambiguity epitomizes the aesthetic of Black Cilice, a strange transmission responsible for one of the most intriguing intersections of black metal and sound art I’ve ever heard.</p></div>"|20267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20267-mysteries/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

<p dir=""ltr"">White’s first album under his own name, 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16963-big-inner/"">Big Inner</a></i>, contemplated Big Ideas — love, death, God — in an opulent setting of analog-era soul and down-home psychedelia, brimming with horns and strings. Recent Spacebomb projects, including the radiant 2015 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20088-natalie-prass/"">self-titled debut</a> of former Jenny Lewis backing singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32614-natalie-prass/"">Natalie Prass</a>, have followed suit. <i>Fresh Blood</i>, White's sophomore album, mostly stays true to the house style, improving on <i>Big Inner</i> in some ways, falling short in others, but never less than fully engaged in the notion of music as a higher ground.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A highlight on <i>Big Inner</i> was <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/matthew-e-white-will-you-love-me-video/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Will You Love Me""</a>, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22084-jimmy-cliff/"">Jimmy Cliff</a>-quoting slow-burner that gracefully balanced intimacy and studio craft. <i>Fresh Blood</i> refines this mix of cozy and majestic, with tracks spiraling out from just Fender Rhodes piano and hushed vocal to luxuriant codas replete with backup singers and ingeniously unfurling instrumental counterpoint. From the canopy of vibrant harmonies on ""Fruit Trees"" to the earthy guitar licks of ""Golden Robes"", the music feels both familiar and resplendent. White's mellow, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"">M. Ward</a>-like coo, occasionally patchy on <i>Big Inne</i><i>r</i>, is honeyed and smooth here.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lyrically, he builds on the themes of his debut and 2013's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18671-matthew-e-white-outer-face-ep/""><i>Outer Face</i> EP</a>.  The stormy ""Holy Moly"" echoes a line from the EP's ""Eyes Like the Rest"", about the perils of hope, before building to its mantra: ""Fuck 'em all, love is home, home is love, love is all."" (According to <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2015/03/01/388512027/first-listen-matthew-e-white-fresh-blood"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NPR</a>, the song is inspired by sexual abuse in the church, though you wouldn't necessarily know it.) Opener ""Take Care My Baby” reiterates some words about the human touch from the EP's ""Hot Hot Hot"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">White’s view of love and music remains decidedly spiritual: <i>Big Inner</i>’s finale, ""Brazos"",  for instance, climaxed in a stirring but ambivalent gospel chant of ""Jesus Christ is our Lord, Jesus Christ, He is your friend"". White relies on religious language much less here: When he calls upon Jesus on <i>Fresh Blood</i>'s ""Circle 'Round the Sun"", it's of a piece with the same song's use of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Dylan</a>-evoking phrase ""shelter from the storm.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At times, White’s knack for simplicity lapses into the slightly generic. On ""Take Care My Baby"", he confides, ""I never met another one like you before/ Talking all night long/ From the midnight on,"" and I mostly want to know what they were up so late talking about. A similar case is ""Feeling Good Is Good Enough"", which begins a compelling story about a couple who ""didn't make it"" rekindling their flame by going home together for the night, but ends with fairly rote ""Hey Jude""-like repetitions.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Elsewhere, White overreaches slightly. The poetic, dissonance-streaked hymn ""Tranquility"" was written as a tribute to Philip Seymour Hoffman, but it's forbiddingly cryptic. And White's wry rock crit on first single ""Rock &amp; Roll Is Cold"" creates an interesting tension with the song's spacey euphoria—think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a> vamping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/6404-the-200-greatest-songs-of-the-1960s/4/"">""I'm Waiting for the Man""</a>—but never quite coheres. Sure, the power of music is mysterious, but when you to try to sort out why his narrator specifically defines rock'n'roll as ""cold"", R&amp;B as ""free"", and gospel as a ""gift"", or ponder how those categories might overlap… well, the power of music is mysterious.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Those are small criticisms, though, and if you focus on the sumptuous sound of<i> Fresh Blood</i> they become easier to overlook. White addresses his musical ancestors directly on closer ""Love Is Deep"", asking, ""Ain't it so, Marvin?/ Ain't it so, Stevland?"" Gaye and Wonder (whom White pointedly addresses by his birth name) alike would probably affirm his argument —that ""love is deep shit,"" ""sweet shit."" It's not the deepest point, but White's musical chops ensure it's generally convincing.</p></div>"|20259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20259-fresh-blood/|6.7|Marc Hogan

And if early records like<i> Suspension</i> or <i>Reconnaissance</i>, with Martin Ng, tended to fixate on liquid oscillations and eyedropper drones, recent releases are putting his rhythmic sensibility front and center. Ambarchi's 2012 album <i>Sagittarian Domain </i>was propelled by an elliptical funk groove that moved between krautrock and post-punk. ""Knots"", from 2012's <i>Audience of One</i>, is largely a showcase for a scorching ride-cymbal fugue played by Joe Talia, and the recently released <i>Live Knots</i>, featuring Tokyo and Krakow performances of the piece, is even more intensely percussive, with Talia's drumming fighting to bring order to Ambarchi's torrential feedback. And now <i>Behold</i>, Ambarchi's new collaboration with Jim O'Rourke, picks up the rhythmic thread of the Australian musician's recent work and finds him back behind the drums.</p>
<p>At first, <i>Behold</i> sounds like a continuation of the ideas that Ambarchi and O'Rourke set out on <i>Indeed</i>, their 2011 debut LP as a duo. Like its predecessor, <i>Behold</i> is a single piece of music separated into two side-long sections. Within its 42-minute expanse, it combines multiple methods and approaches—real-time jams, electro-acoustic collage, synthesizers and guitar feedback, ambient dub and free improv—into a shape that's at once sprawling and streamlined.</p>
<p>It's really anyone's guess who is doing what. At the core of the music, there's a battle between brushed metal and scratchy percussive sounds, on the one hand, and luminous tonal elements on the other. The music is aglow with streaks of feedback, molten oscillators, rubbed wineglass rims, and even the occasional struck or held note. With music this abstracted, this gradual, small gestures count for a lot, so that a single pair of bass notes, played several measures apart, come to seem like a major theme. And while there are no melodies, per se, the way filament-like phrases flare up in the murk is nevertheless lyrical. Somewhere in the mix, there's what sounds like an organ, and that Hammond-like flutter imbues the album with lively, trembling movements, even when the music is comparatively still. There are drones like the buzz of airplanes high overhead and a forest's canopy worth of synthetic birdcalls. Beneath the crystal-faceted edges of the sound, the blur runs deep and dense.</p>
<p>What most separates <i>Behold</i> from <i>Indeed </i>is the new album's strong sense of groove, with Ambarchi carving deep patterns with ride cymbals and hi-hats and ultra-low, chest-caving kick drums. It feels like motorik distilled to its very essence, an IV drip of pure rhythm. Like everything else on the album, the drums come and go. For most of ""Behold A"", there's nothing more than a hint of cymbal tapped out in rolling, quarter-note pulses; for long stretches, there's not even that. Like an underground stream returning to the surface, the rippling metal pulse returns midway through ""Behold B"" and gradually gathers strength, rising in concert with squalls of guitar feedback and contrapuntal piano. After a long, slow climb, it's a quick climax; the beat dies, and the remaining sounds go sailing out into the abyss, like water over a cliff. But it's the rhythm that stays with you, long after silence has settled in. </p>
<p><i>Behold</i> is the kind of music where, depending upon the angle from which you approach it, you may perceive its overall effects in radically different ways. The music evolves so gradually, it's easy to find yourself wondering how you've wound up at a given point; there's a sense of traveling without moving, of zooming in and out between broad strokes and pinpoint details, toggling between distracted reverie and close attention.</p></div>"|20278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20278-behold/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

They were always slightly out of step with their 90’s Creation-era peers, most of whom appeared content to disappear behind a veil of tastefully shimmering feedback and lyrical obtuseness. Swervedriver, on the other hand, were more interested in <i>ripping</i>. Their guitars may have fed back through the requisite number of effects pedals—classic Swervedriver tshirts actually featured a connected bank of effects pedals rather than the band members—but rather than shrink into the feedback, Swervedriver married their guitar haze with nods to poppy psychedelia, American film noir, and songs about fast cars. They had more in common with bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Soundgarden (with whom they toured) than the more ethereal English bands (Ride, Lush, My Bloody Valentine) with whom they were forever lumped. Despite releasing four excellent records between 1991 and 1998, Swervedriver—plagued by label woes, lineup shifts, and bad timing—somehow never quite got their due.</p>
<p>Now, some 17 years since their last effort, (1998’s <i>99<sup>th</sup> Dream</i>), Swervedriver return with a record that wisely plays up to the band’s most formidable strengths. Reunion albums can be a tricky and sometimes disastrous business (just ask the Pixies), but <i>I Wasn’t Born To Lose You</i> manages the rare trick of actually enhancing the band’s legacy rather than tarnishing it. Hewing most closely to their most beloved releases (1991’s<i> Raise</i> and 1993’s <i>Mezcal Head</i>), <i>Born </i>is a remarkably unfussy collection of songs that could easily pass—for better or worse<span id=""docs-internal-guid-0894bf1d-f0b7-942d-f3ad-18008c930a96""><span>—</span></span>as a kind of lost album from the early 90’s.</p>
<p>Swervedriver’s strength always stemmed from the melodic interplay of guitarists Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge—a collaboration that, at its best, felt like watching a rocket take off at close range and having it subsequently blow up in your face. It’s hard not to use firework metaphors when describing the band’s music, which seems to function best as a series of blinding explosions and brilliant fade-outs. Tracks like “Last Rites” and “Everso” are not-so-distant cousins to the band’s early “Sandblasted”-era singles—overdriven riffs reign supreme and songs build with mantra-like power before collapsing into long passages of looping, blissed-out guitar lines. Lead single “Setting Sun” proves to be an accurate barometer of the record’s overall vibe—a sustained mid-tempo reverie pushed along by Franklin’s characteristically low-key vocals: “Pure solid gold, you’re not alone, hearing unseen sounds from the depths below…”</p>
<p>If there’s a complaint to be had with <i>I Wasn’t Born To Lose You</i> it’s that the record too often errs on the side of restraint. The furious, breakneck quality of classic Swervedriver tracks like ""Son of Mustang Ford” and “For Seeking Heat” is largely absent here, eschewed in favor of tracks that aspire to a kind of majestic dreaminess. With the exception of the propulsive “Deep Wound” and scuzz-rocking “Red Queen Arms Race” the record plays like a kind of sustained trance, everything buoyed by a sense of unwavering melody wrung out of guitars that—even when played gently—always seem to be turned up past eleven. “Behold this rhythmic creation, it’s beautiful and true” Franklin sings on “I Wonder?”—a nearly six-minute bit of gorgeously rendered guitar squall that closes the album. It’s a fitting description for the record itself—a collection of songs that may not necessarily venture into any new sonic territory for the venerable band, but ultimately doesn’t really need to. </p></div>"|20178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20178-i-wasnt-born-to-lose-you/|7.0|T.

With such a strong history behind you, putting together songs worth playing twice is more important than preserving vibes. Philadelphia doom quintet Crypt Sermon prove they’ve got plenty of songwriting mettle on their debut album, <i>Out of the Garden</i>. On it, they pay fervent tribute to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22996-candlemass/"">Candlemass</a> and Dio-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a>, and already show more personality than many bands who’ve been trying to do this sound for a much longer time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the first three songs on <i>Garden</i><span> almost follow the trajectory of </span><i>Epicus Doomicus Metallicus</i><span>, Candlemass’ first album from 1986. ""Temple Doors"" is </span><i>Garden</i><span>’s ""Solitude"", a lumbering stomp with a slight thrash bent. ""Doors""'s opening interlude isn’t as iconic as ""please let me die in solituuuuuuuude,"" but it sets the song’s tone. ""Heavy Riders"" boasts similarities to ""Demons Gate"" in that they’re both the meaner, more confident second tracks. What sets ""Riders"" apart is its biker-like swagger, American toughness to contrast their European influences’ more Gothic sensibilities. After a moodier opening track, you need a ripper like ""Riders"" to get momentum going, and it succeeds, with guitarists Steve Jansson and James Lipczynski conjuring up Black Sabbath ""Neon Knights"" rhythms. ""Byzantium"" takes pages from <i>Metallicus</i>'s ""Crystal Ball"", especially in the high-tension, high-drama opening leads. While they only last for the introduction, they color the rest of the song, with Jansson and Lipczynski’s trod carrying a more ominous weight. This shift is how subtlety best manifests itself in metal: not by deliberate understating, but by smart songwriting that keeps the album’s vibe intact while giving each song its own character.</span></p>
<p>The rest of the album doesn’t bear a whole lot of similarities to <i>Metallicus</i><span>, but it’s a fun coincidence, and the rest of the songs are well worth your attention. While ""Doors"" explored the contrast of their slow burns and galloping infernos, it really comes into form in ""Into the Holy of Holies"", with everyone delivering more charged performances. It’s the longest song on the record, and not concidently, their most ambitious. ""The Master’s Bouquet"" features gorgeous lead work that closes out the song: triumphant, but alluding to a pyrrhic victory. Underlying synths further score the sadness that lays beneath, but with knowledge that the leads are the star. Vocalist Brooks Wilson doesn’t have the dramatic flair of a Dio or a Messiah Marcolin, and if there were a time we needed an ultra-charismatic metal frontman it’d be now, but he’s got impressive pipes nonetheless. (Wilson handled bass in addition to vocals on the band’s demo but ceded the role to Hivelords’ Will Mellor to fully concentrate on singing, which will hopefully become more of a positive development.)</span></p>
<p>As far as contemporaries, Crypt Sermon’s closest relative would be Solitude Aeturnus, the Arlington, Texas band usually considered to be the American answer to Candlemass. (Vocalist Robert Lowe even sang for Candlemass for a few years.) They’ve never gotten their due, but also haven’t had a blazing trail to seize upon; one can only hope Crypt Sermon won’t face that curse. <i>Garden</i><span> is a debut most bands would light candles to Dio for, and with time, this band could be a true contender in doom.</span></p></div>"|20303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20303-out-of-the-garden/|7.5|Andy O'Connor

<p dir=""ltr"">Maco’s latest EP, <i>15</i>, comes just over a month after the release of a joint project with alt rap migrant Rome Fortune, <i>Yep</i>. That, in turn, came on the heels of a three-track EP called <i>Breathe</i>. All told, Maco’s released about seven projects in seven months, the bulk of which is concerned with destroying the misconception of him as a one-trick pony while not alienating those who hopped on the bandwagon. <i>15</i> tries to kill two birds with one stone by grafting singsongy hooks onto synth-smashing raps. Maco anticipates you come for shout-raps but asks you stay for everything else, and <i>15</i> is his latest bid to embrace his viral success without getting enveloped by it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lost in attempts to find the right chemical balance for staying power is Maco’s own personality. He comes across as flat in <i>15</i>’s one dimensional songwriting. The lyrics are often hollow regurgitations of frequently recycled ideas (See the half-baked sports motif of “Championships”: “Consistent Tom Brady, rookie Russell Wilson/ I will go the distance, win by feet, not inches”). There is no depth of character. When he isn’t yelling, it’s easier to tell he doesn’t have much to say. There isn’t a single mention of what makes him flawed or interesting. Instead it’s always about what he’s done, what he’s doing, and what he will do for the genre. OG Maco doesn’t seem to exist outside of his raps.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sometimes his energy makes up for it, like on the strobing “Homies”, but he’s just as prone to over-performing. He bulldozes through the productions of Metro Boomin and DJ Plugg and TM88 on “Legends” and “Mirror Mirror”, respectively, without giving them any breathing room. The former, an eerie affair, is particularly gorgeous, but drowned out by Maco’s earnest howling chorus. Even as he learns to rein in the colossal bawls, he is struggling to figure out just how to work around them.</p>
<p>There are a handful of moments where OG Maco exposes his weirdness and becomes intriguing. He adds two contrasting full-length tunes in singsong, the humming “Night Like This” and the warbling “Long Nights”, and despite different affects both shroud him in dense waves of atmosphere. He proves himself a surprisingly capable technician on “The New Kid”. On the title track, Maco worries that the clock may have started ticking on his career and it provides the only real glimpse into his thoughts. There’s some irony to a viral success worrying about his 15 minutes, but in pondering the time he has left Maco produces some of his most enlightening observations. It showcases what will keep him around when the shouts aren’t enough anymore: More introspective songwriting. There may be hope for him yet.</p></div>"|20317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20317-15-ep/|5.9|Sheldon Pearce

In their pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/452-funeral/""><i>Funeral</i></a> genesis, the group projected a startling intensity that often left their hands bloodied and bodies bruised; those <a href=""http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/600/sotc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">motorcycle helmets</a> you see in old concert photos weren’t so much costume props as necessary protective gear for a band prone to using their own heads as auxiliary drum kits. And in the middle of the melee you’d often find Will Butler, younger brother of lead singer Win, bearing the mischievous grin of a corrupted choir boy. As a utility-player multi-instrumentalist, Will’s musical presence isn’t always easy to parse from Arcade Fire’s orchestro-rock onslaught. But onstage, he’s the physical embodiment of the band’s music—deceptively mild-mannered, yet capable of going off without warning. Not surprisingly, his debut solo album makes a virtue of that instability.</p>
<p>Given that Arcade Fire’s last album, 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18667-arcade-fire-reflektor/""><i>Reflektor</i></a>, boasted a rollout strategy more carefully plotted than most military operations, <i>Policy</i> feels very much like an attempt to recapture some of the happy-accidental spontaneity that defined the band’s early years. Where most of Arcade Fire’s extracurricular pursuits—be it Richard Reed Parry’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/610-bell-orchestre/"">Bell Orchestre</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31334-sarah-neufeld/"">Sarah Neufeld</a>’s releases on <a href=""http://cstrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Constellation Records</a>, or the Oscar-nominated score for Spike Jonze’s <i>Her</i>—have served as avant-garde antidotes to the band’s anthemic grandeur, <i>Policy</i> revels in the early rock'n'roll and punk influences that have become an increasingly obscured cornerstone of the band’s sound (think: ""(Antichrist Television Blues)"", ""Month of May"", or the sock-hop denouement of ""Wake Up""). Recorded at New York’s hallowed Electric Lady Studios, this determinedly off-the-cuff album is nostalgic in sound, but endearingly off-kilter in spirit.</p>
<p>As a lead vocalist, Will sounds exactly as you would expect—i.e., like Win Butler’s wiseacre little brother—and though he’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58649-arcade-fires-will-butler-shares-song-inspired-by-isis/"">recently shown an interest in current events</a>, his lovelorn lyrical concerns here are several pounds less weighty than Arcade Fire’s conceptual statements about God and country. (When Jesus does enter the picture—via the folky, Westerbergian power-pop of ""Son of God""—it’s merely to be gently blasphemed.) At its most inspired, <i>Policy</i> resembles a screwball musical adaptation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a>’s <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/arts/12iht-12pang.10978303.html?_r=1&amp;"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lost weekend</a>. Rave-ups like ""Take My Side"", ""What I Want"", and ""Witness"" tumble out with infectiously inebriated energy, their charging choruses teetering on the brink like runaway trains. The bacchanalia is compounded by sloppy piano stabs and knowingly cornball come-ons that would make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3092-harry-nilsson/"">Harry Nilsson</a> flash a thumbs up while face down in puke. (To wit: ""If you come and take my hand/ I will buy you a pony/ We can cook it for supper/ I know a great recipe for pony macaroni."")</p>
<p>As Butler <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9586-will-butler/"">recently explained</a> to Pitchfork’s Evan Minsker, <i>Policy</i> is intended to reflect his omnivorous musical taste, but, as the album rolls on, the difference between cunning eclecticism and undercooked experimentalism grows stark. <i>Policy</i>'s highlights maintain a precarious balance between classicism and cataclysm, but the album often tips too far in either direction: the dirgey boombox disco of ""Something’s Coming"" and the cheap-sunglasses new wave of ""Anna"" suggest an alternate universe where Arcade Fire couldn’t afford <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5462-james-murphy/"">James Murphy</a>’s producer fee, while ""Sing to Me"" and ""Finish What I Started"" are sullen piano ballads that Butler's restrained vocals can't invest with the necessary gravitas. ""Someone please, finish what I started,"" he sings on the latter song, ""I tried my best, but my best was half-hearted."" It doubles as an uncomfortably on-the-nose diagnosis of the album itself.</p></div>"|20240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20240-policy/|6.6|Stuart Berman

Beginning with the 2009 debut EP<i> Arks Up </i>and the 2011 LP <i>New Start Again</i><i>, </i>they carved a national identity through songwriting in a way that'd been unfashionable enough to have virtually been forgotten. Attracting comparisons to Dunedin bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean</a>—an alleged influence the band are quick to protest—their jangly, working class rock inspired unlikely thinkpieces about new movements in Australian music towards reclaiming Australian-ness. Finally here was a band, the thinking went, that were proudly Australian without the conservative baggage, and could articulate the lives of working class youth—even make it seem romantic—with elegant melodies and deft lyricism, painting vibrant portraits of forlorn suburbs and tacit class warfare. This hefty burden culminated in 2013's <i>Calendar Days, </i>a record that, in retrospect, seems like their definitive collection.</p>
<p>Consisting of primary songwriters Rupert Edwards and Al McKay on guitar, and backed by Al Montfort (UV Race, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30145-total-control/"">Total Control</a>, Straitjacket Nation) and Steph Hughes on bass and drums respectively, Dick Diver face a burden in following such an auspicious release. But instead of trying for repeat glory, on <i>Melbourne, Florida, </i>they take a determined step forward.</p>
<p>Dick Diver have always been skeptical, if not cynical, about their culture, and there are signs they're becoming more scathing. True to life, on <i>Melbourne, Florida</i> relationships are mediated by glass. Departed lovers are mourned in endlessly scrolling old emails and windows become the projection sheets of better-left-forgotten memories. On ""Beat Me Up (Talk to a Counsellor)"", Al Montfort confronts the psychopathic condition of young males and on ""Competition"", Rupert Edwards' targets seem mindless and obsessed with warped trappings of fame. This is tempered by the striking ""Boomer Class"", which spits bile at the destruction of a family but is ultimately regretful that something so terrible should afflict people in the first place.</p>
<p>In an interview last month, Rupert Edwards said when Dick Diver start getting bad reviews, he can finally buy an Xbox—that certainty in life after the band has given them the faith to look outwards. The buzzsaw synth on ""Competition"" might've seemed unimaginable on <i>Calendar Days, </i>and Al McKay's ""Waste the Alphabet"" is more bombastic and loud than the prettiness of previous songs would suggest. Steph Hughes' crystalline voice has only gotten stronger on the swelling ""Leftovers"" and piano ballad ""View from a Shakey Ladder"". The rich, melody-stuffed jangle that scored them references to the Flying Nun catalogue has shipped off, replaced by chugging verses and the tropes of FM radio rock, the soundtrack to long drives down country roads.</p>
<p>The novelty of domestic signifiers has also been shed. Sucked into the void go Zamel's ads and TV Weeks and tourist attractions in the shape of sacred desert rocks, replaced by—as far as pop cult ephemera—Tonya Harding and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"">Fleetwood Mac</a>. But <i>Melbourne, Florida, </i>no matter the name, is no pander to the great republic. There are still signposts of nationality, only they're more subtle. ""Europe's fucked probably,"" a blasé Edwards sings, reflecting the cultural and geographical distance from the intercontinental headlines in a sick parody of those who see Europe as a theme park for backpacking. The fixation on everywhere but here, if anything, is even more Australian than the more obvious touchstones on previous records. On <i>Melbourne, Florida, </i>the ghosts of civilisations haunt television screens that not that long ago were propaganda machines beaming the best of faraway cultures distilled into caricature through the lounge rooms of their corner of the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>Dick Diver sound at peace on <i>Melbourne, Florida, </i>both certain of what they are now and certain that they could be almost anything in the future. Last year, Edwards was afraid that Dick Diver risked a dangerous entrenchment with the connotations the band had accrued, but this album<i> </i>breaks open new possibilities for them. Whether that's welcomed, or they have to pursue new careers in pro-gaming, <i>Melbourne, Florida </i>is an exciting progression to old fans, and a solid entry point for new audiences.</p></div>"|20185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20185-melbourne-florida/|7.8|Jake Cleland

Aside from the city’s ballad-centric but occasionally fierce Chi-Lites and a few bandwagon-jumping old-timers like Gene Chandler, Chicago’s major contribution to disco’s history was also a key event in its destruction: Shock jock Steve Dahl staged Comiskey Park’s Disco Demolition Night, a baseball-promotion-turned-riot in the summer of 1979 often credited as the tipping point of the genre’s so-called death in the mainstream.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that Dahl convinced African Americans or any other minority to suddenly stop dancing. As lovingly and obsessively documented by <i>Ultra High Frequencies,</i> the Windy City helped stoke some of disco’s funkiest, most soulful flames. While DJ Frankie Knuckles mixed the ingredients for what would become house for a diverse crowd at the Warehouse, an equally idiosyncratic scene went down at the straighter but still quirky CopHerBox II.</p>
<p>Launched in 1979 by trombonist Willie Woods and aspiring singer James Christopher, the publicity-hungry club hosted—along with assorted Miss CopHerBox pageants and Big Butt contests—its own TV program. Broadcast in 1982 on local UHF station WCIU, the original host of ""Soul Train"", ""The Chicago Party""<i> </i>one-upped its famous competitor by not simply approximating a typical Saturday club evening: It documented <i>exactly</i> what went down on those nights at the CopHerBox for 23 episodes.</p>
<p>Both the CD and double-vinyl editions of <i>Ultra High Frequencies</i> include a DVD featuring 23 musical performances, a brief documentary on the scene, and a 100-minute <i>Chicago Party </i>video<i> </i>mixtape. Between a swimsuit competition, circus-type contortions by the Phantom, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/484-james-brown/"">James Brown</a>-on-wheels splits via the Unknown Skater, android dance moves from CopHerBox regulars modeling the wares of designer Caroline Peeples, and the hosts’ own ""SNL""-inspired comedy hijinks, the mixtape overflows with highly entertaining shots of uninhibited adult couples shaking what their mamas gave them.</p>
<p>No doubt these dancers were boogying down to bigger names—acts like D-Train, the Dazz Band, Evelyn King, Junior, Skyy, Shalamar, and other disco-funk stars of 1982. But because this compilation comes from the Chi-Town obscurities-focused <a href=""www.numerogroup.com"">Numero Group</a>, their swiveling has been re-synced to vintage regional grooves, most of them so indie that they likely wouldn’t have gotten spins even in their home city.</p>
<p>One exception was Yvonne Gage, whose smooth and sensual late '81 single ""Garden of Eve"" appeared on <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/17700-RFC-Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RFC Records</a>, a major label affiliate that generated numerous anthems for New York’s Paradise Garage. Another was Magnum Force, a group that fused the sweaty bass-slapping stomps of Slave with the synth squiggles of the Time. They’re all over <i>UHF</i>: Their squishy slow jam ""Share My Love"" and brassy ""A Touch of Funk"" adorn the DVD, while the most anxious and libidinous cut, ""Girl You’re Too Cool"", brightens the album. All three would’ve charmed R&amp;B radio had their sole LP, '82’s <i>Share My Love</i>, received national promotion.</p>
<p>Much of the rest lack their polish, and the set’s most searing exceptions—male harmony quartet Closencounter’s violin-swept ""Without Your Love"", a pair of gospel-soul wailers from the female foursome Chicago’s Finest—appear only on the DVD because they most likely never got past the demo stage. Despite what crate-diggers hungry for proto-house obscurities may claim, disco was an emphatically hi-fi genre: A poorly recorded disc had to be otherwise good enough for most DJs to even temporarily compromise their equipment. ""The Chicago Party""’s low-budget local access charm enlivens the rawest tracks here, like Universal Togetherness Band’s urgent but nearly tone-deaf ""Pull Up"". The set’s catchiest track is Donnell Pitman’s ""Love Explosion""—six-plus minutes of music originally squeezed onto a tinny private-press seven-inch single. It repurposes Ripple’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_79hVLLgmPY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Beat Goes On and On""</a>, a 1977 <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/751-Salsoul-Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Salsoul Records</a> disco classic, via an overdubbed alternate male lead melody. Like the rest, it’s hardly definitive, but resourceful and resolutely spirited, and the remastering here gives Pitman the sonic space he deserved.</p>
<p>That familial energy lingers throughout. Hosts Woods and Christopher met while working for Model Cities, a government program that aimed to fight poverty while fostering inner city renewal and minority leadership. <i>Ultra High Frequencies</i> affirms that it was this spirit of communities taking care of their own that the duo brought to both their club and TV show. Despite the polyester-funk-meets-futurist-punk details that date stamp some fashions, most dancers are decked out in otherwise timeless, church-friendly threads that suggest how the era’s club scene brought a sense of the sacred into the secular world. ""The Chicago Party"" may have been fun-loving, even silly, but it serves as another fleeting example of disco’s ultimate spiritual purpose—elevation through togetherness.</p></div>"|20292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20292-ultra-high-frequencies-the-chicago-party/|7.5|Barry Walters

It’s not just that their own music is heavily indebted to specific and identifiable sounds and eras from the past—that describes 95% of all bands working today. It’s more that their particular combination of influences has actually had several waves of revivalism, so it’s hard to know which version they are drawing from. The band’s 2010 full-length debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15110-buy-the-ticket-take-the-ride/""><i>Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride</i></a>, was situated in a dreamy nu-Paisley Underground sphere that was, at that moment, quite fashionable. <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star/"">Mazzy Star</a> had been gone for a long time, and bands like <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/28370-tamaryn/"">Tamaryn</a>, <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/29704-widowspeak/"">Widowspeak</a>, and the Black Ryder were carrying their torch in different ways. The latter, a band fronted by Australians Aimee Nash and Von Ryper (they’ve since relocated to Los Angeles), took the group’s languid ballads and reverbed mystery and scuffed it up with JAMC distortion, and they showed a sure hand with the particulars even if the songs weren’t terribly memorable. For their ambitious follow-up, <i>The Door Behind the Door</i>, the Black Ryder burrow deeper, directly engaging with the '60s and early-'70s sources that inspired it all.</p>
<p>Inevitably, that sort of engagement implies a certain grandiosity. You take a song like, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">the Rolling Stones</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=the7gV99YRI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shine a Light""</a>, and you know it comes from an era when both the musicians and the audience were comfortable with the idea that rock stars should strive for something profound and sublime. For those playing rock music, that sometimes meant tapping into the textures of black gospel, specifically, adding a chorus at just the right moment to take the rootsy earthiness of the musical form and send it to the heavens.</p>
<p>Midway through <i>The Door Behind the Door</i> is a song called ""Throwing Stones"", which begins with a strummed acoustic guitar playing a resigned refrain and then builds, piece by piece, to a climax where massed voices are singing ""Let your love shine on/ If you want to be free."" It’s almost shocking in its pompousness, in part because the Black Ryder are, after all, a smaller independent band, and you don’t expect them to be making gestures that presumably cost a certain amount of money to get right. But there is also something admirable about the initiatve, that they are going for it to this degree.</p>
<p>There are many details on <i>The Door Behind the Door</i> that the Black Ryder get right, which, with music like this, is an accomplishment in itself. The moaning feedback drone in ""Seventh Moon"" has the gorgeousness of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ylunl72PyE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Neil Halstead lead</a>, ""Let Me Be Your Light"" has a candy-kissed psychedelic swirl, strings and all, that serves as the perfect backdrop for Nash’s whispery vocals, and ""Until the Calm of Dawn"" brings to mind the acid-fried Disneyfications of prime <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/"">Mercury Rev</a>, with a twinkly music box set against a sweeping orchestral arrangement. The band loves the strings so much they close with ""(Le Dernier Sommeil) The Final Sleep"", a cinematic 12-minute instrumental coda that brings to mind beautifully-shot imagery that makes you feel like you should probably be feeling something.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a> is another band that has been down this particular road, but something about the fact that Jason Pierce’s obsessions with drugs, death, and religion had years to marinate makes it easier for him to get away with Wagnerian bombast. Coming from a band like the Black Ryder, where they know the sound and the history but don’t offer much in terms of personality, it’s harder not to fixate entirely on the formal elements of the music, rather than the things that might make it personal. That leads to records where you listen to and admire them from a distance instead of getting immersed in them.</p></div>"|20234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20234-the-door-behind-the-door/|6.0|Mark Richardson

He doesn’t appear to be a coal miner, or a factory worker, but a regular guy with a sharp haircut and a bespoke suit. Handsome, too. How dare he? I’m comfortable in assuming most people would instinctively roll their eyes, and wish this guy back to the Dust Bowl.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Tom Brosseau pulls it off, somehow, collapsing decades of folk tradition into an identity that feels not only modern, but believable. </span><i>Perfect Abandon</i><span>, his latest LP, is an endearing collection of pastoral narratives and humble melodies that sounds unearthed from the Gaslight Cafe, where minor folk singers plied their trade and presented their authenticity for analysis in the early '60s. It was recorded naturalistically, with just a single microphone capturing Brosseau and his three-piece band. That accounts for the looseness—the way the arrangements fall together, like when the kick drum rumbles into the mix on ""Roll Along With Me"" like a steam engine creaking into motion. Brosseau's handle on his acoustic guitar, the album's predominant instrument, will not blow you away. But he sounds like he's right in the room with you, which is the least a folk singer can hope to convey on record.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Brosseau sketches his origin story on ""Hard Luck Boy"", where you understand he wasn’t being wry about his self-appointed moniker. The apparently autobiographical song is about how, as a child, Brosseau was abandoned by his mother in a department store. ""That's how it all happened, all those years ago, when I was just a boy,"" Tom Brosseau drawls in a voice both quiet and sonorous, ""and to this day I have never seen my mother.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>How it all happened </span><span>and </span><span>all those years ago</span><span>—it’s a singer approaching his life story as mythology, oral history, biblical text. Brosseau was raised religiously, and </span><i>Perfect Abandon</i><span> is not only peppered with references to God, but to the spiritual quandaries that arise when a serious person begins considering God as more than just an all-powerful guy who lives in the sky. On ""Tell Me Lord"", he asks God if the darkness he sees in the world is only temporary; on ""Landlord Jackie"", he balances his faith against his desires for the married Jackie, and concludes, ""trying to be faithful only increases the volume of the voice that says ‘It's all right, what are you waiting for, jump on in.’"" Brosseau sounds overwhelmed by the temptations of the world around him—his breathless paeans to ""your voice, your breath, your style of hair"" on ""Take Fountain""—and softly humbled about his place amongst all this majesty.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-f43f9111-e6b2-82ba-aa0a-c4236907d1cd""><span>I’m reminded of the novelist Marilynne Robinson, whose work grapples with similar dilemmas in a similarly world weary voice. A 2007 Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10942-cavalier/"">review</a> criticized Brosseau’s music for its smallness. But acknowledging one’s smallness can be its own virtue, and while Brosseau’s music splits from folky tradition by being pointedly unpolitical, his deference to the world around him comes with its own admirable grace. He presents his cautious optimism on ""The Wholesome Pillars"", his voice hesitant and earnest as the band trails behind him like a slow river. ""Defend yourself, dear one, from the voice that says you must die,"" he sings, before disappearing back into the country, aware of his luck but determined to press on. </span></span></p></div>"|20302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20302-perfect-abandon/|7.0|Jeremy Gordon

The music honored their specific styles and signatures while spinning a new and interesting whole. More than 2014’s tepid and somewhat soulless <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19139-skrillex-recess/"">Recess</a></i>, <i>Spring Breakers</i> hinted at a vision of Skrillex as someone whose output might be deeper than the drop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Jack Ü</i>, the long-rumored EP and partnership between EDM heavyweights <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a> and Skrillex, is not like that at all. Instead, it’s roughly the sum of its parts—Skrillex’s frenetic drop-heavy monoliths paired with Diplo’s frequent attempts at world-music-curation and general boner for eclectic collaboration. While some of <i>Jack Ü</i> soars above reasonable expectation—the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32021-kiesza/"">Kiesza</a> collaboration ""Take Ü There"" and its equally energizing remix featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy Elliott</a>, for example—it mostly registers as a fun, low-stakes affair with its finger often too close <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCawU6BE8P8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to the button</a>. Given that the surprise release was celebrated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58648-skrillex-and-diplo-surprise-release-debut-jack-u-album-featuring-missy-elliott-2-chainz-alunageorge-kiesza-more/"">a livestreamed 24-hour-party</a>, it’s easy to call the collaboration a success, at least on its own terms.</p>
<p>This sort of project lives and dies by the quality of its features. <i>Jack Ü</i> finds the right people—Kiesza, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"">AlunaGeorge</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a> (""Yeah I am the shit/ So I should have Febreeze on it""), ragga soca artist Bunji Garlin—and makes the collaborations memorable. ""Where Are Ü Now"", in particular, builds  around an effervescent Justin Bieber vocal that surprises in all of the right ways—I wouldn't be surprised to see Bieber use the song as an effective bridge to the more mature sounds he coveted on 2013's <i>Journals</i>. In general, <i>Jack Ü </i>is massive-sounding, stuffed to the brim with snares, clipped vocal samples, and colossal Skrillex-starter-set WUB WUB WUB bass drops, but Skrillex and Diplo carve out enough space for lower-key, fun-loving moments. Over nine tracks, there are definite misfires—the volatile throb of ""Holla Out"" scans as something that could live well on Clickhole while also reminding me of the fiendish <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAj3lOyv3s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Left Swipe Dat"" song</a>—but <i>Jack</i> <i>Ü </i>ultimately gets its very specific job done. </p>
<p>Above all, this is maximalist party music that captures a specific moment in time. (Sample song title: ""Jungle Bae"".) <i>Jack Ü </i>is nothing but a fount of stomping, outrageous EDM, the kind that basically serves as a security deposit for $75k-a-night residencies in Vegas. While <i>Jack <i>Ü</i></i> doesn't exactly roll the ball forward, or do much else to make listeners rethink the principal actors here, it's dumb, loud fun from two architects of the dumbest, loudest fun of the 2000s.</p></div>"|20326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20326-skrillex-and-diplo-present-jack-u/|6.8|Corban Goble

Those facts alone do not a college rock record make, but there’s no denying the subgenre’s omnipresence on <i>Universal Coolers</i>. Singer/guitarist Lindsay Baker’s guitar tangles with Chris Diken’s in an emulation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3829-sleater-kinney/"">Sleater-Kinney</a>’s anthemic brawniness, and fuzzy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"">Built to Spill</a> chord progressions anchor tempestuous licks. Adding a bass guitar to the trio’s mix might provide a grounding force for potentially bigger payoffs, but you get the feeling the Brooklyn band don’t want their angular jumps and careening hooks to be held down anyway.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Radical Dads are best when they’re youthful and antagonistic, and though this record isn’t a huge leap for the band, it does signal a realization of where their strength lies. While <i>Mega Rama</i> and <i>Rapid Reality</i> found solace in a few minimal, desert road melodies, <i>Universal Coolers</i> refuses to quiet down. Lyrically, Baker delivers lighthearted teenage colloquialisms with a knowing wink, whether she’s encouraging pizza consumption (""Cassette Brain""), observing others ""making out"" (""DJ Pancake""), or resigning to watch TV because there’s ""nothing to do but chill"" (""Slammer"").</p>
<p class=""normal"">Diken provides snotty vocals on outlier ""Flight to NZ"", a stream-of-consciousness narrative that moves unexpectedly into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10326-daydream-nation-deluxe-edition/""><i>Daydream Nation</i></a>-like freak­out of screeching guitars. Sometimes, he stumbles over callow or clumsy phrasing, and it’s difficult to take his stoic closing proclamation that ""there’s no city of light""<b> </b>seriously. The ebullient opener ""Absurd Tests"" is much better, the strain behind Baker’s disaffected shout-singing sounding as unapologetic as the bed of noise backing it. ""Got middle fingers on both hands/ Gonna break up all my bands,"" she avows.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Nearly every track is teeming with distortion pedals and pop melodies, but ""Cassette Brain"" is the album’s most potent moment. The title alone taps into their aesthetic—it’s easy to imagine the band members trading <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean</a> tapes or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3358-polvo/"">Polvo</a> 7-­inches before ending up in a basement jam session. Despite a mid­tempo pace—the record’s most leisurely cut—it never drags, with limber arpeggios ricocheting off of a hiccuping drum fill. Baker’s lyrics offer slithering hints of Rad Dads’ industrial home base in Brooklyn’s Gowanus neighborhood (""We might get swept away/ Won’t you clear the toxic sludge from my head?/ We’ll build an armory/ Protect our collections with walls made of lead""). The breathing space in the arrangement and the subdued tone point a possible way forward for the threesome.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Ultimately, it’s difficult for <i>Universal Coolers</i> to be pinned down to one completely cohesive thought. Radical Dads are still investigating what indie rock has to offer, how they can toy with their forebears’ foundations while digging jagged pathways outwards. But they probably wouldn’t be attempting this ambitious exploration together if they didn’t have fun along the way, and their energy is infectious.</p></div>"|20308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20308-universal-coolers/|7.2|Tess Duncan

These early releases suggested a budding technical brilliance and a desire to take black metal as far as it could go, but none were adequate preparation for Mastery’s first full-length. <i>Valis</i> is an exercise in hyperactive neuron overload, one of the more challenging black metal albums in recent memory.</p>
<p>This is the first time Ephemeral Domignostika’s vision has been so clear; the memorable riffs are here, but he pushes them all to their breaking point. He plays with the velocity of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthrelm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Orthrelm"">Orthrelm</a>'s Mick Barr and the inventiveness of Gridlink’s Takafumi Matsubara. To call this music ""dense"" would be an understatement, as he piles on the skronky twists and synapse-melting tapping, pausing only for a couple of ambient interludes (""A.S.H.V.E.S.S.E.L."" and ""I.L.K.S.E.E.K.E.R."") and moments where the electrified spasms give way to acoustic strumming (""V.A.L.I.S.V.E.S.S.E.L."") while frantic drums and scowls continue. Mastery is polarizing, but unlike Ephemeral Domignostika’s one-man-band project <span>Pandiscordian Necrogenesis, </span>the music is much more than a cheap spectacle.</p>
<p>Because for all of <i>Valis</i>' chaotic energy, Ephemeral Domignostika remains a keen tactician, with each improvised freakout compressed, cut up into dizzying pieces, and put in place. It sounds like it was created in one take, with no edits, which would be impossible. But the knowledge that he composed the album from jams, integrating the best of improvisational spontaneity and metal’s tradition of rigid composition, and in the process making sense of his own madness, is just as staggering.</p>
<p>There are sections where a righteous black thrash riff will come in, something that demands only your most vigorous headbanging and your fists raised as high as you can raise them—the opening pummel of ""V.A.L.I.S.V.E.S.S.E.L."", which he also revisits in ""S.T.A.R.S.E.E.K.E.R.""—but just as soon as these come to fruition, Ephemeral Domignostika will break it down and switch to another sequence equally as turbulent but even less comprehensible. While Mastery never abandons black metal, his ability to nod to catchy riffs while also surgically dismembering them is what elevates him above would-be avant-metallists.</p>
<p><i>Valis</i> appears just as one-time Bay Area compatriot <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5778-leviathan/"">Leviathan</a> is gaining attention—and in some eyes, redeeming himself—for his latest, and most accomplished, record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20094-scar-sighted/""><i>Scar Sighted</i></a>. Both are triumphs of singular visions, the ethos of one-man black metal fully realized. While <i>Scar Sighted</i> is an examination of a troubled self, <i>Valis</i> is a warning to let you know just what Ephemeral Domignostika is capable of and how far he’s willing to scramble his mind for his music. It’s not an album for the stubborn traditionalists, nor is it for the newcomers who preach open-mindedness but are too timid to really engage with the art.</p></div>"|20272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20272-valis/|8.0|Andy O'Connor

Sure you do. And the version that comes to mind is probably Crookers' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVb_t_ao9gw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mix</a>, for good reason. Combining that irresistible hook, and Cudi's lackadaisical flow, with the Italian duo's cleverly kinetic beats, the 2008 remix hinted at an exciting new world of internationally minded rap-dance crossover. Unfortunately, as a glance at the ""#trap"" tag on SoundCloud could tell you, said crossover hasn't worked out as well as hoped, and Crookers' 2010 album <i>Tons of Friends</i> is one indicator of where the train began to go off the rails. Stuffed with guest vocalists (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2357-kelis/"">Kelis</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10892-pitbull/"">Pitbull</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7625-william/"">will.i.am</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4159-spank-rock/"">Spank Rock</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2963-roisin-murphy/"">Roísín Murphy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9401-rye-rye/"">Rye Rye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9077-yelle/"">Yelle</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27863-miike-snow/"">Miike Snow</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1245-drop-the-lime/"">Drop the Lime</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steed_Lord"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steed Lord</a>, et al) and bereft of any coherent through line, the album reeked of something dreamed up in a record label's boardroom. </p>
<p>Crookers' follow-up, the 2011 album <i>Dr Gonzo</i>, kept a tighter guestlist (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24758-the-savage-skulls/"">Savage Skulls</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_of_Eye"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Style of Eye</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8473-surkin/"">Surkin</a>, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/bobmo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bobmo</a>) and retreated to the duo's wheelhouse: boisterous, big-room club jams laced with woozy LFOs and vuvuzela. It also got them (briefly) signed to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a>'s <a href=""http://maddecent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Decent</a>. But it failed to make much of a mark, and at this point, Crookers—now a solo act, following a 2012 split between Francesco ""Phra"" Barbaglia and his former bandmate, Andrea ""Bot"" Fratangelo—is one of those perennially touring workhorses seemingly forever relegated to mid-sized font on festival lineups. His new album, <i>Sixteen Chapel</i>, suggests that lowered expectations can actually be liberating.</p>
<p>The album gets off to a good start with a pair of tracks that play to his strengths. ""Picture This"" brandishes a manic dial-tone melody and drums as crunchy as a wood-chipper; ""Ability to Maximize"" assembles a hyperkinetic array of tuned kicks and video-game bleeps around a whimsical flute melody. Both flash back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10842-roman-flugel/"">Roman Flügel</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2dQptUXSDc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Geht's Noch?""</a>, that brief moment when underground techno flirted with levity, and muscular beats and hypnotic grooves weren't necessarily incompatible with a sense of fun.</p>
<p>He returns to this mode throughout the album, with varying degrees of success. At their best—like ""Sgeddo"", which filters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10512-the-bomb-squad/"">the Bomb Squad</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15826-raymond-scott/"">Raymond Scott</a> through fidgety house, or the squelchy ""128BPM"", a tribute to his favorite tempo—his productions boast inventive and astonishingly detailed sound design, with all manner of sonic non sequiturs fitting together into nonsensical patterns that nevertheless make a kind of intuitive, <i>sensory</i> sense. But he doesn't always know where to take those impulses. ""WTP"" samples a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fle5uGpBcc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York ballroom staple</a> without bringing anything new to the table; ""Heavy"" gets bogged down with an unremarkable house beat and, worse, an extended orgasm in the breakdown.</p>
<p>For all the precision of his sound design, you get the sense that Crookers isn't quite so adept at actually structuring and sequencing songs. ""Belly Button Tickler"", featuring a muttered cameo from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Muthafuckin%27_eXquire"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. MFN eXquire</a>, is damn near interminable, and it's only five minutes long. The trip-hop study ""Dangerous"" is even more torpid, and the singer MDNT's heavy-breathing clichés (""There's danger inside/ Your lips, your thighs"") don't help much. In fact, save the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a>-fronted ""I Just Can't"", all of the album's vocal tracks feel flawed. Musically, ""Mark It Up"", featuring Beldina, is an exhilarating homage to classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/300-basement-jaxx/"">Basement Jaxx</a>, but the narrator's fantasy of smearing lipstick on her boyfriend's collar (""I just wanna mark up my man,"" goes the chorus) reads like a <i>Cosmopolitan</i><i> </i>sidebar. ""Get Excited"", featuring the Philly rapper STS, is a pro-forma strip-club jam. And then there's ""Strokin'"", a brassy co-production with the Los Angeles ""bounce"" producer TJR, in which the Bay Area rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31017-antwon/"">Antwon</a> walks us through a night that starts with a gram and a half and finishes in the 69 position: ""Then she did some shit that you couldn't believe/ The booty in my face sucked the life up outta me."" Well, OK, then.</p>
<p>It's missteps like that one that suck the life out of <i>Sixteen Chapel</i>—an album whose name presumably comes from its 16 tracks, even though three of those are obvious filler sketches. (One of those, meanwhile, is just a snippet of audio ripped from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxRX6LXDpWs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No No No Cat""</a>, which at least feels like an appropriate response to ""Strokin'"".) By the album's closing track—""Ghetto Guetta"", a punchline masquerading as a song that first premiered nearly a year and a half ago—Crookers has long since worn out his welcome.</p></div>"|20294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20294-sixteen-chapel/|5.5|Philip Sherburne

But despite that tag—and despite the fact that they had a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16890-see-the-world-given-to-a-one-love-entity/"">Rastafarian extraterrestrial</a> on one of their record sleeves—the rapturous emotional peaks and torturous noisemaking that Drewchin contributed to the group always rendered their explorations more ritualistic and earthy than that label suggests. Their interest in psychedelic experience is more ideological than aesthetic, an idea that carries through on Drewchin's first full-length release as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32755-eartheater/"" target=""_blank"">Eartheater</a>, <i>Metalepsis</i>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Drewchin displays an all-consuming interest in blurring boundaries that burrows all the way down to the record's textural details. Leadoff track ""Macro EV"" dances between delicate reverse-delayed electric guitar plinks and needly loops of her own vocals, teetering on the brink between swooning and sickly. Drewchin plays with these opposing textures over the course of the record, imbuing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17320-eartheater-homonyms/"" target=""_blank"">""Homonyms""</a>—the most tuneful and immediate of her folkier efforts—with lurching and chattering vocal exercises. She's upending the conventions of folk and ambient music—taking little excursions into harsher realms, just for good measure—gracefully crossing stereotypical divides between genres without even really letting you notice that she's done so. It's a sort of sonic <i>jamais vu: </i>All of the ingredients feel familiar, but the whole that they eventually make up remains alien and unattainable.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There are also moments where Drewchin intentionally jars us, delivering seemingly absurd elements (such as the minute-long Eastern European rap sample at the end of ""Youniverse""). But even those play seriously in context. In the tradition of most who consider themselves experimenters, the origin of the sounds Drewchin uses become muddled. There are samples from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1581-john-frusciante/"">John Frusciante</a> solo experiments and stabbing string sections, and all manners of instrumentation both recorded and synthesized. What's a product of the organic world and what's a product of her array of electronic equipment is suddenly unclear. Her treatment lightly suggests that all of these varying parts should be treated and approached the same way, like a utopian psych-folk that embraces electronic instrumentation.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Drewchin's lyrical concerns, too, center on interstitial spaces: between the natural world and the digital (""The Internet Is Handmade""), between the subjective truth and objective reality (""Infinity""), and between the self and the cosmos (""Youniverse""). Throughout she embraces thematic abstraction and philosophical ambiguities as guiding principles. In other words, Drewchin may not have everything quite figured out, and her insistence on posing questions rather than answers elevates <i>Metalepsis</i> into a compelling document of postmodern (and importantly, post-Internet) confusion. <i>Metalepsis </i>is music that's built to overwhelm and envelop you, and maybe even, as Drewchin's moniker suggests, swallow worlds whole.</span></p></div>"|20277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20277-metalepsis/|7.5|Colin Joyce

Eight years ago on <i>Hissing Fauna,</i> Nina Aimee Grøttland, aka <a href=""http://geminitactics.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nina Twin</a>, was Barnes’ newly reconciled wife as he struggled with an imbalance of brain chemicals, drugs, and love. Eight years later, <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1709094/qa-kevin-barnes-on-of-montreals-next-album-aureate-gloom/franchises/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Barnes and Grøttland have separated</a>, and now he wonders if<b> </b>perhaps the natural order of the world <i>is</i> imbalance.  </p>
<p>Hearing Barnes sing about Grøttland—<span>somehow a part of every Of Montreal album, lyrically or otherwise, since </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5954-satanic-panic-in-the-attic/"" target=""_blank"">Satanic Panic in the Attic</a></i><i>—</i>anchors <i>Aureate Gloom</i> in reality. On <i>Fauna</i>, Barnes strangled his heart inside of<b> </b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3RAI8Ntamw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Past Is a Grotesque Animal""</a>, an opus about his strained relationship with Grøttland. Now Barnes tempers his feelings with melancholy, and instead of some catastrophic metaphor, we get, simply: ""You never did me wrong, we just been together too long, babe.""</p>
<p>Which is to say, while there's still plenty of Barnesian lyrical rhapsodies here, there's also a refreshing ease, helped in part by the backing group he's been using since 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18606-of-montreal-lousy-with-sylvanbriar/""><i>lousy with sylvianbriar</i></a>. No longer a dusty, paisley San Francisco band, they’ve become '70s New York art punks. This is thoroughly an electric guitar album, and references to<b> </b><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"">Television</a> abound (the guitar riff on the verse of ""Last Rites at the Jane Motel"" is a direct homage to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlbunmCbTBA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Marquee Moon""</a>). Set against this wiry, mid-gain pastiche, Barnes' voice adopts a glittery, damaged glam rock tone that falls right in with the musical palette.</p>
<p>This consonance, coupled with Barnes' starkly personal lyrics, make this album one of the least inscrutable in their catalog. <i>Aureate Gloom</i><b> </b>feels like it belongs in <i>our</i> universe, not some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14640-false-priest/"">spartan funk galaxy</a> borne out of the recesses of Barnes' mind. ""I’m grieving for you, my love"" he sings, so innocently, on ""Virgilian Lots"" before adding, ""And I don't understand what's going on."" It is straight up shocking to hear Barnes at a loss for words.<b> </b>Of course, just after his bemusement, he falls back on psycho-Marc Bolan patter on ""Monolithic Egress"". In a series of admissions and realizations (including what sounds like a specific reference to the dissolution of pet names, ""I’m not a different man ‘cause you now call me some fucked up name"") Barnes beats his chest around an ever-shifting garage rock template. It jumps from a fried take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Zeppelin</a>’s ""Immigrant Song"" to a kaleidoscopic, proggy psych dream, and inside-out and back around again.</p>
<p>This bounding, perforated punk sound is enjoyable on its own terms, though you wonder what could’ve been if this band didn’t work so modularly in fits and starts. A highlight, ""Empyrean Abattoir"", starts with Barnes' hushed singing, slowly building with his signature three-part harmonies, carrying the song fluidly until we get to the skittering 5/4 section and Barnes' emotions get the best of him. He sings, now with more distortion on his mic, ""Now it’s just a system of subtraction."" Which, yes, breaking up <i>is</i> just a system of subtraction, but it’s not exactly a graceful turn of phrase. For every disarmingly honest moment, in other words, there is an equal and opposite moment where Barnes obfuscates, to unclear ends. These sudden shifts make it fun to follow Kevin Barnes, but difficult to get close to Kevin Barnes.</p>
<p>Of Montreal's concept has migrated as erratically as the tempo shifts and time changes on <i>Aureate Gloom</i>, so much that it’s hard to find their natural center now. So, our attention spans drift away. By the time the chaos of the bitter closer ""Like Ashoka’s Inferno of Memory"" comes on like an overcooked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">Bowie</a> tribute, it’s hard to feel connected to the soul of this group. Even though Barnes is trying so desperately to figure out what’s happening in front of him, it’s a barbed mess behind him. Ultimately the music becomes another mask, another thing Barnes is trying to untangle, in a great chapter in the lengthy, wonderfully ornate Of Montreal compendium. That’s the paradox with Of Montreal: the more they create, the less you know them.</p></div>"|20314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20314-aureate-gloom/|7.0|Jeremy D. Larson

That album didn't sound like the emergence of a college-aged songwriter so much as it played like an experiment from someone who had already gotten good at putting music together. Full of nerves and breath and blood, <i>Ripely Pine</i> whipped folk tropes into rock'n'roll rambunctiousness, giving her plenty of space to sound precocious. On her second album, <i>After</i>, Spaltro hits one of the unexpected truths of your twenties: that embracing your repressed childlike instincts is one of the more adult things you can do.</p>
<p><i>Ripely Pine</i> struck out big, with elegant metaphors rooted in the natural world. <i>After</i>'s track list includes a song called ""Milk Duds"", suggesting that Lady Lamb's tone has shifted from <i>Ripely</i>'s seven-minute ballad ""You Are the Apple"". ""We fell asleep on a box of Milk Duds,"" she sings on the new song. ""They melted into the clubhouse cushions/ I never loved another person/ More than I loved you when I woke that morning."" That sticky mess doesn't make the prettiest image in the traditional sense, but Spaltro's probably the first songwriter to find a symbol of her love in a pile of chocolate and caramel and polyester. She's getting braver.</p>
<p><i>After</i> is heartsick to its core—the title seems to eulogize a love affair in a single word—but it's much rowdier than its lyrics alone would imply. On opener ""Vena Cava"", Spaltro looks at her sleeping partner and sees the fiery death of their relationship as though it's already happening in slow motion all around her. ""I can feel how the seams of your ribs will separate from the seams of my ribs,"" she sings. ""I know already how much TV will fail to comfort me in your absence."" She switches from two ribcages unraveling to a melancholic Netflix binge in one line. And the song's a jam to boot.</p>
<p>Her lyrical muscle lets Lady Lamb oscillate between the visceral and the mundane without so much as a knowing lilt in her voice. Both modes come easily to her, and the tension between them is fertile. There's a parallel tension in the music, too: The strongest songs on <i>After </i>verge on acoustic despondency only to break into a big, crunchy chorus. You can always weep out the pain, but sometimes it's so much more fun to mosh it off.</p>
<p>There are plenty of startling moments full of guts and gristle in Lady Lamb's dense lyrics, and then there are the moments when she wanders. The fingerpicked ""Sunday Shoes"" stretches out between the shoegaze-inflected ""Heretic"" and ""Spat Out Spit"", injecting a weird bubble of space into the album's flow. The rousing coda on ""Penny Licks"" almost feels like an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> climax, even though it only arrives in the seventh song. Like <i>Ripely Pine</i>, <i>After</i> clocks in at a solid hour—and it's an hour you'll feel, because while <i>After</i> boasts a stacked lineup of well-crafted songs, it's a choppy ride to make it through them all.</p></div>"|20201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20201-after/|7.4|Sasha Geffen

With<i> Shadow of the Sun</i>, their third full-length effort, Moon Duo often approach the former state, and only occasionally slip into the latter. Singer-guitarist Ripley Johnson and singer-keyboardist Sanae Yamada are joined on record by drummer John Jeffrey, and the consistent use of live drums—Jeffrey was only added to the band’s full-time roster after their<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19654-moon-duo-live-in-ravenna/""> 2013 European Tour</a>—does a lot to imbue the winding, floating sound with some physical power.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Although <i>Shadow of the Su</i><i>n</i> is rooted in psychedelia, there are elements of proto-punk all over it, darkening the songs and making them more human. ""Wilding"", the album's standout opening track, resembles one of Jonathan Richman’s more uptempo songs, tinged with a tinny Haight-Ashbury tambourine and some wigged-out synths. Johnson’s solos, which can occasionally wander, are concise and focused here, setting an energetic stage for what’s to come.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Shadow of the Sun</i> is psych for the city, and even in its more ascendant moments, a thin veil of industrial grit, leaning towards krautrock, keeps the record from ever really floating skyward. Their last LP, 2012’s Ralph Waldo Emerson-inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17121-circles/""><i>Circles</i></a>, hinted at a relationship to nature. But unlike fellow drugged-out craftsmen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4815-brightblack-morning-light/"">Brightblack Morning Light</a>, whose hazy, shimmering songs are all palo santo and desert light, Moon Duo’s creepy synths and razor-sharp guitars never venture into more magical realms.</p>
<p>None of the songs on <i>Shadow of the Sun</i> sound new, but the familiar sounds create an atmosphere of safety that allows the more unexpected elements of the record all the more noteworthy. Occasionally, as on ""Night Beat"" and ""Zero"", the synths reach horror-movie levels, toeing the line between new wave and pure camp. The riff to ""Slow Down Low"" is more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"">Bethany Cosentino</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"">Jerry Garcia</a>, and the song’s precise, languid gentleness accomplishes what psych does at its best; it transports the listener to that place just outside of reality, where it’s ok to drop out and just float for awhile. It’s a shame that this effect isn’t more consistent throughout <i>Shadow of the Sun</i>, but in the moments when the campy, dirge-like darkness lifts, it shines bright.</p></div>"|20316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20316-shadow-of-the-sun/|6.6|Maud Deitch

He’s never been worried about repeating himself. The Sea and Cake made a few outstanding albums and a few more good ones; as a singer and guitarist, Prekop made two fine full-lengths that were different from his work in the Sea and Cake, but not markedly so. And now he’s returned with his second album of solo electronic music in five years, and it has many things in common with the last one.</p>

Unlike, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, Prekop’s electronic music never feels like commentary, and unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28087-arp/"">Arp</a> the influences are more open-ended. Many of these tracks sound like they could have been made in 1975 or 1985. Simple, clean tones bubble along, tracing melodies that evoke a wide-eyed kind of retrofuturism, redolent of an era when we hoped that technology could save humanity from itself. But even that marker seems slippery. The first nine all bear the title ""The Republic"" and were assembled as part of an art installation, but titles (later ones include ""Ghost"" and ""Invisible"") are meaningless. This is music that proudly exists as sonic information, music that invites you to meditate on how a simple tone with a halo of white noise, pulsing along in medium tempo and working through different melodic combinations along a major scale, makes you feel.</p>
<p>Importantly, as with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14654-old-punch-card/""><i>Old Punch Card</i></a>, it asks such questions but doesn’t offer any particular answers. <i>The Republic</i> would make a lousy film soundtrack because the music is defined by its ambiguity. Some might hear mystery in this music, some might hear something chill and late-night ambient, some might hear a bright and sunny affirmation, but Prekop’s relationship to sound can’t be summed up so neatly. As with his song lyrics, his electronic music is built for in-between spaces that are experienced very differently depending on the listener’s perspective.</p>
<p>Only in a few places does <i>The Republic</i> move outside its strict analog synth palette. ""The Republic 9"" incorporates what sound like samples of a harp, and ""Weather Vane"" briefly features a thudding 4/4 kick, but even that surprising turn is quickly subsumed back into the album’s more open-ended drift. Extremes of any kind have no place here. Even the tag ""music"" doesn’t always seem accurate. Passages from the installation make you wonder if you’re listening to an extremely quiet drone or just the sound of something being plugged in. The analog equipment hisses and crackles but these artifacts are no less important than the tunes. If the album has a broader idea to hang itself on, that's it—after listening, you start to notice what your room sounds like. </p></div>"|20034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20034-the-republic/|7.4|Mark Richardson

It's a remarkable development for someone who spent nearly a decade hiding her music from anyone else. Kato originally played in the jaunty folk-pop duo Strrows while still a high school student, spending the back half of the '90s making <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4kLSmmLgCw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">silly twee-pop</a> before inching towards slower material near the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Strrows called it quits in 2001, however, and Kato edged away from sharing her work. She says she spent most of the following nine years writing music by herself, for herself. When she stepped out of the shadows to start performing live again in 2010, the sunny tunes of Strrows were replaced by quieter acoustic numbers titled ""I Know Your Lies"" and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa0MwWuMlTo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I’m Still Alive""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Faintly Lit—</i>technically her debut full-length as her 2012 collection <i>Harmless</i> is considered a ""mini-album,"" but definitely her first release available outside Japan—clocks in at 25 minutes, but its eight songs gestated for a long time, and many were among the first Kato played live upon her re-emergence. Their construction is simple, just Kato’s hushed singing and guitar dolloped with a few other instruments. Opener ""I Write Letter"" ends up being one of <i>Faintly Lit</i>’s busiest moments, Kato double tracking her voice and adding a layer of electronic organ to create a dreamy atmosphere, but it still comes across like someone singing a breath away from your ear.</p>
<p>Kato constructs her songs like short stories and sings them in English that doesn’t waste time on anything complicated. This approach has its downsides, including a groan-worthy campfire sing-along (""Have Fun"") and songs that meander (""Your River"", the longest inclusion at four-and-a-half minutes). On much of the record, though, this lyrical directness coupled with the austere setting creates a convincing downtrodden mood, a feeling not so much sad as resigned.</p>
<p>Yet the best moments on <i>Faintly Lit</i> come when Kato’s words reveal small details that belie the simplicity of her music. ""Life Is Warm"" sounds like a blissful lazy-afternoon love song, scored with xylophone plonks, but then Kato mentions ""your girlfriend,"" and later drops something about ""her boyfriend,"" complicating the innocent scenario. Kato plays this little trick a lot: On the dreamy, nostalgic loser ""Ferris Wheel"", she sings ""Please don’t think of your girlfriend/ I’ll try to control my wicked emotion."" As simple as Kato can sound, she sneaks emotional complexity into her creations.</p>
<p>Even though Kato occasionally lets <i>Faintly Lit</i> get a little too straightforward or allows the songs to run a touch longer than they should, her first proper album mostly features stark songs hiding a lot of craftsmanship, shaped over many years. It helps a lot that it finishes up in under 30 minutes—Kato’s world is entrancing, but also a little too intimate for extended stays.</p></div>"|20105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20105-faintly-lit/|6.7|Patrick St. Michel

But even as the record reinforces his reputation as one of techno's most determined purists, it also suggests that his talents are more varied than perhaps anyone has given him credit for.</p>
<p>Vincent, a New Yorker now based in Berlin, has been making records since the early 2000s, but only in the past six or seven years has become a key figure in the underground. He's a bit like techno's own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a>: He has mentored up-and-coming artists, supporting them out of his own pocket, and he uploads vinyl rips of his own releases to SoulSeek. (In fact, the day before this album was to hit shops, he gave it away via WeTransfer.) His records, mostly self-released on his own <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/124126-Novel-Sound"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Novel Sound</a> label, may sell in modest numbers, perhaps a few thousand copies apiece, but sales are only a small part of the story. On YouTube, some of his tracks and DJ sets have been played hundreds of thousands of times. Those numbers might be surprising, even to his fans, given the monochromatic rigor of his music, its single-mindedness. His productions are radically austere and unusually somber—the color of an overcast sky, or a bruise.</p>
<p>That hasn't changed, exactly. The music on his debut album is moody and, sometimes, a little counterintuitive. It's not necessarily trying to be <i>difficult</i>, but it's intractable out of habit. Drums are scarce, for one thing, at least for a techno record: The four-to-the-floor kick is omnipresent, but for long stretches, the merest hint of washed-out hi-hat is the only percussive element audible. Swathed in murk, these skeletal sounds give the impression of stone rubbings, or a metal frame showing through where paint has been worn away. ""Phantom Power"" goes even further and does away with the low end entirely; for more than five minutes, it is as though the bass EQ has been turned all the way down, leaving tentative synthesizer figures tumbling weightlessly in midair. Which only accentuates the pile-driving wallops of the following track, ""Junkies on Hermann Strasse"", a classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"">Basic Channel</a>-style clanger as physical and pliable as sheet metal. ""Junkies"" eventually dissolves into a cacophonous delay chain as contorted as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31808-cabaret-voltaire/"">Cabaret Voltaire</a>'s early tape works, but not everything on the album is so relentless or so ugly. ""For Mona, My Beloved Cat, Rest in Peace"" is every bit as sentimental as the title promises; this time there is no kick drum, just hi-hats mapping infinity across a glowing swirl of keyboards and mallet instruments, part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a> and part <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Bridge_(pets)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rainbow Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>There's plenty of ""proper"" techno to be found here; ""Anti-Corporate Music"" comes closest to the dubby style of Vincent's singles, with its brushed stainless steel textures and its deeper-than-deep sub-bass. (The title offers a glimpse of the politics implicit in Vincent's DIY project. ""This is music for the ugly ducklings of the world,"" he wrote in a Facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=870143216360559&amp;id=184486851592869"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">post</a> announcing the LP. ""If you're a member of the rat race…you may of course listen, but know—this is not music for you. This is action against you."") But nothing on <i>Levon Vincent</i> is merely functional, and some of the best cuts jam a crowbar into club-music convention. For its first seven minutes, the side-long ""Launch Ramp to tha Sky"" unrolls relatively smoothly, just a lively, vibraphone-like lead over swinging cymbals and chilly reverb. Without warning, the beat falls away and is replaced by slack organ riffing, and that, in turn, gives way to a chromatic freakout laced with angel choir. Piling nightly-news themes atop dial-tone fugue, this coda to the coda is as unabashedly prog as a gatefold LP sticky with weed resin; give a medal to the DJ who manages to play the whole side to a dancefloor and get away with it.</p>
<p>Thanks to its pared-down gear list and capricious flow, <i>Levon Vincent</i> feels like the work of someone left alone in the studio, sketching in real time with what's at hand and moving on. And that spontaneity gives it an even greater sense of intimacy. My favorite track, ""Black Arm w/ Wolf"", is, in many ways, the most melodic, with a stately bassline and contrapuntal melody that could lodge in your head for days. The tune is daubed on in broad strokes, left to drift free of the beat—a sure sign that it was played by hand and not drawn across a grid in the browser window. Throughout it all, Vincent keeps his hand on the knob that controls the cymbals' pitch, and they rise and fall like swallows at dusk. It's freedom rendered four bars at a time—a snapshot of utopia that's made with dancefloors in mind, but not limited to them. </p></div>"|20276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20276-levon-vincent/|8.3|Philip Sherburne

The second album from the metallic Brooklyn instrumental trio Sannhet lasts only nine tracks, or 38 minutes. But its overall density—of emotions and dynamics, of textures and melodies, of strengths and surprises—makes each moment so compelling that the record seems at least twice that length. The album’s brilliant centerpiece, ""Empty Harbor"", rises from a slow, electrified fusion that suggests <a href=""http://www.ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/ECM/1300/1327.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ECM in the '80s </a>to a blast beat-backed surge powerful enough to match the best codas of <a href=""http://shop.temporaryresidence.com/trr201"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temporary Residence Ltd</a>. Driven by masterful drummer Christopher Todd, it sounds like a little symphony, both in execution and effect; looking at the clock, however, it’s shocking to find that the song lasts for less than five minutes.</p>
<p>Sannhet have always defied quick taxonomy. They are a byproduct of Brooklyn’s emergent metal scene;<a href=""http://www.saintvitusbar.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Saint Vitus</a>, one of the city’s heavy hubs, issued their 2013 debut LP, <i>Known Flood</i>, which featured a tirade of screams from bar booker David Castillo. Although their new home, <a href=""http://theflenser.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Flenser</a>, is an aggressively eclectic imprint, the core of its catalog remains metal, however soft or mercurial. From the pummeling black-metal drums during the exhilarating climax of ""Lost Crown"" to the tense rhythmic lock of death metal near the middle of ""False Pass"", traces of that pedigree populate <i>Revisionist</i>. But AJ Annunziata’s bass distortion during songs like ""Enemy Victorian"" implies the astral ascendance of space-rock. The same goes for John Refano, a guitarist who likes to widen the band’s sound with layers of background noise perhaps more than he prefers to lead with coiled riffs. There are astutely applied electronics that suggest the abstraction of <a href=""http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Touch Music</a> masters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2178-philip-jeck/"">Philip Jeck</a>, and careful but brief drone passages that conjure <a href=""http://www.kranky.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kranky</a>. If metal made for the most convenient tag for <i>Known Flood</i>, it is at best an awkward fit for <i>Revisionist</i>, a record that revels and delights in a trove of outsider influences.      </p>
<p>American post-rock and post-metal have often offered the scores of wide-open spaces, be they the football fields and Texas hills of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34p4D6tB9oo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Explosions in the Sky’s <i>Friday Night Lights </i>accompaniment </a>or the rivers and valleys of their <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=balmorhea+all+is+wild+all+is+silent&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fellow Lone Star residents Balmorhea.</a> Labradford, Red Sparowes and ISIS suggested settings more vast and hospitable than the cities they called home. But Sannhet take many of those same sweeping, cinematic impulses and apply them to cramped urban landscapes and lifestyles. They begin ""Mint Divine"" with a sample of voices, which blur into the mind-numbing chatter endemic to busy city streets. The band works to overcome the pervasive din, or to at least carve out a sheltered space within it. Refano and Annunziata deliver a delicate duet, their gentle guitar notes and pulsing bass competing with the hubbub. The voices waft into the next track, ""False Pass"", but Todd battles them back with his heavy hands and deep, floor-tom thuds. Together, Sannhet finally overpower their environment, finding solace in the solidarity of volume.</p>
<p>This metropolitan sense of setting also explains Sannhet’s concision. Only ""Enemy Victorian"", the album’s one listless point, breaks the six-minute mark. Otherwise, Sannhet push the parts together, moving at a rate that suggests they’re worried the city will swallow them if they don’t press ahead. ""You Thy_"" collapses feelings of romance, terror and longing into four breathless minutes, maximizing emotional impact and efficiency all at once. By oscillating between lumbering, loping patterns and sustained blast beats, Todd turns the three-minute ""Lost Crown"" into a frantic, crazed quest in an unsympathetic environment, where no one else cares if you ever recover your holy grail. <span>Sannhet make music for subway stations and unlit street corners, not winding hikes and idyllic vistas.</span></p>
<p>If Explosions in the Sky and similar bands create accompaniment for Hollywood productions, Sannhet offer a vivid, real-life counterpoint. There’s no lighting, no scripting, no catering—just the exigencies and anxieties of existence, delivered by a band battling pedestrian frustrations with uncommon focus. <i>Revisionist</i>, turns out, is bigger than its 38 minutes or the trio that made it; these nine songs are as big as whatever life it is they soundtrack.</p></div>"|20098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20098-revisionist/|8.1|Grayson Haver Currin

Classic-rock radio doesn’t honor veteran bands’ legacies; it contracts and distorts them, reducing diverse multi-decade careers to one or two focus tracks. And because of this, a lot of people have been raised to believe that Thin Lizzy were a hard-rock band, thanks to the only <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ham6vFy8v2I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFFHSRLl3mY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">songs</a> of theirs you’ve been liable to hear on a North American terrestrial rock station over the past 30 years. But as the missing link between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8648-van-morrison/"">Van Morrison</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6895-van-halen/"">Van Halen</a>, the Irish outfit were really a sensitive soul band who rocked hard as a defense mechanism, shielding the late Phil Lynott’s sad-eyed, streetwise narratives in a molten, harmonic twin-guitar attack that anticipated heavy metal without ever fully hardening into it. And while Lizzy’s <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/thumb/0/0e/Thin_Lizzy_Logo.svg/656px-Thin_Lizzy_Logo.svg.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sharp-angled logo</a> fit in right next to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2307-kiss/"">KISS</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22438-acdc/"">AC/DC</a> patches on your older brother’s denim jacket, Lynott was the rare arena-rocker who wasn’t shrieking to hit the cheap seats—he was singing about the sort of poor bastards stuck in them.</p>
<p>That underdog mentality has made Thin Lizzy perhaps the only band of chest-baring, leather-panted '70s rockers to be unironically embraced in the more humble environs of indie rock, having been <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuKuw71YBbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">namedropped in song</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"">the Hold Steady</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIS08_DFmP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"">the Mountain Goats</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTZzo40PUg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lovingly imitated</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2456-ted-leo-and-the-pharmacists/"">Ted Leo</a>. And the band’s eclectic palette of formative influences, not to mention their unique socio-political dynamic (with a half-black frontman, and members from both sides of Ireland’s Catholic/Protestant divide) go a long way in explaining why their early Decca Records catalogue is currently being reissued on vinyl by the astute historical preservationists at <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light In the Attic</a>, as opposed to some major-label bargain-bin CD run.</p>
<p>Like Thin Lizzy's 1971 debut (reissued by LITA in 2012), <i>Shades of a Blue Orphange</i> (1972) and <i>Vagabonds of the Western World </i>(1973) have been ignored by classic-rock radio playlists, and their existence is rarely acknowledged even by the band’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_Lizzy_discography#Compilation_albums"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infinite stream</a> of compilations and live albums. The Thin Lizzy represented here—the early trio formation of Lynott, drummer Brian Downey, and ex-Them guitarist Eric Bell—found themselves in the same position as many other blues-schooled rock bands at the dawn of the post-hippie '70s: aesthetically confused and willing to try anything in hope something would stick (all while <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky7YtxiMhp8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">surreptitiously recording entire albums of Deep Purple covers</a> to pay the bills). And while neither of these albums is wholly rewarding enough to qualify as an overlooked classic, they’re still illuminating documents of a hard-luck band finding its voice for the first time, if only in fits and starts.</p>
<p>As <i>Shades of a Blue Orphanage</i> makes abundantly clear from the get-go, Thin Lizzy weren’t lacking ambition at this stage, but rather direction: Album opener ""The Rise and Dear Demise of the Funky Nomadic Tribes"" is every bit as ridiculous and unwieldy as its title suggests, cycling through tough funk grooves, proto-metal riffage, and progged-out breakdowns en route to a drum solo that fades out unceremoniously at the seven-minute mark. But the track is also something of a red herring, an early, clumsy stab at heaviosity from a band that, at this point, had a much better grasp of intimacy. Even though Thin Lizzy’s sound had yet to settle into place—variously taking the form of ersatz Elvis exercises (""I Don’t Want to Forget How to Drive""), pavement-splitting rockers (""Call the Police""), <i>Astral Weeks</i>-esque folk reveries (""Chatting Today"") and ethereal piano lullabies (""Sarah"")—Lynott’s lyrical voice was already providing a sturdy anchor to rally it around. On richly detailed character studies like ""Buffalo Gal"" and the hymn-like title track, the then-23-year-old Lynott was already singing with the rueful wisdom of a man several decades his senior, laying the foundation for the rugged-romantic archetype that would define his legend.</p>
<p>While <i>Shades of a Blue Orphanage</i> did little to reverse the band’s flagging fortunes, its follow-up single—a glammed-up cover of the traditional Irish standard ""Whiskey in the Jar""—gave Thin Lizzy its first UK hit single in 1972. But that success would not boost the commercial prospects of the band’s next full-length, <i>Vagabonds of the Western World</i>. Fearing that ""Whiskey"" was a novelty hit that didn’t truly reflect the band’s sound, Thin Lizzy refused to include the song on the record. Which is kind of funny in retrospect, since the great breakthrough Thin Lizzy made on ""Whiskey""—in the form of Bell’s thick, mercurial guitar hook—provided them<i> </i>with a new sonic blueprint. </p>
<p>Thin Lizzy had yet to divest itself of all its hare-brained ideas—the spoken-word, psych-funk workout ""The Hero and the Madmen"" may fancy itself a western-themed storybook epic, but it sure as hell ain’t no <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9f_HHV5Pc4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cowboy Song""</a>. They were, however, starting to kick out the jams with greater confidence and consistency. When Lynott shouts ""I’m a rocker!"", it’s no mere crotch-grabbing macho posturing; it’s the sound of a spiritually adrift musician ecstatically discovering his true calling. (Accordingly, the song in question, ""Rocker"", was the one tune from this era to keep its place on the band’s set lists long enough to warrant inclusion on the band’s definitive 1978 concert document, <i>Live and Dangerous</i>.) And though Bell would depart soon after the album’s release, his sweet, swirling leads on the swinging opener ""Mama Nature Said"", the gorgeous soul serenade ""Little Girl in Bloom"", and the storming title track laid down the gasoline trail that Lizzy’s future dream-team tandem of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham would set ablaze. Respectively, the best songs on <i>Shades of a Blue Orphanage</i> and <i>Vagabonds of the Western World</i> displayed the early, indecisive Thin Lizzy's facility with wobbly barstool ballads and swaggering, hot-wired rockers. Their greatest victories would come once they started hitting both targets at the same time.</p></div>"|20262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20262-shades-of-a-blue-orphanagevagabonds-of-the-western-world/|6.3|Stuart Berman

<p>That underdog mentality has made Thin Lizzy perhaps the only band of chest-baring, leather-panted '70s rockers to be unironically embraced in the more humble environs of indie rock, having been <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuKuw71YBbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">namedropped in song</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"">the Hold Steady</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIS08_DFmP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"">the Mountain Goats</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTZzo40PUg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lovingly imitated</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2456-ted-leo-and-the-pharmacists/"">Ted Leo</a>. And the band’s eclectic palette of formative influences, not to mention their unique socio-political dynamic (with a half-black frontman, and members from both sides of Ireland’s Catholic/Protestant divide) go a long way in explaining why their early Decca Records catalogue is currently being reissued on vinyl by the astute historical preservationists at <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light In the Attic</a>, as opposed to some major-label bargain-bin CD run.</p>
<p>Like Thin Lizzy's 1971 debut (reissued by LITA in 2012), <i>Shades of a Blue Orphange</i> (1972) and <i>Vagabonds of the Western World </i>(1973) have been ignored by classic-rock radio playlists, and their existence is rarely acknowledged even by the band’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_Lizzy_discography#Compilation_albums"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infinite stream</a> of compilations and live albums. The Thin Lizzy represented here—the early trio formation of Lynott, drummer Brian Downey, and ex-Them guitarist Eric Bell—found themselves in the same position as many other blues-schooled rock bands at the dawn of the post-hippie '70s: aesthetically confused and willing to try anything in hope something would stick (all while <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky7YtxiMhp8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">surreptitiously recording entire albums of Deep Purple covers</a> to pay the bills). And while neither of these albums is wholly rewarding enough to qualify as an overlooked classic, they’re still illuminating documents of a hard-luck band finding its voice for the first time, if only in fits and starts.</p>
<p>As <i>Shades of a Blue Orphanage</i> makes abundantly clear from the get-go, Thin Lizzy weren’t lacking ambition at this stage, but rather direction: Album opener ""The Rise and Dear Demise of the Funky Nomadic Tribes"" is every bit as ridiculous and unwieldy as its title suggests, cycling through tough funk grooves, proto-metal riffage, and progged-out breakdowns en route to a drum solo that fades out unceremoniously at the seven-minute mark. But the track is also something of a red herring, an early, clumsy stab at heaviosity from a band that, at this point, had a much better grasp of intimacy. Even though Thin Lizzy’s sound had yet to settle into place—variously taking the form of ersatz Elvis exercises (""I Don’t Want to Forget How to Drive""), pavement-splitting rockers (""Call the Police""), <i>Astral Weeks</i>-esque folk reveries (""Chatting Today"") and ethereal piano lullabies (""Sarah"")—Lynott’s lyrical voice was already providing a sturdy anchor to rally it around. On richly detailed character studies like ""Buffalo Gal"" and the hymn-like title track, the then-23-year-old Lynott was already singing with the rueful wisdom of a man several decades his senior, laying the foundation for the rugged-romantic archetype that would define his legend.</p>
<p>While <i>Shades of a Blue Orphanage</i> did little to reverse the band’s flagging fortunes, its follow-up single—a glammed-up cover of the traditional Irish standard ""Whiskey in the Jar""—gave Thin Lizzy its first UK hit single in 1972. But that success would not boost the commercial prospects of the band’s next full-length, <i>Vagabonds of the Western World</i>. Fearing that ""Whiskey"" was a novelty hit that didn’t truly reflect the band’s sound, Thin Lizzy refused to include the song on the record. Which is kind of funny in retrospect, since the great breakthrough Thin Lizzy made on ""Whiskey""—in the form of Bell’s thick, mercurial guitar hook—provided them<i> </i>with a new sonic blueprint. </p>
<p>Thin Lizzy had yet to divest itself of all its hare-brained ideas—the spoken-word, psych-funk workout ""The Hero and the Madmen"" may fancy itself a western-themed storybook epic, but it sure as hell ain’t no <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9f_HHV5Pc4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cowboy Song""</a>. They were, however, starting to kick out the jams with greater confidence and consistency. When Lynott shouts ""I’m a rocker!"", it’s no mere crotch-grabbing macho posturing; it’s the sound of a spiritually adrift musician ecstatically discovering his true calling. (Accordingly, the song in question, ""Rocker"", was the one tune from this era to keep its place on the band’s set lists long enough to warrant inclusion on the band’s definitive 1978 concert document, <i>Live and Dangerous</i>.) And though Bell would depart soon after the album’s release, his sweet, swirling leads on the swinging opener ""Mama Nature Said"", the gorgeous soul serenade ""Little Girl in Bloom"", and the storming title track laid down the gasoline trail that Lizzy’s future dream-team tandem of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham would set ablaze. Respectively, the best songs on <i>Shades of a Blue Orphanage</i> and <i>Vagabonds of the Western World</i> displayed the early, indecisive Thin Lizzy's facility with wobbly barstool ballads and swaggering, hot-wired rockers. Their greatest victories would come once they started hitting both targets at the same time.</p></div>"|20262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20262-shades-of-a-blue-orphanagevagabonds-of-the-western-world/|7.0|Stuart Berman

The follow-up to 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16344-all-of-me/""><i>All of Me</i></a> is a chronicle of love anchored by four themes—""passion, courage, bullshit, and true romance""—though it sticks to this blueprint at the risk of losing some of the idiosyncrasy that gave her previous works character. <i>All of Me</i> and her debut album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11498-shine/"">Shine</a> </i>incorporated many different elements—Estelle experimented with rapping, boom-bap, reggae. Her song with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic5vxw3eijY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""American Boy""</a>, went double platinum before garnering a Grammy for ""Best Rap/Sung"" collaboration. Together, the albums featured beats by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7625-william/"">will.i.am</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5304-mark-ronson/"">Mark Ronson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4630-wyclef-jean/"">Wyclef Jean</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5427-swizz-beatz/"">Swizz Beatz</a>, and guest appearances from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/"">Janelle Monáe</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10706-trey-songz/"">Trey Songz</a>. The patchwork of styles made each album feel scattered and disjointed, but enjoyable.</p>
<p><i>True Romance</i> instead finds Estelle hewing a narrative, singing about passion and healing with the kind of focus and intimacy that all neo-soul ballads require. It’s a decidedly inward-looking album, but as such seems too aspirational for its own good: Estelle narrates her experiences, and hovers so closely to the outline that it feels like we're checking boxes rather than happening upon these themes organically. Spoken word intros break the album up into loose chapters: Estelle says the word ""passion"" and we hear a song about romantic ardor (""Something Good""); she mutters the word ""bullshit"" and we hear a song about a troubled love (""The Same"")—but neither of these songs have the playful immediacy of <i>Shine</i>’s ""American Boy"" or the inchoate longing of <i>All of Me</i>-standout ""Thank You"". There are many feel-good hooks and lilting choruses on <i>True Romance, </i>but the album is so universal in its approach (""We all make mistakes/ You might fall on your face,"" she sings on ""Conqueror"") that it can feel anesthetic. As a result, there’s nothing about <i>True Romance</i> that rings with the feeling of ""passion, courage, bullshit, or true romance."" It’s difficult to make inspirational pop music with personality, and harder still to mold a voice as dynamic as Estelle’s to fit a template—so when the personal stakes don't seem high enough, the message falls flat. </p>
<p>Still, <i>True Romance</i> is less busy than any of Estelle’s previous works, and it shifts the emphasis away from crafty lyricism to vocals and nuanced production. Throughout <i>True Romance</i> Estelle’s voice moves in velvety cascades, ribboning through melismas with muted precision. She adopts a honeyed rasp on ""Time Share"" and coos across a smoky dancehall on ""Not Sure""; she speak-sings through ""She Will Love"" and lowers her range amongst Turkish cymbals on ""Fight For It"". Album standout ""Something Good"", meanwhile, showcases an infectious candor in which Estelle sounds a good deal like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7717-mary-j-blige/"">Mary J. Blige</a>, belting upper-register refrains over a stammering house beat. The step-wise thrum of ""Something Good"" makes me think about the kind of sound Mary J. Blige was striving for in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20050-the-london-sessions/"">her work with Disclosure</a>—and it complements Estelle’s voice enough to make you wish she pursued electronic music further on the rest of the album.</p>
<p>Instead, <i>True Romance</i> is preoccupied with the well-worn territory of soul-pop, and its lyrics about overcoming obstacles and troubled relationships can often sound rote (see: ""Gotcha Love""). For a supposedly introspective record, it feels strikingly sanitary—like a centrifuge of sounds and words that are often <i>associated</i> with romance and self-discovery, without the depth of yearning that leads us to understand why these feelings <i>matter</i>. As an album, it feels complete but transient: <i>True Romance</i> has the capacity to lift and inspire, but that feeling doesn’t linger.</p></div>"|20257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20257-true-romance/|6.9|Molly Beauchemin

Freshly returned from a stint as a Fulbright student in West Berlin, Borden had an open mind toward new ideas in music but knew very little about synthesizers, which were then fairly bulky and esoteric. According to the composer, this made him an ideal test subject for Moog, who allowed Borden to experiment with his prototypes as a way to proof the designs for regular consumers.</p>
<p>Not long after, Borden would found Mother Mallard’s Portable Masterpiece Company, a keyboard trio that performed works by then-emerging composers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15839-robert-ashley/"">Robert Ashley</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>. Very quickly, the trio evolved into an all-synthesizer ensemble, performing original work using a number instruments provided by Moog. </p>
<p>Inspired by composers like Riley, Borden wrote music that edged away from the abstract atonal sounds that dominated electronic music at the time, instead relying on the gestures that would become central to minimalism—simple harmonies, complex rhythmic figures, and repetition. Mother Mallard released two LPs—self-titled and <i>Like a Duck to Water, </i>both on Borden’s Earthquack label—before the group dissolved entirely during the late '70s (though it has since been reactivated).</p>
<p>Originally released in 1981 on Red Records, <i>Music For Amplified Keyboard Instruments </i>collects four of Borden’s post-Mallard compositions. Stylistically speaking, they are a direct continuation of that group's work. Indeed, they even involve the same instruments—the MiniMoog, Moog Modular, and RMI electronic piano—which Borden retained after the band split up. Now remastered and reissued by <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/releases/spectrum-spools/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spectrum Spools</a>, the record still stands as an excellent work of minimalist composition and also an important piece of American electronic music. A number of early Moog oriented records involved shoehorning the instrument into existing repertoire (think ""Switched on Bach"" or ""Switched on Country"") or using it as a spacey aside within the context of prog or psychedelic rock. <i>Music For Amplified Keyboard Instruments </i>is different, and arguably more interesting, in that it involves new work composed specifically for that synthesizer.</p>
<p>At first listen, it’s easy to overlook the role of the Moog in Borden’s compositions. The gestures that often define synthesizer music—filter sweeps, squelchy modulations—are mostly absent from <i>Music For Amplified Keyboard Instruments</i>. In comparison to the work of German synth gurus like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>, the tweak-ability factor is fairly subtle. This was mostly due to Borden's frustrations with performing synthesizer music live. ""After dealing with the many difficulties and variables that occur in live performance situations, especially with early model synthesizers, I developed a style and language of polyphonic music that can be played with simple, easy to set up wave forms,"" wrote Borden in the liner notes to the record's original pressing.</p>
<p>However, many of the compositions are heavily shaped by the capabilities of the synthesizer. The Moog is a monophonic instrument, meaning that only one key can sound at a time, which makes it mechanically impossible to play chords. As a result, much of Borden's work on <i>Music For Amplified Keyboard Instruments</i> relies on interlocking melodies that are performed by three keyboard players, each using two keyboards simultaneously. Together these figures add up to simple but frequently shifting harmonies. And there are convenient workarounds, too. On one piece, for instance, Borden tunes one instrument to a perfect fifth, so that when a single key is pressed, the keyboard produces two simultaneous pitches. The results, particularly on the pieces drawn from Borden's larger work, ""The Complete Story of Counterpoint"", are gorgeous and meditative.</p>
<p>While Borden has not become quite as well recognized as some of his minimalist contemporaries, like Reich or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>, you can hear his influence deeply embedded in the music of recent synthesizer-oriented electronic outfits, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a> (whose former member, John Elliot, runs Spectrum Spools) or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Daniel Lopatin</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"">Laurel Halo</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"">James Ferraro</a>, all of whom collaborated with the composer in the seventh installment of <a href=""http://igetrvng.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RVNG</a>'s collaborative series, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15654-frkwys-vol-7/""><i>FRKWYS</i></a>. Most of these are musicians who perform electronic works in concert.</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that the pieces on <i>Amplified Keyboard Instruments </i>were recorded live. Arpeggiated melodies and chords are central to synthesizer music, whether applied in a Krautrock-style zone-out or club-friendly dance tune. However, those figures are often automated using a sequencer. Borden's compositions on this record and also in Mother Mallard were performed in real time by individuals, and while that made the music challenging to represent accurately, it also allowed for deeper and more intricate harmonic movement, which would have been time-consuming to program into an old-school hardware sequencer. And more than that, it allows for a bit of sloppiness—an un-gridded feel and inherent emotionality that's tough for a computer to crack, even now. </p></div>"|20265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20265-music-for-amplified-keyboard-instruments/|8.0|Aaron Leitko

But if pop listeners come for the songs, they tend to stay for the personalities, and this is the issue facing Purity Ring on <i>another eternity</i>. On their debut, Megan James and Corin Roddick were hard to read and analysis-averse, and they remain so. Their sound remains singular, but is it still <i>interesting</i>?</p>
<p>Staying the course, as they largely do on <i>another eternity</i>, isn’t that risky a proposition for them: The pop world seems right about where <i>Shrines</i> left it<span>. Accordingly, James and Roddick try to close the gap separating their vision of pop from <i>actual</i> pop. The bolder and brighter presentation of<i> another eternity</i> singles ""push pull"" and ""begin again"" gets them awfully close to latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift"">Taylor Swift</a> or Katy Perry; ""repetition"" could’ve popped up on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20271-if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late""><i>If You’re Reading This It's Too Late</i></a> or serve as a backing track for the next <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5996-miley-cyrus/"">Miley Cyrus </a>single, all acts whose 2013-2014 output drew liberally from Purity Ring.</span></p>
<p><span>But if Purity Ring don't have the advantage of novelty anymore, their aesthetic is strong enough that familiarity becomes a decent substitute. Within the first minute of <i>another eternity</i>, the ease of recognizing Purity Ring amongst their still-growing brood of imitators is actually startling. If the lower-case stylization of <i>another eternity</i> and its song titles seems overly precious, at least it’s congruent with James’ distinct vocal approach. She works something like an origami expert, quickly folding and refolding melodies until they’re acutely angled, pointed, and elegant.</span></p>
<p>James’ lyrics explore the same juxtaposition of delicacy and danger, though less so than on <i>Shrines</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9591-purity-ring/"">She promised</a> a more personal, present-tense perspective than her past work, and so her macabre, childlike fascination with bodily functions is applied to more adult situations, like breakups and such. At best, James’ impressionism leaves an imprint on your brain<span>—</span>on ""repetition"", the curious boast ""Watching me is like watching the fire take your eyes from you"" is delivered with enough gusto to hit at a gut level.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">However, by posting the </span><a href=""http://purityringthing.com/lyrics/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lyrics sheet</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> prior to the release of </span><i>another eternity</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, the duo revealed as many ""o’ers"" and leering, stiff turns of phrase as a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists"" target=""_blank"">Decemberists</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> album (""Baby why don’t you see my sea/ Get inside and build your castle into me"").</span> At times, the moony metaphors devolve into Wordsworth Tumblr-jumble, and on ""stillness in woe"", James achieves a sort of Purity Ring singularity with one line: ""Meet me in the back shed/ I’ll be hanging up the knives/ Humming melodies that rhyme/ Building castles out of shovels.""</p>
<p>It's this twee undercurrent that manages to keep Purity Ring nominally ""indie"", and also provides crucial contrast with Roddick’s productions. <span>Roddick wants to remind listeners more of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"" target=""_blank"">Mike WiLL Made It</a><span> and Noah ""40"" Shebib than </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a><span> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a><span> this time,</span> and he makes everything sound more cushy and cavernous, evoking the sensation of sitting on the most comfortable couch in the club after everyone leaves. Throughout, Purity Ring manages to sound big without sounding <i>expensive,</i> forgoing nuance and detail for scalability. Stream it on laptop speakers and you can still picture every dazzling MIDI trigger in a live setting.</p>
<p>James and Roddick altered their process for <i>another eternity</i>, working together in the same studio, and as a result they seem to have gravitated towards the sort of tricks meant to provoke an immediate, contagious enthusiasm from the person standing right next to you. Credit to Purity Ring for being honest with themselves and acknowledging that they’ve spent the past couple of years playing festivals and collaborating with the bigger names in oddball mainstream rap (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tr9jjXqj7w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Angel Haze</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48167-purity-ring-enlist-danny-brown-for-belispeak-sequel-belispeak-ii/"">Danny Brown</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oajnyCVSmiI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ab-Soul</a>). The beats that pop up during the hooks of opening duo ""heartsigh"" and ""bodyache"" are meant for bleacher stomping, while there are legitimate <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Levels""</a>-level drops on ""begin again"". Any sort of indignation feels misplaced<span>—</span>you might as well shake your fist at a rock song for containing a riff. But most of Roddick's ""new"" tricks could’ve ended up on <i>Shrines</i>, whether it's the apparitional, pitched-down vocals, flickering Auto-Tune, warped bass and a fairly brazen nick of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean"">Frank Ocean</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12271-thinking-about-you/"">""Thinkin Bout You""</a> on ""stranger than earth"". As a result, it's difficult to tell when <i>another eternity</i> builds on <i>Shrines</i> and when <i>Shrines </i>is being stripped for parts.</p>
<p> By every objective standard, even the one set by its near-suffocatingly cohesive predecessor, this is a narrow work. Eight of its 1o tracks clock in between 3:15 and 3:40, and its tone, timbre, topicality and flow are pathologically even-keeled; there’s nothing to upset the equilibrium like <i>Shrines</i>' jarring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29342-young-magic/"">Young Magic</a> guest spot <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCCOnKSZ1bY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Grandloves""</a>. Verses and choruses are pretty much equidistant at all times. <span>You can imagine </span><i>another eternity</i><span> as beat-tape like source material, where just about every melody could be extracted for outside hook use.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps we should’ve saw that coming considering the numerous allusions to repetition and new starts in both the album and song titles. But the most worrisome bit of referentiality comes not from Roddick's production or James' melodies, but from a recycling of <i>Shrines</i>’ most powerful image. That one came on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13781-fineshrine"">""Fineshrine""</a>, where James experienced a love so overwhelming and frightening, she asked them to climb inside her rib cage. ""seacastle"" likewise views sexual congress as a supernatural escape plan and on ""repetition"" she echoes the favor from ""Fineshrine""<span>—""</span>Climb up in my rattling spine and I’ll contract."" This obsession with connecting and disappearing in rapid succession is fitting for a record that finds Purity Ring trying to stake their claim at pop's center but ultimately retreating within themselves.</p></div>"|20306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20306-another-eternity/|6.6|Ian Cohen

Tearing off the plastic and firing up my Fisher-Price turntable, I eagerly prepared myself for four sides of Fab Four classics, only to hear... a lot of talking. The double-album set, it turned out, was nothing but a hastily compiled Capitol Records Beatlemania cash-in that edited together various press conferences. For famed Fab Fourologist Noel Gallagher, I can easily imagine a reverse scenario—judging by his post-2000 track record, an album of nothing but his interviews would undoubtedly be way more entertaining than one of proper songs.</p>
<p>Reading a conversation with Noel Gallagher is one of <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/noel-gallaghers-epic-year-end-gripe-session-20131205"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">life’s</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/8688-noel-gallagher/"">great</a> <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1782569/qa-noel-gallagher-on-kanye-paul-beck-beyonce-morrissey-marr-jack-white-black-keys/franchises/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pleasures</a>. He’s quick-witted, unguarded, cheerily self-effacing—pretty much everything that the overly mannered music he’s making these days is not. His second foray with the High Flying Birds ventures further afield than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15944-noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-st/"">his 2011 debut</a>, but still succumbs to the same issues—most notably, a palpable joylessness, and the extra strain that puts on Gallagher’s modest voice and piecemeal lyrics.</p>
<p>Considering its creator’s penchant for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaeLKhRnkhQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">playful plagiarism</a>—not to mention the fact he’s staring down <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19771-oasis-whats-the-story-morning-glory/"">the 20th anniversary of his career best</a>—you’ll find no richer album title this year than <i>Chasing Yesterday</i>. And in that regard, the man doesn’t let us down: The opening <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idcaRTg4-fM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Riverman""</a> alone cops its title from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a>, its acoustic groove from Gallagher’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzrDeceEKc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">biggest hit</a>, its first line from the Beatles’ ""Something"", and its dreamy brass breakdown from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>’s ""Shine On Your Crazy Diamond"". And the second-hand hits keep-a-comin’: ""The Girl With X-Ray Eyes"" puts <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFDj3shXvco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bowie’s raygun to her head</a>; the album’s one true rave-up, ""Lock All the Doors"", finds Gallagher once again <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZucKDddRMSM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chained to the mirror and the razor blade</a>, albeit with a copy of David Essex’s <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liWIbE1gQTk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock On</a></i> on-hand as a back-up snorting surface. (And that’s not even the most <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"">Oasis</a>-y song on here—that one’s called, natch, ""You Know We Can’t Go Back"".)</p>
<p>Sure, itemizing the song quotes in Noel Gallagher songs is a bit like counting all the f-bombs in a Tarantino flick, a futile exercise in <i>duh</i>. But where Oasis once invested their obvious influences with an attitude and swagger undeniably their own, here Gallagher's like the leader of a consummate cocktail-hour cover act, momentarily piquing your interest with the sound of your favorite tune before tastefully receding into the background. Without brutish brother Liam around to personify his most primal emotions, Noel and the Birds can’t do much but maintain a steady cruising altitude, rarely working up the will to truly soar.</p>
<p>Of course, even in Oasis’ mid-'90s glory, Gallagher was never an especially deep songwriter, but his shopworn sentiments at least felt genuinely lived-in and relatable. (And, ultimately, those songs made you feel really good, and you’re willing to forgive a lot when you feel good.) The moody, mid-tempo torpor of <i>Chasing Yesterday</i> only emphasizes the fact that, as Gallagher’s songs have turned more narrative and descriptive in his later years, they’ve become more emotionally vague. Pretty much every tune here sees him pining for some mystical, unattainable woman, but with all the hazy cosmic jive about being ""shot from the sun like a bullet from a gun"" and ""dreaming about a revolution"" and a ""girl who electrifies the storm,"" Gallagher isn’t so much burning his heart out as slipping inside the eye of his mind. And while the bloozy bar-band guitar/sax interplay would be enough to sink ""The Mexican"" on its own, its restraining-order-worthy come-on—""You say you need love/ Just like a kid on crack""—makes it sound like Gallagher tests out his pick-up lines after watching reruns of <i>Cops</i>.</p>
<p>But while the songwriting may be on autopilot, Gallagher’s decision to self-produce <i>Chasing Yesterday</i> was a smart one, resulting in an album that feels both intimate and expansive. Hands-down album highlight ""The Right Stuff"" reminds us that Noel does his best work with a foil—in this case, guest vocalist Joy Rose, whose simmering verses lend Gallagher's mid-song takeover a sense of occasion, while goading saxophonist Jim Hunt into some destabilizing psychedelic squawking. In <a href=""http://news.nationalpost.com/2015/02/25/noel-gallagher-on-the-end-of-oasis-his-brothers-body-hair-and-why-he-would-never-pull-a-kanye/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview for the album</a>, Gallagher ranked ""The Right Stuff"" and the similarly nomadic (if less captivating) ""Riverman"" as among the Top 12 songs he’s written. If this portends further excursions in uncharted terrain, let’s hope it’s the rare interview where Noel Gallagher’s not taking the piss.</p></div>"|20179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20179-chasing-yesterday/|5.9|Stuart Berman

You listen because it’s good for you, is the implication, which is certainly worthwhile as far as that goes. But rarely is this type of retrospective quite as much fun as <i>Lead Belly: The Smithsonian Folkways Collection</i>. It’s not only the first full career retrospective of one of the most significant musicians of the twentieth century. It’s also a blast.</p>
<p>We have an image of Lead Belly as a somber bluesman, a stoic song collector who wore a perpetually solemn expression like that on the cover of the new 5xCD set. That was, of course, only one side of the musician, who memorized and personalized a vast array of American work songs, play songs, Tin Pan Alley hits, spirituals, blues, ballads, reels, hollers, jigs, calls, and more. He was as much a raconteur as he was a songster, and when he has a chance to tell you all about a song—where it came from, how he heard it, why it sounds the way it does, or how it fits into your everyday life—Lead Belly reveals the dynamism of a great storyteller. When he introduces ""Leaving Blues"" during a radio broadcast, Lead Belly declaims the nature of the blues with a preacherly cadence, which turns a sad situation into something almost comical. The story lasts longer than the actual song: For him talk is not just crucial to the music, but a kind of music in and of itself.</p>
<p>""Fun"" is not the first word applied to Huddie ""Lead Belly"" Ledbetter because certain aspects of his life were inflated in the 1930s and '40s and have yet to deflate. He did serve prison sentences for manslaughter—at Imperial State Prison Farm in Texas and Angola in Louisiana, both notoriously brutal institutions—and he managed to sing his way out of them. When he moved to New York City, the press played up his past at the expense of his music; the <i>New York Herald</i> previewed an early performance with the sensationalist headline, ""Sweet Singer of the Swamplands Here to Do a Few Tunes Between Homicides"". As archivist and curator Jeff Place points out in the liner notes here, it was an all too common attitude at the time.</p>
<p>Over the course of his relatively short 15-year recording career, Lead Belly met many sympathetic label executives, producers, and fellow musicians who promoted him as a dynamic entertainer and an accomplished songster, but he never truly escaped the condescending ""noble savage"" stigma attached to him by the liberal elite of the Northeast. Nor did he achieve much popular success during his lifetime. He sold primarily to a small community of folk fans in and around New York, but never made a considerable impact beyond the city. In that regard, he was a man slightly out of time. It was just a few years after his death in 1949 when folk became big business, when the songs he had preserved became mainstays in coffeehouses and concert halls. Without Lead Belly, the folk revival of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Dylan</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17325-joan-baez/"">Baez</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12679-fred-neil/"">Fred Neil</a> would have been very different, and it might not have happened at all.</p>
<p>Lead Belly also left his mark on rock'n'roll. What’s remarkable about this collection is just how familiar many of these songs already are. ""Black Girl (Where Did You Sleep Last Night)"" is perhaps best known to many via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>’s 1993 <i>Unplugged</i> performance, but there’s also ""The Midnight Special"" (a hit for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8318-creedence-clearwater-revival/"">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>, among others) and ""Black Betty"" (Ram Jam, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2210-tom-jones/"">Tom Jones</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2205-the-jon-spencer-blues-explosion/"">Jon Spencer Blues Explosion</a>). ""Pick a Bale of Cotton"" and ""Rock Island Line"" formed the foundation of the UK skiffle movement in the 1950s, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin</a> more or less stole ""The Gallis Pole"" riff, lyrics, and all. Lead Belly didn’t write all of these songs, but he collected them from a variety of sources—other cotton pickers in Texas, other inmates, other musicians, family members, friends—and put his indelible stamp on them. Most subsequent artists discovered these songs through his versions.</p>
<p>The first three discs of <i>The Smithsonian Folkways Collection </i>are as fine a retrospective as you can find for Lead Belly, showcasing the diversity of his repertoire and the precision of his playing and singing. (For those who don’t have the $100 for this box set, many of these tracks were compiled on Smithsonian Folkways’ <i><a href=""http://www.folkways.si.edu/lead-belly/where-did-you-sleep-last-night-legacy-vol-1/african-american-music-folk-blues/album/smithsonian"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lead Belly Legacy series</a></i>, any of which makes a fine entry point into his vast catalog.) What distinguishes this collection is its scope: There have been hundreds of Lead Belly comps released over the last half-century, but too few put his best-known material alongside his radio performances and final sessions, which are included on the fourth and fifth discs. Recorded during the 1940s for a folk series on WNYC, his radio broadcasts show him in a looser setting where the distinctions between his patter and his playing seem to disappear. Whether he’s singing solo or accompanied by the Oleander Quartet, he’s an outsize personality on the airwaves, especially during the two 15-minute programs that allow him to regale his imagined, invisible audience with stories as well as songs.</p>
<p>The final disc includes songs from what would be Lead Belly’s last sessions in 1948. His voice sounds noticeably weaker, with an uneasy grain in his syllables that has less to do with age and more to do with the onset of ALS. He’d be dead in a year, but as shaky as his voice may be, it is no less certain in its phrasing, whether he’s rhapsodizing with a Bessie Smith record on ""Nobody Knows You When You’re Down and Out"" or singing ""Stewball"" accompanied only by backing vocals and handclaps. It’s tempting to read anything called ""Last Sessions"" as poignant, but Lead Belly brings a very familiar exuberance to ""It’s Tight Like That"" and ""House of the Rising Son"".</p>
<p>It’s fitting that the final track on <i>The Smithsonian Folkways Collection</i> isn’t a song, but a brief monologue called ""In the World"", based on a half-remembered conversation from long ago. It makes for a fitting epilogue to this monumental box set, primarily because it reveals Lead Belly’s role as an archivist of American music, passing tunes and ideas along from one person to the next, from one generation to the next. ""We all gotta get peace together because we’re in the world together,"" he muses. ""I never heard nothing like it. Now you got it now.""</p></div>"|20200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20200-lead-belly-the-smithsonian-folkways-collection/|9.0|Stephen M. Deusner

And it’s a rather fortuitous coincidence that the band’s scabrous sophomore album, <i>Wool Sucking</i>, should drop at the same time that Kim Gordon’s <i>Girl in a Band</i> hit shelves to re-stoking interest in the early '80s East Coast avant-punk scene to which EULA pledge spiritual allegiance. But just as New York is a vastly different place than it was 30 years ago, EULA put a friendly face on an aesthetic synonymous with self-loathing nihilism. They may be trudging through the same sewers as their forbears, but they’re greatful for the sunlight poking through the grates.</p>
<p><i>Wool Sucking</i> is, in essence, an album of love songs, though Lamb isn’t so much interested in communicating passion as transmitting what it does to you physiologically—the destabilizing sense of vulnerability, the sweaty-palmed nervousness, the heart-racing agitation. This is an album where every come-on doubles as a grave warning (""I collapse into you/ Be careful what you do… can you handle nasty weather?""), where caring too much leads to cardiac arrest (""My heart needs an orderly/ To keep it from exploding""), where innocence blurs into innuendo (""I could love you/ Like a mother""). Lamb was a ballet kid, and you can sense that appreciation for theatricality in her acrobatic, acquired-taste vocals, which allow her to harmonize and play call-and-response with herself as if trying to give all the competing voices in her head an equal say. The music behind her is equally excitable and unsettled, a roiling tempest of blues-battered scuzz (""Meadows"" revs up like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14275-the-allman-brothers/"">Allmans</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCtdKWWfZG8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Whipping Post""</a> relocated to an S&amp;M dungeon), doomsday basslines, and fractious drum patterns that imagines where the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> might be today if they never returned Interscope’s phone calls.</p>
<p>At times, EULA’s impulsive energy can manifest into ineffectual thrashing (see: ""Aplomb""), but, in light of their more scattered 2011 debut, <i>Maurice Narcisse</i>—which absorbed influences from disco to cow-punk—<i>Wool Sucking</i> wisely focuses on what the band do best: writhing rockers and disquieting, oddly affecting ballads. In the latter mode, not only do EULA project a surprising emotional depth, but—through the deceptively calm pastorales of ""The Destroyer"" and “Monument”—also liberate themselves from the New York skronk-punk tradition to which they’re so often tied. And the quieter presentation only amplifies the symbiotic relationship between desire and destruction that forms the core of this album. When Lamb sings, ""I will take your beat/ If you will take my heart"" on the chilling, dying-embered torch song ""Your Beat"", you’re not sure if she's exchanging wedding vows or forging a suicide pact.</p></div>"|20264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20264-wool-sucking/|7.2|Stuart Berman

Envied by their peers—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31405-krill/"">Krill</a> snuck a song about listening to Pile, awestruck, <a href=""http://wheretheresakrilltheresaway.bandcamp.com/album/steve-hears-pile-in-malden-and-bursts-into-tears"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on a 2014 EP</a>—and idolized by a growing army of diehards, they are the overwhelming consensus pick in the Massachussetts indie scene for the next to blow. All of which may come as some surprise to Rick Maguire, Pile's delightfully self-effacing frontman. A few lines into ""The World Is Your Motel""—leadoff track from the Boston rippers' third LP, <i>You're Better Than This</i>—Maguire's already given up on King-dom: ""I'll never be Elvis, I guess—one big, moist bag of garbage."" So <i>this </i>is the Pile your cousin at MassArt's been raving about: <span>the kind of band who'd take a startlingly gorgeous instrumental and give it a name like ""Fuck the Police,</span>"" or reserve what just might be <i>You're Better</i>'s tenderest moment for a half-remembered dream about ""customer servicing"" Maguire's second-grade teacher.<br/><br/>The knotty, hermetic <i>You're Better</i> is, above all else, a profoundly skittish record, prone to sudden outbursts and wild mood swings. The music on <i>You're Better</i> is gnarly and volatile: Even in its tenderest moments, you can sense the encroaching dread. Pile's clotted, cacophonous, turn-on-a-dime constructions—and their aversion to 4/4 rhythms—lends <i>You're Better</i> a nervy, dander-up feel; even the songs you swear you know by heart seem to break off into wild tangents at a moment's notice. But Pile aren't simply thrashing for its own sake here; they're seeking to discombobulate. So, while, elegant they ain't, all these odd angles and left-field interjections are, in fact, precision attacks, laboriously plotted flare-ups meant to mirror the buzz and howl inside Maguire's head.</p>
<p>So what's Maguire been losing sleep over these days? Well, there's the little stuff, like his utter helplessness with paperwork, or his résumé, which even he'll admit, ""while less than impressive, is consistent."" And then there's the bigger issues: the anxiety, the specter of the past lingering over his every move. Maguire has a gift for rendering these emotional states in physical terms: On ""Yellow Room"", for instance, he recalls a moment in which his ""heart turned into a fist when my body can't move."" ""Hot Breath"" is written entirely on the body, a laundry list of physical stress responses. Elsewhere, there are ""secrets in a vault that eat your insides like acid,"" or Maguire waiting ""as patiently as [he] can for [his] heart to ache again."" This cross-wiring of mental anguish with physical distress mirrors the fitful structure of <i>You're Better</i>. Maguire's not one to let these cognitive wrinkles go un-ironed; he really wants to get <i>in</i> there, to dig in deep, and the music crackles and explodes alongside Maguire's over-firing neurons.<br/><br/>Spending 37 minutes with Maguire while he catalogs his—and, by extension, your—indiscretions might sound like a slog, but Maguire makes for awfully good company. For one, he's onto himself; on ""Appendicitis"", which follows a good half-hour of bloodletting, Maguire likens his troubles to an ""inflatable cross,"" something he carries around to make himself seem more interesting. That, and he's just weird as hell; on ""Tin Foil Hat"", he likens himself to both a plumber and physicist. And, <i>You're Better</i>, in the end, is a curiously heartening record. Maguire's not big on pointing fingers or casting aspersions; his problems, he'd be the first to admit, are largely of his own making. It's a feeling we all know too well: dead awake at 3 AM, obsessing over something we should've done or shouldn't have said. By delving deep into these loneliest of moments, Maguire's essentially saying ""hey, I do all this dumb shit, too,"" and there's a strange sort of comfort in that.<br/><br/>As buzzy new albums from indie rock up-and-comers go, it's a particularly uneasy listen. While the cloistered, overdub-averse production of <i>You're Better</i> lends the proceedings a certain urgency, it occasionally comes at the cost of clarity. Maguire's got no shortage of material, but his words often get swallowed up in a mess of his own making, which makes finding your way through <i>You're Better</i> something of a fool's errand, and leaves certain stretches of the record feeling just a hair closed-in, if not closed off. You've really got to fight to make your way into <i>You're Better Than This</i>, to carve out a little room amidst its unstable rhythms, its twining guitars, and Maguire's screams-of-consciousness. But that's precisely what inspires such devotion in Pile's growing cohort: They're not interested in being something to everyone when they can be everything to someone.</p></div>"|20209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20209-youre-better-than-this/|7.4|Paul Thompson

Keef was being sentenced to rehab, and the TMZ drone flung questions at him in his employer’s house style (lightly mocking, difficult to ignore), about his drug use, his fast driving, his habit of carrying too much cash around. Was he planning to change? Flashing a smile that seems charitable to spare for a paparazzo, Keef responded simply (and unforgettably): ""I growed up. I <i>glowed</i> up.""</p>
<p>He repeats this ear-sticking phrase, ""glowed up"", on the first track of his latest mixtape,<i> Sorry 4 the Weight</i>. Dropped last week with a title punning on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20186-sorry-4-the-wait-2/"">Lil Wayne’s recent release</a>, the tape feels like an emergence, in a way, from Keef’s wilderness period. After Interscope released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17477-finally-rich/""><i>Finally Rich</i></a>, the Chicago rapper underwent serious, uh, glowing pains, during which his already-dark music took a surreal, infernal turn. He uploaded songs to his SoundCloud, like <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/chiefkeef/chief-keef-wait"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wait""</a>,  that felt too weird to include on any official releases. He taught himself to produce. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20027-chief-keef-gucci-mane-back-from-the-dead-2big-gucci-sosa/""><i>Back From the Dead 2</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20087-nobody/""><i>Nobody</i></a>, he drowned his voice in processing like someone bent on murdering their personality through technology. It was a fascinating reinvention, forged away from the glare of major labels, in the soup of YouTube and Audiomack plays. It was occasionally indistinguishable from flailing. On <i>Sorry 4 the Weight</i>, he emerges as something new: A calm, poised, self-sufficient auteur, a production machine of Keef Music.</p>
<p>The tracks on <i>Sorry 4 the Weigh</i>t are credited to simply GGP, or Glo Gang Productions. Individual names are subsumed into the collective, but members include Hurtboy AG, 12 Hunna, DP Beats, and Keef himself. The vagueness of authorship may be intentional, a way of retaining ownership over a house sound. And that sound has settled into something that feels both formally fixed and malleable, a sort of sonic Silly Putty that can be stretched and stamped in any direction. The basic stuff of the sound comes from tinny MIDI patches arguing with each other in squiggly bursts, while drums boom and rattle. The sounds all line up along the same plane, so it all reaches your ear in a trebly tangle of mid-frequencies. It’s both busy and dinky, a hard chunk of sound that separates into a writhing pile of earworms when poked.</p>
<p>Congas and bongos, clattering busily around the edges of the music, are the most noticeable new addition on <i>Sorry 4 the Weight</i>. On ""What Up"", produced by Keef himself, circular bongos pulse against a snare roll, and Keef weaves a third pattern in between them, so that there are at least six different permutations of rhythms to nod your head to. This is where the sneaky complexity of Keef’s music comes in: He’s a formal innovator, one who finds lots of ways for his muttering vocals to mesh with the contrary moving lines of his music. His cadences have strange emphases everywhere, and the effect is similar to hearing someone clumping around a floor above you wearing a full leg cast. He breaks words up over bars, so that words like ""money"" get rendered as two molten lumps, ""mah"" and ""nah"", strewn across different beats.</p>
<p>These sorts of decisions are often what keep skeptical rap fans at an arm’s length from Keef, but <i>Sorry 4 the Weight</i> is the least abstracted thing he’s released in a long while. His voice is mixed higher and clearer; there is less AutoTune applied to his voice, fewer glottal non-verbal performances. He raps, for bars and bars at a time, in a way that he hasn’t seemed interested in for awhile, and in a way that rap fans who feel reflexively derisive about him probably aren't used to. He has a gift for writing hooks that contain enough jokes, thoughts, and phrases in them that they feel like they could be the whole song, a talent that you can trace back directly to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"">Gucci Mane</a>, and indirectly to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"">50 Cent</a> before that, who Keef idolizes and namechecks again on an interlude on <i>Sorry</i>.</p>
<p>There are still fleeting moments of the nightmarish, sinking-tarpit sound of his wildest work: On ""W.W.Y.D."", over clotted-up synths, Keef’s voice moves like headlights in fog, and his words break down into outbreaks of ""Skoot-doo-do"". It’s still thrilling to hear, and it makes one wish that wasn’t such a clean partition set between Keef’s verses and his flirtations with the digital void. The loneliness and poetry of ""Nobody"", say, in which Keef’s wandering, bluesy vocal take may as well be a wah-wah guitar solo for all you can make out of it, is missing. <i>Sorry 4 the Weight</i> is more settled-sounding,  a ""grown"" record from an artist who seems grimly determined to move forward at all costs. ""If I'm in my mansion, every day all day, best believe I'm working on something...That's all I need to be happy. Work, work, work myself,"" he says on the intro to ""Ten Toes Down"". Maybe once he feels safe in his mansion again, he can invite the chaos back into his studio. </p></div>"|20281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20281-sorry-4-the-weight/|7.1|Jayson Greene

But there’s another big reason why veteran alt-rock acts who were playing clubs 20 years ago—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">the Flaming Lips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a>—now find themselves headlining festivals: jam-band fans. Relentlessly loyal to artists and financially secure enough to follow them across the country, jam-band heads are the unsung benefactors helping to keep the enterprise afloat. And if ever there was a band that should capitalize on this crossover, it’s Parquet Courts. Like their patron saint Stephen Malkmus—who could see the proverbial weed cloud looming on the horizon when he titled a song on the last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> album <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWLeNZQOOQ0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Folk Jam""</a>—Parquet Courts’ sarcastic verbosity can’t fully conceal their latent desire to lock into a groove, zone out, and coast on that perfect sound forever. And in terms of appealing to jam-band enthusiasts—well, what demographic can better relate to a song like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5P1SzaJ3jk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stoned and Starving""</a>?</p>
<p>Alas, that standout from Parquet Courts’ 2012 breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17405-light-up-gold/""><i>Light Up Gold</i></a> is nowhere to be found on the band’s new live album. But in lieu of such readymade 420 clarion calls, Parquet Courts assert their jam-band bona fides the old fashioned way: by stretching four-minute songs into 10-minute songs. Cut last June at <a href=""http://thirdmanrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Third Man</a>’s intimate Blue Room venue-cum-recording studio, <i>Live at Third Man Records</i> is essentially Parquet Court’s 2014 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19403-parquet-courts-sunbathing-animal/""><i>Sunbathing Animal</i></a> (of its 11 tracks, this release features 10 songs from that record) if it were left to scorch in the desert a little longer. </p>
<p>Listening to<i> </i>this album, I’m reminded of <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/life-to-the-pixies/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an old legend about the Pixies</a> playing select concerts backwards—i.e., opening the concert with the encore, leaving the stage, and then returning to play their proper set in reverse order. Because in this context, the blitzkrieged banter of ""Duckin &amp; Dodgin"" sounds less like an introduction than the sort of delirious high point a band hits two hours into a marathon set, when they’re running on nothing but adrenaline. Following that, it’s actually something of a miracle that singer/guitarist Andrew Savage has anything left for the rest of the show, but his increasingly hoarse hectoring actually serves to streamline <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>’s grab-bag selections, investing the proto-punk shimmy of ""Black &amp; White"" and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">Minutemen</a>-esque oddity ""Vienna II"" with the same brutish urgency.</p>
<p>So when the alternately comforting and needling riff to ""Instant Disassembly"" emerges at the halfway point, it not only presents the band with a deserved opportunity to exhale, but also nudges Savage and Austin Brown toward a twin-guitar fadeout that effectively transforms the song from Parquet Courts’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5OeoVkTDLM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Here""</a> into its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuZyMx2NXZM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Free Bird""</a>. But Parquet Courts take their greatest liberties with the roughshod rumble of ""Raw Milk"", which gets distended to more than twice its original length through an extended feedback meltdown that proves to be an unexpectedly affecting setup for <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>’s closing ballad ""Into the Garden"". Parquet Courts may not be playing Bonnaroo this year, though in many respects, they're already there. However, the closing charge through <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>’s hardcore-hammered title track serves as a warning that you hacky-sack to these guys at your own risk.</p></div>"|20238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20238-live-at-third-man-records/|7.5|Stuart Berman

The term sounds oxymoronic, invoking a Bonnaroovian nightmare of twirling and wiggling, but <i>Dance 4 a Dollar</i>—a collaborative EP between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"">Wavves</a>’ Nathan Williams and his brother Kynan’s production duo Sweet Valley and gear-head electro-pop savant Amanda Warner, aka MNDR—is precisely that. Sweet Valley’s rap output has always been a counterpoint to Nathan’s slacked-out rock music, but it's still decidedly too lo-fi to match the high gloss of MNDR tracks like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFL61qQHBhc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fade to Black""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmuT1qUFA4Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Feed Me Diamonds""</a>. Yet, somehow, the three (along with producer Peter Wade) have crafted something hazy and gleaming that isn’t always fighting itself. The five-track collection sounds like it is coming apart at the seams throughout, but some of its threads are luxurious.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The EP opens with Warner cooing, ""Hello, status quo"" over bathwater synths and sleigh bells, almost as if she’s nodding ironically at their unconventional grouping. The track, ""Like Liars"", boasts the most crystalline vocals of the project—which, frankly, should be the most highlighted element here—and you can hear Nathan and Kynan trying to squeeze in too many details, many of which feel like weeded-out epiphanies that would have been removed in the sober light of day. There is evidence that Sweet Valley’s woozy production can work nicely alongside something more upbeat: Back in 2012, Kynan flipped Joanie Sommers’ patriarchy-praising ""Johnny Get Angry"" for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31964-lakutis/"">Lakutis</a>’ lackadaisical <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1CyJzPQah8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Too Ill for the Law""</a>. The sound was fuzzy, but the vibe was hyperfocused. <i>Dance 4 a Dollar </i>could have used some of that precision.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is not to say that the fill-every-cranny-with-another-bleep-bloop-or-blorp approach to the EP is always ineffective. Among the five tracks, some of the chaos works. ""Tongues Like Ghosts"" is what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a> would release if she ever has an LSD phase. The songwriting hews closer to MNDR’s work, sounding enormous and immersive despite the EP’s anarchy. The project is overall a little bit lyrically impotent—the phrase ""Live fast, die young"" should heed its own advice—but Warner turns heads occasionally with curious lines like ""Let’s make love like liars."" The powerful moments are like that, confronting you with something that makes little sense but still sounds beautiful.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Where the collection suffers is when it feels like Sweet Valley’s woozy production takes over. ""Do It Everyday"" is an erratic lullaby. It volleys between sparse melancholia with clip-clopping production that bolsters Warner’s voice and skittering synths which clog up the track. When Warner sings, ""We don’t give a fuck/ And we know it,"" it’s a little too on the nose. The glitchy ""HoldMeAlways MakeBelieve"", meanwhile, is bogged down by too many electronic bells and whistles, which nearly mask Warner’s vocals. When yet another shooting-star synth grazes the track, it’s like learning for the first time that when you mix all the paint colors you don’t get a rainbow, you just get mud. But, perhaps, mud is where stoner dance music belongs.</p></div>"|20283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20283-dance-4-a-dollar-ep/|5.9|Claire Lobenfeld

Hard-earned though the break was, the quintet seemed an arbitrary pick. Over the last half-decade, northern England has reared a sharp and brainy brood of art-pop omnivores, but Dutch Uncles err on the vegetarian side: They’re sleek, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"">Wild Beasts</a> are sleeker; they tweak <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1646-field-music/"">Field Music</a>’s oddball bombast without revamping it; and they tap into a weirdo-pop accessibility that’s neither as weird nor accessible as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29041-everything-everything/"">Everything Everything</a>’s. Given the occasion, their fourth record might have been a bells-and-whistles induction to pop’s champagne elite, but in typically moderate fashion, <i>O Shudder</i> is less concerned with the party booze than the kitchenware.</p>
<p>That could be a criticism, but inertia suits them. Dutch Uncles still sound spritely, but as their thirties loom, <i>O Shudder </i>finds them shaping up to settle down. Rather than an agonising compromise, their songs confront domesticity as a playful challenge: Opener ""Babymaking"" fathoms parenthood like a rigged Rubik’s Cube, while ""In N Out"" sketches a sexual entanglement in lyrical riddles as slippy and perplexing as interesting relationships invariably are. It’s an album wounded by suspicion and longing, but the band stay bright and limber, perhaps leaving disenchantment to those fool enough to have been enchanted to begin with.</p>
<p>Holding it up is Duncan Wallis, the kind of mildly eccentric pop singer who seems like he’d spend a long time ironing his shirts. Where marketable songwriters weaponize potent emotions, or at least sound certain of their uncertainty, Wallis precariously grasps for tangible feelings that rarely materialize. On ""I Should Have Read"" he navigates criss-cross piano lines with chronic trepidation, his shy falsetto evoking a child in a mirror maze; on job-hunt saga ""Decided Knowledge"" he blurts jumpy exclamations, flitting between inner and outer monologues, as if he finds it awkward to have a voice at all.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If Wallis’ exhortations find solace, it’s in the backdrop’s orchestral splendour, a complex lattice of woodwind, strings, percussion, and marimba that winds up feeling improbably cosy and lived-in. The band’s secret weapon is Robin Richards, their composer and bassist, and his<i> </i>handiwork here glistens, ranging from elegantly odd curiosities (""Babymaking"", ""Drips"") to obscenely lovely mini-symphonies (""I Should Have Read"", ""Given Thing""). On the livelier ""Upsilon"" and ""Don’t Sit Back (Frankie Said)"", Dutch Uncles defibrillate third- or fourth-hand R&amp;B with twinkly synths and piston bass pops, signposting the sort of disjointed grooves by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14503-japan/"">Japan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a> that might’ve soundtracked their parents’ own baby-making.</span></p>
<p>Maybe it’s telling that their most obvious touchstones—<i>Speaking in Tongues</i>, early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5414-prefab-sprout/"">Prefab Sprout</a>—hail from Reagan and Thatcher’s '80s. Recession-ready and armed against austerity, Dutch Uncles write physically involving tunes that rectify UK indie’s groove deficit while tentatively reviving the vast emotion of balladeers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10546-tears-for-fears/"">Tears for Fears</a>. The formula seems corny, but when Dutch Uncles fall short, it’s for the opposite reason: Though the busy, Reichian loops help decorate the retro palette, it's the sort of intricacy that can encase art-pop in bulletproof glass, demanding admiration without meeting us halfway. At its best, though, <i>O Shudder</i>'s timeworn skill is to combat looming adversity with verve and rhythm, emptying the mind through the body.</p></div>"|20248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20248-dutch-uncles-o-shudder/|7.0|Jazz Monroe

Naturally, they're bound to get comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5913-alcest/"">Alcest</a>, and while they are contemporaries of both, they barely resemble one another. On the surface, they keep black metal’s fuzzy hum that Alcest and others have consciously dropped. The Dutch trio also exert much more of a post-hardcore influence, which is evident in their shorter songs. More significantly, there’s a damaged aspect to their music, with strings and synths breaking out haphazardly. <i>The Long Goodbye</i> is their fifth full-length release, following <i>Try Not to Destroy Everything You Love</i>, which honed their sound while keeping it endearingly messy. This album cleans up some more of the racket.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unlike most bands who focus more on the gaze than the black, AAFCC still have a fairly abrasive guitar tone, evident in the opening rings of the title track. You can detect a melody beneath, but despite the dream pop influences, the guitars are more blinding than soothing. Even so, there’s variety to be found in <i>Goodbye</i>, an advantage brought on by shorter overall song lengths. ""A New Form of Stillness"" is jangle pop under the spell of the second wave—grimness comes after bounciness. There are plenty of black metallers who will jam <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> on the low, but the bassline from ""Stillness"" makes <span>AAFCC</span>'s fandom public. ""Endless Skies"" (which has a vaguely trip-hop intro) and ""The Sleep of Rust"" are set within a depressive black metal framework, but the conflicting nature of grime and glory presented throughout <i>Goodbye</i> adds a dimension most sadsacks can’t comprehend. ""She’s Drawing Mountains"" may be the highlight of the album, as the melodies flex and compete with the onslaught of blackened drone.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Goodbye</i><span>’s synth work is what raises AAFCC above the blackgaze fray. Like most black metal keyboards, they’re not technically complex and primarily function as ambient waves; where they differ with AAFCC is that they can be an antagonizing force in addition to the guitars. They don’t exactly intrude upon the music, but they don’t make a graceful entrance either. In ""When Night Leaves Again"" they’re particularly unsettling, as if encouraging the drums to lose their composure. ""Only Skin""’s intro comes at you like bright lights and a refreshing bucket of water dumped on your worst hangover. The torrent that surfaces afterwards is almost a relief. There was a period in time when black metal bands boasted about </span><span>not</span><span> using keyboards—thankfully, AAFCC weren’t paying attention.<br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Listening to <i>Goodbye</i>, it’s evident that AAFCC are also students of Lifelover, a Swedish band who were pioneers in mixing post-punk and black metal. Before guitarist and leader B’s passing in 2011, they found a way to make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11987-burzum/"">Burzum</a>’s buzz blend with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">the Cure</a>’s basslines, and few have been able to match them since. Lifelover also had a knack for somber piano melodies that would drive the song more than the guitars on the forefront; AAFCC channel this at the end of ""Converging Towards the Light"", where the piano nearly overtakes the guitar during the final hurrah. AAFCC aren’t clones—they mutate Lifelover’s ethos into a gnarlier, and at the same time beautiful, sound.</p></div>"|20260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20260-an-autumn-for-crippled-children-the-long-goodbye/|7.4|Andy O'Connor

By now, it’s up there with ""ethereal"" as one of the most mercilessly abused descriptors in the music critic’s arsenal, and I’m still not exactly sure what it <i>means</i>. Sometimes it feels like nothing but buzz terminology for tastemaker companies like record label <a href=""http://fadetomind.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fade to Mind</a>, ""post-Internet lifestyle magazine"" <a href=""http://dismagazine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DIS Magazine</a>, or youth-centric streetwear label <a href=""https://www.hoodbyair.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hood by Air</a>. It’s easy to see why we’re so drawn to the concept, though. In Internet media especially, our appetite for newness has grown almost unsustainable—fuck right now, what’s happening <i>next?</i> All this ""forward thinking"" has dropped us at a disorienting crossroads: We’ve got unprecedented access to previously unreachable parts of the world, a constantly refreshing news feed, we’ve got 27 tabs open, and oh god, we’re still so terribly bored.</p>
<p class=""normal"">In concept, Future Brown’s promise is both realistic and utopian: A multi-media reflection of club and street music from across the globe, lovingly curated, and an idealistic glimpse of what the Internet at its best can facilitate—a democracy where genre is revealed as a construct so the real fun can begin. The project is a natural extension of the work of its four members: producer and composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30056-fatima-al-qadiri/"">Fatima Al Qadiri</a>, <a href=""http://litcitytrax.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lit City Trax</a> founder <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32385-j-cush/"">J-Cush</a>, and Asma Maroof and Daniel Pineda of production/DJ duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29623-nguzunguzu/"">Nguzunguzu</a>. These guys are known for their omnivorous, boundary-refuting DJ sets and club nights as much as their official releases; Nguzunguzu’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15395-the-perfect-lullaby/""><i>Perfect Lullaby</i></a> set a new standard for post-regional, no-rules DJ mixes in 2011. With their self-titled debut album, released via <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a>, the ethos is the same but the budget is bigger: The quartet provides the beats for a rotating cast of featured guests who traffic in styles as seemingly disparate as bop, grime, dancehall, and drill. Theoretically, everyone is pushed out of their respective comfort zones, geography-defying parallels are drawn, underappreciated street artists get some well-deserved shine, and we all turn up in the process. Everyone wins!</p>
<p class=""normal"">Theoretically, that is. But if we are to invest so heavily in theory here, we should probably get our theories straight. As Future Brown’s members would describe it, this is very much a free-form, vibes-based passion project, steered by the unrestricted contributions of the featured collaborators as much as the producers’ whims. ""It’s all on accident. The thing that unites Future Brown is that there’s very little agenda,"" said Al Qadiri in a<a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/future-brown-album-vernaculo/?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a><a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/future-brown-album-vernaculo/?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>T Magazine</i></a><a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/future-brown-album-vernaculo/?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> feature</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p class=""normal"">But for a freewheeling happy accident, there’s a fair bit of vague art school conceptualism floating around the project. The video for ""Vernáculo"", featuring Maluca,<a href=""http://www.pamm.org/vernaculo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a><a href=""http://www.pamm.org/vernaculo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">premiered</a> at Art Basel last year as ""an exercise in capitalist surrealism"" (a descriptor that could easily apply to Art Basel itself). There’s the glossy and hi-def <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkJOzLj7fNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">basketball imagery</a>, the sort of winking, hyper-mundane meta-commercial iconography we’ve come to expect from DIS Magazine, who designed the album art. These slapped-on layers of meaning only distract from what this project could be at its best: surprising, accessible, genuinely utopian.</p>
<p class=""normal"">If the project’s sense of purpose seems a bit scattershot on paper—it’s about everything and nothing, partying and post-postmodernism, global street music and the New York art world, commodity fetishism and basketball—that ambiguity is even more apparent in sound. As thrilling as this tracklist appears at a glance—UK grime originators butting up against Chicago drill newcomers! Generations of feminist rap underbosses aligning!—the resulting tracks are weirdly unremarkable. The album has its moments: on ""Big Homie"", icy steel drums draw Sicko Mobb’s Lil Trav and Lil Ceno out of their usual Rainbow Road soundscapes into somewhere colder and more cavernous.</p>
<p class=""normal"">But for a project lauded as progressive, I’m not so sure what’s being pushed forward here. We’ve heard sounds like these, and better, on Future Brown’s solo members’ side projects. We’ve seen these visual aesthetics (frankly, they peaked in 2012 on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30014-jam-city/"">Jam City</a>’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16768-classical-curves/""> </a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16768-classical-curves/""><i>Classical Curves</i></a> album art). And most regrettably, the featured artists’ guest spots rarely do justice to what makes them special in their own right. Even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32024-tink/"">Tink</a>, the irrepressible, multi-talented Chicagoan who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a>’s called the next <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"">Aaliyah</a>, sounds just okay on her two showcases here. ""Room 302"" and ""Wanna Party"" are decent songs, but instead of a mutually stimulating partnership, they kinda sound like Tink verses plopped over grime beats.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Club music doesn’t need to come with a thesis to be worthy of further investigation—if anything, a thesis is an impediment. But if you’re going to start a conversation, you should be prepared to finish it, and <i>Future Brown</i> feels overwhelmingly like a bunch of intriguing ideas left to drift off inconclusively. It’s an album of aesthetics and not many ideas, and that’s just fine. But it’s okay to let a basketball be a basketball, and not an orb imbued with the power of community, or something. It would seem that Future Brown has been so focused on forward motion that they’ve gotten ahead of themselves. The thrill of discovery from unexpected juxtapositions, the kind that makes you feel like the world is a more intimate, interconnected place, that happens organically in the Future Brown members’ DJ sets, doesn’t feel as thrilling as promised.</p>

A hopeless stan approaches Hodgy for a photo at what sounds like the annual Odd Future carnival, in much the same manner as the fans who accosted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"">Tyler, the Creator</a> at Six Flags on the OF mastermind's ""Colossus"". Tyler’s song went on to explore the dicey relationship between artists and fans who take their every word as gospel, but Hodgy doesn't seem to have given the issue quite as much thought. Rather than dig into the skit, or go anywhere with it, he regards the fan with total contempt and excuses himself, promising to return. A couple of tracks later, in the skit’s sequel, he’s schooling us on his favorite hash, the pesky admirer abandoned and long-forgotten.</p>
<p>Gerard Damien Long has never displayed the commitment of others in his camp, preferring instead to leap from idea to idea as fast as his jagged, lightning bolt flow will take him. On his new tape, despite his clear effort to inject some substance into his work, what we see is largely more of the same. As always, Hodgy excels at blasé funtime rap, replete with guns and drugs and sex and little in the way of effective personal exploration or storytelling.</p>
<p>Hodgy’s efforts to grow have been the selling point of the tape, and it’s quite obvious when he’s trying to show that he’s matured: on ""Cudda Been"", ""Moneyball"" and ""HakuemeniB"" he drops his usual demonic grin and raps solemnly over beats originally used by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1657-lupe-fiasco/"">Lupe Fiasco</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"">OutKast</a>. But Hodgy has trouble channeling the spirits of these more thoughtful rappers, and his stabs at frank discussion come across as discombobulated and unfocused. At one point on ""Moneyball"" he dedicates a couple of bars to an unclear thought about the relationship between greed and President Obama. Either he doesn’t care to work out what he’s trying to say, or he isn’t really trying to say anything at all. In any case, the next line begins a short discussion of his relationship with a stripper.</p>
<p>Hodgy explains his own personality on the best of these tracks, ""HakuemeniB"", giving us some insight into his weaknesses on wax. He admits to being compulsive and heated, and generally comes across as a hedonist with a heart of gold. It follows, then, that he remains best over punchy, percussive beats. On<i> Dena Tape 2</i>, he slays tracks like ""Da Man"" and ""Wild Boy"" through a light-fingered flow reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"">Azealia Banks</a> at her most agile. Like Banks, Hodgy is purposively provocative, but there isn’t any particular ideological force driving his edgier rhymes, which are often racial jabs like ""Asian eyes like a nigga rap for rice."" <span>(It's worth mentioning that he's part Filipino.) </span>He simply thrives on mayhem, and when fenced in by highly structured, rhythmic production, he shines.</p>
<p>The original <i>Dena Tape</i> was the first solo project ever released under the crew’s umbrella, according to the Odd Future subreddit. Since that time, Hodgy’s had a son, grown from the age of 19 to 24, and released or been featured on over a dozen tapes. And yet it seems like he can’t help but to keep things light. To celebrate himself rather than think about his failings, to toss off an easy punch line instead of working to craft a complex thought, and to mock his loser fans rather than genuinely try to understand, explore or even warrant their admiration. After more than five years, he still comes across as one of the lost boys, happily treading water in Neverland and still not all the way willing to grow up.</p></div>"|20300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20300-dena-tape-2/|5.7|Jonah Bromwich

Though frontman Jon King uniquely channeled both the lithe physicality of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"">Iggy Pop</a> and the suave dignity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1479-bryan-ferry/"">Bryan Ferry</a>, he’s rarely spoken about in the same breath as either. Andy Gill is the quintessential musician’s musician, worshipped and imitated by countless celebrity acolytes (The Edge and Tom Morello among them), but not enough of a household name to land on <i>Rolling Stone</i>’s <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100 Greatest Guitarists</a><i> </i>list. And the rhythm section of Hugo Burnham and Dave Allen was nothing less than the post-punk Bonham and Jones, but didn’t stick together long enough to be widely hailed as such. What each member brought to the table is ultimately best gauged through the process of attrition that has played out over the band’s spasmodic career.</p>
<p>But even if none of the albums King and Gill made without Allen and Burnham recaptured the funky ferocity of their earliest output together, the unmistakable interplay between the singer and guitarist at least marked them as Gang of Four records, in spite of whatever period-specific production signatures defined (and dated) those releases. However, after getting the old band back together in 2004, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3390-return-the-gift/"">updating their back catalog</a>, and even sticking it out for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15032-content/"">a respectable showing</a> after Allen and Burnham bailed once again, it appears the only thing left for Gang of Four to do is to not be Gang of Four. Now that King is out of the picture following his 2011 resignation (to focus on his career in advertising), with <i>What Happens Next</i>, Gang of Four have effectively entered the reality-TV vocal-competition phase of their career, with lone holdout Gill filling the gaping hole at the mic stand with a revolving cast of guest vocalists.</p>
<p>Which is, of course, a perfectly Gang of Four thing to do. After all, inciting the ire of Go4 purists—through sudden changes in direction and personnel—is perhaps the only constant factor in the band’s disjointed trajectory. As the band’s founding member and perennial musical director, it’s well within Gill’s rights to keep the Gang of Four name alive even without the guy who’s sung pretty much all of their songs. But while the guitarist’s signature scabrous funk lashes and ear-piercing feedback frequencies remain ever-present, here they’re in service to a boilerplate post-industrial aesthetic—mid-tempo metronomic beats, distorted-megaphone backing vocals, fuzz-filtered basslines, ominous electronic oscillations—that makes <i>What Happens Next</i> sound more like a mid-'90s alt-rock product than <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r04KgjCdRCw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the album Gang of Four actually released in the mid-'90s</a>. Factor in the singer ringers, and <i>What Happens Next</i> doesn’t so much resemble a new look for a veteran post-punk band as the soundtrack to some dystopian thriller from 20 years ago. (In light of this, you could be forgiven for thinking the closing Gill original ""Dead Souls"" is less a callback to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGs0g2m2Mxc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Joy Division classic of the same name</a> than to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWs8kdGUgDg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails’ remake for <i>The Crow</i></a>.)</p>
<p>That said, it helps Gang of Four’s cause that the technophobic prophecies found in 20-year-old dystopian thrillers are increasingly coming true today. Thematically speaking, <i>What Happens Next</i> updates Gang of Four’s buyer’s-remorse blues (in short: when you consume, you make cons of you and me) for the Internet-addiction age, complete with de rigueur dismissive Facebook references. Playing the role of Gang of Four’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.D._Fortune"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">J.D. Fortune</a>, current touring vocalist John Sterry capably approximates King’s agitated tenor on his several lead turns, if not yet grasping his predecessor’s flair for black humor and understated absurdity; instead, he maintains a self-consciously serious tone throughout, as Gill’s guitars spark up and spasm behind him like lightning flickering above the blackest of clouds. (""Irony is luxury,"" Sterry admonishes on the dirgey ""Obey the Ghost""—clearly, this can’t be the same band that wrote <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00tjF2ROlwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Love a Man in Uniform""</a>.) Only on late-album corker ""Stranded"" do he and Gill approach the sort of intuitive, call-and-response dynamic that powered Gang of Four’s most electrifying songs.</p>
<p>Alas, the match-ups with more famous conspirators yield similarly temperate results, with Gang of Four adapting to their singers’ comfort zones rather than vice versa: The student-disco bangers featuring Alison Mosshart (""Broken Talk"", ""England’s in My Bones"") could very well be souped-up outtakes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2288-the-kills/"">the Kills</a>’ groove-driven <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11302-midnight-boom/""><i>Midnight Boom</i></a>; ""The Dying Rays""—a balladic collaboration with <i>Das Boot</i> star-turned-crooner Herbert Grönemeyer—feels like it’d be more at home on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2577-daniel-lanois/"">Daniel Lanois</a>-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a> album. (Meanwhile, the gear-grinding mecha-funk of ""Graven Image""—with a cameo from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27750-the-big-pink/"">the Big Pink</a>’s Robbie Furze—plays to neither party’s strengths.) Ultimately, what’s most disappointing about <i>What Happens Next</i> is not that it will in any way tarnish Gang of Four’s legacy—if their vanguard reputation could withstand <i>Hard</i> and <i>Mall</i>, it can withstand this. Rather, it’s the unshakeable feeling that, if Gill had released this as some newly branded collaborative project, no one would question why it wasn’t a Gang of Four album.</p></div>"|20233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20233-what-happens-next/|5.3|Stuart Berman

The band's formation in Chicago in 2001 was a natural consequence of the slow-burning fires stoked by pioneering acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"">Isis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"">Neurosis</a>: more specifically, their cumulative, logic proof-like paths to the sublime. From the post-rock salvos of their debut <i>Australasia </i>to their recent effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18662-pelican-forever-becoming/""><i>Forever Becoming </i></a>and its anthemic strivings, Pelican’s artful approach to metal has always been informed by the notion that all the leaden pieces (torrential riffs, sparse drum bursts, mournful synths) will eventually fall into their proper place when granted proper gravity and time. By gutting the easily relatable bits of metal—verse-chorus-verse templates, mach-speed solos, and most importantly, vocals—and placing a stronger emphasis on meditative forms, the band has successfully married post-rock with metal, broadening listeners’ understanding of both. Now all’s left is the singing.</p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Enter <i>The Cliff </i>EP—</span>three reworked versions of the song of the same name from <i>Forever Becoming</i>, plus a previously unheard (and unassuming) cut titled ""The Wait"". The 25-minute affair seems pretty damn skimpy on paper, a treat for diehard fans at best. Fifteen seconds after pressing play, skepticism gives way to surprise as the band brandishes its hidden blade: a human voice, crying out from the striated spaces as if it were howling this whole time. This updated version of ""The Cliff"" marks the first time in six years—and only the second time in their entire career—that the band has recorded a song with vocals, after the title track off 2009’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13670-what-we-all-come-to-need/"">What We All Come to Need</a>. </i>The gravelly, cigarette-shorn tone is a dead ringer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2422-mark-lanegan/"">Mark Lanegan</a>, but the bleary-eyed moans are actually all <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2606-the-life-and-times/"">the Life and Times</a>’ Allen Epley, a post-hardcore veteran cast here as a deranged Lothario incapable of envisioning the concept of ""no"". ""Baby, you’re fighting destiny,"" he deadpans atop ornery riffs and crash of cymbals, ""I’m getting close, you know/ I’m not leaving ‘till you say my name."" As his demands of ""Who do you love?"" eventually coalesce into a somber semi-chant, we realize that Pelican didn’t break their lyrical silence to spout esoteric essays or wax transcendentalist, but rather to profile that familiar beast stalking dives and preying on good intentions—you know, <i>that guy</i>. Coupled with the straightforwardly sludgy music, ""The Cliff""'s subject grounds Pelican’s atmospheric endeavors in a gritty realism; while some might consider this to be regressive, I find it the opposite—a much-needed shift in perspective from a group that’s always had its head in the clouds. </p>
<p class=""p3"">There are two other renditions of ""The Cliff"", both weird and worthwhile. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"">Godflesh</a>’s Justin Broadrick takes the instrumental way down, glitching out the synths and soldering an additional layer of industrial steel to everything to render the entire composition factorylike. The swampy bass rusts into a dull throb, the guitars whirr and rotate and sharpen themselves, and the mechanized drums hiss and clang in time. The vocal remix comes from <a href=""Palms"">Palms</a>, the duo of Isis’ Aaron Harris and Bryant Clifford Meyer, who offer the song a shot of adrenaline. Their version marches along at a slightly quickened pace, spruced up with beefier, more involved drumming and the addition of some woozy samples recorded in reverse.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Both remixes of ""The Cliff"", like the instrumental and vocal versions of the song itself, posit ways in which a more melodically inclined Pelican could operate, vocals or no. I doubt anyone would be seriously dismayed if the group chalked up this EP to a sonic experiment and went back to making turbid masterpieces. At the same time, this little stopgap EP makes the prospect of a catchier, more melodic Pelican all the more appealing. If ""The Cliff"" is any indication, they’ve still got that lyrical touch, meaning there’s an entire narrative mode ready to be shaped by their able hands. For a band that thrives so much in liminal spaces, it would be a mistake to pass up that kind of opportunity.</p></div>"|20256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20256-pelican-the-cliff-ep/|6.7|Zoe Camp

Bruce Smith’s guitar traces sharp, barbed pendulum arcs as synths blaze like welding torches, and Dan Catsis’s bass scours the low end, as though attempting to dig its way out. Over the assembly-line clangor, the familiar atonal caterwaul of Pop Group mainstay <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4130-mark-stewart/"">Mark Stewart</a> rings out. The whole thing sounds like a factory that churns out other factories.</p>
<p>I wish I meant that to be a compliment; these are sounds they’ve been toying with ever since the quartet blazed out of Bristol in '77, after all. But ""Citizen Zombie"", like much of the album that follows, is overcrowded, overserious, oversold. Less dissent than just din and distraction, it’s closer to mid-2000s dance-punk or to early-1990s post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">NIN</a> industrial than late-1970s post-punk. Perhaps because they were more a singles band than an album band—although what a single ""She Is Beyond Good and Evil"" is!—the band never enjoyed the sizable cult following of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">Fall</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a>. Yet they remain influential for their ingenious combination of various genres: As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30790-simon-reynolds/"">Simon Reynolds</a> wrote in <i>Rip It Up and Start Again</i>, ""The genius of the Pop Group lay in the way they were pulled every which way by their passion for black music. They couldn’t settle on just reggae, or just funk, or just jazz, so they went full throttle for all three simultaneously.""</p>
<p>A band that relies on friction to define itself cannot survive long, and by the time they released their third album, <i>We Are Time</i>, in 1980, the Pop Group had exploded in a mushroom cloud of internal conflicts and legal wrangling, to be replaced by splinter groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2988-maximum-joy/"">Maximum Joy</a>, Pigbag, and Rip Rig + Panic. In 2010, the band rose from the dead, with the original members performing a string of reunion shows that lead, sadly but inevitably, right up to <i>Citizen Zombie. </i></p>
<p>Both musically and lyrically, the album is a mess. They were never the most politically nuanced band of their era, but the bluntness of the message often worked in sharp contrast to the antagonism of their music. So many years later, both the music and the message have lost their impact, and the Pop Group have become the ultimate zombie band: They’re back from the dead with no real purpose or direction, and they’re just stumbling around dumbly.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Stewart has taken to repetitive sloganeering, shouting ""citizen zombie"" or ""deny everything"" like he’s clobbering us over the head. He sounds reasonably believable rattling off an anti-consumerist monologue on ""Nations"", but elsewhere he seems to have regressed. The title track grates, not only because the undead have long been deployed as metaphors for everything from the Moral Majority to the military industrial complex, but because Stewart doesn't even stay on message. Soon he’s telling us ""you’ve got the brainwashed look of an alien abductee"" and comparing the hordes to ""a bad, bad robot spinning out of control."" Just pick a sci-fi trope and stick with it. On ""The Immaculate Deception"" he bellows about the ""age of anxiety"" and ""wolves in the throne room,"" but he sounds less like a post-punk eminence than a shouting guy you’d avoid on the subway. Whether he’s railing against game shows on ""Box 9"" or religion on ""St. Outrageous"", the message sounds stale and the targets too easy.</p>
<p>But the most glaring shortcomings of this disinterred Pop Group have to do with space and spontaneity. As teenagers in Bristol, the band members were heavily informed by dub and free jazz, citing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24001-king-tubby/"">King Tubby</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman</a> as influences. The former relies on the space between the notes as much as on the notes themselves, using reverb and delay to convey the shape of a room; the latter is more concerned with shedding the constraints of music, its scales and its structures, in order to arrive at something jarring and new. During their original run, the Pop Group put these ideas to good use: They built a room with deep corners, sharp angles, sloping floors, and no doors or windows, then they razed it.</p>
<p>By contrast, there is almost no space anywhere on <i>Citizen Zombie,</i> beyond the pauses between tracks. Every moment is crammed with stray sound and errant fury: blooms of guitar distortion or thuds of industrial beats or some of the most incongruent backing vocals imaginable. Even closer ""Echelon"", which is the closest this album gets to a quiet moment, eventually piles on the synths and guitars and even a pipe organ. Featuring production by the eclectic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6145-paul-epworth/"">Paul Epworth</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"">Adele</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"">U2</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/"">Cee-Lo Green</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5657-crystal-castles/"">Crystal Castles</a>, among many others), the album sounds scripted and overdetermined, its noise and commotion sculpted to assault your ears. Superficially, it’s successful, in that it’s not easy to listen to these songs. Yet, it feels like a cheap tactic, as if the band don’t trust themselves to get their point across and, worse, don’t trust their listeners to comprehend anything but the most blatant lyric and the most thudding attack. The result of so much suspicion is an album that’s somehow both loud and timid—all clamor and no soul.</p></div>"|20217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20217-citizen-zombie/|2.4|Stephen M.

Though Sean's existence as a rapper was more acknowledged than appreciated, it was undeniable that he had a way of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeTPi2a2Ld4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">running into hits</a>, and sometimes creating them, too. But his second album <i>Hall of Fame</i>, released in the summer of 2013, floundered: After scoring a run of Top 40 hits off both his debut album and various G.O.O.D. Music releases (like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14189-clique/"">""Clique""</a>, which was fleshed out from his demo), Sean spent much of the last year and a half watching <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpnAyk_dbm0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">single</a> after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLBJwGZ8ahA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">single</a> expire upon arrival. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15861-big-sean-control-hof-ft-kendrick-lamar-and-jay-electronica/"">""Control""</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a> showcase that rattled every rapper in New York, was the album’s biggest story for somehow not making the cut.</p>
<p><i>Hall of Fame </i>was not just a problem commercially, but artistically as well. Over the course of his career, Sean has honed his on-mic personality into a charming sort of gleeful obnoxiousness. He is good at being dumb, even if sometimes he is too dumb. His ""ass"" riff that opens G.O.O.D. Music’s ""Mercy""—""ass-quake,"" ""ass-state,"" ""ass-tray""—are his most quintessential lyrics: funny and stupid in not-quite equal measures, but memorable in their shameless goofiness. He is the class clown of rap, entertaining or annoying seemingly at random, but just witty enough that he’s enjoyable to have around. </p>
<p>Too little of that persona was present, though, on his weirdly dour and entirely too serious second album. Where Sean’s debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15605-finally-famous/"">Finally Famous</a> </i>was blandly listenable but anonymous—with its big hits driven by guests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10805-chris-brown/"">Chris Brown</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>—<i>Hall of Fame</i> felt like an overcorrection meant to position him as a rapper’s rapper, the kind of guy who you tune into to focus on lyrics. Big Sean has an appeal, but that is not it.</p>
<p><i>Dark Sky Paradise</i>, his newest, does not wholly shed his aspirations for a certain level of legitimacy, as the nonsensical but very official-sounding title would implicate. But it is by many lengths his best album, and the first one that gets closest to hitting an elusive sweet spot where his music works as mindless fun while still leaving you just enough to chew on. The best example of this is ""I Don’t Fuck With You"", the song that kick-started the album and perhaps saved Sean’s career as we know it. Put online in September along with three other tracks, the song is an obvious banger with an instantly catchy hook and some truly great lines—""I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy""—that also leverages his broken engagement with ""Glee""’s Naya Rivera in a way that feels authentically inspired. That song is where everything clicks for Big Sean, and the confidence he seems to derive from fully harnessing his powers seeps from its pores.</p>
<p>Not all of <i>Dark Sky Paradise </i>is as successful, but when it’s at its best it feels like it came from the same place: a guy rapping more ferociously than he ever has because he knows that he’s better than he ever was. It’s that quantifiable <i>oomph </i>in Sean’s rapping that makes <i>Dark Sky Paradise </i>feel immediately more substantial than anything he’s released. Lyrically, he still straddles a line between being knowingly bald-faced and straight up showing his ass too often—""Headed to the game for OK seats/ Now I’m courtside at OKC""—but there’s palpable kinetic energy in the way he raps now, spitting in an almost-literal sense, his words splattering across beats in places that he may not even have intended.</p>
<p>There’s a controlled but energizing chaos to songs like ""Dark Sky (Skyscrapers)"", the standout Kanye feature ""All Your Fault"", and especially ""Paradise"", which was uploaded to SoundCloud alongside ""I Don't Fuck With You"" but appears here with a new, and fantastic, second verse. On these songs, Sean’s eagerness imbues his music with a sense of urgency that makes his typically dopey lyrics—""I was in Florida, no Marlins, nigga/ I’m that Shawn, no Marlon, nigga""—feel not just like rib-nudging cracks but legitimate boasts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the album only sustains that energy for about half its run time. After ""Paradise""—which is preceded by the admirably boogying R&amp;B palate cleanser ""Play No Games""—<i>Dark Sky Paradise </i>becomes dreary and ponderous much like his second album, with leaden beats running past the five minute mark for no apparent reason. The album picks back up with its closing two tracks—the slightly treacly but skillfully executed ""One Man Can Change the World"" and the DJ Dahi-produced ""Outro"", which chops up a soul song (Darondo’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZqQT5904_U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Didn’t I""</a>) about as well as Kanye ever did—but it’s hard not to feel like the album’s second side represents a major missed opportunity.</p>
<p>The deluxe bonus tracks—most notably the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31708-ariana-grande/"">Ariana Grande</a> collaboration ""Research"", which has a beguilingly tricky beat—help redeem the proceedings, and if you’re the type of person who doesn’t mind actively perfecting tracklists, you can make a pretty solid little rap album by replacing the album’s soft midsection with those three songs. Regardless, <i>Dark Sky Paradise </i>is a big leap in the direction of the ideal Big Sean full-length. Whether he will ever make it there is certainly an open question, but in the meantime the smirkiest rapper in the business finally has an album that justifies all that self-satisfaction.</p></div>"|20220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20220-dark-sky-paradise/|7.1|Jordan Sargent

It unravels with each note, loosening and losing shape, form unspooling into formlessness. ""Dive for the Pearl"" opens the album with a tight, hypnotic mountain reel that’s arguably the most structured performance here—a knotty tangle of banjo plucks, guitar picking, harmonica whines, and mouth harp boings. Later, the title track closes this mini-album out with a long, improvised holler raga, which rambles and deconstructs itself over 16 minutes. There’s something beguiling about that trajectory, which shows just how purposefully these musicians are using old sounds to illuminate new ideas.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Seasonal Hire</i> sounds more like a Black Twig Pickers album than a Steve Gunn album, which may disappoint fans of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18176-steve-gunn-time-off/"">Time Off</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19821-steve-gunn-way-out-weather/"">Way Out Weather</a></i>. He sings lead on only one track, ""Trailways Ramble"", and only on that long closer does his guitar dominate. Everywhere else, he subsumes himself into the band as a fifth Black Twig Picker, which suggests a very democratic collaboration or possibly a solo artist finding some comfort in abdicating the spotlight. A frequent collaborator with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32328-mike-cooper/"">Mike Cooper</a>, and others, Gunn has toured with the band and even hired Black Twig banjo player <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30957-nathan-bowles/"">Nathan Bowles</a> as his drummer for the <i>Weather</i> tour. In 2012, they released a free three-song EP titled <i><a href=""http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Black_Twig_Pickers_and_Steve_Gunn/NATCH_1/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NATCH 1</a></i>, which filtered Middle Eastern musical ideas through Appalachian instrumentation; a year later, Gunn and Twig fiddler Mike Gangloff recorded <i><a href=""http://importantrecords.com/imprec/imprec392"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melodies for a Savage Fix</a></i>, which contained an early, sparer version of ""Dive for the Pearl"".</p>
<p>Even as it builds on those previous collaborations, <i>Seasonal Hire</i> sounds bolder and richer, more purposeful but also more daring. These songs borrow from their respective catalogs to create something new altogether: a kind of drone folk that’s heavy on high-lonesome ambience yet deeply rooted in the clay of regional tradition. Of the five songs, four are originals and only one is a cover, ""Don’t Let Your Deal Go Down"", based on an early 20th-century tune often attributed to Fiddlin’ John Carson. Gangloff’s fiddle takes lead, as he plays a droning intro and then ghosts Bowles’ vocal melody alongside Gunn—both of them one beat behind, like hellhounds on his trails. His scratchy voice could easily fall into the kind of hick caricature that makes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/596-scott-h-biram/"">Scott H. Biram</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15690-field-songs/"">William Elliott Whitmore</a> so hokey, yet Bowles’ weathered timbre evokes the hard experiences motivating the song’s cautionary advice. When he punctuates the performance with a high <i>whooo</i>!—one of the most unguarded and seemingly unrehearsed moments on the record—it sounds like the cry of a man shedding his heavy burdens.</p>
<p>Sally Anne Morgan sings lead on the bouncy jig ""Cardinal 51"" and Gunn takes over on ""Trailways Ramble"", which is arguably the most modern-sounding song on <i>Seasonal Hire</i>—if such a distinctive is even useful. As though sung from the back of a crowded bus in the middle of a long journey, the song conveys movement not through tempo, but through the fluidity with which it shifts from rumination to ramble. Perhaps Gunn’s itinerant narrator is headed west for work, as the title track implies, with its undercurrent of what sounds like industrial machinery. Or perhaps he’s off to no place in particular. As ""Seasonal Hire"" digresses, it mimics the trajectory of getting lost. Rarely does losing your way sound so purposeful and inviting.</p></div>"|20198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20198-seasonal-hire/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

The album produced a hit in ""QueenS"", however, and launched the duo into a career post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15570-black-up/""><i>Black Up</i></a>, where they first gained recognition singing with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28847-shabazz-palaces/"">Shabazz Palaces</a>. Their follow-up, <i>EarthEE</i>, once again eschews easy hooks, creating an atmosphere both otherworldly and familiar through its production and stream-of-consciousness verses. The album, at its best, feels like an alluring, slow meditation on the black imagination.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Said the bird to the water: May I take a sip? May I dip my toes in it?"" sings Harris-White in ""Prophetic Perfection"", the album’s first song. It is a short invitation—or induction—that prepares us for ""No GMO"", a relaxed, smooth house party track that recalls past offerings like ""QueenS"". Like the dream hampton-directed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGWFBt_IPOg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for that song, or the <a href=""%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdwJjgKZNIQ%E2%80%9D"">Black Weirdo</a> parties that THEESatisfaction host, ""No GMO"" exudes a blackness wedded to an exclusive coolness; an invite-only funk that can’t be faked. ""The gods were watching our eyes, keep this shit on the low, so clandestine,"" Stas raps.</p>
<p class=""p3"">The title track, meanwhile, dripping in ankh platitudes via Shabazz Palaces and Porter Ray, is the least intelligent song here. Riddled with borrowed, hotep tropes—""Eritrean queen""; ""Kush goddess""; ""bitches""; ""Nefertiti""—the song pushes simplistic ideas about black women in the service of something that ultimately isn’t that fun or afrocentric. Referencing head wraps, presenting dichotomies like the club vs. literally anywhere else (""Fuck a club, let’s make love in the bathtub""), the song poses as progressive but mostly reinforces gender roles. ""My pretty moms was pro-black,"" though a great line, <span>peddles sexism under the guise of respect for African Queens™.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Most of <i>EarthEE</i> scans like a friend’s spoken word poem read aloud so many times that their sheer conviction makes it stick, mnemonically, to the roof of your mouth. But you can’t simply will catchiness. Something—usually a feeling—needs to hold long after you’ve forgotten the lyrics, and <i>EarthEE </i> makes one think more than feel. Its intelligence—from the interestingly crafted, synthy, intergalactic-sounding beats to the rhymes waxing political and poetic—is unflinching. In terms of evoking deeper sensations, that feel like interstellar, communal prophecy, like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zora Neale Hurston</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">John Coltrane</a> playing double dutch with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"">Missy Elliott</a> on the moon, there’s not much to grab on to. But perhaps that’s where <i>EarthEE’s</i> seductive energy—the meandering intonations, the sage chants—lies. There’s a power, take it or leave it, in music that functions like psychic holdovers until whatever futuristic soundscape comes next.</p></div>"|20227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20227-earthee/|6.8|Safy-Hallan Farah

The Brooklyn-based songwriter's sophomore album, <i>Joey</i>, is crafted from the winsome murmurs and gentle guitar strums of someone left alone to think in their bedroom, and the result is a tender meditation on youthful malaise, intensified by Douglas’s status as a gender outlier. ""Joey"" was apparently the name Douglas’s parents were considering if Douglas ""were born a boy"", and the ambiguous state of identity (Douglas is non-binary, and as such doesn’t identify with any one gender category) is a source of the album’s confusion, yearning and wonder about who ""Tica"" is and where that person fits in the world.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Joey</i>, Douglas’ forlorn ruminations take on philosophical implications. ""I Didn’t"" addresses the dull ache of past regrets with simple, subtly powerful language (""There was a party last night where you used to live/ And I wanted to go… but I didn’t""). Douglas's voice curls off in mournful tendrils on ""Ease""—""I call you over and make up something to make you stay""—and the negative space conveys the weight of the song's loneliness. It’s only through <i>Joey</i>’s casual statements that Douglas gets at the crux of the real burden, which the difficulty of being inside one's own head. ""I hope I don’t exhaust you like I exhaust myself,"" Douglas admits on the album’s opening song, in a voice heavy with palpable fatigue. Drums are used sparingly on <i>Joey</i>, giving the record a sighing feel that counterbalances its heaviest moments.</p>
<p>Because Douglas grew up grappling with the liminal space of gender roles, relationships are the axis around which <i>Joey</i> pivots. ""Know More"" dissects the difficulty of a same-sex relationship: ""And I wanted them to like me,"" goes a line addressing a lover’s parents, ""though I know I’m not quite what they had in mind for you."" References to Douglas' family—""I grew up on the ocean with a family that I loved""—are delivered with a deliberateness that suggests the reflections are too comfortable to be the whole truth. ""And my brother called to talk/ About my parents’ split,"" Douglas later qualifies, ""I thought it never got to me/ But now I think it did."" There’s an underlying sense that <i>Joey</i> is narrated in hindsight, its vignettes strewn together by someone who is still learning from the past.</p>
<p>And yet, the suffering of <i> Joey</i> is balanced with glimmers of optimism. ""You don’t have to be broken/ To make heartbreaking art,"" Douglas sings on ""All Meanness Be Gone"". Here and throughout the album, the nostalgia feels distinctly hopeful, a mix of melancholy and the kind of catharsis that comes with exploring hurt in order to heal it. On ""Too Long"", Douglas reflects on a past relationship (""I learned the pain of too much tenderness""), but drags out the words as if to savor the sting. The harmonies on the record are straightforward—it's just voice and guitar—and the sparseness adds to the record’s intimacy. ""Black &amp; White"" contains a declaration of love and loyalty to a significant other despite years of torment, and in these moments Douglas' voice is so melodious and enveloping that it immerses you like a fog—an atmosphere that’s bleak and enlivening at the same time. ""I never have and never will understand why simple is so difficult,"" Douglas coos as if in summation on ""My My My"". It’s a profoundly relatable sentiment, and the simplicity is part of the charm: The beauty of <i>Joey</i>’s sadness lies in how it dignifies the mundane.</p></div>"|20149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20149-joey/|7.0|Molly Beauchemin

In the twenty-first century he has released an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13001-townes/"">album</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/"">Townes Van Zandt</a> covers, a few collections of agit-Americana, and another inspired by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10710-washington-square-serenade/"">immigrant sounds of New York City</a>—each one so laser-focused musically and thematically that they sound like concept albums. On one hand, the approach gives each record its own distinctive identity within his catalog. When his overarching subject was the idiocy of the Bush Administration he hit paydirt: <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2647-jerusalem/"">Jerusalem</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2650-the-revolution-starts-now/"">The Revolution Starts… Now</a></i> had a hardscrabble righteousness only intensified by the fact that few other singer-songwriters were tackling that particular subject matter at that particular time. Both have aged more gracefully than their topicality would have suggested.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that urge to cordon off genres and ideas seems particularly odd for an artist who changed the course of country music in the 1980s by insisting that everything could be commingled freely. His 1986 debut <i>Guitar Town</i> and 1988's <i>Copperhead Road</i> melded rock guitars and country songwriting, honkytonk rowdiness and folky gentleness, as if to rebuke the timid conservatism of the Nashville mainstream. Even in the 1990s, he emerged from a four-year stint in the clink with a string of adventurous records that made forays into doo-wop, Beatlesque pop, Civil War storytelling, and twangy psychedelica. That eclecticism was—and still is—rousing, yet nowadays each of those creative impulses would get its own neat album.</p>
<p>Earle's latest is also his most specific: <i>Terraplane</i> is his Texas blues album, an homage to the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17413-lightnin-hopkins/"">Lightnin' Hopkins</a> and Mance Lipscomb, Robert Johnson and Stevie Ray Vaughn, Freddy King and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7321-zz-top/"">ZZ Top</a>. There are no cheeseball <a href=""http://youtu.be/ZaM6lTmhnak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blueshammer</a> theatrics, which often accompany blues records made by non-blues artists. Earle's more interested in craft than ostentation, and his touring band the Dukes keep things raw and wiry, as though everything was caught in one take during Shiner runs. Only on ""Baby's Just as Mean as Me"", a he said/she said duet with Eleanor Whitmore, do Earle's blues sound less than casually persuasive.</p>
<p>To his credit, Earle understands that Texas is a big place and therefore Texas blues is a broad term that encompasses various sounds and song forms. <i>Terraplane</i> volleys from acoustic to electric, from solo delivery to full-band performances, from pop melodies to spoken-word verses. He conjures some fire and brimstone on a talking blues called ""The Tennessee Kid"", which would be one of the best songs here if it didn't so readily buy into some of the persistent myths orbiting the blues: reaching the crossroads, meeting the devil, selling your soul. These seem like tired tropes, equivalent to naming your album after a Robert Johnson song, yet Earle brings so much grit and wiliness to the song that you <i>almost</i> don't roll your eyes when he name-drops ""Bob Johnson.""</p>
<p>The blues is often mischaracterized as uniformly worried and woeful, as though a hellhound were on every strummer's trail, yet that is only one facet of the form. It can also be funny, or randy, and it's this last trait that Earle taps into most eagerly, as <i>Terraplane</i> is his lustiest album in a long while. Sex is the major theme, and Earle beholds his hard-on with a self-effacing chuckle. The first song is called ""Baby Baby Baby (Baby)"", and that parenthetical aside is not only his best punchline but a winking nod to the ridiculousness of it all. Casting him as the leering oldie, ""Go-Go Boots Are Back"" may be his most frivolous song yet, but its lack of gravity is freeing, even funny. Nevertheless, the concept framing <i>Terraplane</i> also reduces its scope and limits its impact. It's good for what it is—better than it needs to be, in fact—yet what it is is only a fraction of what it could be, if only Earle would stop trying to tidy up his inspirations.</p></div>"|20282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20282-terraplane/|6.3|Stephen M.

They were fully formed from the first repetition of the ""Good Times Bad Times"" riff, and they powered along through their first half-dozen albums crushing everything in their path. Zep never had their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13435-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band/""><i>Sgt. Pepper's</i></a>, their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14264-exile-on-main-st-deluxe-edition/""><i>Exile</i></a>, their <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Who-Whos-Next/master/68469"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Who's Next</i></a>, because <i>every</i> album was more or less that good—for a while, anyway. This was a band that knew the music it wanted to make and executed it with ruthless precision. The second trio of Led Zeppelin reissues (the fourth album and <i>Houses of the Holy</i> came out last fall, <i>Physical Graffiti</i> this week) found the band inhabiting what Neil Tennant once described (and Tom Ewing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/poptimist/7811-poptimist-29/"">fleshed out</a>) as their ""imperial phase."" Riding on their massive initial success, and pushed even further by the game-changing success of ""Stairway to Heaven"", everything they tried during these years somehow worked.</p>
<p>If you grew up on classic rock radio, you sometimes felt like you were listening to Led Zeppelin's fourth album on shuffle. It has eight songs, all of them are huge, and one, ""Stairway to Heaven"", frequently lingers near the top of lists of the Greatest Rock Songs of All Time. Given its place in culture, <i>IV</i> can seem like an album of moments more than songs. Individual parts have been selected, cropped, amplified, and dropped into both songs by other artists and into our collective unconscious. Every song has two or three sections that are instantly identifiable and always seem to be playing somewhere nearby. The circular guitar figure in ""Black Dog""; the chiming mandolin in ""Going to California""; Bonham's cymbal bashing on ""Rock and Roll"". It's hard to hear ""When the Levee Breaks"", by now, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7M7d8u40I4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">not think</a> of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4EItD1aOCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hip-hop</a>. If Led Zeppelin's music formed the DNA of anything that could remotely be called ""hard rock,"" <i>IV</i> is a petri dish overflowing with stem cells. The debut was darker and moodier, <i>II</i> was heavier, and <i>III</i> was prettier, but the fourth album is a triumph of form meeting function.</p>
<p>""Stairway to Heaven"" is so ubiquitous that it cycles through phases of deep reverence and self-parody, and the movement between these two poles is so rapid it all becomes a blur. This happens both for individual listeners (I'm going to guess the very young still discover this song and have their idea of what a rock song can be expanded considerably) and on the level of mass culture. It's both a marker of religion and an instant punchline, a singularity that sucks in a world of experience and observation and jeering laughter and sincere tears and compacts it all into an infinitely dense point. Like many who both love it and hate it, I pretty much never need to hear it again. But ""Stairway"" aside, <i>IV</i> is their least weird album. It's basically their stab at perfection, and they get there, but this band was always at its most interesting at the margins, when they had the possibility of failure.</p>
<p>By 1973, Zeppelin's only competition for Biggest Band in the World was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">the Stones</a>, who were losing their hunger. Later that year, the Stones would put out <i>Goat's Head Soup</i>, beginning a period of drift they wouldn't return from until 1978's <i>Some Girls</i>. The field was clear, with the '60s starting to recede in the rearview, but punk was still a couple of years away, Zeppelin didn't waste the opportunity. <i>Houses of the Holy</i>, their fifth album in four years, takes the most powerful moments of the fourth album and amplifies them, and also adds some oddball experiments that flesh out the Led Zeppelin story.</p>
<p>They are most in the zone on ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", which is on a very short list of best songs Zep ever wrote, which is to say that it's among the best rock songs ever written. Everything they ever did well—pastoral beauty, crunchy riffs, stop/start changes, monster drum grooves—could be found on this single track. ""The Ocean"" features what could be Jimmy Page's single greatest riff. ""The Rain Song"" is a masterful study in the power of guitar tone, both for its full acoustic strumming and the electric guitar work that has always evoked the weather of its title. John Paul Jones' gorgeous Mellotron passage is one of the definitive uses of that strange instrument. And ""No Quarter"" is a disorienting bad-vibes epic, archetypal of the '70s, capturing the bleak interiority of a certain kind of drug experience.</p>
<p><i>Houses of the Holy</i> is a perfectly reasonable choice for best Zeppelin LP, even if it had signs that the band couldn't last forever. ""The Song Remains the Same"" is the first sign of Robert Plant using a more pinched sound for his upper register, adapting to that gradually disappearing top octave by contorting his vocals into a strange squeal. By the last two Zeppelin records this would be his default approach when singing in this range. ""The Crunge"" is a sour version of funk, a weirdly fascinating half-song complete with a groaner of a James Brown joke. John Bonham supposedly disliked ""D'yer Mak'er"" so much he refused to write an interesting drum part, sticking instead with the first shuffle beat that came to mind. It was Zeppelin's stab at reggae, and though they never try to breathe any space or light into the mix, it's impossible to dismiss the song's easy catchiness, its affection for doo-wop melody, the motion of Page's spindly guitar.</p>
<p><i>Houses of the Holy</i> might be Zeppelin's most impressive album on a purely sonic level, and this particular remaster reinforces that notion. The best remastering jobs always offer a subtle improvement—a touch of EQing here, a bit more volume there without overdoing it. Taken together, they hopefully offer more detail, and these versions make the grade. The bonus discs, however, continue to be disappointing.

<p>Among the first six records, aside from <i>III</i>, <i>Physical Graffiti</i> suffers least from overfamiliarity. It's Led Zeppelin's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13432-the-beatles/"">White Album</a>, the one they made when they were at their creative peak and had a million ideas, but were also under a tremendous amount of strain and saw the end starting to come into focus. It's also, to my ears, their best album, even if it's not as unified or complete as some of what had come before. Why their best? First of all, <i>there's more of it</i>. The previous two albums were awesome, but each had just eight songs; <i>Physical Graffiti</i> has 15. It's math—when you are talking about songs from this period of the band, that makes it roughly twice as good.</p>
<p>But <i>Physical Graffiti</i> is Zeppelin's best album ultimately because it felt like a culmination. In some senses it was literally so, since its tracks had been recorded over the course of the previous few years and, in some cases, were leftovers from the previous few records. (The best of the new material was still too much for a single record, so they went back to unreleased songs and decided to flesh out a full 2xLP. The songs are all over the place, but the band makes it all work together.)</p>
<p>Iconic riffs abound—""Custard Pie"", ""The Wanton Song"", and ""Houses of the Holy"" alone have more hooks than most rock bands manage in a career—but here they are just the beginning of the story. ""In My Time of Dying"" is Zeppelin's ultimate blues deconstruction, mixing the open-chord slide of acoustic Delta blues with electric heaviness and extending the whole thing past 11 minutes. Pastoral instrumentals had been in the mix for Zeppelin since the first album's ""Black Mountainside"", but Page never managed another one as beautiful as ""Bron-Yr-Aur"", a crushingly brief two minutes of guitar bliss that every rock kid who picked up an acoustic guitar in the next 10 years dreamed of playing. And their non-Western dabbling crested with ""Kashmir"". But <i>Physical Graffiti's</i> greatest strength is its looseness and general sense of playfulness. Here and there, Zeppelin showed comfort with pop. The bounce of ""Trampled Under Foot"" owes everything to Stevie Wonder; ""Down By the Seaside"" has an easeful lilt; and ""Night Flight"" twinkles with a bright optimism.</p>
<p>The song I returned to most here is also the simplest—""Boogie With Stu"", an interpolation of Ritchie Valens' ""Ooh My Head"" (his mother gets a songwriting credit). It makes me think of what blues and early rock'n'roll meant to a certain generation of young men growing up in England during the 1950s and '60s. You hear one story after another about lives being changed by a rock'n'roll record.

They were fully formed from the first repetition of the ""Good Times Bad Times"" riff, and they powered along through their first half-dozen albums crushing everything in their path. Zep never had their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13435-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band/""><i>Sgt. Pepper's</i></a>, their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14264-exile-on-main-st-deluxe-edition/""><i>Exile</i></a>, their <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Who-Whos-Next/master/68469"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Who's Next</i></a>, because <i>every</i> album was more or less that good—for a while, anyway. This was a band that knew the music it wanted to make and executed it with ruthless precision. The second trio of Led Zeppelin reissues (the fourth album and <i>Houses of the Holy</i> came out last fall, <i>Physical Graffiti</i> this week) found the band inhabiting what Neil Tennant once described (and Tom Ewing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/poptimist/7811-poptimist-29/"">fleshed out</a>) as their ""imperial phase."" Riding on their massive initial success, and pushed even further by the game-changing success of ""Stairway to Heaven"", everything they tried during these years somehow worked.</p>
<p>If you grew up on classic rock radio, you sometimes felt like you were listening to Led Zeppelin's fourth album on shuffle. It has eight songs, all of them are huge, and one, ""Stairway to Heaven"", frequently lingers near the top of lists of the Greatest Rock Songs of All Time. Given its place in culture, <i>IV</i> can seem like an album of moments more than songs. Individual parts have been selected, cropped, amplified, and dropped into both songs by other artists and into our collective unconscious. Every song has two or three sections that are instantly identifiable and always seem to be playing somewhere nearby. The circular guitar figure in ""Black Dog""; the chiming mandolin in ""Going to California""; Bonham's cymbal bashing on ""Rock and Roll"". It's hard to hear ""When the Levee Breaks"", by now, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7M7d8u40I4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">not think</a> of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4EItD1aOCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hip-hop</a>. If Led Zeppelin's music formed the DNA of anything that could remotely be called ""hard rock,"" <i>IV</i> is a petri dish overflowing with stem cells. The debut was darker and moodier, <i>II</i> was heavier, and <i>III</i> was prettier, but the fourth album is a triumph of form meeting function.</p>
<p>""Stairway to Heaven"" is so ubiquitous that it cycles through phases of deep reverence and self-parody, and the movement between these two poles is so rapid it all becomes a blur. This happens both for individual listeners (I'm going to guess the very young still discover this song and have their idea of what a rock song can be expanded considerably) and on the level of mass culture. It's both a marker of religion and an instant punchline, a singularity that sucks in a world of experience and observation and jeering laughter and sincere tears and compacts it all into an infinitely dense point. Like many who both love it and hate it, I pretty much never need to hear it again. But ""Stairway"" aside, <i>IV</i> is their least weird album. It's basically their stab at perfection, and they get there, but this band was always at its most interesting at the margins, when they had the possibility of failure.</p>
<p>By 1973, Zeppelin's only competition for Biggest Band in the World was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">the Stones</a>, who were losing their hunger. Later that year, the Stones would put out <i>Goat's Head Soup</i>, beginning a period of drift they wouldn't return from until 1978's <i>Some Girls</i>. The field was clear, with the '60s starting to recede in the rearview, but punk was still a couple of years away, Zeppelin didn't waste the opportunity. <i>Houses of the Holy</i>, their fifth album in four years, takes the most powerful moments of the fourth album and amplifies them, and also adds some oddball experiments that flesh out the Led Zeppelin story.</p>
<p>They are most in the zone on ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", which is on a very short list of best songs Zep ever wrote, which is to say that it's among the best rock songs ever written. Everything they ever did well—pastoral beauty, crunchy riffs, stop/start changes, monster drum grooves—could be found on this single track. ""The Ocean"" features what could be Jimmy Page's single greatest riff. ""The Rain Song"" is a masterful study in the power of guitar tone, both for its full acoustic strumming and the electric guitar work that has always evoked the weather of its title. John Paul Jones' gorgeous Mellotron passage is one of the definitive uses of that strange instrument. And ""No Quarter"" is a disorienting bad-vibes epic, archetypal of the '70s, capturing the bleak interiority of a certain kind of drug experience.</p>
<p><i>Houses of the Holy</i> is a perfectly reasonable choice for best Zeppelin LP, even if it had signs that the band couldn't last forever. ""The Song Remains the Same"" is the first sign of Robert Plant using a more pinched sound for his upper register, adapting to that gradually disappearing top octave by contorting his vocals into a strange squeal. By the last two Zeppelin records this would be his default approach when singing in this range. ""The Crunge"" is a sour version of funk, a weirdly fascinating half-song complete with a groaner of a James Brown joke. John Bonham supposedly disliked ""D'yer Mak'er"" so much he refused to write an interesting drum part, sticking instead with the first shuffle beat that came to mind. It was Zeppelin's stab at reggae, and though they never try to breathe any space or light into the mix, it's impossible to dismiss the song's easy catchiness, its affection for doo-wop melody, the motion of Page's spindly guitar.</p>
<p><i>Houses of the Holy</i> might be Zeppelin's most impressive album on a purely sonic level, and this particular remaster reinforces that notion. The best remastering jobs always offer a subtle improvement—a touch of EQing here, a bit more volume there without overdoing it. Taken together, they hopefully offer more detail, and these versions make the grade. The bonus discs, however, continue to be disappointing. From one angle, there's actually something admirable about how little Led Zeppelin left in the vaults. It was a testament to their brutal efficiency as a rock machine. But aside from the live set released with the debut, the bonus discs so far have been the definition of ""fans only.""</p>

Recorded in his living room while he worked a day job teaching cinema in Florida, his early Iron &amp; Wine material examined harsh truths about the precarious nature of marriage and family: Every child grows up and leaves home, every friendship is eventually defined by distance and difference, every marriage ends in death and loneliness. ""One of us will die inside these arms,"" he sang on ""Naked As We Came"", off 2004’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4127-our-endless-numbered-days/"">Our Endless Numbered Days</a>. ""</i>One will spread our ashes ‘round the yard."" It wasn’t always easy to hear that kind of clear-eyed sentiment, so it couldn’t have been easy to deliver it night after night after night.</p>
<p>Beam’s first forays away from that kind of minimalist folk and its treacherous intimacy were promising, with the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4128-woman-king-ep/"">Woman King</a> </i>EP and his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4129-in-the-reins-ep/"">mini-album</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"">Calexico</a> leading right up to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10691-the-shepherds-dog/"">The Shepherd’s Dog</a></i> in 2007, still a career high. If subsequent albums have sounded less inventive and immediate, the reason wasn’t so much the widescreen arrangements, the experiments with psychedelic jazz and free rock, or even the full band Beam took into the studio and out on the road. Instead, it was a new tack in songwriting, which found him experimenting with fleeting impressionism over concrete details. Each new record put more and more space between Beam and the listener; his songs began to sound affected and oddly distant, as though he were filming a movie whose action took place entirely in the middle distance.</p>
<p>Coming at the end of that ho-hum run of albums, this new rarities catch-all <i>Archive Series Volume No. 1</i> arrives like a breath of fresh air. Beam is currently between labels, with a few rumored collaborative projects (a duets record with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10471-jesca-hoop/"">Jesca Hoop</a>, a covers album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6993-ben-bridwell/"">Ben Bridwell</a>) overshadowing any talk of his next studio album. While it certainly doesn’t constitute a do-over, it does gently recall a time when he was just beginning to form a strong connection with his listeners and when he could take that indie folk sound in any direction imaginable. Tucked under the bed or squirreled away in the guest bedroom closet, these songs become a point from which to measure his decade-long career, to see how far he has come since he made those first home recordings.</p>
<p>It’s bracing to hear him in this familiar setting once again, to hear the roomy ambience of opener ""Slow Black River"", a song strong enough to hold its own against anything on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4126-the-creek-drank-the-cradle/"">The Creek Drank the Cradle</a>. </i>But it’s also a good reminder of just how intricate his minimalist folk arrangements could be. Most of these songs feature just voice and guitar, yet there is a lot going on. There’s a physicality to Beam’s guitar playing, which makes even the slower tunes sound both urgent and casual. The lo-fi production erases any sense of depth in the production, which might be a problem for many artists but here it means that every instrument and every sound is on the same plane—a small wall of sound.</p>
<p>Beam’s strums can be percussive and quietly emphatic, highlighting the breeziness of the melody on ""The Wind Is Low"" and evoking a sinister force driving ""Minor Piano Keys"". When he adds instruments—a bass on ""Judgement"" [sic] or the slide guitar on ""Loretta"" or what sounds like a mandolin on ""Wade Across the Water""—it’s restrained and specific, like a soundtrack composer insinuating emotions onscreen. On the lo-fi ""Quarters in a Pocket"" a rambunctious banjo conjures a contentment tinged with sadness: ""Time spent with you feels like charcoal sketches for a painting that you won’t let me see,"" he sings over the spiky picking and plucking. ""But I’ve come to find that comfort comes like quarters in a pocket, discovered accidentally.""</p>
<p>Much like 2009’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13041-around-the-well/"">Around the Well</a></i>, the 2xCD retrospective that acted as an epilogue to his <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a> tenure and provides a template for <i>Volume No. 1</i>, the songs on here are surprisingly strong, such that any of them could have appeared on a proper album at any point in Beam’s decade-plus career. But the collection never sounds like the sum of its parts. That may be due to the absence of the kind of overarching idea that animates his studio albums, or with the fact that at 16 tracks <i>Volume No. 1</i> is simply too generous. That’s the nature of any kind of vault-clearing compilation: Instead of a simple snapshot of a period in his career, Beam has created something more like a charcoal sketch. Hopefully, more volumes will soon follow.</p></div>"|20199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20199-archive-series-volume-no-1/|7.2|Stephen M. Deusner

Essential ingredients of their sound remain—expanses of sound, culled from improvisations stretched out into infinity—but here they mainline nature more directly than ever before. Throw in the darkness that often cloaks their music, and the fact that some of it was <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Eternal-Tapestry/Wild-Strawberries#.VOZWI1PF9BI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recorded</a> over a bunch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24159-phish/"">Phish</a> cassette bootlegs, and it becomes something akin to a full-gamut hippie experience, lost somewhere between quiet introspection and howling bad dreams. Eternal Tapestry slice right down the middle of that juxtaposition, giving in to both good and evil as they progress.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Committing to <i>Wild Strawberries </i>is a daunting undertaking; unlike its namesake, the rather more concise Ingmar Bergman <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Strawberries_%28film%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">film</a> of the same name, this is a place where sprawl begets sprawl, coming in just shy of 90 minutes in length. It's cosmic music with an earthy tone, slowly ricocheting between the stars and the ground, recalling similarly minded souls such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12-acid-mothers-temple/"">Acid Mothers Temple</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Guru"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guru Guru</a>. <i>Wild Strawberries</i> has distinct parts, becoming looser and more rock-focused at the beginning, with deeper experimentation in its back half. The transition from the jammy title track, built on a twinkly organ drone pricked with guitar solos, to the closing ""White Adder's Tongue""—all bare husks of sound, slowly uncoiling drones, and a purposefully dysfunctional loop that envelopes half of its 15-minute duration—highlights the band's breadth.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Loose ends fray at the seams of these songs, sometimes to their detriment, when the players don't appear to have a good sense of where they're heading. ""Enchanter's Nightshade"" treads a circular path similar to the one taken on ""Wild Strawberries"", but can't reach the same level of transcendence, rarely getting away from the sense of a bunch of guys jamming on a half-formed idea. When they fall back on familiar psych-rock trappings, Eternal Tapestry fall short, mostly because they're so obviously trying to surpass them elsewhere. Echoed vocals, such a staple of the genre, feel like a splotch across the glassy surface of the minimalist ""Maidenhair Spleenwort"".</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-546ea51d-a3be-ebbf-1346-805368daf786"">If the ideas on <i>Wild Strawberries</i> don't always appear to coalesce, it's a problem with which Eternal Tapestry are well aware. Talking in a recent <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/eternal-tapestry-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> of their time in the cabin, they explain how it ""let us completely let down our guards and do whatever we want all the time,"" producing an atmosphere where they ""didn't have a lot of focus."" The material they extracted from that period is endemic to such a process, but it's still intermittently impressive how they manage to zone in on a sharp piece of mystical riffing or lay out on an elegant ambient plane. The quieter work here may suggest a way forward, but <i>Wild Strawberries</i> has a transitional feel. It leads Eternal Tapestry to an outlet where they can shed the tags with which they're so often saddled, but not to a place where they're reaching far beyond that into the ether.</span></p></div>"|20236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20236-wild-strawberries/|6.2|Nick Neyland

Singer Alex Luciano and drummer Noah Bowman met at a house show when she interrupted a set to ask him for a lighter; a few months later, they were playing shows and getting ready to record their first songs at a studio in New Paltz. <i>Over Easy</i>, their debut EP, is the product of that labor, a collection of brisk, personal pop-punk that recalls '90s bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"">Beat Happening</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24168-tiger-trap/"">Tiger Trap</a> in its simplicity and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28243-eternal-summers/"">Eternal Summers</a> in its tone.</p>
<p>It's not hard to get to the core of the songs on <i>Over Easy</i>. Built mostly out of Bowman's frenzied drumming and Luciano's distorted guitar and vocals, they're simple, propulsive, and monochromatic; they're dense, but not rich with detail. They mostly serve as vehicles for Luciano's reflections on the life changes, relationships, and social anxiety that characterize extended adolescence. It's a time that's served as fodder for more than its share of music, but Luciano comes at it with a keen observational eye and a fresh perspective. She turns opener ""Breathless"", an anthem for people living independently for the first time, into something with character through her use of location and detail (like the fact that she's still missing a shower curtain). In other moments, she has a knack for memorable and catchy phrasing that reminds me of Dashboard Confessional, specifically the way every song threatened to break into a cathartic group singalong in a live setting. When she hammers out the line, ""and I am sweating and I'm/ betting you are, too!"" in the chorus of ""Pool Boyz"", it's easy to imagine a roomful of people yelling it with her and revelling in the song's heat and pent-up lust.</p>
<p>There are moments on <i>Over Easy </i>where Diet Cig crosses the line from relatable young adult angst into petulant, immature whining. There are pieces of ""Scene Sick"" that are appealing on their own—the way its slow shuffle explodes into a speedy romp, the nicely varied percussive elements—but when tossed together with Luciano's powdered sugar vocal, it's painfully saccharine. It's also based around a complaint that's remarkably insular, namely the oppressiveness of the titular scene; it's a sentiment that likely resonates with people who have spent a lot of time embedded in the music industry, but without that context it hews a little closer to straightforward whining. Closer ""Harvard"", fuller and funnier and more dynamic, does a better job of conveying that kind of annoyance by focusing on a snobby, jerky ex. </p>
<p>There's obvious talent and light in these songs, though it's also obvious that Diet Cig are still in their infancy. (In spending time with the EP, I kept coming back to Eternal Summers' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvNmz8FJfUk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lightswitch""</a> as a best case scenario for songs of this length and complexity: more colour, more depth, more space, more intensity.) There's promise here, but <i>Over Easy</i> barely scrapes the 10 minute mark, and the duo's next release will be the one that really proves their worth.</p></div>"|20237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20237-over-easy-ep/|6.1|Jamieson Cox

(In keeping with her first record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16449-colleen-green-milo-goes-to-compton/"" target=""_blank""><i>Milo Goes to Compton</i></a>, Green named <i>I Want To Grow Up </i>after another <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1204-descendents/"" target=""_blank"">Descendents</a> album.) On this record, Green has managed to capture in very real and human terms the existential terror that everything is futile and that our lives will never amount to much: no small feat. She is keenly aware of her own limitations and has turned her reflection on those limitations into strengths.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Green’s got a knack for songwriting. While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">the Ramones</a> taught us all that we only need a few chords to make an endless number of perfect pop songs, most bands that have followed that model to the letter don’t have the ear for hooks, structure, or wordplay that their heroes did. Green does. She is also extremely effective at manipulating the studio to get the hidden depths of her seemingly simple songs—the sharks, jellyfish and other prehistoric monsters beneath the sunny surface of the beach waves—to become evident.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Deeper Than Love"", for instance, is an existential meditation on the human capacity for connection and disconnection. Driven by heavily processed bass, a metronomic drum machine, and a twinkling, haunting guitar melody, Green’s soft voice, doubled, asks persistently: ""Will I find a love that lasts as long as my life or will I die before ever becoming a wife? And I’m wondering if I’m even the marrying kind. How can I give you my life when I know you’re just gonna die?"" It is intensely claustrophobic, the kind of stream of mundane self-reflective horror that we all run away from by tapping at our phones or flipping channels. Then it turns in on itself, Green’s voice nearly a whisper as she recounts the reasons she holds potential partners at arm’s length: ""'Cause I’m shitty and I’m lame and I’m dumb and I’m a bore/ And once you get to know me you won’t like me anymore."" The coda, repeated, a shiver in the spine, guitar and synth spiraling around it: ""Further than fantasy, deeper than love ever could be."" The fear of intimacy triumphs over the fear of death.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Green isn’t complacent to just identify her problems and stare them calmly in the face, though. On the title track and the twin stars that are ""Things That Are Bad For Me (Part 1)"" and ""Things That Are Bad For Me (Part 2)"", she rhetorically kicks herself in the butt to take responsibility for her actions, whether that be getting on a proper schedule or getting away from a boyfriend who brings out the worst in her, despite her acknowledgment that her anxiety drives her bad behavior. She doesn’t just <i>want</i> to grow up—she <i>is</i> growing up, and she’s doing it in elegantly wry, acerbic, hooky pop style. Her blasé delivery might seem impenetrable at first, but there is warmth and wit to her work that rewards those who are patient enough to hear its message.</p></div>"|20235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20235-i-want-to-grow-up/|7.4|Jes Skolnik

The album recalls a time when <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O4V3jTz-Og"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">flamboyance</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-p7URVUNeQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uncouth goofiness</a> was close to the rule in indie rock, and the possibility that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"">Sade</a> would be a frequent comparison point for new, buzzworthy artists felt remote. On subsequent releases, Deacon has put lustrous new coats of paint on the noisy and ambitious electro-pop sound he prototyped on <i>Spiderman</i> (and to a lesser extent, his earlier, more overtly experimental <a href=""http://carparkrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carpark</a> releases), shifting inspiration points and performing forces, but not his fundamental aesthetic.</p>
<p>That aesthetic unites elements of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">process music</a> and primitively catchy pop, blending the two until you're not sure which is the main article. On 2009's hyper-complex, percussion-ensemble-driven <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12833-bromst/""><i>Bromst</i></a> and 2012's lush, electro-orchestral <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17094-america/""><i>America</i></a>, ""songs"" are less of a focal point: Deacon's heavily treated vocal melodies are simply kinetic layers in larger pieces. His recent return to a man-and-electronics approach—with a concise electro-disco lead single to match (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK-1axSGkXc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Feel the Lightning""</a>)—has suggested that his first LP in three years, <i>Gliss Riffer</i>, might bring hooks and lighthearted mania back to the fore.</p>
<p>However, this tidy narrative doesn't really fit. First of all, <i>Gliss Riffer</i> boasts few show-stopping choruses. Reverb and chorus effects dampen and blend his synth and 808 patterns, creating the illusion of organic space and gradation where, once, all was coarse, brittle and vacuum-sealed. More than a return-to-form album, <i>Gliss Riffer</i> simply feels like an exploration of a more pared-back, intuitive way of working.</p>
<p>One of the things which has always made Deacon's music divisive is the difficulty of knowing what, exactly, he's ""going for."" Crude summaries vary—is this rave music for the DIY-house-show set? Avant-garde electronica? Performance art? Minimalism? Maximalism? The confusion is a testament to how over-stimulating his music can be. It's hard to decide where to focus when listening. At his finest, most expansive moments, Deacon renders this dilemma beside the point, but on <i>Gliss Riffer</i>, it's hard to avoid it; the battle between song and arrangement is staged in too small of an arena. Sometimes both seem to be vying for the spotlight without either one seeming totally worthy, as in the robotic new-wave of ""Mind on Fire"" or the facile electro-punk of ""Sheathed Wings"".</p>
<p>As on any of Deacon's albums, it's the moments where he seems to be on the cusp of discovering something new that prove the most exciting. ""Take It to the Max"" sounds like Deacon coming out on the other side of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and <a href=""http://pcmusic.info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PC Music</a>. Opening like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>'s <i>Drumming</i>:<i> </i>Windows 95 edition, the amazingly detailed and constantly mutating piece builds powerfully, its second half bolstered by synth-horn chorales, high, expressive woodwinds and glottal vocal noises. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> synths interwoven through the decidedly funky ""Meme Generator"" create an unusually mellow atmosphere for Deacon, and ""Steely Blues"" is bookended by sections of glacial, arrhythmic synth ambience. He's not reinventing any wheel, but these road tests of new textures are enjoyable and occasionally exceptional.</p>
<p>By Deacon's <a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/02/dan-deacon-weird-transparency/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">own account</a>, the phrase ""gliss riffer"" refers to his penchant for manipulating loops of layered <i>glissando</i> (rapid ascending and/or descending streams of sequential notes). The title functions as a self-effacing joke, but also evokes the album's straightforwardness of purpose: ""This is what I do, I know what I do, and I have fun doing it."" A more cynical interpretation would be ""Look, more of the same."" The latter characterization would be unfair, but by not making a point of challenging his instincts, Deacon nonetheless fails to climb to new heights. </p></div>"|20279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20279-gliss-riffer/|7.2|Winston Cook-Wilson

On vicious opener ""Annihilation Affair"", the quartet wallops a short, simple theme, in unison, at mid-tempo and very high volume. Frontman Steve Brooks barks his words, delivering them like marching orders as an enemy approaches: ""Know it, build it, grow it, blow it,"" he shouts, the band surging behind him. The action eventually grinds to a dissonant halt, the guitars feeding back and screaming against the beat like a long train trying to brake before slipping into hell. After seeming so eager to capitalize on their pop underpinnings in recent years, Torche arrive on <i>Restarter, </i>their <a href=""www.relapse.com"">Relapse</a> debut, as harsh, heavy and mean as they have been in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Since the release of the head-turning 2008 shout-along <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12020-meanderthal/""><i>Meanderthal</i></a>, and the subsequent dismissal of guitarist Juan Montoya,<i> </i>Torche have not been shy about their melodic enthusiasm. Recorded as a trio, the eight-track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14612-songs-for-singles/""><i>Songs for Singles</i></a> aimed to cram captivating hooks into rock tunes t<span>hat ran anywhere from 52 seconds to more than six minutes</span>. After adding guitarist Andrew Elstner, they cut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16533-harmonicraft/""><i>Harmonicraft</i></a>, a record whose cover of furry beasts holding chocolate-chip cookies and puking rainbows portended their most brisk and ebullient batch of songs yet. Torche were still plenty demanding, but the harmonies were brighter and the guitars both quicker and slicker. The metal at their core had started to melt; the big refrains and the bigger sound began to collapse into one another, producing diminishing tension. <i>Harmonicraft</i> felt transitional, putting Torche perhaps one album away from a package tour with retro-rock hawkers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27852-free-energy/"">Free Energy</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4675-wolfmother/"">Wolfmother</a>.</p>
<p>But <i>Restarter</i> push Torche back toward the more punishing pole of its sound. The brief ""Undone"", for instance, counts as one of the heaviest pieces in Torche's catalog. Brooks leads multiple marching sections, but when he pauses, they slip into the sort of down-tuned, instrumental slogs that consumed multi-minute chunks of their early records. This allows Torche to be brutal while still moving, a trick they've rarely mastered. This doesn't mean they've suddenly slid into doom or sludge metal. These 10 songs are actually no less memorable than those on <i>Harmonicraft</i>; ""Minions"", ""Blasted"", and ""Undone"" rank as new shoo-ins for any hypothetical best-of-Torche collection.</p>
<p>This time, though, Torche achieve magnetism as a band that lumbers and roars in unison, instead of manic, flashy guitars or songs that seem in a hurry to reach an end. Bassist Jonathan Nuñez and drummer Rick Smith are essential like never before. They trace Brooks and Elstner closely, fortifying every melody and movement with powerful, unselfish playing. Brooks' seesaw singing during ""Annihilation Affair"", for instance, sticks because of how the bass and drums reinforce every note. Like the best songs from <i>Meanderthal</i>,<i> </i>""Loose Men"" is agile but strong, lovable but aggressive. Its rhythm section is a juggernaut, but it moves gracefully around a guitar solo, like an elephant tap-dancing in a small room. During ""Minions"", incisive guitar lines and Brooks' monotone singing crisscross like a game of cat's cradle; Nuñez and Smith pulse behind the action, offering the equivalent of a house beat, pushing you along with the song. ""Blasted"" is one of <i>Restarter</i>'s quickest songs, its racing tempo and vocals recalling <i>Harmonicraft</i>. But the rhythm section remains the bulwark beneath it, not making room for the band's pop-rock maneuvers so much as forcing them to fight for space and attention. Brooks sings of lascivious men and scenes that seem stolen from<i> The Fast and the Furious</i>. The band pushes you along for the ride.</p>
<p><i>Restarter</i> is Torche's first album since Brooks reunited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32174-floor/"">Floor</a>, the band's predecessor in terms of style and personnel. It seems as if, in rebooting that old act, he remembered the root of the formula for both: Write catchy songs and play them at undeniable volumes, no gimmicks or flourishes necessary. On <i>Restarter</i>, that precept again takes the lead, and Torche have made their most compelling record since <i>Meanderthal</i>.</p></div>"|20046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20046-restarter/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

<p>What it's missing in ragged edges, the band's sixth studio album makes up for in force. Matt Bayles produced the record, and part of the change in mood comes from the strange way he slots Paternoster's guitar. He's more of a metal guy, having worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2699-mastodon/"" target=""_blank"">Mastodon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4785-russian-circles/"" target=""_blank"">Russian Circles</a>; in his hands, Screaming Females' frayed chords clump up into solid blocks. Rather than a backbone, King Mike's basslines feel more like walls enclosing the whole sound into a smaller space. At times, the songs sound choked by the professionalism of their own treatment.<br> <br> Though her voice falls lower in the mix this time, Paternoster still pounds home powerhouses like ""Empty Head"", whose chorus packs a blunt and heavy punch. But she's dropped the sneer on the edge of her words. On <i>Ugly</i>'s ""Rotten Apple"", she sings the line ""I'm a rotten apple"" six times at every chorus, and each one feels bound up in a new irony. Her singing remains skilled and idiosyncratic, but on <i>Rose Mountain</i>, she plays things straight. Even her lyrics lose some of their sense of play; on ""Wishing Well"", Paternoster imagines the titular change receptacle as a portal straight to hell, a clunky image compared to, say, Kim Deal's lean, evocative turn of phrase (""spitting in a wishing well"") on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpoqzt2EHaA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cannonball""</a>.<br> <br> Even when <i>Rose Mountain</i> addresses sickness directly, its tone keeps closer to the ennui of a waiting room thick with the smell of hand sanitizer than the stifled pain of a blood draw in the exam room. On ""Ripe"", Paternoster sings, ""Peel the skin raw/ Pinch till the feeling's gone,"" while the instrumentation around her—the stifled distortion, the clipped drums—sounds more numbing than painful.<br> <br> They're still young, but Screaming Females have carved out their own corner in this century's take on guitar rock. It's hard to fault them for going clean, but it's easy to miss the happy accidents they stumbled upon when they weren't so worried about keeping within the lines. For an album about how bodies can betray us with their chaos, <i>Rose Mountain</i> sounds remarkably groomed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|20197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20197-rose-mountain/|6.7|Sasha Geffen

It is also the name of 20-year-old French-Cuban duo Naomi and Lisa-Kaindé Díaz. Currently based in Paris, Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi grew up on both sides of the Atlantic. Their father was Cuban <i>conguero</i> and master percussionist Miguel ""Angá"" Díaz of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/132482-Irakere"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Irakere</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6333-buena-vista-social-club/"">Buena Vista Social Club</a>. Díaz passed away when Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi were only 11, and their older sister Yanira followed him seven years later. But the sisters have taken up their legacies via their own music and their family's shared beliefs in Regla de Ocha. Regla de Ocha, also known as Santería, is a widely practiced Afro-Cuban religion based on the worship of orishas, which have roots in West African Yoruba culture. Musically, Ibeyi ground themselves firmly within these traditions, but they weave them together with jazz, soul, hip-hop, and downtempo/electronica. The result is their deeply evocative self-titled debut.</p>
<p>In many ways, <i>Ibeyi</i> is an extended ritual—a consecration of life and love, both past and present. Fittingly, the album opens with a Yoruba prayer to Eleggua, the gatekeeper of crossroads and pathways, whose blessing alone allows ceremonies to proceed. The presence of Eleggua and other orishas saturates the album, thematically and musically. In ""River"", for example, Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi pray to Oshun, the orisha of rivers and fertility. As the song begins, a bass-heavy drum beat churns through a slow-moving current of looped ""ah""s, and Lisa-Kaindé intones, ""Carry away my dead leaves/ Let me baptize my soul with the help of your waters/ Sink my pains and complaints/ Let the river take them—"" she chokes up, ""—river, drown them!"" The track feels monumental; this is, after all, a call for rebirth. Yet, upon stripping away the vocals and reverb, it becomes apparent that the only other instruments involved are a MIDI controller (or two) and the occasional smattering of piano. And that's exactly what makes Ibeyi so remarkable. Instrumentally, their music is sparse. But it always feels full, with emotion and the kind of spirituality that is as deep as the people and circumstances that created it.</p>
<p>And so it makes sense that<i> Ibeyi </i>is teeming with ghosts. Most prominent among them, of course, is their father's. On ""Think of You"", the sisters sample Angá's drumming, which fades in and out, specter-like, during the refrains when his daughters list the things that remind them of him (laughter, walking on rhythm, etc.). On ""Mama Says"", he resurfaces in the frustrations Lisa-Kaindé expresses as she sees her mother struggle to find meaning in life after his death. And during the chant break, she and Naomi pray to Eleggua, who was their father's orisha.</p>
<p>Vocally, Lisa at times channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Nina+Simone"">Nina Simone</a>, and in her higher register, she can even recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a> circa ""Wuthering Heights"". Her ability to imbue deep emotion and otherworldliness into simple lyrics, meanwhile, is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>-like. Naomi, in turn, explores the ways that Yoruba tradition and contemporary rhythms can meet. It's not quite what her father did on <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/echu-mingua"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his last project</a>, in which he fused Afro-Cuban music with jazz and hip-hop, but they both move from the same impulse. Naomi will sometimes play hip-hop beats on cajón, or add electronic booms and claps that thunder through a track like ""Oya"", in reference to the song's namesake—Oyá, the orisha of storms and cemeteries.</p>
<p>The texts and subtexts in <i>Ibeyi</i> keep unfolding, but it feels immediate and direct regardless of how much of that text the listener is familiar with. Part of that is the nature of the language: Ibeyi do not just sing <i>about</i> their father, or Yanira, or once-lovers, or the orishas; they sing <i>to</i> them. By and large, they sing in terms of ""me,"" ""you,"" and ""we,"" and at times, the lines between those entities are blurred. Which means that we are automatically implicated, living with them, or at least standing very nearby.</p>
<p>If there is a critique to make, it's that the production can at times feel too smoothed over. Some of <a href=""http://www.mondomix.com/news/ibeyi-afro-soul-sisters"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the rougher edges</a> and raw(er) emotion that got the twins noticed in the first place get ironed out a bit. And one side effect is that a few of the album's final tracks sound somewhat similar in tonality, tempo, and their vibe. But Ibeyi still find subtle ways to create shape, as in the single piano key that pulses like a heart monitor in ""Yanira"", their song to their late sister, or the chilling dissonance in the twins' harmonies throughout.</p>
<p>By the end of the album, Naomi and Lisa-Kaindé come full circle to face themselves, ending as they began: with a prayer. This time, it is to their namesake, Ibeyi. It is a joyful moment. And it is also, as every debut album attempts to but doesn't always succeed in being, a declaration of self.</p></div>"|20270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20270-ibeyi/|7.4|Minna Zhou

The style—called Moombahton— quickly resonated beyond the nation’s capital. The style's signature is a decelerated blend of Latin-infused techno that Nada conceived at a house party in Maryland. As the story goes, the kids there were playing reggaeton and bachata when he arrived, not at all aligned with the fast-paced EDM Nada planned to spin. So he slowed </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N1OQvJ5v2k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Afrojack remix of Silvio Ecomo &amp; Chuckie’s ""Moombah""</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> to 108 beats-per-minute ""and that’s when shit popped the fuck off,"" Nada </span><a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2010/03/05/dave-nada-creator-of-moombahton-interview-mp3s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said a year later</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">.

As one-half of </span><a href=""http://nadastrom.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nadastrom</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> with production partner Matt Nordstrom, Nada and Nordstrom’s first EP—2008’s </span><i>Pussy</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">—was an easy electro-house offering that didn’t fully tap into the duo’s creative well. The bounce kept the party going, but it ultimately felt too thin for long-term enjoyment.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">For </span><i>Nadastrom</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, Nada and Nordstrom’s full-length debut, the two move to a richer sound better suited for headphone listening than the dance floor. Sure, Moombahton sounds good when you’re sipping drinks in D.C.’s U Street Music Hall, but there’s only so many ways to contort the same two-step rhythms before they feel redundant. Perhaps influenced by their 2010 move to Los Angeles, there’s a prevalent West Coast vibe throughout </span><i>Nadastrom</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, which resembles more of a woozy <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> aesthetic than a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10892-pitbull/"" target=""_blank"">Pitbull</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> retread. Vestiges of Moombahton emerge on </span><i>Nadastrom</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> track ""Headed Home"", but it gives way quickly to a psychedelic pulse.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">To that end, Nadastrom’s music doesn’t really force you to dance; instead, it gradually pulls you in with warm synthesizers that billow above thick bass drums. </span><i>Nadastrom</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is mostly instrumental, yet when the producers use vocals, they hide them behind dense, amorphous melodies to keep their soundtrack at the forefront. </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/nadastrom/somebody"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Somebody""</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is a standard EDM tune until halfway in, when muffled chants calmly emerge to accentuate a foggy rhythm. The same goes for ""Fallen Down"", except the words are indecipherable, crystallizing the track’s surrealism. </span></p>
<p><span>With ""Phantom Eyes"", the album’s otherworldly centerpiece, the song pivots between singer RYAT’s ghostly howls and the producers’ shape-shifting composition, none of which comes together as a straightforward arrangement. It’s an intriguing tug-of-war that stands alone, though it works best within the scope of the full LP. In a good way, there aren’t many standouts on </span><i>Nadastrom</i><span>, which, like the producers’ mythical DJ sets, falls into a nocturnal haze before it gently fades away. It’s a recording you have to play front to back to fully appreciate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Of course, it isn’t entirely perfect: ""Hide the Advisement"", a thin loop near the album’s center, sort of comes and goes as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> clone. ""Medium Redeye"" starts off in an interesting way, but its distorted mantra (""I’m gonna make this work/ I’m gonna figure this out"") and patchwork instrumental quickly grows stale, especially since its situated between highlights ""In the Air"" (Pt 1 and 2), featuring singer </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32241-jesse-boykins-iii/"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Boykins III</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, near the album’s end. Still, it’s not enough to dampen </span><i>Nadastrom</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’s vibe. As with their geographical shift, Nada and Nordstrom tread new sonic ground and seem comfortable in fresh surroundings. </span></p></div>"|20128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20128-nadastrom/|7.4|Marcus J.

Alas, in the six years that have elapsed since their previous outing as the King Khan &amp; BBQ Show, we’ve seen that even the most lax, non-committal unions can turn tense, with the duo cutting ties after a series of onstage blowups in 2010. And perhaps, not coincidentally, post-breakup, each has ventured further afield from their garage-rock base: Sultan with his eclectic double-album set <i>Whatever I Want/Whenever I Want</i>, Khan with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18448-king-khan-and-the-shrines-idle-no-more/""><i>Idle No More</i></a>, his regal 2013 outing with long-time backing band the Shrines. Their inevitable reunion effort, <i>Bad News Boys</i>, thus functions as a form of couples therapy: a reminder of shared values to get them back on the same page again. And, naturally, that page is still covered in blood, spit, sweat, and other bodily fluids best left to a forensics team to verify.</p>
<p>While all King Khan &amp; BBQ Show albums to date have been built from the same rudiments—Khan’s rasp, Sultan’s croon, two frayed-string guitars, and a ceaseless sleigh-belled stomp so steady, you’d swear it’s a click track—2009’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13484-invisible-girl/""><i> Invisible Girl</i></a> saw them tightening up their songcraft and, if not totally scrub up their sound, at least attempt to squeegee the surface-layer soot. With <i>Bad News Boys</i>, however, the duo jump back into the deep fryer where they cooked up 2006’s extra-greasy <i>What’s for Dinner?</i>, the album that saw these two vets join younger comrades like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"">Jay Reatard</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"">the Black Lips</a> on the frontlines of the umpteenth garage-rock revival. Recorded in Sultan’s Berlin home with just two microphones, <i>Bad News Boys </i>delivers exactly what you’d expect: more crudely rendered songs about zombies and food (or, more specifically, what happens when the latter doesn’t agree with you), doled out according to pre-established rations: There’s the paisley-pop flashbacks (""Illuminations"", ""Kiss My Sister’s Fist""), the church-pew R&amp;B (""Ocean of Love""), the goofy novelty single (""Snackin’ After Midnight""), the puerile hardcore throwback (""D.F.O.""—as in ""diarrhea, fuck off""), and another pair of winsome belt-’em-out ballads (""Buy Bye Bhai"", ""Never Felt Like This"") to join the likes of ""Why Don’t You Lie"" and ""Third Ave."" on your prom slow-dance card.</p>
<p>But the question of whether you need another record like this is ultimately answered by the fact that Khan and Sultan play like <i>they</i> need it, barreling through these 12 songs with audible smiles on their faces and a reinvigorated sense of camaraderie. And while the composition of <i>Bad News Boys</i> adheres to a tried ‘n’ true formula, the songs here consistently yield charming little details, like the bouncing baritone harmony that serves as a secondary percussion track on Khan’s ""Illuminations"", or the honey-sweet middle eight that emerges from the psychotic-reactive crunch of ""When Will I Be Tamed?"" or the quote from Hendrix’s meditative ""Third Stone From the Sun"" that turns up amid the cartoonish, cannibalistic anarchy of ""Snackin’ After Midnight"". Khan and Sultan may be devout rock'n'roll traditionalists at heart, but their deft balance of sweetness and insolence remains distinctly their own. When the heart-rending jangle-pop of ""Never Felt Like This"" gets rudely upended by the cantankerous closer ""Zen Machines""—a sort-of juke-joint update of the Suicidal Tendencies’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoF_a0-7xVQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Institutionalized""</a>, with the Pepsi product placement swapped for puzzling Conan O’Brien shout-outs—it feels less like a willful act of self-destruction than a rightful restoring of order in the King Khan &amp; BBQ universe.</p></div>"|20232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20232-bad-news-boys/|7.0|Stuart Berman

But their first three albums, especially 1989's <i>Earwig</i> and 1990's <i>Sunburn</i> (and 1991's <i>Rosy Jack World</i> EP), were on constant rotation for a certain frustrated New Jersey teen: Hatfield's angsty lyrics and crystalline voice, the ramshackle instrumentation and perfect hooks; the reference to William Blake (via Allen Ginsberg, no less); the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17298-iggy-and-the-stooges/"">Stooges</a> covers, that they shaved their hair and cut their fingers in their videos and wrote a song about the life-saving effect of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>. They felt like your peers, and part of your underground, but were also clearly further along than you were.</p>
<p>Hatfield was the one doing most of the singing, and stood front and center in the press photos, so when she went solo in 1992 with <i>Hey Babe</i>, it made sense. Despite her blue-black hair on the cover, that record felt like a continuation of Blake Babies—it included a revved-up electric version of ""Nirvana"" and a song co-written with Strohm. The same goes for 1993's <i>Become What You Are</i>, which found Hatfield on guitar with bassist Dean Fisher and drummer Todd Philips as the Juliana Hatfield Three. The personnel was different, but it felt like part of a whole.</p>
<p>Now, after 13 solo albums (the last being 2013's <i>Wild Animals</i>), work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4132-some-girls/"">Some Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31806-minor-alps/"">Minor Alps</a>, and a briefly reunited Blake Babies, Hatfield has rejoined Fisher and Philips for <i>Whatever, My Love</i>, a record billed as ""the first Juliana Hatfield Three album in over 21 years."" Which, yeah, technically, it is. Fans at the time, though, saw Philips playing drums with Hatfield on the <i>Hey Babe</i> tour, and the distinction of ""solo"" versus full band didn't register. After all, that first solo album featured contributions from Philips (on most of the songs) along with contributions from Blake Babies regular Evan Dando, John Wesley Harding, Mike Watt, and others. What <i>Become What You Are</i> had, though, were Hatfield's biggest hits. It featured <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUAVbGoR81I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Spin the Bottle""</a> (also on the <i>Reality Bites</i> soundtrack) and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siJZXTuwBjA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""My Sister""</a>, and that's what the ""getting the band back together"" storyline is supposed to remind you of here. Because, outside of a lauded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a> cover last year, there haven't been any real hits since then.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning, too, because Hatfield recorded that last solo album <i>Wild Animals</i> by herself: she played every instrument and produced it. She took the same solitary approach on 2010's coffee house collection, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13862-peace-love/""><i>Peace &amp; Love</i></a>. Throughout her career, Hatfield's strongest work's emerged when she's clicked with her collaborators. She made magic with the Blake Babies. And she made magic with Fisher and Philips. So, for longtime fans, <i>Whatever, My Love</i> gives reason for optimism. And, of the album, Hatfield's said: ""We haven’t totally reinvented the wheel or anything."" Which is what you want to hear. She goes back to her earlier timeless sound, one that emerged from punk, and skips the saccharine singer-songwriter stuff.</p>
<p>Wrapped in very '90s cover art, <i>Whatever</i> opens with the breezy ""Invisible"", a track that starts almost <i>in medias res</i> and sounds like it could've easily been written during the older, prime period. And, you know, <i>it was</i>. I listened to <i>Whatever</i> a number of times before learning that my favorites—""Invisible"", the excellent first single ""If I Could"", and ""Now That I Have Found You""—were all songs she wrote in the mid-to-late-'90s. They were demos previously, and only given the full studio treatment now. They have the classic guitar tone, and a kind of effortlessness to the hooks. Another standout is ""I'm Shy"", a lite rocker that reminds me of the Blake Babies cover of ""Loose"", featuring straightforward, sharp lyrics about, well, being shy. These could've showed up on any of those older records and been standouts.</p>
<p>That effortlessness is harder to locate on the stiffer, less distinctive material. These are leaden, relatively tuneless songs like ""Push Pin"" (which, oddly, feels like a soft post-punk <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4208-they-might-be-giants/"">They Might Be Giants</a> outtake), ""Blame the Stylist"", ""Dog on a Chain"", ""I Don't Know What to Do With My Hands"" (which does have a good synth-accompanied bridge), ""Wood"" (which sounds like wood), and ""If Only We Were Dogs"", a silly song that was somehow chosen to be a single (complete with unfortunate <a href=""https://vimeo.com/119780232"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a>). These tend to go nowhere and feel longer than they actually are. (The way the album's sequenced, you get you a bunch of the duds in a row, making me think an EP of the six stronger tracks would've made more sense. Especially because the catchy mid-tempo closer, ""Parking Lots"", has plenty of charm and smart wordplay.)</p>
<p>On a whole, <i>Whatever</i> is milder and gentler than the darker <i>Become What You Are</i>; that comes with age, I guess. But, all said, it does feel like a return. It's more propulsive than Hatfield's other recent work; it's more alive. You can hear this music existing in the world, making sense away from the studio, and connecting with people. It also sounds like the most fun she's had making a record in a while, and at times, reminds me why we hung Blake Babies posters on our walls when we were younger.</p></div>"|20180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20180-whatever-my-love/|6.1|Brandon Stosuy

But at some point, Bromley decided that sparse acoustic music bored her, so Twin River upstreamed to a bright-toned, swaggering synth-rock outfit. Their debut, <i>Should the Light Go Out</i>, savvily punches a few major stylistic buttons—poppy, swaggering, vaguely retro. Bromley has a great voice—sharp and dark-toned and instantly memorable—the sort that feels designed to cut through thick power chords. And they have a sure hand crafting tuneful rock songs, a couple of which (""Laugh It Off"", ""Bend to Break"") cheerfully arm-wrestle you into first-listen submission.</p>
<p>The album <i>sounds</i> nice, in an immediate and familiar way: the crunch of the punky melodic guitars on ""Bend to Break"", the clean, starlit twinkles of synthesizer on ""He’s Not Real and He Ain’t Coming Back"". <i>Should the Light Go Out</i> is alluringly coated in reverb, so that the whole album sounds smeared rather than recorded, with Bromley’s voice stirring into the mix like brown sugar thickening water. But reverb is much like corn syrup: Put too much corn syrup in a drink and it tastes like corn syrup. Put too much reverb on an album and it tastes like reverb. Too many of <i>Should the Light</i>’s 10 songs just taste like reverb.</p>
<p>The blurry sense of distance tames some otherwise jagged, exciting rock songs into a pleasant air-conditioner hum. On ""Word to the Wise"", Bromley scoops notes in a low, guttural register, which are difficult to hear, and the zigzagging, flange’d guitar solo that drives the song to its peak sounds as faraway as a car crash on a muted TV news broadcast. The pogoing ""Anything Goes"" feels similarly sapped. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7noN5ZfWI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_SainnHkYs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clips</a> of Twin River reveal a much more dynamic band, with a hint of Nashville twang and soul-rock heat that can’t really be discerned here. The closest we get is the slow 6/8 shuffle ""It Won’t Be Long"", which offers a chance for Bromley to belt, and lean into the whooping ""drinkin’ alone"" chorus.</p>
<p>Twin River the soulful, mainstream pop-rock band, which keeps threatening to break out of the record, is far more interesting than Twin River the au-courant synth-rock band, which takes up more space than it should. Some of the songs are so atmospheric and cool-sounding they almost forget to exist: The slow, deliberate ""Golden Man"", which helps itself to nine full minutes, brings to mind a leather jacket, maybe someone walking slowly, and the beat to ""Be My Baby"". It is difficult to tell if someone also wrote a song in there.</p>
<p>Again, the culprit here might (partly) be reverb. Bromley, from the same CBC interview: ""I had this long saga in my head, lyrically, and there was nothing I could get rid of. I said, 'Sorry guys, we have to have six verses.'"" Without the ability to parse nearly any of the song’s six verses, however, the song becomes an interminable, unchanging vista.

Its aesthetic—part-chillwave, part-shoegaze—felt like a wistful backdrop for Wham!-era George Michael or Jamiroquai frontman Jay Kay without the standout vocals. Ward seemed content hiding his words behind thick layers of coffee-shop acid jazz and old-school R&amp;B. Though he updated these sounds, the result was tentative; debut albums should make bold statements, and Ward’s direction was unclear.</p>
<p>For <i>Parodia</i> follow-up <i>Rapture</i>, Ward has cut back the haze, showing a more vocally assured presence as he ponders broken romance. His newfound confidence is ironic, given the record’s lovelorn premise: When your heart aches, you generally don’t want to discuss what happened or how you contributed to the mess. You want to sit somewhere alone, just you and your thoughts and a few Roberta Flack records. Throughout <i>Rapture</i>, Ward asks sensitive questions that will feel familiar to anyone who has loved hard enough.</p>
<p>He openly explores his hurt on <i>Rapture</i>, and it’s obvious he’s still searching for a resolution. ""Could I have changed the things that stopped it?"" he ponders on ""Hunger"". ""How did I get to feel so helpless?"" ""How can you let go?/Give it time"", he decides on album closer ""Not Enough"". His words are more prominent than anything on <i>Parodia</i>, reflecting the scattered musings of a man clinging to the past while trying to figure out how to move on. ""I’m through telling all these lies,"" he croons midway through <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">the title track</span>. ""Love is a hard thing to capture, when you keep it all inside.""</p>
<p>At its core, <i>Rapture</i> details Ward’s quest for understanding and his eventual resignation. There’s an overwhelming sense of isolation that you feel in its hollow production and barely-there ballads, the spacious electro-soul supporting Ward's despondent whimpers of regret. <i>Rapture</i> conjures an atmosphere of confessional intimacy: You can imagine Ward sitting by himself at a piano, notepad in hand, culling torment from a house that once held affection.</p>
<p>In the album's second half, the music breaks down and becomes more abstruse as Ward gains personal clarity. Transitional tracks like ""Perfume Kinship"", ""Gloria"" and ""Torrents of Spring"" recall the abstract approach of <i>Parodia</i>, but with a decidedly sexier feel. Overall, <i>Rapture</i> is a decent step forward for Ward, one that shows his progression as a composer, but without enough variation, the album grows sappy over repeated plays. Heartbreak records, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a>'s downtrodden 2002 opus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/617-sea-change/""><i>Sea Change</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/""><i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i></a>, need some central magnetism to keep pulling you back. <i>Rapture</i>’s nocturnal R&amp;B plays well enough at moderate volume, but the grief-stricken mood becomes a bit stale without noteworthy tunes to revisit. <i><i>Rapture</i></i> is ultimately an honest effort devoid of staying power.</p></div>"|20183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20183-rapture/|6.7|Marcus J.

Fronted by David Tattersall, a sharp songwriter with crafty rhymes and a bullied-schoolboy vibrato, the trio has subsisted on the periphery of British indie for over a decade. While they hew to a one-take, soundbites-and-solos setup, their frequent output has been diverse enough to keep you checking in: Last year they released two quietly charming records, a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5748-herman-dune/"">Herman Dune</a>’s Stanley Binks and a full-LP cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"">Daniel Johnston</a>’s <i>Artistic Vice</i>. </span><i>Great Big Flamingo Burning Moon</i> is roughly their 16th album, their gnarliest yet, and it’s another collaboration, this one produced and co-written by beret-wearing punk <i>artiste</i> Billy <span class=""il"">Childish</span>.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Their mutual attraction figures: Both are prolific pseudo-amateurs and hail from cities outside London where punk never took off but hasn’t really died, either. Solos aside, the Wave Pictures have always cut a more modest path than forebears <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1918-hefner/"">Hefner</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a>, but <i>Great Big Flamingo</i>’s garage-rock primitivism marks the first time they’ve really glamourized their limitations. The slight redirection is likely thanks to Childish, who was expelled from art school for having ""an attitude of total rejection"" and has since devoted his life to demystifying the pompous institutions of modern art and music. The single ""Pea Green Coat"" (punning on <a href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nonsense_Songs,_Stories,_Botany,_and_Alphabets/The_Owl_and_the_Pussycat"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a line</a> by nonsense poet Edward Lear) is not unlike a Childish painting, nailing a couple of neat memories—the bustling station, the garish coat in a sea of suits—to capture an alluring fragment.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That’s a highlight, and there are a few. Listening to songs like ""Fake Fox Fur Pillowcase"" and ""All the Birds Lined Up Dot Dot Dot"" is like reading an interesting person’s notebook with every second page ripped out. On the brilliantly hare-brained ""Frogs Sing Loudly in the Ditches"", any pretence towards plot vanishes, as if the notebook had been torn up in a huff and then hopelessly reassembled: ""It’s raining champagne but I’m struggling to breathe/ You can hold them in your hand, that’s why they call them palm trees."" Elsewhere, the bluesy riffs and relentlessly sparing observations wear thin. ""The Fire Alarm"", for one, darts poetically between ""polka dot shorts"" and a ""peppermint tongue"" without tying the loose visuals together. ""Sinister Purpose"" and ""Green River"", back-to-back <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8318-creedence-clearwater-revival/"">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> covers included at Childish’s behest, might have benefited from an attitude of total rejection.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Much of the record’s activity occurs at a distance, drifting from the street and up through the window, and Tattersall casts the same curious eye on buzzing insects and street sounds as his own vague exploits. It would be misleading to separate plot from scene-setting, because often it's unclear which is which. Sometimes the domestic and external worlds merge sweetly–take the Larkin-like breeze that ""whistles like a kettle"" in ""At Dusk You Took Down the Blinds"". But later in the song, over plaintive Sunday-morning strums, Tattersall simply sends characters drifting between candlelit rooms. ""We curl up like hedgehogs/ And whisper to one another,"" he teases in the chorus, but the content of those whispers is left hanging, and not in an appealing or enigmatic way. His style seems to be: What happened happened, and that’s that.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The best track here, ""We Fell Asleep in the Blue Tent"" tells a fleeting, straightforward love story over meandering bass and punk-club guitar stabs. Tattersall describes ""moths all dancing underneath the streetlight, kids drinking cider in the shadows,"" before walking up with his companion for ""paracetamol, pineapple juice and that first cigarette."" It’s funny, pinpoint-sharp, and smartly evocative enough that Childish would probably consider it an irredeemable sell-out. But truthfully, <i>Great Big Flamingo Burning Moon</i> could use more songs like it. As it is, the album feels slightly cluttered by a surfeit of dry minutiae that calls for a cutting room floor of its own.</span></p></div>"|20249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20249-great-big-flamingo-burning-moon/|5.9|Jazz Monroe

I<span>t’s not enough to simply press ""Record"" and play</span>: If you’re going to issue an onstage set, you’d better make sure that the band behind you is rehearsed, that your catalog is fit to be culled, and that every factor in the room, from the amplifiers to the engineer capturing it all, is ready to be immortalized.</p>
<p>What’s more, the band had better be prepared to be more than a mere traveling karaoke machine. If they can’t add some new element or interpretation to the tunes, why bother with a two-dimensional reproduction of something that happened in front of a three-dimensional audience? This troublesome sub-category has produced <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-rust-mw0000195375"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some incredible</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheap_Trick_at_Budokan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">urgent records</a>, but during the past five decades, it has also built a monumental morass of between-album stopgaps, a wasteland of records that mostly remind you a band you like still exists. Live records, then, can be as functionally unnecessary as the carbon filler used to turn virgin vinyl black—there to keep up appearances, if little else.</p>
<p><i>Live at the Music Hall,</i> an exhaustive hour-and-a-half, three-LP, career-crossing set from Phosphorescent, falls somewhere in between these extremes. Recorded during a four-night stand at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn nine months after the release of 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17522-phosphorescent-muchacho/""><i>Muchacho</i></a>, the album attempts to meet the extra pressures of the official live format. Surrounded by a six-piece that features drums <i>and</i> auxiliary percussion, stopping for an intimate solo acoustic section, and adding a string quartet on ""Song for Zula"", Matthew Houck works to turn <i>Live at the Music Hall</i> into more than a mere document of another gig. The band recharges ""Dead Heart"", an old organ-and-acoustic dirge, with the neon-light electricity of Crazy Horse. They turn up the volume for a closing 10-minute version of ""Los Angeles"", where Houck screams and the drummer rolls and the pianist pounds until the air of desolation becomes an exorcism. And they amplify the space-cowboy glee of ""Ride On/Right On"", with Houck smiling audibly through the playful wah-wah pedal and calypso organ.</p>
<p>But the six-piece around Houck is more competent than combustible, a quality that’s long made Phosphorescent a good band to see for a 90-minute show but not one that makes you need to take them home. Phosphorescent was, for years, a crew powered by instability, where players would fall into and out of a fold that clearly belonged to the frontman. And no matter how many people ended up playing on them, his records were at their best when they read like personal transmissions, confessions delivered during the dead of night or from the bottom of a bottle. In recent years, though, Phosphorescent has somewhat codified its lineup, with anchors like Ricky Ray Jackson on guitar, Christopher Marine on drums and Scott Stapleton supporting with piano and harmonies. They’re all here. Still, these 19 songs make it clear that Phosphorescent remains Houck’s act. The players are there to support the songs, not to rearrange them. As a result, the musicians sometimes feel hemmed in, leashed. ""A New Anhedonia"" is heavier and more indulgent than the <i>Muchacho</i> take, but it mostly scans like the studio version sans its subtle flourishes. ""Terror in the Canyons (The Wounded Master)"", which follows, suffers the same problem. As if aware of the stasis, Houck screams the final chorus, his voice cracking in an uncontrolled eruption. For a singer who can make even the most tortured feelings sound like small talk, it’s a rare error of overexertion.</p>
<p>Indeed, the star here remains the same that it’s been for much if not all of Phosphorescent’s discography—Houck’s voice, a beautifully idiosyncratic instrument full of cracks and bumps and bruises that have always made his words feel lived-in and real. During the set’s three-song solo stretch, he’s in stunning form, whether condensing and distending the syllables in lithe little runs during ""A Picture of Our Torn Up Praise"" or harmonizing with himself and a loop pedal for the sublime close of ""Wolves"". During an organ-abetted rendition of ""Muchacho’s Tune"", he brilliantly renders the helplessness and hope of the song’s protagonist. <span>He murmurs about being fucked up and being a fool, his voice in shambles. But then he strenghtens his tone subtly, and by verse’s end, he sounds the signal of his own redemption: “I’ll fix myself up to come and be with you.” The transition gives the familiar song a fresh layer of vulnerability. </span>He's just as poignant leading the band through a full version of ""Wolves"", too, adding just enough soul-singer gusto to suggest abandon without losing control. </p>
<p><span>Phosphorescent has always indulged popular music’s great referential gestures</span>.  In 2009, that meant naming and recording <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12656-to-willie/"">a Willie Nelson tribute album</a> in the same way <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Lefty_from_Willie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nelson had done for his own hero</a>, Lefty Frizzell. In 2013, it meant using introductions and reprises to bookend <i>Muchacho</i>, a quick nod to concept albums. The spirits of Houck’s inspirations have always been a vital part of his music, too, linking his work to a strange but specific arc of predecessors that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"">Willie Nelson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Denny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandy Denny</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a>. The live album, then, seems inevitable for Phosphorescent, another tradition-steeped move in a career rich with them. It’s obvious that Houck has studied how these things should go, the requisite features that bind the best ones. At points, he even gets there, but most of those successes don’t require a six-piece band, a string quartet or a three-LP set. They just require these songs, that voice and a little air to breathe.</p></div>"|20097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20097-live-at-the-music-hall/|6.0|Grayson Haver Currin

""Rubber City Rebels"" also appears on </span><i>The Akron Compilation</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, a platter issued by England's legendary Stiff Records in 1978 in an attempt to capitalize on the growing notoriety of Akron's most infamous weirdos (and Stiff signees), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a>. But ""Rubber City Rebels"" represents Akron circa the late '70s far more passionately. Where Devo started out with a noise that was simultaneously punky and abstract, Rubber City Rebels had zero trace of art in their DNA. Their theme song says it all: Firestone's big ""fuck you"" to both coasts celebrated Ohio's flyover status and admittedly crumbling industrial infrastructure, boosting the Akron scene in much the same way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">the Stooges</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"">the MC5</a> did for Detroit a decade before in the process.</span></span></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Jazz</a> has released two new anthologies of Ohio proto-punk, punk, and post-punk from the late '70s and early '80s: <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i> (centered on Akron) and <i>Extermination Nights in the Sixth City </i>(centered on Cleveland). Of the two, <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i> has a clear blueprint in Stiff's <i>The Akron Compilation</i>. Four songs from the Stiff disc have found their way onto <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i>, but that slight overlap isn't enough to make the album redundant. Instead, the record fleshes out the portrait of Akron past. Bizarros and Rubber City Rebels blurred the line between bluesy, hard-rocking, keyboard-spiked proto-punk; in particular, Bizzaro's own slithery theme song, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aovGJpPgUp8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Bizarro""</a>, dramatizes the shift between Detroit stoner-snarl and punk's frantic animosity. And although ""Rubber City Rebel"" doesn't appear on <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i>, the group is well represented by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooYueM80mN0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kidnapped""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHDH_ZTIj5M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Such a Fool""</a>, two tracks taken from their '77 split with the Bizarros that demonstrate the no-holds-barred ethic of the time, before punk became petrified by its own image; the former is a raw, blistering spasm that predicts the coming hardcore storm, while the latter sounds as if it could be a raucous Alice Cooper demo.</p>
<p>Any Akron comp without Devo, however, would be disastrously incomplete, and <i>Burn, Rubber City, Burn!</i> includes the 1974 demos of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJcshY5ywro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mechanical Man""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZxjGiOnb1I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Auto Modown""</a>. Robotic, withdrawn, synth-twiddling, and playfully bleak, these two songs set the tone for later comp highlights such as Chi-Pig's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdmhD4MUsv0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Apu Api""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm-pkI7uHe4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ring Around the Collar""</a>. Neither would have been out of place on a contemporaneous Rough Trade comp, and members of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">Slits</a>-esque Chi-Pig would go on to co-write Devo's ""Gates of Steel"". (Mark Mothersbaugh, meanwhile, penned the lyrics for the group's ""Ring Around the Collar"".) Their presence helps pinpoint the big bang of Akron's more experimental contingent.</p>
<p>But for every gem like Jane Aire &amp; the Belvederes' ""When I Was Young""—in which Aire belts out gutsy and righteous tirades over jerky math-punk—there are oddities like ""Narrow Road"" by 15 60 75 Numbers Band—a listless, jazz-fusion meander that seems to have been listed for historical purposes only, seeing as how the group's lineup consisted, at one point or another, of Gerald Casale of Devo as well as Chrissie Hynde, an Akronite who moved to England and launched <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3485-the-pretenders/"">the Pretenders</a> just before the Akron scene took off. It's unfortunate, also, that this completist spirit didn't spill over to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"">the Cramps</a>, who recorded a definitive batch of punkabilly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwkFlgKf-1s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">demos</a> in Akron in 1979 and whose frontman Lux Interior was a native.</p>
<p>Akron has been honored with two documentaries about its punk heyday—2003's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZmUWqCjquc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>It's Everything, and Then It's Gone</i></a> and 2005's<i> </i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whhP6TtrEkM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>If You're Not Dead, Play</i></a>. Cleveland, meanwhile, has had none (with the exception of 2007's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDqEOpF4QXY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cleveland Screaming</i></a>, covering the city's '80s hardcore scene). Yet Cleveland's leading band of the era, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3284-pere-ubu/"">Pere Ubu</a>, were every bit as trailblazing as their Akron counterparts Devo. The fresh context of <i>Extermination Nights in the Sixth City</i> gives the anthology's two Pere Ubu selections—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvcsO6cYLus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heart of Darkness""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VelS-YCtHV4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Final Solution""</a>, plucked from their first two singles circa 1975 and '76—even more stark power. Leader David Thomas was still going by the ominous moniker Crocus Behemoth, and his mystique pervades these remarkable documents, which foreshadow the poetic tension and asperity of post-punk before punk itself had even solidified. Pere Ubu's predecessor, Rocket from the Tombs, gets a single song, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovwyYd8aIKw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Life Stinks""</a>, but that's all they need; the anti-anthem remains as haywire and nihilistically disjointed as the day it crawled out of Thomas' feverish brain.</p>
<p>Cleveland contained plenty of protean talent besides Pere Ubu and kin. The Dead Boys, featuring former members of Rocket from the Tombs, may have broken out of Cleveland and headed for New York's CBGB scene, but plenty other punk-rock provocateurs stayed behind and flourished like blacktop weeds. Among them were the Pagans, Cleveland's answer to Rubber City Rebels. Their pulsing, Iggy-like conniptions are represented on <i>Extermination Nights</i> by three raging tracks, most notably the garage-rock-on-glue-fumes desperation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkYdj3_7ahA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dead End America""</a>—a beer-swilling, blue-collar rallying cry in the midst of socioeconomic collapse.</p>
<p>The artist side of the Cleveland scene finds expression on <i>Extermination Nights</i>, too. The Electric Eels, trafficking in punk savagery on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9cUaRHCfog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Splittery Splat""</a> and avant-rock deconstruction on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLMpEk3F-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bunnies""</a>.

These quirks help make for a more solid, consistent listen than <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i>—a higher batting average aided by the fact that Pere Ubu's tracks here reflect some of the best and most important music the group ever created, while Devo's contributions to <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i> amount to mere marginalia.</p>
<p>Ironically, one of the most popular bands to emerge from the collective ooze of <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i> and <i>Extermination Nights in the Sixth City</i> were the Waitresses. The quirky, lackluster, blues-rock oddity ""The Comb""—which appears on both <i>The Akron Compilation</i> and <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i>—in no way prepares us for the new-wavers who eventually charted with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsneH0mOq-0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Know What Boys Like""</a>, performed the theme song to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX29YGnTq3E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Square Pegs""</a>, and were covered by the Spice Girls and on ""Glee"". Their success underlines the lack of cohesion to the Akron and Cleveland scenes. They were a free-for-all mix of inspired amateurs, ambitious opportunists, and serious, self-styled artists. In that way, Ohio wasn't all that different from any other place, then or now.</p>
<p>Still, there's an underdog pride and a furious invention to this music that unites these anthologies. The ache of doomed ambition, of a creative spirit pushed to the limit of endurance, and often well beyond, is palpable. Industrialized civilization may have been crumbling in the Rust Belt in the late '70s and early '80s, but <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i> and <i>Extermination Nights in the Sixth City</i> prove just how much decay, disenfranchisement, and the specter of encroaching dystopia can fuel the fiercest of sounds.</p></div>"|20188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20188-punk-45-extermination-nights-in-the-sixth-city-punk-45-burn-rubber-city-burn/|8.0|Jason Heller

""Rubber City Rebels"" also appears on </span><i>The Akron Compilation</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, a platter issued by England's legendary Stiff Records in 1978 in an attempt to capitalize on the growing notoriety of Akron's most infamous weirdos (and Stiff signees), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a>. But ""Rubber City Rebels"" represents Akron circa the late '70s far more passionately. Where Devo started out with a noise that was simultaneously punky and abstract, Rubber City Rebels had zero trace of art in their DNA. Their theme song says it all: Firestone's big ""fuck you"" to both coasts celebrated Ohio's flyover status and admittedly crumbling industrial infrastructure, boosting the Akron scene in much the same way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">the Stooges</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"">the MC5</a> did for Detroit a decade before in the process.</span></span></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Jazz</a> has released two new anthologies of Ohio proto-punk, punk, and post-punk from the late '70s and early '80s: <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i> (centered on Akron) and <i>Extermination Nights in the Sixth City </i>(centered on Cleveland). Of the two, <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i> has a clear blueprint in Stiff's <i>The Akron Compilation</i>. Four songs from the Stiff disc have found their way onto <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i>, but that slight overlap isn't enough to make the album redundant. Instead, the record fleshes out the portrait of Akron past. Bizarros and Rubber City Rebels blurred the line between bluesy, hard-rocking, keyboard-spiked proto-punk; in particular, Bizzaro's own slithery theme song, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aovGJpPgUp8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Bizarro""</a>, dramatizes the shift between Detroit stoner-snarl and punk's frantic animosity. And although ""Rubber City Rebel"" doesn't appear on <i>Burn Rubber City, Burn!</i>, the group is well represented by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooYueM80mN0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kidnapped""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHDH_ZTIj5M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Such a Fool""</a>, two tracks taken from their '77 split with the Bizarros that demonstrate the no-holds-barred ethic of the time, before punk became petrified by its own image; the former is a raw, blistering spasm that predicts the coming hardcore storm, while the latter sounds as if it could be a raucous Alice Cooper demo.</p>
<p>Any Akron comp without Devo, however, would be disastrously incomplete, and <i>Burn, Rubber City, Burn!</i> includes the 1974 demos of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJcshY5ywro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mechanical Man""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZxjGiOnb1I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Auto Modown""</a>. Robotic, withdrawn, synth-twiddling, and playfully bleak, these two songs set the tone for later comp highlights such as Chi-Pig's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdmhD4MUsv0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Apu Api""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm-pkI7uHe4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ring Around the Collar""</a>. Neither would have been out of place on a contemporaneous Rough Trade comp, and members of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">Slits</a>-esque Chi-Pig would go on to co-write Devo's ""Gates of Steel"". (Mark Mothersbaugh, meanwhile, penned the lyrics for the group's ""Ring Around the Collar"".) Their presence helps pinpoint the big bang of Akron's more experimental contingent.</p>
<p>But for every gem like Jane Aire &amp; the Belvederes' ""When I Was Young""—in which Aire belts out gutsy and righteous tirades over jerky math-punk—there are oddities like ""Narrow Road"" by 15 60 75 Numbers Band—a listless, jazz-fusion meander that seems to have been listed for historical purposes only, seeing as how the group's lineup consisted, at one point or another, of Gerald Casale of Devo as well as Chrissie Hynde, an Akronite who moved to England and launched <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3485-the-pretenders/"">the Pretenders</a> just before the Akron scene took off. It's unfortunate, also, that this completist spirit didn't spill over to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"">the Cramps</a>, who recorded a definitive batch of punkabilly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwkFlgKf-1s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">demos</a> in Akron in 1979 and whose frontman Lux Interior was a native.</p>
<p>Akron has been honored with two documentaries about its punk heyday—2003's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZmUWqCjquc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>It's Everything, and Then It's Gone</i></a> and 2005's<i> </i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whhP6TtrEkM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>If You're Not Dead, Play</i></a>.

From their early, kitschy new wave blasts to later PG-13 party hits like ""Love Shack"", the group’s music has always been defined by an irreverent queerness: a patchwork quilt of influences, a willingness to embrace femininity, and a surprising resilience, all fused together in the shape of a band that occupies a unique space in pop history. Pierson is one of the talented utility players that helps the band run—a multi-instrumentalist, a songwriter, and a distinctive vocalist—but hasn’t had a chance to shine on a solo basis until now: She’s releasing her first solo record, </span><i>Guitars and Microphones</i><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">, at the age of 66. (She came close a decade ago, with a whole batch of songs ready for release, but the project was scrapped as the B-52s began to work on comeback record </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11319-funplex/"" target=""_blank""><i>Funplex</i></a><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">.) It’s a project that’s been hatched with some surprising collaborators—reigning radio-pop weirdo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"" target=""_blank"">Sia</a> co-wrote and executive produced the album, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a>’ guitarist Nick Valensi plays on much of it—and perhaps the most remarkable thing about it is how conventional it sounds.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">If you spend your time with </span><i>Guitars and Microphones</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> hunting for some sonic signature on Sia’s part, you won’t find it; she’s more of a complementary piece than a heavy-handed force when writing for others, and that holds true for her work with Pierson. She excels at amplifying an artist’s best traits, whether that means highlighting their areas of musical skill or connecting with them to help craft a particularly resonant piece of lyric. That’s what she does with Pierson throughout the record: The two of them understand that her greatest strength is her voice, and they push it to the forefront of every song. Pierson hasn’t lost any of the force or heat that’s characterized her vocal work for 40 years; if anything, she’s acquired the ability to enrich otherwise pedestrian line readings with a resonance that feels born of a life well lived. When she guns for high, loud notes in climactic moments, like on the dreamy ""Crush Me With Your Love"", you can feel it burning in the pit of your stomach. That passion only intensifies when Pierson is singing about something that’s obviously important to her, be it her relationship with partner Monica Coleman (""Crush Me With Your Love"", ""Wolves"") or questions of independence and feminism (opener ""Throw Down the Roses""). The intensity is welcome, because it brightens up arrangements that split the difference between two very familiar brands of recent rock music: </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"" target=""_blank"">the Shins</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’ luminous, buoyant pop-rock, and the Strokes’ sharper, more tonally distinct work. The familiarity of the sounds is comforting, but fleeting. The only thing you remember after finishing a song is Pierson’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">There’s only one real misstep on </span><i>Guitars and Microphones</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, but it’s a big one, revolving around the concept and reception of lead single ""Mister Sister"". To hear Pierson tell it, it’s a chugging would-be anthem for anyone who’s ever felt that what’s inside of them isn’t being adequately reflected by what they see in the mirror, something that’s not specific to ideas about gender identity or sexuality or anything especially technical. But in giving a quote to </span><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jamie-cooper-holland/an-open-letter-to-kate-pierson_b_6279128.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Huffington Post</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, she used the phrase, ""I hope it becomes a trans anthem,” a well-meaning but bold statement that seemed especially tone deaf given the song’s campier and more stereotypical elements. (If you’re interested in a more detailed analysis of why a potential Pierson attempt at a ""trans anthem"" would be inappropriate, </span><a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/52567-the-b-52s-kate-pierson-releases-trans-anthem-ahead-of-her-solo-debut-and-its-full-of"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this Bustle article</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is worthwhile.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">It was an unfortunate situation stemming from a miscommunication, and a great example of the misunderstandings and hurt that can flare up between even members of two different wings of the broader LGBT community. Pierson was quick to apologize, and has appeared eager to learn in </span><a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/kate-pierson-b-52s-guitars-microphones-solo-album-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews conducted since</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">. But unintentional offence aside, ""Mister Sister"" still feels like a relic from a different time; it aims for that aforementioned compassionate, quirky B-52s queerness, but falls short and ends up cheap and cloying. <span>On a purely musical level, it lacks the melodic firepower and passion that colors the best of </span><i>Guitars and Microphones</i><span>, with blocky riffs and a Pierson performance that skews a little campy but fails to engage the listener. Most</span> importantly, it’s an outlier on a record that manages to feel impressive, contemporary and vital with most of its other songs.</span></p></div>"|20255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20255-guitars-and-microphones/|6.4|Jamieson Cox

It's an EP designed to mimic the font of an old A&amp;M Records promo while transmitting from some strange outpost in Norway. One uncanny track was ""Åsså Med Den Derre Fløyta (Video Bootleg Med Den Elektriske Fløyta)"" composed of white noise run through a ring modulator, a Korg synthesizer and a plonking mbira that provided the telltale kick of a house beat. But then came a wheezing, not-quite-tuned flute line, unmooring it and nudging house music as close as it has ever come to the woozy, ecstatic sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18454-don-cherry/"">Don Cherry</a>’s </span><i>Organic Music Society</i><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">.</span></p>
<p>But almost any DJ Sotofett release I encounter (they can be rather maddening to track down) produces that same sense of exhilaration and bewilderment, the more incongruent the better. Take ""Lagrimas Negras"", where he twines Fran Benitez’s Spanish plaint around an ominous deep house throb, a mood not unlike that whisper of ""<i>silencio""</i> from <i>Mulholland Drive</i> stretched out over nearly 12 minutes. Across numerous vinyl releases, he scans as a mischievous scamp, prone to have his tracks wander across acid, freestyle, nu-disco, stiff digital reggae, sweaty house, cheeky New Age, as un-peggable as untraceable. <i>Drippin’ for a Tripp</i>, his double 12” for UK’s <a href=""http://honestjons.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Honest Jon’s</a> label, is about as far as he’s ever gone above ground, with each side of the record showcasing a different style.</p>
<p>For having such a peculiar sensibility, Sotofett collaborates often with a broad range of musicians. There’s that flautist, sure, but he’s also engaged with fellow countryman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"" target=""_blank"">Prins Thomas</a>, NYC disco producer Tim ""Love"" Lee, and noisy techno producer Madteo, to name just a few. And <i>Drippin’</i> showcases a new set of colleagues. There’s tracks made with influential Parisian producer/label head Gilb'R, Finnish musician Jaakko Eino Kalevi and German producer Phillip Lauer (both heard most recently via singles on the <a href=""http://www.beatsinspace.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beats in Space</a> imprint). Kalevi contributes a slowly unspooling guitar line to the opening spiral of ""Ibiza Dub (with Thomas ""Paleo's Buddy"" Mende)"" and then the ""Main Bar Mix"" seems to be engineered specifically for José Padilla to play in Ibiza come sunset, a warm, shiny, undeniably Balearic track that if you listen closely to, you can hear crickets chirping underneath all that bass. Lauer joins the proceedings on the second side. In light of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/646-synth-sorcerer-eight-essentials-by-the-late-tangerine-dream-founder-edgar-froese/"">Edgar Froese</a>’s recent passing, ""Space Dub"" feels like an homage of sorts, a gentle, twinkling slice of kosmische, while the nine-minute ""Nimbus-Mix"" adds shortwave squiggles, charming high frequencies, and bathtub-warm bass that brings to mind early Fila Brazillia.</p>
<p>On the second disc, there’s another take on the original ""Pulehouse"", those dreamy swells of Korg still intact, but with the starchy Nordic digital reggae drum programming of the original replaced by a battery of hand drums, nudging it over into tribal house territory. The highlight of the set is Sotofett’s collaboration with Karolin Tampere and Maimouna Haugen on ""Nondo"". The sputtering keys at times make me think of A-Musik productions, but the vocals bring to mind African house music. But then the beat also bears a stutter and skip that could make you think you heard it at a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/quebajoparty"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Que Bajo party</a> or else on some cosmic soca compilation.

Along with sister and guitarist Oni, the duo created frantic numbers packed with feedback and screaming, guided by a playful curiosity in what sounds their instruments and bodies could cough up. Pikachu hammered away at her kit while hollering into a microphone, and even their most slow-burning moments rarely allowed her space to rest. By the time Afrirampo disbanded in 2010, they had carved out a space next to fellow Japanese noise rockers (and friends) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Boredoms</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12-acid-mothers-temple/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Acid Mothers Temple</a>, while attracting attention from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt </a>among others.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It might be surprising for those who didn’t follow Pikachu’s career after Afrirampo to hear <i>Ryu No Sumika</i>, her latest solo album recorded under the moniker Pika. She’s always been part of various side projects even while Afrirampo barreled forward, most notably as Moon Mama, which sometimes featured cello player Hiromichi Sakamoto taking an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5yrI0WquUE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">electric drill to his instrument</a>. Like many Japanese musicians, however, she changed her focus after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear incident. She helped start <a href=""http://taiyo33osaka.net/honsai/en.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taiyo 33 Osaka</a>, a project focusing on exploring future of energy sources and just making people feel happy after the disaster. And she started playing the songs that would end up forming <i>Sumika</i>, songs that moved away from chaos in favor of reflective numbers that are happy to take their time getting anywhere.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The title track opens the album, and it offers a fake out aimed at anyone expecting a reversion to Afrirampo form. After nearly four minutes of build, Pikachu lets the song burst open in a rush of chirps, drum smacks and guitar squall. But this brief stretch ends up being the only real throwback to her dissonant heyday, as the bulk of <i>Ryu No Sumika</i> finds Pikachu operating against sparser backdrops. ""Reazon"" strolls forward via acoustic guitar and piano, while ""Kara Wo Mitara"" is pure campfire sing-a-long, accented by clarinet courtesy of David Duval-Smith.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Afrirampo, however, wasn’t just great because they could make clattering shriekfests better than most. They were an extremely <i>fun</i> band, unafraid to go off in whatever goofy direction appealed to them, including <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Yw58q0duo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pretending to be various Australian mammals </a>in concert. The sonic backdrop might be different, but Pikachu is still unafraid to follow whatever muse beckons her forward. Highlight ""Mermaid"" might be the closest Japan’s noise community comes to making a Broadway number, as Pikachu verbally skips among steel drums, at one point ditching words entirely in favor of tongue trills (adding to the theater vibe, several guests are credited as ""performers,"" their roles listed as ""Merman"" or ""Merman’s friend""). Elsewhere, she spends seven minutes listing off different types of people, sometimes with vague political implications (""American"" and ""Iraqi"" falling next to each other for example) and somehow making this potentially eye-rolling sentiment work thanks to her enthusiasm for the idea...along with drama-raising violin from Katsui Yuji.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Yuji is a good example of what else makes <i>Ryu No Sumika</i> work. Pikachu’s selection in contributors comprises an all-star cast of artists hailing from Japan’s improvised and experimental music communities, and many of their contributions add welcome tension. Sakamoto appears across <i>Sumika</i>, and though he never grinds power tools against his cello, he does add prickles of unease to otherwise direct songs such as ""Onnanoko Yurayura"". Acid Mothers Temple mastermind Kawabata Makoto joins Pikachu, wonky singer-songwriter Tavito Nanao and sine-wave aficionado Sachiko M on ""Sen"", <i>Sumika’s</i> bleakest cut. Saeki Mayumi—better known as Afrirampo’s Oni—even stops by to read poetry on an interlude track.</p>
<p>That moment feels important, a signal that the freewheeling spirit behind Afrirampo also inhabits <i>Ryu No Sumika</i>, just in a different shape. Sometimes Pikachu’s more patient approach falters, with several songs meandering and going on too long, but it also results in some deeply sweet and earnest moments. ""Okaasan"" opens with the line ""Mother/ Yesterday mother died,"" and from there Pikachu turns in her most passionate vocals on the album as the music swells around her, reaching the point where her singing approaches breakdown. It’s the peak emotional moment on an album where Pikachu matures musically without losing the youthful playfulness that led her to this point.</p></div>"|20230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20230-ryu-no-sumika/|7.0|Patrick St. Michel

After eight years of extreme cultural, political and artistic upheaval, it's likely that you're in a much different place than you were when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10717-in-our-nature/""><i>In Our Nature</i></a> was released. Meanwhile, the music of José González has not changed at all. Are you in or are you out?</p>
<p>Whether it’s his greatest asset or biggest sticking point, González endures while the context around him changes. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3682-veneer/""><i>Veneer</i></a> had the benefit of timing, as <i>Garden State</i> and ""The O.C."" were redefining ""alt-rock"" as ""indie."" González evoked the spare beauty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a>’s <i>Pink Moon</i> but not the crippling emotional baggage, and he had a good ear for crowd-pleasing covers, easing fans into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2782-kylie-minogue/"">Kylie Minogue</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a> (prior to their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/""><i>Silent Shout</i></a> about-face) when walls between genres seemed more solid. By 2007's <i>In Our Nature</i>, his name was mentioned alongside whispery and haunted projects like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26448-iron-wine/"">Iron &amp; Wine</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"">Sun Kil Moon</a>; González is the only one that can still be described as whispery and haunted in 2015.</p>
<p>González self-produces on <i>Vestiges &amp; Claws</i> and there’s an unvarnished, prickly edge to the recording. Even when others are in the room, the album feels solitary—the cello and flute on ""The Forest"" might as well be weaving in and out of González’s head. His best songs don’t <i>unfold</i>, exactly; instead, the cyclical guitar and vocal patterns sound like they’re adding invisible but perceptible layers. Though his vocals are as soft and supple as a down comforter, there’s an eerie quality to González’s restraint and levity. He reaches for high notes and hooks, but he never raises his voice—he’s post-anger, post-verse-and-chorus. His fingerpicking lends a percussive, rhythmic drive that can obscure the actual drums. The percussion on ""Leaf Off / The Cave"" is almost imperceptible under off-kilter, low-register riffs that sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/91-and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead"" target=""_blank"">Trail of Dead </a>arranged for a campfire singalong.</p>
<p>Though González’s music is pastoral in timbre and placid in pace, his songs ask big questions. How do you situate yourself in the world? What makes a person take dominion over another? How much time should a laborer set aside for leisure? How can you make your voice heard without crowding out those who feel less inclined to speak? His approach to songwriting has appeal in light of the stridency and self-righteousness of modern discourse. But González’s metaphors can also feel unnecessarily feathery or too general: ""Every Age"" buckles under the assumed weight of its introductory lyric (""Every age has its turn/ Every branch of the tree has to learn/ Learn to grow, find its way""), and while ""Leaf Off / The Cave"" boasts the record’s loveliest arrangement, the connection between the Garden of Eden and Plato’s Cave is specious and tenuous in a charming, AP English sort of way.</p>
<p>Even when <i>Vestiges &amp; Claws</i> exudes strain, González never gives the impression of truly challenging himself. When he draws on the canons of both ancient philosophy and post-punk, he sounds like José González. Whether covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Bruce Springsteen</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>, he sounds like José González. Even when fronting a legitimate, kraut-influenced rock band in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28804-junip/"">Junip</a>, it just sounds like José González with the rhythmic tracework of his solo albums filled in. But as a record that so frequently meditates on unchanging human nature, that could just mean <i>Vestiges &amp; Claws</i> achieved exactly what it set out to do.</p></div>"|20251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20251-vestiges-claws/|6.6|Ian Cohen

""If I could just be ate/ At least someone might say I was worthy,"" he sings, resigned to a life as an undigested peanut.</p>
<p>So yeah, Krill are a little juvenile and a lot insecure—the title of that EP, <a href=""http://wheretheresakrilltheresaway.bandcamp.com/album/steve-hears-pile-in-malden-and-bursts-into-tears"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Steve Hears Pile in Malden and Bursts into Tears</i></a>, refers to Krill’s admiration for (and low-key jealousy of) fellow Bostonians and <a href=""http://www.explodinginsoundrecords.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Exploding in Sound</a> label-mates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23650-pile/"" target=""_blank"">Pile</a>. On <a href=""http://wheretheresakrilltheresaway.bandcamp.com/album/lucky-leaves"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Lucky Leaves</i></a>, Krill’s borderline-paranoid 2013 album, Furman defended the right to feel like a failure. But in the year that followed the release of <i>Steve</i>, something changed. ""I was thinking about how <i>Lucky Leaves</i> had all of this sad shit, and I believed in it and totally agree with it, but I wanted to see where you could go after that,"" Furman <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/premieres/hear-rising-rock-weirdos-krills-bizarre-new-song-tiger-20150130"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Rolling Stone</a> last month. The result is the band’s best album to date, the bigger, brighter and bolder <i>A Distant Fist Unclenching</i>, which locates a weird confidence in the universality of our individual anxieties.</p>
<p>Pile-worship aside, <i>Fist</i> finds more evident kinship with another band just a few hundred miles north: Montreal's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32221-ought/"" target=""_blank"">Ought</a>, whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19248-ought-more-than-any-other-day/"" target=""_blank""><i>More Than Any Other Day</i></a> was one of last year’s finest indie rock releases. Both Furman and Ought’s Tim Beeler deal in open-ended questions and nervous tics, suggesting worried young men striving for uncommon lives. Though <i>Fist </i>has more passion than anything Krill have done, Furman is still a dyspeptic figure, asking God to grant him strength to deal with his ""brain problem.""</p>
<p>But for all of Furman’s neuroses, there’s a purgative quality to <i>Fist</i> that feels almost joyful. It helps that the band has become powerful enough to lift Furman out of his own head for a little while, boosted also by cleaner production and more distinctive guitar work. Their secret weapon remains drummer Ian Becker, whose dynamics and off-kilter rhythms keep everyone on their toes. Once content with mere tantrums, Krill are now flirting with an almost anthemic sound, with songs like ""Squirrels"" and ""Brain Problem"" climaxing in ways big enough to inspire listeners to keep their fists not only clenched, but aloft.</p>
<p><i>Fist</i> will present a few sticking points for some listeners, the most notable being Furman’s voice. Like an unfortunate cross between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/633-eef-barzelay/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Eef Barzelay</a> and <a href=""http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Jeremy_Freedman"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Freedman</a> (plus a little Bobcat Goldthwait for when he gets really riled up), it scans anywhere from vaguely comical in its jittery frogginess to weirdly precious. And while he's deft with odds turn of phrase, Furman is often too reliant on metaphors either too simple (""It Ends"") or too open-ended to connect. But when they get it right, like on the stuttering S&amp;M allegory <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17247-krill-torturer/"" target=""_blank"">""Torturer""</a>, everything clicks into place.</p>
<p>Above all else, <i>A Distant Fist Unclenching</i> is an album about embracing clarity in the face of constant, nagging doubt <span>(""To be given one shot, and to know I could blow it,"" Furman wails on ""Squirrels"").</span> On seven-minute centerpiece ""Tiger"", the titular unclenched fist appears ""in the distance,"" but ""in the nearness,"" Furman sings, ""there is a bad day ending."" Though Krill aren’t quite ready to let go of the anxieties that inspired them to write their eccentricities in excrement in the first place, <i>Fist</i> suggests that there is light at the end of the sewer drain.</p></div>"|20161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20161-a-distant-fist-unclenching/|6.9|Zach Kelly

In some senses, that was par for the course of the bare, monochromatic drum and bass exercises that have populated many of his releases. Over the past couple of years, the man has morphed into a kitchen-sink sort of tinkerer, with one hand still dedicated to the rapid-fire clicks and thumps of the now-aging sphere he came up in. But he's casually embraced a whole host of genres with similarly downcast dispositions: brittle blasts of noise, desolate stretches of ambient composition, the thunderous foreboding bass work of dub. On </span><i>Tragedy of the Commons</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, Krone engages single-mindedly with those gloomy impulses and crafts a uniquely bleak release fitting of its home on the London-based purveyors of all things Cimmerian <a href=""http://blackesteverblack.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blackest Ever Black</a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Much of this EP's runtime is taken up by the title track, an expansive ambient piece that manages to be his most striking meditation on melancholia yet. Devoid of the jittery percussion that's marked most of his work, he's free to indulge in more abstract composition. Bleary smears of off-kilter arpeggios and thunderous bass blasts that give a sense of immediacy to the track's delirious plod and found sound samples of ghostly chatters and creaks lend a bodily terror to the piece. Beyond the purely cinematic horror of many darker ambient works, Krone adds details that give ""Tragedy of the Commons"" a sense of a real physical space, a grimy sort of environment that becomes more unsettling the more you explore it.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At its 17-and-a-half-minute length, the murk and mire of ""Tragedy of the Commons"" could have easily collapsed in on itself, but as static-y samples and slurred synth lines continually edge their way into the mix, it manages to earn its monumental length. Despite the fact that Krone is used to using drums to give shape and form to his tracks, he's still able here to give an amorphous piece some narrative weight. He demonstrates a knack for casually adding more and more moving parts to the mix, spinning details off one another to reshape the structure into fresh, unfamiliar forms across the track's whole runtime. It's an approach he picks back up on the B-side too. And though the drums return for the shorter piece ""Silent Money"", he's still scrambling tenebrous synthesizer parts and spoken-word samples as the track proceeds, making even the more familiar structures of that work hard to fully apprehend. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Marginally less essential is the collection's closer, a thunderous rave-up called ""Fundamentals"" that's credited as a remix by the unknown quantity Onar Anxiety. Billowing noise is pinned down instead here by a pummeling drum loop that doesn't relent for more than a few moments of the track's six minutes, and it settles into a more static sort of horror that underscores <i>Tragedy of the Commons</i>' dynamic high points. Felix K is still working with the same black-and-white palette that's colored his whole career. But in stretching out and working in a more explicitly formless mode, he's granted more freedom to play with a more fully developed vision of instrumental darkness than ever before.</span></p></div>"|20229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20229-tragedy-of-the-commons-ep/|7.4|Colin Joyce

The difference between a cash grab and a victory lap feels ever more slight. Of course, it’s not always that way. There’s even something to be said for artists approaching their back catalog with a sort of humorous disdain. In the late 1980s, art-punks </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> reformed, only to announce they wouldn’t play any of their older material, instead hiring a cover band, the Ex-Lion Tamers, to perform that function in the opening slot of their shows.</span></p>
<p>The approach Wire took for those concerts—essentially not giving fans what they want, even actively antagonizing them—is a feeling with which Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti, founding members of industrial behemoths <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>, are acutely familiar. These are people, after all, who were once <a href=""http://www.blackdogonline.com/music/wreckers-of-civilisation.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deemed</a> the ""wreckers of civilisation."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32738-carter-tutti/"">Carter Tutti</a> have been addressing their past, in various tours and reissue programs, for more than 10 years at this point. Their path through it is often inspired, with the dissolution of the reunited Throbbing Gristle leading to the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17376-desertshore/"">X-TG</a> album. In tandem, their brittle electronic music as Chris &amp; Cosey began to cast a long influence over body music-inspired artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"">Factory Floor</a>, culminating in a fully energized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16431-transverse/"">collaboration</a> with that band’s Nik Colk Void.</p>
<p>Since 2011, the pair have been sporadically playing dates where they take a fresh approach to the Chris &amp; Cosey material, stripping it of the production trappings of the various eras they draw on, instead replacing it with something tougher and far more impactful. This is the recorded document to accompany those shows, put together in Carter Tutti’s studio in the English countryside. It’s a sound that meshes elements of their past lives—the fussy electronics speak of Carter’s career as a synth boffin and TV sound engineer, while the pulsing backing and breathy vocals hark to Tutti’s work as a stripper. Tutti even recalled as much in a recent <a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/373"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> interview. ""I was bringing back things like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1185-donna-summer/"">Donna Summer</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a> from my stripping,"" she said, of Throbbing Gristle’s attempted turn to that sound.</p>
<p><i>Carter Tutti Plays Chris &amp; Cosey</i> illustrates the extent to which Carter Tutti are still enamored with dousing raw electronics in a seedy, heavily sexualized tone. Much of the album moves at a trance-like pace, strung somewhere between something you can either dance to or zone out on. The opening ""Lost Bliss"" (from <i>Megatropolis</i>) and ""Driving Blind"" (from <i>Songs of Love &amp; Lust</i>) are highlights, bringing in a pop edge and much fuller production than the originals—a signature strung throughout most of these reworkings. It’s possible to hear legions of electronic acts from the past decade or so in here, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"">Zola Jesus</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2408-ladytron/"">Ladytron</a>, even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1498-fischerspooner/"">Fischerspooner</a>, making it easy to conclude that Tutti’s vocal style—masterfully disengaged no matter what the subject matter—might be one of the great unheralded influences of the 2000s.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see why the Carter Tutti/Factory Floor relationship flourished so fruitfully when working through this material. Both work from a starting point that’s largely unmoveable—rippling Moroder electronics, a pinch of dance culture that’s more observatory than participatory—and drive their point into the ground over the course of an album. The shift from ""Beatbeatbeat"" (from <i>Exotica</i>) to ""Workout"" (a 1987 single) highlights how they build with remarkably similar tools then subtly corrupt the formula from within. ""Workout"" is wonderfully obliterated by Tutti’s railroad guitar lines, which butt up against chunky synth patterns that divert close to the whiteout assault of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1304-808-state/"">808 State</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIA2ddd8Bo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""In Yer Face""</a> (a track actually released a few years after ""Workout"").</p>
<p>Overhauling prior work may not be the most unique tool in the backward facing bandwagon of old lags giving the circuit one last run-around. But the difference with <i>Plays Chris &amp; Cosey</i> is of a duo pushing beyond what came before instead of resting too heavily on things that already exist, in much the same way as it was in the general atmosphere of the X-TG album. They make revisiting the past sound like a creative place to be, where latent potential is given some room to breathe in the noxious, leather-fueled atmosphere of these songs. An important aspect, perhaps, is that Carter Tutti have myriad contemporary projects they’re working on at the same time as addressing material like this. As such, this record reads like an object lesson in how former glories are sometime best served by becoming a malleable part of the present.</p></div>"|20231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20231-carter-tutti-plays-chris-cosey/|7.0|Nick Neyland

Things did not get any easier for them in the interim. After skipping out on <i>Infinity Caller</i>’s tours due to day-job commitments, bassist Emily Ambruso—whose history with band co-founder Travis Johnson dates back to their pre-Grooms outfit, the Muggabears—decided she could no longer afford to be in the band. That said, no amount of financial security could’ve inured Grooms to the subsequent blow of losing their longtime studio space, Death by Audio, last fall to <a href=""http://gawker.com/no-one-wants-to-say-it-but-vice-is-displacing-brooklyn-1649005022"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the office complex that ate Williamsburg</a>. All this would seemingly make Grooms the ideal sad-sack subjects for some ""60 Minutes"" segment on the depressing economic reality of the aspiring modern American indie-rock band. But don’t feel too sorry for Grooms—on their fourth and most illuminating album to date, the band don’t sound defeated so much as defiantly liberated.</p>
<p>The trajectory of Travis Johnson’s creative evolution mirrors that of indie rock itself. Where the Muggabears conjured a distinctly early-'90s discord, and the first few Grooms albums hewed toward the more refined melodicism of post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> college rock, with <i>Comb the Feelings Through Your Hair</i>, Johnson and company have reached the same career crossroads that forbears like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">the Flaming Lips</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> hit at the turn of the millennium. And while they haven’t gone so far as to embrace the orchestral pomp of the former or the abstract electronic experimentation of the latter, <i>Comb the Feelings Through Your Hair</i>—the last album to be recorded at Death by Audio prior to its closure last November—bears the telltale signs of an indie rock band who’ve become bored with being just another indie rock band: Guitars take a back seat to synth-powered rhythmic propulsion; traditional song forms get broken down into open-ended arrangements; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a> records get dusted off for spiritual guidance.</p>
<p>But while Johnson’s standing as the last remaining original Grooms member would presumably make him the band’s de facto musical leader, <i>Comb the Feelings</i> fully harnesses the collaborative potential of the lineup he assembled for <i>Infinity Caller</i>’s tours. Throughout the record, bassist Jay Heiselmann and drummer-cum-""Better Call Saul"" star Steve Levine (this album’s MVP) establish a restless rhythmic undertow that stews beneath the songs’ deceptively placid surfaces. At its most potent—like on the title track, or the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/"">Lonerism</a></i>-scaled ""Will the Boys""—the tension between Johnson’s clear-headed, plainspoken delivery and the band’s equilibrium-upsetting textural overload conjures that sensation of trying to keep your cool in mixed company while feeling like a heart-palpating, panic-attacked mess on the inside.</p>
<p>In terms of sound and vision, <i>Comb the Feelings</i> constitutes a massive upgrade from Grooms’ hazy, hermetically sealed previous releases, trading in underdog scrappiness for boldness and bravado. It’s the sort of album where every song ends up in a much different place than where it started and, in the case of the roiling opener ""Bed Version"", sometimes the big instrumental hook isn’t revealed until the outro. But Grooms are still getting a feel for the new sonic environments they’ve opened for themselves, and still figuring out how their linear melodies fit into more amorphous surroundings, resulting in some abrupt structural shifts that leave the seams showing. Perhaps sensing that the krautrockin’ rave-up ""Doctor M"" is precisely the sort of predictable move indie rock bands resort to when they’re trying to be unpredictable, Grooms derail its motorik momentum into an extended ambient symphony that, for added enigmatic effect, dissolves into indecipherable party chatter. The following ""Half Cloud"", meanwhile, begins as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painters</a>-style reverie before a martial drumbeat clears the way for a feedback-sculpted passage that cuts out just as the song seems to be venturing into uncharted territory, like a hastily scrapped rough sketch for some unrealized master plan. But that sort of impulsiveness is the natural byproduct of an album from a long-suffering band audibly brimming with a renewed sense of purpose. If not all its experiments yield consistently entrancing results, <i>Comb the Feelings</i> is the sound of Grooms basking in the first radiant glimpse of a future that, not too long ago, it didn’t think it’d live long enough to see.</p></div>"|20263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20263-comb-the-feelings-through-your-hair/|7.3|Stuart Berman

Cash Money Records has escaped the fate of the Roc-A-Fellas and Bad Boys thanks to the enduring genius of Bryan ""Baby"" Williams, AKA <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12128-birdman/"">Birdman</a>. Birdman’s business acumen and A&amp;R smarts carried Cash Money through three distinct eras, from the late '90s Hot Boys heyday through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a>’s mid- to late-2000s bid for ""Best Rapper Alive"" to the current YMCMB incarnation featuring Drake and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>. (With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a> he seems to be training still another army.) The wheels appeared to come off of the Cash Money machine for good, however, on a random December afternoon when Wayne gave a <a href=""https://twitter.com/LilTunechi/status/540569858287493120"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">curt Twitter update</a> on his long-gestating <i>Tha Carter V</i> album, blaming Birdman and Cash Money for the holdup and demanding an exit from the label he’s called home most of his life. He’s since initiated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58255-lil-wayne-sues-birdman-and-cash-money-for-51-million-freedom-from-label/"">an audacious $51 million lawsuit</a> requesting not only his own exit but that of Drake and Nicki Minaj as well.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Drake and Nicki have been smartly mum on the split (well, <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2015/02/08/birdman-denied-grammy-party-nicki-minaj-lil-wayne-cash-money/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">word around town</a> is Birdman was barred from Minaj’s Grammy party earlier this month), but years of whispers about Drake being owed <a href=""http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2012/07/drake%E2%80%99s-management-sued-for-unpaid-royalties/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">substantial back royalties</a> were publicly validated with the surprise release of <i>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late</i>, a retail mixtape arriving on the six year anniversary of Drake’s star-making <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13238-so-far-gone/""><i>So Far Gone</i></a>. <i>If You’re Reading This </i>is littered with pith for Drake’s label situation (""No Tellin’"": ""Envelopes coming in the mail, let her open ‘em/ Hoping for a check again, ain’t no telling,"" ""Star67"": ""Brand new Beretta, can’t wait to let it go/ Walk up in my label like ‘Where the check, though?’""), and all of this surfacing weeks after Wayne’s lawsuit bombshell raises a few questions. Is this release a<a href=""http://allhiphop.com/2015/02/13/did-drake-just-get-out-of-cash-money-with-if-youre-reading-this/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> ruse to close out Drake’s Cash Money deal</a>? Is the absence of Birdman from the mixtape’s lengthy thank you's an oversight or an intentional slight? Is the title a dig?</p>
<p class=""normal""><i>If You’re Reading This </i>arouses many unanswered questions on a business front, but where it truly delivers is giving Drake room to breathe outside of the lumbering commercialism of his retail albums. There’s little in the way of obvious singles here, (though the Ibiza bop ""Preach"" might find a chart by accident). Instead we get a spectral late-night longing not unlike that of <i>So Far Gone </i>touchstones ""Lust for Life"" and ""Successful"". The pre-fame queasiness of early Drake is now the loneliness of a distrustful despot. On ""10 Bands"" he’s holed up in a home studio for weeks pushing himself to create (""Drapes closed, I don’t know what time it is/ I’m still awake, I gotta shine this year""). ""Know Yourself"" celebrates the thrill of mobbing through a city that’s his for the taking, but even in joy there’s a note of tension and the ever-present possibility of actual danger. (""I ain’t rock my jewelry, and that’s on purpose/ Niggas want my spot and don’t deserve it."") Success creates as many problems as it solves.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Music is the real joy for Drake, and <i>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late </i>is best enjoyed as an exercise in the casual excellence of the artist as rhymer and purveyor of hooks. The vocals are often just vampy flow experiments, but at their best these verses exhibit the weightless exhilaration of a technician at work. Drake’s never more formidable than when he’s shadowboxing, and at its flashiest, <i>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late </i>feels like his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NubH5BDOaD8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rocky</i></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NubH5BDOaD8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> run</a>. Inspired by gauntlet tosses from adversaries high and low, Drake uses the mixtape to toast and taunt a rogue’s gallery of industry frenemies. For <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7422-diddy/"">Diddy</a>, who reportedly punched him over ownership of the beat for ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"": ""Real quick, man, you couldn’t’ve hated that/ Let’s be real, nigga, you couldn’t’ve made it that."" For disgruntled labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29472-tyga/"">Tyga</a>, who insulted Drake in a <a href=""http://www.vibe.com/article/digital-cover-tyga-king-unchained-page-3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Vibe </i></a><a href=""http://www.vibe.com/article/digital-cover-tyga-king-unchained-page-3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">magazine feature</a>: ""You need to act your age and not your girl’s age."" For friend-turned-rival <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>: ""They gon’ say your name on them airwaves/ They gon hit you after like it’s only rap.""</p>
<p class=""normal"">On <i>If You’re Reading This</i>, all of this chest beating is delivered over the most darkly hypnotic beats Drake’s graced since <i>So Far Gone</i>. Much of the mixtape foregoes the supervision of his producer-in-residence Noah ""40"" Shebib, but 40’s codeine-soul aesthetic is the ghost in the machine. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31498-partynextdoor/"">PARTYNEXTDOOR</a> showcase ""Wednesday Night Interlude"" matches the OVO signee’s pleading vocal to a chunk of Canadian producer Ekali’s ethereal <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8a6fiwVJs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Unfaith""</a>, itself an interpolation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"">Ciara</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15056-ciara-body-party/"">""Body Party""</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29157-ginuwine/"">Ginuwine</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a>’s 2000 classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT-75YEclqg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""So Anxious""</a> is sampled twice, soundtracking the slow-cooking opener ""Legend"" and the 40 contribution ""Madonna"". Where R&amp;B sounds aren’t incorporated directly, their thick sensuality is frequently hinted at. The pace of the mixtape rarely elevates past a crawl, reveling in the moody, winding instrumentals and hooky sentimentality of Boi-1da, PARTYNEXTDOOR and newcomers Wondagurl, SykSense, and Sevn Thomas without worrying about posting upbeat knockers to Top 40 radio.</p>
<p class=""normal"">In the days to come you’ll read that Drake ""pulled a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>"" with the stealth drop of <i>If You’re Reading This</i>, and yes, both are surprise releases from A-list artists topping the charts without a rollout or much in the way of an advance warning. But <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead"">Radiohead</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10785-in-rainbows/""><i>In Rainbows </i></a>is the better comparison: Both records found the artists revisiting the mood of a highly regarded early work as they transition into new methods of delivering music to fans. Whether the Drake tape is a clever track dump disguised as an album with the intent of worming out of his Cash Money deal, a deliberately planned gesture to tide fans over until the upcoming <i>Views from the 6</i>, or just an exercise in shirking the protracted waits and missed dates of the retail rap game, <i>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late </i>winningly employs the occasion of the <i>So Far Gone </i>anniversary to revisit the twilight consternation of Drake’s breakout release, perhaps to close out a chapter of his career on the same note on which it began.</p></div>"|20271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20271-if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late/|8.3|Craig Jenkins

On March 7, more than 600 marchers set out to make the 50-mile walk from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and were attacked by Alabama state troopers and armed posses. Two days later, they tried again, but turned back when Governor George Wallace denied them state protection. Two long weeks later, they tried a third time, with federal protection from the US Army and the National Guard. It took them three days, but they finally reached the state capitol.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks later and several hundred miles north, one of the hottest groups on the gospel circuit debuted a new song during a service at the New Nazareth Church on Chicago’s South Side. Pops Staples, patriarch and bandleader of the formidable Staple Singers, explained the inspiration in his introduction. ""From that march, word was revealed and a song was composed,"" he explains, sounding less like a preacher addressing his congregation and more like a close friend shaking your hand. ""And we wrote a song about the freedom marchers and we call it the ‘Freedom Highway’, and we dedicate this number to all the freedom marchers."" As he is addressing the congregation, Pops strikes a clutch of chords on his guitar, and those chords coalesce into a spry blues riff that he sends rolling down the aisles of New Nazareth.</p>
<p>Then Al Duncan enters on drums, his rhythm a little funkier and more physical than you might expect in such a godly setting; Phil Upchurch lays down an elastic bass line, and the syncopated clatter of handclaps completes the rhythm section. Just as the song is taking off, the Staple Singers—Pops and his kids Pervis, Yvonne, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13971-mavis-staples/"">Mavis</a>—shout the chorus: ""Marching… up freedom highway, marching… each and every day."" Mavis sings lead on the verses, her voice lunging at the low notes and filling every space in the sanctuary. Despite the worry in the lyrics (""The whole wide world is wonderin’ what’s wrong with the United States""), the family does not sound concerned or beaten down or fatigued in any way. Rather, ""Freedom Highway"" is pure jubilation, as though the Staples are celebrating that third march to Montgomery, confident in the righteousness of their cause. With God on their side, how could they fail?</p>
<p>Recording the performance that day was producer Billy Sherrill, who edited the songs for radio play, then rearranged them for the Staples’ first live album, <i>Freedom Highway</i>. Instead of coming halfway through the performance, the title track opened the first side, announcing Pops’ intentions of connecting gospel music with the struggle for civil rights. It was the family’s biggest hit to date, a pivotal record that inched them toward the pop mainstream without sacrificing their gospel message for a secular audience. In that regard, the New Nazareth concert proves a pivotal event not just for the family, but for pop music in general—just as crucial as anything that happened at Woodstock or Monterey, albeit not as storied or as celebrated. Somehow, the record slipped out of print and has been unavailable for decades. (An excellent 1991 <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Staple-Singers-Freedom-Highway/release/1363905"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">compilation</a> bears the same title but includes only two tracks from the album among contemporaneous studio and live recordings.)</p>
<p>To mark the 50th anniversary of the freedom marches as well as the Staples’ performance, the New Nazareth concert has been remastered and restored to its original setlist and runtime, complete with a short sermon by Rev. Dr. John E. Hopkins, a benediction, and even a guilt-motivated offertory (""We got less than 75 dollars here. You know this is not right."") As a historical artifact, it is invaluable for what it reveals about gospel performances of the era, even if the proceedings fall into a lull whenever the singing gives way to talking. That’s true of so many church services, though, especially those you don’t actually get to attend.</p>
<p>This remaster, however, emphasizes the bustle of the congregation, lending the proceedings a you-are-there intimacy. You can hear every cough and mutter, every rifle of a Bible page, and every amen. In this vivid setting, the songs take on new power. Pervis’s recitation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"">Hank Williams</a>’ ""The Funeral"" sounds more intensely melancholy, as though he is not quite convinced of God’s mysterious motivations but is surrendering to Him nonetheless. You can hear Pops joking with his son-in-law just before he launches into ""Samson and Delilah"", and his good spirits inject the song with a vivid snap.</p>
<p>And this version restores the original sequencing, so that ""Freedom Highway"" is immediately preceded by ""We Shall Overcome"", which was a familiar standard that had taken on new relevance for African Americans during the 1960s. It’s a sly bit of programming by Pops, as it primes the audience to respond enthusiastically to a tune they do not know. Yet, ""Freedom Highway"" is a very different song, one that is less concerned with someday and more interested in today. It was Pops’ way of marking a victory, of saying they were already in the process of overcoming.</p>
<p>Even if he was often overshadowed by his daughter Mavis, whose voice often sounded like the hand of God parting the clouds, Pops was definitely the leader of the group and the head of the family. Even as they won mainstream success, trading choir robes for Afros and churches for concert halls, he kept them rooted in gospel and focused on a spiritual message. He also became an influence on several generations of guitarists—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16022-robbie-robertson/"">Robbie Robertson</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"">the Band</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5958-john-fogerty/"">John Fogerty</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8318-creedence-clearwater-revival/"">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>—who mimicked Pops’s nimble melodic lines and distinctive tremolo. Shortly before he died in 2000, he recorded a handful of new and old songs, just him and his guitar, and he must have been pleased with the results, because he entrusted the tapes with his daughters with the request, ""Don’t lose this.""</p>
<p>Mavis held on to them for 15 years, before asking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4314-jeff-tweedy/"">Jeff Tweedy</a> to complete them. To his credit the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> frontman brings to these songs the same restraint he showed on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14666-you-are-not-alone/"">You Are Not Alone</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18220-mavis-staples-one-true-vine/"">One True Vine</a></i>. He never crowds the performances with extraneous elements or modern touches; in fact, he is largely invisible on <i>Don’t Lose This</i>, occasionally playing bass and generally trusting Pops and his guitar to speak as clearly now as they did in 1998 or in 1965. <a href=""http://spencertweedy.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spencer Tweedy</a> plays drums on a few songs and proves himself to be as sensitive a sideman here as he did on last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19682-tweedy-sukierae/"">Sukierae</a></i>. His beats on ""No News Is Good News"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17285-pops-staples-somebody-was-watching/"">""Somebody Was Watching""</a> have a textural quality that accentuates the songs’ genial funk, and he knows exactly where to put the downbeat so that it complements Pops’ vocals. Spencer may be one of the best and most interesting drummers around, but he also knows this is someone else’s show.</p>
<p>As a result, <i>Don’t Lose This</i> sounds like an excellent entry point for newcomers and casual fans, a gateway to exploring the Staples’ vast catalog. Without sounding like a career retrospective, the album revisits the straightforward gospel of the '50s and '60s as well as the sunshine funk of the '70s, all the while playing up the humane optimism in Pops’ vocals. Songs like ""Sweet Home"" and ""Love on My Side"" may depict men at their lowest points—steeped in self-pity, pickled with booze, distant from God—but they are cautionary tales: Any of us could end up in a similar situation, lonely and despairing but never undeserving of redemption.</p>
<p>Still, this is a Pops album in name only. At its core, it may be the final Staple Singers record. His children—including Cleotha, who died in 2013—feature prominently on many of these songs, harmonizing as sweetly as ever in the background and occasionally even taking lead. It’s bracing to hear them sing together again, especially on a song like ""Sweet Home"", which plays up their individual styles. Pops’ vocals are steady and measured, exuding the quiet authority of a man confident that he’ll see heaven. But Mavis’ voice flutters around his in a perfectly controlled gospel melisma that mimics the motion and expressive tone of a reed instrument. For a lesser singer, her performance might sound ostentatious or overbearing, but for Mavis, it sounds natural and fluid, a perfect complement to her father’s performance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the standout on <i>Don’t Lose This</i> is ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"", an old Baptist hymn popularized in the 1930s by another pop music patriarch, A.P. Carter. The Staples covered the song in the '60s, but 40 years will change anyone’s perspective on life and death. Chronicling the funeral of a beloved parent, the song poses the important question, Will the bonds of family persist beyond this world? On the new version Pops manages to gently interpret the song, singing not from the point of view of a child losing a parent, but from the perspective of a parent singing to the children he will leave behind. Even if it’s not the last song on the album, it sounds like a final statement, one last bit of wisdom from a man who showed us the spiritual potential in pop music of all kinds.</p></div>"|20155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20155-freedom-highway-completedont-lose-this/|8.7|Stephen M.

<p>Recording the performance that day was producer Billy Sherrill, who edited the songs for radio play, then rearranged them for the Staples’ first live album, <i>Freedom Highway</i>. Instead of coming halfway through the performance, the title track opened the first side, announcing Pops’ intentions of connecting gospel music with the struggle for civil rights. It was the family’s biggest hit to date, a pivotal record that inched them toward the pop mainstream without sacrificing their gospel message for a secular audience. In that regard, the New Nazareth concert proves a pivotal event not just for the family, but for pop music in general—just as crucial as anything that happened at Woodstock or Monterey, albeit not as storied or as celebrated. Somehow, the record slipped out of print and has been unavailable for decades. (An excellent 1991 <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Staple-Singers-Freedom-Highway/release/1363905"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">compilation</a> bears the same title but includes only two tracks from the album among contemporaneous studio and live recordings.)</p>
<p>To mark the 50th anniversary of the freedom marches as well as the Staples’ performance, the New Nazareth concert has been remastered and restored to its original setlist and runtime, complete with a short sermon by Rev. Dr. John E. Hopkins, a benediction, and even a guilt-motivated offertory (""We got less than 75 dollars here. You know this is not right."") As a historical artifact, it is invaluable for what it reveals about gospel performances of the era, even if the proceedings fall into a lull whenever the singing gives way to talking. That’s true of so many church services, though, especially those you don’t actually get to attend.</p>
<p>This remaster, however, emphasizes the bustle of the congregation, lending the proceedings a you-are-there intimacy. You can hear every cough and mutter, every rifle of a Bible page, and every amen. In this vivid setting, the songs take on new power. Pervis’s recitation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"">Hank Williams</a>’ ""The Funeral"" sounds more intensely melancholy, as though he is not quite convinced of God’s mysterious motivations but is surrendering to Him nonetheless. You can hear Pops joking with his son-in-law just before he launches into ""Samson and Delilah"", and his good spirits inject the song with a vivid snap.</p>
<p>And this version restores the original sequencing, so that ""Freedom Highway"" is immediately preceded by ""We Shall Overcome"", which was a familiar standard that had taken on new relevance for African Americans during the 1960s. It’s a sly bit of programming by Pops, as it primes the audience to respond enthusiastically to a tune they do not know. Yet, ""Freedom Highway"" is a very different song, one that is less concerned with someday and more interested in today. It was Pops’ way of marking a victory, of saying they were already in the process of overcoming.</p>
<p>Even if he was often overshadowed by his daughter Mavis, whose voice often sounded like the hand of God parting the clouds, Pops was definitely the leader of the group and the head of the family. Even as they won mainstream success, trading choir robes for Afros and churches for concert halls, he kept them rooted in gospel and focused on a spiritual message. He also became an influence on several generations of guitarists—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16022-robbie-robertson/"">Robbie Robertson</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"">the Band</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5958-john-fogerty/"">John Fogerty</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8318-creedence-clearwater-revival/"">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>—who mimicked Pops’s nimble melodic lines and distinctive tremolo. Shortly before he died in 2000, he recorded a handful of new and old songs, just him and his guitar, and he must have been pleased with the results, because he entrusted the tapes with his daughters with the request, ""Don’t lose this.""</p>
<p>Mavis held on to them for 15 years, before asking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4314-jeff-tweedy/"">Jeff Tweedy</a> to complete them. To his credit the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> frontman brings to these songs the same restraint he showed on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14666-you-are-not-alone/"">You Are Not Alone</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18220-mavis-staples-one-true-vine/"">One True Vine</a></i>. He never crowds the performances with extraneous elements or modern touches; in fact, he is largely invisible on <i>Don’t Lose This</i>, occasionally playing bass and generally trusting Pops and his guitar to speak as clearly now as they did in 1998 or in 1965. <a href=""http://spencertweedy.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spencer Tweedy</a> plays drums on a few songs and proves himself to be as sensitive a sideman here as he did on last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19682-tweedy-sukierae/"">Sukierae</a></i>. His beats on ""No News Is Good News"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17285-pops-staples-somebody-was-watching/"">""Somebody Was Watching""</a> have a textural quality that accentuates the songs’ genial funk, and he knows exactly where to put the downbeat so that it complements Pops’ vocals. Spencer may be one of the best and most interesting drummers around, but he also knows this is someone else’s show.</p>
<p>As a result, <i>Don’t Lose This</i> sounds like an excellent entry point for newcomers and casual fans, a gateway to exploring the Staples’ vast catalog. Without sounding like a career retrospective, the album revisits the straightforward gospel of the '50s and '60s as well as the sunshine funk of the '70s, all the while playing up the humane optimism in Pops’ vocals. Songs like ""Sweet Home"" and ""Love on My Side"" may depict men at their lowest points—steeped in self-pity, pickled with booze, distant from God—but they are cautionary tales: Any of us could end up in a similar situation, lonely and despairing but never undeserving of redemption.</p>
<p>Still, this is a Pops album in name only. At its core, it may be the final Staple Singers record. His children—including Cleotha, who died in 2013—feature prominently on many of these songs, harmonizing as sweetly as ever in the background and occasionally even taking lead. It’s bracing to hear them sing together again, especially on a song like ""Sweet Home"", which plays up their individual styles. Pops’ vocals are steady and measured, exuding the quiet authority of a man confident that he’ll see heaven. But Mavis’ voice flutters around his in a perfectly controlled gospel melisma that mimics the motion and expressive tone of a reed instrument. For a lesser singer, her performance might sound ostentatious or overbearing, but for Mavis, it sounds natural and fluid, a perfect complement to her father’s performance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the standout on <i>Don’t Lose This</i> is ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"", an old Baptist hymn popularized in the 1930s by another pop music patriarch, A.P. Carter. The Staples covered the song in the '60s, but 40 years will change anyone’s perspective on life and death. Chronicling the funeral of a beloved parent, the song poses the important question, Will the bonds of family persist beyond this world? On the new version Pops manages to gently interpret the song, singing not from the point of view of a child losing a parent, but from the perspective of a parent singing to the children he will leave behind. Even if it’s not the last song on the album, it sounds like a final statement, one last bit of wisdom from a man who showed us the spiritual potential in pop music of all kinds.</p></div>"|20155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20155-freedom-highway-completedont-lose-this/|7.9|Stephen M.

Despite living in the land of PacSun and surfboards, something about being front-and-center as the masses descend on California beaches makes a portion of the city's youth culture push hard in the opposite direction, to leather jackets and combat boots. Perhaps the reverse dynamic is at work in Northern Europe, where over the last decade DJs and producers have gravitated towards heliocentric sounds, the soundtrack to an idealized beachfront lifestyle courtesy of kids raised in the land of the ice and snow.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A perfect example is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5126-studio/"">Studio</a>'s 2006 LP <i>West Coast</i>. Since the Swedish duo of Rasmus Hägg and Daniel Lissvik first hit the world like a modest cult comet, the Balearic beach bum aesthetic they popularized reverberated across hip dancefloors and afterparties worldwide and inspired countless imitators. But <i>West Coast </i>is more than its position at the crest of a breaking trend-wave: like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29721-dj-harvey/"">DJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Sarcastic Study Masters Vol. 2</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27705-lindstrom-prins-thomas/"">Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas</a>' epic BBC Essential Mix, it epitomized a moment, yet sustains as great escapist entertainment years later.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Since its release, Lissvik has retained an active résumé, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39Iju9PYNE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixing</a>, producing for other artists (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5330-taken-by-trees/"">Taken by Trees</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5198-young-galaxy/"">Young Galaxy</a>), and recording under various pseudonyms, as he did for last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20107-meditation/""><i>Meditation</i></a> under the moniker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32682-atelje/"">Atelje</a>. But he hasn't unleashed a full solo project since 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12653-7-trx-intermission/""><i>7 Trx + Intermission</i></a>. <i>Shuvit! </i>is the first release in the lead-up to his second official full-length, and much as Atelje promised a return to the spiritual center of <i>West Coast</i>, <i>Shuvit!</i> tackles that sound in all its unpredictable, dubby disco glory. Well, maybe not glory: if Studio's biggest album both epitomized its time and transcended it, <i>Shuvit!</i> does neither—although it does neither in a very pleasant way.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The aims and accomplishments of this EP are modest. After a superfluous intro track, the rubbery funk of ""Airwalk"" is an archetypal Lissvik record. Sound design is of foremost concern: much like his fellow European house and techno producers, each drum snaps with purposeful distinctiveness. But unlike the average German techno auteur, Lissvik seeks more organic instrumentation; bass and guitar strings reverberate and the beat has a crunchy texture. Each song is more likely to recall a drum circle than a nightclub. The most ""artificial"" instrument are vocal patches; its aim is less dancefloor futurism than a party after the power goes out.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">While ""Airwalk"" relies on a straightforward groove and low-key payoff, ""Shuvit!"" is the EP's stronger track. Underneath quarter-note doo-doo-doo-doo vocals, a fidgety groove reminiscent of People's Choice's 1975 disco record <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJlpMD7PH1Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Do It Any Way You Wanna""</a> unfolds into a flute breakdown before a new melodic theme begins. In construction, it recalls the kind of purposeful meandering compositions of <i>West Coast</i>. It may not be as revelatory as that record's ""Life's a Beach!"", but the song creates a warm and comfortable world in which to let time slip away.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><span>In the middle of the decade, this new Balearic music felt counterintuitive</span>. A new school of producers embraced unfashionable sounds, calling upon Mediterranean dance history as a new source of cool. As the years slip by and these innovations enter the slipstream, the trade in new Balearic music approximates the '90s infatuation with trip-hop. An intersection of soundtrack music, kraut, disco, dub, '70s album rock, and electronic dance music, the style is worldly and referential, finding coherence in the spaces where old genres intersect. The end result—most of the time—is a kind of upscale lifestyle music for cosmopolitan, historically-minded listeners, where artists toy with ambiance in an effort to tap into the mystique of the past, the foreign, and the exotic.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Which is a long way of saying that sometimes the line between ""comfortable"" and ""boring"" is thin. On the one hand, it's hard to fault Lissvik for running on a track he knows: The ground may be worn down, but it's the kind of idea that bears repeating. Anyone unfamiliar with Studio's history will no doubt find <i>Shuvit!</i> pleasant. But even by those standards, nothing here is as transcendent as, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHiqPG0526U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Inspector Norse""</a>—a late entrant into the Balearic banger sweepstakes. If you liked <i>West Coast</i> and want a couple of b-sides, check out <i>Shuvit!</i>. If you haven't heard <i>West Coast</i>, buy it.</p></div>"|20254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20254-shuvit-ep/|6.5|David Drake

He records under the name Axis: Sova, which stands as a solo project in the studio but morphs into a full band on the road, and in either formation the most interesting element is easily his guitar. When there is percussion on<i> Early Surf</i> (his second LP, and his first for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a>'s <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/products?filter_label=GOD"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">God? Records</a> imprint), it's minimal, synthetic, and purely functional. He's only two full-lengths in, but he's already established a reputation for buzzing, unsteady, occasionally muffled psych music spiked with a few giant guitar solos for good measure. He's established a formula—""avant garde yet burly""—that he delivers once again with <i>Early Surf</i>.<br/><br/> The trouble with this sort of psychedelia is that it sometimes veers toward abstraction and facelessness. That's definitely a concern here, as Sova's somewhat of an elusive figure in his music. He's the guitar-wielding figure on the album's cover, his features blotted out by blinding light, singing poems that address uncertainty and unclear identities. His distorted and effects-laden vocals cut off words, and he occasionally comes across as dour and reserved, but his oblique storytelling (with references, for example, to the overpowering nature of artificial light and television) and amorphous guitar leads hint at a larger aesthetic unity. On ""Ask Me About My Smell"", in which a woman named Heather does, indeed, ask him about his smell, he steps away from his heavier persona and lets a sense of humor shine through.<br/><br/> <i>Early Surf</i>'s best moments brim with potential. ""Fractal Ancestry"" shows a guitarist and songwriter unafraid to explore different approaches: Over seven minutes, Sova's guitar melody operates within a loose structure, but things always seem to be in a state of flux. His solos guide the song down alternate routes as he continually shifts the balance from the right speaker to the left, peppered throughout with sci-fi sound effects. Again, his approach mirrors his lyrics: ""Open the door, let it close behind you. What do you see now? It's just another door."" At his best, Sova seems like the type of guy who could endlessly swing open new doors to unexpected places. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, a few of the songs just don't have legs. The two-minute track ""Secret Hand"" seems to be building to something enormous before it just sort of fizzles out. It happens again on the album's title track: Sova named his band after <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis:_Bold_as_Love"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a classic Jimi Hendrix LP</a>, and for a brief moment at the start of the song, it seems like he's going to do his namesake proud by springboarding off his earworm and heading into the stratosphere. Instead, he just stays the repetitive course, only changing his approach in the song's final seconds. Sova's undeniably the sort of guy you want to hear go long—the lengthier jams are undeniably the best. When he's not going on an epic journey, however, he winds up spinning in place.</p></div>"|20169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20169-early-surf/|6.6|Evan Minsker

Damon is a poet and writer (and an occasional Pitchfork contributor) while Naomi is a photographer and graphic designer whose visual design skills have always been an integral part of the duo’s work, dating back to her album designs for their beloved group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"">Galaxie 500</a>. In addition to operating the <a href=""http://www.20-20-20.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">20/20/20</a> record label and <a href=""http://exactchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Exact Change</a> small press, in recent years Naomi has branched out into directing stylish and evocative <a href=""http://www.naomivision.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">music videos</a> for such artists as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32464-elisa-ambrogio/"">Elisa Ambrogio</a>.</p>
<p>So it seems like a very organic progression that Naomi has now directed <i>Fortune</i>, her first short film<i>.</i> Though the film itself is silent, it arrives paired with a full-length soundtrack of new songs by Damon &amp; Naomi, which can give it the essential feel of a 30-minute music video. The film and its music, naturally enough, work best in combination and enjoying them together (<a href=""http://www.naomivision.com/shortfilm#1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">currently available for free</a>) is an experience well worth the half-hour devotion of your time and attention. As is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj-GZJhfBmI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">often the case</a> the film itself feels incomplete without its musical accompaniment, whereas the soundtrack does function as a short but coherent and satisfying stand-alone collection of songs.</p>
<p>The <i>Fortune</i> soundtrack is Damon &amp; Naomi’s first album of new music since 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15379-false-beats-and-true-hearts/""><i>False Beats and True Hearts</i></a> and, if you want to get technical about it, their first as an actual duo since their <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a> work in the early 1990s. After a long and fruitful series of collaborations with guitarist Michio Kurihara of Ghost, here the two play all the instruments themselves. The music is characteristically quiet and introspective but, as with much of their work with Kurihara, more lush and enveloping than the spacious Galaxie 500 sound. Using little more than acoustic guitar, keyboards and Krukowski’s jazz-tinged drumming, they have crafted arrangements for these 11 pieces that sound remarkably full-bodied. And it would appear that the natural constraints of the soundtrack form have worked to their advantage. The songs are concise and focused, hitting their melodic or lyrical marks and then quickly moving to the next scene without getting weighted down by repetition or digression.</p>
<p>The film, which stars Norman von Holtzendorff, centers on a man coping with the death of his father, a successful portrait painter, and the conflicted artistic and personal legacy he has left behind. This is deeply intimate material for Yang, who had recently lost her own artist father and was left to sort through a storage space of his artwork and what she refers to in her director’s statement as ""the aftermath of his very flawed parenting."" This unavoidably gives both film and soundtrack an elegiac tone, with many of the album’s lyrics reflecting on the various burdens of mourning and memory.</p>
<p>As has long been their practice, the duo swap lead vocal duties back and forth and join together in casual harmonies, but given the project’s backdrop perhaps it is unsurprising that those songs sung primarily by Yang—""It’s Over"", ""The North Light""—are the most immediately striking. The critical quibbles that have followed Damon &amp; Naomi throughout their career can still be applied: Their hushed voices remain pretty, but not dazzling, and their cozy music never strays much beyond the comfort zone that they firmly established a couple of decades ago. Especially when taken in conjunction with Yang’s film, however, <i>Fortune </i>packs a subtle yet undeniable emotive force whose impact can linger long after the projector has gone dark.</p></div>"|20258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20258-fortune/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

Ghost’s storytelling had certainly been stronger in the past, but at least he was spinning his conceptual tales over murky, time-faded R&amp;B-noir. After further collaborations with groups carrying Real Instruments, like the déjà vu of last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20052-36-seasons/""><i>36 Seasons</i></a>, where Ghost teamed up with Brooklyn funk band the Revelations for another detail-scarce Tony Starks yarn, the novelty has worn off, and it’s easy to start asking whether Ghost still has it.</p>
<p>Toronto jazz-funk dons BADBADNOTGOOD are a good fit, ably replicating the kind of gritty ’70s pulp-paperback breaks Ghostface has long favored. But <i>Sour Soul</i> could have every musician who ever played with the J.B.’s backing him up and it still wouldn’t obscure the fact that he’s slacking on the mic. His voice is still his, and it’s difficult if not impossible for Ghostface to actually <i>sound</i> bored. But if you gravitated to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"">DOOM</a> team-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58006-ghostface-killah-and-doom-reunite-for-ray-gun/"">""Ray Gun""</a> just because <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NroRvYrJ2lQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Angels"" was hot</a> and still hold out hope that <i>Swift &amp; Changeable</i> will see light of day, the disappointment will hit hard: ""Back in black, it’s your local superhero from the hood/ Ironman Starks got the good/ Not that good good like Snoop/ I bulletproofed the coupe/ Polished up the suit and gathered the troops."" He goes on to make a <i>Matrix</i> reference in the year 2015 and states ""Ain’t a bird or a plane, it’s a ghost on the mic."" A ghost of himself, maybe.</p>
<p>Ghostface gets outshone every time there’s a guest verse—a concentrated dose of DOOM wiseassedness on ""Ray Gun""; Elzhi punchlining all over ""Gunshowers""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31352-tree/"">Tree</a> rasping with a thousand-yard stare on ""Street Knowledge""; the continued lights-out rampage streak of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a> on ""Six Degrees""—but the feeling that he can barely carry this record on the mic goes beyond that. His flair for narrative and knack for offbeat observational details are nearly gone; pop-culture punchlines land with a thud and play more like spot-the-reference jokes than evocative analogies—""my clan is Bravehearts, you move like Paul Blart"" on the title cut is probably the most egregious example.</p>
<p>Ghostface still knows how to balance his most well-known facets: the bombastic comic-book hero, the ruthless criminal mastermind, and the independent philosophical thinker. Ghost working through these notions in such close quarters doesn’t really feel like a personality crisis; he’s always been equally convincing as a man dispensing advice on keeping your drug distribution efforts low-key and your spiritual mind on the right path a verse or two apart. Even if the language isn’t anywhere near as transporting as when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3637-fishscale/""><i>Fishscale</i></a> jumped from dope tales to love songs to underwater revelations, there are at least hidden dimensions under the all-too-matter-of-fact statements.</p>
<p>The lackluster lines are even more of a letdown given the strength of the music. BADBADNOTGOOD’s arrangements are the most immersive yet in this three-album run of live-band Ghostface. The core trio leans towards <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"">RZA</a>’s old Morricone-via-Stax waypoints here and there, then warps them into something more enigmatic and heated—basslines and drums creep and skulk instead of just booming, string arrangements recall the late '60s heyday of David Axelrod turning the Wall of Sound into cresting liquid waves. The instrumental version of this album is going to make a lot of SoundCloud-bound demo-tapers lose their minds trying to get their turns in.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: The presence of BADBADNOTGOOD and some show-stealing guest verses are reason enough to face the prospect of Ghostface in second gear. There isn’t even that much to weather, what with the whole record being all of 33 minutes, with only nine tracks actually featuring a Ghostface verse. Both the scant material and under-inspired lyricism are symptoms of the same problem: a dearth of unexpected ideas from an MC once seemingly capable of endless ones. Ghost’s done worse, but he used to be so excitingly unpredictable. Now you pretty much know what you’re going to get.</p></div>"|20196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20196-sour-soul/|6.2|Nate Patrin

Not only is <i>Picture You</i> one of the surprisingly rare rock records of recent vintage drawing legitimate, discernible inspiration from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin</a>, Gunrup just so happens to be influenced by the same exact songs Kozelek namechecked on his spellbinding autobiography <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8cklFZ3sA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Watched the Film ‘The Song Remains the Same’""</a>. There’s the Fender Rhodes hum of ""No Quarter"", as well as the capability to touch on jazz and prog-rock without being ""jazzy"" or ""proggy"". The Amazing spend vast stretches of time strolling the verdant expanses of ""Rain Song"", as well as basking in the glimmering acoustic sunrises of ""Bron-Yr-Aur"". And Gunrup’s vocals are that of a very melancholy kid mesmerized by everything, one who did see Zep as gods, but benevolent and nurturing ones<span>—</span>more Pan and Demeter than Dionysus.</p>
<p>The end result is a record that reverently draws from a dazzling array of past masters only to short-circuit critical capacity. Discussion of <i>Picture You</i> can only end up with slack-jawed remarks about how goddamn pretty it is. Stranger still is how the adverbs you’d feel tempted to latch onto that superlative somehow makes that seem like a bad thing: ""obscenely pretty,"" ""ridiculously beautiful,"" etc.  But the Amazing specialize in a beauty that isn’t airbrushed or slick or antiseptic, the kind captured by lad mags or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpmmeT69cE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trevor Horn</a>, everything exaggerated to emphasize its status as eye or ear candy. Nor is it smudged or vaporous like shoegaze. It doesn’t even make a full attempt at an au naturel realism of folk or the otherworldliness of psych-rock, though it does touch on those aspects. <i>Picture You</i> is elemental rock<span>—</span>earthy, molten, aquatic, but using each of their qualities to soothe rather than destroy or intimidate.</p>
<p>Opener ""Broken"" is the Amazing at their most grand, but not <i>grandiose</i><span>—</span>the guitars dip in the same deep water as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">the Cure</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition""><i>Disintegration</i></a>, while Moussa Fadera plays his drums with the activity of Keith Moon or John Bonham. Yet, the guitars merely come off as being coated with morning dew, every cymbal splash sounds like it’s releasing a light ocean spray. Even when ""Safe Island"" ends with nearly three minutes of blistering harmonic feedback, it’s never meant to overwhelm, it’s more the encroaching low heat of a sweat lodge. This part is notably absent from the ""single"" version.</p>
<p>The Amazing’s previous album was called <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16842-gentle-stream/"">Gentle Stream</a></i> and very much earned that title; this one is more like a lazy river<span>—</span>you know, the weekend summer outing where an inner tube with a cooler of beer drags behind, long stretches of a calming buzz that evolves into some serious disorientation only after you figure out where you’ve been the past six minutes. This is pretty much the whole point of ""To Keep It Going"", where Gunrup repeats the title and only the title for its five-minute duration. <i>Picture You</i> doesn’t jam or meander, it drifts knowing its final destination is preordained<span>—</span>“Fryshusfunk” and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17200-the-amazing-picture-you/"">title track</a> take a few minutes to commit to basic song structures before getting into vast stretches of lead guitar interplay that never quite becomes <i>soloing</i>. The Amazing <i>can</i> be concise, though prototypical psych-folk fusions like ""Tell Them You Can’t Leave"" turn out to be the parts where <i>Picture You</i> feels like it loses focus.</p>
<p>There <i>is </i>focus here, though it's hard to elucidate: While the Amazing could certainly find themselves winning over the same festival crowds swooning to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"">Tame Impala</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/""><i>Lonerism</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">the War on Drugs</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19094-the-war-on-drugs-lost-in-the-dream/""><i>Lost in the Dream</i></a>, what <i>Picture You</i> lacks compared to those albums is, well, a frame. Or at least the knowledge of who ""you"" is. Gunrup doesn’t commit his lyrics to the credits, and he even admits this on the <a href=""http://www.theamazing.se/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">band's website</a>: ""I have no idea how to describe the songs. If you theorize about the songs, it ruins the tension and passion. Just shut the fuck up and play, but play good.""</p>
<p>In other words, he might have no better idea than I do about what these songs are actually about. And I certainly have no idea. ""The Headless Boy"" is the drumless acoustic ballad where the lyrics are most audible and it’s as slippery as the song called ""Fryshusfunk"". But during the <i>Meddle</i>-esque ""Circles"", Dunrup mentions watching <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> <i>II</i>, whose soundtrack contains songs such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vldh7oQD-a4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Want Your Sex""</a> and Bob Seger’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3MTFJz50qc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shakedown""</a>, which exist in a completely different solar system than the one occupied by ""Circles"". But the impression given by Gunrup is that the same headspace that would lead someone to watching <i>Beverly Hills Cop II</i> in its entirety is similar to the one that’s amenable to <i>Picture You</i><span>—</span>a fugue state where you somehow manage to be happily committed to your own incapacitation.</p></div>"|20095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20095-picture-you/|7.5|Ian Cohen

Back in 2011, Joker's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16003-the-vision/""><i>The Vision</i></a> was a pop-move faceplant that squandered the momentum he'd built off his early singles. Faithful still copped the instrumentals, but a cred renewal project seemed like the best next move, and a couple fairly strong EPs on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kapsize"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kapsize</a> seemed to stave off the worst fears. 2013's <i>The Face Off</i> and 2014's <i>Head Top</i> were back to the wheelhouse—heaving bass wobbles that stayed sinuous even when they sounded like groaning crushed metal, melodies that reinjected some of grime's heightened delirium into the UK bass continuum, and drums that flipped from leadfoot stomping to counter-rhythmic intricacy without stopping up the motions. If it was a comfort zone, well, more artists should be comfortable bringing stuff the caliber of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15206-joker-newham-generals/"">""Newham Generals""</a> or <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jokerkapsize/deserted-island"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Deserted Island""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But sometimes that artistic urge to push outside those boundaries comes back, maybe in a different enough form that it feels like those previous pitfalls can be avoided. Sure, a few new ones could spring up, but that's the way it goes, right? Part of the hype around </span><i>The Mainframe</i><span> is that it's intended as an album-</span><span>qua-</span><span>album, a non-stop listen that only reveals its full meaning and breadth once you've run through its entire length without stopping. You're welcome to try, but you're also welcome to pick your own spot to give up and jump to the next track. It could be one of the moments where Joker's knack for joyously martial melody gets run through a wringer of action-blockbuster pianos-and-strings that reveals just how many of his compositional strengths actually rely on nuance and negative space—and what happens when those tendencies are crowded out. It could also very likely be the moment on ""Lucy"" where Sam Frank's squeaky falsetto belts out the line ""let me be your little honky boy.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's a skeptic's worst case scenario, all that orchestral grandeur and the threats of </span><i>Vision</i><span>-ary pop-vocal overload. But it's not like Joker's forgotten how to smartly exploit the push-pull/stop-start dynamic of a two-step beat, or balance out uppercut chords with slick melodic counterpoints. Even at its most prog-bombastic, it flows well and doesn't lose sight of the need to bump: The seamless opening one-two of ""Intro"" and ""Boss Mode"" promises symphonic piano noodling and arena-filling synth arpeggios but delivers something more compactly driven to head-nods than arm sweeps. Basslines stay future-mindedly filthy in modular ways—there are these shrugging hiccups on the frantic tension of ""Boss Mode"" that resurface on the melancholy uplift of ""Mixed Emotions""; hydraulic-press background hums bolster the high ends on moodier cuts like ""Mahogany""; acidic hip-hop synth squelches that immolate lesser trap-peddlers on sight push a jumpy interplay with precision snares on ""Midnight"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Think of </span><i>The Mainframe </i><span>as his own effort to do widescreen R&amp;B and it makes a lot more sense, even if the moments that can stand toe-to-toe with the best of that milieu are scarce. The voices that hold the most impact tend to be the ones chopped into wordless choral exclamations in the instrumentals—the </span><span>oh-oh-oh</span><span>s of ""Midnight"" rendering human ecstasy and synaptic synth jolts as the same impulse, or the recurring hum in ""Mahogany"" that sinks into and emerges from a parallel guitar strum. The one actual guest singer who really seems to fit is Rochelle Perts, the onetime Dutch ""X Factor"" winner whose lush intensity and sweet-sounding frustration on the anti-platonic ""Love"" stands strong in the face of dizzying seesaw bass waves. On the other hand, the pianos-and-handclaps backbone of ""Wise Enough"" needs more than Zak Abel overexerting his bland-in-any-octave voice and some chords from the ""Psychedelic Runway"" parts bin to say what the surrounding instrumentals do without vocals. And I should probably mention that aside from Sam Frank's ""little honky boy"" thing ""Lucy"" </span><span>also </span><span>contains the line ""I'm the bear in your cave, girl,"" so there's that.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>With the gloss and brass-section pomp, </span><i>The Mainframe </i><span>feels like a more logical big-move progression for someone who turned heads with a flip of the Bond-pastiche theme to ""</span><span>Metal Gear Solid 3""</span><span> on </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=538MOdGJ5xo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Snake Eater""</span></a><span> back in 2008. It might still mortify some of his more purist fans, but there's little on this record that a few instrumental-version substitutions wouldn't fix. And as another step towards finding a place in a crossover space where he could easily put his imprint on hip-hop, R&amp;B, pop, or UK bass, it makes for a far better audition reel than </span><i>The</i> <i>Vision</i>.<i></i><i> </i><span> No need to regroup after this one—there's more evolutionary promise cresting ahead.</span></p></div>"|20195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20195-the-mainframe/|6.8|Nate Patrin

Carey|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Jagjaguwar']|2015-02-16 00:00:00|2015|2016-06-11 16:14:48.275829|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1jxszfgfncw.1.6:0.1.0.$20158/=1$20158.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p class=""p1"">As exciting as the term sounds, a supermoon is a fairly common occurrence, an illusion caused when a full or new moon happens to coincide with the moon’s closest approach to Earth. Basically, it means the moon looks a bit bigger than usual. While that might not seem significant to most people, it’s the type of phenomenon Sean Carey pays close attention to. Even more so than his brother in flannel Justin Vernon, whom he backs in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>, Carey syncs his music to the rhythms of nature. His writing process frequently involves hiking or fishing, and in his spare time he photographs mountainous terrains and forests, <a href=""http://logger.believermag.com/post/81494654438/this-series-of-black-and-white-photographs-share"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">likening the images to his songs</a>. Yet for all his wilderness worship, there’s often been a disconnect between Carey’s naturalistic mindset and his production-heavy recordings. Both of his albums were pieced together from meticulous overdubs, while his 2012 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16587-s-carey-hoyas-ep/""><i>Hoyas</i></a> EP pulsed with electronic texture. His songs sought to capture nature’s warmth, but they wore the stamp of cold technology.<br/> <br/> With his <i>Supermoon</i> EP, recorded during a supermoon last August, Carey aims to bring his music closer to the natural world that inspired it, scaling back his precise arrangements to let the songs speak for themselves. That’s a noble goal, if not necessarily a wise one. Last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19143-s-carey-range-of-light/""><i>Range of Light</i></a> proved Carey a stronger composer than lyricist, and although he’s got a capable enough falsetto, his voice never demands the spotlight the way Vernon’s does. So his decision to dedicate four of <i>Supermoon</i>’s six songs to downsized remakes of album tracks is a head scratcher: He’s removing much of what made these songs interesting in the first place. ""We Fell"", a highlight from Carey’s 2010 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14569-all-we-grow/""><i>All We Grow</i></a>, is reprised here without its radiant choral swells, while <i>Range of Light</i>’s luxuriously jazzy ""Fire-scene"" is reworked as a lonely piano dirge. They’re still the same songs; there’s just less of them now.<br/> <br/> EPs made up mostly of alternate versions are usually a tough sell, but if done right they can free an artist to play against type in amusing ways. The most successful are the ones that drastically reinvent their material, recasting, for instance, rock songs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14584-the-electronic-anthology-project/"">as synth-pop songs</a>, synth-pop songs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2294-notorious-lightning-and-other-works-ep/"">as rock songs</a>, or busy twee-punk <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14522-alls-well-that-ends-ep/"">as slightly less busy acoustic twee-punk</a>. But <i>Supermoon</i> never takes those kinds of leaps. If it’s been a while since you’ve heard the original versions of these songs you might not notice any differences. Even ""Bullet Proof… I Wish I Was"", the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> cover that closes the EP, clings stubbornly close to its source material. Rather than pick a Radiohead song he could deconstruct, Carey started with one that was already broken down.<br/> <br/> Just one of <i>Supermoon</i>’s revised takes improves on the original: ""In the Stream"", a lovely number that lost the plot on <i>All We Grow</i> during a busy climax. Freed from the clutter, the song’s rueful sentiment comes through much more clearly. One marginally improved song isn’t enough to justify an EP, though, nor is <i>Supermoon</i>’s lone original, its title track, a solo piano offering with no secrets to reveal. Like the rest of the EP, the song radiates tranquility and comfort without doing much else. Carey has rarely sounded more in his element. Unfortunately, he’s also never sounded less distinguished.</p></div>"|20158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20158-supermoon-ep/|4.8|Evan Rytlewski

He then singles out British-born singer Steve (neé White) Spacek’s ""Dolar"" on his lone solo album and his selection of one of Dilla’s trickiest beats, which reduces Philly soul singer Billy Paul’s ""Let the Dollar Circulate"" to a looped syllable and a shoe-in-drier stumble of toms. But Spacek sounded surefooted on such slippery terrain. And whether working alongside the trio Spacek, as half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29608-africa-hitech/"">Africa Hitech</a>, or else on his own as Black Pocket, each one of Spacek's projects danced around R&amp;B, soul, hip-hop, broken beat, drum'n'bass, and grime, without ever planting solidly down in one. No matter the setting, Spacek’s falsetto was unfussy and at ease, evoking comparison to what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> might have sounded like in the MPC era.</span></p>
<p>But it’s been six years since we last heard from Spacek under his own name or as Black Pocket. On <i>Modern Streets</i>, his low-key, nonchalant return—this time as Beat Spacek—he sounds unhurried and casual—it's an album made in those brief moments after being roused from an afternoon nap. Spacek purportedly crafted the entire album on iPad and iPhone apps rather than in a full-fledged recording studio, giving a sweatpants-and-Adidas slippers vibe to <i>Modern Streets</i>. Perhaps the closest parallel might be to those<a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/hnigatu/erykah-badus-vines-are-as-weird-and-delightful-as-you-would#.yq0klwXJO"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Vines</a> that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah Badu </a>has been uploading of late, playful, homespun and strange (and hopefully teasing a new record at some point). It makes Spacek’s 13 songs feel more like demos and sketches, little blips of songs abutting longer selections, most of them favoring blurriness over distinction.</p>
<p>Spacek’s ability to breeze over hectic beats is evident from opener ""I Wanna Know"", a snare drum skitter right out of an old jungle track sliding beneath him, while on ""Tonight"", he whispers sweet nothings about being VIP over a flipped Afrobeat sample. At moments like this, Spacek’s penchant for twisting beats feels like child’s play, most evidently on the halting claps and bleeps of ""Gotta Get Some Music"", where he and his kids titter about that very phrase. And amid the shortwave squeals of ""Back to School"" are strange background vocals that might make you wonder if Spacek has been listening to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> or else early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>.</p>
<p>Most tracks on the first half clock in under four-minutes, but as the songs stretch out longer on the album’s back half, there’s not enough structure to support them. And midway through, as Spacek’s slender falsetto stretches to the breaking point, the slightness of some lyrics also become evident. Funky as the leaky faucet and thrummed kora that loop through the single ""Alone in Da Sun"" are, it does little in its six minutes. Some songs wiggle in place, as on ""There Is a Love"", and no matter the theme of ""Stand Firm"", the backing squishes like Nerf underfoot. As we celebrate J Dilla’s birth and death this week and lament what might have come from the man in the future, it feels like Spacek—despite some bright moments here—might have also benefited from another challenge.</p></div>"|20226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20226-modern-streets/|6.7|Andy Beta

It wasn’t so much that its sound scanned as ""'90s"", though vocalist Nicole Miglis’ debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> in both tone and phrasing sometimes made it feel that way. It was more that the album <i>as</i> an album hearkened back to a slower time, suggesting patience and trust that enough people would want to sit down and let the music wash over them.</p>
<p>Speaking of the '90s, one music trend from the era remembered less than fondly is the remix album. In the second half the decade, when CD sales were on the rise, file sharing was not yet an issue, and electronic music was gaining currency; remixes were, I guess, a way for bands to gain traction with people who were growing accustomed to music samples and sequences. Depending on which label you found yourself on, it became almost expected to follow up a successful album with a collection of remixes. A parallel for Hundred Waters would have been an artist like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3263-the-pastels/"">the Pastels</a>, whose 1998 album <i>Illumination</i> was re-worked a year later as the remix collection <i>Illuminati</i>. The commissioned producers found on that record, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2282-kid-loco/"">Kid Loco</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/832-cornelius/"">Cornelius</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2716-john-mcentire/"">John McEntire</a>, were more or less a Who’s Who of the late '90s remix record scene. There are no equivalents to these names in 2015 because in the mp3 era indie rock remixes pretty much lost whatever credibility they once had, as they were (and are) clearly and obviously put together to keep a band’s name active in the online press. A remix included on a real album and pressed to vinyl at least pretends to matter; one blasted with a press release with new tour dates is forgotten almost immediately.</p>
<p>Hundred Waters released <i>Moon</i> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>’s <a href=""http://owsla.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OWSLA</a> imprint. But despite presumably easy access to EDM bass-drop royalty, no one here tries to turn their songs into teeth-grinding summer festival anthems. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3328-plaid/"">Plaid</a> aside, the remixers lean obscure. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31182-brandt-brauer-frick/"">Brandt Brauer Frick</a> turns ""Murmurs"" into a dark, throbbing bit of noir with a two-step break, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30105-shigeto/"">Shigeto</a> strips ""Cavity"" back to just voice and thumb piano to beguiling effect, and Alex Zhang Hungtai of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29375-dirty-beaches/"">Dirty Beaches</a> does his thing to ""Broken Blue"", basically sounding like he put a boombox in the window of his apartment, hit Play, and recorded the sound from across the room. Those are all highlights. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31588-illangelo/"">Illangelo</a>’s ""Confessional Remix"" of ""Innocent"", on the other hand, with its pitch-shifted ""ghostly R&amp;B"" vocals, sounded dated before he’d saved the .wav file on his computer. There are also three re-works by the band themselves. The opening ""Show Me Love"" is one of the set’s best moments, featuring just Miglis and piano, while ""No Sound"" gets an awkward arrangement from the band’s Paul Giese and Zach Tetreault including a surge of brass at its close. Trayer Tryon’s ""Seven White Horses"" is the record’s one stab at dance music proper, amplifying the original’s stuttering rhythm and adding a 4/4 kick, and it’s mostly a mess.</p>
<p>Even with its weak points, <i>The Moon Rang Like a Bell (Remixed)</i> is charming in part because of the sincerity with which it's presented. The remixes are sequenced in the same order as the album proper, for one, suggesting that it is meant to be absorbed as a whole. There are no repetitions of individual tracks, and for the most part, the remixes are low-key and tasteful, hewing closely to the group’s preferred mode, suggesting an ""alternate version"" of the record more than a mishmash collection of promo detritus. All of which combines to make <i>The Moon Rang Like a Bell (Remixed)</i> an unlikely album that is much better than it could have been, even if, ultimately, its utility <i>as</i> an album is less clear. Will I ever reach for this over the original? Never. But it’s not impossible to imagine someone out there doing so once in a while.

But who cares when the record holds together this well? It <i>feels</i> like an album, which, in the post-format day and age, is the only guideline that matters. And it certainly doesn't feel like a debut—at least, not in the sense of baby steps or half-measures. The New York electronic musician's vision is fully formed here, and it's original enough for him to stand out from the scads of producers trying similar hybrids of house, techno, and beat-up home-listening fare.</p>
<p>That confidence is all the more striking given that Naples is a relative newcomer. He put out his first record in 2012, on <a href=""http://mistersaturdaynight.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mister Saturday Night</a>, the label arm of a popular New York party series. Strikingly, ""Mad Disrespect"" was the first song he had ever completed—not bad at all, given how effortlessly it flitted between the cut-up soul of artists like Andrés and the slightly off-kilter vibe of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"">Caribou</a> in dancefloor mode. Since then, he's recorded a handful of singles and EPs that have built upon the foundation established by his debut. They've all tended towards snapping house rhythms marked by flayed hi-hats and nervous, syncopated kick drums; he's fond of chopped-up keys and copious overdrive. Equal parts sweet and gruff, his club tracks are typically as juicy as a bruised blood orange.</p>
<p>But <i>Body Pill</i>, despite the title, swerves away from the club. Its opening track, ""Ris"", opens with two minutes of beatless drones, and the drums-and-synth figure that rises up out of the fog sounds less like dance music than a Casiotone reconstruction of the opening bars of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvDuATZCY8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Teen Age Riot""</a>. ""Abrazo"", which follows, is a proper club track (even if that 3:25 running time may send DJs scrambling to come up with a follow-up before it fades out); its keening string loops and keyboard counterpoints are clearly in the vein of Pépé Bradock or Andrés, and it employs some of the toughest, most declarative drums on the whole record. Still, it doesn't take long to see that Naples' idea of dance music is a little bit different from the norm. The drums are sort of lumpy and disheveled; the hi-hat is turned up a hair too loud, and the snare sticks out like a broken front tooth. All that roughness is a way of balancing out the melancholy strings, but it also highlights the way even the strings are a little bit raw, their fidelity rough and their waveform crudely truncated; if this were a visual collage, there'd be Scotch tape visible over the corners of the picture.</p>
<p>The closing track, ""Miles"", seems like it'll be another of the record's go-to dancefloor cuts, given its overlapping layers of drum machine and sampled percussion and its eyes-closed deep house vibes; it rings like a lawn sprinkler aimed at a gamelan ensemble. But then a curious thing happens: shortly before the three-minute marker, it fades out, the tempo shifts from 120 to 110 beats per minute, and we're ushered out with tapped hi-hats and a tentative, burbling melody, as though someone had stepped on the hose. The rest of the album proceeds along similar lines, in which club-music convention is tweaked ever so slightly, its tropes repurposed for squirrelier aims. ""Changes"" balances absent-minded keys—a tinkly little up-and-down melody, an unbroken chord—with a cutting machine beat that spins idly in place, throwing off sparks. It's tough and drowsy all at once, and so is ""Refugio"", its tarnished counterpoints sounding like a conversation between two lonely robots. Most producers tend to visualize packed dancefloors when they're writing music, but I suspect this one was made with an empty room in mind, given the way its melody scoots like an idle gobo pattern across buffed hardwood. The only club-oriented track here that doesn't work so well is ""Used to Be"", which swathes swaggering, dubstep-inspired bass and drums in rosy <i>Twin Peaks</i> chords. It's not bad, but it feels aimless—even though, ironically, it's one of the record's most clearly defined tracks.</p>
<p>Perhaps he's simply better at abstraction. The drum-free, two-minute ""Pale"" sounds even more like a '70s public-television soundtrack cue than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>'s music does; ""Way Stone"", with its tight ripples of delay, might be sourced from rocks skipped across a still lake. Its wooden lead sounds like a kalimba wrapped in layers of sticky masking tape; at the short track's end, there's a rush of white noise like a seashell being held up to the ear. It's not terribly hard to make music that signifies varying shades of melancholy or unease; ""moody"" seems to be the default setting in dance music these days, from the underground to the main stage. But <i>Body Pill </i>is different: it's moody, but in a way that feels like he's not entirely clear about what the underlying mood really is. And there's an honesty to that. It sounds less like a young producer enjoying the fruits of quick success than a restless experimenter figuring out what to do next. Lucky for us, the woodshed is destination enough.</p></div>"|20075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20075-body-pill/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

But as their albums increasingly become advertorials for their <a href=""http://www.deathbyaudio.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outside business ventures</a> and incapacitating concert experience, Jimmy Buffett might be the more <i>accurate</i> comparison. Can’t knock the hustle, though—APTBS’ rather impressive longevity is due in large part to knowing their audience, and on their fourth LP <i>Transfixiation</i>, the mere titles of ""Now It’s Over"", ""Filling the Void"" and ""I Will Die"" let you know it caters to the indoor sunglasses crowd as expertly as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF4O3Wt_3vo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Too Drunk to Karaoke""</a> and ""Oldest Surfer on the Beach"" did to the Croakies set.  </p>
<p>As with all of APTBS’ previous work,<i> Transfixiation</i> is full of noise, though it’s not necessarily <i>noisy</i>. The blistered, red-hot distortion and shrieking feedback are purposeful noise, the kind that’s typically a cloaking device within indie rock<span>—</span>either for a pure pop predilection, hurt feelings, or at worst, a disinclination for songcraft. In this case, the noise is a feint for an underlying ambition; even as Oliver Ackermann finds new ways to subject his guitars to circuitry S&amp;M, APTBS have increasingly given the impression that they want to be seen as more than ""the guy who makes guitar pedals.""</p>
<p>And so <i>Transfixiation</i> emphasizes its rhythm section, which in turn emphasizes that APTBS are a <i>band</i>. It’s not surprising that when given more a showcase, bassist Dion Lunadon relies on the steady menace of early Peter Hook or the high-fretted melodicism of later Peter Hook. That doesn’t mean it’s ineffective<span>—</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">""</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Straight"" is the most instantly memorable track if only because it recalls a jacked-up version of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’s ""Myxomatosis""</span> while ""Supermaster"" and ""We’ve Come So Far"" rely on pure velocity. APTBS don’t actually deal much in hooks, so the semblance of danceable rhythm is a proper substitute.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s not a huge shift from 2012’s relatively streamlined <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16750-worship/""><i>Worship</i></a>, which itself wasn’t a huge shift from its predecessor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13500-exploding-head/""><i>Exploding Head</i></a>. APTBS’ progress has been incremental over the years, so <i>Transfixiation</i> derives much of its success from being compared to their 2007 breakthrough<span>—</span> those who have been following since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10595-a-place-to-bury-strangers/""><i>A Place to Bury Strangers</i></a> can recognize the band’s evolution and justify their own investment. Those who are coming into <i>Transfixiation</i> blind might just hear a notable band boasting a currently rare commitment to an '80s kind of noise-rock rather than the '90s iterations of shoegaze, goth, or industrial that’s more prominent in 2015.</p>
<p>Then again, APTBS’ progress as a band only serves to expose the underlying one-dimensionality of their actual songwriting. This is a style of music rarely lauded for its lyrics in general, let alone its topical range—it’s probably too much to ask for a political A Place to Bury Strangers song or a tripartite prog epic, or a gooey love note just to shake things up. But for a band whose songs so frequently draw on the depths of despair, incapacitating depression, and occasional kink for inspiration, the grousing of <i>Transfixiation</i> feels perfunctory. However admirable ""Filling the Void"", ""I’m So Clean"" and ""Love High"" are for their sonic formalism, the songs themselves are like fortune cookies filled with quotes from latter day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6209-trent-reznor/"">Trent Reznor</a> or the <a href=""https://twitter.com/sosadtoday"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@sosadtoday</a> Twitter feed.</p>
<p>Case in point, ""Deeper""—a generous reading would frame it as a devastating parody. An accurate reading would frame it as the six-minute nadir of APTBS’ fourth album. The chorus goes, ""Deeper, deeper, deeper still/ Deeper than the deepest well,"" which isn’t the funniest part only because Ackermann adopts a Christian Bale-as-Batman baritone to taunt, ""if you fuck with me, you’re gonna burn"" right before it. Occasionally, <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">APTBS traffic in a speedfreak roadhouse blues that recall a mondo distorted version of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"" target=""_blank"">Suicide</a>; conversely, ""Deeper"" is the first song ever to be conceivably inspired by Rollins Band’s legendary high comic cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCjG95sNoP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost Rider""</a>. If <i>The Crow: 2037</i> ends up getting a release, ""Deeper"" would do well to soundtrack the rain-soaked resurrection of whoever that year's version of Edward Furlong happens to be.</p>
<p>But zone out from ""Deeper"" and, combined with its instrumental successor ""Lower Zone"", <i>Transfixiation</i> is capable sludge-goth ambience. Regardless of its issues, it never distracts from intimating the same old points: Ackermann makes expensive guitar pedals and the band plays with a ferocity that will make theirs the only show you’ll want to see for the next month<span>—</span>and due to its ear-splitting volume, maybe the <i>only</i> show you’ll physically be able to hear for a month. So whenever the temptation to lend a closer ear to <i>Transfixiation </i>arises, you should know better by now.</p></div>"|20096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20096-transfixiation/|5.5|Ian Cohen

<div class=""a3s"">
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>In the 1920s, a reactionary trend began to take hold in classical music. Composers began to imitate and quote styles from centuries past: particularly, the music of Baroque and Classical masters like Bach and Mozart. Simplicity and symmetry became the order of the day, instead of density and sharp dissonance (hallmarks of the prevailing avant-garde). ""Neoclassical"" is a fitting descriptor to use when comparing the bulk of Sir Richard Bishop’s solo recordings to the far-flung experiments of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3979-sun-city-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Sun City Girls</a>, his disbanded, performance art-inclined avant-rock trio. As the Girls did, Bishop mixes and matches pan-continental musical styles (from East Asian traditional music to gypsy jazz), but he does so less abrasively: with simple tools (a guitar or two) and little theatricality. As in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDez514_nFA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most compelling</a> neoclassical compositions, Bishop’s music is driven by clever stylistic juxtapositions and attractive melodicism.</p>
<p><i>Tangier Sessions,</i> Bishop’s latest album of solo guitar music, was recorded in just a week during a short visit to the Moroccan city. Like much of his output both alone and with the Girls, it’s largely improvised. Bishop circles around and tries out instantiations of a melodic phrase before committing to one, seemingly debating where to move in real time. A particularly clear example of this phenomenon is the speed-ramping ""International Zone"", which grows in rhythmic complexity and tempo as the guitarist hones in on a central, raga-like melodic pattern. </p>
<p>Stylistically, the album evokes Morocco as a hub of cultural exchange. Bishop often explores the Andalusian flamenco guitar style, infusing it with gestures from across the country’s other borders. In the seductive, cyclical crocheting of ""Mirage"", there’s traces of the Mali-centered ""desert blues,"" a style sometimes considered to have inspired the American blues, but which now, in contemporary practice, re-emulates it. Elsewhere, Bishop’s haunting melodies recall the sound of the <i>oud</i>, a popular lute-like instrument in North Africa, as well as in the Middle East and Greece.</p>
<p>This image of Moroccan culture as manifold and mysterious is a prevalent one in literature and film, usually contributing to an atmosphere of intrigue or seediness (see <i>Casablanca</i>, <i>Naked Lunch</i> or Jim Jarmusch’s recent <i>Only Lovers Left Alive</i>). Bishop playfully evokes some of the Hollywood Morocco on <i>Tangier Sessions</i>. There is the flamenco chugging of the appropriately titled ""Safe House"", which comes across like Bishop scoring a farcical chase scene in a spy film. The energetic piece not only breaks up the otherwise meditative album nicely, but seems to acknowledge the music’s inherent cultural tourism, or the way this part of the world has historically captured the Western imagination.</p>
<p>The Sun City Girls’ tendency toward exoticism is hard to avoid; indeed, when doing something like shrieking in faux-Far Eastern gibberish, they push it in their listeners’ faces. Does Bishop’s more polite collage-artistry, too, condescend to and totemize its source material? To some extent (so, often, does the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"">John Fahey</a>, Claude Debussy and <i>The Nutcracker</i>), but Bishop’s irreverence doesn’t overshadow the beauty and gentle, sometimes breathtaking intricacy of this music. He’s spent decades getting musical vocabularies from all over the world under his fingers, and even when his improvisations begin to meander, what he creates from his well of options is remarkable and wholly his own.</p>

It’s one of the rare comps–gospel or otherwise—that I find myself returning to time and time again, regardless of that long-passed deadline. That said, I’d be hard-pressed to instantly name any of the nineteen acts that comprise the set, be they Robert Vanderbilt &amp; the Foundation of Souls or the Fantastic Goldenaires of Rocky Mount, N.C. But when <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic</a> last month announced the reissue of California sextet the Supreme Jubilees’ 1981 album, </span><i>It’ll All Be Over</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, their unforgettable contribution to that set immediately sprung to mind.</span></p>
<p>Formed in Fresno, Calif. by two sets of siblings, the Supreme Jubilees consisted of four Sanders brothers and two Kingsby brothers, all cousins who attended the same church. Whether you’re a fan of the Everlys or the Isleys, the Blue Sky Boys in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a> in the 21st, the preternatural close harmonies of kin is one of the more sublime sounds on Earth, regardless of whether it's recording secular or profane music. And the Jubilees' ability to make their voices converge as one is sweet indeed.</p>
<p>The liner notes suggest it was a struggle getting the gospel group’s sound down in the studio. One half of the record was engineered by someone well-versed in country and western, but not inclined to give the group the kind of low-end their live shows dealt in. So half of the nine-track album has a lightness about it that apparently didn’t do the band justice—the group was forced to relocate elsewhere to finish the album. When they moved to another studio, tracks like ""Do You Believe"" and ""You Don’t Know"" have a heftier groove, the bass and hi-hats crisp.</p>
<p>There’s some talk in the notes that ""If God had a disco, the DJ would be playing the Supreme Jubilees,"" but we all know he'd just have Larry Levan spinning the Joubert Singers' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnAatmJlgpA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stand on the Word""</a>. Decent as the uptempo tunes are, in retrospect it’s the slower, more effervescent numbers that have a tactile magic about them. ""We’ll Understand"" is taken at a stately pace, the organ plaintive, the flanged guitar like the last tendrils of honey in a jar. ""Maybe you can find some consolation in this song,"" they sing right before the chorus. When the organ wheezes and aligns with those voices, there’s a tingling sense of elevation.</p>
<p>But back to the title track, which also appeared on <i>Good God!.</i> It’s as the glorious as the golden sunset that comprises the cover art, even if it is a stock photo that numerous bands deployed for their own privately-pressed albums. ""It’ll All Be Over"" arches over the setting sun, suggesting that the afterlife is as beauteous as the Pacific Ocean come sunset, yet as warm as a baptismal dip in the Caribbean. The song itself is manna, the keys suggesting soul as well as Sunday service, with a woodblock beat clocklike even as it signifies that moment forever outside of time. When the Jubilees’s vocals meld together on the chorus: ""It’ll all be over/ And we won’t have to cry no more."" it devastates, not from that admission of death, of burden being released, but because it signifies that sheer beauty of the beyond. It’s about as close to a convincing argument I’ve encountered that the afterlife just might be better than life itself.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p></div>"|20224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20224-itll-all-be-over/|7.4|Andy Beta

The band logo emblazoned in white all-caps, the grimly grayscale urban backdrop, the dark-haired subjects clad in leather jackets—Mourn’s reverence for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">the Ramones</a> couldn’t be more obvious if they wore their t-shirts in their press photos. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9546-mourn/"">Oh wait</a>.) But despite a shared affinity for 90-second tunes, Mourn are drawn to the Ramones more as a model of aesthetic purity than a sonic template to emulate; though all four members are still in their teens, their scabrous sound feels less like a hyperactive buzzsaw assault than a series of steely knife nicks on the arm. And while, like the bruddahs, Mourn’s songs can be simplistic to the point of absurdity, for them, rawness is as much an emotional quality as a musical one.  </p>
<p><i>Mourn</i> was reportedly recorded live off the floor in two days, a tactic that emphasizes both the band’s feral energy and the isolated, claustrophobic uneasiness that ties these 11 songs together. More so than the surface <i>Ramones</i> similarities, what’s ultimately most striking about that cover shot is the fact that vocalists Carla Pérez Fas and Jazz Rodríguez Bueno are seen in a protective embrace, suggesting that this band is less an innocent adolescent pastime than a necessary sanctuary from a cruel world. That said, Mourn aren’t so eager to fit in with the normals at school, pledging allegiance to artists who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6161-kurt-cobain/"">died before they were born</a> or who are old enough to be their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">mom</a>, if not their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">grandmother</a>; in the few interviews they’ve done so far, they’ve talked about having <a href=""http://subbacultcha.nl/2015-01-13/interview-mourn#.VNpKX0I8Rgs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their music mocked by classmates</a>, and <a href=""http://vimeo.com/111123358#t=563s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the dispiriting experience</a> of encountering a potential new soulmate in a Nirvana shirt, only to find out the person wearing it thought Nirvana was just the name of a clothing brand.</p>
<p>As such, <i>Mourn</i> is the sound of outcasts congregating in a basement on a Friday night and making a savage racket to forget about the fact they weren’t invited to the big house party that all the popular kids from school are attending. It’s loud, cathartic, and boiling over with disdain for those who’ve done them wrong; when they start naming names on ""Jack"" and ""Marshall"", you can practically picture Fas and Bueno hunched around a computer, subjecting those guys’ pictures to unflattering Photoshop makeovers. Their music is anti-social media: Mourn don’t so much write songs as status updates—""you think you’re awesome/ I say you’re boring/ you called me a baby/ I just say ‘fuck you!’""—that most people would be rushing to delete the morning after, but Mourn turn candor into sport, dropping truth bombs and reveling in the emotional fallout. (And as if the album proper didn’t serve up enough unfiltered honesty, this stateside issue of <i>Mourn</i> tacks on a bonus single… called ""Boys Are Cunts"".)</p>
<p>But for all their impulsive lyricism, Mourn are an impressively patient band, with a keen sense of dramatic dynamics and gritty groove (courtesy of Bueno’s 15-year-old sister Leia and drummer Antonio Postius Echeverría) that belies their primordial teenage garage-band beginnings. (In particular, the opening ""Your Brain Is Made of Candy"" is a masterstroke of sustained tension that builds from a stark, solitary strum into a raging, stomping beast that abruptly cuts out the second it hits its feverish peak, transforming that titular sentiment from coy come-on to brutal kiss-off.) And for a record that whips by in just 24 minutes, <i>Mourn</i> exhibits a refreshing breadth that makes it feel like a complete album rather than an overstuffed, undercooked EP—while punkish toss-off tracks like ""Misery Factory"" and ""You Don’t Know Me"" feel like remnants of a formative phase Mourn have already outgrown, the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh-5FI21s6M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jane Says""</a>-like sway of ""Marshall"" and the goth-psych eruption ""Silver Gold"" respectively assert the band’s accessible and experimental potential. More than a simple clash of teen-angst noise and old-soul poise, Mourn’s debut album is a reminder that a big impetus for the former is the frustration of wishing you were old enough to savor the latter.</p></div>"|20122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20122-mourn/|7.5|Stuart Berman

""Well, I’m going to swallow you,"" he replies before seemingly directing his voice back to whoever is listening in on their conversation.

<p>The dog mini-drama is just a little taste of what <i>Talent Night at the Ashram</i> could have been had it come to fruition in its original format. Sonny and the Sunsets' fifth album <a href=""http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2015/01/20/sonny-the-sunsets-the-aquarium-drunkard-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">was supposed to be a short film</a> but after shooting pieces with actors, Sonny Smith realized the project was clearly becoming an album and ditched the plan altogether to construct a record.</p>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>Towards the end of the 2000s, a time-portal to 1960’s garage rock must have opened, because out came <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"">White Fence</a>, and Sonny Smith. And while his early early contemporaries only got louder, Smith’s psych music has cooled to a still vintage-sounding, folk-tinged mellow, like a crunchier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"">Mac DeMarco</a>. Smith has always been less concerned with crafting the most fuzzed out rock jams and more with telling the best stories. Every song on the band’s latest, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18109-sonny-the-sunsets-antenna-to-the-afterworld/""><i>Antenna to the Afterworld</i></a>, was some sort of hyper-detailed space-age mythology, full of sword-swallowing girls and green blood-splattered martian murders. His sun-kissed record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16753-longtime-companion/""><i>Longtime Companion</i></a> had him at his best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> impression, crooning about his babe the divorcee and reminding everyone of their mortality, as if he were dispelling wisdom around an invisible campfire.</p>
</div>
<p>So it’s surprising that Sonny and the Sunsets' latest isn’t totally batshit weird. Perhaps its cinematic intentions left Smith toning down his fantastic visions because <i>Talent Night at the Ashram</i> is grounded in a very palatable reality, one that harkens back to the band’s first two albums. But that isn’t to say this record isn’t without its surrealist moments. In ""Cheap Extensions"", Smith follows a girl he spotted in a grocery store by trailing her strange, long hair. In ""The Secluded Estate"", he speaks of a bizarre house filled with all the women he’s ever known and how scary a house it really is. Smith seems to consistently approach the female sex with the curiosity of a wide-eyed 10-year-old, but in a way that is ultimately charming rather than grating.</p>
<p>The stories Smith chooses to tell on <i>Talent Night at the Ashram</i> are mini-character studies seeking to answer what it means to be a put-together human. Whether he’s dwelling on a very private girl’s life on ""Alice Leaves for the Mountains"" or the stressed eccentric Icelene on the folksy, Kurt Weisman-esque ""Icelene’s Loss"", Smith tries to figure out his own characters like puzzles. The seven minute-long ""Happy Carrot Health Food Store"" plays like a kooky Richard Scarry book, a laundry list in pointing out hippie passersby that could set Smith on the fast track to pulling a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3572-jonathan-richman/"">Jonathan Richman</a> in the children’s music industry. ""Shannon who outworks everyone but always messes shit up,"" he sings, ""Why is she so terrible with all the customers?""</p>
<p>There’s indirectness to Smith’s delivery on this record, his voice sleepy and layered on each song. He’s usually a voyeur in these songs, not the main character, grasping for signifiers of other people’s normality (long hair, loud voices, happy homes) as he tries to figure out his own. Whereas on Smith’s last record he was battling the aliens, on <i>Talent Night at the Ashram</i> it sounds like he’s just become one, slinking through grocery stores and peeking into houses trying to pin down what everyone’s deal is. ""I filled out the application to be a human being,"" Smith sings on the album’s opening song to a girl who might as well be the whole world. ""I hope my papers go through.""</p></div>"|20182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20182-sonny-the-sunsets-talent-night-at-the-ashram/|7.0|Hazel Cills

Well, sort of; when a then-teenaged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Pollard </a>dreamt up his very first band from his Dayton bedroom, the name Ricked Wicky shone down from the imaginary marquee. Through dozens of bands and hundreds of records, Pollard—whose inhuman output rarely leaves him holding much in his back pocket for very long—held onto Ricked Wicky. Why he'd resurrect it now—with Guided by Voices' second act retreating into the rearview—isn't hard to figure: though they managed six LPs in four years' time, you increasingly got the sense Pollard's famously overactive mind was starting to wander. So, after a few shaky years and far too many diminishing returns, Pollard's looking to cast off expectations, refocus his efforts, and get back to what got him here in the first place.<br/><br/>Ricked Wicky finds Pollard joined by a few familiars—right-hand man Todd Tobias and <i>Earthquake Glue</i>-era GBV drummer Kevin March—and one complete newcomer to the Pollard fold: Nick Mitchell, a Dayton guitarist who Pollard stresses is ""no relation"" to ex-GBV axeman Mitch. Nearly all of <i>I Sell the Circus</i>, Ricked Wicky's restorative 15-song debut, was laid down on analog tape at Dayton's Cyberteknics; the sound is clean, crisp, and most of all, consistent, a comparatively hi-fi spin through the beery arena rock, prog-addled balladry and post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a> jangle that Pollard's spent the last 15 years alchemizing into something all its own. <i>I Sell the Circus</i> isn't a particularly surprising record, but in Pollard's recent catalog, it's among the most satisfying: 15 would-be anthems and stumbling serenades, no muss, little fuss.<br/><br/><i>I Sell the Circus</i> bounds out of the gate with a five-song stretch to rival that on any Pollard record of the last half-decade: the sunny ""Well Suited"", the strutting ""Death Metal Kid"", the spry jangle of ""Guts"", the champagne-on-an-empty-stomach stumble of ""Cow Headed Moon"", and the slick, swaggering ""Piss Face"". Delicately accented—a dab of pump organ here, a sliver of slide guitar there—and blithely catchy, this five-song run is post-millenial Pollard at his finest: nimble, lively, just mercurial enough.<br/><br/>While it starts off strong, <i>Circus</i> does get a little paunchy around the midsection.""Uranus Flies"" isn't much more than shits and giggles, while ""Even Today and Tomorrow"" only differentiates itself from the dime-a-dozen proggy Pollard ballads that pepper Pollard's every release only through Nick Mitchell's stately steel-string runs. Pollard passes the mic to Mitchell (who, God bless him, sounds for all the world like Bob Pollard just before) for the egghead-baiting ""The Intellectual Types""; sure it's dumb, but it's just the right kind of dumb.<br/><br/>Pollard being Pollard, certain quirks are inevitable: throwaway lyrics, overstuffed tracks, underwritten hooks, flagging energies. But the overall impression one gets from <i>Circus</i> is that of engagement: Pollard clearly wants this thing to work, wants to find a few guys to play with who he doesn't feel held back by, and despite the occasional foible here and there, his dedication to Ricked Wicky's cause rings out throughout nearly all of <i>I Sell the Circus</i>. One regal instrumental (""Tomorrow""), another hall-of-mirrors ballad (""Rotten Backboards""), and several more-than-serviceable rockers later, and <i>Circus</i> goes out on a high—""A Real Stab"", a stirring slab of straightahead power-pop that seems to gather strength as it charges towards the finish line.<br/><br/>Pollard could've kept GBV going: if nothing else, the money's probably better. Or he could've peeled off a few picture-perfect pop songs for any number of washed-up rockers without an idea between them, collected a few fat royalty checks, and spent the rest of his days holding court at home in Dayton. And he could've just as easily retreated into weirdness, content in the knowledge that the loyal servants of the Fading Captain would continue to lap up just about anything he had to offer. Instead, we get Ricked Wicky: recognizably him, but with what—after a few rocky years—feels like a renewed sense of purpose. If <i>Circus</i> isn't a front-to-back triumph, it's got enough juice in it to forgive the occasional misfire. Whether Ricked Wicky proves an ongoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19310-boston-spaceships/"">Boston Spaceships</a>-style reboot or just another nifty diversion remains to be seen; we'll know more in June, when their second album's due. For now, though, he's done teenage Bob proud.</p></div>"|20208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20208-i-sell-the-circus/|6.9|Paul Thompson

It did not, however, set the tone for the rest of a year where the genre reclaimed and celebrated its most strident and abrasive qualities, as if to scour away every last dollop of guyliner.</span></p>
<p>Whereas You Blew It! have dutifully and enthusiastically embraced opportunity to become the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/377-jade-tree/"">revitalized Jade Tree</a>’s most notable signing to date, emo’s official 2014 Hall of Fame inductions (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/76-american-football/"">American Football</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2777-mineral/"">Mineral</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2172-jawbreaker/"">Jawbreaker</a>) all imploded on the verge of their respective breakthroughs.

You get the idea. But all this means is that You Blew It! know their strengths<span>—</span>they’re committed to making accessible, reverent crossover-emo and their new EP <i>Pioneer of Nothing</i> is their most committed, accessible and reverent work to date.</p>
<p>It’s also their warmest work yet, and none of this should be surprising. Despite the new label and its brevity, <i>Pioneer of Nothing</i> isn’t actually the quintessential ""transitional EP,"" but more of an arrival, since <i>Keep Doing What You’re Doing</i> was already a transitional album. ""Match &amp; Tinder"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16411-award-of-the-year-award/"">""Award of the Year Award""</a> began that record with an electrifying blue streak which effectively ended their adolescent period started on <a href=""http://topshelfrecords.bandcamp.com/album/grow-up-dude"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Grow Up, Dude</i></a>. Five minutes in, they’d already moved on to the record’s core, softie mixtape tentpoles like ""Strong Island"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16472-you-blew-it-house-address/"">""House Address""</a> and ""Better to Best"", which showcased Jones’ pliable lower register and the most luxurious and luminous guitars in modern emo. This is the only kind of You Blew It! that shows up on <i>Pioneer of Nothing</i>.</p>
<p>And they sound like peers of the late-'90s greats rather than students on the brilliant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17248-you-blew-it-lanai/"">""Lanai""</a>. It’s the kind of masterful accomplishment that can be obscured by the fact that their name is You Blew It!, the casual intricacy and harmonic beauty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19352-american-football-american-football""><i>American Football</i></a> and the instantly nostalgic, amber glow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3986-sunny-day-real-estate"">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>’s <i>How It Feels to Be Something On</i> adding textural counterpoint to a <i>Clarity</i>-worthy, gooey pop center. But there’s a bitter edge to the lyrics that carries over from <i>Keep Doing What You’re Doing</i> as Jones expresses another disappointment in a friend who hasn’t moved on<span>—""</span>Don’t be cold/ I couldn’t think of anything less cool/ Than your Saturdays talking trash."" ""Lanai"" is a love song to the music that moves him, but also Jones writing a love song to a more positive version of himself.</p>
<p>The ""whoa’s"" return on ""Bedside Manor"", a show-closing, slow-climb ballad that’s been concentrated into a three-minute anthem. ""Your Side"" follows as <i>Pioneer</i>'s most revelatory moment, albeit as the first time in a while that You Blew It!’s ambitions can exceed their reach. Jones has dispatched his bristled higher register and proven he can sing. But there’s a difference between carrying a tune and carrying a song, and he’s not quite up to it here; as a nearly a cappella lament about the emptiness of the bar scene, it’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/543-brand-new/"">Brand New</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LllchE03xRk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis""</a> that can’t quite <i>go there</i>, and deliver the necessary vocal, lyrical or musical catharsis.</p>
<p>In a way, the near-miss of ""Your Side"" works in the favor of <i>Pioneer of Nothing</i>; otherwise, it might be too promising in a literal sense, giving every to reason to assume You Blew It!’s next album will likely exactly sound like this. Which would raise the question of why they wouldn’t just save ""Lanai"" and ""Bedside Manor"" for a record that has excellent odds of being the properly worthy <i>Nothing Feels Good</i> follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3406-the-promise-ring"">the Promise Ring</a> never delivered to Jade Tree in light of <i>Very Emergency</i>’s cloying pop-rock and leaping to Anti- for their lush, heartbreaking and misunderstood swan song <i>Wood/Water</i>. Judging by the superlative extramusical qualities You Blew It! continue to demonstrate on <i>Pioneer of Nothing</i><span>—i</span>ndustriousness, transparency, a lack of hang-ups about the e-word<span>—</span>it stands to reason that they'll let us know their next step when the time comes and that it'll come soon.</p></div>"|20250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20250-pioneer-of-nothing-ep/|6.7|Ian Cohen

Amid this kind of experimentation, his tendency to manipulate the spaces his music inhabits has remained a given, and for all that the multi-instrumentalist has produced in the world of heavy music, his most profound contribution has been an innate sense of the balance between elegance and ugliness. While <i>The Deal</i> isn’t a reinvention of that formula, the debut from his latest project, Sumac, offers a new perspective, one that finds Turner at his most sonically aggressive in years.</p>
<p><i>The Deal</i> capitalizes on an energy of unease, building from moments of fractured disquiet into a tumult of guitar tones and the disjointed rhythmic patterns of drummer Nick Yacyshyn (of Baptists). It’s not unfamiliar territory for Turner: much of what provided Isis with its distinctive sound came from the same move from dissonant ambience into volatile culminations. But <i>The Deal</i> isn’t an exercise in self-involved nostalgia; where his other projects largely homed in on carefully constructed frameworks, Sumac takes its strengths from a powerful fragmentation.</p>
<p>Though listed as an ""auxiliary"" member, bassist Brian Cook provides a point of reference for the music’s hollowed-out qualities. Cook’s playing with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4785-russian-circles/"">Russian Circles</a>, in addition to his past work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4359-these-arms-are-snakes/"">These Arms Are Snakes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/435-botch/"">Botch</a>, has seen him at his most commanding when manipulating the lower end of the sound’s spectrum. That bone-rattling distinction for Cook works so well with the other two members here that it’s almost surprising Sumac is a new band and hasn’t been around for years.</p>
<p>The music here employs both hardcore and post-metal with careful, but unhinged abandon. The outstanding ""Hollow King"", for instance, is a 12-minute rendering of Turner’s former ornate proclivities turned into something unpredictable and ruptured. That bellicosity is <i>The Deal</i>’s underpinning, giving the album a common thread to ground its otherwise improvisational focus.</p>
<p>Venturing into free form is a bold move, especially given that with few exceptions, the other projects for the band's members are built around directed compositional frameworks. There are certainly moments where the music struggles under the weight of its own improvised technique. But by and large, the risk pays off, the approach offering a sound familiar enough to speak to the individual members’ strengths, and vulnerable enough to see those singular characteristics take on something darker and more ferocious.</p></div>"|20225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20225-the-deal/|7.4|Jonathan K.

The group’s formative years—namely, the period spanning from the early slew of EPs in the late aughts to their 2011 debut, <i>Shed</i>—painted a portrait of four working-class kids looking to start some skate-ready ruckus and slap some sense into the Warped Tour set. They proceeded to balance that might with melody on 2012’s excellent album <i>Floral Green</i>, and further refined the approach on 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18694-title-fight-spring-songs-ep/""><i>Spring Songs </i></a>EP. A decade in, the labels aren’t sticking like they used to. For every ""true pop punk"" acolyte who groups them with Man Overboard and the Wonder Years, there’s a '90s-inclined listener who considers them the new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2172-jawbreaker/"">Jawbreaker</a>, or a former hardcore fan curious to see what’s coming next. </p>
<p>When labels become irrelevant, then so do the expectations associated with them, and it is from this precipice that Title Fight leap into <i>Hyperview</i>, propelled forwards by disarming self-awareness and generous, <i>generous </i>use of the whammy bar. Title Fight have referred explicitly to the album<i> </i>as a work of ""guitar music,"" and the effects-driven fretwork is the record’s most distinguishing trait, especially given the absence of the double-time drumming and in-your-face bass parts that dominated the band’s preceding albums. The boards are again manned by Will Yip, the band’s longtime producer; making a significant departure for an aural engineer typically inclined towards robust, no-nonsense punk, he swathes the chiming guitars in warped, shoegaze-y tones and sticks them at the very front of the mix, optimizing their dissonant effects. The textures are tactile; the steeled, gnashing strumming that opens ""Chlorine"" feels sharp enough to slice, while the cavalcade of prickly, chiming chords that kicks off ""Trace Me Onto You"" rushes in from all sides, bristling against the ears like steel wool. </p>
<p>The relentless focus on guitar tone might be <i>too </i>strong, though: on songs like ""Mrahc"", and ""Rose of Sharon"", the bleached-out fretwork bleeds into the surrounding sonic space as to render Jamie Rhoden and Ned Russin’s vocals downright inaudible. It’s worth noting that in the case of the album’s delirious closer, ""New Vision"", the mistranslation actually adds to the experience. Rather, the seamless union of the singer's mumbles and the guitar’s moans constitutes a new language in itself, united in the gloaming. But without a strong vocal presence to bolster slow drifters like ""Dizzy"", the richness of the guitars steadily overwhelms until there’s nothing left.</p>
<p>That’s a shame, because from a narrative standpoint, <i>Hyperview</i>’s lyrical concerns prove compelling, if only because they’re so relatable. ""Trace Me Onto You"" approaches the rage-fueled rush of makeup sex as a desperate attempt to reconnect with some form of the ""we,"" thereby legitimizing the ""I,"" a false union whose collapse is chronicled on ""Liar’s Love"". ""Your Pain Is Mine Now"", by contrast, seeks resolution in the form of emotional warfare, all Gatling guns and wasted tears. “Burned alive"" and ""tangled in the dark"" at the same time, Rhoden renders the sadness of subject, singer and listener obsolete. His muffled whines of ""Cry/ Die/Boo-hoo"" are all but engulfed by the flange, a pretty little nihilistic touch.</p>
<p>Some of the hardcore faithful criticize <i>Hyperview </i> as a naked stab at an ""indie crossover""—a softer, watered-down version of Title Fight's melodic pop-punk peddled as transcendent, but hollow in character. To a large chunk of fans, the band's signing to <a href=""http://www.anti.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anti-</a> (the Epitaph sister label behind releases from decidedly non-punk acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1250-dr-dog/"">Dr. Dog</a> and Xavier Rudd) constitutes both a commercial cop-out and a slight against the kids who wanted to see one of the more promising pop-punk acts grow up into a moshpit machine rather than an underwater emo outfit. Title Fight may be young, muddy, and occasionally clunky with the wordplay, but they’re certainly not stupid: The proper assertion of one’s independence may very well lie in the subtle, steady subversion of genre rather than a grizzled scream or the crash of cymbals. As for the complicated equation balancing volume and dynamics with intent, it's safe to say that <i>Hyperview </i>packs just as much intensity as in past records, albeit with a cooler, softer flame; between ""Rose of Sharon"", ""Mrahc"", and ""New Vision"", even the most skeptical fan will be able to find a slow-burner that captures the thrill of any <i>Shed </i>song. Consistent, concise and stylistically compelling, <i>Hyperview</i> is a good set of tracks, and a worthy crossover attempt at that, provided you’re OK with consulting the lyrics booklet and willing to take a ride on the undertow.</p></div>"|20173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20173-hyperview/|7.6|Zoe Camp

They're more obvious performers, more obvious musicians, more obvious comedians—everything they do is more <i>obvious, </i>and while snobs have reamed them as nothing more than dumb fun, dumb fun is emphatically the point. ""It's all a joke,"" Pond's Nick Allbrook once <a href=""http://www.grimygoods.com/2014/10/23/interview-with-pond-the-enormity-of-outerspace-whiskey-and-jokes/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>, and you can infer from those who've turned their noses up that they're merely affronted by the fear that they're not in on it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That's by design. Pond are chaotic, if not anarchic, and what they hold sacred is unfathomable. They'll stick to an ostensibly cliché album title—something blabbed by Jay Watson as he was coming off hallucinogens—because they made an off-hand quip about it in an interview four years ago, but then can barely commit to a single premise for the length of a song. Though the temptation has often been to compare Pond to green-out acid-freak noise-makers of the late '60s and '70s, in 2015 they bear a stronger resemblance to the unpredictable and erratic antics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>. Take the eight minute outlying closer out of the equation and the average track time is a nose over four minutes, free of the drawn-out jamwanking which bogs down their alleged peers. And like many of Ariel's tracks, Pond often find a way of squishing three songs in and around one, barely allowing any chance for the mind to wander.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Although songwriting chores are split, much of what's compelling about Pond is drawn from impish savant Nick Allbrook, who has a rare knack for delivering hooks of abstract nonsense with vital conviction. In interviews he leaps over fissures between talking points and trusts you to make the connection, and on record that manifests as characters like Caroline and Laura who come and go without warning or cause, and declarations like ""By the light of the sun and the moon and sound/ Merry go round."" When they play it relatively straight on ""Sitting Up On Our Crane"", a sentimental memory of trespassing with friends, Allbrook trades his poetics for Jay Watson's nostalgic wist: ""All I wanna do is get drunk and listen to Dennis Wilson/ Cause he's the man."" Insert obligatory yeah-yeah-yeahs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Pond's previous albums changed shape with each release, the constant being a fondness for the traditional tools of rock, but <i>Man It Feels Like Space Again </i>leans heavier on synths and dance rhythms, a reflection of them becoming staples of summer festivals like St. Jerome's Laneway. They've mostly chucked the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Zeppelin</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"">Hendrix</a> riffs of earlier songs like ""Giant Tortoise"" and Justin Hawkins posturing, going softer on the glam goofiness and stonerisms and feeling less like parody as a result. They won't be chasing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30917-flume/"">Flume</a> on <a href=""http://www.futureclassic.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future Classic</a> any time soon (then again, who knows? They already share a label with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5730-cut-copy/"">Cut Copy</a>), but these tracks seem more likely to incite mass writhing than a sea of banging heads and waving lighters. Sure it's got sneering commenters limp-lobbing potshots like ""That drummer is too good for this band"" on live videos as Jay Watson sticks to a basic beat, but it's all in pursuit of that aforementioned ethos, quaint as it seems, of reaching people. If accessibility comes at the cost of satisfying the need for some to feel discerning, so be it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But there's still plenty recognizable here, the pedals and effects boards stacking up like the inside of a hoarders den. ""Holding Out for You"" is a stomping stadium rock ballad, acoustic singalong ""Medicine Hat"" remembers some of the stripped back tracks on <i>Beard, Wives, Denim, </i>and ""Outside Is the Right Side"" does a psych-funk strut over its refrain, straightforward enough to slip snugly into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32633-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard/"">King Gizzard</a>'s catalog (and we're about due for a new Gizz record; it's been nearly three months.) That the album's halves pivot on a track called ""Heroic Shart"" should tell you all you need to know about any accusations of maturing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Members of the band have winkingly referred to their records forming a conceptual rock star career trajectory: <i>Frond </i>was the auspicious breakthrough, <i>Beard, Wives, Denim </i>their return-to-roots, and <i>Hobo Rocket </i>the fattened bombast of music industry fossils. The analogy breaks down with <i>Man It Feels Like Space Again, </i>though. That a band in the mold they're imagining might put out an album this fun on their sixth go-round seems unimaginable. Even in their repeated defiance of having anything to prove, Pond still scramble with the passion and irreverence of underdogs. </p></div>"|20214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20214-man-it-feels-like-space-again/|7.6|Jake Cleland

The sound might be characterized as Interpol's cosmopolitan nerve gone beatifically slack, their gothic architecture flushed out with heavenly light.</span></p>
<p>On ""Stay Gold"" you can especially hear a lockstep Interpol guitar line, encased in a glowing ray. The touch of the guitar remains present even in Fraioli's most fountain-of-sparks treatments, an underlying clutch or muted tick. Some complex timbres are devised. On ""Pedal"", small slivers of guitar signal drop and bounce like marbles across the stereo channels. ""Atlantic Din"" has the same physical intricacy, but heavier—a ball bearing rattling in a drum. Wholeness is reinforced by elements recurring across different tracks, such as the portamento synths that keep rearing up sadly, far in the distance. But if the album has some structure, what it lacks is tension.</p>
<p>You wouldn't expect Kessler, known for sharp, metronomic playing, to be an inspired improviser, and he isn't, in any traditional sense—he's on his usual sleek rails, but in a ruminative, decompressed way. The post-production follows his linear lead; every track compactly blossoms, bursts and fades. Events start to feel sparse in the ongoing grand drift. There are stock recitations of digits, perfunctory field recordings of New York City. </p>
<p>Two-thirds through, around ""Weatherman Accountable"", we hit the limits of the palette, and the record abandons any pretense of being more than short, simple, processed guitar figures. It's not bad, but it is faintly generic, as the titles I've mentioned (another is called ""Autumn"") might attest. As sonic cathedrals go, this one feels slightly synthetic. It doesn't add much to similar work by Eno and Fripp, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Fennesz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1334-eluvium/"">Eluvium</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/730-rhys-chatham/"">Rhys Chatham</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1862-growing/"">Growing</a> and countless others who've processed electric guitars into songful, airy or prickling masses.

Last October, solo female artists held down the top five slots of the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks straight for the <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6288913/female-artists-chart-lorde-taylor-trainor-iggy-katy-nicki-charli-jessie-ariana-ora"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first time</a> in the chart’s 56-year history, setting into high gear an overarching media narrative along the lines of ""girls rule, boys drool."" It was a compelling angle, with more than enough evidence to support it: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"">Taylor Swift</a>’s <i>1989</i> almost singlehandedly kept the record industry afloat; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HDdjwpPM3Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bang Bang""</a> presented itself as a millennial ""Lady Marmalade""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a> reset the standard for album rollouts; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31708-ariana-grande/"">Ariana Grande</a>, Meghan Trainor, and Iggy Azalea sat comfortably atop the charts. And yet something felt off about the media’s flippant insistence that the ladiez had so neatly seized the zeitgeist, powered by the spirit of #girlpower and sips from their mugs of male tears. For one, it was a narrative spun by a predominantly white male media, and as such, often felt try-hard and devoid of nuance, a one-size-fits-all empowerment comprised of little more than a perfunctory ""you go girl.""</p>
<p>Upon closer consideration, the ""girl power 2.0"" narrative began to deflate. For one, its breed of feminism was uncomfortably second-wave: it’s not hard to notice that the women reaping the benefits of pop’s reinvigorated interest in the female perspective were overwhelmingly white, and often selectively mining from black culture while shirking its accompanying baggage. Desperate for a snappy, condensable headline under which to lump pop’s female success stories, its complexities were glossed over. Why does mainstream media champion <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/23/meghan-trainor-i-dont-consider-myself-a-feminist-all-about-that-bass"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this kind</a> of body positivity and hand-wring over <a href=""http://mommynoire.com/115128/dear-nicki-minaj-open-letter-father/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this kind</a>? Where had big butts allegedly gone from which they <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/mackenziekruvant/look-back-at-it#.hd3NYdQPd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""returned""</a> in 2014? And why does clickbait-era ""empowerment"" seem to rely on either pitting women against each other, or painting them in reductively broad strokes, as though artistic agency is dictated by some gender-ascribed hive-mind? To complicate things further, 2014’s bumper crop of ham-handed ""Feminism on fleek!"" trend pieces were offset by an incessant barrage of <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2601606/Take-lot-selfies-Then-MENTALLY-ILL-Two-thirds-patients-body-image-disorders-obsessively-photos-themselves.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">think pieces</a> detailing the death of culture via selfies, Instagram filters, and other habits of young women thinly cloaked in terms of ""millennials."" It’s a baffling, and revealing, juxtaposition: bulk-value Kirkland Signature ""empowerment"" alongside constant reminders that, to adult male media gatekeepers, teen girl culture has no redeeming artistic value.</p>
<p>Enter Fifth Harmony, the five-piece girl group comprised of Lauren Jauregui, Camila Cabello, Dinah Jane Hansen, Normani Kordei, and Ally Brooke Hernandez. On paper, they may not seem like the most obvious candidate for feminist pop heroes: the group was born on ""The X Factor"" in 2012, ostensibly as a female answer to One Direction’s breakaway success (both groups were masterminded by Simon Cowell and placed third in the televised competition), a creation story that comes with an implied soullessness to a cynical eye. But in fact, the group presents a more genuine and compelling face of millennial girl power than anything else currently on the radio, filling the last decade’s depressing void of viable girl groups. Fifth Harmony’s first official release, 2013’s <i>Better Together</i> EP, centered around lighters-in-the-air breakup banger <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qti2X20w_gA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miss Movin’ On""</a>, hinted at the group’s potential to inject democratic, world-conquering bubblegum pop with unmistakable soul and friendly charisma, giving each individual member’s specific vocal talents room to shine while working as a unified composite. But with their debut full-length, <i>Reflection</i>, the group proves they’re much deeper than reality-R&amp;B doubters pegged them for. It’s an album of fun, feminist pop that is simultaneously wise beyond its years (four of its five members are still in their teens) and refreshingly age-appropriate—and it effortlessly embodies the ideals grasped at by the girl power think piece wave, with a sharp, nuanced perspective that can only come from lived experience.</p>
<p><i>Reflection</i>’s title track is a celebration of self-love without the somberness and pedantry that often comes with the topic, purring flirty coos to their own mirror images and breezily refuting the idea that women dress up for male approval. ""We Know"", a slick interpolation of DeBarge’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORgooDTrjSA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Dream""</a> that serves as the album’s most impressive showcase of each member’s solo talents (Jauregui’s weightless pre-chorus is particularly stunning), resonates because of its dead-on portrayal of restrained revenge: the most effective comeuppance against a dude that dicked you over is to tell your girls how big of a douche he is. ""Suga Mama"", with co-writing credits from Meghan Trainor, subtly updates ""No Scrubs"" for the 2010s, depicting a frustrated girl supporting her deadbeat boyfriend with quick wit and casual realism. Lead single ""BO$$"" redefines ""bad bitch"" as a PG concept, aspiring to be like ""Michelle Obama, purse so heavy, getting Oprah dollars"" and renouncing men who take without giving (""I want a Kanye-ye, not a Ray J""); like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lPQZni7I18"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Independent Women, Pt. I""</a> 15 years prior, it’s a song girls will be lucky to grow up with, with the added benefit of being catchy enough for adults to enjoy too.</p>
<p>Loaded with transient cultural references—from the nae nae to <i>Mean Girls</i> to #nofilter—much of <i>Reflection</i> is likely to erode with time, and for the moment, Fifth Harmony seem more comfortable cobbling together a selection of existent trends (along with a healthy dose of mid-'90s/early-'00s R&amp;B homage) than setting the trends themselves. The album’s most recent single, ""Worth It"", is an exhaustive exquisite corpse of practically every radio hit of the last year and a half (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbtPXFlZlHg&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jason Derulo</a>’s horns, DJ Mustard’s trance-y synth stabs, trap-inspired 808s, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSC9cgvtkRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'90s throwback sample</a>, and a wholly unremarkable rap verse, this one from Kid Ink); ""Like Mariah"" does what is says on the tin, with a cute if expected <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfRNRymrv9k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Always Be My Baby""</a> sample, though thanks to the group’s unwavering self-assurance, the end result is charming. But where the abundance of buzzy slang terms and sung hashtags might come off as irredeemably corny in less capable (or less age-appropriate) hands, Fifth Harmony make these moments feel natural. This isn’t some jaded 20-something trying to get @DennysDiner more retweets, these are proud, honest snapshots of what makes girlhood fun in 2015. Album highlight ""Them Girls Be Like"" (co-written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/"">Tinashe</a>) is the perfect encapsulation of Fifth Harmony’s subtle subversion tactics. Belting out lyrics like ""Do you ever post your pics with no filter?,"" the girls reclaim the habits often used to paint young women as vapid and narcissistic and celebrate them for what they are: harmless, fun, and often empowering. <i>Reflection</i> is what girl power really sounds like in 2015: a group of young women of color raised under the guiding principles of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1067-destinys-child/"">Destiny’s Child</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29154-tlc/"">TLC</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8162-spice-girls/"">the Spice Girls</a>, and their moms, imparting that wisdom upon a new generation.</p></div>"|20253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20253-reflection/|7.2|Meaghan Garvey

Out of that course came the four tracks that comprise <i>S</i>, where Moss distances herself from the motif of heartbreak, a subject that anchored so much of her previous work, and instead reflects more on the existential changes around her. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Miles away from the acoustic ""anti-folk"" origins of her first album, 2009’s <i>First Love</i>, but a conceivable progression from <i>Virtue</i>, <i>S</i> is a study in patterns and effects. ""Swimming Pool"" rings in with eddies of shuddering guitar reverb that guide the slow, cognitive track through observations on the perceived perfection of someone else’s unreality (""The sunshine, your tan lines, your good times and your blue swimming pool""). It's is an exemplar of how Moss’ new experimentations can yield ideal results—tranquil and ruminative, yet also able to take a compelling turn with metronomic beats and baritone backing vocals by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"">Wild Beasts</a>' Tom Fleming. But after such as intensely evocative intro, the ensuing three tracks fail to leave nearly as much of an impression.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The anxiety-ridden ""Social Halo"" uses the same repetitive patterns as ""Swimming Pool"", but here they lack momentum, only kicking over some chimes and roughing up some guitars in its four-minute run. This all comes across as feasibly deliberate—Moss literally sings ""the opposite of volcano"" throughout the song—but still stale nevertheless. Closer ""Somerset (I Can’t Get Over)"" is the closest we get to a glimpse at the pre-nomadic Moss with her bookishness wit taking center stage as she pleas for an ex to ""please don’t get over me"" between listing famous authors. It’s devoid of the symbolism that became distracting on <i>Virtue</i>, leaving the EP on a nakedly saccharine note.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Moss’ electric inclinations lay out a promising foundation for a full-length album which is said to follow this EP and, as ever, her narratives do hit some philosophical nails on the head, especially when it comes to the hot topic of digital anxiety. She has indeed stepped outside with <i>S</i>, but perhaps not far out enough; as it stands, Moss’ journey isn’t done just yet, but the final stretches of her expedition are in sight.</p></div>"|20219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20219-s-ep/|6.1|Melody Lau

In his work as Six Organs of Admittance, he refuses to stay in one place for long, darting between folk, rock, psych, and noise from album to album and song to song. But </span><i>Hexadic</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is his first record that actually sounds unsettling. His guitar playing is desperate and cutting—a fiery, jagged rip that recalls Japanese air-piercers like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2044-keiji-haino/"">Keiji Haino</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3074-kk-null/"">KK Null</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">. On the more hectic tracks, Chasny and his band approach the aggressive howl of drowned-in-the-red acts like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3782-sightings/"">Sightings</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27097-harry-pussy/"">Harry Pussy</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">. But even when they swing slower and sparser, the music remains harrowing, more bent on disturbing than soothing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The constantly-disruptive feel of </span><i>Hexadic</i><span> makes it perhaps the most consistent Six Organs albums to date. There’s a real sense of aesthetic purpose here; though none of Chasny’s work has ever sounded non-commital, his dedication to one guitar approach creates thorough cohesion, gluing all nine tracks together under one communal vibe. That effect was likely enhanced by Chasny’s self-devised songwriting </span><a href=""http://www.sixorgans.com/hexadic/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>system</span></a><span>, one that even inspired him to create his own set of Six Organs playing cards. But this method seems more about creating a frame of mind than hewing to specific rules, as the resulting music sounds ready and willing to go anywhere.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That openness allows Chasny and his colleagues—including his </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/""><span>Comets on Fire</span></a><span> bandmate Noel Von Harmonson on drums—to play patiently and thoughtfully. Even when they’re smashing into a crescendo, it feels like a natural, well-worn state rather than a rushed attempt to force frenzy. In a way they come off like an athlete who’s so calm under pressure her heartbeat hardly varies whether she’s winning easily or taken down to the wire. So even though </span><i>Hexadic </i><span>bears an ominous, sometimes even disorienting tone, there’s a placidity to the proceedings that keeps the music more welcoming than confrontational. It reminds me of how </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/""><span>Neil Young</span></a><span>’s noisiest songs sway rather than crash, more reflective than assaultive, despite all the sonic debris.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In </span><i>Hexadic</i><span>’s best songs, the reflective and the assaultive are two sides of a coin. The heavy march of ""Hollow River"" is both turgid in Chasny’s dense distortion and spacious in its elongated beat. ""Guild"" creates a similar atmosphere before retreating subtly into dry, open spaces, while ""Future Verbs"" is almost all open spaces, like a spaghetti Western theme stretched into suspense-movie tension. Other tunes are more blunt, terrorizing attacks—take the pummeling grind of ""Sphere Path Code C"" or the aptly-titled ""Maximum Hexadic""—yet still somehow feel measured, perhaps just by association.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Whether those destructive sides of </span><i>Hexadic </i><span>will appeal to anyone not already initiated into the Six Organs circle is hard to guess. You could even imagine some fans of Chasny’s folkier side balking at the relentlessness of his dark-lensed vision here. But such concerns seem beside the point; if Chasny was worried about maintaining or growing an audience, he wouldn’t have made so many unpredictable choices and opposing moves while crafting one of the most unique discographies of the past 15 years. And besides, you might not have guessed </span><i>Hexadic </i><span>would sound like this, but you won’t be surprised that it sounds this good.</span></p></div>"|20074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20074-hexadic/|7.6|Marc Masters

Over his first four albums, the singer honed an image not just as the best dressed, best behaved guy in the room, but as the heir to the Rat Pack’s dapper legacy, embodying an ideal of class and sophistication that disappeared generations ago. A decade in, however, Ne-Yo’s class act routine doesn’t carry the novelty it once did, and his spotless image has never felt more at odds with the times. Today listeners don’t crave perfectionists; they prefer flawed idols. And so on his sixth album <i>Non-Fiction</i>, Ne-Yo dares to rumple his exquisitely pressed suit a bit and join his contemporaries at the strip club. He stops short of letting his freak flag fly, but for the first time he’s hinting that he may actually have a freak flag in his repertoire.<br/> <br/> Of course, being the cautious sort, he gives himself some cover. In interviews, Ne-Yo has said for inspiration that he reached out to fans on social media to share their experiences, so that he could write what he describes on the album intro as fictionalized versions of ""true stories about real people."" That disclaimer frees him to explore salacious subject matter he wouldn’t allow himself under the assumption of autobiography: kinks, empty sex, the wanton desires of average schlubs. On ""Story Time"", about a clumsy attempt to twist his lover’s arm into a threesome, he even makes a vaguely <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98qw86dsdz0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ralph Kramdenian</a> threat of physical violence when his partner suggests bringing another man into the fold. Though he swiftly clarifies he’s just joking—even Ne-Yo’s fictional creations would never seriously entertain such an idea—it’s the most objectionable line he’s ever written. Thankfully, it’s also an aberration. Rather than straining credibility by reinventing himself as a dangerous wild card, Ne-Yo brings in voices like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q/"">Schoolboy Q</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a> to impart some hardened masculinity for him.<br/> <br/> For all his character acting, on <i>Non-Fiction</i>’s most sharply written songs, Ne-Yo couldn’t be playing anybody but himself. ""She Said I’m Hood Tho"" finds the star drawn to a brassy nail salon worker who isn’t shy about telling him he’s fallen off. Despite the mutual attraction, the chasm between their social castes leaves both of them feeling insecure. Anxieties about his career standing also creep into ""Everybody Loves/The Def of You"", where he can’t shake a girl who’s less interested in him than his celebrity connections. ""Only time I hear from her is right around the BET awards, VMA, AMAs and Billboards,"" he laments. ""She be like, ‘If you going can I come with ya? And can you ask <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10706-trey-songz/"">Trey</a> if I can get a picture?’""<br/><br/> Though <i>Non-Fiction</i> only occasionally rises to the high songwriting standards of Ne-Yo’s seamless 2008 album <i>Year of the Gentleman</i>, it does correct some of the faults of his last record, 2012’s <i>R.E.D.</i>, where the R&amp;B songs and the Euro-dance songs played as if they’d been written for entirely separate projects. Save for ""Time of Our Lives"", a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10892-pitbull/"">Pitbull</a> party anthem that slots into <i>Non-Fiction</i> as conspicuously as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi01aali_ey"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Six Flags commercial</a>, this time Ne-Yo finds harmony between the two genres, including a particularly imaginative one on ""Coming With You"", a chic house throwback with shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>. Where <i>R.E.D.</i> often played like an identity crisis, on <i>Non-Fiction</i> Ne-Yo makes the variety work in his favor. Over the 19 tracks on the album’s deluxe edition, he tries on an array of styles and personas, but even during his biggest stretches he never sounds anything less than comfortable in his own skin.</p></div>"|20228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20228-non-fiction/|6.4|Evan Rytlewski

More broadly, they’re about ""girls""—specific ones that occupy young Dean Engle’s thoughts, couch and bedroom, but they're also present as a theoretical construct in his daydreams. ""Knicks"" and ""Sportscenter""? They’re kinda about girls. ""The Dogs"" is 28 seconds long, Engle’s recollection of a guy with two puppies on his lap driving off a back road. It still manages to be about a girl, because he wishes the proverbial ""you"" were there to see it. Engle spends <i>Quarterbacks </i>in a heightened state of romantic curiosity, waking up with the express intent of either falling in love or falling out of love; a day without either is considered a miserable failure and <i>staying </i>in love is compared to being unconscious. To paraphrase a <a href=""http://www.vincelombardi.com/quotes.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">legendary overseer of quarterbacks</a>, love isn’t everything to Engle. It’s the only thing.</p>
<p>Engle has found the perfect vehicle for this kind of subject matter, which is twee-punk in its purest form. Based on some of their songwriting values, Quarterbacks could be a hardcore band<span>—</span>they have the requisite velocity, the brevity, the structural minimalism. His most complicated songwriting tricks are doubling a guitar riff with his vocals and bringing a song to a dead halt midway through just to catch his breath. There isn’t enough time for a verse <i>and</i> a chorus, so Engle just stuffs as many words into a melody as it can hold, zips it backwards and lets it fly. </p>
<p>But as with nearly all bands in the indie world using a sports reference in their name, Quarterbacks call attention to their music’s total lack of aggro masculinity therein. The guitars are played without distortion, which is necessary for Engle’s classic, nasal lilt to be heard. The entirety of <i>Quarterbacks</i> is slightly less than 22 minutes, meaning the average song lasts about 69 seconds. Even in the context of twee defined by their <a href=""http://shop.krecs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">K Records</a> forebearers, Engle’s couplings are adolescent, relationships entirely based on watching TV, holding hands and kissing. Engel begs, ""I wanna be the last boy to love you,"" the choice of the word ""boy"" being very important, as the settings of swimming pools, awkward dances and car rides liken college as more or less an adult summer camp.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a cynical streak that prevents <i>Quarterbacks</i> from being a literal charm offensive. Engle acknowledges his own social failings without dwelling on them, but <i>Quarterbacks</i> also grapples with its right to even exist. ""Simple Songs"" is the most obvious meta moment, as Engle sings, ""I believe in pop music the way I wish I believe in God/ Completely, without question,"" his preferred E minor-C-G chord progression serving as a surrogate Hail Mary. Except he doesn’t really believe they’re a proper substitute, implicating that choosing pop over God isn’t just a poor choice for one’s spiritual health, but a terrible clich<span>é</span>.</p>
<p>And so then, love. On ""Center"", Engle muses, ""As I get older/ I recognize that love is mostly situational."" True, and Engle seems to find it in every situation. Some form of ""love"" is mentioned in nearly half of <i>Quarterbacks</i>’ songs; within the first minute, Engle shrugs, ""I’m in love as usual"" and seconds later, ""I’m not in luv with anyone/ What’s wrong with me?"" He seems to realize he’s talking about some <i>pop</i> version of love, one that either belongs in scare quotes or misspelled as ""luv"" to drive home its falsehood.</p>
<p>In spite of the formalism, individual tracks on <i>Quarterbacks</i> are a sharp jolt. Together, they blur to make the album more of a mood piece; you can picture a house show where Engle starts to play the chords to ""Usual"" and the rhythm section thinks it’s ""Stay in Luv"" or vice versa. And while Engle ensures even the slightest song is a completed thought, compared to his more ambitious and extroverted peers, you wonder if the charm of the form exceeds that of the content<span>—</span>in similarly cramped spaces, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos"">Frankie Cosmos</a> brings more clarity and whimsy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31933-modern-baseball"">Modern Baseball</a> more detail, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32348-joyce-manor/"">Joyce Manor</a> more intricate pop craftsmanship. Then again, <i>Quarterbacks</i> may just be the sound of modest ambition being met. In an interview <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/01/30/quarterbacks-gen-f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with Fader</a>, Engle admits, ""20 years ago, this band would have released a 7-inch and then disappeared,"" his point being that he'd be perfectly fine if that was the ceiling. Which is to say that <i>Quarterbacks</i> truly is a labor of love.</p></div>"|20147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20147-quarterbacks/|7.0|Ian Cohen

""It’s uncluttered, yet if it’s a good production, people can hear things that aren’t even there."" Sherwood should know. Situated in London in the late '70s when punk, reggae, industrial, Afrobeat, electro, and hip-hop began to entangle and crossbreed, Sherwood was often in the producer’s chair to help dub out the results. His credits range from punks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32253-new-age-steppers/"">New Age Steppers</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"">Lee ""Scratch"" Perry</a> and industrial hip-hop band <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/40228-Tackhead"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tackhead</a>. And his remixes—be it for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3135-sinead-oconnor/"">Sinéad O’Connor</a> or <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/11192-Skinny-Puppy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skinny Puppy</a>—accentuated both the sharp and corroded edges of the beats as well as the space in-between. The work he rendered in Brit-Jamaican mash-ups as Creation Rebel, Dub Syndicate, and African Head Charge on his <a href=""http://www.on-usound.com/Home?HS=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On-U Sound</a> label in the early 1980s remain the headiest amalgams of dub some three decades later.</p>
<p>Collaboration lies at the heart of Sherwood’s work, be it with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group/"">Pop Group</a>’s Mark Stewart or <i>The Voice of Thunder</i> by Prince Far I, so it makes sense that in the 21st century, he’s gravitated towards a new generation of producers who also favor the concuss of Jamaican bass, primarily dubstep producer Rob Ellis, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5922-pinch/"">Pinch</a>. Dub oozes from Ellis’ production portfolio and he, too, favors collaboration, be it with old drum and bass producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3306-photek/"">Photek</a> or the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8811-shackleton/"">Shackleton</a>. Ellis and Sherwood’s collaboration stems from a 2011 DJ night at London superclub Fabric and singles followed.</p>
<p>On their first full-length collaboration, <i>Late Night Endless</i>, the two draw on their formidable pedigree, yet at times the album feels cluttered with sound. A lumbering drum pattern underpins ""Shadowrun"", sounding like a jungle 12” pitched down, hinting at Pinch’s dubstep heritage while ""Music Killer Dub"" draws from Sherwood’s lengthy CV. The voices of Jamaican legends like the Congos and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry—with a sample of now-deceased reggae-punk icon <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5998-mikey-dread/"">Mikey Dread</a>—all intermingle on the springy track, squelches and gurgles spurting out every few bars. Daddy Freddy’s well-deep growl rumbles underneath ""Bucketman"" as the other sounds push into the red and back. ""Gimme Some More (Tight Like That)"" might have the most telltale dubstep wobble of the set, infused with menacing horror soundtrack synth chords and growling dancehall vocals sped into chipmunk territory.</p>
<p>On the back half of the album, the collaboration settles into a flat middle ground somewhere between Sherwood’s '80s dub-punk productions and Pinch’s 21st century tracks, namely the '90s genre known as downtempo. A female vocal sample talking about birdsong, another sampled voice asks ""Did you get lost on the trip?"" gets tossed with a little diddle on piano, all of it wedded to a soggy drum track that is uncharacteristically generic for the two. ""Precinct of Sound"" also sounds staid, a voice croaking ""sound"" as alarm-like sound effects swirl around, lasting barely two minutes. If the hand drums of ""Africa 138"" had a bit more space, and didn’t have to tussle with another disembodied vocal and guitar line, the beat might have stuck. The most classic dub-sounding track of the album, closer ""Run Them Away"" best blends the two producer’s formidable skills. Though coming as it does at album’s end, the otherwise lovely chorus—sung by Sherwood associates Bernard Fowler and Bim Sherman—sounds like an exit strategy.</p></div>"|20151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20151-late-night-endless/|6.8|Andy Beta

The Louisiana-born preacher's son, whose given name is John Sudduth, was only minutes away from performing a song with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a> at the 2013 Grammys when, he <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mikkyekko/posts/10153541639904908?reply_comment_id=10153541708239908&amp;total_comments=3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YExItbXgfRI&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> more than once, his virtually one-of-a-kind designer outfit tore apart in the rear. ""Stay"", which Ekko co-wrote with Justin Parker (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a>'s ""Video Games"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">Bat for Lashes</a>' ""Laura""), is a guitar-and-piano ballad that finds hardwon elegance in simple emotional truths, and it wound up going 4x platinum. But that self-deprecating image of a fluke mishap right when Ekko nears the spotlight—there's something to it.</p>
<p>Earlier, when Rihanna debuted <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/rihanna-stay-diamonds-unapologetic-saturday-night-live-snl/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stay"" on ""Saturday Night Live""</a>, Ekko declined the chance to join her, citing short notice. After the song's success, despite ""a lot of pressure to capitalize on that momentum,"" he chose to wait because, as he told <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6221974/mikky-ekko-time-debut-album-rihanna-stay"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Billboard</i></a> recently, ""I ultimately felt like the songs weren't there."" Ekko all too clearly understands what that patience could cost—his proper debut album is called <i>Time</i>, after all—and he has gone all out in the effort. The dozen tracks here were whittled down from 250 songs, he said in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YExItbXgfRI&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">radio session</a> last December; recording took place in various places from Stockholm to Hawaii, and the credits list some 20 outside producers. All that preparation has made for a somewhat eclectic set of hooky, largely inoffensive pop-R&amp;B—held together by an imploring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley/"">Jeff Buckley</a> head voice—that feels simultaneously over- and undercooked.</p>
<p>Though <i>Time</i> is never less than competent, its biggest problem is an unfortunate lack of personality. Songwriting by committee isn't inherently more or less valid than any other approach (for proof, see John Seabrook's 2012 article ""The Song Machine"" in <i><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/26/the-song-machine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The New Yorker</a></i>), but what in Rihanna's commanding voice might come across as plainspoken here too often translates as just plain. That's most obvious in the album's idiosyncrasies, which mainly turn out to be less idiosyncratic than a little bit random.</p>
<p>First, there's the recurring conceit of time, used to little effect. On Benny Blanco-StarGate co-production ""Watch Me Rise"", ""the journey's only just begun."" Over the Lumineers-gone-digital stomp of ""Smile"", helmed by ""Stay"" collaborator Elof Loelv, ""we've got nothing but time."" Amid the manipulated vocal whoops of ""Love You Crazy"" (Ryan Tedder), ""everybody's saying seize the day."" By ""U"" (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29273-blood-diamonds/"">Blood Diamonds</a>), Ekko has essentially added ""in bed"" to the idea of taking one's time. The track actually <i>titled</i> ""Time"" sounds a bit like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s ""The River"" on the scale of <i>Frozen</i>'s ""Let It Go"". Even ""Riot"" (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s Dave Sitek), which at first struck me as a weirdly apolitical protest song descended from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>'s ""Electioneering"", makes more sense if you think about it in terms of <i>Time</i>'s lengthy recording process (""The clock keeps ticking and I can't figure out why we're not freaking out"").</p>
<p>Another quirk, at the risk of taking this track by track, is the pairing of two songs in a row about doves. How many albums have two songs in a row about doves? Amid the woollier electronics of ""Mourning Doves"" (Loelv again), the birds work as part of a simile for being together.  On fun.-like piano-and-beats strummer ""Burning Doves"" (""We Are Young"" producer Jeff Bhasker), ""we"" are ""too young.""</p>
<p>While it's ""Stay"" that brought Ekko in front of a network TV audience, other listeners may have come across him via his collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>. Of the two <i>Time</i> tracks at least partly credited to the cloud-rap producer, the more recognizably his style is the bleary-eyed come-on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14513-pull-me-down/"" target=""_blank"">""Pull Me Down""</a>, which, with an original October 2012 release, would have been ready for Ekko's initial close-up. Alas. Since then, Ekko has also sung blandly uplifting EDM with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22173-david-guetta/"">David Guetta</a> (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lnPzsAuLy4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""One Voice""</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"">Chromeo</a>-like electro-funk with Chris Malinchak (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBtufTZr-g0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stranger""</a>). His fluttery, polished way of singing has been basically intact since 2009's <i>Strange Fruit</i> EP, as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-iNjAhB8BA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube session footage</a> shows. But Ekko's voice as an artist, what actually distinguishes him from his star producers' other charges, remains for him to establish.</p>
<p>Dating back to the Clams Casino connection, there have been tantalizing signs that Ekko's interests might go beyond the easily digestible yet ultimately less-than-satisfying fare collected on <i>Time</i>. He's an outspoken fan of experimental UK producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27655-jon-hopkins/"">Jon Hopkins</a>. Along with Hopkins, Ekko <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mikkyekko/posts/10153541639904908?reply_comment_id=10153541665209908&amp;total_comments=3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> recently he'd like to work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>. Recent Facebook posts show him clutching copies of the new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a> vinyl album and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7967-words-and-music-our-60-favorite-music-books/2/"" target=""_blank"">the KLF's <i>The Manual: How to Have a Number One the Easy Way</i></a>. However, Ekko released <i>Time</i> right when another soul-seeking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">singer</a> with a song asking you to stay with him was heading into the 2015 Grammys with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>- and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a>-tying six nominations.

Blazer pressed, shirt-collar open and eyes shut tight in concentration, Misty, whose birth name is Josh Tillman, sat at his grand piano, that great totem of solitude and opulence, wringing out lyrics so alienated you wondered how he made it out of his yurt, let alone to the spotlit world of late-night TV.</p>
<p>After a line about his own irrelevance (""By this afternoon I'll live in debt/ By tomorrow, be replaced by children""), Tillman turned away from the piano and took center stage. Magically, the piano played on without him. Strings swelled, lights glowed with multicolored gels, Tillman put one fist to his hip and pouted like a glam doll—it was all an act, and why should we have expected anything else? As the song plowed into its bridge—""They gave me a useless education/ And a subprime loan/ On a craftsman home!""—laughter filled the room. Canned, of course: How could anyone laugh at someone so miserable, and about such shallow, middle-class problems? The audience took a second to decide whether or not they should clap.</p>
<p>""Bored"" is one of 11 songs on <i>I Love You, Honeybear</i>, an album by turns passionate and disillusioned, tender and angry, so cynical it's repulsive and so openhearted it hurts. Misty is at root a folksinger: Someone who uses natural-sounding arrangements and first-person songwriting to give the audience the impression that he's revealing the depths of his soul, which in a fucked-up way, he is. Because he sings sweetly, you imagine him to be sensitive; because he plays the acoustic guitar, you imagine him to be closer to a naked, more old-fashioned way of life, one in which we might frolic in the grass unafraid. This is an artist whose origin story starts on top of a literal mountain, abetted by psilocybin mushrooms—the story of a seeker in earnest, the kind that sounds even more credible when told by someone who has a beard or used to be in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"">Fleet Foxes</a>. Tillman is both.</p>
<p>Not all the jokes on <i>Honeybear</i> are as funny as ""Bored in the USA"" and several don't even register as jokes. Tillman often seems to play a failed, bitter version of what you might expect him to be from his headshots—an Andy Kaufmanesque hustler whose seams don't just show, but are constantly in danger of splitting. What should be the sweet story of a one-night stand (""The Night Josh Tillman Came to Our Apartment"") turns into a vicious, nitpicky list of his conquest’s faults, while a bar night (""Nothing Good Ever Happens at the Goddamn Thirsty Crow"") becomes a tirade against a guy trying to hit on Tillman’s wife. ""Why the long face, jerkoff?"" he spits. ""Your chance has been taken/ Good one."" For someone fond of glockenspiels, Tillman says the word ""fuck"" a lot.</p>
<p>Tillman is a wordy writer. At times, the music on <i>Honeybear</i> almost acts as a palliative to his lyrics, blunting the edges and keeping the mood friendly enough to get you from one excoriating piece of satire to the next. Fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a> will find that songs from <i>Honeybear</i> sit comfortably in their Spotify ""Mountain Drive"" playlists; fans of stand-up comedy will find the album as thorough, sad and bitterly cathartic as any good hour-long special. For all his poetic undercurrents, Tillman is a showman that way: He knows how to get his message across in a form people can clap to.</p>
<p><i>Honeybear</i> is conflicted music that leaves me with conflicted feelings. Tillman is funny, but his humor is driven by meanness and self-loathing; he’s sweet, but he can’t manage to say anything nice without smothering it in jokes, like a dog compulsively trying to cover up its own shit. He opens the album by forecasting the apocalypse but most of the time comes off as the kind of mystic who gives up and embraces the debauchery, the patrician in some yoga sex ring, a bimbo Nero who fiddles while Los Angeles burns and occasionally gets sidetracked gloating about how hot his wife is. Yes, he gets high, but he never really leaves the dirty, dirty ground.</p>
<p>In the end, his sincerity is a sharper weapon than his humor. <i>Honeybear</i>’s last couple of songs in particular—""Holy Shit"" and ""I Went to the Store One Day""—arrive at the strange clarity people sometimes feel in the wake of drug trips, where life’s simplest lessons are suddenly presented to you, quiet and nude: Love people, stay open, be real. Admittedly there are an infinite number of barriers to these ideas, not least of which nobody seems to agree what the words ""love,"" ""open,"" and ""real"" actually mean, but my guess is that Tillman would acknowledge that failing isn’t as important as never trying at all.</p>
<p>Despite attempts to draw lines between himself and his persona, the story of <i>Honeybear</i> is at least in part a story of Tillman’s own recent marriage, which seems to have slowed his pace and made him reconsider questions of intimacy and closeness, the way marriage can do. The album ends with what were apparently his first words to his wife: ""Seen you around. What’s your name?""—a question asked without editorializing. A few lines earlier, he had us at the brink of their deaths. ""Insert here,"" he sings plaintively, ""a sentiment re: Our golden years.""

It was recorded after the dissolution of the prolific experimental musician's marriage, a breakup that sent him back to the Bay Area after several years in Germany. And it was meant for release on a different label—a plan that fell through, for reasons unclear and perhaps unimportant, given that <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/home/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mexican Summer</a> gave the record a good home, and, potentially, a larger audience than Cantu-Ledesma is used to with his own <a href=""http://rootstrata.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Root Strata</a> imprint. So it's striking how much cool remove characterizes Cantu-Ledesma's own description of the record. He writes of his interest in ""conveying memory in music without being sentimental,"" and of ""translating the fog of images, people, and places that I've experienced in the last two years into a body of work that could still be ambiguous and leave space for the listener to enter.""</p>
<p>The resulting album is plenty ambiguous—its outlines diffuse, its composition unstable. It was recorded on a spartan setup during a three-month residency at Marin County's Headlands Center for the Arts: just guitar, effects pedals, laptop, and multiple tape machines, all run through a PA system in a huge, barnlike studio on the former military base. It's not so much recorded to tape as smeared across it. Heavily distorted, its fidelity often mangled beyond the point of recognition, it suggests solids crumbling like chalk—or, conversely, mist on the verge of taking a physical form. It is a sound of transitory states, of in-betweenness, of becoming undone.</p>
<p>Fuzz is nothing new for Cantu-Ledesma, who is also a bandmate of Liz Harris (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>) in the duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31869-raum/"">Raum</a>; his 2010 album <i>Love Is a Stream</i> bore hallmarks of Fennesz and William Basinski, artists who make the most of decaying layers. But what's different here is the physicality of the work—the scope, the heft—paired with the way that, for the first time, he seems to be moving towards something like song structure, as with the slow-moving melody of ""Remembering"", or the blown-out new wave of ""At the End of Spring"" and ""Love After Love"". This isn't the first time that drum machines turn up in his music, but they're foregrounded here as never before. That very specific combination of elements—the ringing guitar tones and flat, dry, electronic thwacks—will inevitably suggest comparisons with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"">Durutti Column</a>; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd"">Harold Budd</a>'s <i>The Moon and the Melodies </i>is another reference point, though Cantu-Ledesma's waterlogged-tape timbres and power-sander effects give the album its own specific mood and feel. Those echoes aren't so much end points as seeds, and in the fertile soil of his convoluted signal chain, they blossom into some truly incredible shapes, like the kicked-amplifier complaints of ""Remains"" and the keening feedback of ""Mirror of Past &amp; Future"", which sounds like a blood-sugar crash translated to voltage.</p>
<p>It would be hard to call the album unsentimental. At times it feels as though Cantu-Ledesma is fighting his way through the fog, swinging wildly, exhausted but determined. Sampled hits from a LinnDrum drum machine land with fat, dull whacks, like fists against a punching bag that barely budges. And wherever melodies make themselves heard, they're steeped in yearning—and that's not to mention the deeply emotional character of titles like ""Love After Love"", ""Remembering"", and ""The Last Time I Saw Your Face"". But perhaps it's that tension between cool remove and fever dreams that makes it such a wild, engrossing listen. The album is dizzy with mixed signals and cognitive dissonance, its pellucid guitar tones muddied and muddled and generally beat to hell. If <i>13 Moons</i> were a sculpture, it would be an abalone shell crusted with battery acid; it would be a broken, bleeding heart ensconced in a burnt-out amplifier. Ultimately, it's hard to decide if this is the year's most fucked up ambient album, or its most bucolic noise record.</p></div>"|20073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20073-a-year-with-13-moons/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

Throughout their career, they’ve carried traces of SST in their genetic makeup, but their very good sophomore set <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19251-ex-cult-midnight-passenger/""><i>Midnight Passenger</i></a> proved they could transcend '80s quasi-hardcore, adding a sense of atmosphere and texture to their approach. After expanding their boundaries on their second album, new EP <i>Cigarette Machine</i> finds Ex-Cult mostly staying in the lane of their debut. Which is not entirely a bad thing. That record was replete with negative energy bursting from the speakers; it was fast and insistent, with a surplus of stinging guitars, half-barked vocals, and gunshot drums. And here, the barn-burning ferocity of the band has yet to be quelled.</p>
<p><i>Cigarette Machine</i> opener ""Clinical Study"" is indicative of this fact, a focused and extra-tight punk tune splitting through with a razor-sharp riff and wrapping up in barely two-and-a-half minutes. Tonally abrasive and freewheeling guitar work threatens to send ""Meda House Company"" completely off the rails, which makes it all the more exciting. But the first five songs having virtually the same tone and approach—quick-fire blasts of aggression with roaring, pedal-heavy guitars—which makes the first 15-plus minutes of the 20-minute release bleed together. The brazen, scraped-skin feel of <i>Midnight Passenger</i> was tempered by quieter, moodier, and more slow-burning set-pieces like ""Catholic Entries"" and the first minute of ""Sid Visions"", which succeeded at giving the album a more measured pace and a little variety.</p>
<p>Closer ""Your Mask"" ends up being the album’s saving grace, not only because it sounds least like the tracks. It’s every bit as menacing as the rest of Ex-Cult’s catalog, but the slightly slower tempo and steady forward charge highlight the band’s swagger, controlling the pace of their songs instead of making them a desperate foot race to the finish line. It's the one example of the band pushing themselves forward and trying something new, a formidable way to complete a good-but-not-entirely-essential EP that mostly blazes its fire trail down a familiar path. What Ex-Cult are capable of and what they do are still on different planes, the former shown only in fleeting glimpses.</p></div>"|20108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20108-cigarette-machine-ep/|6.6|Martin Douglas

Existing somewhere in the intersection points of an imagined venn diagram between dance-y beatmaking, ambient composition, and neon-tinted synth-driven film scores, he's cannily zeroed in on making music for similarly liminal headspaces. On his third full-length <i>Creatures</i>, both<i> </i>for better and worse, Castex doubles down on the in-betweenness of his compositions. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Part of the trickiness in pinning down Castex's newest LP stems from the seemingly disjointed stable of guests he enlisted to help in its construction. There's assists from the narcotized Montreal ambient act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29177-sea-oleena/"" target=""_blank"">Sea Oleena</a>, Francois Marry of the staid multinational indie pop crew Francois and the Atlas Mountain, avant-jazz trumpeter Toshinori Kondo, and Bryce Dessner of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a> (to whom Castex offered production help on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18030-the-national-trouble-will-find-me/"" target=""_blank""><i>Trouble Will Find Me</i></a>). It's a diverse cast of players that represents the whole spectrum of his varied interests, and it shows in the final product on <i>Creatures</i>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Occasionally, as on ""Sir Orfeo"", he's able to parlay the disorienting nature of this conceptual variety into emotionally complex investigations of the spaces between musical worlds. Building from reverberating keyboard plinks to distant, labyrinthine vocals from Sea Oleena, Castex eventually settles into a narcoleptic synth-pop track that plays like a more optimistic version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Attack</a>, but not before he offers up a couple of dystopian vocal drones and teeth-chattering kick drum drops. It's this sort of exercise that Castex performs when <i>Creatures </i>is at its best—to hold fast his otherworldly concoction of genre-defying beatwork, while allowing each guest to pull him a little further toward their own sphere and the spectral middle ground that he so loves to explore.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And yet despite the gleeful discontinuousness of these high points, <i>Creatures</i> has a major Achilles heel in the form of Castex' newfound penchant for dramatic instrumental swells and grabbing at swooning emotions that are ripped from the pages of more heavy-handed post-rock acts. After closing out ""Roads"", a brief interstitial featuring a man reading what seems to be a particularly brutal tour itinerary, the album's closing suite relies on a heightened emotion that detracts from Castex's intricate tinkering. Tracks like ""Roads"" work because they're content to sit and stew in their minimal melodic parts, to wholly explore the mishmash of genre ideas that he's playing with at any given moment. So when something like ""Calice Texas"" suddenly and unexpectedly roars into a skyward vocal part, it can feel unearned.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><i>Creatures </i>nevertheless remains engaging for how these largely collaborative constructions highlight the stunning omnivorousness that Castex has been able to imbue in his solo recordings. In jumping from ambient pieces to barbed synth arpeggios and then all the way back to a mechanistic clatter that evokes his earliest efforts, he's given himself the freedom to capably follow his every artistic impulse over the course of the record's 12 tracks. Egregiously melodramatic missteps aside, <i>Creatures</i> exists as a reminder that out there in the between of electronic music are swirling, delirious spaces that are yet to be explored.</p></div>"|20184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20184-creatures/|6.2|Colin Joyce

They frequently host inexpensive, all-ages in-store shows—during their early goings in Chicago, artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5176-times-new-viking/"">Times New Viking</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"">Vivian Girls</a>, and others would perform there before playing the Empty Bottle later on. With their <a href=""http://permarex.blogspot.com/p/permanent-records-label-releases.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">label</a>, they release music from the fringes—psychedelic, beefy, muddy, weird, loud—by bands with names like Rectal Hygienics and King Blood. Every Monday, they thoughtfully curate picks for their record store's weekly newsletter. They named cats after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5265-betty-davis/"">Betty Davis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8017-time-capsule/6/""><i>Zaireeka</i></a>. These are the sort of people you root for. They're two-thirds of the L.A.-based garage punk trio Endless Bummer.</p>
<p>Quality isn't ever a guarantee for a new band, but consider: These people are first-rate curators who have run a consistently great label for almost a decade. Lance is a former member of the overlooked Chicago band <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HeavyTimes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavy Times</a>. The third member is Greg T., a guitarist whose credits include work with the coldwave outfit <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/permanentrecords/merx-the-law"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MERX</a> (whose two albums were released by Permanent) and the skate punk heroes <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/THESPITS"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Spits</a>. And right as the band got started, they packaged themselves with some well-tread rock'n'roll traditions. All three adopted the surname ""Bummer"" (a la Ramone, Davila, Partridge) and a uniform (all black, sunglasses, scowls). In the <a href=""www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTKO39CG9Xw"">video</a> for their debut single ""Such a Drag"", they got doused with blood. These are the sorts of rock'n'roll tropes that border on gimmickry, but in this case, their ""we're the Bummers"" narrative helps keep the focus on their angry (and often violent) music. Endless Bummer aren't simply ""co-owners of a record store plus another guy who's been in some bands."" They're the angry voices repeating the words ""it's time to say goodbye"" and ""I don't like you.""</p>
<p>They recorded <i>Vol. 1</i> with their friend (and sometimes employee) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a> at his short-lived home studio ""the Sweat Lodge."" That guy's reputation practically guaranteed that the guitars on the record would sound awesome—his backyard set-up produced successful sessions for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19545-white-fence-for-the-recently-found-innocent/"">White Fence</a>, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/blankfrank13/wand-take-me-back-to-the-void"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wand</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16921-meatbodies-wahoo/"">Meatbodies</a>, after all. Within seconds, those few opening strums of ""Gray"" portent the entire album's tone: This is brazen, blown-out, fuzz-caked, and dour rock'n'roll.</p>
<p>The Endless Bummer approach becomes quickly apparent. They're not the band to deliver the unhinged, wild-eyed screams you get from rock'n'roll's magnetic icons. Liz's drumming is more skeletal than flashy; Lance and Greg's vocals hover in the middle space between ""scream"" and ""monotone."" (The vocals on ""Speed Queen"" lean a little Lemmy, actually.) But this is a band that puts a premium on the numbers game. The vocals become vicious and beefy when barked by two dudes in unison; the onslaught of power chords doesn't relent. Their attack is emboldened by their hooks, which make a few stylistic shifts over the album's 28 minutes. Regardless of whether they're tapping into surf, blues, or punk influences, it all comes out in the wash sounding like Endless Bummer. It's churning, trashy rock music.</p>
<p><i>Vol. 1</i>'s lyrics are arguably most instrumental in defining the band's sullen, furious tone. They've got three songs about the beach (""High Tide"", ""Rip Tide"", ""Nuclear Beach"") which are the inverse of Frankie &amp; Annette's white-bread beach blanket fantasies. These are the beaches of exploitation films—kids drinking out of paper bags, nude old guys shooting up in the shade, people getting swallowed by the riptide. Over the stilted minor chord churn of ""B Movie"", they blurt a concise, satisfying kiss-off: ""I don't need you, you don't need me/ That's the way it's always gonna be."" Their mentality seems most clear on ""Bad News"": ""I'll crash your car, trash your home, hang around when you're alone."" The people wearing all black are sending a clear message here: they've been hurt one too many times, and now it's time to destroy something and/or someone.</p></div>"|20172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20172-vol-1/|7.2|Evan Minsker

Enter </span><i>Sleeping Tapes</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, a remarkable recording made by the actor Jeff Bridges and the composer Keefus Ciancia, the creator of the music for ""</span>True Detective"" <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">and ""</span>Nashville""<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">. On its surface, </span><i>Sleeping Tapes</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is pitched as a sleep aid. On a </span><a href=""http://www.dreamingwithjeff.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> accompanying the project, Bridges writes, ""The world is filled with too many restless people in need of rest—that's why I filled my sleeping tapes with intriguing sounds, noises and other things to help you get a good night's rest.""</span></p>
<p>At first, the sleep-aid tag seems about right. The album begins with downy swirls of tone—Tibetan prayer bowls, maybe, or pitched-down whirly tubes—overlaid with Bridges' gravelly baritone, as he mutters absent-mindedly, and hypnotically, about the project. ""Sleeping tapes! Ha. I love that idea, and all that it implies, you know? Sleeping tapes."" It's all a little bit more <i>meta</i> than your average melatonin capsule, but it's not hard to see how Bridges' voice, steeped as it is in his whole affable/avuncular shtick, would make a profoundly relaxing naptime companion. And who knows, maybe those meta aspects could themselves lend to the attainment of more vivid dreams, sort of like the dream-within-a-dream hijinks of <i>The Science of Sleep</i>. In the background, shimmering drones and faraway pianos carry a whiff of the ""Haunted Ballroom"" fantasias of James Kirby's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"">Caretaker</a> project, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2398-klimek/"">Klimek</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4610-music-to-fall-asleep/""><i>Music to Fall Asleep</i></a>; elsewhere, the clatter of found sounds, paired with Bridges' muttering, bring to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a>' ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wrw-ojKZtE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Ocean Doesn't Want Me Today""</a>.</p>
<p>But <i>Sleeping Tapes</i> is so much more than it appears to be at first glance. (Among other things, it's a fundraiser for the <a href=""https://www.nokidhungry.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Kid Hungry</a> campaign, for which Bridges serves as a long-time spokesperson.) In fact, and perhaps not surprisingly, Bridges proves such a captivating presence that it's obvious that sleep is hardly the issue here. After a few tracks of figurative throat-clearing—and literal throat-clearing, which, of course, given the throat involved, sounds usually sumptuous—the album shifts into higher and higher surrealistic gears. There's a humming exercise, and then a segment recorded on a playground, with Bridges in full-on granddad mode; there are slowly tolling bells and THX-worthy strings. Before the 43-minute album is finished, we'll have taken an 11-minute walking tour of Temescal Canyon, ""going for a walk like two old friends on a Sunday,"" a bit that feels a little like Mr. Rogers updated for the legal-weed era. Along the way, Bridges spooks a stray dog, finds an abandoned office chair, and mistakes a crow for a hawk. ""It's majestic, though, isn't it?"" he says, eternally upbeat. ""Makes you wish you had feathers, huh? If you want, we could pretend to be crows.""</p>
<p>And things get stranger, too. In ""The Hen"", backwards jazz licks flicker as Bridges tells the story of a tenor player known for carrying around plastic eggs of Silly Putty in his pockets.""Ikea"" is a minute-long riff on a space cemetery, or ""spacemetery,"" that's as disorienting as any of the blackout scenes in <i>The Big Lebowski</i>. There's even a moment of comparative gravity, which, given the low-key gonzo vibes of the rest of the record, only makes it seem that much more unhinged. A poem called ""The Raven""—not Poe's—it features the sound of rain and vivid Foley thunderclaps, and it suggests an unexpected kinship between <i>Sleeping Tapes </i>and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformed_Man"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Transformed Man</i></a>, William Shatner's 1968 album of dramatic readings and spoken-word.</p>
<p>Shatner's album was so over-the-top that many listeners couldn't decide if the ""Star Trek"" icon was really being serious, or if it was all a tongue-in-cheek exercise in thespian excess. Bridges, in contrast, remains in character the whole way through—even if part of that character involves frequently breaking the fourth wall to address us, his listeners, whom he regards with obvious fondness. We learn that he needs to get up to use the bathroom once or twice in the night if he drinks water before bed, but that's OK, because jeez, look how beautiful the full moon is; we learn that he's unfailingly chipper as a morning person; we even learn that he likes the sound of the toilet bowl filling, which he shares at the album's close over a bubbling aquatic crescendo. ""The pitch rises, you know, as it gets to the top of the tank, you get that little gurgle at the end—"" he muses, trailing off. ""Anyway, what I was going to say, maybe we've reached the end of this album. And you're not asleep yet! Well, what the hell, fire the thing up again!"" Before he goes, he leaves us with his No Kid Hungry pitch, trailing off into the mumbled mantra, ""We're all in this together; we're all in this together."" His warm-hearted spirit—his evident joy at just being alive—is infectious. Way beyond sleep aids, you get the sense that Bridges would be a hell of a life coach. The Dude abides.</p></div>"|20245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20245-sleeping-tapes/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

In that time, it’s become one of the most well-known and oft-performed minimalist compositions, and the reasons for this seem clear enough: The piece’s heterophonic structure is harmonically unusual, but uniformly consonant, and the piece’s insistent rhythm and devotion to melody, however fragmentary, give it a sense of unstoppable motion. It is friendly music, and a lot of music that challenges compositional traditions is not.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The basic structure of <i>In C</i> is simple: Someone plays a simple, droning pulse on the note C, usually on a piano or marimba, and the other performers, whose number and instrumentation Riley did not specify, have 53 melodic phrases from which to choose. The musicians select the phrases they want to play and decide how long to play them. The effect is that the phrases overlap in unpredictable ways, creating shifts in harmony, evolving polyrhythms, tonal and timbral changes and the sense that nothing is constant, even though the same note repeats insistently under the whole performance at the exact same tempo.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">There are dozens of recordings, starting with Riley’s own from 1968. Some are kinetic and exciting, others never seem to come together, but the piece is so dramatically different from performance to performance that it never grows old. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"" target=""_blank"">Damon Albarn</a>’s Africa Express project, which over the years has fostered collaborations between a huge number of Western and West African musicians puts a decidedly unique spin on <i>In C</i>. With an ensemble of 17 musicians—including Albarn on melodica, <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, Bijou and Olugbenga on vocals, Jeff Wootton and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"" target=""_blank"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>’ Nick Zinner on guitar, Cheick Diallo on flute, Badou Mbaye, Alou Coulibaly and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2846-mouse-on-mars/"" target=""_blank"">Mouse on Mars</a>’ Andi Toma on percussion, Modibo Diawara and Defily Sako on kora, Guindo Sala on imzad, Kalifa Koné and Mémé Koné on balafon, Adama Koita on kamel n’goni, and André de Ridder on several instruments and conducting—they have an earthy collective sound, and their dynamic interplay is quite distinct from any other version of <i>In C</i> I’ve heard.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">For one thing, the non-tonal percussion included in the ensemble layers a dance vibe under the piece’s usual trance vibe. Diallo’s flute in particular is so dissimilar from every other sound on the recording that he stands out and shifts the emphasis briefly to melody, while the three voices lend it an ethereal quality. The mellow tone of the koras, kalimbas, and balafons, meanwhile, have a strange effect during the period cooldowns over the course of the piece; they lend it an odd, cool darkness that I usually don’t hear in <i>In C</i>. These passages lend it a suite-like feel where the piece most often is structured as a giant crescendo followed by a long diminuendo. The most bold decision here comes just past the halfway mark, though, when the ensemble goes nearly silent, including the pulse, leaving just guitars and koras playing the slowest melodic phrases in a strange kind of canon, and then we’re treated to a brief spoken word passage (not in English) before the larger ensemble dives back in with even more rhythmic insistence than before.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">This willingness to play with the form and shape of an iconic piece of music is one of the things that most fully sets this recording of <i>In C</i> apart from most others. It’s unexpected and enlivens the music just as much as the djembe that lends the evolving beat its weight. The overall form of the piece may be more premeditated than Riley originally intended, rather than the independently reached and unforeshadowed consensus of a large group of musicians, but this mostly serves to make it an engaging performance and worthy interpretation of a piece of music that’s so eternal it could literally be played eternally if someone was able to get musicians to keep showing up to play it. Africa Express keeps it to a bite-sized 41 minutes, and every one of them includes something to savor.</p></div>"|20145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20145-africa-express-africa-express-presents-terry-rileys-in-c-mali/|8.1|Joe Tangari

As reported, the incident seemed disturbing enough, but even more so because it actualized a decade-plus of Whitehead’s lyrical and musical malevolence.</p>
<p>Since the late ’90s, working under the name Wrest in one-man, aggression-and-obsession outlets Lurker of Challice and Leviathan, Whitehead had emerged as a pillar of black metal in the United States. He coupled severe misanthropy with idiosyncratic execution to create mesmerizing, barbed records that sounded like little else. Epitomized by song titles like ""The History of Rape"" and lines like ""I will ruin your life... I will fuck you in the sun,"" Whitehead made his name documenting evil ideas. But with 34 charges leveled against him, it seemed that he had moved beyond simply detailing darkness and into enacting it. And that’s the guy that <i>Decibel</i> decided to put on its March 2015 cover, his seven-month-old daughter Grail cradled in his arms and his new album, <i>Scar Sighted</i>, in promotional tow.</p>
<p>The cover prompted, of course, a rush to judgment: <i>Decibel</i> was accused of rape apologetics, trolling, and using the prurient allure of a convicted felon <a href=""http://store.decibelmagazine.com/collections/back-issues/products/march-2015-125"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to sell magazines and Orange Goblin flexi discs. </a>Another, more ridiculous subset accused <i>Decibel </i>of going soft by putting a kid on the cover, since innocence isn’t metal or whatever. But defenders of Whitehead and the magazine—<a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/01/22/fear-emptiness-decibel-makers-leviathan-comes-seed-leviathan/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">even <i>Decibel</i> managing editor Andrew Bonazelli</a>—clamored to point out that 30 charges against Whitehead had been dismissed and that he’d been cleared of all but one of the remaining accusations. In what essentially served as an embarrassing advertorial for the issue, Bonazelli told Metal Sucks that ""both [Whitehead] and <a href=""https://www.profoundlorerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Profound Lore</a> label head Chris Bruni hotly dispute [that conviction]."" So what? Are convicted felons generally in the business of ""hotly endorsing"" their verdicts?</p>
<p>But the real resonance of Whitehead and Grail as Madonna and Child is, in fact, a parable that does link up with heavy metal’s ethos. It’s the tale of the vanquished villain returning as the triumphant hero. Whether or not you ""hotly dispute"" Whitehead’s conviction or call his accuser a liar, as many of his peers have, the scenario turned his music into a morass. From its derisible name to its scattered mess of songs, <i>True Traitor, True Whore</i>—released eight months after Whitehead’s arrest and nine months before his conviction—represented a new nadir in his vast catalogue. ""Things were very tenuous,"" he confessed to <a href=""http://steelforbrains.com/post/97137227537/jef-whitehead"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steel for Brains in an interview</a> late last year, ""and I wasted a lot of time being as drunk as possible during that period.""</p>
<p>Since his conviction, though, he’s moved to Portland, launched a new label and tattoo business with musician and new girlfriend Stevie Floyd, and had Grail. The family has <a href=""http://instagram.com/steviefloydjefwhitehead"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">its own Instagram account</a> and a new band. <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2011/09/13/jef-whitehead-sort-of-speaks-about-his-assault-arrest"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Once infamously churlish with the media</a>, Whitehead has been candid and even optimistic in recent interviews. ""Inspiration and energy-wise,"" he again told Steel for Brains, ""I feel like I’ve returned to a personal space where I can attempt to form what I hear in my head."" At least for now, Whitehead seems to have salvaged his life—a heavy metal antagonist-turned-protagonist, beating back the bedlam of his existence to push toward something like redemption.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>Scar Sighted</i> holds up its end of that deal. As strange and surprising as anything Whitehead has ever made, these 10 songs bristle with an exploratory energy that has long been his best (if rather inconsistent) asset. Though Whitehead has built his reputation as a nominal black metal player, his music is more compelling when that serves as its aesthetic core and not its outward bound. <i>Scar Sighted</i> presses hard against that past. Using uproarious blitzes of black metal only as dynamic peaks or plateaus, Whitehead commandeers the rest of the 64-minute record to create a stylistic phantasmagoria. Death and doom, musique concrète and noise rock, harsh noise and industrial sounds collide, bending into each other to create lurid new shapes.</p>
<p>Every few minutes, <i>Scar Sighted </i>takes another turn, but the moves rarely feel like detours here. In a 10-second window, for instance, ""Dawn Vibration"" pivots from a pneumatic black metal roar to a death metal stepdown to a bridge that sounds like a dying man screaming over a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> demo tape. There’s momentum to the motion. Similarly, the beautiful title track marches toward low-tempo oblivion, ghoulish voices and creeping riffs haunting a funereal lurch. When Whitehead leaps suddenly into one of its most straightforward black metal spans, the move feels only like another part of Leviathan’s current whole, not the inchoate tangents emblematic of Whitehead’s recent letdowns.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important element of <i>Scar Sighted </i>is the sense that Whitehead is again controlling chaos, rather than letting it control him. He is and has been something of a studio improviser, using the space of a room and a recording to create unique documents. Paired with real-life instability, that process has caused alternately brilliant and disastrous results. That carries over to an extent with <i>Scar Sighted</i>, as parts of these tunes can sometimes feel formless or flatulent. But many of these tracks are thoughtfully layered, so that you’re always peering through the melee to pick out the sound on the other side. ""A Veil Is Lifted"" is a stomping, stentorian monster, where a cavalcade of drums battles an army of guitars. But the rhythm fights against rumbles of alien bass and noise. In the background, a fluorescent second guitar riff runs counter to the lead. As ""The Smoke of Their Torment"" rumbles ahead, Whitehead slashes back and forth with counter-riffs that arrive at extreme angles, not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31518-gorguts/"">Gorguts</a>’ most dense successes. The song exits through an instrumental comedown, where lumbering bass and discursive drums dance with Whitehead’s atonal guitar. Suddenly, you remember that the guy briefly shared a band with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"">Thurston Moore</a>.</p>
<p>Whitehead foregoes shock-value misogyny and tawdry invective here, but he hasn’t softened. Instead, <i>Scar Sighted </i>depends upon an apocalyptic worldview, where extra effort is futile and ruins are all that’s promised. At the start of ""Within Thrall"", a multi-tracked chorus of one sings about ""the death of the gloaming""; at the close of ""The Smoke of Their Torment"",<a href=""http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> an extended reading from </a><i><a href=""http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Revelation</a> </i>boasts of the wrath of god at the end of time. ""All our righteous arts are like filthy rags,"" Whitehead bellows during the bridge of ""Gardens of Coprolite"". The song, mind you, is named for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolite"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fossilized feces.</a></p>
<p>It’s easiest to think about Whitehead and the last five-to-15 years of his life in reductive terms: For some, he is a felon convicted of domestic abuse, and he may never be anything more. For others, he is a dark dude who was caught in a darker situation, and he’s worked to build a new life and to renew his band. But the truth, at least as suggested by <i>Scar Sighted</i>, is something much more complex. It’s not a record of penance, as it’s about as furious as Whitehead has ever been. But it’s not a record of provocation, either, where he’s calling names and making threats. It seems mostly like an imperfect but intriguing attempt to reorganize his life and reassert his craft, to not <i>right</i> his wrongs but to not repeat them, either.</p></div>"|20094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20094-scar-sighted/|7.4|Grayson Haver Currin

Ottawa's Zex must feel real alien in this regard, owing their vibe from punk's initial explosion in the late '70s and early '80s. <i>Fight for Yourself, </i>the band's full-length debut, was self-released last fall, but <a href=""http://www.magicbulletrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Magic Bullet</a> picked it up for release this year. It's a collection of classic punk where the youth and energy of the band members—guitarist and primary songwriter Jo Capitalicide, vocalist Gretchen Steel, bassist Gab Sex, and drummer Tasha G—belies unexpectedly experienced songwriting.</p>
<p><i>Fight</i> highlights a very important aspect of any punk's existence, or any angsty music fan's existence, really: You'll do almost anything to get away from your shitty hometown, but where you came from will always be a part of you. This is propelled by the album's two strongest songs, ""Wanderlust"" and ""Savage City"", both of which appeared as singles prior to the album's release. ""Wanderlust"" sounds convincing with its streetwise playing, but it's not just the band's performance that sets it apart. Capitalicide has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTBS06gA7to"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">expressed difficulty bringing punk and hardcore bands to Ottawa</a>, primarily because many groups see it as a blip between Toronto and Montreal. Getting out isn't just a desire, it's a necessity. Zex tour frequently, and are set to tour Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand soon—their ""Wanderlust"" is certified. ""Savage"" closes out the album, and it's a loving beating of their hometown. Steel, in her most spirited performance on <i>Fight</i>, sings about being stuck in a city that's hostile towards them, comparing her and her bandmates to ""lab rats"" stuck in some cruel experiment. With backup vocals from Capitalicide and Sex in the chorus, in an Oi style, Zex treat hell like a celebration at a neighborhood pub.</p>
<p>While heavily indebted to the forefathers of punk, Zex also remember that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">the Ramones</a> may have played loud, fast, and loose, there was still some bubblegum in them. Capitalicide is known in metal circles for his work with <a href=""http://irondogs.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iron Dogs</a>, and while that group's NWOBHM style is somewhat present in Zex, especially in the charging opening title track, he lets out his poppy side on <i>Fight</i>. It's somewhat of a return to his street punk roots in Germ Attak, though he's become a more capable songwriter here. ""Screaming at the Wall"" makes being voiceless sound like an exciting proposition, the dread in Steel's voice serving as a foil for Capitalicide's bouncy guitar work. ""XXX"" is a catchy jam that conjures wandering through the red-light districts of Times Squares' distant past, curiosity running rampant. Steel's confidence shines through, but not without a menacing playfullness. The only moment Zex's pop flair backfires is on ""On Our Own"", a sluggish song whose main crime is that it packs the least wallop out of the whole album. Capitalicide tries a little too hard to sound bubbly and comes out jagged. That it's just before a banger like ""Savage"" is all the more infuriating.</p>
<p>Zex wear their influences on the sleeves of their studded jackets, but show an upside to young people bowing down to retroism: Sometimes it's more exciting watching a band exert it all on stage and still have energy left for an all-night kegger than it is sitting through the peformance of a tired, flabby group whose fire was extinguished not long after whenever ""back in the day"" was.<i> Fight</i> isn't perfect, but Zex have a stronger grappling of presentation than their peers, or the many that came before them.</p></div>"|20187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20187-fight-for-yourself/|7.2|Andy O'Connor

Or, maybe, they’re a throwback to the last time ""rock band"" <i>meant </i>something. All four members are under 21 years old and they play bar-friendly rawk with the irreverence and impatience of kids who still have to get drunk in the parking lot, replacing the classic rock and blues with mannish-boy punk vigor. They’re from Lititz, Penn., a town whose closest metro area is Lancaster, but they evoke New York in 2002, which itself evoked New York during a non-specific time in the late-'70s; think ""Welcome to New York"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift"">Taylor Swift</a> swapped out for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7320-julian-casablancas"">Julian Casablancas</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7485-hamilton-leithauser"">Hamilton Leithauser</a> and Paul Banks, a fantastical guided tour of art-damaged, post-punk, Koch-era NYC minus the clear and present danger. They’re a ""the + plural noun"" band. For those who felt the ""New Rock Revolution"" was exactly what its name promised rather than a revival of old aesthetics, the Districts' <i>A Flourish and a Spoil</i> signifies a restoration of order. For everyone else who simply likes rock bands, it's actually kinda quaint.</p>
<p>They're hardly the only ones who fit this description, but the Districts have significant advantages over their contemporaries. For one thing, they leave something to the imagination. It’s rare for the Districts to hit a specific reference point; the chalkdust guitars and laggard tempo of ""Chlorine"" recall the magisterial mope of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen"">Walkmen</a>, but otherwise, <i>A Flourish and a Spoil</i> is the first half of the past decade in ""rock bands,"" wadded up and spitballed. Rollicking opener ""4th &amp; Roebling"" in particular establishes itself as the meeting point in a drunken Transatlantic exchange between the loose-lipped pub crawling of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2471-the-libertines/"">the Libertines</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys"">Arctic Monkeys</a> and their more tight-jeaned American counterparts. And unlike, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31957-drowners/"">Drowners</a> or Catfish and the Bottlemen, Rob Grote doesn’t revert to flippant, soft misogyny as the most effective way of conveying ""attitude.""</p>
<p>Rather, he’s someone just removed from high school and parental supervision, grappling with how to live with one’s self and with another person. Grote’s subject matter is mostly what one might expect from a band of teens in a small town, which is to say, drinking, girls and getting the fuck out of that town. Classicist imagery abounds: in ""4th &amp; Roebling"", he waits by a train station, wine is drank, used as metaphor and personified; ""Suburban Smell"" looks towards the high school gridiron as a spiritual void.</p>
<p>In these songs, the Districts’ youthful energy and belief manifests in effort<span>—</span>while the band trudges dutifully behind him, Grote furrows his brow and intently scratches out his thoughts with the intent of giving everyday occurrences some true gravitas. Unfortunately, his logorrhea muddles his perspective, as the transition from feelings to lyrics lessens the impact of his words rather than deepening their resonance. Clich<span>é</span>s are jumbled and reconstituted, and in turn sound both banal and strained<span>—""</span>We’d crack mothers’ backs just by walking the street,"" ""There are sixteen homes on every street/ They all of course lie in the neatest rows."" It’s a shame that Grote doesn’t trust the impact of observation; ""Bold"" is one of the few times he lets the situation speak for itself, noting, ""My brother’s not home/ He’s learning war in fatigues"" as a reflection on the triviality of his worries about the dishes and whether or not he’s capable of loving.</p>
<p>Or, the main issue with the Districts is that they just haven't found a way to channel their energy and ambition into memorable hooks. John Congleton produces and similar to his work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"">Cloud Nothings</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19075-cloud-nothings-here-and-nowhere-else""><i>Here and Nowhere Else</i></a>, he stays out of the way, capturing a raucous, live-room sound. But whereas Dylan Baldi uses velocity and distortion to counterbalance his facility with songcraft, plodding tempo, wavering melody, and gritted ambience is all the Districts have. The few bits of trickery show a band still unsure of itself in the studio<span>—</span>a wobbly flange effect on Grote’s vocals in ""Hounds"" and the puttering drum machines on ""Bold"" emphasize <i>A Flourish and a Spoil</i>'s time-stamped experience by touching on Dave Fridmann’s obtrusive production work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips"">the Flaming Lips</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3295-phantom-planet"">Phantom Planet</a>.</p>
<p>All of which makes ""Suburban Smell"" a purposeful outlier in a number of ways. It’s a brief acoustic number where Grote shows his age; he’s not the road dog or barfly in prior songs, but rather the kid getting stoned in his basement while the rest of his class goes to parties and football games, the sum of which he calls, ""the retard dance."" It’s easy to call out Grote for lack of sensitivity. But while ""Suburban Smell"" may stink of piss and vinegar platitude, it’s the rare time when you truly know where Grote’s coming from, where the Districts are a ""millennial"" band in age and disposition rather than ""millennial"" in simply sounding like they could’ve scored some MTV2 play at the turn of Y2K.</p></div>"|20142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20142-a-flourish-and-a-spoil/|5.6|Ian Cohen

Many of his features had low budgets but a lot of style. They were dark, dystopian, and violent (though seldom gory), with plots that glued together genre conventions drawn from westerns, '50s monster flicks, and exploitation cinema. His best movies—<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077651/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Halloween</i></a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Escape From New York</i></a>, and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074156/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Assault on Precinct 13</i></a>, to name a few—have transcended cult-classic status. For the type of people who read <i>Fangoria</i> magazine, these are all-time hall-of-famers and required midnight movie viewing for virtually anybody else.</p>
<p>In addition to writing and directing, Carpenter also composed the scores for a number of his films. Working primarily with synthesizers, he crafted minimalist music that perfectly matched the eerie vibe of his pictures. These scores have proven at least as influential as the films they accompanied. Over the years, they have been studied by countless electronic musicians, dance producers, and general weirdos, who continue to find inspiration in the director’s ability to marry mechanical orchestration and highly emotive melodies.</p>
<p>Released by <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a>, <i>Lost Themes</i> is Carpenter’s first standalone record. It is not a collection of cues, but a set of independent compositions that echo the sinister tones of the director’s film work. Each track is a sort of mini-score unto itself, shuffling a theme through a variety of moods and variations. To call <i>Lost Themes </i>a John Carpenter solo album is a bit misleading, though. <i></i>The record is a collaborative effort that was casually jammed into existence by the director, his son Cody (of the band Ludrium), and godson Daniel Davies. As a result, if you’re coming to <i>Lost Themes</i> looking for the vintage Carpenter sound, you will have to adjust your expectations a little. <b> </b></p>
<p>Horror and sci-fi films are where the techniques and sounds of 20th century avant-garde music—electronic composition, tape music, atonal harmonies—found practical use in the mainstream world. Dissonant sounds slot well into these kinds of stories because they effectively convey shock and alienation. And it doesn't hurt that they're easy to generate with minimal resources. All you really needed to start with was one long, sustained, eerie and suspense-generating minor chord.</p>
<p>Carpenter's scores blended experimental ideas with simple but solid melodies. Having limited skills as a musician, the director made innovative use of technology—mainly synthesizers and drum machines—to generate epic sounds on a thin budget. Most importantly, he allowed synthesizers to sound like synthesizers, rather than trying to pass them off as a budget orchestra. These warbly alien squiggles and pulsing bass tones imbued his melodies with a distinctively robotic touch.</p>
<p>Because these machines were time consuming to set up and program, the director had to adopt a spare style, which he often put to brilliant use. Some scores, like Carpenter's collaboration with composer Alan Howarth on<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085636/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> Halloween III</i></a>, were composed on synthesizers as the film was being played back live, which gave them a drifty and improvisatory feel. These instruments played a large role in Carpenter's aesthetic, but he never seemed wedded to vintage gear. As the times changed, so did his instrumentation, and by the '90s, Carpenter's scores had lost a bit of their grit and otherworldliness.</p>
<p><i>Lost Themes </i>was composed using the computer-based sequencing software Logic Pro, and it sounds quite different from his analog synth-driven works. The keyboards are brighter and more video-gamey. On some songs, this doesn’t matter so much. From its first piano tones, ""Vortex"" is immediately recognizable as Carpenter’s work. If the director has a defining go-to gesture, it’s the pulsing synthesized bass tone, the beating of a single repeating note that provides a foundation for plaintive chords and hazy keyboard leads. It provides the bedrock for the <i>Assault on Precinct 13 </i>theme and also the soundtrack to <i>Escape From New York</i>. Fittingly, it is the central ingredient on ""Vortex"", which opens <i>Lost Themes</i>.</p>
<p>Other times, though, the details seem more haphazard. In <i>Lost Themes</i>’ lesser moments—""Obsidian"" and ""Domain""—it sounds as if the pair are trying to evoke dread and awe using keyboard presets borrowed from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>-goes-Christmas holiday electro ensemble, Mannheim Steamroller.</p>
<p>The main thing that’s missing, though, is a movie. Carpenter’s classic scores were filled with silence and space out of necessity. Film cues needed to stay simple and retain a consistent mood so as not to overpower the on-screen imagery, which relieved a lot of the director’s music from the need for formal structure. Unshackled from that restraint, Carpenter and his collaborators have created a set of recordings that are very ornate and dense. They shift moods frequently, segueing between eerie drones and heavy rock. At times, the album is a bit reminiscent of the Italian prog rock band, Goblin, who also composed horror film scores. This doesn’t make it bad, but it does make it a very different kind of listen. And ultimately, it's a less distinctive one. The eerie and empty vibe-outs that made up Carpenter scores like <i>Halloween III </i>and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093777/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Prince of Darkness </i></a>left a lot of room for imagination. They imparted scant information—just heavy atmosphere and mood that oozed out of the speakers like, well, the fog from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080749/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Fog</i></a> and ultimately seeded creativity and invention that had little to do with the films they were made to accompany. <i>Lost Themes </i>is plenty dark and heavy but shorter on inspiration. </p></div>"|20091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20091-john-carpenter-lost-themes/|7.6|Aaron Leitko

Roberts’ initial reputation indeed stemmed from her reed-based backstory; an improviser in Chicago who co-founded the bracing trio Sticks and Stones, she eventually broadened her work through scrappy solo records and session musician work with the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a> and Burnt Sugar.</p>
<p>Her proper step toward the spotlight, though, arrived with the release of her last two albums, or the first parts of a planned 12-record series dubbed <i>COIN COIN</i>. Intended as her personal and political exploration of African-American history, the work would pivot between the country’s barbaric slave-trade roots, the sustained suffering of Reconstruction, the upheaval of the Civil Rights era, and the country’s current climate of racial turmoil. She’d broach all of these topics, sometimes within the same song. The idea seemed an audacious undertaking, an epic that would either put Roberts in rarified visionary company or find her struggling near anonymity as she worked toward <i>COIN COIN</i>’s conclusion sometime around the start of this century’s second-third—or maybe both.</p>
<p>The work began brilliantly, with Roberts leading jazz ensembles large and small through tempestuous, non-linear tales of hard truths. Slaves were bought and abused, sold and insulted; mothers rescued children; a great diaspora scattered kin across corners of a new country. Roberts served as both anchor and motor. Using a technique she calls ""panoramic sound quilting,"" she pushed both bands through intriguing hymns and choruses, tangents and outbursts, reading and screaming and singing as the music moved around her. But could she continue plundering the past with a sound that kowtowed to it for a full dozen records? Could the ""jazz musician"" take it that far?</p>
<p>It seems now that she never intended to. <i>river run thee</i>, the third installment, is a seamless solo improvisation for a panoply of electronics, a multitude of multi-tracked voices, and a small coterie of saxophones. Something of a one-woman opera, these 12 tracks plow through harsh noise passages and spring into sudden refrains, drift through halcyon field recordings and float through harrowing spoken-word passages.</p>
<p>As a whole, the album examines the ways in which seemingly innocent objects—the oceans and the boats that traveled them centuries ago—fostered so much suffering that continues even now. (It is worth noting that, for the past several months, Roberts has lived on a houseboat in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, <a href=""http://boatafloatbrooklyn.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing about her experiences</a> as if to reclaim that vestige of American infamy.) ""Oh, why do we try so hard? All is written in the cards. The price rolls by the seaside,"" Roberts sings in the intoxicating and traumatizing opener, her cracking alto seeking redemption in spite of itself. The music reflects that maritime perspective: Oscillating tones and static swells are severe enough to induce seasickness. Roberts’ kinetic saxophone—and, sometimes, her voice, too—must wade through an electronic din, as though the sounds were a secret signal sent underwater.</p>
<p>The process here is paramount. Working in the same Montreal studio she utilized for mixing the first two <i>COIN COIN</i> albums, Roberts kept adding layers to the same batch of tapes, responding in real-time to what she’d already recorded rather than using a computer to put tiny parts into a meticulous whole. She inserted fragments of American standards—the famous and infamous ""Star Spangled Banner"", the soporific lullaby ""All the Pretty Horses""—and field recordings captured on a trek early last year through several benighted and/or proud burgs of the South. That semi-live approach elevates <i>river run thee</i> past the point of collage; there’s a momentum here that recalls, for me, the gusto of a great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7929-aaron-dilloway/"">Aaron Dilloway</a> set and a situational attentiveness that mirrors the close care of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15828-pauline-oliveros/"">Pauline Oliveros</a>. A solo noise-and-vocal record about history and built with folkloric and found texts might seem like an invitation to the obscure. But in part because of how it was made, these 46 minutes are magnetic, inescapable. I find myself wanting to see like Roberts sees, to hear like she hears.</p>
<p>To that end, <i>river run thee </i>suggests that Roberts is her generation’s rejoinder to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>, another wide-screen thinker who combined her instrument, voice and tale with the sounds and stories of others to ask questions so large that easy answers might not be found. But where Anderson could feel cool and clinical, Roberts takes care to be urgent and intimate. Though this set is a solo construction, where only she speaks and sings and vamps with her saxophone and synthesizers, it is absolutely not an interior map or a diary given sudden voice. Roberts instead pulls across generations and geographies, so that <a href=""https://openlibrary.org/books/OL17941069M/Dhow_chasing_in_Zanzibar_waters_and_on_the_eastern_coast_of_Africa."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the confessions of a slave-trader</a> neighbor the convictions of Malcolm X and the sound of a lonely saxophone telling the news of the blues tangles with the screech of a subway car and a newborn baby crying. It’s hard not to think of Roberts driving through the South, collecting and observing the experiences of others. In crossing theirs with her own, her work becomes an overwhelming chorus instead of an isolated monologue. This suffering is not meant to exist in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Late into <i>river run thee</i>, during one of the album’s more placid moments, Roberts declares, ""I like to tell stories."" The admission might suggest an easy key to the world that Roberts is building with <i>COIN COIN</i>. But it seems too reductive, really, not unlike calling her a mere musician. She collects stories, analyzes them, and then transmogrifies them, aggregating bits of material until anecdotes become open-ended, elliptical histories. Roberts knows that any story, just like jazz, is only an initial approach to something much more broad and important. Three albums into <i>COIN COIN</i>, it’s now clear that Roberts isn’t just a storyteller, musician, ethnographer, historian, bandleader, arranger, improviser, or activist. She plays all of those roles, yes; collectively, they power one of the most provocative ongoing bodies of work by any American musician.</p></div>"|20025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20025-matana-roberts-coin-coin-chapter-three-river-run-thee/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

Consisting mostly of drones sourced from solo guitar, her albums rely on deceptively dynamic elements that shift almost imperceptibly, forcing you to engage with each guitar lead, each swooning bass drone. On <i>Fantastic Planet</i>,<i> </i>Lipstate's latest LP, this detail-oriented approach is foregrounded for the first time, allowing the pieces to breathe with a vibrancy that they hadn't been able to attain before. Even from the opening strains of the album's lead track, ""Into the Dunes"", all of the moving parts spring forth in total clarity. It's a striking moment, given how often over her last couple of records she's been reliant on a sort of swooping sonic muck as her main songwriting tool. Her pitch-warped melodies bubble and coalesce into a creeping latticework of booming bass, twitchy drones, and slurred guitar leads. Each part is given distinct and clear weight within the mix, making the moments when Lipstate unleashes something a little bigger that much more powerful.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lipstate moves from pointillist detail to hazy heaviness throughout <i>Fantastic Planet</i>, but that contrast is most striking when the sounds she wrings from her Fender Jaguar don't obviously scan as guitar lines. Even since her days playing with the Brooklyn noise-rock experimenters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3431-parts-labor/"" target=""_blank"">Parts &amp; Labor</a>, she's demonstrated an interest in conjuring atypical sounds from her instrument—early Noveller shows were even played with her guitar laid flat on a keyboard stand—but <i>Fantastic Planet </i>finds her pushing those boundaries more than ever.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On tracks like ""Rubicon"" and ""The Ascent"", among others, Lipstate contorts her guitar parts into shimmering bands of sound that recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s early synthesizer explorations as often as they do fellow spaced-out six-stringers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30193-delicate-steve/"">Delicate Steve</a>. Since every layer is easy to isolate, this becomes a particularly disorienting tactic; such instrumental confusion forces constant attention and searching through what are otherwise familiar-feeling ambient pieces. The more momentous passages, as on the middle section of ""Pulse Point"", start to feel a lot stranger when you can't quite pin the source of the sounds down.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This has its drawbacks. As Lipstate so thoroughly focuses her pieces on details and deception, she occasionally loses the forest for the trees. With such focus paid to each individual part, ""Sisters"" and ""Growing"" display a tendency to let her fascination with the moving gears trump the narrative movement that marks her best material. But fortunately, such moments are few and far between. Most of these compositions represent a newfound directness for Lipstate, a willingness to present her strange experiments without feeling the need to obfuscate with the labyrinthine compositional exercises or guitar effects she used in the past. Hiding behind all of that was <i>Fantastic Planet</i>, a world just as alien and unsettling as the one depicted in the 1973 film the title alludes to.</p></div>"|20191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20191-fantastic-planet/|7.0|Colin Joyce

That part’s crucial—the sleazy shout-alongs, the implied physicality of its focus on rhythm above all else, the moment when enough repetition elevates music about dancing and fucking from hedonistic to transcendental—but there’s more to the scrappy, prolific house label than the dirty stuff. Over more than a decade and almost 300 records, Dance Mania staked its claim as ghetto house’s Motown, holding its own as the brash, DIY counterpart to more internationally-established, crossover-primed Chicago peers like Traxx and DJ International. Sure, the stuff that hewed a bit closer to house’s disco roots got the European licensing deals, but Dance Mania’s deep, familial roster got the overcrowded projects of Chicago’s south and west sides, the ones Parris Mitchell immortalized on 1995’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P8nCeweu9w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghetto Shout Out""</a>, where guys like DJ Deeon and Jammin Gerald were DJing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>, gangsta rap, Ron Hardy, and their own bedroom recordings. The music was raw, explicit, often escapist, and made do with the resources available, and as such, its apparent simplicity was often deceptive. In as much as anything can be about shaking asses, Dance Mania made music about shaking asses. But as the buttcheek-thinkpiece industrial complex should suggest, for better or worse, it’s never really <i>just</i> about shaking asses.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18947-hardcore-traxx-dance-mania-records-1986-1997/""><i>Hardcore Traxx: Dance Mania Records 1986-1997</i></a>, released via <a href=""http://www.strut-records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strut</a>, marked the first official compilatory survey of the label, and it arrived on the heels of Parris Mitchell and owner Ray Barney’s 2013 announcement of Dance Mania’s re-launch. (It shuttered gracefully in 2001; the label’s commitment to musical risk-taking had always relied on the financial success of its primary role as a record distribution hub, a foundation that crumbled in the late '90s as the independent retailers it serviced began to disappear.) That compilation focused on the label’s most essential tracks, documenting straightforward but formative early work like Hercules’ 1986 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovd0JBUNuqc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""7 Ways""</a>, the label’s second-ever pressing, as it grew leaner, rawer, and lewder by way of flirtation with acid, hip-hop, and techno. These are records that never crossed over into the mainstream in any significant sense (beyond the errant Daft Punk <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNjhsPt_8Gw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shout-out</a>) but often sell for thousands of dollars on Discogs today, thanks to a recent surge in popularity among primarily European collectors. It’s a familiar paradox for Rust Belt dance music innovators looking to keep their legacy alive: if financial viability is at all a priority, artists risk a loss of crucial context as they invest in outside markets.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Contrary to the pulp extremism of its title, <i>Ghetto Madness</i>, Strut’s second Dance Mania tribute, homes in on subtler, deeper-digging gems in the label’s sprawling catalog. Where <i>Hardcore Traxx</i> gave special attention to ghetto house’s formative years, <i>Ghetto Madness</i> sticks primarily to Dance Mania’s mid-'90s heyday, by which point the label had found its niche and dug deep, its dogged prolificacy speeding up to match the steadily increasing BPMs. The tracks are brittle, matter-of-fact, mostly percussive, and often devoted to giddy mythologizing of the city’s myriad pleasures. But <i>Ghetto Madness</i> also makes a case for the deeply meditative nature of these tracks at their best, and proves the bawdy shout-outs that have become ghetto house’s calling card are hardly representative of the genre as a whole. Tracks like DJ Rush rarity ""The Reactor"" and DJ Deeon’s ""1112"" are entirely non-vocal, closer to straight-up techno than any of the label’s earlier jacking anthems or hip-house workouts. Compared to the hyper, in-your-face instructionals of some of Tyree Cooper’s late-'80s singles, soul-sampling album highlight ""Nuthin' Wrong"", originally released in 1995, feels strikingly restrained. There’s subtlety here. And along with horny entreaties for girls to shake their shit, there’s real community outreach, too: DJ Milton’s ""House-O-Matics"" celebrates the Chicago dance crew of the same name, effectively an after-school program as much as it was a performance team.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From a strictly commercial standpoint, Europe’s new generation of Dance Mania fanatics with disposable income would be reason enough for Strut’s second DM reissue in two years. But in the context of house music’s renewed relevance on the global pop charts, the commitment to Dance Mania homage takes on a special poignance. At a glance, house’s most visible torchbearers in 2015 are, for the most part, precocious, white British boys often not yet old enough to legally get into the American clubs they sell out. With the commercial success of festival-primed EDM acts and the increasing reliance on overseas touring for house’s pioneers, some have <a href=""http://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/the-return-of-chicago-house-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wondered</a> if house still matters in its hometown of Chicago. But doubting the movement’s persistent relevance in its hometown ignores a fundamental truth: House never left Chicago, it simply changed forms. Steadily evolving over its three decades of existence, house has appeared as disco re-routed through MIDI, motivational hip-house, warp-speed juke, and abstracted footwork. The legacy of Dance Mania’s insouciant, trail-blazing ghetto house is preserved in the city’s flourishing juke and footwork communities as much as it lives on through the label’s second life; <i>Ghetto Madness</i> is just a reminder.</p></div>"|20205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20205-dance-mania-ghetto-madness/|7.4|Meaghan Garvey

Last spring, he began releasing a collection of 110+ songs in a fashion that is as decadent as the contained music itself: through </span><a href=""http://www.losttribesound.com/shop/wrfseries#sthash.nvcl2IY8.dpbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an ongoing subscription service</a><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">. </span><i>Revisionist</i><span style=""line-height: 24px;""> is intended as the culmination of the series, and high rollers receive it on 140-gram vinyl inside a book of paintings. The ballads that make up the album are equal parts melancholic, Americana-flavored pop and percolating, post-minimalist chamber music. The action is staged in the kind of cathedral-sized space simulated on defining mid-'00s indie rock records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/636-beirut/"" target=""_blank"">Beirut</a>’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1204-gulag-orkestar/"" target=""_blank""><i>Gulag Orkestar</i></a><span style=""line-height: 24px;""> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9365-yellow-house/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yellow House</i></a><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">; indeed, Fritch’s album could have reasonably been made during this period.</span></p>
<p>Fritch’s chief musical preoccupation is dissonance—not in regards to notes and harmonies, but to quality of sound. Much as synth devotees painstakingly shape sine waves, Fritch shapes ""unruly"" acoustic source material with a bevy of effects before putting the sounds to work as building blocks. Churning figures for string orchestra, rolling piano chords, and pealing electric guitar leads provide warm centers to sonic landscapes strewn with junkyard-snare hits and amplified pedal noise. While piecing these together, Fritch seems to visualize structure horizontally rather than vertically, preferring to let layered lines loose to combine and complicate each other over time, rather than focus on carefully building individual moments in succession.</p>
<p>The main issue with <i>Revisionist </i>is that Fritch reins in his primordial ideas too much—namely, by integrating them into non-descript song structures. The songs on the album spend a lot of time seesawing between two or three chords, which are squeezed for all attendant drama as they would be in a post-rock coda. The songwriting feels underdone; a side note instead of a focal point. A few striking ideas emerge, such as the catchy vocal motif in the hazy, timpani-punctuated pastorale ""Unholy Frames"". Fritch’s periodic field-holler chorale harmonies (see the shoegaze-inflected, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5012-benoit-pioulard/"">Benoît Pioulard</a>-produced ""Winds"" and funereal waltz ""Imposters"") are attractive, but they are not always forceful enough to disguise the basic formlessness of the melodies they embellish.</p>
<p><i>Revisionist </i>doesn't feel like a grand summary of Fritch’s project; in fact, it’s less alluring than some of the earlier, more cacophonous offerings in the series (see last April’s <i><a href=""http://williamryanfritch.bandcamp.com/album/emptied-animal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emptied Animal</a></i>). On those tracks, his vocals function more as an equal part of the overall sheen, or aren’t there at all. ""Revising"", in the new album’s libretto, refers to trying to reimagine, or even lie to one’s self about the past. ""Remain[ing] weightless and refus[ing] to be ashamed,"" or just ""holding on"" and pushing onwards is presented as an alternative to this—a way to avoid getting bogged down in self-doubt. It’s an appropriate metaphor for Fritch’s own creative process: hustling from one bare point of inspiration to the next, without leaving time to reflect or regret. </p></div>"|20101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20101-revisionist/|6.4|Winston Cook-Wilson

As he put it on <i>Clear Moon</i>'s ""Through the Trees Pt. 2"": ""I go on describing this place, and the way it feels to live and die."" The line was a clear mission statement, and the ""go on"" in this formulation seems as important as the ""describing"". On <i>Sauna</i>’s title track, he says he writes ""to prove I don't exist/ To show that I am beyond this animal form and this lost mind."" Existence, for Elverum, is conditional, not to be trusted, something that might disappear the second you take it for granted. Mount Eerie releases feel like an act of philosophical tax-paying, Elverum’s way of reasserting that he still exists, at least for a moment or two longer.</p>
<p>Like <i>Clear Moon</i> and <i>Ocean Roar</i>, <i>Sauna</i> is a careful cataloging of a single mind state. In some ways, it is an unacknowledged part three of that two-part series: hushed and patient, a processional of wispy, anxious sounds paired with Elverum’s calm, soothing voice. The album opens with a monumental whoosh of an organ, accompanied by crackling fire and the hiss of water hitting hot coals. The setting is pretty obvious, given the record’s title, but Elverum makes it explicit immediately: ""I don’t think the world still exists/ Only this room in the snow, and the light from the coals."" The song rolls on for 10 minutes, a luxurious stretch of drone rock as thick and murky as the lyrics are clear: ""My life is a small fire I carry around,"" he sings, echoing, maybe, the ""carrying the fire"" line from Cormac McCarthy’s <i>The Road</i>.</p>
<p>Elverum has never been artful or coy about his music: If you listen to a few minutes of one of his records, he will probably spell out for you exactly what he is exploring on them, and he will probably even tell you how he intends to do it. There is an admirable transparency to him, a sense that he has nothing to hide and would like for you to venture into the mysteriousness of his records armed with exactly as much information as he has. His lyrics are riddled with everyday actions: ""I walked to the bookstore in the rain that silently filled the air/ All the lights were off or dim/ And there was nothing to do but walk to town and back,"" he sings on ""Pumpkin"".  There is something almost aggressively quotidian about the scenarios he paints, like an indie film that aims to test your patience for how little action constitutes a ""motion picture."" Coffee is poured, windows are gazed at pensively, tractors idle.</p>
<p>As always, that mystery resides in the sounds he manipulates. No one else sounds like Phil Elverum. The amount of mood, texture, and feeling he can communicate with a single guitar drone is uncanny. His sounds feel soft and pliable, like they've had a portion of their middle frequencies carefully ladled out, yielding only boom at the bottom and wisp at the top. The only frequency in between is Elverum, his conversational voice sailing out of the murk like a paper airplane hitting your bedroom window. The arrangement serves as a neat metaphor for Elverum’s relationship to the world: His voice, small as it may be, is the only thing he can be sure of. </p>
<p>Musically, <i>Sauna</i> represents a thawing, the point when the icy chill of black metal, which has gripped Elverum for years, passes. Instead of snow imagery, we get rivers, and the blotted, heavy guitars and humid organ act out the thaw the lyrics describe. Piano and violins share a plucked major-key figure on ""Books"", which speckle the surface of the song like little orange and red paint daubs blobbed onto grey. Folky 12-string guitars ring out on ""Pumpkin"", a song on which Elverum clambers over damp rocks to observe a split-open pumpkin sitting on a river bed. The pumpkin, bright and fat, feels like a fertility symbol, and his fascination with it in the song stands in for the album’s preoccupations. On ""Spring"", the 13-minute climax of the record, the mood darkens, as the organ blasts out hair-raising dissonances and the thaw turns into a deluge: ""Nothing is impermeable/ The basement’s flooded,"" he intones. Even in a season of rebirth and fertility, Elverum sees the possibility for oblivion.</p>
<p>Weather—specifically, crappy weather—has always been an inspiration for Elverum, something he discussed last July on the podcast Song Exploder. Deconstructing his beloved ""I Want Wind to Blow"", from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2756-the-microphones/"">the Microphones</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11352-the-glow-pt-2/""><i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i></a>, he called the weather ""a metaphor for my emotions. That was kind of what all of my songs were about then and, arguably, still are."" On <i>Sauna</i>, the weather has shifted, but Elverum’s mind state has not. ""As long as I am drawing breath, the world still exists/ But when I die, everything will vanish,"" he sings on ""Planets"".</p></div>"|20221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20221-mount-eerie-sauna/|8.1|Jayson Greene

But in the year and change since the group's last set, one of the musicians in the orbit of the amorphous crew has seen his profile raised substantially. On the strength of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17041-ilovemakonnen-club-goin-up-on-a-tuesday-ft-drake/"">Drake remix</a> and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19774-ilovemakonnen-ilovemakonnen-ep/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">well-received EP</a> of similarly blunted ballads, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"">iLoveMakonnen</a> was one of rap radio's strangest successes in 2014. But while he was working with the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a> and Sonny Digital, he also found time to lend vocals to four of the tracks on <i>Home</i>, Phantom Posse's latest full-length. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While the Makonnen connection is the most likely entry point to the record, his contributions are only a small part of what's going here. Each contributor brings something uniquely warped to the LP's seasick atmosphere, starting with </span>the first timid vocal on the album, courtesy of Renee Anderson of Melbourne, Australia's Private Life. Amidst swooning keyboard passes and the gleeful dips and dives of a nylon-stringed guitar, Anderson's breathy vocals suggest sighs, winks, and smirks. Throughout the record, there's a sense of humor and playfulness implicit in each syrupy saxophone part (on album opener ""Separate Ways"") or deadpanned vocalizations (often courtesy Makonnen or Littmann himself).</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> has employed the same sort of tongue-in-cheek approach to arrangements, but Littmann and company depart from the legions of Pink acolytes by rejecting post-millennial irony. Instead, Phantom Posse offer sincerity. There are chintzy horn lines, sure, but there's also endearingly bare reflections on dissolving relationships (""She Gets Lonely""), urban disaffection (""Come to Chicago""), and other simple woes. When Makonnen dedicates ""I'm Stranded"" to his dad, then lazily drawls that he doesn't feel like calling him anyway, it highlights the charming disconnect that lies at the heart of this record. At one moment distant and goofy and the next heartwarmingly bare, Phantom Posse spans the gamut of indie pop songwriting.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The emotional range of Phantom Posse is evident in the solo work of the constituent members (Littmann pens self-serious love songs under the jokey moniker <a href=""http://stevesobs.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Sobs</a> and Makonnen has been known to pair even his most heartfelt ballads with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8cAMor_eIg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andy Milonakis videos</a>), so they have practice balancing these impulses, and <i>Home </i>succeeds in crafting a delightfully dizzying headspace out of that divide. It can be tricky to handle serious subjects with a smile and Littmann's crew keeps getting better. It's only a surreal bonus that an internationally famous rapper had a hand in its construction.</span></p></div>"|20192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20192-home/|7.3|Colin Joyce

After years of releasing solid club singles on his own label <a href=""http://www.paletterecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Palette</a>, Tejada made the jump to <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a> in 2011. The collaboration spoke to his influence as a dependable underground producer and it led to the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15692-parabolas/""><i>Parabolas</i></a>, an album that revealed a deliberate shift in his aesthetic; instead of crunchy, textural techno, <i>Parabolas</i> was sweeping, fleshing out the lush harmonics and studied melodicism he’d hinted at in earlier work. Since then, he's settled into a comfortable spot in the ageless haven of the Kompakt roster, honing his skills in the realm of album-as-art form. His latest release for Kompakt, <i>Signs Under Test</i>, continues to explore the underlying principles of <i>Parabolas</i> and its follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17031-the-predicting-machine/""><i>The Predicting Machine</i></a>, and may be his most cohesive effort yet.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Signs Under Test</i> triggers a sweet ache rather than a foot-stomping energy blast. It’s full of bubbling synth noise, warbly acid stabs, and bell-like reverberations, to the point that it’s sometimes opaque. But on repeated listens, that murkiness comes to sound like carefully rendered songcraft, designed to reveal its precision on repeated listens. On ""Beacht"", a pealing melody undergoes a series of manipulations that are strung together so seamlessly, it’s easy to hear it as one long, looping phrase. Many of Tejada’s other compositions are rich in detail that makes their appeal hard to pinpoint: ""Endorphins"" winds up from harmonious acid squiggles to a suspended mechanical buzz that, left without its repetitive chord structure, renders the song momentarily weightless.</p>
<p>One of Tejada’s greatest strengths lies in a driving melodies that sounds anachronistic in relation to today’s dark, percussion-driven club techno and the frenzied glare of radio EDM. This puts him in a natural dialogue with mid-2000s Kompakt luminaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2890-michael-mayer/"">Michael Mayer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1472-thomas-fehlmann/"">Thomas Fehlmann</a>, and Axel Willner of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">the Field</a>. On ""Vaalbara"", one of the album’s emotional high points, a gorgeously wilted tune fragment elevates a dramatic cloud of piecemeal flourishes into a song that, halfway tuned to pop sensibilities and halfway to dank, fog-machine club atmospherics, rivals Nottingham’s rave revisionist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29381-lone/"">Lone</a> for pure melodic resourcefulness. While most of the dance world continues to view the creation of a solid album discography as strictly optional, <i>Signs Under Test</i> is a strong entry that proves Tejada's quietly building up a legacy of excellence.</p></div>"|20134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20134-signs-under-test/|7.4|Abby Garnett

So it’s fitting that, on their full-length debut, local dream-pop quintet Breakfast in Fur sound like a band mediating between bustle and bliss, their hearts pulsing to the beat of tense, Bowery-beaten locomotive rock, but their heads floating at the same disorienting altitudes orbited by Upstate eccentrics <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/"">Mercury Rev</a>. However, instead of sounding like the work of an indecisive, impulsive band torn between oppositional aesthetics, <i>Flyaway Garden</i> overlays the two and basks in the beauty of the blur.</p>
<p>Like a million indie rock bands before them, Breakfast in Fur began as a solo bedroom recording project, before braintrust Dan Wolfe recruited four friends to help him project his psychedelic vision on a widescreen scale. It was a transition captured on a <a href=""http://breakfastinfur.bandcamp.com/album/breakfast-in-fur-e-p"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">charmingly ramshackle self-titled 2011 EP</a>, whose tinker-toy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6330-elephant-6/"">Elephant 6</a>-schooled instrumentation spoke to the project’s humble intents, while the developing vocal interplay between Wolfe and Kaitlin Van Pelt emphasized the sturdy songwriting at the core. (This push-pull was perfectly crystallized in the titles of the EP’s first two songs—one called ""I Don’t Care"", the other ""High Hopes"".) However, with <i>Flyaway Garden</i>’s exhilarating opening salvo, ""Shape"",<i> </i>Breakfast in Fur instantly shirk the quirk and reassert themselves with outsized confidence and bravado, as if they were auditioning for a Dave Fridmann-judged episode of ""The Voice"". The helium-headed melodicism of old remains—""I’d like to sleep a thousand years,"" Wolfe offers by way of mission statement—but here it’s sent aloft on a charging rhythmic thrust and mounting textural orchestration that effectively flips Breakfast in Fur’s script from twee-as-fuck to fuck-as-twee.</p>
<p>Naturally, the easiest way for Wolfe to present Breakfast in Fur as a proper band is to play a mostly silent partner in his own enterprise. In contrast to his pervasive presence on the EP, he takes the lead on just two of <i>Flyaway Garden</i>’s songs while dueting on another, making Van Pelt the de facto lead singer, even if her increasingly Bilinda Butcher-like voice is submerged more deeply in the mix, and applied to wordless harmonies as much as sung lyrics. But unlike so many <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> acolytes, Breakfast in Fur whip up a wondrous, otherworldly sound without relying on effects-pedalled guitarchitecture, embellishing their acoustic folk-song foundations with ambient synth swirls, chimes, programmed beats, overlapping melodies, or, in the case of ""Lifter"", flute-powered jams straight out of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> '71 playbook. Theirs is a form of dream pop that recognizes dreams don’t necessarily come to us in a soft-focus haze, as they’re so often rendered; when you’re in the thick of one, dreams are disarmingly vivid, high-def experiences that can shift abruptly from ecstatic to ominous. It’s a sensation best conjured by <i>Flyaway Garden</i>’s cover of ""Cripple Creek Ferry"", which revamps <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzB29hqvj2s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the frivolously folky Neil Young standard</a> into a phantasmagoric tropical fantasia that feels like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tbm4Au3dZ0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">riding through It’s a Small World at Disney World</a> after downing a bowl of ayahuasca.</p>
<p><i>Flyaway Garden</i> makes an airtight case for Breakfast in Fur’s atmospheric allure and mastery of mood, though, with the album clocking in at a tidy 36 minutes, it’s more a collection of beautifully sculpted building blocks than a holistic grand design. A handful of the tracks—like the whirring rave-up ""Aurora Falls"", the <i>Pure Phase</i>-d ""Whisper"", and the dewy-eyed ""Sun Catcher""—feel less like standalone songs than carefully plotted ascents to as-yet unconquered peaks; by contrast, the yearning melancholy of ""Episode"" shows what an affecting singer Van Pelt can be when she’s entrusted with a song that allows her to do more than just coo pretty chorales, while Wolfe’s wiry standout ""Setting Stone"" presents a snapshot of what this band is capable of when it matches its lofty sonic ambitions with nervy intensity. The name Breakfast in Fur can denote both the obscene luxury of 1 percenters who can afford to get a little hollandaise on their mink stole, or the primitive, survivalist instincts of off-the-grid cave dwellers; the wonderful thing about <i>Flyaway Garden</i>’s agrarian psychedelia is that it makes both parties feel at home.</p></div>"|20144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20144-flyaway-garden/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Click through his <a href=""http://jibkidder.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>, and you see that Schuster-Craig approaches music as cosmophage, chewing up his influences—Atlanta rap, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a>, AM radio—into raw material for a blank canvas dripping with the excess of these ideas. His new album, </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Teaspoon to the Ocean</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, is his debut for Domino imprint <a href=""http://www.weirdworldrecordco.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weird World</a>, and represents a formal attempt to surface from the deep web into a small corner of the music world.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Teaspoon</i><span> is an album in perpetual slide, an egg cracked on the pan and swished around. What I remembered most was the pulsing bass line on ""World of Machines"", which is bathed in pops and clicks like a field recording from the unconscious. On songs with some percussive momentum, like ""Remove a Tooth"" and ""Dozens"", there’s a wobbly element to his guitar tone that emulates the precarious feeling of riding a boat on shaky waters without trying to tip over. He sings like one of those text-to-speech processors, his cadence all cracked and warbled. The songs and ideas within lap over one another like the waves Schuster-Craig sings about on ""The Waves"", which is interrupted midway through by a saxophone solo that leaps out like the Kool-Aid Man bursting through a wall.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""I love all adhesives: the tidy boogers of rubber cement, the matte haze of Elmer's, the puffy fungus of Gorilla Glue,"" <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/22813/1/jib-kidder-would-like-to-introduce-himself"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told Dazed</a> when asked about the importance of collage to his music. His songs are preoccupied with hazy, uncertain sentiments represented by phrases that sound like they’ve been assembled through one of those magnetic poetry kits you slap on your refrigerator. Aside from a handful of vocal spots from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a> and contributions on electric piano from Zach Phillips, <i>Teaspoon to the Ocean</i> is a self-produced album—Schuster-Craig does it all on every track. The brightest moments sell him as an auteur with something to say; the worst make it sound like he's just dicking around.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-20f98596-4bbe-bf61-dc6c-38c397f26e18""><span>The result is a little absent-minded, with the difference split between gleeful assertion and wanton noodling, the type of album that might sound best when you’re thinking about something else.

His 36th studio album, <i>Shadows in the Night</i>, is a collection of old jazz crooner standards most closely associated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5095-frank-sinatra/"">Frank Sinatra</a>. It’s an idea seemingly as weird as his phlegmy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13615-christmas-in-the-heart/"">Christmas album</a> or his leering <a href=""http://youtu.be/QsFrFQ-F64Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Victoria’s Secret ad</a>. In the '60s, Sinatra was arguably for squares; entrenched in Vegas and disdainful of rock'n'roll (which he had called ""the most brutal, ugly, desperate, vicious form of expression it has been my misfortune to hear""), he represented the establishment against which the counterculture was kicking, and that made him a kind of anti-Dylan. And then there’s the fact that crooning is all about the voice—making it smooth yet expressive, agile yet graceful. Just as Dylan’s songwriting exploded the notion of the tightly structured pop tune, his voice has roundly rejected the notion that pop singers must sound pretty.</p>
<p>While it may prompt some exasperated debates, Dylan has in fact been teasing this project for years, if not decades. A few of the songs on <i>Shadows in the Night </i>have appeared sporadically in his setlists since the 1990s, and in his 2004 memoir, <i>Chronicles, Volume One,</i> Dylan even professed his fandom for the Chairman of the Board, even if he subtly admitted that the crooner wasn’t exactly a popular figure among the folkies in the Village: ""When Frank sang [""Ebb Tide""], I could hear everything in his voice—death, God and the universe, everything. I had other things to do, though, and I couldn’t be listening to that stuff much.""</p>
<p>In other words, <i>Shadows in the Night</i> represents a lifelong appreciation for Sinatra, but more than that, Dylan is toasting a very specific era in pop songwriting. He’s not interested in aping the man’s vocal style (which would be laughable) or retreading his signature tunes (which would be redundant). There’s no ""Strangers in the Night"" or ""My Way"" on here, nor is there a single dooby-dooby-doo. Instead, Dylan digs deep, picking personal favorites rather than obvious hits. ""Some Enchanted Evening"" and ""That Lucky Old Sun"" may be familiar to many listeners, but others, like ""Stay With Me"" and ""Where Are You?"" are more obscure, which allows Dylan to put his stamp on them without sounding like he’s falling back on that late-career cliché: the standards album.</p>
<p>Rather than mimic the robust orchestral arrangements that define Sinatra’s catalog, Dylan strips these songs down considerably. According to a <a href=""http://www.bobdylan.com/us/news/new-album-shadows-night-out-feb-3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">statement</a> on his website, he’s not covering them, but ""uncovering"" them: ""Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day."" There are some gentle horn charts on ""The Night We Called It a Day"", but they’re generally unobtrusive, included less for dramatic effect and more for simple ambience. His small band accompanies him sensitively and sympathetically, often playing so quietly that it sounds like Dylan is singing a cappella. The lead instrument here is Donny Herron’s pedal steel, which is so crucial to the album’s moonlit ambience that it might as well hang the stars from the night sky.</p>
<p>And what do you know, Dylan can actually sing. Without sounding overly reverent, he croons persuasively, especially on ""Why Try to Change Me Now"". That song, recorded by Sinatra in 1959 for his album <i>No One Cares</i>, resonates powerfully on <i>Shadows in the Night</i>, with a performance so assured you might think Dylan wrote it himself. And perhaps that’s why Dylan gravitates to these tunes. Never the most confessional songwriter—he dodges more than he professes—he has remained guarded about his inner life, making him both the most studied songwriter of the rock era and also the least known. But ""Why Try to Change Me Now"" may be one of the most revealing tunes he has sung in the twentieth century, allowing him to settle into the role of the lovable curmudgeon, a man who understands he’s a mess but is too old to change. It’s the best reason he’s given for recording this album.</p>
<p>Because these songs seemingly reveal some new facets of Dylan’s character and celebrity, they comprise a fascinating and conceptually rich object whose meaning will be debated and dissected for years to come. In particular <i>Shadows in the Night</i> asks us to hear these crooner anthems as folk tunes, as though Sinatra was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26811-pete-seeger/"">Seeger</a> with a tux and a stint at the Sands. While ignoring social or political dilemmas, they speak to certain emotional conundrums common to everyone: how to live with love and heartbreak, how to survive on whimsy and regret. Trying to explain the nature of attraction on ""Some Enchanted Evening"", Dylan offers a sly wink as he sings, ""Fools offer reasons, wise men never try."" Especially in such a popular tune, the line takes on fresh gravity in the context of Dylan’s career, as though he could be quoting one of his own songs.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p><i>Shadows in the Night</i> may pose some compelling questions for the Bobophiles who scrutinize every line and every word of every Dylan song, but for the more casual, less obsessive listener, it can be a bit of a snooze. The songs are well chosen and certainly revealing, but Dylan and his band play them all pretty much the same, sacrificing any sense of rhythm for stately ambience. Once they strike a mood on opener ""I’m a Fool to Want You"", they never stray from it. That gives <i>Shadows</i> a distinctive identity in Dylan’s catalog, but it also has a leveling effect. Each song hits the same tempo and strikes the same tone, so that swoon quickly turns somnambulant. As the album progresses, the songs sound more and more emotionally muted, as though this style of American pop songwriting was good only for providing ruminative ambience rather than sophisticated humor, feisty insight, or infectious rhythm. Say what you want about Sinatra, but at least the man could swing.</p></div>"|20190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20190-shadows-in-the-night/|6.2|Stephen M. Deusner

<p dir=""ltr"">As profiles and reviews have regularly pointed out, Joey Bada$$ wasn't alive for any of these albums' release dates. That's not really the issue here, though it's easy to draw conclusions from that fact; when the weight of influence an artist carries has the additional weight of history piled on, that can't be good for the backbone. But as his career has developed, from the claim-staking mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16864-1999/"" target=""_blank""><i>1999</i></a> to the moody regrouping effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18276-joey-bada-summer-knights/"" target=""_blank""><i>Summer Knights</i></a> to a litany of guest verses (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>'s ""1 Train""; the remix of Madgibbs' ""Knicks""), he still hasn't strayed far from that two-decades-past area of influence, a narrow purview that's resulted in some fine mood music but little that's been transcendent or reinventive. Official debut <i>B4.DA.$$</i> keeps that frustrating formula going.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And make no mistake, <i>B4.DA.$$</i> is a case of squandered resources rather than some expected mediocrity inoffensively met. It sets a compelling mood well—a restless-youth disbelief in actually making it, even when all the evidence is laid out in front of him, until finally the cloud cover breaks and it all starts registering. (One of his most unguarded moments of cynicism-shaking excitement comes at the end of ""Piece of Mind"": A jailed friend admits that he caught Joey's new single on the radio and Joey's reaction—""oh, you heard that shit!""—is pure, hard-earned pride.) And even at their most obvious, the beats nail that East Coast melancholy winter sensation, whether coming from vets of the era Joey nods back to (DJ Premier on ""Paper Trail$""; a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">Roots</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla"">Dilla</a> reconstruction on ""Like Me"") or Pro Era hands like Kirk Knight (""Big Dusty""; ""Hazeus View"") and Chuck Strangers (""Escape 120""; ""Black Beetles""). Some of the homages are blatant to the point of distracting; if you can hear Statik Selektah's beat for ""No. 99"" and not scoff at the idea of putting a Canal Street ""Scenario"" knockoff in the middle of an otherwise moody album, I envy your reserve. But the heavy traditional soul-jazz/boom-bap backing is at least well-executed, and the occasional shakeup via drum'n'bass-adjacent uptempo breaks (""Escape 120""; bonus track ""Teach Me"") is welcome. You could do far worse than to pick this record up for meditative late nights or bad-weather commutes, where it's best to just zone out and let the vibe sneak up on you.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But the catch for an MC aiming his sights at the pantheon of stylistic greatness circa '93-'94 is that the people who appreciate that music the most—</span><span>especially </span><span>the people who came of age with it as their soundtrack when that shit was new—are also the least forgiving when it comes to lyrical complacency. And with a voice and a flow barely distinct enough to be instantly recognizable just yet, there's no margin of error for Joey here. There aren't enough intricate lines to make up for the ones so flatly familiar they feel like placeholders: check one-verser ""Christ Conscious"" and its opening-line ""Motherfuckin' microphone checker/ Keep that grip tight, like my Smith &amp; Wesson"" couplet, </span><span>then </span><span>realize that there's still Namedrop 101 references to Ike Turner, ""Dragon Ball"", and </span><i>Thriller</i><span>-era Michael on the way. There aren't enough unexpected detours to compensate for the constant quasi-iconoclastic invocations of other artists' well-known hooks, with ""Paper Trail$"" and its nuance-draining ""Cash ruined everything around me"" maybe the most egregious. And most disappointing of all, there's not enough spark to the rhymes to excuse the goofy metaphors (""Hazeus View"": ""I'm a titan, like Zeus I enlighten 'em/ Kick flows till it's kung fu fightin' 'em""). He's still relatively young, but Joey's experienced enough worth sharing that it feels like his words are inadequate to even cover its scope.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And that's what separates albums like this from records you just kind of shrug at and move on from. Joey's less than a month into his twenties and he's already lost a close friend in Capital STEEZ, is trying to figure out his place in the rap world (and the rest of the world) under a social media microscope, and has to live up to being the type of new-hope torch-carrier who can get friggin' </span><span>Primo </span><span>to do a beat for him. Through all of this, he still has to develop and evolve, in public, after already setting a precedent for himself as an ambassador for the aesthetic of a previous, endlessly revered and long-lamented era. That he can hint at who he really is beneath the simplistic words and still-developing voice is a good sign, and with the opportunity to vent on this record—dealing with money woes (""Paper Trail$""), strengthening familial ties (""Curry Chicken""), reflecting on a childhood he's growing out of yet still strongly shaped by (""O.C.B."", short for ""only child blues"")—he's gradually but noticeably building up a real identity on record. But if that next level's within reach, there has to be one obstacle to overcome: Firsthand truths take longer to sink in when they're delivered with secondhand styles.</span></p></div>"|20146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20146-joey-bada-b4da/|7.0|Nate Patrin

For those of us who grew up discretely smoking clove cigarettes while listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1030-dead-can-dance/"">Dead Can Dance</a> records in the '80s, seeing goth culture hijacked by the likes of Hot Topic and Korn was something more tragic than Rozz Williams’ suicide. It was the death of an aesthetic. Goth became, for all intents and purposes, a pejorative.</p>
<p>So it’s with no small sense of gratitude that, in recent years, aging goths such as myself have seen a slew of young bands (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30162-trust/"">Trust</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4990-the-horrors/"">the Horrors</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"">Zola Jesus</a>) exploring the genre’s spidery, tear-stained roots. Such is the case with Australia’s Nite Fields, a four-piece band whose full-length debut, the somber <i>Depersonalisation</i>, could almost pass for a long-lost <i>Lonely Is an Eyesore</i>-era <a href=""http://www.4ad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4AD</a> compilation from the late '80s. That the record so thoroughly mimics its forbears—imagine a nearly seamless union of vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> (when they still leaned more heavily on guitars than synths), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_of_Xymox"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clan of Xymox</a>, and early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>—is both a blessing and a curse. <i>Depersonalisation</i><b><i> </i></b>plays with a kind of intense familiarity that goes down so easily that the record seems to end before it even gets started—like a fog that rolls through the room and evaporates before you realize it was there. Clocking in at 35 minutes, the nine songs (two of which are instrumental) are both beautiful and slight, which in this case turns out to be the perfect combination.</p>
<p>Aligning dark atmospherics with a basic rock setup, <i>Depersonalisation</i><b><i> </i></b>is a thing of mostly spectral simplicity. Front man Danny Venzin’s voice hovers somewhere in the range of ghostly baritone, which lends standout tracks like ""Fill the Void"" and ""Hell Happy"" a perfect, deathly glamour. ""You want to whip the heart from my inside/ take away the beat,"" he intones on ""Prescription""—a track that boasts guitar lines that would have made both Peter Hook and Robert Smith cry envious tears of blood at some point in 1983. It’s also a song that strongly puts forth the record’s most pervasive themes—disassociation, dissipation, disappointment, evaporation—all of which are echoed in the record’s consistently moribund lyrics: ""I go out in the night/ Nothing happens but nothing’s something.""</p>
<p>Given the perfectly considered aesthetic of <i>Depersonalisation</i>, it’s not surprising that the band’s front man also runs a record label (Brisbane’s <a href=""http://lostrace.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lost Race</a>, specializing in ""Unpopular Music from Australia"") or that the band cites ""Michael Hutchence on a rope"" as an influence on their Facebook page. They may be unrepentantly moody, but they are not entirely humorless. The way in which Nite Fields melds nihilist post-punk with Cocteau-friendly shoegaze vibes indicates a coterie of musicians who have likely spent a lifetime absorbing old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1077-dif-juz/"">Dif Juz</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4217-this-mortal-coil/"">This Mortal Coil</a> records. Nowhere is this fascination more evident than album closer ""Winter’s Gone""—a seven-minute moodscape that unspools some serious <i>The Moon and the Melodies</i>-style <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd/"">Harold Budd</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1807-robin-guthrie/"">Robin Guthrie</a> guitar ripples (complete with underwater saxophone squalls) that one wishes could go on for approximately forever. For those who grew up worshipping at the altar of such ephemeral sounds, a record like<i> Depersonalisation</i><i> </i>is a welcome bit of gloom, even if it ultimately feels like a record you probably already own.</p></div>"|20106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20106-depersonalisation/|6.5|T.

The problem with that story is that Thomas isn’t much of a grappler when it comes to making records. </span><i>Boogalou Reed</i><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">, released less than a year after </span><i>Louder Space</i><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">, finds him still cockily speeding along, cranking out high-octane, hip-hop-influenced garage rock like it’s a spiritual calling.</span></p>
<p>Even if Thomas is a song-making factory, <i>Boogalou Reed</i> sounds nothing like an assembly line. In contrast to <i>Louder Space—</i>his first full-on exploration of his rap leanings—this is more of a straight-up garage-punk album, filled with hyper-fuzz guitars, stomping beats, and snarling vocals. That’s reflected in some of Thomas’s rock-history-sniffing song titles: ""Cynthia Piper at the Gates of Dawn"", ""Too Punk Shakur"", the title track. Judged solely on the scale of how hard it rocks, <i>Boogalou Reed</i> is a head-rinsing success.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But Thomas has been at his craft too long to settle for anything that simple. He knows the value of head-down rock action, but he also knows how to layer that with something more complex. Most of these 15 tracks are miles-deep sonically, with guitars piled high, beats thickened into gunshots, and vocals that morph hip-hop fire with punk frenzy. The result is just as varied—albeit in a sneakier way—as <i>Louder Space</i>. Blink and you might miss the twists and turns, as Thomas dives into sultry noise-R&amp;B (""Situation""), stoner grunge (""Protopipe""), rap-metal (""Watching You""), organ-driven '60s rock (""Empire""), and even a demolishing cover of ""Ohio"" that beats <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young </a>at his own guitar-growl game.</p>
<p>What glues all these sides of Obnox together is the way Thomas infects every moment with electricity. The lightning-bolt energy that courses through <i>Boogalou Reed</i>’s 15 tracks is a kind of genre of its own, a sonic signature that Thomas can fit many styles into without losing the mark of his bold handwriting. As he <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/obnox-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">put it </a>recently, ""White cats can get into it. Hip-hop niggas can get into it. Punks can get into it. Indie rock dude, he’s already in. Noiseheads. It’s all in there."" Yet none of those categories takes over; you never get the sense that Thomas is trying on costumes or speaking a second language. His supreme confidence steamrolls any worries of dilettantism.</p>
<p>Steamrolling is basically Thomas’ job now. Since launching Obnox after years spent in some of Ohio’s best garage bands, he’s slammed forward with all the force of a smoke-blowing engine. (He’s already got another record on the way soon, a ""punk rock concept album"" called <i>Know America</i> about taking over a radio station.) But that steamroller metaphor doesn’t catch how Thomas’ music is as subtle as it is pummeling. His business is all about charging forward, but his art is about more than just the moment.</p></div>"|20168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20168-boogalou-reed/|7.8|Marc Masters

Details are always tantalizingly scant in Adam Turla's lyrics, but the narrator seems to have decided that he would rather embrace darkness and death than burden his loved ones any longer. ""I just don’t want to be another chore, some wounded bird to care for,"" he sings over a manically strummed guitar, a rambling banjo, and a live-wire bass. The song is more about epiphany than action, yet the music is a flurry of commotion: not downbeat but quick-paced, not resigned but unburdened and celebratory. Turla sings excitedly, as though professing love rather than suicide, and Sarah Balliet delivers a cello solo that’s scratchy and energetic, yet also inscrutable. Her playing is almost scolding, perhaps even taunting, as though there is more to the situation than the narrator is telling us.</span></p>
<p>For fifteen years these two elements—Turla’s husky voice and Balliet’s tectonic cello—have formed the foundation of Murder by Death’s dark country gothic sound, coloring their tales of thwarted lust and grim violence as they fashion a new mythology form the southern Indiana soil. Those two founding members have provided the band’s most distinctive sounds, and their musical conflict—they play against each other as often as they play with each other—has fortified even their weaker material and distinguished them from the hordes of other country-leaning groups that have come and gone in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>Their early albums, especially <i>Like the Exorcist, but More Breakdancing</i>, possessed a dark humor and raw energy, as though the band had crossed the police tape to record at the actual scene of the crime. As Murder by Death has progressed—as they have shed and gained new members, as they have relocated from Bloomington to Louisville—they have grown bigger in their sound and brasher in their arrangements, incorporating more and more instruments with each album. <i>Big Dark Love</i> bustles with soundtrack keyboards, sequencers that could be held together with rusty barbed wire, and a mandolin that sounds like a jackhammer. Opener ""I Shot an Arrow"" thrums on a dated drum loop, while ""Solitary One"" features a horn line that may be playing at gunpoint.</p>
<p>In other words, this is Murder by Death’s most ambitious album to date, yet it is also their least weird, their most crowded, and arguably their most inconsequential. Recorded with co-producer Kevin Ratterman (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a>, fellow Louisvillains Houndmouth) and mixed by John Congleton (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a>), <i>Big Dark Love </i>buffs away the band’s rougher edges, including relegating Balliet’s cello from lead to supporting role. Instead, they resort routinely to dramatic choruses and rousing crescendos, as though trying to persuade us of the bigness and the darkness of these characters’ conflicts. Too often, however, its sound has just the opposite effect: The arrangements distract from the stories rather than bolster them, making it difficult to immerse ourselves in these peculiar worlds.</p>
<p>This is a drier, grayer Americana than we’re used to hearing from Murder by Death, who sound practiced and professional yet less ominous, less commanding. As a result, Turla’s storytelling suffers. Traditionally, he has gravitated toward characters who are arriving at a crossroads that demands bold action or immediate acquiescence, and that indecision has fueled the gothic quality of previous albums. On the title track, however, Turla has trouble convincing us of the magnitude of these crises, even when the song explodes in skyscraper synths and ritualistic drums. It could be a parody of masculine insistence, but it comes off as less goth and more ick. That’s one of two stalker anthems on <i>Big Dark Love</i>, the other being closer ""Hunted"". Opening with Turla’s voice distorted to sound like it’s emanating through an old Victrola, the song builds predictably to its melodramatic finish—a surefire show-closer on the festival circuit, but an anticlimax on the record. As the band churn up sound and fury, we can hear the strident strains of Balliet’s cello, scribbling suicide notes in the background and lending some gravity to an album that sounds, tragically, weightless.</p></div>"|20194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20194-big-dark-love/|5.8|Stephen M.

The group’s membership has always been in flux: It began life as a duo (M.C. Taylor and Scott Hirsch), then shrank to a solo project, then ballooned into a full band. With Paul Shaffer playing along, the new line-up turned ""Southern Grammar"" into something similarly unrecognizable. On last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19681-hiss-golden-messenger-lateness-of-dancers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lateness of Dancers</i></a> it was a languid number, with a laidback tempo and a wistful ambience that hid darker depths. On Letterman’s stage, however, the song got up out of its rocker and danced in the yard. The band goosed that mathematical guitar riff to make it sound spiky and insistent, transforming the song from an interior monologue into an extroverted Southern rocker. It’s a testament to the mutability of Taylor’s songwriting that ""Southern Grammar"" can sound so remarkably different with just a few tweaks, but the song supports both interpretations: the nodding reverie and the waking celebration.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">The live version that anchors Hiss Golden Messenger’s new EP is not the Letterman performance, but a similar recording from WXPN in Philadelphia that features yet another lineup. The band’s touring roster includes Hirsch, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29649-phil-cook/"">Phil Cook</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, Matt McCaughan of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, Alexandra Sauser-Monnig of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28236-mountain-man/"">Mountain Man</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, and saxophonist Matt Douglas of the Small Ponds. Playing loosely, they quickly establish a stuttering groove that’s ultimately more Allmans than Appalachian. The sax is crucial: When the song opens, Douglas plays that riff just behind the beat, ghosting Taylor’s guitar and making the song crackle precariously, opening it up in a way that belies its cry for simplicity. This take on ""Southern Grammar"" may not be quite as startlingly exclamatory as the television version, but the band sounds grittier, more animated, more volatile than you might expect.</span></p>
<p><i>Southern Grammar</i>, however, is not a rousing live EP, as its title track might suggest; instead, the remaining two songs are studio-bound and downtempo—the band at its most contemplative. ""He Wrote the Book"" may be the most Bible-bound song Taylor has written, which is saying a lot. Especially after ""Grammar"", the pace plods, but the arrangement is gently lush, founded on a churchly piano, a rattling snare, and a gathering of reeds that transforms this sunny Sunday morning hymn into a slow-burn soul number. It conveys the contentment that comes at the end of a long journey, yet the next song, ""Brother, Do You Know the Road?"" fades in like we’re catching up to Hiss Golden Messenger in the middle of an especially arduous trek. The rhythm section lopes along, trudging yet determined to make the next ridge, and Taylor coaxes a tremulous solo out of his guitar—short but powerful. This sojourner’s dirge is a call-and-response between the songwriter and his band, who answer only, ""Yes, my brother, I know the road,"" to convey a palpable world-weariness that is less physical than spiritual.</p>
<p>To their credit, Hiss Golden Messenger never sound weary. In whatever form the band might take, they convey too much joy and direction in creating the music and making the journey. Despite its subdued momentum, <i>Southern Grammar </i>still sounds like an exclamation point at the end of <i>Lateness of Dancers</i>, echoing that album’s celebratory cry while also warning of all the miles that lay ahead of this band. ""What are you worried about?"" Letterman asked the band, only somewhat rhetorically. ""We’re not worried about anything,"" was Taylor’s apt answer.</p></div>"|20092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20092-southern-grammar-ep/|7.2|Stephen M. Deusner

But seriously: in the late 1980s, Half Japanese were a song machine. Their three LPs released in the last three years of that decade—<i>Music to Strip By</i>, <i>Charmed Life</i>, and <i>The Band That Would Be King—</i>boasted 70 songs, with nearly 40 more appended to CD and cassette versions. Unlike much of their 1980 triple-LP debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17841-half-japanese-12-gentlemen-not-beasts/"">½ Gentlemen / Not Beasts</a></i>, little on these albums, now issued together by <a href=""http://www.firerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fire</a> as <i>Volume 2: 1987-1989,</i> is noisy or abstract. Most of the songs have verses, choruses, even bridges. And many could stick in your head for years.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Half Japanese’s stunning knack for cranking out two-minute gems during this period is even more impressive given how tumultuous that time was. The core of the band to that point was brothers David and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1439-jad-fair/"">Jad Fair</a>, who conceived and launched Half Japanese from a bedroom in their parents’ house. So it had to be a blow when, before the recording of <i>Music to Strip By, </i>David exited the group. He had written as many Half Japanese songs as Jad and was their in-house philosopher, espousing the virtues of ignoring musical rules.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But Half Japanese’s arc by this point had a magical inevitability, a progress immune even to fundamental change. Their music had grown more accessible with every record after <i>½ Gentlemen / Not Beasts</i>, and Jad had become increasingly adept at funnelling his obsessions into songs that were charming, frank, comical, and weird. His vision was so strong, in fact, that the many contributors here—including Shimmy Disc head/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"">Galaxie 500</a> producer Kramer, ex-Velvet Monkey Don Fleming, and avant-garde stalwarts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1569-fred-frith/"">Fred Frith</a>—all unite under Jad, complementing his unique voice rather than diluting it. David is actually on <i>Charmed Life </i>(recorded before <i>Music to Strip By </i>but released after)<i>, </i>and his influence is felt on all three records, but Jad is clearly the star of this triple feature.</p>
<p>From that star shines a deceptively naïve sensibility. Jad sings about love with words that could be lifted from a high schooler’s notebook, in a geeky voice that seems allergic to conventional pitch. But a close listen reveals slyly clever wordplay and suprisingly versatile singing. All three albums are filled with sharp couplets that turn cliches over (""I read the writing on the wall/ In fact I’m the guy that wrote it""), dole out absurd jokes (""I could stuff my pockets full of 10 dollar bills/ But then where would I put all these 20s?"") and state things so plainly (""I used to have fun but now I don’t/ The things I did now I won’t"") that they cut straight to the gut. Jad varies his phrasing to match these surging sentiments, creating a counterpoint to the spot-on music. When the band grinds out a groove behind his half-rhythmic/half-blank cadences, the woozy disconnect—the way they alternately meet and diverge—is oddly compelling, like the nerdy cousin to the rants of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6554-mark-e-smith/"">Mark E. Smith</a> atop the repetitions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall</a>.</p>
<p>Jad’s versatility is also reflected in the thematic distinctions between these three albums. True to its name, <i>Music to Strip By</i> is the most prurient, perhaps even the sleaziest of the three. Many of its songs are crooked blues, with the subject of sex dealt with in guilelessly-blunt terms (""Sex at Your Parents’ House"" opens with ""Tonight we’ll have sex/ Sex at your parents’ house""). The tunes are often skeletal, relying on Jad’s voice to carry the show, and he steps up to that duty impressively.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Compared to </span><i>Music to Strip By</i><span>, </span><i>Charmed Life</i><span> is fuller, more realized, and simply greater. There’s a bright hook, a snappy turn of phrase, or a funny story in every song. Tunes pour into each other to build a narrative, detailing an earnest journey toward some kind of love. And the band is synced almost telepathically, their flowing parts connecting like puzzle pieces.

The first two verses have ended, a small string section has pushed the tune onto a carousel that might have suited Van Dyke Parks in his prime, and an ascendant third verse has thrust Blackshaw into a place he’s never been: a vocal hook that he has to sing himself. ""The needless noise you air,"" he offers gently, the instrumentalist’s voice so soft and uncertain at the start of each word that he almost drops ""the."" ""Echoes everywhere,"" he ends, pushing the last syllable with such force it seems he’s using his last bit of breath. It’s guileless, charming, and the anchor of a masterful few minutes of acoustic pop so good they make you ask an unlikely question: Why hasn’t James Blackshaw been singing all along?</p>
<p>A decade ago, Blackshaw emerged as a leading young stylist for instrumental acoustic guitar music. He’d started as many of his peers have, offering knotty revisions of songs with ""blues"" or ""rag"" appended to the title. (See <a href=""http://music.bladudflies.com/album/apologia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last year’s reissue</a> of his pleasing if predictable 2003 debut, <i>Apologia</i>, by example.) But he soon assimilated new influences into his six- and 12-string songs, from a classical grandeur borrowed from romantic composers to immersive atmospheres that seemed to reflect an interest in mysticism. Between 2006 and 2010, he issued a string of impossibly beautiful records in that vein, epitomized by his cascading <a href=""http://www.tompkinssquare.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tompkins Square</a> debut, <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i>. Droning chords provided ballast beneath fluid fingerpicking, gilded sometimes by coruscating piano and strings. Blackshaw had transcended those formative blues to reposition existential sadness and spiritual wonder as self-made sanctuaries of sound.</p>
<p>But for the last half-decade, and perhaps even while he was issuing those pivotal albums, Blackshaw struggled with what might come next. He didn’t abandon his resplendent aims so much as try to find new ways to deploy them—intricate collaborations with lutist Jozef Van Wissem, improvisational exaltations with pianist Lubomyr Melnyk, accompaniment for the recent Current 93 records of fellow English seeker David Tibet. He tried contemplative classical guitar and clanging piano for 2012’s <i>Love Is the Plan, the Plan Is Death</i>. He built jazz-influenced, full-band noir for a live score to the 100-year-old silent film <i>Le faux magistrat</i>. All of it was fine, but none of it sparkled with the same sense of discovery his records once held. For the last several years, then, Blackshaw’s albums possessed an air of steady discontent and the demand that comes in trying to fix it.</p>
<p>For someone whose recent output has been so seeking and fitful, especially someone who has never before sung on record, <i>Summoning Suns </i>is remarkably decisive and self-assured. Blackshaw’s first recorded attempt at writing lyrics and singing them opens and ends with brief but significant instrumentals. ""Averoigne"" collapses the dramatic thrust of his work on the <i>Magistrat</i> score into two perfect minutes, glockenspiel and piano playing games of melodic ping pong over a roaring organ; ""Winter Flies"" is a modest reprise of Blackshaw’s career-making guitar majesty, his round sound and rippling strings suggesting a symphony tucked inside a soft gig bag. The core, though, comes in the shape of five bright, smart, and sad acoustic pop numbers. It’s as if, after years of letting the guitar speak for his thoughts and feelings, Blackshaw decided he might make his melancholy resonate anew by giving it a more direct voice—that is, his own.</p>
<p>The allure is instant: ""Confetti"", that second song, is as memorable and muted as the best of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O’Rourke</a>’s pop cuts, and it reinforces O’Rourke’s love of extreme lyrical and musical dissonance. The drums gallop, the strings glide and Blackshaw’s guitar dances. But he and Annie Nilsson, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeXOWkM2MUI&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the daughter of an obvious influence for such winking-while-grimacing fare</a>, sing of suicide in bad motels and people so worthless they’re stealing the air from the rest of us. ""Abusing angels, tearing their wings out,"" the pair softly intone, distending that last word to ensure you snag the sinister edge sticking from what seems a sweet song. ""Nothing Ever After"" and the title track chase self-doubt with more of it. In one, Blackshaw—somehow too beguiling to actually sound bitter—alludes to his public reputation as a white-hot guitarist who was never quite satisfied with that status. As the strings rise around the guitar, the effect feels like a high-fidelity treatment of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a>’s <i>Roman Candle</i>. On the latter number, Blackshaw acknowledges his self-destructive faults but turns them into a jubilant homage to the trouble they make. Piano and strings, drums, and his acoustic cavort beneath the confessions, positioning the song less about personal failure than dealing with it.</p>
<p>Picking apart Blackshaw’s references on <i>Summoning Suns</i> makes for easy sport. There’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8648-van-morrison/"">Van Morrison</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4970-bert-jansch/"">Bert Jansch</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Denny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandy Denny</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"">Joanna Newsom</a>, the aforementioned Nilsson and Smith. Between the splashy sadness of ""Confetti"" and the Japanese tourism of ""Towa No Yume"", a pretty duet with Kaoru Noda, its writer, the cynical might even wonder if Blackshaw has recognized the (limited?) market potential of a world where Jim O’Rourke no longer sings. But <i>Summoning </i><i>Suns</i> is a near-complete stylistic restart for Blackshaw, so of course some touchstones are clear. What matters more, however, is the preternatural ease he seems to have with this idiosyncratic pop, where the pedal steel peeks out from unorthodox places and the voices slide in uncanny curves. Sure, stylistic and mechanical hesitations pepper these seven songs, but even those instances feel mostly like the charming reservations of a brilliant beginner. That’s an unexpected status for James Blackshaw in 2015, but <i>Summoning Suns</i> and the future it could portend warrant the inertia they follow.</p></div>"|20093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20093-summoning-suns/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

Certainly some degree of bravery is involved, but also naked desperation and a disregard for personal safety, and maybe you don't wanna sink that far into the darkness anyway. Two Gallants' new album lives down there in the depths, their most defeated, defeatist statement. Its emotional timbre is best described as abysmal—and this from a band that has continually found virtue in failure and upheld self-loathing as a form of self-awareness.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">There's very little virtue in <i>We Are Undone, </i>no emotional state upheld so much as examined and then discarded<i>. </i>It plays like a flag of surrender, singer/guitarist Adam Stephens and drummer Tyson Vogel sounding wrung out by their own integrity. Maybe it's a creative adaptation for a band born and raised in San Francisco: The city today, hypergentrified by web-enabled strivers and rich kids, bears little resemblance to the one that began nurturing their talents more than a decade ago. In its often inchoate roar, <i>We Are Undone</i> bears little resemblance to the laser-focus punk-blues of their earlier work. The songs just aren't as good.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The most satisfying callback to Two Gallants' halcyon, mid-'00s prime comes in the album's second half. ""My Man Go"" demonstrates the patience and melodic intelligence that incites 2Gs live shows into sing-and-sway mosh pits. ""In the ruins of my night I can still pretend,"" Stephens sings over acoustic guitar, ""close my eyes, see my life as it could have been."" ""Katy Kruelly"" references 200-some years of American folk-music tradition, from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War to early 20th-century race records to '60s folk revivalism. As presented here, the song glows with Stephens' voice and acoustic guitar, as much a history lesson as a beautiful ballad of loss. It segues directly into ""Heartbreakdown"", another slow, somber number, literary in its lyricism and oozing regret.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""There's So Much I Don't Know"" closes the album with an anti-gentrification anthem that's equal parts preservationist and xenophobic. City living in 2015 is a thorny subject; urban evolution is a process both inevitable and stomach-churning. In the case of San Francisco, wealthy people are displaced by even wealthier people—plains-bred newcomers ""trying to make it rain."" Two Gallants rightly addresses the issue in folk-song form, but Stephens' response is to begrudge, flee, and burn the city to the ground on his way out. Die-yuppie-scum middle fingering is an appropriate first response of the self-possessed dispossessed, but it can't be the last. ""All things blow eventually/ There's so much I don't know,"" goes the chorus. I wish there were more to say than that.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Which is the overall sense the album leaves: The band wields the same righteous fury as always, regardless of a world evolving around them, without them. The only obvious shift within <i>Undone</i> is in Stephens' guitar tone, which occasionally takes on prog-ish, Malmsteenian melodrama—not necessarily for the best. That guitar roars into a satisfyingly ferocious riff on the album-opening title track, but thematically the song echoes ""Waves of Grain"" from their 2006 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8262-what-the-toll-tells/""><i>What the Toll Tells</i></a>, pitting a young idealist versus an aging cynic in a sort of epistolary folk-metal showdown. This time around the singer remains agnostic. Cynicism is realism. And that resignation hurts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This band has articulated youthful frustration so well for so long but what comes next? What's below rock bottom? At least the jaunty ""Fools Like Us"" injects a dose of what-me-worry? haplessness into the album a few songs later. But otherwise, we're left hurt and hopeless. Nobody should have to live like that.</p></div>"|20129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20129-we-are-undone/|6.9|Jonathan Zwickel

The kind of ""smooth"" that you pronounce in a way that becomes a tongue massage—<i>smoooooooooth</i>. But not ""smooth"" in the way people can be, synonymous with ""oily"" or ""slick,"" denoting a kind of facile charm that can make you like someone you otherwise find objectionable. In fact, it’s very difficult to ascribe any sort of personality trait to All We Are based on the available evidence. Should that matter if they’re dedicating <i>their</i> time to <i>your</i> makeout music? Seems a bit ungrateful. So <i>All We Are </i>is smooth in the manner of an accessory to seduction; it’s the feel of cool lotion on your back. It’s a roll around on high-thread count sheets.</p>
<p>If you were to call All We Are ""edgeless,"" they’d likely take it as a compliment, as they pride themselves on pristine blends; their members originate from Norway, Ireland, and Brazil but met at college in Liverpool and maintain a distinct, buttoned-up Britishness. And their music serves as a kind of mixtape caulk, each song a viable transition between the distinguished names in a type of nominal ""indie rock"" which consists of bands with a rock setup playing some variation of what most would consider R&amp;B. The pinging guitars on ""Intro""—as well as the existence of a track called ""Intro"", itself—instantly brings <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx"">the xx</a> to mind, as do the group’s cooed, co-ed vocals which equate standoffishness with sex appeal.</p>
<p>But musically, All We Are most often hew towards the fleshier, aloe-infused bath and body works of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye"">Rhye</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"">Wild Beasts</a>' simmering art-funk. You might be able to spot Dan Carey’s production work on <i>All We Are</i> based on sound alone<span>—</span>the guitars are all silvered, textured like liquid mercury or glitter paint, the drums are crisp and exact. It’s the sound of live musicians meant to be sampled for club remixes. It’s all-too-common to say that music of this sort was intended for high-end boutiques (even if it was written in a Norwegian cabin), though by comparing a lover to clothing on ""I Wear You"", All We Are aren’t ducking those shots.</p>
<p>It’s timely, though none of it sounds trendy<span>—</span>the instrumental chops are there, and All We Are play with earnestness. Every variation of runway indie is within their grasp: they can do a soul bump-and-grind (""Utmost Good"") and hyperventilating funk-pop (""Honey""). But All We Are haven’t found their voice yet, in either a figurative and literal sense. As musicians, All We Are can accessorize, but they also treat lyrics like socks, nonchalantly grabbing the first matching pair out of a drawer of regulars: ""There’s something about you,"" ""I need you, baby, to keep me alive,"" ""I want you, can’t get you out of my head/ I just want to do it again,"" ""Honey, you got to feel it with somebody."" It’s difficult to extract any exact feeling anyone experienced at any point; all three members contribute vocals and none generate the force that could nudge <i>All We Are</i> out of its indistinct mood of either vague amorousness or manageable heartbreak.</p>
<p><i>All We Are</i> makes a stylish first impression, showing up so impeccably tailored that you wonder if it secretly fears all of that fumbling human contact that could mess things up. The most compelling moments on the record occur when the trio drop that pose and function like an actual rock band. The best hooks are mostly sibilation, a couple of hooted ""oohs"" on ""I Wear You"", rapturous sighs on ""Stone"". Meanwhile, the back half of <i>All We Are</i> is filled with slow jams that barely stir from a post-coital heap. The album peaks twice, the exact same way—on ""Stone"" and ""Keep Me Alive"", All We Are slowly build on glistening guitars for five minutes before Guro Gikling just lets it rip, similar to Carey’s previous charges <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"">Caroline Polachek</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes"">Natasha Khan</a>. These moments add welcome contrast, but also expose a smooth record that all too rarely recognizes its need for friction.</p></div>"|20141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20141-all-we-are/|5.7|Ian Cohen

If Lil Wayne had his way, we'd be listening to </span><i>Tha Carter V</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> right now, originally scheduled for release in October, which turned into early December, which came and went with only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57713-lil-wayne-says-cash-money-refuses-to-release-tha-carter-v-wants-off-label/"" target=""_blank"">a series of frustrated tweets</a> from the rapper. It's not strange for artists to complain about the glacial pace at which record labels often move, but Wayne's tweets felt less like a display of temporary discontent and more like the words of an artist that has reached the end of their rope—it doesn't get much more black and white than ""I want off this label and nothing to do with these people."" With rumors swirling that Wayne is ready to take his label, Cash Money, along with his long-time mentor and father figure Bryan ""Birdman"" Williams <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58204-lil-wayne-to-sue-birdman-for-8-million/"" target=""_blank"">to court</a>, the possibility of a reconciliation between the estranged parties seems less and less likely with each passing day.</span></p>
<p>Amidst this intra-label drama, there feels like there's something at stake in Wayne's music again. Whereas the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15663-sorry-4-the-wait/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sorry 4 the Wait</i></a> served a similar function—it was a prime example of mixtape as apology—its sequel carries a sense that its star has his back against the wall for the first time in years. There's a purpose in Wayne's rapping that's been absent for a while, and when mentioning his current situation with Cash Money, he sounds wounded in a way he's rarely allowed himself to be. Over O.T. Genasis' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vYnas6q3Sg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""CoCo""</a>, he raps in an exasperated sigh: ""Tunechi, niggas don't appreciate you/ You've been down since day one, it meant nothing on day two.""</p>
<p>In 2015, Wayne's approach to mixtapes—rapping over beats popularized by other rappers—is an anachronism. These days, the tapes of even the greenest rappers contain mostly, if not entirely, original work. At his peak, Wayne would make beats his own through a manic inventiveness that he's still trying to recapture almost a decade later. There aren't any performances here that will have you dragging the originals to the recycle bin, but there are moments that thrill, like when he lifts the melody of Rich the Kid's hook from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVOPyIO9elM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jumpin' Like Jordan""</a> and then takes it in about eight different directions on ""Trap House"".</p>
<p>If there's a word that describes Wayne's rapping on <i>Sorry 4 the Wait 2</i>, it's ""engaged."" Wayne remains really good at the physical act of rapping, even if now you can hear the gears lurching into action whenever he switches into a double-time flow, like he does on ""Selsun Blue"", which finds him dropping quotables again (""Got the yay locked down like Kim K."") over the minor-key dread of Roofeeo's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zRvYp8QKNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All About the Money""</a> beat. With that said, what used to be knee-slappers have been forehead-palmers for a few years now, and what he presumably considers clever is usually less so by at least half. Mercifully, the groaners-per-minute ratio here is lower than usual, and this is likely due to the fact Wayne's got more than just bad sex puns on his mind.</p>
<p>Wayne's in a weird position: his style has been so thoroughly picked apart that, in many cases, rappers who have absorbed traits of his have taken them to even further extremes. For instance, ""Off Day"", the immediately-forgettable single he released in November, saw him try to play the oddball. At different points on that song, he sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"" target=""_blank"">iLoveMakonnen</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"" target=""_blank"">Young Thug</a>—basically, everyone but himself—and it's as cringe-worthy as it is transparent. On <i>Sorry 4 the Wait 2</i>, he's enjoying being Lil Wayne again, for better or worse. It also feels like rapping is once more a choice rather than a contractual obligation, which, at this point, might be the single greatest compliment one can pay Lil Wayne.</p></div>"|20186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20186-sorry-4-the-wait-2/|6.4|Renato Pagnani

For example: No one will look to this album's sonic signatures to discover the texture of R&amp;B's future. But if it's more difficult to speak to what Sullivan<i> does</i>, that's our failure, an inability to recognize R&amp;B as a discrete, heterogeneous genre. Because more than any artist, Sullivan encapsulates the breadth of R&amp;B's emotional range not by riding the margins, but from a proud position at its center. Every maneuver can appeal to about as wide a range of R&amp;B fans as exist, in 2015—aside from those looking exclusively for something ""different."" They'll have to deal with something exceptional instead.</p>
<p>""It's almost impossible to break as an African-American woman right now without TV,"" R&amp;B singer and reality TV star K. Michelle said about the harsh economic realities of being a performer to <i>Fader</i> magazine <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/12/04/k-michelle-interview%22%20target=%22_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">late last year</a>. ""Reality TV put eyes on me—but it makes it difficult when it comes to Grammy nominations."" Sullivan has built a strong fanbase without a show and despite this catch-22. Of course its hard to imagine a performer of her talent wouldn't be more widely celebrated in any other era. But though R&amp;B's commercial fortunes dropped precipitously over the past decade, Sullivan's creative success and consistency over the course of three albums (she released the equally accomplished <i>Fearless</i> in 2008 and <i>Love Me Back</i> in 2010) defy gravity. Though the title of her album can be read as coy commentary on R&amp;B's dependence on television for star-making, it can also be read simply as truth in advertising. Like many of the stories she tells, Sullivan works in layered meanings for a more convincing realism, leaving a definitive interpretation in doubt.</p>
<p>The strand running through <i>Reality Show</i> is Sullivan's performance itself, rather than any particular approach to production. Every character she inhabits is one of hard-earned principle: You may judge their choices, but they are performances of unblinking honesty and an acceptance of consequence that makes our judgement beyond the point. This often means a certain fatalism: ""#HoodLove"" is cinematic in its portrayal of a relationship's loyalty down to the .45 its protagonist packs in her purse, but the couple are poised at the precipice. ""I'ma rock this bitch till the wheels fall off,"" she sings with the conviction that they'll both be around to see exactly that happen, until finally at the end: ""And he ain't always right, but he's just right for me."" Doomed though they may be, she finds meaning in conviction.</p>
<p>Sullivan's earlier albums had a more distinct sonic approach: '90s R&amp;B in sensibility (2010's ""Holding You Down (Goin In Circles)"" used Nas' ""Affirmative Action"" beat, a familiar maneuver for many Clinton-era R&amp;B acts), Sullivan's performance was still at center stage, locating joy in demonstrative vocal runs. Here, melisma is dimmed to a purposeful shadow; when she does explore the range of her powerful voice, it's as if to indicate the loss of self-control. On ""Veins"", her voice arcs with searing, yearning electricity. Like many moments on the album, it feels like several songs at once: Its slinky rhythm and backgrounds suggest an external world of physical seduction, while the intensity of her main vocal implies the burning internal passions of anxious obsession.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though the production is unobtrusive, it seldom holds on to a single style (opener ""Dumb"" is a march, ""Stanley"" is a disco record, and ""Stupid Girl"" is an incredible song with Winehouse-lite production that may be the album's only real misstep). It's still Sullivan who gives the record its shape and tone. Her voice is one of R&amp;B's best instruments. There's a slight grain to one frequency, like a stripe of prematurely grey hair, which gives her vocals an immediately recognizable character and resonates with her stories of hard-won wisdom. Men are eyed with suspicion; ""Stupid Girl"" is a cautionary tale, but like every song it suggests multiple interpretations—""Run after the boys, or take over the world,"" Sullivan suggests, but how sincere is she? ""When you love 'em like I do, you'll be a fool."" Even on ""Masterpiece (Mona Lisa)"", about the realization of self-love, her voice suggests the dimension of pain into which it was born.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Inevitably we have to make a comparison between <i>Reality Show</i> and R&amp;B more broadly, but it's as easily expanded to popular music as a whole. Sullivan, better than singers and songwriters in almost any genre, creates worlds where relationships take on more complex dynamics, but are immediate in their effect. ""Mascara"" is complicated in its construction—the character portrait is sympathetic, damning, or neither, depending on how you hold it up to the light. Her songs work so well because they allow the listener to experience them at face value or more holistically, shifting perspectives as rapidly as in life itself. Despite this, Sullivan does not equivocate. Her point of view is not muddled. The album's closer, the rushing, cathartic ""If You Dare"", makes its argument for moral courage explicit.</p></div>"|20175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20175-reality-show/|8.1|David Drake

The Australian band have been together for a whopping 35 years and their latest album—the sprawling <i>Further/Deeper</i>—is their 21st proper full-length release. While back home in Australia they are rightly respected as titans, here in the States their legacy is tied forever to ""120 Minutes""-era college rock (specifically 1988’s eternal mix tape staple <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWxJEIz7sSA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Under the Milky Way""</a>) and for the uninitiated they presented a back catalog so long and dense as to feel a little impenetrable.</p>
<p>While it seems unlikely that <i>Further/Deeper</i> will do much to change the band’s Stateside legacy, it certainly doesn’t do anything to diminish it. The 12 tracks here deliver the same kind of languid psychedelia and pillowy atmospherics that have been a hallmark of Church albums for most of the latter half of their career. ""Love Philtre"" and ""Volkano"" are the band’s stock in trade—prolonged bits of mysticism narrated by frontman Steve Kilbey’s wry vocals. ""If you touch us we disappear/ If you are waiting we are never here"" he sings on ""Let Us Go""—a track that, quite literally, could have appeared on any number of Church albums released in the last decade.</p>
<p>This isn’t necessarily a slight to the band, who have consistently delivered this kind of shimmery alt-pop for decades now, but this kind of psychedelic sameness grows tiresome after a while. Longtime fans will note the departure of longtime guitarist Marty Willson-Piper (replaced here by Powderfinger’s Ian Haug) as denoting a shift in the band’s sound, but anyone but a hardcore devotee would likely be hard pressed to discern any radical difference. Occasionally the guitars rip and roar (""Lightning White"", ""Toy Head""), but mostly they jangle and drift through these songs like smoke...another defining characteristic of the band’s back catalog.</p>
<p>It seems unfair to expect radical reinvention from a band like the Church—a shape-shifting outfit that has spent the better part of three decades more or less circling the same singular vibe. A discography 21 albums deep evidences the kind of career that few bands ever get to experience, but that kind of back catalog can also be stifling. More than five years since their last album, 2009's <i>Untitled #23</i>, <i>Further</i> finds the band trying (in baby steps) to play around with the tropes that have been the hallmarks of their career.</p>
<p>Historically, some of the band’s best songs (""Metropolis"", ""Ripple"") have married druggy atmospherics with an airtight pop sensibility. If <i>Further/Deeper</i> fails on any front it’s that the single-appropriate pop moments feel too blandly adult contemporary (no one ever needs to write another song called ""Laurel Canyon"") and the record’s most grandly ambitious song—the epic eight-and-a-half-minute album closer—is, somewhat inexplicably, an ode to Miami. That being said, <i>Further/Deeper</i> is hardly a misstep—it’s a perfectly lovely addition to the band’s canon—but it’s not the kind of record that's going to usher in a new era or mesmerize people who haven’t already been blissed out on this band for decades.</p></div>"|20061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20061-furtherdeeper/|6.5|T.

Here's the establishing shot that opens <i>Weird Moons</i>: ""Activated midnight, actuate the beast/ Cast your spell on the bastard child blasting Judas Priest."" The stage is set for a concept album featuring werewolves, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_%28moon%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of Jupiter's moons</a>, skulking synthesizers, specters, and watchers. In the tradition that began with last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18900-jack-name-light-show/"">Light Show</a></i>, Name hasn't arbitrarily packaged some hodgepodge collection of weird songs—he's delivering a handful of tableaux to form a story arc within the same universe.</p>
<p>This isn't new territory for the man, whose recorded vocals often seem to be filtered through the guise of a character. On <i>Light Show</i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18900-jack-name-light-show/""></a>, he altered his voice to play both protagonist and antagonist in a battle between darkness and light, like a 9-year-old acting out both parts while narrating the war between his Cyclops and Magneto action figures. Name makes allegorical music, symbolic of the darkness that lives in the real world. When he was finished recording his debut album, he was diagnosed with cancer. ""I had had it for five years without even knowing,"" he <a href=""http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/tmagazine/2015/01/20/jack-name-new-album-los-angeles-musician/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. The werewolves and shape-shifters on <i>Weird Moons</i> were inspired by what his body went through during treatment. ""I can’t stand still, my body is changing, and I feel like I’m all alone,"" he sings on ""Lowly Ants"". ""Sometimes I waste my mind, I feel like I’m already dying.""  </p>
<p>Steeped in darkness, Name has carved out his best album yet. Some of <i>Light Show</i>'s more vibrant and maximal tracks (""Do the Shadow"") couldn't stand up to the more spacious songs, the ones that had room for him to linger on a verse for a bit (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16315-jack-name-pure-terror/"">""Pure Terror""</a>). On <i>Weird Moons</i>, he lets himself tease out grooves for a bit longer, and the extra space puts a better spotlight on just how good this guy is at writing hooks. ""Under the Weird Moon"" packs rafter-reaching glam pop while the brooding synths of ""Running After Ganymede"" pulse in the darkness, occasionally mimicking a wolf's howl. He's soulfully ethereal like <i>Station to Station</i> or <i>Low</i>-era Bowie (""Something About Glenn Goins""), and he's crunchy and industrial (""Watcher Talk""). If his voice isn't muffled beneath other instrumentals, it's almost unsettlingly present, like when he coolly asserts ""I like to feel my body changing form"" at the front of the ""Waiting for Another Moon"" mix.</p>
<p>In order to enjoy <i>Light Show</i>, it felt necessary to be invested in the album's story. A lot of the songs were essentially character-establishing scenes in a film, and even though the music was interesting, some songs felt like vehicles for the plot. While there's obviously an arc here, all eight of these songs work when removed from the album's context. His ambition as a songwriter has earned him a spot in the Hall of Pop Eccentrics alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19936-ariel-pink-pom-pom/""><i>P</i><i>om Pom</i></a> featured Name) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29861-connan-mockasin/"">Connan Mockasin</a>, but when you step back from the monsters and implicit darkness, you realize that Jack Name is also very good at writing earworms.</p></div>"|20167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20167-weird-moons/|7.2|Evan Minsker

The Englewood rapper keeps his name in the local headlines </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">with a constant stream of loose tracks whose titles often effectively sum up the snarky, acutely self-aware attitude of his lyrics: ""G File Clerk"", ""A Blog Write-Up"", or ""Loop God"". Though his reputation has grown thanks in part to his collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32308-vic-mensa/"" target=""_blank"">Vic Mensa</a>, and acclaimed ""soultrap"" rapper/producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31352-tree/"" target=""_blank"">Tree</a>, Spencer is a proud free agent who vocally dismisses the noise surrounding his city’s hip-hop landscape and stays committed to—even obsessed with—forging his own path.</span></p>
<p>It's sometimes hard to pinpoint what makes Spencer’s music so distinctive. On his sinister, synth-heavy 2013 full-length, <i>The Rapping Bastard</i> and <a href=""http://www.audiomack.com/album/perpetual-rebel/spence-ethic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previous albums</a>, it's his willingness to tackle unusual production and his unbridled flow, which ignores the beat's fault lines and a clear sense of symmetry. On his new <i>The Cost of Victory</i>, however, Spencer's sense of control, rather than his unpredictability, takes center stage. He successfully recasts familiar styles—sample-heavy gangsta and underground rap idioms from the late '90s—without indulging in anodyne nostalgia, a difficult feat for most contemporary rappers. More than on his previous releases, it feels like Spencer is paying tribute to the music he grew up listening to; on horn-driven opener ""Deadstock"", he remembers ""walk[ing] up and down Lamron/ Rappin’ out loud the lyrics to ‘Confessions’ by Cam’ron,"" and mutters ""They don’t make this kind of shit no more"" throughout the tellingly titled ""Sony Walkman"". But this music is clearly an individualistic <i>response</i> to this source material, not rite-of-passage rehashing.</p>
<p>Above everything else, Spencer is able to carry the project off because these songs are so skillfully and painstakingly written. As always, his verses characterize his bigger-than-life, reliably disagreeable personality, and are propelled by the healthy competitive spirit of a battle rapper or a dozens player (""I play the background but my rhymes live and direct/ I don’t care if that’s your chick, boy, I’m eying the chest""). On every song, the rapper quickly comes out swinging against buzzworthy rap phenoms, ""Internet thugs,"" ""fashion bozos"" or the misspent adolescents of Chicago (""murk[ing] something"" when they can’t even ""spell the name of [his] fucking block""). Spencer’s ability to pivot between incongruous talking points recalls the periodically humorous mood swings of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4883-dj-quik/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Quik</a>, one of his <a href=""http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2014/12/vic-spencer-winning-in-his-own-lane/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">espoused favorites</a>. However, unlike the sleek Comptonite, Spencer's brash delivery is all live-wire assault tactics. The approach is enough to keep the listener’s attention even in the near-complete absence of hooks, and to carry over the album’s busy, heavily sliced-and-diced production.</p>
<p>Building up hip-hop acts gradually—across and despite trends—through pushing cohesive, full-length projects instead of viral singles is largely a foregone conclusion for today’s labels, but Spencer is following this old model on his own.

His story was always more complex than that, though, as we came to understand over six months in 2014, when our rap Romeo went from ""Girl when I’m with you, feel like a champion"" to ""Girl you know you like a pistol, you a throw away."" Things soured for Future and Cici somewhere between the April release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19221-future-honest/""><i>Honest </i></a>and Halloween’s Metro Boomin produced <i>Monster</i>, and the callous nature of his writing post-breakup has given the lie to the Nicholas Sparks perception that’s clouded his major label career. </p>
<p>On <i>Beast Mode</i>, produced in full by Atlanta trap maestro Zaytoven, Future retreats further into the flashy player lifestyle presented on pre-album mixtape highlights <i>Dirty Sprite </i>and <i>True Story</i>. He’s colder than he’s been since 2012’s <i>Astronaut Status</i>’ ""My Ho 2"" on cuts like ""Lay Up"" and ""Peacoat"", bragging on the former about passing a hook-up off ""like a lay up"" and glibly remarking that he ""spent a check on that pussy"" on the latter. At first it seems like a continuation of the aggy sexual and emotional revenge tactics of <i>Monster</i> (see: ""My Savages""’ ""You think I’m sitting up depressed?/ I’m somewhere counting up me a check,"" ""Throw Away""’s ""I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you"") but the deeper you delve into <i>Beast Mode</i>, the more it comes off as the vice grip headache and hangover to <i>Monster</i>’s seedy rager.</p>
<p>At the outset <i>Beast Mode </i>is somewhat mechanical, Future locking into whirring synth arrangements and churning out three-minute nuggets of dopeboy grit. Opener ""Ooooh"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2251-juvenile/"">Juvenile</a> tribute ""Aintchu"", and closer ""Forever Eva"" coolly channel the inherent catchiness of mixtape Future, the half cast off, half accomplished greatness he exuded before he began to write more keenly for mass consumption. But when Zay tosses out something darker he gets it back in kind. You can hear Zaytoven catch Future in the chest at the top of ""No Basic"" as the track billows in and he ad libs, ""You gotta feel the pain of a kid in the ghetto, the heart of the ghetto"" before laying out a list of hard hits he took in getting to the money (""Took all the pain and I ran with it.../ I took a few losses and ran with it""). On ""Just Like Bruddas"", he’s suspended in a daze of Percocet, Xanax, and promethazine self-medication amid a bad press cycle of his own design as his producer dances around a gutting, intricate piano line underfoot.</p>
<p>Future and Zaytoven have collaborated quite a bit in the past but it’s apparent that Zay is bringing something different to the table this time and that it’s bringing something else of Future. Zay’s best works (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"">Gucci Mane</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIS8twlzuMw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bricks""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAqoGePi-bs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Papers""</a>, to name just two) are wonky collisions of trap drums and church organs armed with a fleet musicality that the bullish simplicity of the Lex Lugers and the druggy atmospherics of the Mike WiLLs have often lacked. Recent Zaytoven productions have eased off a measure of the emotionalism of his playing, though, resulting in still great, still quirky winners like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-hq_CHNH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Versace""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32662-shy-glizzy/"">Shy Glizzy</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efTrtxekEZg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Catch a Body""</a> with hooks that grip but don’t much pull. <i>Beast Mode </i>feels heavier, particularly in the stretch from ""No Basic"" to ""Where I Came From"", a succession of dour compositions rendered quietly devastating by Zay’s soulful riffing around the central themes and by Future’s matching reflective malaise. Their deepening chemistry is <i>Beast Mode</i>’s boon.</p>
<p>Jutting outside his hitmaking responsibilities has allowed Future to make music that speaks to a very specific personal turmoil without worrying about whether it’ll be relatable or even likable. The feed-the-charts-feed-the-streets formula of <i>Honest </i>worked as well as it possibly could’ve last year, but lately, Future’s feeding himself, taking inventory of his journey, and learning how to navigate a very public rough patch. The casual sex doesn’t seem fun, the recreational pharmaceutical use feels ominous, and there’s a distinctly mournful air to the proceedings. Though he’ll only tacitly admit as much, our player entrepreneur is hurt, and <i>Beast Mode</i>’s heavy-hearted sounds assist him in sorting through it just as <i>Monster</i>’s menace helped him turn spite to fuel.</p></div>"|20166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20166-future-beast-mode/|7.7|Craig Jenkins

But over the course of six solid-to-great full-lengths, Supergrass were a welcome alternative to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"">witty austerity</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3970-suede/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">sexual malaise</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">idol worship</a> that came to define the movement. Around the time of the 2004 singles collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7626-supergrass-is-10/""><i>Supergrass Is 10</i></a>, it became clear that Supergrass were born to play Cult Favorite. From the whirligigging Ritalin rush of their U.S. breakthrough <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUE4oDunYkc"" rel=""nofollow"">""Alright""</a> to the rip-snorting grunge-pop of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnXrrOxzZCE"" rel=""nofollow"">""Richard III""</a> and on through the retro-futurism of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08cnRXjmpPQ"" rel=""nofollow"">""Rush Hour Soul""</a>, Supergrass reminded people how much fucking <i>fun</i> being in a rock band could be. Still, Coombes’ post-Supergrass output has been prone to the usual trappings. There was the HotRats’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13817-turn-ons/""><i>Turn Ons</i></a>, a one-off covers collection that found Coombes and Supergrass bandmate Danny Goffey tackling such on-the-nose favorites as ""Love Is the Drug"" and ""Queen Bitch"" (and, uh, ""Fight for Your Right (to Party)""); an obligatory <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVkVUJ3HaLA"" rel=""nofollow"">car commercial</a>; his 2012 debut solo affair <i>Here Come the Bombs</i>. Now with <i>Matador</i>, Coombes takes the road more traveled, offering 11 new tunes that retain familiar glimmers of mischief but try to appeal to a more mature sensibility.</p>
<p>Coombes still sounds eager, and Supergrass' sense of restlessness continues here: <i>Matador</i> suggests a guy constantly on the move, exorcising as much as from his brain as he can before scurrying on over to the next thing. But where Coombes was once a conscientious self-editor, keeping things as lean and catchy as possible, here he tends to overwork ideas. Take ""Detroit"", which is fairly representative of the album on the whole: What starts out as a wonderfully introspective, acoustic track built for daydreaming gives way to overblown bursts of string-augmented gospel. <i>Matador</i> is constantly being pulled in different directions. Had he resigned himself to taking a looser, more natural approach (which did <i>Bombs</i> a favor or two), or gone all-the-way with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"">Albarn</a>-esque pageantry, we might be talking about a more interesting record.</p>
<p>Fans will no doubt try to engage with <i>Matador</i> as a Supergrass album, which is unfair. But when it seems content to play as merely a Supergrass footnote, it’s hard not to make easy comparisons. A few tracks make some effort to remedy that kind of thinking, all while appeasing longtime loyalists. ""The English Ruse"" is one of the better songs here, its looping, <a href=""http://www.peanuts.com/characters/schroeder/#.VMJwjVo-A1g"" rel=""nofollow"">Schroeder</a>-indebted keyboards primed to score another wacky sped-up music video (fun fact: <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2008/06/supergrasss_gaz_coombes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Steven Spielberg once approached Supergrass</a> to do a Monkees-inspired TV show), but this time with a strong undercurrent of paranoia. ""Needle's Eye"", which ultimately suffers from overcrowding, has a louche touch reminiscent of the B-movie glam of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7624-life-on-other-planets/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Life on Other Planets</i></a>. The cautious creep of single <a href=""http://www.undertheradarmag.com/news/listen_gaz_coombes_-_20_20"" rel=""nofollow"">""20/20""</a>, which nicely exemplifies <i>Matador</i>’s crisp production values, helps balance its lucid moments of euphoria by blending in uneasier elements along the way. Coombes comes at these songs with a less-is-more attitude, but even the simplest fare fails to connect. The Manic Pixel Dream Girl fantasy ""The Girl Who Fell to Earth"", which finds Coombes ""blinded by computer love,"" is a snoozer that predicts a good portion of <i>Matador</i>’s back end. ""Oscillate"" is stoner music that plays like a parody of stoner music, while the reflective ""Seven Walls"" and the understated title track are just <i>there</i>. Instead of following his darker impulses or fantastically out-there indulgences, Coombes plays it safe.</p></div>"|20160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20160-matador/|6.3|Zach Kelly

In a fantastically frantic old-coot voice, they shout ""Keep that turtle out of my cabbage patch"" and ""That sure is a funny picture of your mother and me"".</p>
<p>Naturally, these bands weren't reinventing the wheel.

It sounded as though a hardcore band got locked in their rehearsal space with only their gear, Obituary's <i>Cause of Death</i>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32287-crowbar"">Crowbar</a>'s <i>Broken Glass</i> to pass the time. <i>Muerte</i> was less cerebral than death metal, meaner than sludge, and unsubtly knuckle-dragging and proud of it. Beneath Xibalba's ultra-tough exterior was a desire to advance their sound, even by adding armor to their older vessels. ""Cold"", which started out on a split with World of Pain and Ruckus as a chugging mosh song, became a hulking riff mass with Greg Anderson's guidance and additional guitars. The band emerges as an even more confident war machine with <i>Tierra Y Libertad</i>, streamlining their sound, cranking the tempos, and tipping the balance towards death metal. If <i>Muerte</i> was the beginning of the workout process, <i>Libertad</i> is where they come out swole as hell.</p>
<p>Where does this newfound vigor come from? Xibalba have clearly been studying the British death metal band Bolt Thrower's move from grind to death, and unlike crusties who lean towards metal, not just their rawer 1988 debut <i>In Battle There Is No Law!</i> Many of the album's faster moments sound not unlike 1991's grind-ditching <i>War Master</i>, and Xibalba's development mimics Bolt Thrower's on that as a whole. ""Enemigo"" establishes the album's direction promptly and with no mercy; that chug is undeniable. Most of the record is carried out with similar intent; the confidence in their playing cannot be overlooked. It's not just that they add more solos, it's that they've found a way to advance beyond listing their influences. Xibalba's penchant for groove is still evident even though their dances have become quicker and deadlier, which is primarily why these songs carry. ""Invierno"" has bounce for days, the closest death metal can get to being funky. The ending riff of ""Si Dios Quiere"" is just disjointed enough to sound a bit hazy, but still packs that hardcore punch, making for a beatdown whose impact you'll remember better than the conflict that set it off. It's hard to believe that Xibalba were the same band that made <i>Madre Mia Gracias Por Los Dias</i>, their 2010 debut whose production sounds downright anemic compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31035-nails/"">Nails</a> drummer Taylor Young's work on <i>Libertad</i>.</p>
<p><i>Muerte</i> was primarily conceived for rough-housing, and few modern hardcore records serve that purpose better, but Xibalba also gave into a bit of experimentation. Some ideas worked better than others—the female vocals on ""Mala Mujer"" gave a new dimension to <i>Muerte</i>'s agony, but instrumental piece ""The Flood"" was plodding along in search of a breakdown. <i>Libertad</i>'s instrumental piece, ""Pausa"", is much shorter and serves primarily as a lead-in for ""En Paz Descanse"". Xibalba's restraint in this aspect pays off, as the focus stays on the death metal muscle. They only really extend themselves on <i>Libertad</i>'s closer, ""El Vacio"". A lot of the sludge influence comes back on this song; most of it sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"">Pallbearer</a> going back to basics, with dreary cleans and especially deep, longing vocals that could be on the next Skepticism record.</p>
<p>""Vacio"" is Xibalba at their most alienated, and while they've never been more sure of themselves musically, there's hints throughout that they really want to shake up and challenge their audience. Most of the record looks inward, but ""Guerilla"" speaks of violent revolution with no uncertain terms. Vocalist Nate Rebolledo's call for unity against oppressors isn't a whisper: ""I'm not a spick, a nigger, a cracker/...I am the pissed off human race/ We are here to scream 'fuck you!'"" His vocals are the most obvious remnant of Xibalba's hardcore days, and they're needed for a direct proclamation such as this. And it's just the thing fans of hardcore, death metal, and, really, any form of heavy music need to hear more of.</p>
<p>Hardcore waxes on and on about brotherhood and sticking together, and isn't opposed to using violent metaphors to express such sentiments, but Rebolledo is speaking on a grander scale than bros looking out for bros. That may be harder to take than an accidental punch in the face at one of their shows. Some punk kid may cry ""ACAB"" because he got written up for open containers, but there are many who don't get off that lightly. Dan Seagrave's artwork for <i>Libertad</i> is another one of his classic dystopian war scenes, but Xibalba's war is not literal: it's about what your expectations of them might be, it's about pushing the limits of hardcore, it's about combating apathy. Helps when you've got sick riffs on your side.</p></div>"|20126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20126-tierra-y-libertad/|7.6|Andy O'Connor

During these five tracks, electric guitars splash swatches of neon sound between a rhythm section built from athletic handclaps. Multi-tracked saxophones spiral in perfect antiphony with static-and-hiss electronics. Drums move back and forth between a sustained roll and a snapping march with inhuman stamina. You imagine the musicians not only playing these parts but—brows furrowed behind a mixing board, eyes glazed in front of a computer’s glow—putting the pieces in their proper places, creating a meticulous whole from many unwieldy segments. How else could three people so perfectly toe the lines between free-jazz bedlam and near-classical precision, between sound-art abstraction and math-rock execution, all while making the intertwining instrumentals somehow bright and accessible, too? This stuff seems too complicated to be only played.</p>
<p>It is, however, just one miracle of <i>Xe, </i>the first proper album by Zs’ new trio configuration,<a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2015/01/10/avant-rock-trio-brings-its-latest-incarnation-jamaica-plain/EuHHIjLb3OgPPgfIbvOGmK/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> </i>that these five tracks stem from real-time, single takes</a>. There was little-to-no editing or post-production, or no overdubs to shore up the squawk of Sam Hillmer’s saxophone or the ricochet of Patrick Higgins’ guitar. Years and lineups ago, Zs worked from complete scores, toting sheet music into rock-club contexts. On 2013’s two-sided <i>Grain</i>, the new trio split into dual factions, each remixing recordings from earlier Zs incarnations into 21-minute epics. The rendering by new drummer Greg Fox, best known for his work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"">Liturgy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30534-guardian-alien/"">Guardian Alien</a>, was a surrealistic reimagining of the old band’s strict order. You can picture <i>Xe </i>being built by either process, really—read from a chart by a well-rehearsed troupe or built on screen by people with as much patience as programming acumen. But no, <i>Xe</i> was created live in a room, using only loose sketches and structures as signposts.</p>
<p>Thanks to that setup, Zs demonstrate an energy and urgency here that they’ve never before had, as these pieces leap off the page in exhilarating fashion. The tantric title track bursts into heavy paroxysms, like a metal band launching into a snippet of Albert Ayler’s ""Holy Ghost"". Opener ""The Future of Royalty"" is, at first, pneumatically precise, with several sets of rhythms stacked against taut guitar and reed lines. But it’s most electrifying when they leave the plan and rip into a cacophonous crescendo, the band locked in a three-way battle for air.</p>
<p>Still, Zs take no breaks or breaths during these 42 minutes, with each number seguing into the next. That decision ferries momentum between the tracks. What’s more important, though, to the record’s compulsory flow is how Zs turn arrays of influences and ideas into uninterrupted, seamless streams. Fox, Higgins, and Hillmer share the ability to take disparate, treasured sources, disassemble them into essential components, and spontaneously build something singular and distinct from them all. That rush of touchstones—and the surprising, uncanny ways Zs find to fit them together—give <i>Xe</i> much of its magnetism. The plucky guitar line that anchors ""Corps"", for instance, echoes the sounds of various West African traditions, while Hillmer’s slinking-and-crying saxophone work nods to Pharoah Sanders’ languid lines and the pointillist landmarks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>. Fox moves between a steady thump that proclaims he’s keeping time for a band of German legends and tense drum rolls that indicate he wants to do little more than disrupt the meter. ""Wolf Government"", meanwhile, interposes aleatoric electronics that suggest the recorded murmurs of short circuits with a mutated hair metal guitar solo, as if played by Sammy Hagar on speed <i>and</i> acid. At best, this configuration of Zs finds ways to soften the edges of discrete and disconnected ideas, pushing them into a space where the listener can fit, too.</p>
<p>Despite rightful talk of increasingly permissive genre borders and the sometimes-narrowing gaps between what is perceived as the aboveground and the underground, the distances between experimental, academic and more popularly accepted realms can still be vast. But <i>Xe</i> delights in such rifts. This trio leavens the abstruse with the excitable, pairs the improvised and wild with the calculated and controlled. Despite its slide into full-on roar, ""The Future of Royalty"" is irrepressible, with a combination of riff and rhythm that recalls the success of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3638-ratatat/"">Ratatat</a>. And in the hands of the right mixer, the steady percolation, sudden eruptions and seesaw theme of the self-titled grand finale could offer endless dancefloor steam. It’s music to freak out to, yes, but that promise isn’t necessarily limited to the freaks of free-jazz or art-rock enclaves. From the all-in-one-room way it was made to the forceful assimilation of so many sounds that Zs’ members just seem to like, there’s a human quality to <i>Xe</i>. If at first you can’t picture it, you’ll soon hear it just the same.</p></div>"|20090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20090-xe/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

As modern rock tales ought to go, it was one of the San Francisco garage scene's leading local weirdos, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Presley</a>, who saved her from relative obscurity. Though Pratt was born in Redding, Calif., her poised, homespun folk songs feel beamed from another time and place, specifically hippie-era Britain; as a teenager, Pratt says, she honed her craft by playing along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"">T. Rex</a>'s <i>Electric Warrior </i>glam riffs and singing early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1442-marianne-faithfull/"">Marianne Faithfull</a> melodies. When Presley stumbled upon a batch of her recordings from 2007, he allegedly dumped his life's savings into releasing them as her 2012 debut. And yet, it took something more for Pratt's spirit to truly be found.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Pratt's gorgeous <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a> debut quietly rejects tradition. For all its folk touchstones, Pratt is more an aesthete than a poet—she sings of bleeding watercolors, blue geraniums—and accordingly <i>On Your Own Love Again</i> plays like acoustic dream-pop. Its warm, home-recorded atmosphere is more dramatic and distinctive than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17415-jessica-pratt/""><i>Jessica Pratt</i></a>: finger-picked psychedelia, lucidly layered harmonies, hissy tape effects, an overcast haze. But Pratt's songwriting is more cohesive and concise, her whispered secrets more alluring. The record's cyclical nature gives <i>On Your Own</i> more momentum, as she sings sticky rock'n'roll hooks learned from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1966-the-hollies/"">the Hollies</a>. (Pratt says she listened to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8485-van-dyke-parks/"">Van Dyke Parks</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16765-song-cycle-discover-america-clang-of-the-yankee-reaper/""><i>Song Cycle</i></a> while at work on the album, like her Drag City labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"">Joanna Newsom</a> did when making <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9616-ys/""><i>Ys</i></a>). Her soprano is hard to pin in a folk context—it variously recalls the high-pitched eccentricities of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a>, the grave depth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>—but she ultimately sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"">Vashti Bunyan</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a> as found in the sleepy subconscious of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>. ""Sometimes I pray for the rain,"" Pratt repeats near the end of this wintry album, which feels designed to soundtrack the slow-falling snow or any steadied act of nature.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Much of what Pratt communicates is abstract, elliptical, or wordless. Sometimes her crystalline guitar strum sounds like a harp, each note falling quick and elegant like one of said snowflakes; sometimes the songs melt. On the astral ""Moon Dude"", Pratt makes chord changes evocative as neo-psych time-travel, like Tim Presley's own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"">White Fence</a> project. <i>On Your Own Love Again</i> was made in sunny West Coast terrain, but it captures the somber shades of isolated urban life. Pratt worked on the record in the wake of several difficult endings: a move from San Francisco to L.A., the end of a longterm relationship, and the death of her mother. Occasionally, it sounds like Pratt is plaintively, playfully singing stoned ""da-da-da"" tunes just to drown out the sorrow or numb the chaos. On ""Game That I Play"", for one, she imbues, ""I often try to leave my thoughts of you behind,"" but her wish is left hanging; there is no resolve. And on ""Jacquelyn in the Background"", Pratt similarly drifts, struggling for the right words: ""Deep inside my lonely room/ I cry the tears of never knowing you,"" she sings before a stream of vocalizations. <i>On Your Own Love Again</i> has more earnest moments, but its unadorned emotional uncertainty is profound and relatable.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Elsewhere, Pratt's austere meditations conjure confusion, wrongness, illusive realities. She sings of lonely outsiders and starry-eyed boys she wants to love but audibly cannot. Pratt understands her own flaws and so seems to better understand those of others; it's humanizing. She might call out a guy's disloyal tricks and lies, but she also points to her own: ""I don't wanna be changing the game that I play,"" Pratt sings early on, ""But I see that you're leaving, so what can I say."" She doesn't airbrush her faults. The title track, a 95-second epilogue, appears last on the record, and it's the album's most confessional song—""I try to believe in you somehow/ But every time I do I get down and out""—as if, after working through her clouded thoughts, she's emerged from the fog to think clearly. The ""love"" in <i>On Your Own Love Again</i> could be a noun, pointing outward, or a verb, pointing in, but it regardless has a way of romanticizing aloneness, as the album does throughout in more impressionistic terms.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But there is a vessel to that clear-headed solitude: ""Back, Baby"" is the record's penultimate track, the brightened moment at which everything becomes focused, giving physicality to the record's wandering spirit. One would expect ""Back, Baby"" to come at the end of a film as the credits roll—closure at the end of an ill-fated romance. There is an understated power to it, not just because Pratt is cutting off a person who no longer serves her, but because she is staring at the open space to become someone new. Fifty years after Dylan sang pop's greatest <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ca7xMkWZuc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""don't look back"" moment</a>, Jessica Pratt offers an even more emphatic ""<i>can't</i> go back,"" but she belongs to no one. <i>On Your Own Love Again </i>spends its 31 minutes in dialogue with the past, but it plays in perpetual motion forward. As with all break-ups, its end is a beginning.</p></div>"|20130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20130-jessica-pratt-on-your-own-love-again/|8.1|Jenn Pelly

From the outset, they’ve named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean"">the Clean</a>’s ""Anything Could Happen"" as their gold standard and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">the Go-Betweens</a> as a formative influence, saving everyone the time it would otherwise take to come up with the proper comparisons. In the past, they’ve dabbled in exploratory instrumentals, ballads, and spoken-word, and all came off as temporary distractions from the things they do best. Which is perhaps why they stick with what got them here on their <a href=""http://www.mergerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merge</a> debut and decided to call the album <i>Range Anxiety</i>. But as opposed to a concession, their focus is a sign of artistic progress.</p>
<p>And so the most genuinely surprising moment on <i>Range Anxiety</i> might be its <i>only</i> surprising moment: it arrives when Martin Frawley describes his object of affection on ""Love at First Sight"": she’s a Peruvian DJ wearing Louis Vuitton heels, and she has a boyfriend. It’s a one-way attraction of opposites, because she’s everything Frawley isn’t within the context of Twerps: a multi-tasker, a socialite, fashion-conscious and ostensibly in a happy relationship.</p>
<p>That neither Frawley nor co-vocalist Julia Macfarlane have their shit together is hardly to their detriment. So there’s a distinct comic element during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17173-the-twerps-back-to-you/"">""Back to You""</a> when Frawley expresses envy at someone out there sipping iced tea and living free. At no point does Frawley seem bothered by any pressing obligation, but his foil does not share the constant incapacitation as a result of the girl who keeps walking out of his life. ""It all keeps coming back to you,"" Frawley sings on a chorus that could pass for the main sentiment on over half of <i>Range Anxiety</i> and one that finds a comfort in the predictability of despair<span>—</span>it’s a toast of the one beer that becomes the ""one too many.""</p>
<p>Still, <i>Range Anxiety</i> goes by in an instant, makes minimal demands, and is remarkably enjoyable for its simple pleasures. It may not have the heft to <i>move</i> you, but it’s gentle and never unwelcome. Classic jangle-rock hooks lodge in your head without taking up much space. The lyrics are simple expressions of feelings and there is a song called ""Simple Feelings"". The bulk of the record consists of post-breakup laments delivered with an insouciance that can be confused with cheer; they could just as easily find themselves on a mix prepared for a future crush.</p>
<p>It all comes so naturally to Twerps that <i>Range Anxiety</i> could be considered effortless as a pejorative, which is why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17265-the-twerps-i-dont-mind/"">“I Don’t Mind”</a> is not only their best song to date, but also their most important. As the first proper track on <i>Range Anxiety</i> and one of two tracks over five minutes, it towers over the proceedings. It's a committed and extroverted song about not caring about the outside world, one that evokes big bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"">U2</a>, a song that simmers rather than pops and fizzes, that plays Frawley and Macfarlane’s voices for contrast when they otherwise conspire to share the same shrugging views on social demands.</p>
<p><i>Range Anxiety</i> could use more of the emotional ballast provided by ""I Don't Mind"", even if it doesn’t necessarily need it. Some will hear the album as perfectly breezy, others might consider it featherweight. But this isn’t entirely the fault of Twerps—they just don’t have much of a desire to present their music as autobiography. Hook-for-hook and chime-for-chime, it matches up with the most recent work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"">Real Estate</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco"">Mac DeMarco</a>, 2014’s kings of college quad indie. But while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19060-real-estate-atlas/""><i>Atlas</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19170-mac-demarco-salad-days/""><i>Salad Days</i></a> made a point to stress their reckoning with parenthood, aging, the demands of art and other <i>adult</i> topics, Twerps all but admit <i>Range Anxiety</i> was inspired by a rock'n'roll, on-the-dole lifestyle that leaves vast gaps for drinking and alone time. Which is what a lot of people grappling with family and work pine for anyway, and the predictability and reliability of <i>Range Anxiety</i> just means it's always there when you need it.</p></div>"|20140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20140-range-anxiety/|7.5|Ian Cohen

In 2014, the British producer dipped back into the genre by reactivating an EP series he started in the mid-'90s, of which </span><i>Part 8</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is supposedly the final entry. (Like most things Herbert, his words probably shouldn’t be trusted, marking this as neither an end or a beginning). It’s art, put out into the world, given a life that either makes total sense or is mildly baffling, depending on your vantage point. Digging beyond the straight lines of the house workouts spread over these four tracks may not lead to much insight into what Herbert’s trying to do conceptually, but it’s clear he still retains a skill and fondness for the style—it’s all there in the immaculately sheared beats, the waxy synth lines, the tastefully worked samples, the exquisite way he has for working with vocalists.</span></p>
<p>Herbert’s name might not be as prominent as it once was, perhaps due to the deluge of wildly differing music he releases into the world. But he often crops up, sometimes in unexpected places: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9582-the-invisible-woman-a-conversation-with-bjork/"">talked</a> of his value as a collaborator recently, the London Sinfonietta extended an invitation for him to work with them in 2010, and his work as Creative Director of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop has led him into unexplored pastures. It makes sense that Herbert can connect to so many disparate sources—his ability to diversify within his own musical range is largely unparalleled. <i>Part 7</i> of this series touched on a contemporary feeling, via the <a href=""http://pcmusic.info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PC Music</a> referencing <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/accidentalrecords-1/01-herbert-bumps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bumps""</a>, but for <i>Part 8</i> he’s taken a straighter path, working in allusions to skittish pop (""The Wrong Place"") and even going the full torch song route (""Remember Ken"").</p>
<p>If there is a single element that binds Herbert’s recordings, it’s in his ability to metaphorically tie his feet together to prevent himself ending up in the space where he seems to be heading. So ""The Wrong Place"" lands somewhere far heavier than its lighter beginnings, with a pile of digital interference swamping the track in a blocky, malfunctioning tone. ""Ticket"" falls just the right side of irritating, using the mind-numbing repetition of its title in a manner close to the novelty gabber hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqD1OohY2to"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Poing""</a> by Rotterdam Termination Source, but with Herbert upping the mania by driving it to a point that’s simultaneously fascinating and mind-bending. He’s having fun here, clearly, although it often feels like he’s lost in conversation with himself, not digging deep enough into one of house/techno’s most powerful properties—the ability to connect with an audience—especially in the overly earnest ""Her Face"".</p>
<p>The highlights of recent installments in Herbert’s <i>Parts</i> series have mostly come through his work with vocalists, and <i>Part 8</i> is no exception. ""Remember Ken"" draws a soulful vocal out of Ade Omotayo (who has worked with both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28205-kindness/"">Kindness</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/"">Amy Winehouse</a>) and matches it to strings and handclaps that sound so plastic it’s like hearing a demo of the cheapest Casio keyboard ever unleashed on the market. It hits on something Herbert always does so well, where he finds a natural join between earthly and fabricated sources, creating space for the most artificial of pop gestures and a sort of rootsy authenticity. Taking beautifully climbing vocal passages and matching them to instrumentation that, while skillfully played, sounds like it cost about 50 cents from a local junk store—t<span>hese are things that make a charming kind of sense in his world.</span></p></div>"|20159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20159-part-8-ep/|6.4|Nick Neyland

Fed by the cesspools of unrest and corruption in the world, their inspiration flares up and runs wild, feeding off whatever styles are at the ready. Sometimes their visceral sound skews hardcore punk, and sometimes it's more death-metal influenced. On any given record, the approach largely depends on how they approach their muses—the scum of the earth—and fortunately for their fans, there's plenty of scum to be found in today's state of affairs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite some early instability in their ranks—particularly between when they got their start in 1981 and 1992’s landmark album <i>Utopia Banished—</i>and the continued procession of new bands on the block,<i> </i>Napalm Death haven’t relented one bit. If anything, their path of destruction has grown ever wider, fueled, as always, by the grotesque workings of the musical and political communities that surround them, drawn increasingly closer together by the mores of the digital age. The band's most recent effort, 2012’s <i>Utilitarian, </i>ripped apart these themes at length, and longtime vocalist Barney Greenway and company’s new album <i>Apex Predator - Easy Meat </i>is similarly strident in its determination to keep the listening experience kinetically satisfying and altogether disgusting.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Three decades in, Napalm Death’s famously mercurial lineup has solidified into a concise unit: guitarist Mitch Harris, bassist (and longest tenured member) Shane Embury, drummer Danny Herrera, and that maniacal frontman Mark ""Barney"" Greenway. Embury and Herrera are the whiplash-inducing back end, hammering out tempos atop which Harris proudly stands and slashes, bolstering his dissonant chords with high-register yelps and screeches. <span style=""line-height: 24px;"">And, even at 45, Greenway's role as vocal juggernaut remains secure as he continues to gleefully shove aside whatever structures his bandmates assemble in his path. On <i>Apex Predator</i>, <span>Russ Russell’s mixing allows you to catch every strain, every gasp, every last drop of spit. From the way Greenway huffs and puffs on ""</span>How the Years Condemn"", you’d think the guy was the Big Bad Wolf’s cousin from a nuclear dystopia. A closer look at Embury's lyrics reveals instead an ordinary man, haunted by the friends he's lost and desperate to better his life so as not to sully their memory. Napalm Death's splatterhouse hijinks are rooted in a more profound sense of psychological pain this time around, and that their ability to convey that pain hinges largely on its voice.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">What’s more, he remains capable of embodying a dizzying number of roles, adopting the cadence of a murderous carnival barker one moment (on ""Smash a Single Digit"" and ""Metaphorically Screw You"") and an unholy clergy member the next (the title track, an almost meditational nod to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>). Don’t come into this thing expecting a solo spree; aside from John ""Bilbo"" Cook’s delicious guest riff on ""Hierarchies"" (touted humorously in the liner notes as the ""token guitar solo""), the axework on </span><i>Apex Predator - Easy Meat </i><span style=""line-height: 24px;"">skews workmanlike, with Harris welding together hardcore punk, chaotic, hyper-speed grindcore, and just a hint of groove metal to make the acrid medicine go down smoother.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Way back in the mothball-scented archives of YouTube there’s this old TV interview with Jim Carrey in which he half-seriously declares his allegiance to thrash metal, launching into an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9rdQdz7WRA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">impassioned parody of Napalm Death</a>. ""Some day, this guy’s gonna wanna slow down and do some duets,"" he grins, launching into a simulation of what that might sound like. What's crazy is that Carrey's mockery ended up being half fulfilled. On <i>Apex Predator</i>, Napalm Death <i>have </i>scaled back the mach-speed sections of yore, specifically with regards to the drums, and the album<i> does </i>feature a screamed duet of sorts with the shattered dialogue of ""Beyond the Pale"". What’s more, as on 2012's <i>Utilitarian</i> and in other scattered corners of their discography, there are periods of clean singing that would've seemed unthinkable back in the days of <i>Harmony Corruption</i>. Here, it's more interestingly interwoven than in the past. And it’s still a Napalm Death record through and through—which means shredded eardrums and tinnitus for days. After all this time, we’d expect nothing less.</p></div>"|20116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20116-apex-predator-easy-meat/|7.9|Zoe Camp

It's all there, right in front of you; to take it in requires only attention and an open mind. That might sound counterintuitive, given the record's actual backstory: It stems from an electronic opera written and performed by St. Werner, with a libretto by Markus Popp, better known as the glitch pioneer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3187-oval/"">Oval</a>. St. Werner, Popp, and their collaborators—including, here, Dylan Carlson, of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>; Kathy Alberici, aka Bocca al Lupo, and a member of the psychedelic doom group Drum Eyes; and Taigen Kawabe, of psychedelic punks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32463-bo-ningen/"">Bo Ningen</a>—have also fashioned a radio play out of the same material. Could anything sound <i>more </i>like it required homework?</p>
<p>But knowing much of anything about St. Werner's work in Mouse on Mars is neither help nor hindrance here; <i>Miscontinuum Album</i> is so far from that duo's already enormously varied terrain that the main bullet point on his résumé scarcely bears mentioning. Nor do you need to be familiar with Lithops, the alias for a number of St. Werner's solo electronic releases between 1996 and 2010. Sonically, the shimmering, electroacoustic drones here share more in common with St. Werner's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18112-jan-st-werner-blaze-colour-burn/""><i>Blaze Colour Burn</i></a>, from 2013, the first release in his Fiepblatter Series. (This is the third in that series.) Ultimately, though, <i>Miscontinuum Album </i>feels less like a <i>project</i>, or even an album, than a garden or a warren of streets or an abandoned building—something you stumble upon, enter, and explore at your own pace.</p>
<p>Time—or, more accurately, the experience of time—is its primary subject. The musical portions of the album thrum with buzzing synthesizers and naked oscillations—extended passages of unsteady repetitions, rippling loops, and long, held tones that twist like moebius strips. The sound shimmers; heavy on organ-like sounds and trilling electronic frequencies, it scans as a cross between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1688-gastr-del-sol/"">Gastr Del Sol</a>. Several tracks are quite long, running to 12, 16, and even 25 minutes. The music moves like snowmelt in the process of becoming a river, trickling and rushing without obvious shape or direction. The background is awash in voices: pellucid soprano, insectoid chatter, time-stretched shrieks, and the ragged cries of black metal, all blown out into a chalky blur of breath and spittle.</p>
<p>But the album's real center of gravity is to be found in the libretto's five text passages, each between two and three minutes long, read by Earth's Dylan Carlson. The text is plainspoken and prosaic, until it's not; it has the habit of ducking and feinting, hiding behind its own shadow, cloaked in ambiguity. ""We hear footsteps above us,"" says Carlson in the introductory track. ""But we're already on the roof. Each <i>now</i> lasts only for a moment. It's all just memory. Holding firm, forget, search for home. Something somewhere, in us, lives on, as—spirit?"" These words don't do much on the page, but the way he speaks them makes them come alive—as riddle, or incantation, or blindfolded expressway to yr skull.</p>
<p>Carlson's voice is strangely hypnotic. ""How am I not myself?"" he asks, early in the piece, describing a continuous tone as a buzz rises in the background behind him and then falls silent. ""It cuts to the heart,"" he continues, his voice at once monotone and strangely tender. ""This loneliness after silence. This siren is older than hunger. The loneliness is now electronic. The sound has always been there. It is the undead in me."" There is a tiny rustle of noise in the background, and you lean towards the speakers, acutely aware of the act of listening.</p>
<p><i>Miscontinuum Album</i> is not meant to be background music. It was also not made to be experienced on YouTube or the free version of Spotify, where an ill-timed advertisement would break the music's spell. It doesn't require your full attention, but it tends to capture it. I like to imagine what it would feel like to stumble across the piece on the radio, late at night, perhaps in your car, having no idea what you were hearing, or why—being drawn into its web, confused and intoxicated. After Carlson has finished his monologue, there is a long, enveloping finale, ""Amazonas""—25 minutes of shimmer and thrum, hiccup and sigh. It is a sort of psychedelic aftershock to the sober meditations that have come before, and it feels like an answer to a question that Carlson asks in ""Scene 2"": ""Why always the need to explain everything, and from every angle? Everything so endlessly questioned, understood, disassembled, until one wants to do more—but no longer can."" To <i>do more</i>, in the context of <i>Miscontinuum Album</i>, is simply to listen. It is more than enough; it is the be-all and end-all.</p></div>"|20071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20071-miscontinuum-album/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

After returning last year from more than a decade of light activity, Richard D. James is back with his second Aphex Twin record in four months. If <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/"">Syro</a></i> was a masterful summation of the sound James pioneered on his classic 1990s releases, <i>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</i> is a reminder that there was always a lot of low-profile experimentation going on alongside the canonical LPs. Rather than cobble together <i>Syro</i> leftovers (it’s fair to assume there are many of these), James draws from a different aesthetic altogether. It’s all there in the title: whatever the process for actually assembling these tracks, the individual sounds do indeed seem to be physical objects vibrating in space, as if James had marshaled a battalion of robots to realize his latest compositions.</p>
<p>Texturally, the music bears some similarity to bits found on <i>Drukqs</i>, specifically the prepared piano tracks that contrasted with that album's more frenetic breakbeat excursions. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcFsD8Pn3qw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jynweythek Ylow""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMFb1aMhD3U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Strotha Tynhe""</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0vu-W0CvFs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Penty Harmomium""</a> are clear antecedents to the music found here, but <i>Acoustic Instruments</i> takes those ideas further. Piano, prepared and otherwise, features heavily, but so do various drums and wood and metal percussion instruments. And where James used to offer his electro-acoustic pieces as a showcase for lyrical melodies, about half the music here consists of crisply arranged beats, with loping drum lines that occasionally veer toward funk.</p>
<p>The most striking thing about <i>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</i> (the title is a typical James puzzle—no word of where Pt 1 may be) is how directly his musical concerns can be mapped on to another context. The grooves, the de-tuned melodies, the bridges, the way rhythms can lag a split second behind the beat—all are signatures of his electronic work and all are found here intact. A good point of comparison demonstrating how difficult this must be is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/481-acoustica/""><i>Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound Performs Aphex Twin</i></a>, an album from a decade ago that found the new music ensemble tackling some of James’ better-known compositions. The skeleton of tunes like ""4"" and ""Meltphace 6"" was there, but the sense of movement was way off. Here, we can hear the person and the sensibility behind the sounds.</p>
<p>On some tracks, you can almost hear their electronic counterparts. ""diskhat1"" features clipped drums with a steady hi-hat and a prepared piano riff that sounds dissonant to the point of seeming alien. ""hat5c 0001 rec–4"" is constructed with similar tools but uses a piano motif from the bass clef to give it the anxious feel of a tightly-sequenced synth. ""piano un10 it happened"" can be filed with James’ most delicate and beautiful pieces, one of those effortless melodies that vanishes into the air right around the time you start thinking about the <a href=""http://windhaming.com/windham-hill-discography-100/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Windham Hill catalog</a>. Indeed, brevity is key: <i>Acoustic Instruments</i> is the perfect length—28 minutes long, 13 tracks, with about half fully fleshed out and the others serving as sketches—for this sort of treatment. James has a handful of ideas, he comes in and executes them perfectly, and then he gets out.</p>
<p>If <i>Syro</i> was a re-introduction for James, a way to put his music in front of people who didn’t know or follow along with his earlier work, <i>Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2</i> is a release for established fans, people who want to know what his pieces would sound like in an altogether different setting. So while the EP feels like it can be connected to other music (it’s easy to draw lines to gamelan music and kinetic film scores), the greatest pleasure comes in knowing where it came from and how it came to be. It’s an Aphex Twin EP more than just an EP, and as those go it’s very good.</p></div>"|20156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20156-computer-controlled-acoustic-instruments-pt2-ep/|8.3|Mark Richardson

Anything much more than that—left-field lyricism, hooks that sink their claws into you, a collection of beats that cohere into some loose future-is-now synthesis of electronic hip-hop—is a bonus, if an expected one. They fly banners in defiance of hierarchies: </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16043-doomtree-no-kings/"" target=""_blank""><i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">No Kings</span></i></a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> embodied that ""the biggest thing we rule is ourselves"" ethos, where calls to get on their level meant promises of camaraderie more than challenges for competition. And yet they pull weight when they make those calls to arms omnidirectional, ricocheting off each member and filling the room with all these different levels of signal-obscuring noise that make even the matter-of-fact stuff feel enigmatic.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In other words, it's kind of an inner-circle sort of approach, no matter how big that circle's designed to get. A big-in-Minnesota cult act that's taken both local roots and global possibilities to heart, Doomtree's hard-earned success has built-in safeguards against complacency and predictability. For one thing, the youth-movement energy in their music remains even as their early thirties are settling in; last December's tenth annual weeklong Twin Cities-wide ""Doomtree Blowout"" was declared their last not out of encroaching middle-age burnout but because ""we got to thinking about how incredibly lame and boring the idea of ever throwing a Blowout 11 sounded."" And their new album </span><span><i>All Hands</i> </span><span>bears out some of that urge to hit a reset button that doubles as a fast-forward.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Written in a cabin with dicey-at-best cellular reception, </span><i>All Hands </i><span>feels cut off from most of the world outside their own universe. It's a blessing and a curse keeping a collaborative relationship between seven different artists—with five of them being MCs, and two of those MCs contributing beats alongside their two regular producers, it's both kind of amazing and really understandable how they've all been able to both maintain and move ahead without imploding after more than a decade. The complementary pieces are all keystones here, and stylistic variety—the focused punk-vibe grit-and-grind of P.O.S., Dessa's smooth venom, Cecil Otter reining in agitation, Sims and Mike Mictlan rounding out the rewind-demanding punchline barrage—is what keeps the album alive even when the words start to blur.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Which they do, often. You can pick out the mood-setting references if you want: ""Final Boss"" has Sims paraphrasing </span><i>The Karate Kid </i><span>and finding stressed empathy with decline-era Kobe; P.O.S steers the vigilante study "".38 Airweight"" with the art-imitates-life-imitates-art invocation of Bernhard Goetz and Charles Bronson (the latter </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uYTFlD8K80"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>not for the first time</span></a><span>); Dessa rattles through a breathless itinerary on ""The Bends"" that sounds like instructions to an undercover fugitive. But each line feels more like a disconnected thought strung together in a more allusive whole, where you get the gist but still have to coax out the depth. ""Gray Duck"" alone is layers upon injokes upon regionalisms—the title's a reference to the Minnesota-specific variant on the childrens' game ""duck duck goose"", which in itself stands for their own ready-to-bolt restlessness, and it's filtered through everything from P.O.S.'s strength-through-confrontation approach (""All the fuck in your station/ All up in your dark/ Awkward in your Marc Maron conversations/ Call 'em out the park"") to Dessa's elemental momentum (""Sparks on the pavement, dragging the chain/ Anchor's off, man, lost it again"") to Sims' dichotomy-driven jokes (""I'm really real, half Built to Spill half </span><i>Kill at Will</i><span>"").</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So as you draw in messages that are more atmospheric than direct, there's still the allure of soaking in this music </span><span>as </span><span>music, all those contrasting voices turning comfortable truisms into uncomfortable knots. Voices harmonize in pop-punk-adjacent indie-anthem hooks. Lazerbeak and Paper Tiger (alongside Cecil and P.O.S.) deliver serrated, drum-splintering minor-key threat-beats fresh from the Neo Geo Orchestra. And the whole thing doesn't relieve the pressure on your chest until the vapor-trail comedown of closer ""Marathon"", which pares back the hovering-mothership menace just enough to reveal that this isn't music made to be stripped for parts: ""When it all boils down, there's nothin' but bones left.""</span></p></div>"|20070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20070-all-hands/|7.1|Nate Patrin

During the last decade, both of these delirious doom metal squads have issued records at startling clips, the pace sometimes so speedy it’s as if they’re desperate to outrun the doomsdays of which they so often yell. Apart from a brief pause two years ago, New Orleans’ Thou have offered a few titles a year, many of them splits or EPs that rerouted their sludge through small new capillaries. Despite several dozen releases, they’ve managed but four (intriguing, at worst, and inescapable, at best) full-lengths.</p>
<p>Much the same holds for Providence-to-Portland duo the Body. To date, they too have favored splits or collaborations with pals old and new, instead of records entirely dependent upon their spartan if seismic guitar-and-drums configuration. Since their 2010 breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14512-all-the-waters-of-the-earth-turn-to-blood/""><i>All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood</i></a>, itself a close hybrid with a hometown choir, they’ve released a few good splits, a terrific EP and only one album, the strangely self-satisfied <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18630-the-body-christs-redeemers/""><i>Christs, Redeemers</i></a>. Instead, some of their best work has arrived through a full-length collaboration with noise sculptor the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-haxan-cloak/"">Haxan Cloak</a> and now their second of two collaborations with Thou<i>,</i> <i>You, Whom I Have Always Hated</i>. It is a match made of mania and menace.</p>
<p>The six-song set is available as a limited-edition record through <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thrill Jockey</a>, the Body’s most recent and stable home. <a href=""http://thrilljockey.com/thrill/The-Body-and-Thou/Whom-I-Have-Always-Hated#.VMYxbsZQo7p"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The 10-track CD and digital editions</a>, however, warrant the most attention, especially if you missed last year’s <a href=""http://www.vinylrites.net/2014/04/released-from-love-out-now.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Released from Love</i></a>. That four-song EP captured the two bands holed away in a Louisiana studio at the beginning of 2013. The results are included here not as a prequel but as a necessary companion to the recent arrivals. Those Southern sessions made it clear that this is a painful and powerful fit for complementary brutes. Perhaps because of their economical configuration, the Body often affixes parts that aren’t noise, drums, guitars, or screams to the ends and beginnings of songs. The more versatile Thou, however, allow for more engrained subtlety. During opener ""The Wheel Weaves as the Wheel Wills"", Thou’s Bryan Funck delivers imprecations in his deep, full scream. Behind him, the Body’s Chip King squeals like a wounded animal, his high pitch offering a sliver of contrast to the mid-range, mid-tempo melee. A later cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNJKL_6MwT0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vic Chesnutt’s ""Coward""</a> seems as terrifying for the singers as it does for the listener. In his raspy falsetto, King yells the opening lines like a death cry. The band builds behind Funck as he bellows the chorus—""I, I, I, I, I, I am a coward""—until they collapse in exhaustion around the sound of that last word. A counter-riff adds drama to the stentorian march of ""In Meetings Hearts Beat Closer"", while mutated bridges afford misdirection to the aptly named ""Manifest Alchemy"". Thou and the Body could be wider and wilder together than separately.</p>
<p>The new material springboards from that same synthesis. Recorded in Providence during the middle of a shared July 2014 tour, the second batch hits hardest when these two bands land as one. There’s perhaps no better example than their reverent but explosive take on <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1727860/the-body-thou-terrible-lie-nine-inch-nails-cover/mp3s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails’ ""Terrible Lie""</a>. The crews reanimate the industrial architecture of the original, with guitars and bass turning the melody into a mess of forceful chords and corrosive feedback. And the beat gets massive, punched down as if both drummers were born wielding sledgehammers. The sound is as colossal as the Body’s but as sharp and severe as Thou’s—a combination that makes the 1989 template feel, by comparison, like little more than a stripped skeleton. Though ""The Devils of Trust Steal the Souls of the Free"" begins like the Body with more guitars or Thou with more drums, it captivates when King and Funck again split vocals. The song’s commandments, like ""Reach out and find nothing,"" only get shocking when it seems as though the whole world were yelling them at once. The pair slips when the results are expected, as if you’re listening to two bands play the same song at once rather than finesse the parts as one unit. ""Her Strongholds Unvanquishable"" and ""Lurking Free"" both stumble toward that mire, if not in it altogether. Tricks that make the Body and Thou’s own records interesting can start to feel like unnecessary crutches when they overcrowd the same shared space.</p>
<p>But those are aberrations for this collusion. Taken as a full-length by two groups that treat the format with some suspicion, <i>You, Whom I Have Always Hated </i>is a remarkably cohesive and singular album. Though it shows signs of both responsible parties, it also proves their inherent restlessness, as they’re both willing to bend toward one another to create something richer than they might have rendered themselves. It’s important that <i>You, Whom I Have Always Hated</i> marks the shortest effective span between successive LPs from either the Body or Thou. Perhaps together, they can continue to avoid boredom.</p></div>"|19970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19970-you-whom-i-have-always-hated/|7.6|Grayson Haver Currin

The line-up dissolved, and Miller was left more or less where he started, the lone Raindrop trying to keep the band moving along. Following last year’s <i>Live Rain</i>, which sounded less like a tour document than an exorcism, <i>Mansion Songs</i> is intended to signal a rebirth: Miller worked with co-producer Eric Bauer in San Francisco, using a variety of musicians rather than a concrete band roster. He has suggested that the album will be the first in a trilogy, and that disorienting cover shot literally shows Miller turning a corner.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Mansion Songs</i> does prove to be a pivotal album, especially because it sounds like Miller’s cleanest break from the crunch and grind of his former outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"">Comets on Fire</a>. He’s in full classic-rock mode here, summoning the ghosts of the Fillmore West on these eight songs. It’s not an album about the industry, and that is certainly to Miller’s credit; self-pity and bitterness are tedious topics for rock songs. Instead, this may be closer to a junkie record. ""Big Red Moon"" opens in the ""ghetto alleys and skid row bars"" of the Mission District, where Miller romanticizes the culture of addiction with lines like ""Tonight we’ll be kinsmen to the stars."" Later he admits, ""There’s slime running in my veins, mold on the walls of my heart.""</p>
<p>Especially when it’s delivered in Miller’s baroque gutter imagery, the down-and-out nature of addiction proves a problematic metaphor for professional woes, but really that’s the least of this album’s troubles. By embracing classic rock so wholeheartedly, Howlin Rain has become essentially a jam band, with little but its own history to distinguish it from acts like J.J. Grey &amp; Mofro and the dear-departed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6921-the-black-crowes/"">Black Crowes</a>. Those bands at least know something about rhythm and boogie, yet songs like ""Wild Bush"" and ""Meet Me in the Wheat"", with its hallelujah chorus, sound stiffly dramatic, resorting to the same grandiose choruses. Burrowing into his rock-and-roll shaman persona, Miller overenunciates wildly, less <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"">Dead</a> than Joplin at her booziest, escalating too readily into histrionics. By the time ""Coliseum"" builds from its quiet opening to its thunderous climax, he’s bellowing ostentatiously, yet his vocals convey only the vaguest emotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Mansion Songs </i>ends with the seven-minute ""Ceiling Fan"", a spoken-word number that allows Miller to indulge his Beat aspirations alongside his classic-rock signifiers. Musically, it’s the grittiest-sounding track on the album, with eddies and distortion clotting the guitar licks and evoking the more destitute vistas of San Francisco. Lyrically, however, the song sounds entirely disingenuous, as Miller namedrops <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24252-werner-herzog/"">Werner Herzog</a>, Federico Fellini, Walt Whitman, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>, J.G. Ballard, and even that old stand-by, William Blake. It’s a distracting tactic, a curious way for a bold artist to defer to the spines on his bookshelf. As a result, when Miller shouts out to all the underrepresented subcultures around the Bay—a moment that really ought to be the climax of both the album and his career, a moment that should point the way forward for a hard-luck musician—he simply gets lost in his raft of influences.</p></div>"|20089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20089-mansion-songs/|4.7|Stephen M.

So writes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>’s Kieran Hebden in the liner notes to this reissue of a rare piece from Italian percussionist/minimalist composer Lino Capra Vaccina. Hebden goes on to cite totemic albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5881-alice-coltrane/"">Alice Coltrane</a>’s spiritual jazz masterpiece </span><i>Journey to Satchidananda</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18454-don-cherry/"">Don Cherry</a>’s world music forbearer </span><i>Organic Music Society</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> as these sorts of ""idealized"" concepts, adding Vaccina’s 1978 album </span><i>Antico Adagio</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> to that short list.</span></p>
<p>Out of print for decades, the punctilious Italian label <a href=""http://www.dieschachtel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Die Schachtel</a> now reissues Vaccina’s debut album along with another half-hour of previously unheard compositions making for nearly 70 minutes of glorious, shimmering minimalism. <span>It would not be remiss to think of </span><i>Antico Adagio</i><span> as the slightly more European cousin to </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a><span>’s flawless </span><i>Music for 18 Musicians</i><span>, taken with the infinite patterns that can be rendered from percussion and metallophones.</span> In the past few years, there’s been a deluge of bell-like sounds—either acoustic or computer-generated—with producers like Four Tet, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28121-gold-panda/"" target=""_blank"">Gold Panda</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27655-jon-hopkins/"" target=""_blank"">Jon Hopkins</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5293-pantha-du-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Pantha du Prince</a> deploying them. It’s the kind of pure tone that serves as connection between a particular strain of American minimalism of the 1970s and modern electronic music, making extant the lineage between the two disciplines. So while this album will find fans of the former, those who favor the latter will also have such struck metal resonate.</p>
<p>Rather than the crack ensemble who performed Reich’s music, most of <i>Antico Adagio</i> is rendered by Vaccina alone, who is credited with vibraphone, marimba, tablas, darbuke, gong, cymbals, bells, metal sheets, tom, and snare. Smatterings of other sounds like oboe, violin and female voices also mix in and it never quite feels like the work of one lone drummer banging on metal. Carefully layering these voices, there are moments that bring to mind Gregorian chants and Tuvan throat singing, or when '60s psychedelic acts cast their voices in massive amounts of echo to suggest the blackness of deep space.</p>
<p>In the CD notes, Vaccina calls his approach to music-making ""sound ecology,"" talking about how free improvised concerts in public spaces in the late 1960s and the examples of American minimalists Glass and Reich—the latter’s <i>Drumming</i> a touchstone—led him to the making of this album. Openers ""Elegia"" and ""Voice in XY"" most closely resemble Reich’s layers of percussion, which move from snowflake-contemplative to dizzying in a few minutes, the pulsing rhythms evoking visions of crystal lattices and the kinds of sprockets and clockworks one might have glimpsed in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970179/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Hugo</i></a>.</p>
<p>But the album does more than merely reflect the example of Reich, venturing from such resplendent, beautiful moments into darker, more gnarled terrain. On experimental pieces like ""Chants of the Spheres"" and ""Fragments of Sleep"", percussion mixes in with voice and the music more closely resembles the likes of This Heat and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLW0n2sLCG4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Saucerful of Secrets""</a>. The careful pacing of the ten-minute title track moves with gentle grace. At some moments it reminds me of Pharoah Sanders’s <i>Tauhid</i> and jazz vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson; at others of a Javanese gamelan performance in a royal court. But many times, Vaccina’s music sounds like something beyond your imagination.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p></div>"|20118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20118-antico-adagio/|7.9|Andy Beta

She crafts slow-burning soul music indebted to singers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5219-dolly-parton/"">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5038-dusty-springfield/"">Dusty Springfield</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6113-jenny-lewis/"">Jenny Lewis</a> (with whom she toured as a backing vocalist), and she makes her home in Nashville, where she settled after stints in Cleveland, Virginia Beach, and Boston’s Berklee College of Music. (She dropped out after only a year because she thought the city was too big.) In Richmond, Va., she found her people at <a href=""http://spacebombrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spacebomb Records</a>, the label run by retro revivalist and high school friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30501-matthew-e-white/"">Matthew E. White</a>. He and producer Trey Pollard hooked her up with the Spacebomb house band, and helped craft her debut album, <i>Natalie Prass</i>, around luxuriant string-and-horn-heavy instrumentation to give her smoldering perspective on passionate romance some pomp and circumstance.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When the album opens, Prass is telling us she doesn’t feel much, which would sound more like a joke if her voice didn't sound so somber. <i>Natalie Prass</i> is an album of relationships troubled by misunderstandings, of earnest lovers caught in the claws of the unmerciful. She sounds lighter than air as she sings lyrics devastating in their economy, addressing someone who ""plucked me from the vine"" on ""Bird of Prey"" and later telling someone else (or the same person?) ""I just want to know you violently"" on ""Violently"". The latter reminds me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16931-your-love-is-killing-me/"">""Your Love Is Killing Me""</a>—the songs even share a similar lyric about having their legs broken so they won’t walk to someone all wrong for them. (Yikes!)</p>
<p>But Prass sounds positively uplifted as the band swells over her lovesick harmonies, forgoing any tortured abnegation. There’s idealism in her voice that’s tempered by heartbreak without falling prey to cynicism—like the bitterness has been skimmed off the top, leaving an evergreen sweetness. In an <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-long-hello-natalie-prasss-beautiful-time-tested-fairy-tale/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Grantland, Prass said the record was completed in early 2012. ""Violently"" dates as far back as 2009, when she was still in college. What’s remarkable is how the songwriting coheres into one vision, even as Prass herself must’ve changed over the years. Recently, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31319-run-the-jewels"">Run the Jewels</a> participated in Rookie’s ""Ask a Grown Man"" video series, where they <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/58140-run-the-jewels-give-advice-to-teenage-girls-for-rookies-ask-a-grown-man/"">doled out advice</a> on life and love to teenage girls. During one question, Killer Mike said that love should feel good—that it shouldn’t hurt. Fine advice for hormonal romantics just starting out, but anyone with an ounce of life experience knows it doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p><i>Natalie Prass</i> is officially the work of nearly three-dozen musicians, most of whom played horns or strings for Spacebomb’s house band. (Prass has called the record ""a community."") The arrangements were handled by White and Pollard, and they’re crucial. Without those horns and strings, the repeated refrain of ""our love is a long goodbye"" toward the end of ""My Baby Don’t Understand Me"" wouldn’t percolate to a rolling boil before exploding in that final, devastating delivery. Still, it would be unwise to think that any old singer-songwriter would work with this band behind them. What makes <i>Natalie Prass</i> is her confident delivery amidst so many unconfident feelings—the way she nimbly skips over the verses on ""Bird of Prey"", or walks along the groove on ""Why Don’t You Believe in Me"". She sounds comfortable and in charge, wielding her massive band like a wizard’s scepter.</p>
<p><span>Prass is most impressive working within the biggest instrumentation, where her emotional precision acts as a counterweight for all the textural grandiosity. The songs where the drums don’t do the driving, like ""Christy"" or ""It Is You"", raise the question of what the album would sound like were she a more bombastic singer, capable of blowing out speakers. Prass herself seems aware of her limitations. ""I don’t think I’m the most talented musician or the best singer, but I work really, really hard,"" she told <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9553-natalie-prass/"">Pitchfork</a>. ""And sometimes these random things happen, and it makes you keep going."" </span>As mantras go, ""I’m not the best but I work really hard"" isn’t the type to get turned into a Tumblr macro, but the result makes <i>Natalie Prass</i> a warm, intimate debut album that leaves space for darker contemplation—those stray thoughts that light you up at the end of the night.</p></div>"|20088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20088-natalie-prass/|8.3|Jeremy Gordon

The city's new generation doesn’t see such boundaries. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a> works with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"">iLoveMakonnen</a>; Makonnen works with Trinidad James; Trinidad collaborates with OG Maco, who is signed to the same label as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a>. Atlanta is now a place where rappers, producers, trappers, and hipsters work in the same studios, wind up at the same parties, and end their evenings at the same strip clubs.</p>
<p>Trinidad James, though much derided from people outside of the Atlanta when he arrived in 2012 with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK2FqPNIT_U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Gold Everything""</a>, is particularly adept at moving between scenes. He was a local store clerk known for his eccentric style and he eventually grabbed a Top 40 hit off an unforgettable video. Though often mocked for his sartorial choices (leather, Versace, animal prints), Trinidad's style proved to be popular with other Atlanta rappers (Migos, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>) in the years that followed. But a confident fashion sense isn’t necessarily translatable to music, so Trinidad's path has been an uphill climb over the last couple of years.</p>
<p><i>No One Is $afe </i>is a disappointing step back from his earlier work. His 2013 mixtape <i>10 Pc. Mild</i> kept the molly-downing and liquor-drinking identity from ""All Gold Everything"" but didn't have a strong single, even if he got brothers from another galaxy Fabo and Danny Brown <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP6A3912UiI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on the same track</a>. Last year, after being dumped from Def Jam, his music turned more <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/trinidad-jame/doin-me-prod-raak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">downtrodden</a> and frustrated. Here, he seems unsure of which direction to go.</p>
<p>The scattershot nature of <i>No One Is $afe</i> is initially appealing but grows tiresome. He makes a case for psychedelics as the party drug of choice on ""$hroom Party"" over the muted horns of the young producer Brandon Thomas. He moves between the opposite ends of 2014 Atlanta in the gleefully downtrodden ""H.O.M.E."" with iLoveMakonnen and the frantic darkness of OG Maco on ""ALLAU$"". There is even a track, ""T Jame$ Expre$$"", which sounds like blog house, but novelty can't sustain it. For all those odd turns, the heavily trap ""Only N Atlanta"" with Offset of Migos and Peewee Longway is the tape’s highlight, as the trio brags about spending racks at Lennox Square Mall and Phipps Plaza, two of Atlanta’s landmarks of capitalism. As Trinidad moves through typical rap tropes (sex talk, putting down other rappers) and repeatedly falls flat, he ultimately sounds overextended. He may care about fashion and the people around him, but on <i>No One Is $afe </i>he struggles to find where the music fits into his life these days.</p></div>"|20176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20176-no-one-is-afe/|5.5|David Turner

There was <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17554-a-wonder-working-stone"" target=""_blank"">A Wonder Working Stone</a></i>, the 2013 album billed to his group Alasdair Roberts &amp; Friends, and <a href=""http://stonetaperecordings.bandcamp.com/album/hirta-songs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Hirta Songs</i></a>, his full-length collaboration with poet Robin Robertson. Then last year saw <i>At Our Next Meeting</i>, the excellent debut album of traditional folk ballads by his new group the <a href=""http://www.thefurrowcollective.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Furrow Collective</a>. So it seems noteworthy that, after all of these various collaborations, his latest <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a> album comes self-billed and self-titled. Often when such a veteran artist releases an eponymous album it is for purposes of redefinition, but <i>Alasdair Roberts</i> feels more like a simple re-centering, and a paring back of his music to the purest essentials.</p>
<p>As most of his recent work should make abundantly clear, Roberts creates folk music without much need for any additional prefixes or modifiers. It has long been his practice to balance his original songs with a deep appreciation for the traditional folk of the British Isles and, as the Furrow Collective have put it, ""balladry at its darkest and quirkiest."" On <i>Alasdair Roberts</i> he sticks exclusively with original material, although a simple scan of the song titles (""The Mossy Shrine"", ""The Final Diviner"") might camouflage that fact. Compared to such previous solo works as 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13110-spoils/""><i>Spoils</i></a>, and certainly to the more raucous group work on <i>A Wonder Working Stone</i>, Roberts’ songs here are quieter and simpler, and his language less ornate. And while all of Roberts’ music, even at its most traditional, has sounded unique and intimate it has seldom sounded this personal.</p>
<p>Although these songs are more concise, Roberts retains an abiding love for dense lyricism, internal rhyme schemes, and melodies that wind their way along like wild vines gradually unspooling over stony ruins. And his keening Scottish brogue remains as rich as fresh cream, so any attempt to fully interpret his lyrics with American ears is a pathway to misadventure. But from where I sit, songs such as ""Artless One"" and ""This Uneven Thing"" might stand as the barest, most undisguised love songs in Roberts’ catalog. The latter is an especially affecting lament of long distance or unrequited romance, and it’d take a steely soul to not be moved when Roberts sings ""If I had known before we courted that love would be this uneven thing/ I’d have packed my heart in box of iron and chained it down with a leaden ring.""</p>
<p>It should be noted that although Roberts gets solo billing here he is far from alone. On nearly every song his voice and nimble guitar lines are joined by Alex South’s clarinet and Donald Lindsay’s tin whistle, as well as backing vocals from singing quartet the Crying Lion. The presence of so much tin whistle, in fact, might be a stumbling block for listeners who associate the instrument with too many bad St. Patrick’s Day memories or the <i>Titanic </i>soundtrack. This is no fault of Lindsay, however, and here the wind instruments add undeniable atmosphere and do much of the heavy melodic lifting on more rambling tunes like the ruminative ""Hurricane Brown"".</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the album Roberts seems to take a step back to address the state of folk music itself and the role of the artist in a troubled world. Throughout the record he sides with the underdogs and the outsiders who choose to take, as one title puts, ""The Way Unfavoured"".  On the closing ""Roomful of Relics"" he describes the loneliness of the folklorist’s life. ""Men have withdrawn and left me alone in a roomful of relics,"" he sings in what seems a combination of pride and chagrin, ""but I carry the song that all men inherit."" And as this album shows once again, that inherited tradition is very safe in Alasdair Roberts’ expert hands, and it is treated here with an uncommon tenderness and simplicity of vision.</p></div>"|20049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20049-alasdair-roberts/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

So says José Pascual, of Antwerp's USA Import shop, in <a href=""http://watch.tsob.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Sound of Belgium</i></a>, a fascinating 2012 documentary about the country's remarkable club scene—or scenes, really, going all the way back to the ""mirror balls"" of the post-war years, with their punchcard-controlled organs. He's talking specifically about the boom mentality that accompanied New Beat, an electronic-music craze that gripped the nation in the years between 1986 and 1989.</p>
<p>The sound of New Beat is relatively easy to describe. A homegrown strain that borrowed from new wave, EBM, and Chicago acid, it was dark, menacing, sensually severe, and distinguished largely by its torpid chug of a pulse. New Beat stemmed, in part, from Belgian DJs' propensity to play records at the wrong speed. The genre's foundational track is said to be A Split-Second's 1986 single ""Flesh"", played at 33 RPM instead of 45. (Incredibly, this turns out not to have been an entirely new concept: Belgian DJs pioneered the technique in the so-called ""Popcorn"" scene of the 1970s, playing obscure American soul 45s from the 1950s and '60s at 33 RPM, pitched up to +8. The result was to make the songs sound deeper, fuller, and just a little bit <i>off</i>, but not exaggeratedly so—disorienting, but not distorted.)</p>
<p>Adherents of the movement describe New Beat's effects in rapturous terms. It was slow enough that you could dance to it all night without tiring, and without drugs (although drugs, we can assume, were definitely a part of the mix). The bass did weird things at slower tempos, its frequencies greasy and swollen; spine-tingling electronic timbres and undulating acid lines added to the music's hypnotic properties. In the film, Renaat Vandepapeliere, founder of the R&amp;S label, describes the Boccaccio, a Belgian nightclub that served as the high temple of New Beat, as ""a dark inferno… a slowed-down movie."" The veteran Dutch DJ Eddy De Clercq says of the club, ""It was cramped and eerie. But that's what the DJ was looking for—this uncomfortable, grisly atmosphere.""</p>
<p>New Beat was an underground phenomenon in the sense that commercial radio wouldn't touch it, but it was wildly successful. Money flooded the scene; anything with ""New Beat"" stamped on the cover would sell, and sell in astonishing numbers. Even ho-hum singles could shift 30,000 copies—no small feat for a country of 10 million. (In adjusted terms, in the United States—which then had a population of 244 million—that would equate to selling 782,000 copies.) Popular singles were moving as many as 60,000 units, equivalent to platinum certification in the United States, all without any commercial airplay. ""Bands"" like Erotic Dissidents, whose performance consisted entirely of lip-synching, earned the equivalent of 1000 euros for 20 minutes on stage. With those kinds of numbers in play, producers with no connection to the underground club scene began to churn out New Beat. It was easy to make, after all; all you needed was a synthesizer and a drum machine. (Having even a modicum of musical theory gave you a vast advantage over most of your competition.) As the frenzy built up steam, it came to resemble the Dutch tulip mania 350 years prior. As one producer tells the filmmakers, ""We had to act fast, because we knew it wouldn't last. It was much too unreal.""</p>
<p>Rembert De Smet doesn't appear in <i>The Sound of Belgium</i>, but he was one of New Beat's fellow travelers. Even the press release for a new anthology of his work paints the former new waver (and eventual flamenco guitarist) as something of a bandwagon-jumper: ""Producing without a pause and getting the music out the week after was the plan, as one knew that this lucrative era wouldn't last forever."" In the early and mid '80s, De Smet was a member of the duo 2 Belgen (""2 Belgians""), a synth-pop act that found reasonable success at home but never broke internationally. As the new style took off, however, he adopted the name Ro Maron and began releasing New Beat tracks under a dizzying array of further aliases, both solo and in collaboration with producers like Ferre Baelen and Jean-Lou Nowé. <i>Collected #1</i> gathers the work of 20 of those assorted aliases—acts like Zsa Zsa LaBoum, Air of Gloom, Kaos 007, 2 Body's (sic), Trance Trax, Beat Beat Beat—the bulk of which was recorded between 1988 and 1990.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with EBM and early acid house, the tropes here won't be entirely unfamiliar. Track after track is built out of brittle drum-machine programming and squelchy, rubbery acid sequences. Handclaps claw through clammy reverb like fingers scrabbling against moss-slicked dungeon walls, and the programmed drum beats lurch with zombie-like stiffness (a sensation heightened by drill-sergeant chants of ""Left, right, left, right, left, right, left!"" that kick off the very second song). The music is for the most part instrumental: there are no lyrics, just sampled mantras repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> (""Welcome to my acid house,"" ""Gimme some acid,"" ""<i>A la recherché du temps perdue</i>,"" etc.), and chemical mischief bubbles to the surface in songs like ""Brainkiller"", which cribs its bassline from ""White Lines"" and mutters about ""pleasure area[s] in the brain.""</p>
<p>At 35 tracks and three hours long, it's an enormous amount of material to wrap one's head around, but a lot of it turns out to be pretty great. The gnarled acid and wet-cardboard kick drum of 2 Body's ""Body Drill"" wouldn't be out of place on the L.I.E.S. label today. SM's ""SM"", with its sampled yelps and fidgety, chromatic arpeggios, balances industrial grit with the more playful funk of contemporary groups like Colourbox. Sleepwalker's ""All Jazz"" features a killer squarewave bass line that anticipates Biosphere's ""Novelty Waves"".  Those kinds of reference points are all over the collection, a reminder that while he may have been an outsider and an opportunist, De Smet's work was deeply enmeshed in a dance-music tradition that stretches backwards and forwards across generations. I don't think it would be a stretch to call him a pioneer: he may not have invented the acid techniques and rhythmic tropes that pepper his music, but his work overflows with vision and unique character.</p>
<p>Even on the most pro-forma genre studies, like Sleepwalker's proto-deep-house ""Sleepwalker"", there's something about the odd proportions—the synthesized sax line that's just a little bit too loud; the vocal line that sounds better suited for a Factory release—that distinguishes it from its peers. ""Cute Acid"" is another one that grabs your attention for the way it conjures a kind of temporal Uncanny Valley: if you heard it in a nightclub, you'd be hard-pressed to say whether it was a vintage cut or a brand-new production. It vaguely reminds me of <i>Bradley's Robot</i>, a record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> released under the Bradley Strider alias in 1993, but its nimble percussion, bright colors, and birdsong timbres—the title ""Cute Acid"" was certainly well chosen—sound unlike anything I've heard before.</p>
<p><i>The Sound of Belgium</i>'s filmmakers make a good case that New Beat deserves more attention than it has received until now. The genre's main components may have been invented in Chicago and Detroit, but New Beat came so close on their heels that the genre should be seen less as a mere imitation of African-American electronic music, and more a crucial node in a conversation that bounced back and forth across oceans and borders. (Many riffs from New Beat and early Belgian rave music would become staples of the U.K.'s breakbeat hardcore.) From a contemporary perspective, it's clear that De Smet's work, as commercially motivated as it may have been, helped expand the possibilities for this eerie, not-quite-underground music on the cusp of conquering the world.

Composed entirely of drum-less, guitar-twanged, synth-washed instrumentals, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18139-peals-walking-field/""><i>Walking Field</i></a> was designed as the low-key antidote to the more frantic, post-punk-informed music that Bruce Willen and William Cashion had fashioned with their more visible primary acts. The album was both something of a somber, campfire memorial for Willen’s defunct art-punk outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5580-double-dagger/"">Double Dagger</a> (who disbanded in 2011), and an opportunity for him and Cashion to experiment with moods and sounds unbound by standard rock-song strictures.</p>
<p>However, after Cashion’s other group—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/"">Future Islands</a>—inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54254-david-letterman-trying-to-turn-future-islands-samuel-t-herrings-dance-moves-into-a-meme/"">one of 2014’s most memorable memes</a> and rocketed to top-draw headliner status, Peals has become an all the more necessary sanctuary. Rather than put the project on hold while Future Islands field their summer-festival offers, Peals are reasserting their modest intents in the most extreme manner possible: with a limited-run cassette-only release—and one you can’t even purchase as a digital download at that. But the cassette issue amounts to more than just a contrarian act of antiquated-format fetishism—it’s actually the most appropriate medium through which to experience the two, half-hour suites that comprise <i>Seltzer</i>.</p>
<p>In essence, <i>Seltzer</i> is an ultra-exclusive document of an ultra-exclusive performance. Its first half is pulled from an April 2013 event that saw Peals debut a new improvised work—amid projections by artist Zoe Friedman—in the extremely cramped clock room of Baltimore’s historic <a href=""http://www.bromoseltzertower.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bromo Seltzer Arts Tower</a>, a former antacid dispensary that’s been converted into studio spaces. But even in the absence of Friedman’s visuals and the room’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwLT0SmXEU4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">imposing, industrialized innards</a>, the piece—boasting <a href=""http://media.giphy.com/media/4Dy1Btpt0qUZa/giphy.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the prophetically McConaughey-esque</a> title of ""Time Is a Milk Bowl""—exudes a vivid sense of place. More hazy and vaporous than the melancholic reveries of <i>Walking Field</i>, this sweetly serene symphony of glimmering glockenspiels, tranquil tremolos, and aquatic Eno-esque ambience is tuned to the pervasive hum of the clock motors (in the key of G, Peals note) while using the intrusive clatter of the building’s old elevator mechanism to signal sectional shifts. <a href=""http://clocktower.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/bodyview_enlarged/event/12382/node-image.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fenced in by the room’s four giant clock-faced walls</a>, Peals are surrounded by oppressive reminders of time’s passage, yet patiently play as if totally oblivious to it. But after 25 minutes of slowly layered swells, Willen and Cashion build up a tick-tock rhythm and intertwining guitar melodies into a cheery, chiming melodic passage that reorients this amorphous movement toward a linear and satisfyingly ascendant finale.</p>
<p>If ""Time Is a Milk Bowl"" feels like the sort of high-quality cassette bootleg that would’ve been a prized tradable commodity in the pre-Internet era, <i>Seltzer</i>’s second piece, ""Before and After"", indulges in another of the format’s popular uses: the mixtape collage. The track stitches together a career-spanning cache of unearthed demos, with enough tape hiss, click-track test runs, abruptly abandoned song snippets, and caught-on-tape chair squeaks to fill <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13681-suitcase-3-up-we-go-now/"">another Guided by Voices suitcase</a>. While its deliberately fragmentary nature means it never develops and envelops on the same scale as ""Time Is a Milk Bowl"", nor strike the same emotional chords as <i>Walking Field</i>, ""Before and After"" is an intermittently engaging, channel-clicker tour through the various styles of pre-millennial indie rock that form Peals’ musical foundation, from the more meditative end of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a> canon to the frosty chill of the early <a href=""http://www.kranky.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kranky</a> catalogue to the rustic form of post-rock that took root on the <a href=""http://cstrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Constellation</a> and <a href=""http://www.southern.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Southern Records</a> rosters. And its scattered presentation more explicitly reinforces a quality that Willen and Cashion’s more subtly evolutionary work only hints at: that, for a stridently mellow band with no rhythm section, Peals are a restless beast.</p></div>"|20120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20120-seltzer/|7.0|Stuart Berman

But her albums over the past decade have underwhelmed, despite their reach and sense of craft. Part of it’s how Björk, as she’s grown as an artist, has grown inward; at her best (parts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/737-medulla/""><i>Medúlla</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/""><i>Biophilia</i></a>), her albums come off like slivers of some grand unrealized possibility—undeniably dazzling, but intimidating for everyone who isn’t Björk. At her worst (parts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10204-volta/""><i>Volta</i></a>), those slivers are contorted, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Procrustes</a>-style, into the easy templates she left behind somewhere around <i>Debut</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But part of it’s the tendency to make Björk into other, false versions of herself: Björk the wayward pop figure, Björk the wearer of the outfits that became memes, Björk the metaphor-smitten New Ager, Björk as the quirky vessel for her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9582-the-invisible-woman-a-conversation-with-bjork/"">male collaborators,</a> rather than the person with complete creative and curatorial control over all aspects of her music. Even Björk the genius, who works in the abstract, disconnected from, as she once sang, ""the exchange of human emotions."" But for all her classical ambitions and hyperextended metaphors, the best Björk tracks express startlingly direct emotional truths, blown up to their towering real-life scale.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Nowhere is this more clear than on her ninth album proper,<i> </i><i>Vulnicura</i>. Co-produced by Arca (Kanye West’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>, FKA twigs’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19590-twigs-lp1/"">LP1</a>, </i>his own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19836-arca-xen/""><i>Xen</i></a>) and the Haxan Cloak and drawing on Björk’s split with artist Matthew Barney, the album places itself among the most human, emotionally candid, even <i>functional</i> of art forms: the breakup album. Its position is deliberate; in conversation with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9582-the-invisible-woman-a-conversation-with-bjork/"">Pitchfork</a>, she called <i>Vulnicura</i> a ""traditional singer/songwriter thing,"" suggesting something plainspoken, modest, even folksy. Perhaps unsurprisingly, <i>Vulnicura </i>is none of these things, but it’s simultaneously her most mature feat of arranging and almost psychosomatically affecting. It’s also, as was widely reported, with us a few months early. While it’d be wrong to say it’s for the <i>best </i>that <i>Vulnicura </i>was leaked <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6450345/how-bjorks-team-handled-vulnicura-leak-behind-the"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">then rush-released</a>—no one in Björk’s position would welcome that—the leak does her an inadvertent service: it makes <i>Vulnicura</i> the first Björk album in years to come into the world untethered by museum exhibitions, movie tie-ins, iPad apps, or promo cycles involving Timbaland. We receive it simply on its own iconoclastic terms.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Vulnicura </i>is loosely arranged around the chronology of a relationship: the period before the breakup, the dazed moments after, the slow recovery. It’s a sense of time that’s both hyper-specific—in the liner notes, Björk places each song up until the two-thirds mark in an exact point on the timeline, from nine months before to 11 months after—and loose, with half-moments that span entire dramatic arcs. ""History of Touches"", for example, is a near-forensic exhumation of the precise time of relationship death. The song begins and ends upon the narrator waking her soon-to-be-ex-lover, and Arca’s programming develops in slow motion as Björk’s vocal and lyric circle back upon the scale and warp the timeline: ""The history of touches, every single archive compressed into a second."" There’s some <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVHpBCjUu8M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cocoon""</a> in there, in the post-coital setting and smitten sigh, but there’s also the unmistakable sense that everything Björk describes is expiring as she speaks it. It’s luxuriant and bleary and sad, something like sleepwalking infatuated through an autopsy. Skip to several months after in the record's progression, album centerpiece ""Black Lake"", a masterwork of balancing elements: Björk’s requiem strings leading to Arca’s tectonic-plate percussion and vocal patches, cuttingly <i>crafted </i>(in unmistakably Björk fashion) lines like ""I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions"" giving way to lines far more unadorned and unanswerable: ""Did I love you too much?""</p>
<p class=""p1"">What keeps these questions from sounding maudlin are those flashes of rueful wit (elsewhere, on ""Family"": ""Is there a place where I can pay respects for the death of my family?"") and Björk’s vocal delivery; she’s at least twice expressed her admiration, at the pure musical level, of <i>fado </i>singer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP4BnfUm0eI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amália Rodrigues</a>, and you can hear it in how she leans into syllables, indulging feelings then dissecting them. Rarely does <i>Vulnicura </i>sound anything but seamless; her palette blends in drum-and-bass loops, flatline effects, groaning cellos, pitch-warped echoes by Antony Hegarty. The more Björk has grown as an arranger, the less dated her albums sound; closer ""Quicksand"" initially scans like it’s approaching over-timely <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31420-rudimental/"">Rudimental</a> territory, but it’s a little late in the album for that, and this is soon subsumed into a string reverie that’s unmistakably hers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In Björk’s discography, <i>Vulnicura </i>most resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/727-vespertine/""><i>Vespertine</i></a>, another unyieldingly cerebral work about vulnerability and being turned by love to besotted viscera, and also an unmistakably <i>female </i>album. <i>Vulnicura </i>doubles down on these elements, from the choir arrangements to the yonic wound imagery of the cover, like Björk’s attempt at a grand unified photoshoot of female pain, to <i>Vulnicura</i>’s echoes from the first track (""Moments of clarity are so rare—I better document this"") of the long tradition of women artists thinking and rethinking their own life stories, in public, until they coalesce into art. Fittingly, when Björk dispenses with the breakup framework (and timestamps) two-thirds of the way through the album, <i>Vulnicura</i> becomes about more. ""Mouth Mantra"" is part glitchy nightmare of grotesque imagery (""my mouth was sewn up… I was not heard"") and part reassertion of her artistic identity: ""this tunnel has enabled thousands of sounds.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">It isn’t just her. ""I want to support young girls who are in their 20s now and tell <i>them you’re not just imagining things</i>,"" she told Pitchfork, and on ""Quicksand"" <i>Vulnicura </i>shifts finally from personal documentation of one person’s rough year to words for those who’ve stayed for it all: ""Every time you give up, you take away our future and my continuity—and my daughter’s, and her daughters, and her daughters,"" Björk sings on the track, just before it cuts off mid-string cadenza. It’s possible to hear this as resignation, but it’s also possible to hear it as a note of hope, that there <i>is </i>a future after coming out of such an emotional wringer, if not quite one that’s reassuring. The ambiguity feels honest.</p></div>"|20181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20181-vulnicura/|8.6|Katherine St. Asaph

Now, as Petite Noir, he sings in a deep, sonorous voice and plays an itchy, gently polyrhythmic mix of music that he has cannily packaged in interviews as ""noir-wave,"" meaning a mix of new wave and South African influences. The parts are present—the clipped, piping guitars are reminiscent of the West African genre highlife while also reminding '80s rock fans of post-punk bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a>—but Ilunga’s music doesn’t feel like hybrid music. It feels seamless, subtle and lithe and luminously sexy, and it probably took his entire childhood of musical wandering to arrive at something so slick and assured.</p>
<p>The vocals are the immediate standout, as they were when Petite Noir first surfaced way back in 2012, with ""Till We Ghosts"". Ilunga has been slowly adding songs to his name since then, each one a striking addition to a slender catalog, and most of those songs are rounded up on this five-song EP, called <i>The King of Anxiety</i>. On the strength of this slight batch of material, Ilunga was signed to Domino, and he is going to be recording a full-length for them this year. In the meantime, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"">Solange Knowles</a> and Yasiin Bey (aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2838-mos-def/"">Mos Def</a>) have noticed him. His career has been a slow, graceful build, like his music.</p>
<p>""Come Inside"" builds from a modal guitar figure that Ilunga sings over directly. The song’s call-and-response structure and the spine-slipping thump of its bass drums ground it loosely in blues-based traditions, but Ilunga keeps the music’s borders vague and blurry, adding in some warped synths and post-punk guitar leads. His voice, rich and soothing, buffs the surface and keeps the emotional temperature at a low bubble. No matter how many parts are moving inside of his songs, <i>The King of Anxiety</i> always feels calm and serene.  Ilunga’s words are simple—""Only you can make me the pain,"" ""When I fall, you welcome me inside""—and the songs have a lucid-dream quality, a sense that nothing inside of them can truly go wrong.</p>
<p>""I don’t know, but you’re taking me for a fool, boy,"" he sings on ""Chess"", a lovestruck song that he delivers in his surprisingly hefty falsetto. The song details some sort of  heartbreak or betrayal, but it feels purposefully soft-focus and enigmatic, right down to the gender pronouns, which never quite settle. It’s an enigmatic scene, focusing on the redemptive quality of heartache more than the pain—when someone’s hurt us, we’re often more sure of who we are than before, and this is the energy ""Chess"" dials into. It’s the most textured, detailed and ambitious of the EP’s five compositions, shot through with a tremulous, almost chaste feeling, a soft sexiness that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"">Bloc Party</a> singles like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzZQJZdcCU4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""So Here We Are""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziDdEAmsNBE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Still Remember""</a>.</p>
<p>The Bloc Party resemblance underlines a point: There is nothing technically very ""new"" sounding in Ilunga's blends, which wouldn't shock or confuse anyone who has heard a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a> song. But they are instantly appealing and starry-eyed and romantic, and they will make tremendously powerful network-TV drama music. He has a nice grasp on how song structure and arrangement can shift the mood imperceptibly, and minute musical changes—the shift from drum programming into complicated live drumming in the last minute of ""Chess"", to take one example—alter the fabric of the music in significant ways. He seems to be working very carefully and slowly, but the result is hard to argue with: These songs feel obvious the first time you hear them and then slowly grow more sophisticated over time. </p></div>"|20170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20170-the-king-of-anxiety-ep/|8.2|Jayson Greene

At the risk of sounding a little like the pair have wandered into the rap game, the new name works; ""ejecta"" is the word for the dust that falls after a volcano erupts or a meteorite strikes the earth. Fresh dust implies a recent impact, and so does the duo's new record, <i>The Planet</i>, which sees Macomber reeling from heartbreak and trauma.</span></p>
<p><span>The EP's near-title track ""Your Planet"" is an ode to Macomber's close friend who died at 20. To mourn him, she imagined him in his own, new world, looking fondly down at Earth like a lost Little Prince laughing among the stars. ""You were the only one who ever loved me,"" she intones on the track, while Ford transitions from celestial organ to an outer space dance party bass line. In mourning there's also celebration, and ""Your Planet"" gently wraps its tendrils around both.</span></p>
<p>Ford, who's known for collaborating with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> as half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>, enjoys testing the edges of tastefulness with cheap-sounding synth patches. Like the <a href=""http://pcmusic.info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PC Music</a> tricksters, he's interested in that porous boundary between cool and corny, and he oscillates all over it here. It works and it doesn't; ""Your Planet"" feels appropriately sci-fi and sad, and the blushing pop opener ""Into Your Heart"" pounds with all the adrenaline of a brand new crush. But the chirpy bass on ""All Day"" tends to meander without an endgame, cartoony and brash next to Macomber's delicate singing.</p>
<p><span>When Young Ejecta nail in a song, they nail it clean. ""Into Your Heart"" blooms with the best of them as Macomber's long melodic phrases spiral out of the atmosphere, while Ford's club bass and drum beat rattle like a star fighter out of hell. ""Is there any way I can dive into your heart?"" wonders Macomber, her voice dry and double-tracked, unsheathed from the reverb that clouded Ejecta's debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18739-ejecta-dominae/""><i>Dominae</i></a>. Ford's quaking backbeat compounds the question's anxiety. The stakes are high, and Young Ejecta swoops to meet them with grace. </span></p>
<p><span>Macomber emotes better without those effects, but her newly clean singing can feel at odds with Ford's harshly synthetic compositions. She's a subtle vocalist, giving a light touch to lyrics about lazy days spent masturbating on ""Welcome to Love"". When Ford's fake, fake strings enter the chorus, it muddies the effect. Macomber wraps self-deprecation, frustration, and pure yearning into the way she sings just a few words, and Ford struggles to match that complexity. The two musicians match well in terms of overall ethos, but at some points it feels like they just stopped listening to each other, and what should be otherworldly comes clunking to the ground. </span></p></div>"|20069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20069-the-planet-ep/|6.5|Sasha Geffen

""For me, everything needs to have edges, corners and rough surfaces."" To that list, I'd add frayed wires, tarnished metal, and greasy ball bearings: whatever the Cologne DJ pulls out of her bag, from contemporary dance music to krautrock B-sides, tends to sound like it's been salvaged from a scrap heap. Maybe that battered, lived-in quality is related to the fact that everything she plays also needs to have a story—or at least, it tends to have one by the time she's done with it.</p>
<p>For her monthly Radio Cómeme show ""Sentimental Flashback"", Willikens puts together astonishingly diverse selections around themes both idiosyncratic and hyper-specific. One <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/RadioComeme/sentimental-flashback-01-radio-show-by-lena-willikens/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early show</a> spotlit ""the dark side of my record collection, focusing on the time period between '77 and '84""; she has gone on to make tributes to <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/RadioComeme/sentimental-flashback-02-radio-show-by-lena-willikens/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">female electronic music pioneers</a> like Delia Derbyshire and Daphne Oram; <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/RadioComeme/sentimental-flashback-07-radio-show-by-lena-willikens/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">West African music</a> from the '70s; <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/RadioComeme/sentimental-flashback-mise-en-place-14-radio-show-by-lena-willikens/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">minimal wave and post-punk</a>; and <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/RadioComeme/sentimental-flashback-10-radio-show-by-lena-willikens/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cosmic disco</a>, redefined. (""Do you remember? Some years ago there was a cosmic disco revival,"" she asked at the outset of the program. ""That time I asked myself what is cosmic? After listening to Baldelli's mixtapes, I think I've got the idea: play emotional, and fuck genre borders. I like that idea."") And while her club sets may not be as rigorously thematic, they are said to be every bit as daring; her residency at Düsseldorf's Salon des Amateurs has contributed to its reputation as one of dance music's most progressive venues.</p>
<p><i>Phantom Delia</i> is Willikens' debut EP. Co-produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/251-matias-aguayo/"">Matias Aguayo</a>, it's in line with the aesthetic of his label, Cómeme—dark but playful, modestly mid-fi but full of attitude—but this is clearly Willikens' show. She may have released little of her own music before now, but her aesthetic arrives fully formed. There are multiple inspirations audible here, but they all revolve around primitive electronics: there are the rudimentary thuds and drones of the early synth-pop known retrospectively as ""minimal wave,"" and there's the sultry machine sex of groups like Detroit's A Number of Names, of the foundational proto-techno single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLMGmJzp29Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sharevari""</a>. Towering above both styles is the figure of Delia Derbyshire, the record's presumable namesake, whose pioneering work for the BBC Radiophonic Workshop was enormously important in popularizing early electronic music. (Renowned for both her technological and artistic acumen, Derbyshire, who died in 2001, is also remembered as a feminist icon: upon graduating college, she applied to work at Decca Records, only to be told that they didn't hire women. That her music would go on to become so universally known, even if her name was not—who hasn't heard her theme for ""Dr. Who""?—feels like vindication, to say the least.)</p>
<p>""Howlin Lupus"" opens the record on an ominous note, as foghorn bleats tangle with wolf howls over typewriter clatter and minor-key throb. It's got it all, really: a danceable beat, a widescreen sense of drama, and rich, resonant sonics evocative of copper wires and glowing tubes. On ""Nilpferd""—that's German for ""hippopotamus""—detuned oscillators buzz and squeal while monotone muttering dissolves into deadpan laughter; it sounds like a bad trip in a concrete bunker, a real Cold War hangover. Her sound design comes to the fore on ""Asphalt Kobold"", in which plucked tones thumb-wrestle with synthetic mouth harp. At the center of it all, a glassy bauble of a rimshot sound stands out as if presented upon a velvet pillow; it suggests coldwave aesthetics as a pinnacle of electrical engineering, a feat of design comparable with Braun's legendarily sober, streamlined gizmos.</p>
<p>""Mari Ori"" is all hopped up on Halloween vibes; wind whistles through the cracks of its drum programming, and the tremolo lead shivers as though terrified. (It comes as no surprise to learn that Willikens also plays Theremin.) Even on her clubbiest tracks, her touch is distinct from virtually everyone else working in dance music; it has to do with the way she uses drums as accents rather than pulse-keeping devices. That's especially true on ""Noya Noya"" and ""Howlin Lupus"", with their stumbling kick drums and stabbing white noise. She's also got a real way with counterpoints, which she braids like pliable icicles, each strand chillier than the next—well, unless thawing's your chosen metaphor, in which case look to the slow dissolution of the beatless closing track, ""Phantom Delia"", a steady stream of sawtoothed frequencies seeping deep into the firmament. It is, after all, a kind of roots music—simply of a revisionist strain, bearing a mutant fruit that's been decades in the making.</p></div>"|20067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20067-phantom-delia-ep/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

Not every member of the Alternative Nation bled for their art, however. Behind the genre’s complicated stars were bands less interested in challenging the establishment than in just making cool noises with their guitars, acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3998-superchunk/"">Superchunk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29159-elastica/"">Elastica</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>. What these bands lacked in mystique, they made up for through sheer sonic abundance, amusing themselves with unfettered hooks, giddy tempos, and stylized riffing. With their fuzz-kicking guitars and modest attention spans, those bands serve as the guiding inspiration for the young Leeds group Menace Beach, whose full-length debut <i>Ratworld</i> bottles and concentrates the exuberance of that era's alterna-pop.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Menace Beach are in good company mining these sounds. Over the last few years the same intersection of early '90s alternative and indie-rock has inspired vital releases from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/"">Speedy Ortiz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30624-swearin/"">Swearin’</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31621-joanna-gruesome"">Joanna Gruesome</a>, but Menace Beach are even more committed to their specific set of influences than those groups. Their closest peers, in that sense, are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"">Yuck</a>, another band that's so fully internalized their record collection that their music becomes a form of roleplay. When singer/guitarist Ryan Needham merrily sings ""Fuck everything you ever wanted to be"" on <i>Ratworld</i> opener ""Come On Give Up""—flanked on backing vocals, as he almost always is, by his eager co-lead Liza Violet—he’s channeling every unassuming alt-rock singer who ever softened a barbed lyric with a chipper, slightly dweeby delivery. Casual self-loathing was just as much a part of the fabric of '90s alternative as whimsical tonal juxtapositions, and Menace Beach don’t shy from either.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like many of Leeds’ buzziest rock bands, Menace Beach have ties to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31499-hookworms/"">Hookworms</a> leader Matthew ""MJ"" Johnson, who produced their album at his increasingly busy Suburban Home Studios. Johnson also serves as a sometimes member of the band, but little of Hookworms’ psychedelic menace carries through <i>Ratworld</i>. The only hints come from the warped organs piped into ""Dig It Up"" and ""Fortune Teller"", and even those songs are so bombastically poppy that they go down easier than anything in Hookworms’ playbook. Johnson is smart to stay in the background, rather than risk interrupting the simple, sugary chemistry between Needham and Violet. They co-wrote the album together, and <i>Ratworld</i> reaches puppyish levels of excitement every time one of its choruses unites them. Theirs is the rare lead vocalist/backing vocalist dynamic that feels like an equal partnership, with Violet’s injections propelling these songs nearly as much as their rubbery bass lines or pogoing guitars.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Violet takes just one solo lead on <i>Ratworld</i>, and it’s the album’s biggest departure, a song so personal <a href=""http://www.rookiemag.com/2014/12/menace-beach-blue-eye/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she confided to <i>Rookie</i></a> its working title was ""This Is My Song"", because she didn’t want anybody else to hear it. It's the record’s one moment of true vulnerability, but like every song Menace Beach write, it’s also an homage, in this case to the smoldering, reverb-saddened ballads of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500"">Galaxie 500</a>. Here the familiarity that usually works in the band's favor cuts against them. When the song’s dreamy haze breaks into a shower of corroded guitars, there’s no surprise; that’s how these kinds of Galaxie 500 appropriations always play out. On an album that otherwise so joyfully captures the exhilaration of alternative's recent past, it's one of the rare moments where Menace Beach's borrowed sounds don't deliver the same charge they did the first time around.</p></div>"|20157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20157-ratworld/|7.1|Evan Rytlewski

Financial success seems harder and harder to come by and saying something new within the context of guitar based music might be even more difficult. Maybe you get to express yourself, but what if you think music should aspire to something other than being a vehicle for your feelings? You’ll probably just get compared to bands who ceased to exist two decades ago. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32165-viet-cong/"">Viet Cong</a> have clearly thought about this a lot in their brief period of existence, most of which has been spent relentlessly touring in support of last year’s introductory EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19495-viet-cong-cassette-ep/""><span class=""s1""><i>""Cassette""</i></span></a>. But don’t let the deadpan song titles like ""Pointless Experience"" and ""March of Progress"" throw you: the Calgary band’s self-titled debut projects unbridled passion, creativity, and possibilities while speaking in a presumably dead language of post-punk.</p>
<p>Their mission is not altogether different from that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26456-women"">Women</a>, the short-lived and sorely missed indie deconstructionists in which half of Viet Cong previously served. Women existed as a band that knew its impending expiration date, operating in secrecy and driven by entropy. Their albums felt like black boxes, reports of turbulence and panic captured on grimy tape in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4533-chad-vangaalen"">Chad VanGaalen</a>’s basement. They were statues during live performances, with the exception of their final show, which ended in a violent fist fight. If not necessarily a pop band on <i>""</i><i>Cassette""</i>, Viet Cong initially distinguished themselves with more extroverted, less intriguing impulses<span>—</span>there were snappy radio rock songs and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/307-bauhaus/"">Bauhaus</a> covers amongst the typically stonefaced gestures, things that would lead you to believe that the death of guitarist Chris Reimer at 26 might have dissuaded them from trying to carry the same heft of Women.</p>
<p>A year later, Viet Cong are a cohesive and confident unit that goes even further into inaccessibility than Women, confrontational in a way that reaches out to an audience rather than turning inward. The sound that begins <i>Viet Cong</i> most closely resembles someone trying to punch their way out of a coffin. The record ends with an 11-minute song called ""Death"". It is also a self-titled debut from a band named Viet Cong. So whether you’re familiar with their past or you’re just here because you’ve been hearing things about this band, everyone is getting the same first impression: That of a very serious rock record that won’t offer too many cuddly points of self-disclosure. So, in the moments where Viet Cong do reveal themselves, you might want to pay attention.</p>
<p>Two important instances occur during ""March of Progress"", <i>Viet Cong</i>’s astonishing six-minute centerpiece. Matt Flegel could be mocking the speculative nature of music criticism and predictable, tiresome process of ""proving"" one’s self in dazed, layered harmony: ""Your reputation is preceding you/ We’re all sufficiently impressed/ And this incessant march of progress/ Can guarantee our sure success."" It proves Viet Cong are self-aware, have a subzero sense of humor to match their environs, and recognize those two qualities might combine to give the impression that this isn’t music that is meant to be enjoyed. That’s when the double-time beat kicks in, and Viet Cong make a sprightly, major-key sprint towards a dead halt. There’s mastery of form, instrumental prowess, and on a record that thrives on unpredictability, ""March of Progress"" elicits the most unexpected response<span>—</span><i>that was fun</i>.</p>
<p><i>Viet Cong</i> is full of knowing moments and reference points<span>—</span>the fact that it could pass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices"">Guided by Voices</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17166-viet-cong-continental-shelf/"">""Continental Shelf""</a>), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"">Wolf Parade</a> (""Silhouettes""), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat"">This Heat</a> (take your pick) is enough of an accomplishment. It is not exactly a meta work, however. Viet Cong are just a band that’s unusually obsessed with the mechanics and process of their given trade. While their ashen sonics and rigid demeanor is liable to have them labeled as post-punk, they’re also industrial in a literal sense. Flegel’s vocals are those of a foreman, authoritative, commanding and prodding. Guitars often sound dissolved in caustic chemicals; instruments contort themselves and interlock to achieve forward momentum. It’s music that works very, very hard to express a perverse hometown pride you often see used to sell spring water or thermal outerwear <span>—</span>you might not want to brave Calgary’s bleak winters, but the way <i>Viet Cong </i>captures its forbidding chill and placid, sprawling beauty sure make it seem like a good place to be a post-punk band. </p>
<p>Most of all, this is a record of exertion, where the physical investment in live performance is meant to stimulate creativity, those demoralizing tours inspiring smarter use of the studio. Viet Cong’s favorite tactic of disorientation is inversion<span>—</span>laying high-register, melodic bass patterns over rhythmic, disassociated six string rubble, EQ’ing percussion so it sounds like a drum machine being run through a guitar amp. And Flegel’s most passionate vocal performances deliver his most disillusioned lyrics. <i>Viet Cong </i>has only seven tracks and more than half don’t pass the five minute mark. Yet all are <i>heavy</i>, ingenious contraptions.</p>
<p>This is also a record of conflict and contrast, in particular, a winter war. The sensations of Viet Cong are specific to being bundled up in the arctic, where one’s body feels suffocating warmth and blistering cold all at once. During ""Newspaper Spoons"", shrieking guitars morph into woozy synths, the effect is like watching a bloodied hand sink into a bucket of ice. There are many times when Viet Cong reveal psych-pop as their true north<span>—</span>clean guitars chime, harmonies are stacked in odd, almost madrigal-like forms, and Flegel’s lyrics favor surreal imagery of liquid gold, radiated primates and telepathically ""bending newspaper spoons."" But it’s psychedelia rendered in black and white; after three minutes of vertiginous percussion, a section of stereo-panned, autoharp-like riffs and stoned folk harmonies recall a grayscale <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective"">Animal Collective</a> ca. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/"">Feels</a></i>. Meanwhile, ""Continental Shelf"" flips <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen"">Echo and the Bunnymen</a>’s ""big music"", attempting to have the sky crash down to earth rather than reaching for it.</p>
<p>These are the kind of pleasures of which <i>Viet Cong</i> is composed; its emotions are otherwise proprietary to Flegel. Viet Cong do not write love songs, their politics are a mystery. They have no commentary on what it means to be alive in 2015. But to hear this kind of commitment to craft, particularly rock music that maintains the vibrancy and tension of four musicians playing instruments in the same room while testing its boundaries, Viet Cong questions what it means to care about the creation of art, if not necessarily its effect on its audience. Most of <i>Viet Cong</i> was written during a brutal tour across what the band described as ""shit earth"" that tested their resolve and was liable to make the same old question the center of discussion<span>—</span>why do this, <i>again</i>?</p>
<p><i>Viet Cong</i> is filled with moments that tap into the primal impulses of true post-punk<span>—think of </span>the first time someone puts together a couple of effects pedals and tries to make a guitar sound like something other than a guitar, of falling out with the sonic strictures of punk rock by embracing the philosophical freedom. Towards the end of ""March of Progress"", Flegel yelps, ""What is the difference between love and hate?"", and it can be taken as an allusion to the metaphysical conflict at its center; <i>Viet Cong </i>pits the romanticism of a newly enrolled philosophy major against the cynicism of the dropout who still hangs around the library to tell the fresh-faced youngsters it’s all bullshit. The album doesn't settle the argument, it's still as volatile and spirited as it was 30 years ago. The important thing is that people are still willing to have the conversation.</p></div>"|20086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20086-viet-cong/|8.5|Ian Cohen

""I think I had my peak and now I am coming down in relevancy,"" <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6443500/lupe-fiasco-tetsuo-youth-iggy-azalea-quitting-twitter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told <i>Billboard</i> recently</a>. ""It's not a sad thing for me...I can't compete with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a> for the attention of a 12-year old."" This doesn't make for inspiring promo copy, but there's no arguing that his run has been a wearying one: From 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9437-food-liquor/""><i>Food &amp; Liquor</i></a>, which suffered from leaks and a <i>Billboard</i> mishap <a href=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/statusainthood/2006/10/status_aint_hoo_17.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">misreporting his first-week sales</a>, to 2011's reviled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15208-lasers/""><i>Lasers</i></a>, which his fans had to storm Atlantic’s gates to get released, Lupe is forever swimming upstream, his hands tied behind his back. </p>
<p>Of course, many of Lupe's problems stem directly from Lupe—he was pointing out flaws in <i>F&amp;L</i> even before it was released, and he’s perennially signing off Twitter, announcing his retirement, scheduling and canceling albums. And yet something feels different this time around: If <i>Tetsuo &amp; Youth</i> is any indication, something has shaken loose in Lupe, because it's the most focused, thoughtful, and satisfying project he's offered since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11022-the-cool/""><i>The Cool</i></a>.</p>
<p>What’s shifted? Well, for one, the album serves as the end of his tortured contractual obligation to Atlantic. Even then, he wasn't let off the hook without a fight: Depending on whom you believe, the world might owe <i>Tetsuo</i>'s existence to the hacker group Anonymous, which <a href=""http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2014/10/did_anonymous_force_a_release_date_for_lupe_fiascos_tetsuo_youth_album.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">publicly threatened Atlantic</a> if the album was not given a release date. The label's official announcement came swiftly afterwards, and Lupe tweeted a simple ""V"" as a wordless gesture of thanks.</p>
<p>Whatever set the stage for him, he dives back into rapping for its own sake like it's a big dusty novel he's been waiting to pick back up for years. He opens after an intro track with ""Mural"", which lets him rap, endlessly, for nine minutes, with no hook. He remembers browsing his brother’s porn stash and contemplating the back pages, where you could find ""ad space for rubber girls."" He poses enigmatic rhetorical questions like ""Now what’s a coffin with a scratched ceiling?"" The question has no specific meaning, but the image, and its ghoulish riddle formulation, makes you ponder a lurid scenario for a half-beat longer so that it sinks in.</p>
<p>Fiasco has talked about his love of painting (he painted the album’s cover), and his way with language has always felt painterly rather than writerly, more concerned with how one word shades the next than with literal coherence. The words sound and feel gorgeous, and <i>Tetsuo &amp; Youth</i> bursts with ripe, beautiful lines, like ""Sanskrit dance on the page of the dead book,"" from ""Body of Work"", or ""High as the angel on Dikembe’s shoulder"" from ""They.Resurrect.Over.New"". Following his darting thoughts has always been a thrill, and <i>Tetsuo</i> is a gratifyingly clear transmission.</p>
<p>His longer, more ambitious gambits connect, too, mostly because they preach to no one. He has earned a reputation for sermonizing, but his best songs, like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPiKKfcjI-4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hip-Hop Saved My Life""</a>, eschew sermons for empathy: Even the KKK member he namechecked on on <i>F&amp;L</i>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Y_rJhjCLM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""American Terrorist""</a>, who ""can't burn his cross because he can't afford the gasoline,"" was worthy of pathos. On <i>Tetsuo</i>'s ""Prisoner 1 &amp; 2"", Lupe examines the prison-industrial complex, wriggling his way into multiple characters' heads, including the prison guard who has to work at the prison ""or it's no lights"" and feels a pang of jealousy every time a prisoner walks out. On ""Deliver"", a pizza delivery car serves as a metaphorical vehicle to explore neglected neighborhoods and the semi-mythical status of ""the hood."" Neither song hits a single strident, or forced, note.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same weakness that always hobbles Lupe albums—namely, the music—continues to dog him here. His in-house production team consistently surrounds him with a flavorless, vaguely rock-derived backing, while hook singers like ""Australian Idol"" winner Guy Sebastian and St. Paul singer/songwriter Nikki Jean croon the anonymous choruses. The placid, flat-footed rhythm is a poor match for Lupe's lively, elastic flow. Ironically, one of his recent ""label concession"" singles, the spry Ty Dolla $ign-featuring ""Next to It"", would have livened up the album's sound considerably. It's not on here, leaving Lupe in his own universe. It’s a pleasant place, but often a little flat.</p>
<p>Lupe has always been most exciting when he's somewhere outside his comfort zone, engaging directly with the commercial-rap epicenter he criticizes so shrewdly. He has a naturally subversive mind, but a subversive working outside the mainstream has very little to examine or tweak, and he's thrilling when he’s wriggling on the hook of a big, fat, contradiction—pushing against his audience’s idea of him with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/615-bun-b/"">Bun B</a>'s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjPA-m4SUg0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Swang on 'Em""</a>, for instance, or grappling with magnetism of rap cliches on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDuNxl_GtqY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Daydreamin'""</a>. ""Chopper"", produced by DJ Dahi, pairs Lupe with Trae tha Truth, Billy Blue, Buk of Psychodrama, Trouble, Fam-Lay, and Glasses Malone, a never-to-be-repeated line-up and a ferocious standout.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes when Lupe engages with the mainstream, you get strident messes like <i>Lasers</i>' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22l1sf5JZD0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Words I Never Said""</a>. You just never know. He's mercurial, as likely to strike gold on an obviously corporate-mandated single or an inward-burrowing indulgence. It’s tough to imagine his best-case scenario for creating: He always seems to be interrupting himself mid-sentence. In a recent <i>New Yorker</i> profile of Chris Rock, hip-hop critic and author Nelson George affectionately dubbed Rock the ""Duke of Doubt,"" pinpointing the skepticism that makes Chris Rock’s comedy hardy and evergreen. If Lupe has a similar wellspring, it is ambivalence. It's a tricky muse, but every Lupe project has found a way to harness at least 15 or 20 minutes of his fluid, fleeting mind. <i>Tetsuo &amp; Youth</i> is the most generous gulp he's managed in years.</p></div>"|20133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20133-tetsuo-youth/|7.2|Jayson Greene

Robert Forster and Grant McLennan met as teenaged boys at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, as Forster explains in the book that's the centerpiece of this anthology of their first seven years together. (His 70-page history of that period is written in the third person; count on the Go-Betweens for a touch of the impersonal where it's least expected.) They had their own ideas of what pop might be, and especially of what Australian pop might be. The very end of the book names their influences: Abba, Bowie, Creedence, Dolenz, Easybeats, Fellini, and then themselves.</p>
<p>The two of them bonded over their enthusiasm for film and literature at least as much as they did over music. Young men of that era didn't become filmmakers or novelists together, because that couldn't yield <i>Jules et Jim</i>, so Forster taught McLennan how to play guitar, and they started the group. (Forster described their partnership as ""platonic homosexuality."") Between 1978 and 1989, they made a small mountain of records but never made much of a ripple commercially; their 2000-2006 reunion was cut short by McLennan's death. Forster's essay, though, disputes the received wisdom that they ""were 'unsuccessful' and had little luck. It is a view Forster and McLennan never shared, having taken a two-piece Brisbane bedroom band out to the world.""</p>
<p>The Go-Betweens have tried to organize and reassess their chaotic early period a few times now: There have been a few greatest-hits sets, 1985's semi-bootlegged <i>Very Quick on the Eye</i>, 1999's <i>'78 Til '79: The Lost Album</i>, the expanded 2002 reissues of their early albums. <i>G Stands for Go-Betweens</i> includes new vinyl remasters of <i>Send Me a Lullaby</i> (1982), <i>Before Hollywood</i> (1983) and <i>Spring Hill Fair</i> (1984), and an LP called <i>The First Five Singles</i>, which is just that. There are also four CDs: three discs' worth of demos, compilation tracks, B-sides and oddities, and a live set from April, 1982, which features a few songs that mutated or disappeared before they could be recorded. This is, in other words, aimed at Go-Betweens superfans, but most of their fans were always superfans anyway.</p>
<p>They were a singles band more than they tended to let on—a lot of their songs are best experienced one or two at a time. <i>The First Five Singles</i>, released one a year from 1978 to 1982, is the most immediately delightful of these eight discs, although the very early Go-Betweens were callow, awkward, and a little uncomfortable with women, in the way that bookish young men can be. Both sides of their first single are paeans to unattainable women, one of them Lee Remick and the other a librarian who ""helps me find Genet, helps me find Brecht, helps me find Chandler... she's my god, she's my G-O-D."" ""People Say"", from 1979, is a homemade homage to the garage singles of a dozen years earlier; the next year's skittish ""I Need Two Heads"" made them the only non-Scottish band to release music on Postcard Records, thanks to a trip to the UK whose charming details Forster explains in the book.</p>
<p>Forster has noted that people shouldn't buy the Go-Betweens' first album ""without at least owning three others,"" and he's probably right. (The 1999 Go-Betweens retrospective <i>Bellavista Terrace</i> didn't include anything from it.) <i>Send Me a Lullaby—</i>the LP included here is the 12-song British version that came out in early 1982, rather than the eight-song 1981 Australian version—is the kind of arch, dry post-punk that sat itchily next to, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1396-essential-logic/"">Essential Logic</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/722-james-chance/"">James Chance</a> records (the occasional blurts of James Freud's saxophone are a reminder that that was the flavor of the underground at that particular moment).</p>
<p>Forster and McLennan weren't yet comfortable with their voices; ""Midnight to Neon"" sounds like Forster wasn't even sure how its melody was supposed to go. <i>Lullaby</i>'s main contribution to the band's history is introducing drummer/occasional vocalist Lindy Morrison, who was also dating Forster at the time, and who would be the backbone of the band until the end of its first incarnation in 1989. Morrison was never a showy musician, but she gracefully navigated the eccentric rhythms and time signatures that were starting to appear in both songwriters' work.</p>
<p><i>Before Hollywood</i> from 1983 was the first time the Go-Betweens really sounded like they would for the rest of their initial run: a little bit off to the side of the pop mainstream's commercial-alternative tributary, looking skeptically at it as it rushed alongside them. The distinction between Forster's writing (acidic, bristling) and McLennan's (tender, playful) was starting to become clearer; McLennan's first real jewel of a song, ""Cattle and Cane"", is a self-consciously poetic reminiscence of his youth, set to a gorgeous mesh of acoustic and electric guitar tones in 11/8 time; Forster's songs are the album's tougher rockers, especially ""By Chance"", which sounds more than a bit like the early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">Smiths</a> (both bands were releasing records on Rough Trade at the time).</p>
<p>By the time they made 1984's <i>Spring Hill Fair</i>, on which McLennan switched to guitar and Robert Vickers, who'd met them at their first show, took over on bass, the Go-Betweens had apparently made peace with prettiness. Its single ""Bachelor Kisses"" was McLennan's sweetest-sounding song yet—although, naturally, its lyrics bit harder than his delivery suggested. The band's reach still exceeded its grasp sometimes, and their stabs at funk and spoken-word <i>vers libre</i> are stumbles (although not disasters); a remake of the ""Man O' Sand to Girl O' Sea"" single doesn't match the frantic nervousness of the original. But you can also hear them successfully assimilating what they'd picked up through their engagement with other people's music. ""The Old Way Out"" is effectively the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">Fall</a> translated into the Go-Betweens' own idiom, and Forster's ""Part Company"" is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>'s <i>Blood on the Tracks</i> refracted through Australian rehearsal room windows.</p>
<p>Dylan's idea of a ""thin wild mercury sound"" was an obvious ancestor of what McLennan and Forster had called ""that striped sunlight sound,"" a phrase from the sleeve of their first single that reappeared as the title of their 2005 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3480-that-striped-sunlight-sound/"">live album</a>. You don't come up with something like that unless you're very interested in figuring out how to mythologize yourself. But why shouldn't they have? The Go-Betweens' endless enthusiasm for their own work is what propelled them out of that Brisbane bedroom in the first place, and the richness of context that this box provides makes it a deeper pleasure than its component albums are on their own.</p>
<p>The first 600 copies of <i>G Stands for Go-Betweens: Volume 1</i> also features a bonus book: a volume from McLennan's own book collection. (Domino has hinted that there are another 1200 books in reserve for follow-up collections.) That's entirely appropriate for them in a way that it wouldn't have been for nearly anyone else. There may have never been a more bookish great band than the Go-Betweens, and their career had a lot less to do with the kind of massive pop-cultural success that usually engenders comprehensive boxed-set histories than it did with precious artifacts passed from one fan to another.</p></div>"|19958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19958-g-stands-for-go-betweens-volume-1-1978-1984/|8.2|Douglas Wolk

It’s a high, boyish wail first attributed to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2688-doug-martsch"">Doug Martsch</a> and later mainstreamed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6859-james-mercer"">James Mercer </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6993-ben-bridwell"">Ben Bridwell</a>. And Ciolek isn’t trying to sidestep those warranted comparisons on the Sidekicks’ new record <i>Runners in the Nerved World</i>. In fact, the Cleveland, Ohio, band are welcoming them in the most obvious way by working with Phil Ek, a guy who has not coincidentally produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill"">Built to Spill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins"">the Shins</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/632-band-of-horses"">Band of Horses</a>. There’s a nature vs. nurture question going on with this style, as all four of these guys make music that perfectly aligns with their natural tone—it’s suburban operatic, a small voice for big spaces, giving the outer appearance of rumpled, hands-in-pockets meekness but having arena-ready expanse and resonance. None of them are from major media centers and that informs the distinct kind of restlessness implied twice over in the title of <i>Runners in the Nerved World</i>: It’s by and for adults looking at open fields, vast stretches of highway, or commercial sprawl and still feeling trapped in their own heads.</p>
<p>This is almost an exact repeat of what labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32348-joyce-manor/"">Joyce Manor</a> experienced on last July’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19507-joyce-manor-never-hungover-again"">Never Hungover Again</a>. </i>After a couple of albums established them as a clear cut above their local scene, both made the jump to Epitaph and got a big-name producer involved. By 2012’s <a href=""http://sidekicksohio.bandcamp.com/album/awkward-breeds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Awkward Breeds</i></a>, the Sidekicks were punk rock in ethics only, but their angsty beginnings still subjected them to the same ol’ tired comments about alienating their fans from the basement days. And the risk is in how Sidekicks are <i>also</i> transitioning into a keening, melodic, and heartfelt style that hasn’t produced a major new act in a very, very long time—""centrist"" indie rock when guitars aren’t necessarily at the center of discussion.</p>
<p>While <i>Runners</i> lacks <i>Never Hungover Again</i>’s consistency and melodic generosity, it likewise functions under the assumption that its new audience might be an anachronism, but it’s one worth chasing: people who value <i>the album</i> not so much as a cohesive, continuous 40-minute piece of music but one where every song justifies the act and trust of spending $10 for the whole. With the exception of the brief, fluttering closer ""All Things Run"", everything could be the ""single""<span>—the </span>Sidekicks are beholden to huge choruses with carefully constructed lead-ins, warm harmonies, and quotable lyrics about relatable topics. Remove the crusty production from their past work and nothing here should be a major surprise; it’s just more polished in every way, the melodies are less jittery, the dynamics are more pronounced, the presentation is immaculate.</p>
<p>Still, it’s easy to be bowled over by the broad strokes of the first two songs the Sidekicks let go from <i>Runners</i>. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpSONTxXdQo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jesus Christ Supermalls""</a>, from its title on down, is grandiose festival music, weeping guitar lines descending with the speed of an exhausted exhale while Ciolek’s voice beams like a klieg light, hitting the highest possible notes during a desperate chorus. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IQG7lBrqtc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Deer""</a> is more sedate and somehow even more startling for its hearty offering of strummy Midwestern roots-rock with Ciolek’s voice constantly in close harmony with itself. In other words, it sounds exactly like Band of Horses, but the kind we haven’t heard since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10757-cease-to-begin""><i>Cease to Begin</i></a>, not the corndoggin’ county fair stuff of recent vintage; it's a void well worth filling.</p>
<p>""Jesus Christ Supermalls"" and ""Deer"" aren’t exactly outliers, so Sidekicks’ ability to maintain both the velocity and direct lyricism of their past keeps <i>Runners in the Nerved World</i> from being an unintentional 10-year anniversary celebration of indie rock’s ""O.C."" era. Whereas most of the Sidekicks’ comparisons are often framed as an accessory to being a thoughtful, sensitive adult trying to find one’s place in the world, <i>Runners in the Nerved World</i> actually speaks on living that situation<span>—</span>the contrast between Ciolek’s embittered, specific lyrics and a sound that isn’t accustomed to those sort of things doesn’t make Sidekicks a particularly innovative band, but one with a distinct voice nonetheless.</p>
<p>Fittingly, a record meant as a musical transition out of the regional punk scene is stocked with lyrics that are often about just that<span>—</span>Ciolek writes as someone who’s ascended to a level where his peers might want to take shots at him, but still low enough where they can reach him. <i>Runners</i> finds heavy symbolism in the mundane<span>—</span>during ""Century Schoolbook Grown-Ups"", the font on merch buttons lets Ciolek know his friends have turned on him, while ""Everything in Twos"" bristles with the anxiety of watching everyone around you pair off while your own relationship falls apart. ""Maybe if this bed could talk/ I think it’d say to get the fuck off,"" Ciolek sneers on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZYjY85HUAs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Summer Brings You Closer to Satan""</a>, a car-radio anthem for shut-ins. The process of writing ""Summer"" gets name-checked earlier on ""The Kid Who Broke His Wrist"", a masterfully structured song about exactly what the title promises. During its intro, Ciolek sings in a crystalline falsetto about the indignity of having to recuperate from physical writer's block at his parents’ house, before the band goes headlong into Britpop jangle wherein he’s resigned to an inability to, ""Cover up his marks/ His fated heart or really much of anything.""</p>
<p>Fittingly, the true throwback to Sidekicks’ formative years is a memory mashup of trying to recapture young lust. On ""Blissfield, MI"", Ciolek yelps, ""I feel like how the Bulls felt in '93/ I feel like how my head felt the last time you kissed me"", a line so dense with possible meanings that there has to be some serendipity in him picking that exact year and phrasing it that exact way. In June of 1993, Chicago won the NBA Championship. In October, Michael Jordan retired and left the Bulls a shell of themselves until he returned in 1995. So then, what does he mean by <i>last time</i>, a ""most recent"" or ""final"" kiss? Is this a positive recollection or something far more painful? Is he Michael Jordan, is he the ultimate sidekick Scottie Pippen, or does he think of both as people whose drive for greatness made them seem like sociopaths in civilian life? Or you might not ask any of that. <span>""</span>Blissfield, MI"", like most of <i>Runners in the Nerved World</i>, is such an effortlessly enjoyable listen that you can miss the tension and ambition emanating from a band that’s chasing greatness as an escape from being Midwestern also-rans.</p></div>"|20139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20139-runners-in-the-nerved-world/|7.4|Ian Cohen

His teenage neighbor pounded on his door as the flames spread, and he escaped. He seems okay, but it’s hard to ignore the impulse to view the incident as a harbinger of some greater metaphysical ill, a hint of cosmic misalignment that can only be communicated through the Based God. And though Young L, the mastermind of B’s old group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6954-the-pack/"">the Pack</a>, has been known for his video game bloops and indulgent bass throughout his nearly 10-year production discography, his music has turned inward, his larger-than-life productions hunching in on themselves, reflecting a preoccupied mind rather than a packed function. His latest mixtape, <i>Final Fantasy</i>, continues the melancholy path he’s been forging since 2013, one on which he’s never stopped to rest for too long. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s easy to forget, these days, that Lil B was never really the most essential member of the Pack. That honor went to Young L, the quartet’s in-house producer as well as a rapper, in whose home studio they recorded their first two mixtapes, the stuff that got them signed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6299-too-hort/"">Too $hort</a>. It’s clear he’s always been the idea guy, and his production choices shaped the Pack’s aesthetic: rubbery, hyphy-indebted knock, but looser, rougher, with enough empty space for sounds to vibrate off one another, in many ways an early glimpse at the turn-up efficiency of the minimal club sounds that have dominated not just West Coast rap but radio in general in recent years. Post-Pack, as Lil B has grown into his role as swag-rap shaman, Young L has quietly pursued his own solo career, and while he may not wield his influence as visibly as Lil B, he’s usually a couple steps ahead of the game.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Young L’s early 2010s solo projects were informed by video game sounds, Bay Area house party tunes, flat, bright, anime slickness, and an alien truther’s stoned commitment to cosmic unpredictability. Underwritten tapes like 2011’s <i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Young-L-DOMO-KUN-mixtape.203863.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DOMO-KUN</a></i> or 2012’s split with Soulja Boy, <i><a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/15981/soulja_boy_young_l_mario_domo_vs_the_world.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mario &amp; Domo Vs. the World</a></i>, were early success stories within the intersection of rap and EDM sounds. Raucous bangers like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSpXsk5vnW4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Loud Pockets""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75lmO2cdOqA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Gold Everything""</a>, with their destructive bass and glitchy video game bloops, beat EDM-trap at its own game, slightly ahead of guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"">TNGHT</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30453-baauer/"">Baauer</a>, and often with more finesse. But something snapped for Young L in 2013: he had his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/""><i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i></a> moment, or probably more accurately, he got older, hitting the point at which ""swag"" is no longer an appropriate response to the gamut of life experiences. His <i>YFGOD</i> mixtape explored neon-lit, night-driving cinematics, somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a>’s ""Robocop"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"">Justice</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10321-justice/""><i>†</i></a>, and the <i>Drive</i> soundtrack. Months later, on his <i>Convulsion</i> EP, he abandoned rap altogether and sunk into the murky melodrama of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a>-style instrumental beat-making, the most depressive stuff of his career.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Final Fantasy</i> isn’t as sharp of a departure as <i>Convulsion</i>—at the very least, it’s recognizably a rap tape—but it shares a similar headspace: anxious, bittersweet, nostalgic for something vague and possibly nonexistent. Over a concise seven tracks, Young L probes light-headed cloud-rap balladry, blown-out trap scuzz, and somber, liturgical R&amp;B. Its introductory suite traffics in the wistful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2051-imogen-heap/"">Imogen Heap</a>-core of many of Lil B’s most gut-wrenching Clams Casino collaborations, that unlikely sweet spot between swag rap and ""The O.C."" soundtrack. Things get more interesting from there: a pair of staggering, bottomless trap songs, ""Doors Open"" and ""U Know What I Mean"", provide counterpoints to long-standing allegations that Young L’s tepid rapping is dead weight to his innovative production. Tape highlight ""$ugar Ray"" wallows in last night’s pastel afterglow: over two-and-a-half minutes, L channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13733-pyramids/"">""Pyramids""</a> pimp waking up in a puddle of drool, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4873-dj-khaled/"">DJ Khaled</a> surveying his kingdom, <a href=""http://assets.noisey.com/content-images/article/the-best-songs-about-four-loko-ever-of-all-time/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-6-24-40-PM_vice_970x435.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unmoved</a> and with Four Loko in hand, in the ""I’m on One"" video, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24062-dj-screw/"">DJ Screw</a>’s <i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/DJ-Screw-Chapter-16-Late-Night-Fuckin-Yo-Bitch-mixtape.115647.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Late Night Fuckin’ Yo Bitch</a></i> tape. There’s the detached menace of ""Slam Dunk"", the tape-closing Lil B collaboration featuring the hardest based freestyle in recent memory, shouting out fellow Pack brother Stunnaman.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">None of this represents any sort of bigger-than-itself artistic statement, and it probably won’t stand the test of time, but all that’s besides the point. There’s been a planned obsolescence to Young L’s work from the very beginning, a byproduct of a music career inextricably tied to the Internet (""Vans"" would be nothing without Myspace). It’s a survival tactic for continued relevance as an independent artist whose music exists primarily in a digital space, and it’s perfectly suited for restless idea guys like Young L. These songs don’t need to exist for years down the road so much as they need to exist right now, in this specific moment, as snapshots of time, place, and mood, and then they need to move on. There’s no need to linger for too long—everything happens too fast for that. It’s no coincidence that Young L drifted away from explicitly West Coast sounds around the same time that stuff had begun to blow up nationally, thanks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"">YG</a>, and HBK Gang. For a guy like L, who doesn’t rely on music financially (he’s got a successful clothing line, <a href=""http://www.pinkdolphinonline.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pink Dolphin</a>), there’s no need to stress over the pursuit of hits or pump out 20-track mixtapes in hope that something sticks. He’s free to follow his impulses, no matter how ephemeral, and though it may not have rendered him the most visible of his Pack brethren, it’s resulting in the most reliably intriguing solo catalog. Young L’s sound may have evolved, but his strategy hasn’t: Set the trends, keep it moving, and watch the wave crest behind him.  </p></div>"|20154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20154-final-fantasy/|6.9|Meaghan Garvey

You’re tired all the time, but sleep doesn’t help; you can’t hold a job down, since you don’t have the energy to be anywhere. Murdoch developed the disease as a university student, when he was old enough to fully comprehend what he’d be forgoing should his symptoms endure. Family? The hope of fame, or fortune? Forget about it.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you imagine for a second how Murdoch must’ve despaired, then you’ll understand why he calls ""Nobody’s Empire""—the opener on </span><span><i>Girls in Peacetime Want to Danc</i>e</span><span>, in which he sings about the solitude brought on from his sickness—the most personal song he’s ever written. That’s not a small statement, considering Belle and Sebastian’s reputation. Their ethos was crystallized in the title of the first song on their first album—""The State I’m In""—and they’ve spent nearly two decades staking their claim as the most sensitive band in indie rock, patron saints for daydreaming boys and girls. Their early records sounded feather-soft, but over the years, they slowly put on weight and become a real band, translating their bedroom aesthetics for the festival set.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance</i>, they’ve added a new wrinkle by writing an album that attempts to be pop <i>qua </i>pop, filled with synthesizers and dance grooves to coax their once notoriously-staid live crowds to cut a rug. Even the artwork is different: This is their first cover that doesn’t use a monochromatic photographic still that directly references the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">Smiths</a>, their emotional forerunner. The band hired outside producer Ben H. Allen III (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a>) to punch up their sound, and he encouraged them to take more chances. The band is confident enough to step into pro forma P-funk on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57233-belle-and-sebastian-release-the-party-line/"" target=""_blank"">""The Party Line""</a> and polka singalong on ""The Everlasting Muse"" without losing their penchant for bookishness: ""The Power of Three"" name drops Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty, while the jaunty ""Play for Today"" mixes in chants of ""author! author!"" as Murdoch and Dee Dee Penny of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Dum Dum Girls</a> trade harmonies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Enter Sylvia Plath"" combines both worlds, with a brittle rhythmic backbone giving the band their first song that you might—</span><i>might</i><span>—hear in a club. ""The Cat With the Cream"" and ""Ever Had a Little Faith?"" are both classic Sebastian, softly spoken songs where Murdoch reminisces for rainy days and childhood wonder. The piano line that kicks in during the latter’s outro is a pleasant little melody that accentuates Murdoch’s ear for nostalgic detail. So does ""Nobody’s Empire"", which Murdoch wasn’t lying about. It’s a nakedly autobiographical song that’s verbose even by their standards, with Murdoch spitting rapid-fire verses over a sleepy melody before letting loose with what passes for a scream in the Sebastian-verse, which is a place filled with indoor voices.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In an interview <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/05/stuart-murdoch-s-god-help-the-girl-does-something-pretty-and-something-twee.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with the Daily Beast</a>, Murdoch said he would’ve loved to be ""a young Carole King,"" working in the Brill Building where so many of pop’s yesteryear hits were written. ""I see no reason why that music can’t be possible again, but I look around and don’t see it,"" he said. ""Sophisticated, nuanced, melodious pop music, that sweeps you away."" That Murdoch’s shining ideal of pop harkens back to a half-century ago goes hand-in-hand with a lot of the band’s dandier affectations, as does his casual dismissiveness of today’s comparatively hedonistic Top 40. It's also strange because, to many long time listeners, the band already took their shot at writing a pop album with 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/633-dear-catastrophe-waitress/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i></a> and 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/639-the-life-pursuit/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Life Pursuit</i></a>, where they churned out romantic hook-loaded singalongs like ""I'm a Cuckoo"" and ""The Blues Are Still Blue"", both of which are catchier and more memorable than anything on <i>Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance</i>. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Besides, Murdoch is surely trifling if he doesn't think sweeping, sophisticated pop has a place on the charts: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"" target=""_blank"">Adele</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Smith</a> are two singers who've carved their niche by singing right to your parents. A flippant comment <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/9580-belle-and-sebastians-stuart-murdoch/"" target=""_blank"">to Pitchfork</a> about how listeners would rather lose themselves in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5062-nina-simone/"" target=""_blank"">Nina Simone</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a> shows not just a flagrant misunderstanding of how people listen to Beyoncé, but to the artists they love. He means well, but it faintly stinks of snobbery that's gotten other indie acts in trouble when they've tried to explain their theory of pop with, well, a lot of theory. Tom Krell of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a> raised hackles when he told Pitchfork he wanted to be ""pop, but not populist."" But what's wrong with trying to appeal to as many people as possible? </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance </i>reminds me of another recent attempt from a high-profile indie band to change directions. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a> surprised fans with the Caribbean-influenced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18667-arcade-fire-reflektor/"" target=""_blank""><i>Reflektor</i></a>, their attempt at writing a looser, more playful album. They sort of looked like a bunch of dorks, but it didn't matter. Eventually, everyone learns what children and merengue instructors know to be true: Dancing is fun, regardless of how well you move your hips.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Look at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/31-pitchfork-music-festival-2013/870-belle-and-sebastian-im-a-cuckoo/"" target=""_blank"">the video</a> of the band cutting through ""I’m a Cuckoo"" from the 2013 Pitchfork Music Festival. Murdoch hams it up, casting flirtatious looks from side-to-side, dropping to his knees like Elvis. At one point, he loses the guitar, because you can’t dance while holding a guitar. He’s having fun. And if fun is what he wants to have after 19 years and nine albums anointing them as kings of coyness and crossed arms—it’s hard to begrudge that.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-4d93f033-ee40-dd19-c0a7-7ced0f4684b5"">And, who knows: Maybe this is the album to teach someone about fun. If not, it’s still a perfectly respectable hour of Northern soul-influenced pop, even if it’s difficult not to hear the intention behind every song. (Or to shake the feeling that a band like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5730-cut-copy/"" target=""_blank"">Cut Copy</a> is much better at this shambling soul revue style of music.) One of Murdoch’s imaginary women instructs him to ""be popular, play pop, and you will win my love"" on ""The Everlasting Muse"", which sounds like noble inspiration but ends up falling short. You don’t win anyone by simply playing a pop song, or by deciding to be pop. It takes something else, something that can’t be explained by a mission statement. For a band so well-loved for writing from their heart, it sounds like they got stuck in their head.</span></p></div>"|20135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20135-girls-in-peacetime-want-to-dance/|6.6|Jeremy Gordon

But no such fanfare exists for determining the Song of the Winter, an arguably more impressive achievement, given that it must seize our attention from the hectic pre-Christmas crunch through to the post-New Year’s onset of Seasonal Affective Disorder (and all the grueling family gatherings in between). Where Songs of the Summer are readymade soundtracks for the happiest moments of your life, Songs of the Winter must be scientifically engineered with enough exuberance to fire up your serotonin during the most miserable time of year. Lest we forget, some of the most universally embraced, monoculture-fortifying singles of this millennium—from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWgvGjAhvIw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hey Ya!""</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd2B6SjMh_w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Crazy""</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRMOMjCoR58"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Happy""</a>—all surfaced during the chilly season, making their outsized energy not just welcome, but psychologically necessary. And if 2014 was indeed <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30852588"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the hottest year on record</a>, we can thank ""Uptown Funk"" for raising the mercury during its dying days.</p>
<p>A year ago next month, Bruno Mars appeared at the Super Bowl half-time show in a rare, shared bill with Red Hot Chili Peppers—the implication being that, even with two multi-platinum albums under his belt, the singer was somehow still too young or unproven to carry the show on his own without the help of some rock veterans. But on the heels of ""Uptown Funk""—his inescapable, undeniable chart-topping collaboration with producer Mark Ronson—Mars could not only claim the show for himself this year, but make everyone in the stadium forget there was a football game going on. If ""Uptown Funk"" represents something of a supernova moment for Mars’ ascendant star—unleashing a braggadocio that’s several degrees sassier than what we’ve heard on his more congenially soulful solo hits—it’s a hard-fought moment of Stateside redemption for Ronson. Though his name can be found in the fine print on some of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10032-back-to-black/"">biggest</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_(Adele_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">British</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9221-alright-still/"">pop</a> records of the past decade, Ronson’s own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10299-version/"">collaboration-heavy</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14728-record-collection/"">albums</a> failed to establish the London-born producer as a star in his own right in his second home of America (where his sister Samantha is arguably more famous for being Lindsay Lohan’s long-time party pal). His productions for others have cracked the Billboard Top 10, but this time he has a monster hit to call his own—that is, if you discount <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/6327615/sugarhill-gang-to-trinidad-james-influences-mark-ronson-bruno-mars-uptown"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the veritable syllabus worth of '80s-funk sources</a> ""Uptown Funk"" so unapologetically references. Between the Morris Day-schooled mojo and Michelle Pfeiffer name-drops, all the song is missing for maximum period detail is an Eddie Murphy cop flick to soundtrack.</p>
<p>There’s more where that came from on <i>Uptown Special</i>—though not as much as you might think. Where last fall's ""SNL""-showcased double shot of ""Uptown Funk"" and its gloriously profane, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30944-mystikal/"">Mystikal</a>-manned counterpart ""Feel Right"" suggested <i>Uptown Special</i> would be Ronson’s star-studded reenactment of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuXK8ZbTmLk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Revolution</a>-vs.-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cimtmLVtChE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Time</a> First Avenue showdown, the album is actually more like a five-CD-changer shuffle through styles that dominated pop radio while Ronson was still a grade-schooler. Pieced together in several cities spanning Toronto to Memphis to L.A., the album represents something of a <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19864-foo-fighters-sonic-highways/"">Sonic Highways</a></i>-style journey for Ronson, and like Dave Grohl, the producer boasts both the chart-pop and alt-rock bona fides to attract luminaries from the mainstream and indie-verse alike. The guest list here includes everyone from a hall-of-fame legend like Stevie Wonder to an unknown choir singer, Keyone Starr, recruited from Mississippi State; from electro-pop pin-up Andrew Wyatt of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27863-miike-snow/"">Miike Snow</a> to reigning psych-rock king Kevin Parker of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"">Tame Impala</a>; from the guy who wrote <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</i> to the guy who wrote ""Shake Ya Ass"".</p>
<p>If Ronson’s previous albums were united by formalizing principles (retro-soul makeovers of alt-rock standards on 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10299-version/""><i>Version</i></a>, odd-couple duets on 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14728-record-collection/""><i>Record Collection</i></a>), his strategies on <i>Uptown Special</i> are more conceptual. For several songs, he enlisted novelist Michael Chabon to pen pulp-novel-like lyrical vignettes of crime and passion on the outskirts of Las Vegas and hipster identity crises in L.A., providing the album with, if not a linear narrative, then a recurring motif of dislocation. And in the spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>’s producer-cum-artist-album gold standard, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19148-todd-terje-its-album-time/"">It’s Album Time</a></i>, the tracklist follows a loose dusk-till-dawn trajectory, welcoming us in with Stevie’s signature harmonica squeals on the sunset-summoning intro ""Uptown’s First Finale"" before slipping into the cocktail-hour psychedelia of ""Summer Breaking"" (the first of Parker’s three leads). But before the album’s 15-minute mark, Mystikal has already gotten up and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwOFThiNnA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">offa that thing</a>, Mars has completed his one-and-done deal, and newcomer Starr has held her own with the jazzy, jittery R&amp;B of ""I Can’t Lose"", rendering <i>Uptown Special</i> as an album of all-too-brief, berserker highs followed by a protracted, increasingly ponderous comedown period. The problem isn’t that <i>Uptown Special</i>’s incongruous collaborators clash with one another, it’s that Ronson sounds like he’s mashing two entirely different albums—one libidinous, one languorous—together.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the scene-stealing performances that dominate the album’s first half, <i>Uptown Special</i>’s second act essentially sees Parker and Wyatt trading smooth soft-rock volleys overtop chill grooves, with refereeing from Jeff Bhasker (who plays the same role on ""In Case of Fire"" as Todd Edwards did on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWPFW3I7SzM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fragments of Time""</a>—i.e., a big-name producer making a rare vocal turn on a thinly veiled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan"">Steely Dan</a> tribute.) Parker’s contributions—be it the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"">Toro Y Moi</a>-style cosmic funk of ""Daffodils"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"">Ween</a>-like bounce of ""Leaving Loz Feliz""—provide a prophecy of what a tamer Tame Impala might sound like another five years down the road should they ever trade in heavy-duty guitar jams for streamlined pop; Wyatt’s ""Heavy and Rolling"" cops its strut from ""Billie Jean"" but none of its dramatic tension, denying <i>Uptown Special</i> the late-game climax it’s begging for. Before you know it, Stevie Wonder’s returned for the sunrise swirl of ""Crack in the Pearl, Pt. II"" to send us off with another unmistakably Stevie-esque harmonica line (while making you wonder why the hell Stevie Wonder isn’t doing anything more on this album other than playing harmonica). Too top-heavy to sustain its momentum, yet too fleeting for its thematic framework to cohere, <i>Uptown Special</i> is that rare beast: a concept album that actually could use more fat.</p></div>"|20121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20121-uptown-special/|6.0|Stuart Berman

Between 2001 and 2003, the Bay Area band toured consistently and released a slew of well-regarded singles and splits as well as two full albums, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2822-other-animals/""><i>Other Animals</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2820-at-crystal-palace/"">At Crystal Palace</a>.</i> Since the twitchy dancefloor ""post-riot-grrrl"" sound they specialized in was on the ascent at the time, there was a lot of hype, which brings with it naysayers and trendwatchers. With founding guitarist Sara Jaffe’s departure in 2004, the band took a couple of years to regroup, finally solidifying into trio form for 2006’s relatively under-the-radar LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9257-nightlife/"">Nightlife</a>. </i>On <i>Lost Weekend</i>, their first LP in nearly a decade and their first offering since 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15055-damaged/"">""Damaged""</a> single, they take a measured, deliberate approach, an acknowledgment of space and patience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Lost Weekend</i> is a short record, but it doesn’t feel rushed and it never feels labored. Erase Errata haven’t lost their ability as songwriters, the smart tack they developed over their discography of winding unexpected texture around sparse, jagged rhythmic structure. I hear bits of sonic reference to some underrated and unexpected post-punk predecessors here—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/20280-the-bush-tetras/"">Bush Tetras</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1212-disco-inferno/"">Disco Inferno</a>, Moonshake—but Erase Errata have eked out their own space here, grown into their own legacy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""In Death I Suffer"", one of the album's standouts, roils and rumbles its catchy rhythm over a chilly expanse of synth noise, out of which blooms a surprisingly hooky chorus. Guitarist Jenny Hoyston’s voice has become more understated over the years, and when she intones ""They came from all sides—all sides,"" it is one of those prickly-neck moments I didn’t need to fully understand intellectually in order to respond to.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lest anyone think <i>Lost Weekend</i> is all clouds and ice and gloom, the opening track, ""History of Handclaps"", is a sly, self-deprecating look back at the indie dancefloor culture in which Erase Errata found their voice and early fame, a scene where syncopated (and sometimes synthesized) handclaps became ubiquitous. The disco claps here are buried in the mix, only surfacing during the breakout chorus; the song is mainly propelled by Bianca Sparta’s nearly unbearably precise drumming and Ellie Erickson’s curdling bass. This is a band that has never forgotten the main tenet of post-punk: the genre is nothing if it doesn’t place most of its strength in its rhythm section. ""History of Handclaps"" isn’t snide, though—in its tracing of the sonic trend both lyrically and musically, it acknowledges both the overuse and humanity of the handclap through rock'n'roll, soul, disco, and punk.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Watch Your Language"" kicks and shudders, built around a blues riff; it’s a claustrophobic and intimate look at information-age communication (it also features a particularly judicious use of the flat, splattery sound of analog synths.) ""Galveston, Dark Tides"" might be the closest thing to a straightforward pop song Erase Errata have ever done. They’ve learned when to hustle and when to lay back, and <i>Lost Weekend</i> is a good marker that if Erase Errata wants, they could have a career as long and as consistent as a band like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1378-the-ex/"">the Ex</a> (who have had said kind things about Erase Errata), post-punk stalwarts who are over 30 years old at this point and over 20 albums deep. This band is leaning into their stride, picking up the wind, challenging all those flash-in-the-pan expectations from over a decade ago with solid work.</p></div>"|20136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20136-lost-weekend/|7.6|Jes Skolnik

Take ""Slow Time Vultures"", the 7-1/2-minute centerpiece of his <a href=""Western%20Vinyl"">Western Vinyl</a> debut <i>Where in Our Woods</i>, which describes the time O’Connell’s childhood home in Pekin, Indiana, attracted a giant flock of vultures. The song anthropomorphizes the birds, who use the barn roof as a soapbox to lament Indiana’s conforming to Daylight Savings Time. (Prior to 2006, most of the state disregarded DST, and locals often referred to its singular zone as ""slow time."")</p>
<p>The vultures question and criticize fast-paced progress (""We can’t afford to go forward any more""), and O’Connell sanctifies their words in a sparse, patient arrangement. It takes about 20 seconds for him to sing the first six words—""Vultures on our old barn roof""—and he spends much of the song hypnotically plucking the low E of a nylon-stringed guitar that permeates the album, becoming its signature instrument. The effect is stark and haunting and entirely vulture friendly.</p>
<p>O’Connell has been experimenting with Midwestern Americana for 14 years now, but most of the 11 Elephant Micah releases prior to <i>Where in Our Woods</i> were primitively recorded and distributed on tiny labels or self-released on CD-Rs. Elephant Micah isn’t exactly a secret (you can find most of the releases for pay-what-you-want prices on <a href=""http://productofpalmyra.elephantmicah.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a>), but O’Connell has remained on the margins more than friends like M.C. Taylor of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30386-hiss-golden-messenger/"">Hiss Golden Messenger</a> (the two covered each other’s songs for a <a href=""http://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/hiss-golden-messenger-plays-elephant-micah-plays-hiss-golden-messenger-7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">7'' release</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> a few years ago). All that, plus the folklorist thing, has contributed to Elephant Micah’s outsider/not-of-this-time rep. You get the feeling O’Connell doesn’t get worked up about iTunes updates or the appropriate context for leggings.</span></p>
<p>If 2012’s <i>Louder Than Thou</i> refined the Elephant Micah sound, <i>Where in Our Woods</i> continues the distillation until, after stripping away all but guitar, voice, a pump organ, and some rumbling drums (courtesy of O’Connell’s brother Matthew), the minimalism becomes the album’s calling card (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/"">Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy</a>’s unadorned but crisply rendered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/698-master-and-everyone/""><i>Master and Everyone</i></a>). The album isn’t so decorous that it doesn’t take chances, though. It’s a risk, in fact, to present O’Connell’s voice so nakedly, since it’s neither a showstopper nor terribly eccentric. He doesn’t whisper, doesn’t yell. It’s smooth, almost to a fault, but the clarity of his tenor fits the pace and spareness of these eight songs. And just when you start yearning for something more, the bonnie prince himself, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a>—an obvious inspiration here—shows up to add some harmonies.</p>
<p>Often, folk singers are either storytellers or read-into-it-what-you-want poets, but some of this generation’s best (Oldham, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26175-songs-ohia/"">Jason Molina</a>) fall somewhere in the middle. Elephant Micah stands firmly in that middle ground, not shying away from small details nor lofty, ambiguous ideas. Without some background explanation, it would be impossible to know that ""Demise of the Bible Birds"" refers to an Indiana man who trained birds to perform Christian-themed tricks. Or that O’Connell ripped the three stories in the gorgeous ""Albino Animals""—hunters killing an albino deer, athletes capsizing on a boat, and meth cooks avoiding prosecution for a trailer fire—from the headlines of his hometown newspaper. O’Connell, though, gives us all the details we need to ponder ignorance and the unknowability of life while falling under the spell of a bewitching, repeating guitar line that somehow communicates both the tragedy and mercy in the stories.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Where in Our Woods</i> were all written in 2006 and 2007, and while the Elephant Micah albums of that period have an experimental, homespun charm to them, O’Connell was wise to set these songs aside until he found the right setting for them, even if that didn’t become clear for several years. As the slow time vultures sing, ""Ours are the spoils and the things that we can find on our own time."" Maybe those birds are onto something.</p></div>"|20082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20082-where-in-our-woods/|7.6|Joel Oliphint

It is a backstory that makes sense in hindsight upon hearing their minimally arranged, moderately morose, and maximally loud debut LP </span><i>Further Out. </i>Cloakroom know from heavy machinery; the operative terms for <i>Further Out</i> are ""bulldoze,"" ""steamroll."" <a href=""http://cdn.stereogum.com/files/2014/11/cloakroom-band-608x608.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here’s a picture of the band</a>—Brian Busch is on the left and the drums on <i>Further Out</i> sure sound like they’re being hit by a guy who has 100-litre barrels for arms. Meanwhile, Doyle Martin valiantly keeps up with all the might his lanky, mortal frame can bear, as <i>Further Out</i> comes off like the only indie rock album released in 2015 actively gunning for its own tablature book. Opener ""Paperweight"" sums up Martin’s sedentary, sarcastic point of view (""You exist in material states/ One part paper, one part weight/ You could not decide what force is holding you down today"") and empties his arsenal of bullying power chords, fluid, clean arpeggios, melodic fills and narcotized acoustic strums.</p>
<p>All of the aforementioned provide for a wealth of hooks throughout <i>Further Out</i>, even if it’s an album for the gearheads who’d rather spend time and money assessing amplifier nuance than effects pedals. Proudly analog from the recording to the vinyl pressing, <i>Further Out </i>utilizes a mere handful of tones because Martin took like two years to get these settings <i>just</i> right: his favorite is a super-saturated buzz that somehow sounds both impenetrable and like it could dissolve on contact. It’s a shame someone else beat Cloakroom to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19912-luke-wyatt-lets-cry-and-do-pushups-at-the-same-time""><i>Let’s Cry and Do Pushups at the Same Time</i></a> as an album title, as <i>Further Out</i> is equal parts thick muscle and lactic acid.</p>
<p>The result is a record heavy enough to justify a 2xLP pressing even with a relatively brief 45 minute runtime. It’s probably best for the vinyl considering the contents: ""Paperweight"" inherits the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27524-the-secret-machines"">Secret Machines</a>’ ambitions to recreate Texas-sized arena boogie that’s part <i>Slacker</i>, part <i>Dazed and Confused</i>, ""Lossed Over"" and ""Moon Funeral"" are the basis for the pop record to which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu"">Jesu</a> refused to commit, while ""Outta Spite"" and ""Starchild Skull"" hulk boxes upon boxes of CDs from the time when indie rock went alt and cast a lot of truly great bands as one-hit wonders stashed in the Buzz Bin. Most specifically, Hum<span>—</span><i>Further Ou</i><i>t</i> was recorded in <a href=""http://www.earthanalog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matt Talbott’s studio</a> and his former band would be a reference point even if had no direct involvement. Hum have become a kind of shorthand for contemporaries like Cloakroom who draw from but are not limited to shoegaze, slowcore, alt-rock, emo, basically all forms of music that favor distorted guitars and never really have their ""moment"" in indie rock post-1995.</p>
<p>But for that reason, they also never really go out of style. <i>Further Out</i> does successfully sound genreless despite being referential of a half dozen genres at once and is presented as a continuous listening experience. Though Cloakroom might be selling themselves short in the interest of cohesion<span>—""</span>Mesmer"" and ""Sylph"" are meant as instrumental interludes, but their skittering rhythms and timbral beauty are such intriguing divergences from the consistent piledriving that they feel like unkept promises; one wishes they could’ve been extended into vocal tracks. But in light of the effort and exertion required of <i>Further Out</i>’s eight other songs, perhaps that was too much of an undertaking for the time being.</p>
<p>All of the deliberate aggression in Cloakroom's music is a none-too-subtle defense mechanism for the implacable depression at its core. Martin’s yawning moan is a dead ringer for that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3273-pedro-the-lion"">Pedro the Lion</a>’s David Bazan, somehow managing to emerge clean and clear from the murk despite him never raising his voice. But unlike Bazan, Martin’s pen is caked with bong resin rather than poison. Cashed bowls and empty cans litter <i>Further Out</i>, having served as coping mechanisms rather than means of escape. All of these low-level narcotics have a way of muddling situations as Martin attempts to explain his disappointment in people who continue to fail him. At any given point, it’s unclear whether he’s addressing a girlfriend, a friend, a coworker, a parent, the mailman, whoever.</p>
<p>Most likely, it’s himself, but his lethargic delivery becomes a part of the hook: on ""Asymmetrical"", Martin describes suburban, drunken intransigence as a night out where he, ""Took a long drive/ Got a few dents/ Told a couple jokes at your expense""; the major-key melody appears to be mocking the target, as Martin’s words drip with both dejection and derision, a perfect match of content and delivery.</p>
<p>Cloakroom once described themselves as ""stoner emo"" as a joke and they’ll probably spend the rest of their career getting shit for it. It’s <i>clearly</i> meant as a joke, the punchline being the obvious incompatibility of its two parts. The latter is defined by anxious rhythms, a tenuous connection to straight edge, brazen, high-register melodies and a desperate desire for human connection amidst a litany of misunderstanding and communication failures. Meanwhile, a band named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a> made one of stoner rock’s formative documents, which just so happens to be called <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16601-dopesmoker"">Dopesmoker</a></i> and sounds exactly like what you think it does. To the extent that their turbid, somewhat timid debut EP <i>Infinity</i> couldn’t achieve, <i>Further Out</i> presents those genres existing as a continuum rather than in conflict: Cloakroom are driven by a distinct Midwestern despair and disillusion, they just don’t make music that reflects it. Instead, they hit a very specific catharsis wrung from exhaustion; at a certain point, you’ve earned your place on the couch after a hard day at the factory, the office, or just enduring a line at the grocery store, and you figure you may as well just spark up and crank up the amps.</p>

Ever since, we have had Corin Tucker, Carrie Brownstein, and Janet Weiss to soundtrack our societal chaos and <a href=""https://twitter.com/feministabulous/status/471638329587679233/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">progressing</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53563-read-beyonces-essay-on-gender-equality/"" target=""_blank"">zeitgeist</a>: tangled agitation, pummeled norms, principled wit, sublimity, sadness, friction, kicks.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nowadays, there is a prevailing notion that we ought not want such epochal bands as Sleater-Kinney to reunite, because why tarnish the legend of <a href=""http://www.esquire.com/features/man-at-his-best/Best-Band-Culture-0499"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Best Band in the World""</a> acclaim and a perfectly ascendant seven-album streak? But if any band in the past two decades has proved they've got the intellect, skepticism, and emotional capacity to deserve this—to keep living—it's Sleater-Kinney. <i>No Cities to Love</i> is a disarming, liberationist force befitting the Sleater-Kinney canon. Fervent political leftism has been implicit to this Olympia-born trio since they first inverted <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=540hqevOEbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boston's ""More Than a Feeling""</a> on a 1994 comp and that goes on here as well; we desperately need it. It is astonishing that a radical DIY punk band could grow up and keep going with this much dignity and this many impossibly chiseled choruses. No Pistol, Ramone, or unfortunate mutation of Black Flag could have done this.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-68e1b37b-f358-ac5b-742b-31b62d705afa"">The necessity of change—the creative virtue of ripping it up and starting again—remains a crucial strand of Sleater-Kinney's DNA. This is still them: low-tuned classic rock tropes resuscitated with punk urgency, raw and jagged like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> compressing crystalline <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11853-marquee-moon-adventure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Marquee Moon</i></a> coils. Weiss' massive swoop is still the band's throbbing heart, pumping Sleater-Kinney's blood. But Brownstein has said they set out to find ""a new approach to the band"" and that is true of <i>No Cities to Love</i>. It is no less emphatic and corporeal than punk classics <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19860-sleater-kinney-start-together/"" target=""_blank""><i>Call the Doctor</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19860-sleater-kinney-start-together/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dig Me Out</i></a>. But unlike their last two albums of monstrous combat rock, <i>No Cities to Love </i>keeps only the most addictive elements—if Sleater-Kinney <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPs2RTFybIg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>are still</span></a> taking <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHpfZhfQbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Joey Ramone as a spiritual guide</span></a>, this is their mature, honed, and clean-sounding <i>Rocket to Russia.</i> Catchy as all-clashing hell, it's Sleater-Kinney's most front-to-back accessible album, amping their omnipresent love of new wave pop with aerodynamic choruses that reel and reel, enormously shouted and gasped and sung with a dead-cool drawl. The album has the particular aliveness of music being created and torn from a group at this very moment—tempered, but with the wild-paced abandon that comes with being caged and then free.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>As ever, empathy is Sleater-Kinney's renewable energy source. They have always made a kind of folk music—songs of real people—and<i> </i>opener ""Price Tag"" is an honest example of this, fueled by Tucker's motherly responsibility. In concrete detail, it describes the struggle of a working class family in the context of American capitalism and financial crisis (it rings of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wal-Mart:_The_High_Cost_of_Low_Price"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">high cost of low prices</a>). Real life power dynamics permeate <i>No Cities</i>, among the rubbery synth lines of the otherwise venomous ""Fangless"" (which I know will frighten off a couple to-the-bone punk purists, like garlic wards off evil) and the anxious post-hardcore lurch of ""No Anthems"", which Albini could have produced. On the glammy ""Gimme Love"", Tucker plainly wants more of that four-letter-word for girls and outsiders (she seems to wish, in the words of de Beauvoir, ""that every human life might be pure transparent freedom""). Brownstein, meanwhile, sings some of the most elliptical and oblique lyrics of her career: ""I was lured by the devil... I'll choose sin 'til I leave,"" she hollers like a Bad Seed, clenched and possessed. In lighter moments, it's heartening to hear Tucker and Brownstein in unison at the record's sing-song center: </span>""No outline will ever hold us/ It's not a new wave/ It's just you and me.""</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney began work on <i>No Cities</i> in earnest around May 2012, they have said, but especially on the anthemic title track and ""Hey Darling""—the first two songs they wrote—you can hear echoes of that decade of pause, an airing out of just <i>why</i>. The titular phrase is abstract enough, but considering Brownstein's <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/arts/music/sleater-kinney-reunites.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vocal incompatibility</a> with the van-show-van-show tour-life void—and her lines, here, about ""a ritual of emptiness""—it plays like a direct take on the complicated reality of the rootless rock band and its scattered tribe. On ""Hey Darling"", one of Tucker's gummiest melodies becomes a letter to fans, reasoning her hiding: ""It seems to me the only thing/ That comes from fame is mediocrity,"" and then, ""Sometimes the shout of the room/ Makes me feel so alone."" The slow-burn of ""Fade"", the closer, also takes on Sleater-Kinney's hiatus. Tucker is like a Robert Plant putting her supernatural quasi-operatic range on display over epic, minor-key hard rock, switching from sly-voiced ballad to high-pitched inflection: ""If there's no tomorrow/ You better live,"" she sings of a dimming spotlight, her slipping self-perception. It's the closest <i>No Cities</i> gets to <i>The Woods' </i>feminist rewrite of '70s rock grandeur, and yet sounds like nothing on that record. Sleater-Kinney's discography is full of songs delivering meta-commentaries on what it means to be women playing rock; <i>No Cities </i>is more purely personal and explicitly political, evidence enough that in the context of family, middle-age, and multiple careers, it is possible to have everything.</p>
<p>For the first time in 21 years, Sleater-Kinney have written an album without a proper stomach-twisting tearjerker; no wistful confessions, breathless breakups, or dying lovers, no <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgr8e7da52o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Good Things""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VoWc3yypHs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""One More Hour""</a>, or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLFjkwUTeMQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Size of Our Love""</a>. But I predict Sleater-Kinney will be making more people cry this year than ever before—<a href=""https://twitter.com/lenadunham/status/556165335796441088"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">maybe Lena Dunham</a>, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jan/14/sleater-kinney-still-have-the-capacity-to-inspire-after-a-decade-away"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">maybe Perfect Pussy's Meredith Graves</a>, <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/carrie-brownsteins-life-after-punk-20140320"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">definitely Fred Armisen</a> (tears are highly subjective, and yet my claim is <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=sleater-kinney%20crying"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">substantiated</a>). ""We tell ourselves stories in order to live,"" Joan Didion famously wrote, and we align ourselves with the potent narratives of great bands for the same reason. Their songs guide us through the restless process of figuring out who we are. We search for meaning in rhythm and couplets and distortion, and if a band is grounded with as much purpose as Sleater-Kinney, they charge our consciousness, occupy space in our relationships, symbolize what we want to become. Sleater-Kinney's music still does this. It tells us—women or anyone who has ever felt small and othered—the truth, that even when the world seems to deny it, we are never powerless. Now the story goes on longer; it didn't have to end.</p></div>"|20148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20148-no-cities-to-love/|8.7|Jenn Pelly

The nine-song <i>Nights in the Dark</i> finds the Amherst, Mass., quartet dialing down the fuzz and traveling to the desert—at least psychically and spiritually—returning with moody instrumentals, darker pyrotechnics, even longer hair, a piano. They worked again with producer Justin Pizzoferrato, who handled the Dinosaur post-reunion albums <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17050-i-bet-on-sky/""><i>I Bet on Sky</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13109-farm/""><i>Farm</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10127-beyond/""><i>Beyond</i></a>, but otherwise, they've pulled themselves away from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">Mascis</a> and company and bring to mind the sort of lonesome rock oasis the <span class=""st""> Kirkwood</span> brothers were so good at locating.</p>
<p>The newfound variety has its appeal, and it illustrates admirable ambition, but the best material is still the stuff that blasts from the garage fast and furious. For instance, <i>Nights</i> opens powerfully with the title track—a pleasantly ambling, but urgent wash of '90s slacker rock that conjures that old Athens band <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eight_%28band%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Five Eight</a> and also brings to mind the more focused work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30054-milk-music/"">Milk Music</a> (""focused"" meaning only six minutes of tripped out riffing). It's followed by ""Red Planet"", a tighter shock of fist-pumping shout-along power punk. These two songs are more fully formed than the material on the debut, and on first listen, had me ready for a minor masterpiece.</p>
<p>But the momentum stalls with ""Ayla's Song"", a pretty and pretty unnecessary minute and a half of solo guitar tripping. It's fine and delicate and nice, but functions basically as a buzzkill. California X also add water to the fire with the mid-tempo ""Hadley, MA"", a turgid song that features great guitar playing from Lemmy Gurtowsky (per usual) and newer member Zack Brower, but otherwise grinds to a halt amid dopey lyrics and a sleepy chorus.</p>
<p>Much of the album's second half follows this path: the guitar playing and other instrumentation is excellent, but the songwriting feels like an afterthought. There are a couple of two-part songs here, and both could be halved. ""Blackrazor (pt. 1)"" creates a sighing psych atmosphere that might be the work any group of stoners with a wall of amplifiers, a sunset, and a heart. The revved-up ""Blackrazor (pt. 2)"", on the other hand, is muddier, more anthemic, and showcases the group doing what they do well, unleashing an autumnal SST-era rock haze.</p>
<p>Despite the stumbles, <i>Nights</i> includes some of California X's best work, and these moments are so strong, it's impossible to write the band off. This is clearly a transitional collection that sees the group trying new things, and you get the sense that they'll continue growing into a more mature sound. Especially because they do just that on closer ""Summer Wall (pt. 2)"", a gorgeous rocker that opens with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxLpEX2bt8w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Freak Scene""</a> strumming and hiss then fuses technical prowess and immediate, emotional hooks into a smeary, rollicking anthem. It's a reminder that sometimes you don't need to escape your early influences, you just need to approach them from a different direction.</p></div>"|20100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20100-nights-in-the-dark/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

In hindsight, the Chicago-bred/Milwaukee-based songwriter’s disjointed two-decade trajectory—under his nom de pop <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3342-plush/"" target=""_blank"">Plush</a> and, now, his birth name—was pretty much spelled out in the title of his early signature ""Soaring and Boring"": high expectations followed by agonizingly long periods of inactivity. On the surface, Hayes’ backstory boasts all the hallmarks of a contrarian eccentric genius, whether he was answering the orch-pop promise of Plush’s splendorous 1994 debut single ""Three-Quarters Blind Eyes""/""Found a Little Baby"" with 1998’s starkly somber solo-piano effort <i>More You Becomes You</i>; tinkering with the symphono-soul follow-up <i>Fed</i> so much he had to release it in <span>two</span> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6358-underfed/""><span>different</span></a> versions; or issuing certain albums in Japan only. But the uncommon lags between albums have mostly been a factor of Hayes losing his money rather than his mind, and trying to find sympathetic label backers to support a vision of tastefully constructed, soft-focus pop music that’s always been out of step with both mainstream and underground orthodoxies.  </p>
<p>Of course, the best way for a musician to kill their mythos is to simply release more music, which Hayes is now doing at unprecedented rate. <i>Slurrup</i> is actually the third album he’s put out this decade so far, following last year’s Japanese issue <i>Korp Sole Roller</i> and a soundtrack for Roman Coppola’s (widely panned) Jason Schwartzman vehicle <i>A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III</i> that also doubled as a career overview. But this is the first to receive a proper Stateside release since 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13497-bright-penny/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bright Penny</i></a>, whose ""Liam Hayes &amp; Plush"" branding offered the first hint that Hayes was eager to step out from the long shadow cast by his enigmatic alias. <i>Slurrup</i> presents more conclusive proof—coming on like the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apW-fj11T_k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span><i>Nazz</i></span></a> to <i>Korp Sole Roller</i>’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something/Anything%3F"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span><i>Something/Anything?</i></span></a>, its scrappy power-pop vigor and oddball found-sound interludes basically amount to Hayes tearing up his horn charts and saying, ""fuck it.""</p>
<p>From its opening snippets of studio chatter to its closing minute of, yes, actual slurping sounds, <i>Slurrup</i> frames itself as Hayes’ most irreverent, off-the-cuff album yet, complete with sloppy warm-up jams (the title track), GBV-scaled micro-anthems (""Fokus""), and creepy, carnivalesque audio collages (""Channel 44""). With the album clocking in at just over a half hour, there’s an impatient, impulsive energy at play here that’s never surfaced on any of Hayes’ previous work, as if the weight of his recalcitrant reputation was driving him to crank out the album as quickly as possible, imperfections and all. But the stripped-down setting ultimately provides a better showcase of Hayes’ songwriting smarts than his more immaculately orchestrated efforts, putting the focus squarely on his swoon-worthy melodicism and underrated sense of humor. </p>
<p>Though beholden to the big-B holy trinity of power pop (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24134-badfinger/"">Badfinger</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>), <i>Slurrup</i> is the unmistakable product of Hayes’ peculiar personality, infusing songs that feel like lost '70s classics with dispiriting images of stardom unattained, from the ""broken green Mercedes"" of ""Keys to Heaven"" to the delirious ""Outhouse"", the perfect complement to the next existential crisis you suffer while trapped in a music-festival porta-potty. Even the album’s more gracefully subdued moments simmer with discomfort: On the gorgeous nocturnal ballad ""Greenfield"", Hayes manages to make the line ""I went to find a grocery store with imitation meat"" sound like the ultimate fool’s errand, while the luxuriant lost-love lament ""August Fourteen"" feels like a transmission from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28727-alex-chilton/"">Alex Chilton</a>’s darkest hour—and like <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>, when the violins do finally appear, the effect is more haunting than haughty.</p>
<p>But with the valiant, unicorn-riding closer ""Fight Magic With Magic"", Hayes embraces his role as a pop outsider with a renewed sense of gusto: ""I used to watch the hit parade/ Contaminated everything it played/ Then you came along and let me see/ How to pull the tricks they pulled on me."" The triumph of <i>Slurrup </i>is that, for the first time since his debut single, Hayes makes that trickery seem effortless. In short: talented songwriter releases quality album loaded with quality tunes. It may not make for the sexiest rock'n'roll myth, but it’s the simple narrative Hayes has been trying to assert since day one.</p></div>"|20119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20119-slurrup/|7.3|Stuart Berman

You hear a sigh, he hears a melody; you a grunt, he a bassline. You hear a joke and… well, McFerren probably hears a joke too. He likes jokes. You discover discrepancies like these while listening to McFerren's work as MCFERRDOG, a riot of samples held just in check by subby kick drums and stinging snares. Kin to techno pranksters like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"">DJ Koze</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2142-isolee/"">Isolée</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, McFerren specializes in all the funny noises a mouth can make—or the synths that can fake them—though he never lets his fascination impede him from making surprisingly slamming dance tunes. McFerren makes funhouse music, pun intended: an amalgam of dance styles set apart by its goof and whimsy.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Lawd Forgive Me</i> is McFerren's second MCFERRDOG album (he has a handful 12""s under his own name as well), and it arrives—like last year's excellent <i>Club Amniotics</i>—via prolific <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?2351"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">upstart</a> Vancouver label <a href=""http://1080pcollection.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1080p</a>. The label’s MO, a Gatling gun of weird, underground electronic music, and choice of format—the label releases only via cassette and digital—make it difficult for a young artist to stand out, and indeed McFerren seems to remain off the radar of DJs and trend watchers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Lawd Forgive Me</i> is something of an ode to classic rave, a sample-based music whose sense of humor offset its withering assaults. <i>Lawd</i> is similarly stuffed to the gills, reaching for any hook it can grasp and then deploying it in staccato bursts, recycling and appropriating as it sees fit. It mimics rave’s bolted-on mysticism, deploying preachers and movie dialogue. Standout ""Acid"" is particularly egregious, prominently utilizing samples from Black Box’s mega-hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lOb799cTxM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ride on Time""</a> over a tricky breakbeat, a distorted voice periodically chanting ""Aciiiiiiddddd."" As usual, there’s a yuks to be had: acid house’s familiar, squelching bassline is the only trope missing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Rave revivalism has been a trendy maneuver recently, and part of <i>Lawd Forgive Me</i>’s appeal is that is has no interest in imitating old sounds. Nor, crucially, does McFerren seem interested in rave's future, as artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a> have hinted at with their gleaming maximalism. <i>Lawd Forgive Me</i> jacks and pumps in a distinctly modern manner: its samples clear-eyed, their stitching hidden. Rave evolves the same way stage magic does: the conceit remains constant, the deception and lures improve.</p>
<p><i>Lawd Forgive Me</i>’s tracks make tight, expert turns. It can seem like McFerren’s veering wildly if you’re not used to a suspension tuned this tightly, when the opposite is actually true. ""Timeless"" (note another rave banality) takes its time setting up a bog-standard, rising bridge—windswept chords, fiery gospel exultations—only to suck the air out of the room with a minimal, whistling synth. It’s the techno equivalent of pulling the trigger and firing a little ""Bang!"" flag.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">McFerren’s vision isn’t quite so refined, even if his craft is: the back half of <i>Lawd Forgive Me</i> packs fewer surprises, though the seasick sway of ""Make Our Own Prisons"" indicates McFerren’s been taking cues from UK upstarts like Elgato. But at its best <i>Lawd Forgive Me</i> howls with laughter and creativity, entertaining enough for your desk but surprisingly burly and rugged.

Kami de Chukwu and Joey Purp—usually third and fourth-billed on the SaveMoney roster—charted a more wayward course, one which has gone largely unnoticed outside of Chicago, even as Chance and Mensa’s stars have risen. Dead-set against self-seriousness, Kami and Joey’s collaborative project, Leather Corduroys, is something of an unholy inversion of Chance’s recent experiments in genre-warping: Drawing on everything from <i>outré</i> indie pop to regional street rap idioms to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1505-funkadelic/"">Funkadelic</a>, the duo’s often experimental music is fragmented and arch in attitude, instead of ultra-populist and grandiose.</p>
<p>On their debut full-length <i>Season</i>, Kami and Joey show little regard for honoring anyone's definition of a hot rap record, or indeed for making hip-hop at all. When ""verses"" crop up, they are spare and gutted, like traditional sixteens that have been submitted to random subtractive processes (""Breadwinner, breadwinners, breadwinner/ Money sandwiches/ Cheese, bread and lettuce/ Let us all get it, we got it/ You better catch up with us""). The leftover bullet points—more based on matching attractive word sounds than logical syntax—are adorned with playful references (see the bromide of exaggerated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> flows on ""In Da Club"" and ""Remember Me""). The approach is a far cry from the comparative pyrotechnics of their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNLtGZzmDbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>SaveMoney posse cuts</span></a>, <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Kami-de-Chukwu-LIGHT-mixtape.389265.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>solo mixtapes</span></a>, and formative <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7unOQ7BNslY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Meth and Red-style collabs</span></a>, but often engaging.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On Twitter, Joey used the metaphor of blurring <a href=""https://twitter.com/JoeyPurps/status/552549623240605696"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>imaginary lines</span></a> to articulate a partial mission statement for the group. The image seems applicable not only to Leather Corduroys' propensity for juggling and reimagining styles, but to a blurring of the divide between irony and sincerity that's inherent to their music. From the detuned <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> capering of ""My Good Girl"" to the overdriven rap-rock of ""Developers"" (structured around the screamed refrain ""N*ggas dying like it's Baghdad in this bitch""), <i>Season</i> is a tough album with which to find a conceptual entry point. The first inevitable question—""What are they going for here?""—will loom large enough to alienate some listeners entirely.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite how risky the undertaking seems on paper, the album proves to be much more than a collection of half-jokes with short shelf-lives. With Serious Rap <a href=""https://twitter.com/kamidechukwu/status/552605125517537280"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>off the table</span></a> as a posture, the raw, whip-smart musicianship of Kami, Joey, and their varied cast of producers (including SaveMoney insiders Peter Cottontale and Thelonious Martin, Odd Future traditionalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29960-the-internet/"">the Internet</a>, and underrated French electro-cum-trapsmith Ikaz) is left at loose ends, resulting in music which innovates, imitates, confounds, and deliberately rankles. ""Badmon"", the album’s highlight, begins with a clattering drum tattoo straight off a late-'90s New Orleans rap record, twinkling vocoder pulses (courtesy of frequent collaborator and asset Knox Fortune) and Kami calling the court to order in patois, before cutting to a bit of muscular <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"">N.E.R.D.</a>-y funk complete with falsetto war cries. The more challenging ""RMS/Launch"", another diptych, pairs an awkward rock shuffle and inscrutable nursery rhyming with what sounds like MC Ride shouting down a vaporwave-y Casio preset. But perhaps more surprising than these <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4742-frank-zappa/"">Zappa</a>-esque moments is ""Adios"", a rote tribute to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a> which uses ""humina humina"" as a placeholder for the polarizing Atlanta star’s usual un-Genius-able asides. The song is not a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27233-the-lonely-island/"">Lonely Island</a> skit in the making, however—it’s earnest and successful pop. As with all of the best songs on the album, the key to its success is small, insistent melodic and lyrical ideas, repeated into significance.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-1520f2b6-fec2-c8c5-6993-e8a038a20f4e"">Less than half way through the album, the hardly-there <a href=""http://www.stonesthrow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stones Throw</a> neo-soul of ""Marijuana Smoker"" is interrupted as unceremoniously as a Flying Circus skit: a door opens, and a smooth-talking entrepreneur (a kind of Italian-American answer to <a href=""https://screen.yahoo.com/bill-swerskis-super-fans-da-000000191.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Bill Swerski’s Superfans</span></a>) explains how to make leather corduroy pants out of dessicated banana peels, polyurethane, and mesh—in other words, without either leather or corduroy. Like this shaggy-dog monologue and the impossible process it falls short of describing, the Leather Corduroys project is an equation that doesn’t add up—a paradox apropos of nothing. The key to appreciating the music on <i>Season</i> is accepting that the questions it seems to raise don’t have answers, or aren’t worth asking. Moving past them allows one to appreciate the slight album’s full-bodied aesthetic, built from scrap parts and energized by Kami and Joey’s devotion to the old adage: First thought, best thought.</span></p></div>"|20150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20150-season/|6.8|Winston Cook-Wilson

Instead of feeling good in a Decemberists song, there was ""a rush of ripe élan,"" and it wasn’t just seeing some girls over there, it was ""15 lithesome maidens lay along in their bower."" The vellum-bound folios of Colin Meloy’s songs are full of heightened verse that make them fun in the same way that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW3gKKiTvjs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kate Bush singing about Heathcliff and Cathy</a>, or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bETFh4eRdM8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Gabriel’s cape from ""Watcher of the Skies""</a>, or swirling wine around in a glass is fun. There’s so much joy, however affected, in Meloy’s language: It’s camp for fans of Hawthorne.</p>
<p>The Decemberists also have a habit of over-correcting. The tripartite song suite on 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9472-the-crane-wife/""><i>The Crane Wife</i></a> was blown out of proportion into an exhausting prog opus on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12842-the-hazards-of-love/""><i>The Hazards of Love</i></a> in 2009. Then they bounced back in an exercise in restraint with their previous album, the ambling and dusty <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15000-the-king-is-dead/"">The King Is Dead</a>.</i> It was a necessary addition to the band’s canon, and a concept album in so far as it was proof that they could just write a few songs without culling themes from Elizabethan texts or Japanese folk tales. On their seventh LP, <i>What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World, </i>they balance out and cruise down the middle of the road, sounding more like a polite, modern folk rock band with only a touch of antiquity here and there. It’s a charming but predictable album aimed at the faithful, but provides few if any new tracks that measure up to those in their back catalog.</p>
<p>Part of what made their first several albums so entertaining was both that unique counterpoint and, well, they were kinda fun. There was a <i>joie de vivre</i> in the way Meloy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgtIuZRj_fo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sang ""joie de vivre""</a> on his first album in his signature voice that turned every simple vowel into a triphthong. Lovesick soldiers, chimbly sweeps, lovers’ suicide, a mom whoring herself out for money to a ship of sailors: It was nothing if not entertaining.</p>
<p>Now the Decemberists seem wrapped up in themselves, wistful and mature, careful not to become caricatures while also trying to push their sound forward. The one new impulse they find here is meta songwriting. In some world it might be fun to hear a band sing about how they ""had to change some"" to keep those bookish fans and put in a cute line about selling out for Axe shampoo, but turns out it’s quite a bit more grating than the errant Victorian quirk. That’s how the album opens, ""The Singer Addresses His Audience"", with another <i>kind</i> of cuteness and it’s hardly any fun at all.</p>
<p>The self-reflexive angle comes up again on ""Anti-Summersong"", a reference to their ""Summersong"" from <i>The Crane Wife.</i> ""I’m not going on just to sing another sing-a-long, suicide song,"" Meloy sings, a flippant but not entirely serious jibe at his past. The tune is orchestrated like a traditional Stephen Foster folk tune, with square fiddle lines, a little banjo, a plucked acoustic guitar, and a true Americana harmonica solo. It’s more of the same roots feel they put to work on <i>The King Is Dead</i>, but everything feels a little paler and undercooked. The band’s live-tracking and Meloy’s plea to just move on from his past attempt to break new ground, but outside of a few lite rafter shakers, so much of what may pass for tuneful songwriting here is mostly just pleasant and formless outlines of songs.</p>
<p>But they had to change, and Meloy doesn’t want to sing about lovers' suicide pacts anymore, so we get Meloy the dreamer, Meloy the ponderous, Meloy the contemplative. Some tracks are more autobiographical, like the literally effortless ""Lake Song"", recalling a snapshot of lakeside love when Meloy was 17 and ""terminally fey."" The only anchor to its saccharine lines (""You were full and sweet as honeydew"") is an acoustic guitar strumming in a rhythm that was perfected by kids in college dorm rooms years ago. It’s followed immediately by ""Till the Water's All Long Gone"", a narrative-based tune that wanders around in 6/8 and is quite possibly about protecting the fountain of youth from a tribe of hill folk.</p>
<p>Those big sing-a-longs of the past now scan more power pop and less sea shanty. ""Make You Better"" might as well be the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26449-the-new-pornographers/"">New Pornographers</a>, especially with the use of Kelly Hogan and Rachel Flotard as back-up vocalists, who add beautiful harmonies at the climax. The band has never lacked the musical bona fides to write a great anthem. And here it’s not a macabre, smirking tale about military wives or some Spanish monarch, but a song about how prescribing love is by no means a way to fix our own problems. You start to see Meloy himself more than ever, and it’s at once refreshing and a little unsettling how much he still hides behind poeticism.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But the failure of this album, in addition to being overlong and under-ambitious, is the idea that maturity should beget lazy, hammock songs. Some songs were written as long as four years ago, just after <i>The King Is Dead. </i>There's pleasure in feeling time pass on the album, but it passes so slowly, and at some points, interminably. The pro forma folk-rock of the entire thing is a slog. Of course the marks of the Decemberists are still there: A nod to Tennyson (""Cavalry Captain""), a lazy obsession with style (for things are both ill- <i>and</i> misbegotten), a healthy vocabulary (<i>prevaricate, sibylline, eidolon</i>), and the cheeky and bawdy song about oral sex (""Philomena""). But gone is the wild-eyed, fearless, nerdy-ass band who once said ""fuck it we’re gonna do a 10-minute song about a revenge-murder inside whale."" To borrow a theme from the album, this is the part of the the Decemberists’ story where you skim to the next chapter.</span></p></div>"|20083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20083-what-a-terrible-world-what-a-beautiful-world/|5.6|Jeremy D.

For bands, it’s often either measured by record sales, critical acclaim, or—as is the case with San Francisco band the Dodos—simple endurance. The twosome of Meric Long and Logan Kroeber have been making music together for the better part of a decade and by now they have honed their own distinct language. The records they make together as the Dodos are generally characterized by a kind of symbiotic back and forth—a balance composed of virtuoso playing, alternately-tuned guitar sounds, and insanely intricate drum patterns. That they have managed to create a sound that is instantly and distinctly recognizable as their own (and amass a devoted following) is no small feat, but figuring out how to push their sound forward without repeating themselves or abandoning their aesthetic has proven to be much trickier business.</span></p>
<p><span>After tinkering with their sound in a variety of ways over the past few years—employing additional musicians, sprinkling on layers of electric vibraphone, eschewing acoustic guitars for electric ones, sanding off the rough edges by hiring Phil Ek as a producer—the band seems to have come full-circle on </span><i>Individ</i><span>, their sixth album. Rather than look outside themselves, the duo rely instead on what has always been their greatest weapon—the sheer physicality of their playing.</span><span> </span></p>
<p>Recorded hot on the heels of the sessions for 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18384-the-dodos-carrier/"" target=""_blank""><i>Carrier</i></a>—an album seemingly haunted by the death of occasional contributing guitarist Christopher Reimer—<i>Individ</i> plays like a companion piece to the band's breakthrough <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18384-the-dodos-carrier/"" target=""_blank"">Visiter</a></i>. ""Until now there was a reason/ Let go of it,"" Long sings on album opener ""Precipitation"". The song—a shape-shifting acoustic-and-drums affair—serves as a kind of primer for the rest of the album. What seems like a simple bit of repetition and melody grows increasingly more forceful before exploding into a stadium-size loop of riffs and pounding drums. ""Let go of it/ And get out of here/ Let’s get out of here/ For good"" sings Long in what seems less like a concession of defeat and more a statement of liberation. As album openers go, it’s a doozy—six minutes of triumphantly shaking off a lot of old baggage. ""We’ll keep playing/ Till there is nothing,"" he promises elsewhere on ""The Tide"", further establishing what could be <i>Individ</i>’s most prevalent and endearing theme—a sense of acceptance paired with dogged resilience.</p>
<p class=""normal"">The Dodos began their career as avowed primitivists before eventually experimenting with ways to broaden their sound. Longtime fans of the band will appreciate <i>Individ</i>’s back-to-basics quality, which generally forgoes electric guitars in favor of Long’s maniacal strumming and dexterous, breakneck time changes. ""Competition"", the record’s first single, showcases the band at their most deceptively simple: dueling guitar lines playing against a staccato rhythm, all being tugged along by Long’s effortless vocal. In this case, the band’s reaction <i>against </i>perfection is what makes most of <i>Individ </i>so sublime. Both Long and Kroeber are virtuoso musicians, and while Long’s vocals rarely ever strain to be anything more than pleasantly plaintive, hearing he and Kroeber push themselves to the point of raggedness as musicians is what continues to make the Dodos’ music such a surprising and singular listen.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Clocking in at almost 40 minutes, the nine tracks on <i>Individ </i>make for an exhilarating, albeit fairly melancholy, listening experience. While the duo has not lost their youthful exuberance as players (listening to Long and Kroeber rip through ""Retriever"" is a potent reminder of what a thrillingly visceral band the Dodos actually are), <i>Individ</i> seems mostly wrapped up with very adult concerns. And while the band might never better the pop jubilance of <i>Visiter</i>’s ""Fools"", tracks like ""The Tide"" and the perfectly wistful ""Bubble"" come mighty close. On <i>Individ</i>’s closing track, the sprawling, seven-minute ""Pattern Shadow"", Long intones that ""I cannot predict/ All your patterns/ You blew us away/ And I could not escape."" It's unclear exactly to whom he is singing, but the shadow at the core of the song—mysterious, ever-present, ocean-sized—could be a fitting stand in for the band itself and the epic, mercurial nature of their songs. In the record’s press materials, Long explains, ""This record is about accepting what is natural for you or even a part of you."" Ten years deep into their career, the Dodos have never actually steered too far from their roots, but the loose, unselfconscious feel of <i>Individ </i>proves that there is something to be said for recognizing and playing to your strengths, trusting your chops, and simply feeling things as intensely as you possibly can.</p></div>"|20060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20060-individ/|7.2|T.

Born in Philly, but raised in the sticks of Connecticut, he would settle in New York in the early 2000s just in time for his former band, Inouk, to enjoy its 15 pixels of fame during the post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/953-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/"">Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</a> blog rush. A subsequent failed attempt to establish himself as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9580-mansions/"">an Astralwerks-backed singer-songwriter</a> would prompt McMahon to hole himself up in a Catskills cabin to record his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13476-dia/"">wilfully primitive debut as Amen Dunes</a>, before embarking upon an extended self-exile to China. But since returning stateside around the start of this decade, McMahon has increasingly channeled his sense of wanderlust into his music, breaking down his traditional folk-rock roots to open up more celestial spaces, and amassing an ever-expanding circle of collaborators like a backpacker making new friends at a hostel lounge.</p>
<p>For his 2014 triumph, <i>Love</i>, he decamped to Montreal and ensconced himself in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> inner circle to produce his most fully realized, emotionally resonant work to date. In interviews, McMahon often cited <i>Astral Weeks</i> and Pharoah Sanders’ turn-of-the-'70s odysseys as inspirations for the album’s spiritually infused sprawl, but <i>Love</i>’s seemingly loose aesthetic did not come without much tinkering and second-guessing. (The album reportedly took five studios and over a year to complete.) The new <i>Cowboy Worship</i> EP sheds light on McMahon’s meticulous methodology: Four of its six tracks are reprises of <i>Love</i> songs, and though the differences between these versions and the official ones are sometimes barely perceptible, they serve as testaments to McMahon’s determination to get the vibe just right.</p>
<p>In fact, the rendition of ""I Know Myself"" that opens the EP is identical to the one that appears on <i>Love</i>, its gradual transformation from solitary strummer to communal hymn serving as a microcosm of Amen Dunes’ own creative evolution. However, this time McMahon lets the tape roll past the final chord, and after he confidently declares ""that’s the one, I think,"" we hear a chintzy electronic-doorbell chime, the sort of modern dollar-store distraction that Amen Dunes’ music seems designed to transport us away from. ""Woah, perfect timing,"" McMahon chuckles as drummer Parker Kindred enters the studio, but in that seemingly frivolous exchange, a certain maxim of recording is reinforced. A perfect take ultimately requires the serendipitous absence of external distractions beyond one’s control; the artist’s actual performance is just one of many stars that have to align.</p>
<p>That said, the first drafts McMahon scrapped along the way to <i>Love</i>’s completion could’ve easily held their own amid the album proper; in lieu of any major structural variations, the early versions heard on <i>Cowboy Worship</i> are more like alternate mixes that accentuate or deemphasize McMahon’s measured use of noise. <i>Love</i>’s raucous, in-the-red climax ""I Can’t Dig It"" is presented in a more controlled, piano-rolled take (recorded as he first wrote it in China), but the quieter performance ultimately serves to amplify the textural strangeness wafting behind McMahon’s anthemic exclamations. And while a primordial ""Green Eyes"" lacks the haunting Elias Rønnenfelt guest vocal that imbues the <i>Love</i> version, it’s given a thick coating of molten psychedelic ooze courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6493-harvey-milk/"">Harvey Milk</a>’s Stephen Tanner. (The EP also features a revision of ""Lezzy Head"" from 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15760-through-donkey-jaw/""><i>Through Donkey Jaw</i></a> that dials down the original’s oddball wobble for a more patient, meditative treatment closer in spirit to <i>Love</i>.) </p>
<p>Given the similarities to its source material, <i>Cowboy Worship</i> probably would’ve made more sense as a bonus-disc appendage to <i>Love</i> than a stand-alone release. <span>The EP even closes just as </span><i>Love</i><span><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;""><span> does, with the latter’s eight-minute title track (the apotheosis of McMahon’s effort to unite singer-songwriter tradition with avant-jazz exploration), and while the </span></span></span><i>Cowboy Worship</i><span><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, serif;""> mix gradually brings <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"">Colin Stetson</a> and Jen Reimer’s subliminal horn hum to the fore, such subtleties simply reinforce the original’s transportive, out-of-body effect</span></span>. As such, <i>Cowboy Worship</i>’s most notable feature is also its outlier: a Ben Greenberg-assisted, dueling-acoustic rip through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4958-tim-buckley/"">Tim Buckley</a>’s ""Song to the Siren"". It’s a tune that’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88wL8oRf45U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hardly</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw9ANFOuMBU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lacking</a> for covers, of course, and McMahon acknowledges this history by imagining Buckley covering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1LeXdP9lcM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Mortal Coil’s immortal version</a> of his own song. But Buckley’s conflation of human and earthly nature fits right into <i>Love</i>’s thematic wheelhouse—and, by striking the same balance of ethereal and elemental that defines the music of Amen Dunes, McMahon makes ""Siren"" his own.</p></div>"|20085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20085-cowboy-worship-ep/|6.9|Stuart Berman

That album's title track even gripped something like a hook: ""Is rapture your only fear/ Or do you think about it at all?"" asks singer Brian Case at the chorus. Sure, he's musing on the end of days, but at least he's singing right to us. No such luck with the Chicago band's fifth album, <i>Irreal</i>. Disappears have traded in their last pop streak for a world of stark and brutal rhythm.</p>
<p>Instead of questions, answers, and hypotheses, the lyrics on <i>Irreal</i> assume the shape of isolated fragments. Instead of melodies, the instruments trace shrapnel in the wind. ""I want to remember/ Make me,"" Case demands on ""Interpretation"" as a roiling drum pattern whips past him. He repeats the words in a steely monotone, only breaking his flat timbre when he throws the occasional ""oi!"" away from the mike. Somewhere behind him, guitars that don't sound like guitars play chords that don't sound like chords. ""Anything could happen,"" he smirks, and it's more of a threat than a promise.</p>
<p><i>Irreal</i> is a deliberately exhausting listen. The band dares you to see how far you can stomp behind them without a melodic phrase or a lyrical narrative to grab hold of. But unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>, who paved much of this terrain, Disappears sound more resigned than spiteful. They're eager to pummel themselves, but not because it offers any catharsis.</p>
<p><span>""Another thought/ Another memory,"" Case drones later in the record. ""Living in a loop of different lives."" His accompaniment is pitchy, nervous, and streaked with noise. The drums racket from the right channel to the left. This is cabin fever at its most intricate, a cage of beautiful repeating patterns that holds no chance of escape.</span></p>
<p>On the album's title track, the guitars seem to bicker with each other, cutting squalls of feedback with sharp, demented arpeggios. Even the name sounds like a trap, a portmanteau of ""unreal"" and ""irregular,"" maybe, a word that's just familiar enough to hint at meaning while still coming up void. When Case pronounces it, it sounds like ""I will."" I wonder if there's supposed to be a pun on ""IRL"", too.</p>
<p><span>The song ""Halcyon Days"" probably hides a joke about aging behind its title. It's certainly no calm before the storm. That may be <i>Irreal</i>'s whole punchline: You count your years in suffocating routines and repeated patterns. You build memories somewhere between the filler. What do you get from it, except a library of respites to look back on in the tedium? What good are the best days of your life if you can only access them in retrospect?</span></p>
<p><span>The album's last song coughs up the first melodic bass line in the whole piece, a mournful, descending figure. ""Am I alone now?"" Case wonders as the record spirals to a close. The band named that song ""Navigating the Void"". If <i>Irreal</i> is a map, don't expect to stop walking in tight, lonely circles.</span></p></div>"|20065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20065-irreal/|7.0|Sasha Geffen

Bay Area composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32669-kaitlyn-aurelia-smith/"">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith</a> has produced works before, ranging from the glacial wistfulness of <a href=""http://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/useful-trees"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Useful Trees</i></a> to electronic compositions with a distinctly agrarian hue (<a href=""http://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/cows-will-eat-the-weeds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cows will eat the weeds</i></a>). This album, her first for <a href=""http://westernvinyl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Western Vinyl</a>, is Smith’s most complete album yet, with a range that encompasses something approaching song structure and a form of ambient drift that nimbly floats up into the stratosphere. The overall feeling of enchantment is only heightened by learning that <i>Euclid</i> was recorded primarily on a <a href=""http://www.noisebug.net/site/effects/index.cfm?ID=524"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buchla Music Easel</a>, a synth as colorful as the sounds it creates, and vocal passages that only occasionally resemble words. She puts some separation between its two sides, flooding <i>Euclid</i>’s first half with song-y material then plunging into a reflective pool in its backend, making it feel like Smith took out a pair of scissors and carefully cut the record in two.</p>
<p>The most noticeable trait of <i>Euclid</i> is how light it feels—there’s very little bass, nothing much to hold it down. It appears to just float there in front of you, opening up its kaleidoscopic layers. Smith grew up in isolation, on an island in Washington state, and there’s a certain singularity to her work that surely grew out of those roots. She often appears adrift in her music, endlessly laying strips of sound over one another until everything’s just right. For ""Careen"", Smith works in a space similar to the one inhabited by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5373-high-places/"">High Places</a> in the latter part of the last decade, where hippy idylls, rustic charm, and gusty pop combine as one. If there is a darker component to her work it’s in the processed vocals, which resemble the type of squelchy effects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9507-karin-dreijer-andersson/"" target=""_blank"">Karin Dreijer Andersson</a> tried on for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/""><i>Silent Shout</i></a> on ""Wide Awake"". Still, those are only loose comparisons—a big part of the charm of <i>Euclid</i> is in hearing someone mapping out their own space and time, figuring out their own destination to land in.</p>
<p>Of the first half-dozen songs here it’s in ""Sundry"" that everything coalesces, with Smith drawing on a tone that’s just the right side of whimsical. It’s here that her instrumental passages squeak and cry, feeling like she’s conducting a dialogue with them through the wordless vocal inflections skirting across the top. There’s joy, although not the kind that gives over to abandon—her music is slightly too studied for that. Smith indulges the considered side of her personality further on the set of ""Labyrinth""-themed tracks that make up the second half of <i>Euclid</i>, where rain-like trickles of synth vie with cloudier electronics and deep pulses purposefully obscured in the mix. It’s in a similar sphere to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30634-laurie-spiegel/"">Laurie Spiegel</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17067-the-expanding-universe/""><i>The Expanding Universe</i></a>, where rhythms come together then break apart, where a single one- or two-note riff becomes a macrocosm unto itself. Sometimes it’s a little too blurry, but it’s superseded by the way Smith works her way around sounds to open up new dimensions in them.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhtar8FlgzU#t=123"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video clip</a> of Smith playing her Music Easel, which enforces this album’s air of beauty mixed in with color and conjury. Smith plugs brightly colored cables into its modular interface and her hands drift over its silvery keys, creating an expanse of sound that’s more elastic than you might expect from just a few operations. There’s an element of gear fetishization to it for sure, but also a healthy dose of wonder, causing it to feel like you’re watching someone just as enamored of the process of discovery as they are with delivering a final product. That’s a useful way to describe <i>Euclid</i>, with Smith figuring out a place to operate in somewhere between structure and freedom, often indulging one and not the other. This feels like a beginning rather than a natural way forward, but it’s driven by an important idea—where the process of separation can be a more powerful and intuitive way of working than forcing harmony upon contrasting ideas.</p></div>"|20084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20084-euclid/|7.3|Nick Neyland

<p>While trying to build an album of stuff that’s approximately as good as ""No Flex Zone"" or ""No Type"" is a tall task, <i>SremmLife</i> hurdles the hype machine with infectious rap music. It never sags, packing hooks into every pocket and half-beat. Swae Lee giddily slides over syllables (""trill-ass ind-div-vid-du-al"" on ""No Flex Zone"") while Slim Jimmy’s gruffer delivery sets up an interesting vocal dynamic where sometimes it’s difficult to discern who’s rapping, but at other times it’s clear as day. A six-second snippet of each song would be enough for its own free-standing Vine, but often the full product—energetic pounds like ""Up Like Trump"" and ""YNO""—earns its longer form.</p>
<p>Though a few songs stretch out an interesting idea too far—for instance, the post-Nae-Nae scrum ""My X""—<i>SremmLife</i> is a showcase of an electric new talent paired with all the trappings of a bigtime major label debut. Guests like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"" target=""_blank"">Big Sean</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"" target=""_blank"">Young Thug</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a> (who sings the earworm hook on strip-club anthem ""Throw Sum Mo"") meet the energy of the Brown brothers, who are paired with exceptional production from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"" target=""_blank"">Mike WiLL</a>, Sonny Digital, and others. The music here is at once huge but also inward looking—burly soundscapes like ""No Type"" and the closer ""Safe Sex Pay Checks"" create an atmosphere that suggest something shadowy lurking outside the frame. Given that<i> SremmLife</i> is a flagship of Mike WiLL’s new Ear Drummer  imprint, it may not be surprising that <i>SremmLife</i> is a logical companion to his other recent pop-minded success—Miley Cyrus’ <i>Bangerz</i>, the album equivalent of being caught up in the thrill of an epic party but knowing that it’ll soon come crashing down. It’s life-affirming music in ways that make you feel both better <i>and </i>worse.</p>
<p><i>SremmLife</i> fulfills the promise of ""No Flex Zone"" and ""No Type"", though a prominent piece of the record hints at something more. ""This Could Be Us"", <i>SremmLife</i>’s fifth song, stands apart from the whole. A lovely track about a failed relationship, the brothers Brown—Jimmy rapping, Swae singing—deliver a promise that’s easy to project a successful career upon. Above all else Rae Sremmurd pull you in with their synergy and symmetry: <i>SremmLife</i> is a less of an album and more of a way of life.</p></div>"|20113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20113-sremmlife/|7.8|Corban Goble

Her last solo album, 2013's self-released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17619-goldenheart/"" target=""_blank""><i>Goldenheart</i></a>, portrayed a love affair in the language of battle and war, while 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16486-armor-on-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Armor On</i></a> channeled it through religious devotion. It's potentially hammy territory, but it works because Richard sells it so well—she's a tremendously evocative singer who can turn a song as fluffy as Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" into something truly exotic and alluring. And with help from her close partner Druski, she dressed it all up in sleek, futuristic production. All of that made last year's reunion of Danity Kane, the ""Making the Band"" group with which she got her start, almost shocking, at least on Richard's part. Jettisoning her independent freedom in favor of cookie-cutter girl-group pop she already managed to escape once, it turned out the group couldn't contain her anyway. The reunion only lasted a few months, resulting in a nearly-unlistenable album and an alleged physical altercation involving Richard. Now, just a few months after <i>DK3</i> landed with a flop, we get <i>Blackheart</i>, a fierce and sometimes harrowing album that feels all the more potent given the shaky year that preceded it.</p>
<p><i>Blackheart</i> is the second installment in Richard's planned <i>Heart</i> trilogy, and it also launches a new phase in her career which she calls ""The Black Era."" Appropriately, the music is darker, more paranoid, and more personal. Where <i>Goldenheart</i>'s themes of romance were intentionally universal, <i>Blackheart</i> deals with Richard's own experiences in the music industry, her frustrations and her frayed nerves. She also plays a much larger role in the production, co-producing most of the tracks herself with Noisecastle III. Don't be fooled by the bump and grind R&amp;B of first single ""Blow""; <i>Blackheart</i> offers a sprawling and sometimes knotty take on songwriting, sometimes doing away with verse and chorus structure altogether and settling on a stream-of-consciousness barrage instead.</p>
<p>The album's opening run seems purposefully designed to scare away less adventurous listeners with rushing synth runs, jungle breaks, and sharply-cut vocal samples. Dawn doesn't even come in for three minutes on ""Calypso"", and once she does, she's nearly taken in by the tide anyways. The idea might be a cliché at this point, but on <i>Blackheart</i> Richard truly uses the studio as an instrument. Organic sounds are few and far between, and just when you think you've got a hold on a song, it could all melt away and morph into something else entirely. ""Billie Jean"" turns from side-eye rant into an orchestral ballad, and the cautionary tale ""Adderall/Sold"" swells into a passionate vocoder hymnal where Richard bellows ""She was living/ Like she's dying soon"" with such conviction that it's hard to believe she's not talking about herself. The vocoder aappears over and over on <i>Blackhear</i>t, embellishing her cries with a gravity that meshes with the already otherworldly texture of her natural voice.</p>
<p>There are a few more traditional moments on <i>Blackhear</i><i>t</i>, beginning with the power ballad ""Warriors"", which sounds like a holdover from <i>Goldenhear</i><i>t</i>. ""Projection"" is a stunning rumination on memory that sounds illusory, transient, and in danger of simply flickering out at any moment, while ""Castles"" focuses on themes of fragility and solidarity amidst a torrent of vocal ad-libs both sampled and Richard's own. This section of the album forms a redemptive arc that peaks with ""Phoenix"", a feel-good duet with ex-Danity Kane partner Aundrea Fimbres that would be overbearing if it didn't feel so triumphant. Look at it one way and it's a typical radio song about coming back from heartbreak, but put it in the context of Richard's career outside her solo work—a series of false starts unbefitting of such a uniquely talented artist—and it feels transcendent. Even its relatively simple structure and Top 40 sonics register as a renewed sense of clarity rather than a compromise.</p>
<p>The excess of ""Phoenix"" is tempered by ""Choices"", a short interlude where Richard croons ""I love you/ But I love me more"" over gilded threads of synthesizer. It's one of the many little moments on <i>Blackheart</i> that feels like an emotional punch in the stomach, especially once she starts cooing ""I choose me"" in gorgeous falsetto melisma that sounds as effortless as her talk-singing on ""Billie Jean"". ""Choices"" and penultimate track ""Deep""—a bare, conciliatory climax—are a reminder that beneath all the production flourishes and high-art concepts, Richard is also a deft and powerful vocalist.</p>
<p>""Deep"" is a heartbreaking conclusion where Richard acknowledges her mistakes. ""Trying to save the little soul I have left/ I lost it in a poker game to the highest bet/ And if you ask me I'm not the kind to play and quit/ And even though I lost the best of me/ It was worth it,"" goes the opening verse, a confession from someone who was, at one point in her career, part of a major pop group. As she stands now, Richard is a lone wolf, and <i>Blackheart</i> reaffirms it. The album pulls her back onto the path she she started with <i>Armor On</i> and into unknown territory.</p>
<p>""I took it to the deep,"" she sings on the song's chorus, ""because my heart doesn't swim in shallow creeks."" She's not exaggerating: if there's anything that defines Richard's music, it's her grand, sweeping feelings that she lays bare for all to see and hear. <i>Blackheart</i> takes it down a peg from the mythology of <i>Goldenhear</i><i>t</i> into a more introspective, earthy realm—that it's wrapped up in inventive production that feels about five years ahead of mainstream radio is just icing on the cake. She begins the album howling ""I thought I lost it all"" into the void, but by the end, it feels like she found herself, and her voice, again—<i>Blackheart</i> is the singular, visionary work that she's been hinting at since she struck out on her own post-Diddy in 2011.</p></div>"|20104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20104-blackheart/|8.0|Andrew Ryce

A relentless microscope now fixates upon the city, waiting expectantly for the next <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"">2 Chainz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"">Gucci</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a>. Creative peaks and valleys are glossed over, a craggy history remembered as one long ascent, success a continually foregone conclusion. And so we end up with a ""flourishing"" young scene as rampant with speculation and opportunism as genuine creative talent. Although veterans (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki</a>, Gucci) pop up on Mike WiLL Made It's<i> Ransom</i> mixtape, it's mainly a showcase for rookies (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"">iLoveMakonnen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>) and aspiring stars (the various members of Two-9, Bankroll Fresh), eager to stake their claim on the city's storied history.</p>
<p>Much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19709-dj-mustard-10-summers/""><i>10 Summers</i></a> sat in the shadow of his work on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"">YG</a>'s much more successful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19164-yg-my-krazy-life/""><i>My Krazy Life</i></a>, <i>Ransom</i> feels like a supplement to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32655-rae-sremmurd/"">Rae Sremmurd</a>'s <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20113-sremmlife/""><i>SremmLife</i></a>. But where Mustard's sound remained consistent across his two major projects, Mike WiLL's Ear Drummers stable diverged sharply for this release. <i>SremmLife</i> is a jubilant pop record, packed with hooks and teeming with effervescent juvenile energy. But <i>Ransom</i> fits its stark black-and-leather cover art to a T. The production throughout, replete with minor-key piano loops and metallic textures, conjures up a sinister atmosphere, even when the rappers themselves pull away from this brooding mien.</p>
<p>Mike WiLL made a name for himself thanks to a counterintuitive taste for subtlety. In a time when clobbering, maximal Luger beats dominated the Down South mixtape circuit, Mike WiLL was drawn to subtle effects, like the way his use of EQ filtering and panning submerged listeners in the emotional space of a booming strip club record. On <i>Ransom</i>, the Ear Drummers production team is at its best when working towards a similarly crafted style, where use of space and attention to the details of timbre and atmosphere takes precedence. No other producers so precisely approximate tactile sensations. At their best, these beats evoke steam rising from steel.</p>
<p>The 21-track street tape can feel like something of an endurance test; the superstar-laden ""Buy the World"" displays the shortcomings of Mike WiLL's approach, an example of how easy it is to lose track of the forest while focusing so intently on the trees. In fact, it's the star vehicles which suffer the most; ""I Lied"", which also appeared on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20058-nicki-minaj-the-pinkprint/"">The Pinkprint</a></i>, aims for sincerity but feels like a detached approximation; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a> feature ""Don't Trust"" has the grim obligation of a winter commute. And unfortunately, a fizzy carbonation of the ""Choppin' Blades"" beat can't redeem <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30571-riff-raff/"">RiFF RAFF</a>'s loveless false advertising: ""Jody Highroller, anything can happen."" Nothing does.</p>
<p>Opener ""Paradise (Intro)"", an acrobatic feature for established star <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>, is a major exception. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31919-rich-homie-quan/"">Rich Homie Quan</a>'s ""Hasta Lauego"" conveys the kind of heartfelt candor that would have made an ideal closer. Future's three appearances are all exceptional standouts from an artist not always remembered for his lyrics. But despite a spotty hit rate, it's novice performers who dominate the highlight reel, glimmering in the tape's portentous tunnel vision.</p>
<p>Newcomer Bankroll Fresh has been on the receiving end of a fair amount of hype, with Atlanta on the lookout for a new street rap auteur. Thus far, Bankroll's dry, unadorned style has been easy to appreciate but hard to love. Thanks to dynamic production from Mike WiLL and Pluss, ""Screen Door"" transforms a familiar dope boy story into an unpredictable noir—a standout in the rapper's diminutive catalog. On Yung Joey and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32502-dej-loaf/"">Dej Loaf</a>'s ""Possible"", Mike WiLL and JBo weave an enigmatic canvas through layered chimes, letting the stars move with confidence in an air of wavering uncertainty. And while ""ethereal"" might be one of music criticism's most abused words, no term better captures the queasy anxiety of Swae Lee and Future's ""Drinks On Us"", the album's best song.</p>
<p>At its best, <i>Ransom </i>feels like an album-length exploration of the sound Mike WiLL established with 2014's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16612-future-move-that-dope-ft-pharrell-pusha-t-and-casino/"">""Move That Dope""</a>. But with doubt and ambiguity as its primary tonal colors, <i>Ransom</i> is a tough recommendation front to back. Few will last the numbing trek through its extended running time, and some of its stronger moments are liable to fall through the cracks. Nonetheless, it's encouraging to see a producer willing to go out on a limb for the new and developing generation at a time when a click-driven press is so attentive to established legacy artists.</p></div>"|20125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20125-ransom/|6.7|David Drake

But rather than go for bigger beats or more epic statements, he seems content to just make crafty yet understated tracks, touching on boogie, Balearic, cosmic disco, ambient, and leftfield dance music without ever alighting on one place too long. There’s an underlying attitude to the music that makes you think that Ruscha’s side project <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/2815669-Blas%C3%A9-3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blasé</a> might just be truth in advertising.</p>
<p><i>Cosmic Vibrations—</i>despite the spaciness of its title—is at its most delightful the closer it stays to <i>terra firma</i>. The second compilation of tracks culled from a run of cassettes self-released between 1996 and 2012, <i>Vibrations</i> isn’t too different in feel to 2012’s <i>Tropical Psychedelics</i>, though the beats all feel a bit looser the second time around, less concerned with getting your feet to move than your head to nod. Opener ""Out West"" features the kind of slow, sputtering drum machine that could be bought from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6280-sly-stone/"">Sly Stone</a>’s yard sale, Ruscha then adding analog keys and a reverberating guitar lifted from a desert noir, ample echo applied to all components until at one point they blur into a haze.</p>
<p>As opposed to <i>Tactile Galactics</i> and <i>Tropical Psychedelics</i>, the tracks aren’t wholly dependent on old analog synthesizers for their melodies as instead Ruscha adds licks of guitar to the mix. Much like his sometimes collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31554-luke-wyatt/"">Torn Hawk</a>, he processes and compresses the strings until they take on strange new quicksilver shapes. Around the tribal thump of ""Cartusian Log Book"" are picked guitar lines—run through effects until their notes resemble bubbles from an upturned water cooler jug—which turn to ripples on the surface of the track. Another twanging set of exotic strings sync with the machine clicks of ""Minimal Vibrations"".</p>
<p>On most of his tracks, there’s a feel not unlike a pied bunch of genres of all different colors all wadded up into a big Play-Doh ball, which at times makes tracks gum up into something not quite as distinct as its components. ""Straightline"" uses a shuffling digital reggae beat and shoots it through with backwards guitars and Ruscha’s own murmured vocals, the effect not unlike an Alan Parsons Project outtake. ""Nova Laser"" is a pleasant enough groove of an instrumental, but in light of other L.A.-based producers of a similar ilk (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32122-benedek/"">Benedek</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30659-suzanne-kraft/"">Suzanne Kraft</a> or <a href=""http://www.stonesthrow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stones Throw</a> folks) the track feels unfinished. A guitar sears across the tropical hot dog marimbas of ""Somnambulation"" yet the track just wanders away after engaging you.</p>
<p>Had <i>Inherent Vice</i> been set a bit deeper in the 1970s, Ruscha could have provided the perfect soundtrack to sync with those washed-out SoCal vibes, stoned yet groovy. Yet on standouts like the hummed-harmony chug of ""She Got Love"" (which sounds like a '70s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">Beach Boys</a> outtake tweaked by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>) and ""Shockers"", Ruscha weds outer space phasers to an irresistible cosmic disco thump, concocting a psychedelic level of synergy that would make any Californian glow.</p></div>"|20117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20117-cosmic-vibrations/|7.4|Andy Beta

After being battered with a weekend of booze and an especially pulverizing set from the war metal group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10666-revenge/"">Revenge</a>, their performance took on semi-psychedelic qualities. Their identities remain unknown, which is not all that unusual for a black metal group, but their singer was unmistakable, resembling a zombified '70s John McLaughlin with longer hair and a creepier disposition. Ascension played as if they were not only trying to lift the crowd out of Sunday sloth, but also trying to redeem them in a blackened fashion. That they played under a white tent only added to the black metal revival vibe. Even if they weren't consciously trying to be weird, it was one of the strangest performances of the fest that year.</p>
<p>Ascension's actual work isn't <i>quite</i> that trippy. Their 2010 debut full-length <i>Consolamentum</i> was an interesting hybrid of black metal, noise, and spindly guitar work; for a young group, they showed plenty of ambition. With <i>The Dead of the World</i>, Ascension have cut back on some of the more far-flung aspects of their debut in favor of a more streamlined sound, building on an early 2000s Swedish black metal approach pioneered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5895-watain/"" target=""_blank"">Watain</a> and Ofermod. This focus favors them in some ways, but they're still holding themselves back from making a real impact.</p>
<p>""Deathless Light"" was released as a single in October, and it is easily the strongest song on the record. That opening salvo is where they embrace their black metal roots the most, trance-like and utterly destructive all at once. Drums lull and pulsate; guitars twist in spiky knots without becoming needlessly complex. All of this is Ascension taking their name seriously: this is music for a one-way cannon shot to a higher plane. Some of the lead work from <i>Consolamentum</i> also returns on ""Light"", and while saying that the rest of the record is undeveloped would be false, this song feels the most thought-out and rightfully executed of them all.</p>
<p>Right before ""Light"" is ""Unlocking Tiamat"", whose overt doominess and mid-paced, chunky intro chords could have been something off a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32169-triptykon/"" target=""_blank"">Triptykon</a> record. Interestingly enough, Triptykon guitarist V. Santura assisted in recording and mastering <i>Dead</i>, and with a fuller production, the doomier sections, which have a much greater presence on this album, work. Even with a more unified sound, they don't sap energy from the album as a whole. ""Death's Golden Temple"" also carries a blackened Triptykon vibe, though the vocalist doesn't attempt to replicate the uncanny vocals of Tom G. Warrior. The slower passages also feel more mournful, as a way of crying for the loss of LSK, a veteran of the French black metal scene who contributed vocals to <i>Consolamentum</i> and took her own life in October 2013.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Dead</i> is a frustrating record, one that finds the band on the cusp of making something truly great. While consistency and better production do work in Ascension's favor, some of the spontaneity of the first record would have been rendered even more powerfully here. A singular focus won't help if that focus is not at its most intense; Ascension don't half-ass it, they're just at the edge.</p></div>"|20127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20127-the-dead-of-the-world/|7.0|Andy O'Connor

It’s not so much about a single artist as a whole scene. Over the last couple of years, the label has released a number of concert recordings capturing the bests acts in—or intimately involved with—the Bay Area’s garage and psych-rock community, including sets from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32288-obn-iiis/"">OBN IIIs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"">White Fence</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2143-icky-boyfriends/"">Icky Boyfriends</a>. The performances are usually recorded to a Tascam 388 tape machine, which imbues the recordings with a grit-heavy feel that’s not too distant from the band’s ""studio"" albums. </p>
<p>Ty Segall Band’s <i>Live in San Francisco</i> is the fifth installment in the series. This isn’t his first live record (that was 2011’s <i>Live in Aisle Five</i>) and it’s not even his first appearance in the series (his prog-loving side project, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31237-fuzz/"">Fuzz</a>, was also included), but it's an important addition. Along with Castle Face co-founder John Dwyer and his band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, Segall was a defining voice in the city's late '00s garage rock bubble and he and Dwyer are also, arguably, its most popular exports. And while it’s clear that Segall is prolific—he’s put out a double LP and a singles collection just within the last six months—this record isn’t filler.</p>
<p>Like a garage-rock version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>, Segall performs almost all of the music on his LPs alone, yet his live band—which includes drummer Emily Rose Epstein, guitarist Charles Mootheart, and bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"">Mikal Cronin</a>—is no joke. Having toured extensively for the last four years, they’ve tightened up into a be-all, end-all rock'n'roll group with the volatility and spirit to match choice '70s sweathogs like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKatVlwYPJA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Coloured Balls</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ddg7OXoupA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Groundhogs</a>.</p>
<p>The set list draws heavily from 2011’s full-band album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/""><i>Slaughterhouse</i></a>, along with a few of the heavier cuts from the last handful of Segall’s solo records. These live takes are, for the most part, harsher, nastier, and faster than their studio versions. The song ""Feel"" appeared on last year’s double LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19668-ty-segall-manipulator/""><i>Manipulator</i></a> with a considerably more polished presentation. The version on <i>Live in San Francisco </i>is unhinged—abandoning nuance for five minutes of gale force choogle.</p>
<p>Some of the other entries in Castle Face’s live series have encouraged spontaneity via covers or drawn-out jams. Regrettably, there’s not much of that to be found on <i>Live in San Francisco</i>. Here Segall and his band perform the songs pretty much as written, only louder. It isn't Segall's best record, but it's worthwhile if only in that it documents the whole crew playing together at the peak of their ability.</p>
<p>And because, you know, why stop there: this month also sees the release of Segall’s <i>Mr. Face </i>EP.

Given its ambient sound and comparatively basic hip-hop loops, the side project felt less ambitious than Baths, but also less theatrical, less constructed, and overall, like a more comfortable listening experience. Last July, after a three year hiatus, Wiesenfeld once again started releasing music as Geotic, this time in service of a trilogy of albums referred to collectively as <i>Eon Isle.</i></p>
<p>But while the first album in the series, <i>Morning Shore</i>, may have seemed like a throwback to that comfortable sound, Wiesenfeld had transformed Geotic; no longer a release from the creative strain that clearly went into Baths, it was now a challenge unto itself. Each <i>Eon Isle </i>album is constructed from the sounds of a single instrument. <i>Morning Shore</i> was all guitar. The second album in the trilogy, <i>Sunset Mountain</i>, which came out last month, consists entirely of vocals and nothing more. (The final album, <i>Evening Sky,</i> due next spring, will be made from piano.)</p>
<p>While the trilogy has a clear sense of exploration in common with its Geotic predecessors, it also finds Wiesenfeld on more of a mission. Albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15037-mend/""><i>Mend</i></a> found him happily meandering, but the restrictions he’s imposed on himself both on <i>Morning Shore </i>and on <i>Sunset Mountain</i> can make it seem as if he’s throwing down a kind of creative gauntlet, a test to be overcome. That’s particularly true on <i>Sunset Mountain. </i>Though the human voice is at least as flexible an instrument as the guitar, for whatever reason, Wiesenfeld restrains himself here more so than he did on the last record.</p>
<p>The result is an even more technically impressive set of compositions, which find Wiesenfeld constructing vocal cathedrals—tracks whose complexity is such that it becomes entirely possible to forget that the entire thing is voice and voice alone. ""Hidden Springs, Floating Leaves"" sounds as if it was written for a choir—the variety of voices layered around each other in different registers is staggering in its breadth, even when you forget that it's all Wiesenfeld. ""Reach the Broad Expanse"" shows equal range, as Wiesenfeld roughs up one version of his voice, letting his lowest tone provide a floor for the track while other iterations of his voice float toward the sky.</p>
<p>A characteristic shared by Baths and Geotic are the two projects’ intense sensuality. In much of his music, Wiesenfeld comes off as almost carnal, a man obsessed with the way things feel and taste. For that reason, the music on his new record, even when angelic in melody, can come across as decidedly more deviant. It is gothic in a way that is less sober Bavarian hymnal and more ""The Turn of the Screw"".</p>
<p>Indeed, while monks do appear in one of the album’s best tracks, they are described as being ""off somewhere,"" and there is a lilting sweetness to the singing here that is less mournful and more satisfied-sounding. ""Hidden Springs, Floating Leaves"" makes use of that same wicked vocal style that fans will recognize from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18065-baths-obsidian/""><i>Obsidian</i></a>, and even ""Piggybacking"", with its heavenly spiral stair patterns, comes off as somewhat sexual. (Though it may just be that the song’s title is reminiscent of the ""sweet swine"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15336-baths-ironworks/"">""Ironworks""</a><i>, </i>the one engaged in ""tempestuous foreplay."")</p>
<p>Without any instrument available to keep time (thankfully, Wiesenfeld does not beatbox here) the album suffers from significant problems with pacing. Some of the tracks here retain a remarkable sense of momentum, the kind usually created by the presence of a beat. ""We Can Conquer Small Fears"" is an early example; the track is patterned to the point where it’s easy to detect its natural rhythm. But several falter. True to its name, ""Slow Fading Heat"" is a slow, fading bore, one of more than a few songs here that lull you into forgetting about the creative talent behind them even when your attention is fully focused on them.</p>
<p>And that’s ultimately the key issue with <i>Sunset Mountain. </i>This sort of formal experiment fades a little when you ignore the process and consider the end-result. It’s impressive that Wiesenfeld is able to magic this music out of such a limited tool-set but at the same time, imposing those kinds of gimmicky limitations may be keeping Wiesenfeld from dealing with knottier artistic puzzles.  Since his best album to date, <i>Obsidian</i>, was released in 2013, he’s made a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19317-baths-ocean-death-ep/"">single EP</a> as Baths. While Geotic is pretty, diverting, and shows a prodigious formal skill, the end product, in spite of its process, lacks the drive and ambition of the artist’s best work. It ends up feeling like something of a practice session, albeit one of a very talented athlete, a grueling workout for the even more challenging event still to come.</p></div>"|20114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20114-sunset-mountain/|6.4|Jonah Bromwich

On <i>Unmoored by the Wind</i>, Kayla Cohen, a.k.a. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30820-itasca/"" target=""_blank"">Itasca</a>, spends much of her time navigating between those two states. Her folk-derived style is one that seems necessarily borne from many hours spent in solitude and quiet contemplation. And though this solitude has clearly given Cohen the space to perfect her instrumental craft and to revel in the rhythms of the natural world, there is also a subtle tug of melancholy coursing through many of these songs that speaks to a sense of displacement and a yearning for community or connection.</p>
<p><i>Unmoored by the Wind</i> is Cohen’s second album proper under the Itasca name, following a string of CD-R and cassette releases, including several mystic drone and experimental works that she recorded under the name <a href=""http://sultan.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sultan</a>. On this album her work can be classified as a much more straightforward form of homespun folk. Cohen’s delicate and expert fingerpicking places her work somewhere in the area of American Primitive, a genre that can always stand to benefit from additional female performers. But on <i>Unmoored by the Wind</i>, her vocals are an even bigger draw. She has a voice that is at once striking and vaguely familiar, the type of voice that will send folk-nerds to rack their memories to decide which other obscure or semi-obscure singer she most resembles. (I’m going with Bridget St. John and/or Sibylle Baier for now.)</p>
<p>Recorded at her home in Los Angeles, the album features the occasional flutter of flute or overdubbed vocal, but is otherwise built almost exclusively on Cohen’s voice and acoustic guitar. She does a fine job of balancing the album’s lyric and instrumental passages, and constructs her songs with enough textural variety and narrative energy that the album’s momentum never flags despite the simplicity of its production. Aside from such baroque interludes as ""Colt in Hiding"", which features multi-tracked layers of angelic vocals, the album’s overall tone is one of conversational intimacy, and it is not difficult for listeners to feel as if we’ve been invited to pull up a chair right there in the room with her, with the shades partially drawn.</p>
<p>This never feels more literally true than on the prayer-like ""After Dawn"", which finds the singer sitting quietly by her window watching as the sunlight changes and people flow past. It’s as though she is viewing the world and its human activities from a distant remove, a meditative sort of self-imposed seclusion that is further echoed on such tracks as the pastoral ""The Hermit’s View"" or the dreamy instrumental idyll of ""Walking in Hahamongna"".</p>
<p>Elsewhere, however, this sense of isolation from the world grows a bit more pronounced. On the narcotic ""Dream of the Water Bearer"", the song’s narrator, beset by mysterious dream figures, helplessly waves her hands in the air ""just to see if I could change the picture."" Similar dream figures appear in ""Nature’s Gift"", images that ""seem as if I’ve called them here"" although she is unable to determine how ""these angels can help me out.""</p>
<p>When the dreamy cobwebs clear away, as on the wake-up call ""Alleyway"" (""I walk out my door to find the world same as it was before"") and especially on the radiant ""Congregation"", Cohen writes personal pep-talks with the lucidity and clarity of a self-help manual, variously singing ""I’ve got to change my ways"" or ""I’ve got to find my hopeful place to rest"" like she is writing lines in a private journal. This feeling that we, as listeners, have been granted access into Itasca’s private inner sanctum is what helps give <i>Unmoored by the Wind</i> its quiet gravity, and her ample instrumental skills and deft songcraft make this invitation well worth your while. </p></div>"|20115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20115-unmoored-by-the-wind/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

<p>Like T-Pain, with whom he appeared on ""I’m 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)"", Jones has been quietly climbing back up his reputation cliff with a series of lower-profile, solid releases. ""Where’s Mike Jones? I heard he back to runnin’ shit!"" he proclaimed on 2011's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP8AtsWYztA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Leanin On Dat Butter""</a>, and while that certainly wasn’t true, the song was another notch in a long comeback campaign.<i></i></p>
<p><i>The Money Train</i>, a mixtape dropped at the start of the New Year, is probably his most visible solo project since 2009, but it’s not much different from his other work. He very loosely approximates Quavo’s jumpy, bunched-up delivery on ""On My Momma"" and ""Hallelujah"". ""Call Me When You Need Me"" and ""What We On"" feature digitally processed singsong that faintly echoes Chicago bop, but otherwise Jones doesn’t have much to offer to rap-listening kids who are probably too young to remember ""Still Tippin'"".</p>
<p>The people Jones seems to be aiming for with <i>Money Train</i> are his old fans, people now in their 30s, who wonder what the hell happened to him. His next album, after all, is called <i>Where’s Mike Jones?</i>, but ""What Happened to"" would have made just a suitable name. He drops a few verses on ""I Remember"" that hint at his struggle and his come-up, but unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7337-t-pain/"">T-Pain</a>, who returned with <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/11/06/t-pain-premieres-epic-first-song-from-upcoming-album-stoicville"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a searing take on his post-fame exile</a>, Jones has nearly nothing to say about where Mike Jones is, or what happened to him. He could have spoken on losing hundreds of pounds, weathering AIDS rumors, falling out with Paul Wall and others, and starting from square one, but Jones has never been interested in autobiography apart from ""back then, hoes didn’t want me.""</p>
<p><i>Money Train</i> is a well-made project: The viscous, fluttering ""Foreign Whips"", produced by DJ Plugg, is moody and rich. Along with ""Let Me Show You"" and ""Champaigne Music"", you can hear Jones mixing some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>’s melancholy into the tarry, slow-moving Houston mix that he has borrowed so much from. But the tape has a generic, stamped feel that makes it hard to care about. People moved by mild curiosity to download it will probably nod approvingly, but Mike Jones never did much as an artist besides exist, which is maybe why he also disappeared so easily in the first place. </p></div>"|20109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20109-money-train/|6.8|Jayson Greene

They were one of the few groups that did something different with the basic tools of what was then called grunge. Red Red Meat were on <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a> and they toured with hometown friends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, but they were one of those indie bands that never really had a chance at the big time. They were too insular, too weird, they didn’t look very interesting on camera. But they made four fine records and the last of these, 1997’s <i>There’s a Star Above the Manger Tonight</i>, has been lovingly reissued.</p>
<p>This wasn’t Red Red Meat’s best record—that honor goes to its predecessor, 1995’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12871-bunny-gets-paid-deluxe-edition/""><i>Bunny Gets Paid</i></a>, which gets over purely on the strength of its songwriting. Almost every cut on <i>Bunny</i> still sounds like a bent rock classic. <i>Star Above the Manger</i>, on the other hand, is an album about <i>sound</i>, the place where Red Red Meat fully discovered the studio-as-instrument. One of the reasons the music press loved so much of '90s alternative rock is because it was heard as moving ""back to the basics"": loud guitars, heavy drums, and a singer howling in torment. From one angle, it was a conservative movement. Red Red Meat provided an interesting twist on this template with an intent focus on technology. Based in Chicago in the '90s, Red Red Meat were well aware of what bands in what would eventually come to be called post-rock were doing. The ideas of manipulating a gnarly guitar riff with a computer and snapping beats to a grid were not out of the question. All of those ideas came into full flower on <i>Star Above the Manger</i>. For as much crunchy, blues-based riffing as is going on here, <i>Star</i> feels like it’s happening inside of a computer. The band themselves were drawing inspiration from Teo Macero’s work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"">Miles Davis</a>, seeing how fragments of live jamming could be altered and re-edited into something new. The result is an album that, even now, 18 years later, still sounds remarkably fresh and like little else.</p>
<p>The ultra-stiff drums on ""Chinese Balls"" are one example among many of what makes this record unusual: on one level, it sounds like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">Stones</a>-y rock song, with trebly chords and slide guitar, but the rhythmic undercurrent is pure Man-Machine, even though the individual drum hits sound ""live."" The title track smashes old against new in a different but still intriguing way, with a violin and banjo that are all pinched midrange, bringing to mind the thin response of a 78 that might wind up on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/313-the-anthology-of-american-folk-music-as-physical-artifact/""><i>The Anthology of American Folk Music</i></a>. But the layered voices and particulars of the mix sound thoroughly contemporary, with small details that would have never occurred to someone hearing music before the advent of multi-track. On ""Second Hand Sea"", one of the most beautiful ballads Tim Rutili has written, the banjo is midrange-heavy and in an unusual tuning, sounding more like a Chinese <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18Uttg-RRIU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">qinqin</a>, and it traces the delicate melody as bassy throbs of percussion crash like waves on a shore, while the instrumental ""Paul Pachal"" moves from tense surges of guitar and malleted drums to something approaching pure noise music. You can never quite tell where you are inside this album—depression-era blues, early-'70s arena rock, downtown post-punk, early laptop era—and all the sounds and techniques swirl together, resulting in something beautifully disorienting.</p>
<p>For the reissue, boutique label <a href=""http://www.jealousbutcher.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jealous Butcher</a> have commissioned a new cover by John Herndon of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>, pressed the records on bright orange vinyl, and have also included a variation on the song-specific artwork (also by Herndon) included with the original release. The latter is an especially nice touch, as the projects of Red Red Meat and their various offshoots always had the aura of the found object, that feeling when you confront something interesting without all the necessary context and figure out the story by working backwards. The bonus tracks, the usual assortment of outtakes, flesh out the story, and demonstrate that this was indeed a fertile period of exploration for the band. The highlight among them is the version of ""Welcome Christmas"", the B-side on the title track’s 7''. It’s a version of the song sung in Whoville during the climactic scene of <i>How The Grinch Stole Christmas</i>. Between this cover and the one of ""There’s Always Tomorrow"", from ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"", off <i>Bunny</i>, Red Red Meat out themselves as a band with a sentimental streak about the holiday season, not unlike that of fellow travelers the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">Flaming Lips</a>, another group that did something strange and compelling within the confines of '90s alt rock. Red Red Meat never had a chance to be anywhere near that huge and probably would have blown it if they had, but their records hold up as well as any of the bands they were lumped with.</p></div>"|19948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19948-theres-a-star-above-the-manger-tonight/|8.0|Mark Richardson

The result was <i>Atlas Eclipticalis</i>, an unusual attempt at capturing the music of the spheres. He repeated the technique in 1974 for <i>Etudes Australes</i>, a set of short, blindingly difficult piano pieces he composed—or transcribed, anyway, with the help of the <i>I Ching</i>—for the pianist Grete Sultan. In a <a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9402E3DA1731E034BC4F51DFB766838E669EDE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1975 review</a> in the <i>New York Times</i>, John Rockwell drew a comparison to Arnold Schoenberg's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">12-tone method</a>, noting that ""the music sounded almost serial, in a lazily erratic sort of way. The process of its creation reflects Mr. Cage's all-embracing mysticism, but one result is to insure a harmonic randomness that Schoenberg sought by far different means.""</p>
<p>In the intervening years, as the world has been plotted across every type of map and grid imaginable, such translations of data points to musical values have become commonplace. Tobias Frere-Jones' ""F-Hz (#190736, 1996)"" gathered a year's worth of high and low temperature readings from the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory in Milton, Massachusetts, and converted them from Fahrenheit to hertz. On the 2000 album <i>Traceroute</i>, the noise collective UBSB (Zbigniew Karkowski, Atau Tanaka, Edwin Van Der Heide, and Ulf Bilting) created a Unix software agent that eavesdropped on Internet communications before translating that mass of data into abrasive noise. And in 2011, a multimedia project called the Radioactive Orchestra paired the electronic musician Axel Boman with a group of nuclear physicists to generate musical patterns from the behavior of radioactive isotopes.</p>
<p>The latest addition to this canon of data-oriented music making comes from James Murphy—well, strictly speaking, from James Murphy, IBM, the advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the ""visual storytelling"" brand agency Tool, and all of the players in the 2014 U.S. Open. Last summer, as a demonstration of IBM's cloud-computing might, data scientists from Tool worked with Murphy to create generative music, in real time, out of all 187 matches in the tennis tournament. Excerpts of the results are available on IBM's <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ibm/sets"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SoundCloud</a> page, and while it's difficult to discern much about their methodology from the music itself, we know from <a href=""http://www.fastcocreate.com/3035202/the-sound-of-tennis-how-ibm-and-james-murphy-made-music-from-the-us-open"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> with the project's masterminds that basic variables like pitch, timbre, and tempo were determined by players' names and seeds, temperature, court names, etc., and that game data—game score, set score, time between points, and ""significant events"" like aces and point breaks—determined the shape of the music as the games played out.</p>
<p>If you've listened to a few of the excerpts, you may have noticed that a little bit of this goes a long way, at least as a listening experience. (Apparently the audio was initially live-streamed as the matches played out, along with complementary visuals that parsed additional data points from the tournament.) It sounds a little like a Casiotone with the hiccups, or a small animal walking over the controls of a sequencer. A few of them are mildly unpleasant to listen to; on ""Match 6, Round 1"", some variable or another has given the sound a harsh, distorted edge, suggesting an etude written on crumpled tinfoil. Others are more absorbing: ""Match 104, Round 2"" is animated by lively swing and odd little call-and-response motifs; ""Match 184, Men's Semifinals"" is both placid and quietly stylish, as though a computer virus had hybridized the back catalogs of Windham Hill and Smallville. But only a crazy person would listen to them all. For the most part, they recede into the background, like wind chimes—or at least windchimes rigged, via strings and pulleys, to a metronome.</p>
<p>For the final step in this long, lazy volley between humans and machines, James Murphy has remixed various segments from the tournament into a dozen discrete tracks. A few of them, like ""Match 186 Set 1"", don't sound much less aimless than their raw material, but that's also not a criticism; especially at these more manageable lengths, that meandering quality is part of their appeal. In general, though, Murphy's guiding hand has become visible as he selects key motifs and reworks them into arrangements resembling techno or ambient music. ""Match 4"", displaying Murphy's fondness for Carl Craig, features steady Roland drum programming, a grinding bass arpeggio, and a dramatic breakdown, complete with congas. The breakbeat under ""Match 104"" brings vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> to mind. In ""Match 184"", harpsichord-like plucks are fleshed out with a doleful 303 line and a slow, four-to-the-floor kick drum, and the results sound uncannily like Tin Man's mournful, drifting acid. The electro-disco ditty ""Match 185"" might almost be an early sketch from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10017-sound-of-silver/""><i>Sound of Silver</i></a> sessions, while the closing ""Match 187""—with plucked arpeggios beating against buoyant choral pads—takes the whole collection out on a high, hopeful note.</p>
<p>This isn't a major work for Murphy, which I think is implicit in the fact that it's been given away for free. But, particularly when compared with the truly random raw data that was his source material, it has plenty of charm. Whether or not the original feed tells us anything about tennis, as he coaxes data points into patterns, and massages happenstance into meaningful events, we learn at least one thing about Murphy: this guy can make music out of virtually anything.</p></div>"|20103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20103-remixes-made-with-tennis-data/|6.9|Philip Sherburne

Rarer is the revival that goes beyond nostalgia and sets itself up to be eventually revived in its own right. I keep seeing the phrase ""Balearic"" used in different ways, so let's be clear: For our purposes, the term refers to a late-1980s style linked to Ibiza, where clattering acid house had given way among some DJs to a mellower, more eclectic mindset that made room for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SaBnTqIRFM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">extended Cure remixes</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PxJNkoeWi8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Italo-house krautrock appropriations</a>—and Chris Rea's soft-rock guitar workout <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbCmMaqG8_Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Josephine""</a>. But the scene was never limited to Spain, and by the mid- to late '00s a Balearic revival had taken hold, much of it centered in Scandinavian groups, not least of them a Gothenburg-based duo known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5126-studio/"" target=""_blank"">Studio</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27424-d-lissvik/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Lissvik</a>, aka <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/atelje"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atelje</a>, was one half of Studio. What he accomplished with collaborator Rasmus Hägg around that time, especially on 2006's <i>West Coast</i> (and 2007's somewhat-overlapping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9898-yearbook-1/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yearbook 1</i> compilation</a>), looms larger now that we've had some years to see how singular it was. You can spot traces of their aesthetic, musically and visually, in minimalist electronic producer Nicolas Jaar's work with guitarist Dave Harrington as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30070-darkside/"" target=""_blank"">Darkside</a>, and you can find other cosmic guitar instrumentalists not unlike Lissvik, most notably former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"" target=""_blank"">Mark McGuire</a>. But Studio had a particular way of blending largely Balearic elements and exploring them, sometimes at great length, while also maintaining enough sly conceptual unity, enough tunefulness, for easy first-impression appeal. Last year, in a measure of Studio's enduring influence, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a> sampled <i>West Coast</i>/<i>Yearbook 1</i>'s ""Out There"" for his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54887-jamie-xx-releases-new-song-girl/"" target=""_blank"">""Girl""</a> single. </p>
<p>Lissvik has stayed busy, but Studio called it quits and shut down their label, Information, at the beginning of 2012. That farewell was part of a broader moment of closure for the scene: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a>, who took a more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank"">Saint Etienne</a>- and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"" target=""_blank"">Avalanches</a>-leaning approach toward the Balearic idea, broke up not long after, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49362-rip-service-swedish-label-behind-jens-lekman-tough-alliance-studio-whitest-boy-alive/"" target=""_blank"">Service</a>, the Gothenburg label that nurtured Studio and others in the early '00s, gave up the ghost in January 2013. Since 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11923-yearbook-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yearbook 2</i></a>, a comp containing Studio reworkings of other artists' songs, Hägg has done production for gut-wrenching Swedish singer-songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4788-el-perro-del-mar/"" target=""_blank"">El Perro Del Mar</a>, and in 2013 he <a href=""http://blogg.svt.se/psl/2013/10/02/rasmus-haggs-musik-ar-stulen-ge-tillbaka-den-genast/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told an interviewer</a> he'd lost four to five solo albums in a burglary. Lissvik has been the more publicly prolific, showcasing his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"" target=""_blank"">Vini Reilly</a>-goes-to-warmer-climes instrumentals on a late-2008 solo album as D. Lissvik,  <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12653-7-trx-intermission/"" target=""_blank"">7 Trx + Intermission</a>, </i>and teaming up with Fredrik Lindson of fellow Service alums <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12665-the-embassy/"" target=""_blank"">the Embassy</a> for a charmingly low-key 2009 LP as the Crêpes—that is, when not producing for the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28811-ceo/"">CEO</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5330-taken-by-trees/"" target=""_blank"">Taken by Trees</a>, or remixing everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27589-fever-ray/"" target=""_blank"">Fever Ray</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a>.</p>
<p><i>Meditation</i> is the most Studio-like full-length we've heard from Lissvik since his former band. That not-quite-reggae lope is back, along with hypnotic yet lyrical guitar repetitions, dubwise bass, and Nordic space-disco synths. As ever with Balearic, part of the formula is that there is no formula, as seen in the twinkling piano on the album's bookends ""Ode to Studio"" and ""Awake"" (the latter with strummy acoustic guitar). And those Studio-era yearning vocals are long gone. Still, when the LP gets into a cosmic groove, especially on side B's percolating ""Everslick"" or its gentle, piano-sprinkled comedown ""Transition"", the effect recalls the Balearic revival at its peak. Considering, again, that the title of the opening track is ""Ode to Studio"", that might not be an accident.</p>
<p>Back-to-roots moves can be a bit hackneyed in rock, or at the very least seen as a bit of a retreat, but I don't get that sense here. It might help to remember that the original Balearic beat was as much about context as content: Rea's ""Josephine"" or, to take a Studio-remixed example, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2782-kylie-minogue/"" target=""_blank"">Kylie Minogue</a>'s ""2 Hearts"" belongs not because it was necessarily supposed to but simply because it can. <i>Meditation</i> plays as a thoroughly absorbing meditation on—or ode to—Studio, and it works because it does; there's still nothing else quite like this. With only 300 copies pressed, most of us probably won't be able to own the LP on vinyl, and at slightly more than half an hour, Lissvik doesn't quite get a chance to stretch out the way Studio could. But there's reason to hope for at least at least a personal musical revival: Diehard watchers of Studio will know Lissvik has shared 50 tracks, as <i>Archive</i>, on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/lissvik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his SoundCloud</a>, and a tantalizing new solo single, ""Airwalk"" b/w ""Shuvit"", is <a href=""http://boomkat.com/downloads/1173421-dan-lissvik-shuvit"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on the way</a> in February via <a href=""http://www.smalltownsupersound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smalltown Supersound</a>.

His debut album, <i>Wind</i>, self-released in 1986, is an understated gem that falls somewhere between Balearic ambient music and secular new age, with echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd/"">Harold Budd</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27976-jon-hassel/"">Jon Hassell</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6909-world-of-echo/""><i>World of Echo</i></a>. It's not terribly well known, but those who have heard it tend to be passionate about it. A former radio DJ, Masin has done other things over the years, including a 1989 split LP with This Heat's Charles Hayward, on Sub Rosa, and, in the '00s, a handful of recordings for small Italian labels. But he's remained largely under the radar. I had never heard of Masin until I encountered <i>Talk to the Sea</i>, released by the fledgling Amsterdam label <a href=""http://musicfrommemory.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Music From Memory</a>, but its impact was immediate—if ""impact"" is quite the right word for a sound so warmly, woozily amniotic, a sound entirely without hard surfaces or sharp edges.</p>
<p>Masin returns here as one-third of Gaussian Curve, a multi-generational ensemble that also includes the Scottish musician Jonny Nash, a founder of the <a href=""http://www.esp-institute.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ESP Institute</a> label and member of the synth-besotted softronica act Land of Light, and Amsterdam's Marco Sterk, better known for his woozy house productions under the Young Marco alias. Nash and Sterk first met Masin in the fall of 2013, and they wound up briefly jamming together in the house of a friend. The three musicians reconvened in Amsterdam in early 2014, and they ended up completing eight tracks in a single weekend. <i>Clouds</i> is the result of those sessions, and it's every bit as dreamlike as the musicians make the weekend sound. ""It was almost like we weren't involved,"" Nash told <a href=""http://www.junodownload.com/plus/2015/01/05/gaussian-curve-the-longest-road/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Juno Plus</a>. ""It just slipped out.""</p>
<p>The eight songs here, all instrumentals, feel less like standalone pieces than variations on a common theme. They share similar instrumentation, and they're all uniformly limpid and languid. Masin sets the tone, and the pace, with slow-moving chords on acoustic piano or Rhodes keyboard, while Nash and Sterk flesh out the songs with gently meandering electric guitar, wispy synthesizer pads, and, occasionally, trumpet and melodica. Given the trumpet, the music often brings to mind Jon Hassell's <i>Last Night the Moon Came Dropping Its Clothes in the Street</i>. A few songs feature rudimentary drum-machine programming, mostly just tuned toms and woodblocks, that might be mistaken for dripping faucets. To call it ""atmospheric"" would be an extreme understatement. (On the closing ""Red Light"", they hold a microphone out the studio window and record the voices and footfalls of the alley outside.) It probably bears as much in common with watercolor as it does most electronic music.</p>
<p>While the music unfolds with about as much drama as a smoke ring wafting towards the ceiling—about as much consequence, too—these are masterfully crafted mood pieces. In the opening ""Talk to the Church"", Masin mimics the chimes of a bell tower that loomed over the trio's studio, his chords gently bouncing and swaying, enlivened by millisecond-long syncopations and subtle shifts in volume. And despite the limited palette and the uniform tempos, they wisely change keys for virtually every song. So while the view remains the same, the light shifts, ever so subtly. True to the title, the experience of this short album, just 38 minutes long, feels a little like a time-lapse film of clouds crossing the sky—of day turning to night, and back again. With the closing ""Red Light"", the music returns to its original key, and it feels like things have come full circle. The logical response—my response, anyway—is to resume the cycle, and launch into the daybreak bells of ""Talk to the Church"" all over again.</p></div>"|20064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20064-clouds/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

On <i>Preacher’s</i> <i>Son</i>, Chattanooga rapper Tut inhabits this scene: the tape opens with a brief news item about police seeking the help of a church to capture a man accused of murder. Tut positions church as a place where a community comes together even in the most trying times. On ""Corner Stories"", he raps: ""Remember sitting in my uncle’s kitchen, I was 8, though/ Whipping up a little something for the pesos"" and then contrasts the scene to himself in the same house innocently playing with Legos. He spins a tale of a small-time drug dealer and a simple robbery that turns into something more complicated and touches on other community ills, and even when he restrains the narrative detail, he humanizes acts both right and wrong. </p>
<p><i>Preacher’s Son</i> is produced primarily by Ktoven and avoids common Southern rap styles (Snap or Swag) and trendy producers (Metro Boomin or Zaytoven). Ktoven creates lively and warm beats that recall when blues and funk were still embedded in Southern music's DNA, bringing to mind a time when hearing a horn section (""Hangin'"") or a guitar (""Holy Water"") was the norm, not an exception. The uniformity gives the tape a cumulative force, but some tracks towards the middle blend together as the style gets too comfortable within its own groove.</p>
<p>Tut struggles throughout trying to understand the issues that ail his community and figuring out what he should do, even as he's trying to avoiding repeating his own mistakes. The tape returns back to church with an excerpt of sermon on trying to decide whether one is just of this earthly world or joined the heavenly ranks of Christ and the Lord. Tut then closes with ""Sunday Service"", highlighting a great irony of church mornings in that so many in the pews just spent the night sinning (""Damn, we gotta hurry/ Late to the Sunday service/ Last night I hit the town/ Late, I was on the screw juice swervin'""). The track is also laced with light ad-libs from fellow Chattanooga rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31721-isaiah-rashad/"">Isaiah Rashad</a>, whose presence loomed heavily over the tape even if he was never officially mentioned. But where Rashad’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19014-isaiah-rashad-cilvia/""><i> Cilvia Demo </i></a>from last year appeared lost with its place in the world, <i>Preacher’s Son </i>knows where it stands within the church aisles. Tut just needs to pull his head up and decide which path to travel.</p></div>"|20124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20124-preachers-son/|7.3|David Turner

That might seem strange, considering he did not actually publish poems. Instead, he played guitar and wrote songs—not verse set to music, but rhyming lyrics with verses and choruses, delicate melodies and Romantic imagery. He was then what we might call today a singer-songwriter, but the '60s being the '60s, Harper and his friends Stephen John Kalinich and Mark Lindsey Buckingham had grander ambitions than simply strumming pop tunes or providing entertainment. Poetry was an aspiration, a true calling, a means of peeling away the veneer of society and exposing some hard human truths both beautiful and revolting.</p>
<p>At that time anyone could claim the mantle of poet, even if it no longer brought with it the perks enjoyed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Dylan</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9304-allen-ginsberg/"">Ginsberg</a>. In fact, before Harper signed with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1910-lee-hazlewood/"">Lee Hazlewood</a>’s LHI Records, he was living at the YMCA and sharing bags of potatoes with his friends. <i>Dreams and Images, </i>released under his first name to almost no fanfare, did not do much to change those conditions, and this reissue does not present it as a lost or unheralded classic, along the lines of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5009-karen-dalton/"">Karen Dalton</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9623-in-my-own-time/"">In My Own Time</a></i> or Patrick Haggerty’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19088-lavender-country-lavender-country/"">Lavender Country</a></i>. Instead, it’s another piece of the LHI puzzle that <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic</a> has been putting together for a few years now.</p>
<p>In that regard it’s a revealing artifact of that scene as well as a gentle statement of purpose by a struggling poet. According to the liner notes, Hazlewood assigned an arranger named Don Randi to beef up Harper’s songs, and to everyone’s credit, the additions are both odd and nonintrusive, lush and minimal: a bed of strings on opener ""Blue Museum"", an oboe riff on ""Children Once Were You"", what sounds like a clavier on ""Open Up the Door"". Such flourishes bolster the dreamlike quality of Harper’s songs, as though Randi intended them to be slightly surreal illustrations in an imagined chapbook.</p>
<p><i>Dreams and Images</i> reveals a poet very exacting in his craft, even if he seems to be still finding his voice. Harper’s lyrics are occasionally ponderous or oblique, but just as often he can be unnervingly direct (""I don’t know why/ There're tears in my eyes"") or darkly whimsical (""You look like a human chair""). On the other hand, some of these songs can’t survive outside the context in which they were written. ""Walking down the street is a sunshine soldier,"" he sings on ""Sunshine Soldier"". ""A child walks by and hands him a flower/ And that’s how love is begun."" Still, there is something radical about Harper’s naivety. His words never howl. Instead, they whisper.</p>
<p>Reinforcing that impression are Harper’s high, expressive voice and his precise guitar playing. The former lends a thoughtfulness to his delicate melodies and the latter frames every line as a soul-searching query. He was self-taught in both regards, favoring idiosyncratic phrasings and odd tunings that other musicians might find nonsensical. But the music lends some heft to the words and portrays a gentle personality behind the songs. Even when he’s singing about love and beauty and sunshine soldiers and maidens fair, he never sounds like just another folkie. It’s enough to make you wonder what he might have accomplished if he had pursued his muse further, but after <i>Dreams and Images</i> and one follow-up, he quit the music business, started a family, and took a 9-to-5 designing rocket engines. It’s an odd fate for any poet, especially one who made a virtue of having his head in the clouds. </p></div>"|20112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20112-dreams-and-images/|7.5|Stephen M.

No slight to the hype cycle-upending stunts they've pulled post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16512-death-grips-the-money-store/""><i>The Money Store</i></a><span>—</span>skipping highly anticipated shows (including Lollapalooza), holing up in the Chateau Marmont, sending every fan of theirs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17216-no-love-deep-web/"">a cover-art dickpic</a>, telling Epic to go screw, releasing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19472-death-grips-niggas-on-the-moon/"">an album</a> that was supposedly a legitimate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> collab but presumably merely sampled her voice, breaking up, ditching an opening gig for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a>, maybe not breaking up, and so forth. But even as the sound that made all this relevant in the first place got a fraction of the press as the crazy shit orbiting around it like noisy satellites, the music itself is more notable than the social media gimmickry. Anyone can be an aloof dildo on the Internet; not everyone could bring the trans-genre aggro bravado that those antics were meant to justify at a couple hundred kilobytes per second.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That said, it wouldn't be a Death Grips album without some weird mystery behind it, and </span><i>Fashion Week </i><span>has its share. For instance: someone of unknown origin and affiliation downloaded this entire album from some arcane private corner of Death Grips' website a few months back, posted it to the band's fan subreddit, and was widely dismissed as someone trying to pass off a fraudulent leak. Then Death Grips, or a representative thereof, actually posted the album on Soundcloud to prove its legitimacy, gave it a track listing that spelled out ""JENNYDEATHWHEN"" as a taunting acknowledgement of their supposed last album's all-question-marks release date, and then went off to do who the hell knows what else.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Leaving hungry listeners with some scraps to pick over means that what might be a stopgap release in the context of any other band is going to be pored over fiendishly by one of the more dedicated cult fanbases in music today. So </span><i>Fashion Week </i><span>is going to be put through the wringer, and there will be speculation about future direction. Maybe this is a bunch of scraps from the archives that hints at ideas they eventually strengthened and routes they could've taken instead, or maybe it's a few things Zach Hill scraped together to keep Death Grips in the public eye as </span><i>jenny death </i><span>struggles to life, or maybe it's an actual Fashion Week soundtrack some designer commissioned, or maybe it's even the instrumentals for </span><i>jenny death </i><span>itself, or maybe it's just some record.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Whatever it is, it's pretty bracing<span>—</span>not hellaciously noisy or completely impenetrable, but at least raucous enough to feel legit. That it was so readily dismissed as a hoax when it first leaked months ago gives you some idea of its quality, but what makes this record likable is still pretty elusive. You get careening invocations of trademark ideas all butting up next to each other, riding on sparking, hissing, glitching synthesizers and Zach Hill's drums rattling like a lost-time accident at the corrugated steel warehouse. And it really knocks in a surprising way when some distinct elements jump out through the familiar framework: feverishly lighthearted circus organ on the first ""Runway N"", occasionally abrasive but otherwise straightforward classic Detroit techno on ""Runway D"", a nasty, mud-trudging lope driven by oozing nightmare Moogs on the first ""Runway H"" that plays like a power struggle between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9830-tobacco/"">Tobacco</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6209-trent-reznor/"">Trent Reznor</a>. Hell, ""punk"" usually seems like a ""for lack of a better subculture"" term that gets thrown at Death Grips as a Gen-X dadrock assessment, but the second ""Runway H"" proves that if they wanted to, they could be this decade's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What <i>Fashion Week</i>'s really missing, though, is some kind of central idea—if anybody ever thought this music could melt steel without MC Ride acting as threat-slinging, dinosaur-lunged instrument of corrosion, they'll probably be let down. The album needs the percussive abrasion of his voice, and digging into some of the more typical slabs of Death Grips' instrumental tendencies doesn't unearth much more than a pretty solid workout soundtrack. It makes for a good exercise in how grimy and knuckles-out they can get even when going straight-up electro, but don't try and call ""Runway A"" or ""Runway W"" transgressive hardcore art when they barely transcend the possibility of sounding like decent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31319-run-the-jewels/"">Run the Jewels</a> outtakes. The titles aren't the only parts of the songs that spell out a question about what Death Grips' future is supposed to sound like, and don't expect answers to come easy.</p></div>"|20102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20102-fashion-week/|6.6|Nate Patrin

""I’d rather be hated for who I am than loved who I’m not any day,"" he told Mass Appeal recently, right after namedropping the Lumineers and admitting <i>The Notebook</i> made him cry (the book, not the movie). His <a href=""http://gawker.com/the-booty-eating-renaissance-1633706123"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Yeah I eat booty!"" rallying cry</a> on morning radio, right after being named an XXL Freshman, might have shifted the sexual politics of hardcore rap entirely by itself.</p>
<p>He might not always behave admirably, and in fact sometimes he’s <a href=""http://theboombox.com/kevin-gates-attack-jhonni-blaze-instagram/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">being repulsive</a>—but he shares all of this behavior with us, in his music and on social media, with a shrug and a sigh. When he discovered recently that a woman he’d been ""fuckin' with"" was, in fact, his cousin—something he’d been alerted to by his own grandmother—he took to Instagram to recount the experience to his fans and announce that he had no plans to stop fucking her. ""You done already got the hard part out the way,"" <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2015/01/09/kevin-gates-having-sex-with-cousin-dating-rapper-instagram-video/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he offered</a> by way of explanation.</p>
<p>This radical, often-hilarious candor helps explains the fierceness of his grassroots fanbase, which propelled <i>Luca Brasi 2</i>, an available-for-free mixtape dropped just before New Year’s, to #38 on the Billboard Albums Chart. <i>Luca Brasi 2</i> is billed as a sequel to his 2013 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17808-kevin-gates-the-luca-brasi-story/"">breakout mixtape</a>, but it continues down the path that Gates has been paving for years. It leans a little towards melancholy than the harder, grimmer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18336-kevin-gates-stranger-than-fiction/""><i>Stranger Than Fiction</i></a>, but the differences are minor. It’s another dispatch from a well-known figure to his congregation, an update on a tumultuous life lived somewhere near the peak of the American rap underground.</p>
<p>Local-stardom details, like the discomfort he observes at his presence at the local barbershop, dot his lyrics, and give a feel for Gates as a big fish in a small pond, warily charting his home territory. His infant son, who often appears in his arms on his Instagram account, is a looming presence: ""Full time father, full time artist, ask God, he said 'Grind harder,'"" he announces proudly on ""I Don’t Get Tired"". His belchy, froggy voice melts from a bark into a tender singsong within the space of a half-bar, which gives his music its uniquely unsettled feel. Gates tends to stick to his rain-streaked, moody trap-rap sound from album to album, but he nonetheless always feels unpredictable on record. On the pitch-black, Bobby Johnson-produced ""Sit Down"", he raps in what sounds like four different voices at once.</p>
<p>His verses are full of ear-catching little non-sequiturs, like the ""Whuh?"" namechecks of <i>Forrest Gump</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14180-aerosmith/"">Aerosmith</a>’s ""Jaded"" on ""Perfect Imperfection"". But his most affecting moments remain the tender-rough love songs, like ""Wassup With It"", where he promises to kiss you in public and asks to ""hit that pussy one time"" in the same song. ""Would I be wrong to wanna fuck you with one of my niggas/ If afterward I promised I wouldn’t look at you different?"" he inquires respectfully on ""Wild Ride"". These are the moments when his particularly messy brand of honesty shines, and gives his music its humble warmth. Kevin Gates is a savvy rap songwriter and a gut-wrenching rapper, but his greatest achievement is more intangible: He feels like a person living inside his own records. </p></div>"|20059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20059-luca-brasi-2/|7.2|Jayson Greene

Most of his artists have one foot on the dancefloor and one foot elsewhere—the indie scene, the modular synth builders' club, the clouds—which is a pretty good approximation of the style of DJing that Alkan has practiced since the days of Trash, his fondly remembered club night from back in the days of electroclash.</p>
<p>At one end of the spectrum there's Tom Rowlands, of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">Chemical Brothers</a>, who offered up a pair of noise-besotted throwback acid-house tracks for the label; at the other end, Brazil's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28048-babe-terror/"">Babe, Terror</a>, whose fuzzy layers of looped vocals sound like doo-wop from a world spun off its axis. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31581-daniel-avery/"">Daniel Avery</a>'s sawtoothed throb swings the pendulum towards techno again, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29861-connan-mockasin/"">Connan Mockasin</a>'s idiosyncratic psychedelic pop draws it back into the singer-songwriter's realm. Ghost Culture, Phantasy's latest addition, falls squarely in the middle of that array. The alias belongs to the 24-year-old London studio engineer James Greenwood, and his debut album carefully fuses canny song-craft with clattering machine constructions; it offers an unusual balance between muscular grooves and whispered intimacy, as though erecting a bedsheet fort smack dab in the middle of a throbbing basement party.</p>
<p>The most immediate point of comparison might be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14157-swim/""><i>Swim</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"">Caribou</a> and the clubbier music of his alter ego <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29516-daphni/"">Daphni</a>. Greenwood is similarly fond of loping drum grooves and burbling synthesizers, and his breathy voice is faintly reminiscent of Dan Snaith's, except that Snaith tends to soar, while Greenwood's delivery is more downcast—literally, as though he were singing into his jacket lapels. (Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that he apparently recorded his vocals with a <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/huAV5eDw2D/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">microphone salvaged from a tank</a>.) But that muted tone is just what the mood of his songs calls for. In any case, he's got a way with sing-songy melodies that stick in your head; the bulk of these songs would probably work unplugged, though that's no reason to wish they were any different than they are, if only because their sound—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"">Factory Floor</a> does bubblegum pop, basically—is so unusual and delightful.</p>
<p>The opening ""Mouth"" is full of simple pleasures—the satisfying <i>oomph</i> of a well-rounded bass synth; the delicious crispness of a well-tempered machine clap—and supple nuance. The nervous spring reverb that accompanies his keyboard trills is a small detail, but it amps up the music's quiet, visceral thrill; it adds depth to the song's ample negative spaces. The principal synth riff rolls like a fistful of agates, and everything sounds as polished as a bauble in a raccoon's paws.</p>
<p>The bulk of the album offers variations on the same set of elements: the lonely warble of the Korg Mono/Poly synthesizer, snaky drum grooves, and his mopey, husky voice. In ""Arms"", detuned synth pads drizzle down like cold rain over snapping electro syncopations as he mutters cryptically about ""Moving arms, flashing teeth/ Half-closed, half-open."" ""How"" is all percolating arpeggios and lullaby repetitions; it sounds a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">the xx</a> if they made their music on broken-down Russian synthesizers and steam-powered gizmos. Many of his melodies carry a whiff of déjà vu: on ""Lying"", it's the Christmas carol ""Silent Night"", while on ""Glass"", it's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a>'s ""Your Silent Face"". There's a lot of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a> here, in fact, from his voice's faint resemblance, in places, to Bernhard Sumner's, to the chilly string pads reminiscent of the group's early albums.</p>
<p>And there are a few wildcards, too: ""Glaciers"", with its waltz tempo and wheezing organs, sounds like Phil Spector via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> (on Quaaludes), and the clammy echoes of ""Answer"" lend a hint of an Elvis-at-Sun-Studios vibe. But the album's largely uniform palette is both a strength and a weakness. By seven or eight tracks in, the sameness of the production begins to feel faintly claustrophobic. One possible way out of that cul-de-sac might have been a few more straight-up club cuts. We know that he's got them in him, because he already delivered one in the form of the Border Community homage <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkJuxTAkpaM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Red Smoke""</a>, the B-side to his debut single. And he hasn't exactly turned a blind eye to the dancefloor here, either. While his voice is foregrounded throughout, most of the album's tracks tend to break down, halfway through, into skeletal, dubbed-out fantasias. It's clear that he's arranged them with an ear for future extended mixes in which the pop songs fall away, leaving only the shuddering metallic chassis underneath. Maybe, in retrospect, it's his judicious sense of balance that holds him back: a few more extremes, and his next work might really sing.</p></div>"|20063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20063-ghost-culture/|7.1|Philip Sherburne

He moves from the outdoorsy pine of his 2011 record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15712-as-the-crow-flies/""><i>As the Crow Flies</i></a> to the more inward facing <i>From Out Here</i>, carefully trailing links to make it sound recognizably him. It’s there in the perfectly interlaced synth lines, the air of Cold War nostalgia, the overriding sense that utopian thought has become a past construct. Brooks works quietly, releasing music under varying guises, never looking for attention. It fits with his fondness for barely heralded musicians—synth pioneers who never got their dues, whose work now fuels a small part of the reissues industry. This is music that’s longing to be lost just as much as it is to be found, made with a knowledge of how the process of falling out of view can end up coloring works with a unique texture.</p>
<p>Brooks finds a broad sound palette to explore on <i>From Out Here</i>, even more so than on his other works under this name. The best tracks often have a non-musical component, such as the ticking clock that keeps rhythm on the upwardly twirling synth patterns of ""Winter Hours"", or the crackly spoken word transmission of the title track, which bears the cadence of a lost World War II-era recording. There’s even a concept driving it all, based around the arcadian English countryside being an artificial conceit generated by a computer program, making it sound like the bastard offspring of technology-run-amok thrillers like the 1977 feature <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075931/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Demon Seed</i></a>. It’s often hard to square that idea with the reality of <i>From Out Here</i>, which is all tightly controlled passages of sound, ranging from short minimal synth apparitions (""Verberatim"") to expansive tracts of folky wanderings (""Upon Oakston"").</p>
<p>Brooks’ inspirations are often musicians who could be classed as people hiding in plain sight—artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30237-suzanne-ciani/"">Suzanne Ciani</a> and Brian Bennett, who both feature on <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/cafekaput/the-advisory-circle-present-winter-from-out-here/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this mixtape</a> to accompany <i>From Out Here</i>, or the library music he and the <a href=""http://www.ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> label hold so dear. None are household names, but all have worked in the commercial sphere, either through advertising or by penning TV or film themes. The sense of build in Advisory Circle tracks such as ""Escape Lane"" and ""The Walk Home"" would fit perfectly in that sphere, scrolling over B-movie end credits or zipping across a sepia tinted vacuum cleaner commercial. Somehow, this music, and arguably the entire Ghost Box aesthetic, makes those worlds seem closer than many people may have realized. It’s also what prevents these darker Advisory Circle tracks from encroaching too close to the gloom—there’s always a key sense of play at work.</p>
<p>The most satisfying part of <i>From Out Here</i> is how much wider Brooks casts his net than before. Sure, there are hints of small releases, such as that mysterious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15696-science-of-the-sea/"">Jürgen Müller</a> record from a few years back on the beautiful ""Jessica Finds the Beach"". But it’s not hard to see the spectre of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a>’s power station fear surface on ""The Blue Energy Programme"", and it’s easy to trace a path from the sparse passages of ""Experiment!"" to the melancholy side of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a>’s <i>Playing With Fire</i>. At those moments the Advisory Circle vibrates with possibility, drawing in endless strands of music’s past, with Brooks steadying the tiller to make sure everything maintains the correct trajectory. For a notionally darker work this album ends up being more enjoyable than some of his prior records, mainly because the sense of exploration is heightened with each turn taken. Brooks and Ghost Box are often talked about in narrow planes of sound, but here the future feels persuasively wide open.</p></div>"|20081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20081-from-out-here/|7.0|Nick Neyland

Frequent Coen Brothers collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16802-t-bone-burnett/"">T Bone Burnett</a> organized the concert as a loose celebration of the music featured in the film, a bleak comedy of haplessness that follows a frustrated folk singer in 1960 as he plies his trade around Manhattan. Featuring older legends alongside some of the younger musicians they inspired, the event was filmed and released first as a documentary and now as a soundtrack, both titled <i>Another Day Another Time: Celebrating the Music of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"".</i></p>
<p>In some ways it’s not too far removed from the folk and blues showcases curated by archivists and producers like John Hammond and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12816-alan-lomax/"">Alan Lomax</a> in the 1940s, who brought then-obscure folk acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13411-leadbelly/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Leadbelly</a> and Dock Boggs to venues like Carnegie Hall. But the real precursor for <i>Another Day Another Time</i> is obviously <i>Down from the Mountain,</i> which in 2000 extended the success of <i>O Brother Where Art Thou? </i>from screen to stage. That movie played its rural milieu for cheap laughs, but the soundtrack played it straight and sold millions, won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 2002, and inspired today’s highly dubious folk boomlet. Of course it would be nearly impossible for <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i> to match the fluke success of <i>O Brother</i>, especially the fluke part, so the concert is premature at best and self-congratulatory at worst. There’s something suspicious in this cart-before-the-horse endeavor, which plays less like a celebratory concert and more like an elaborate promotional push.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, we know all the beats of the movie, but how would concertgoers have responded to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Elvis Costello</a>, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac so faithfully re-creating ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" with no knowledge of its use in the film? Did they even know who Isaac was when he took the stage to perform ""Hang Me, O Hang Me""? His performance was crucial to the movie, projecting more melancholy than the Coen Brothers could muster themselves, but the gravity he brings to the stage can be unwieldy: Singing ""Green Rocky Road"", he makes the line, ""Hooka tooka soda cracker, does your mama smoke tobacco?"" sound like a suicide note.</p>
<p>While Burnett has spent the 13 years between <i>Down from the Mountain </i>and <i>Another Day Another Time</i> becoming the most ubiquitous man in Americana as well as the most boring, he at least assembles a diverse line-up for the show. There are some of his expected cohorts, including Costello, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Marcus Mumford</a>, and Rhiannon Giddens, all of whom appear on Burnett’s New Basement Tapes project in 2014. Giddens bulldozes her two songs, showing little of the interpretive nuance that distinguished the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23453-carolina-chocolate-drops/"">Carolina Chocolate Drops</a>, and Mumford pretty much just shows up. But there’s also the Milk Carton Kids evoking the collegiate folk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5702-simon-garfunkel/"">Simon &amp; Garfunkel</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2943-colin-meloy/"">Colin Meloy</a> lowering the stakes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9252-jackson-c-frank/"">Jackson C. Frank</a>’s ""Blues Run the Game"", and the Punch Brothers harmonizing on ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" (wait, isn’t that <i>Big Lebowski?</i>). Lake Street Dive conjure some much-needed lasciviousness on the R&amp;B-stoked ""You Go Down Smooth"", showing how folk can meld so naturally with other genres, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">Jack White</a>, huffing helium while gargling gravel, offers a respite from the event’s staid pace with rambunctious renditions of ""Did You Hear John Hurt?"" and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">Stripes</a>’ own ""We’re Going to Be Friends"".</p>
<p>Still<i>, Another Day Another Time</i> doesn’t have much more to say about the genre and its lasting influence than ""Yay, folk!"" The lack of any sort of critical thesis or undergirding may seem merely academic, but it translates into performances that are wanly reverent and unanimated, celebrating the music mainly for its age but not its actual history. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the concert is how apolitical it is. Throughout most of the 20th century, folk was a highly radicalized form, largely because it heralded a populist political stance. Simply playing this music and teaching it to others was enough for the House Un-American Activities Committee to brand <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26811-pete-seeger/"">Pete Seeger</a> a commie. ""This Land Is Your Land"" may be our unofficial national anthem, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14407-woody-guthrie/"">Woody Guthrie</a> intended it as a protest song. It’s actually refreshing to hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4572-gillian-welch/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Gillian Welch</a> and Dave Rawlings sing the unpopular verse lamenting the very idea of private property, but how much were those concert tickets again?</p>
<p>Folk songs aren’t private property. Especially in 2015, when racial violence is depressingly common and the disparity between the haves and have-nots unfathomably wide, this music ought to be more relevant than ever. But there’s no sense of danger or dissent in any performance on <i>Another Day Another Time</i>, and therefore there is no sense of courage or outrage to illuminate the songs. The fatal flaw in this concert is that these artists are only celebrating folk music when they should be practicing it.</p></div>"|20111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20111-celebrating-the-music-of-inside-llewyn-davis/|4.1|Stephen M.

Not just that of the family members you must provide for and protect, but your own, as well. Plain and simple, the first rule of parenting is: don’t die. When entrusted with the immense obligation of caring for a child, even the youngest of new parents become exceedingly conscious of their own mortality and survival instincts. Behaviors once taken for granted—like, say, air travel or cycling alongside cars on city streets—start to feel more like roulette games wagered with your life; once-considered activities like bungee jumping and skydiving get transferred from your bucket list to a ""</span><i>fuck that</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">"" list. </span></p>
<p>You could hear that sort of uneasiness gradually seep into the seemingly serene work of Noah Lennox—a.k.a. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a>—over the past decade, both without and within <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>. As the first A.C. member to become a parent, Lennox has become increasingly fond of rooting his boundless sonic exploration in meditations on home life, whether cheekily celebrating the drudgery of domesticity (""Chores""), eulogizing the family dog (""Derek""), making heartfelt affirmations of paternal duty (""My Girls""), or openly fretting over his shortcomings as a breadwinner (“Alsatian Darn”). And though he’s avoided explicitly ecclesiastical language in his solo work since writing 2004’s psych-folk hymnal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6141-young-prayer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Young Prayer</i></a> for his late father, each Panda Bear record released since has retained the form and feel of a communal church service: They welcome us in with reassuring proverbs (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT3NVv7IZ8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""try to remember always, always to have a good time""</a>) couched in heaven-sent harmonies, provide a sense comfort in the face of encroaching chaos, and strive to connect our physical world to a more celestial plane. And be it the psychedelic pop sprawl of 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10025-person-pitch/"" target=""_blank""><i>Person Pitch</i></a> or the dub-like lurch of 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15299-tomboy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tomboy</i></a>, a Panda Bear record ultimately requires a test of faith, a belief that Lennox’s beaming voice will guide us safely through the dense, phantasmagoric fog that threatens to consume it. In Lennox’s cathedral of sound, you can always see the stormy skies creeping in view through the radiant stained-glass windows.</p>
<p>On his latest venture, the tension between inner peace and external pressure reaches boss-battle proportions. Lifting its main-event billing from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Tubby_Meets_Rockers_Uptown"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">old King Tubby records</a>, <i>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper </i>serves a similar function for its creator as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19200-avey-tares-slasher-flicks-enter-the-slasher-house/"">Slasher Flicks did for Avey Tare</a>—it’s a playful, fantastical response to some serious life changes. In Portner’s case, it was divorce and strep throat; for Lennox, it’s the entry into middle age and the substantial familial responsibilities that go with it. In <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/panda-bear-chases-the-psychedelic-sweet-spot-on-grim-reaper-lp-20141212"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview</a>, Lennox pondered the possibility of retiring the Panda Bear moniker, which makes sense—part of getting older is doing away with your old college nicknames. But if that is indeed the case, Panda Bear is not going down without a fight.</p>
<p>More streamlined than <i>Person Pitch</i> and more rhythmically robust than <i>Tomboy</i>, <i>Grim Reaper</i> is Panda Bear’s toughest, grimiest, and funkiest album to date. But all that extra grit and groove doesn’t come at the expense Lennox’s unmistakable melodic graces, which still provide each song with its pulse. As to be expected from an album co-produced with <i>Tomboy</i> holdover Pete Kember (a.k.a. Sonic Boom of '80s psych-punk patriarchs the<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank""> Spacemen 3</a>) and reportedly inspired by classic '90s boom-bap beat construction, <i>Grim Reaper</i> achieves just the right balance of skull-splitting drone and head-noddin’ drive. In contrast to the unpredictably amorphous song structures that defined previous Panda Bear records, many of the songs on <i>Grim Reaper</i> lock into a looped beat and rarely waver course. However, they’re often prefaced by or dissolve into ominous, buzzing oscillations (some of which, like the half-minute ""Davy Jones' Locker"", are portioned off into stand-alone tracks) that suggest the onset of a panic attack or some shadowy predator. As such, the midnight-marauding march of lead single ""Mr Noah"" and electro-fuzzed yodeling of ""Boys Latin"" are transformed into weapons of retaliation—a strobe-lit assault on the encroaching bleakness. ""Dark cloud has descended again,"" Lennox sings on the chorus of the latter song, but his elated vocal thrusts the black mass back up into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Lennox <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9529-panda-bear/"">told Pitchfork last fall</a> that, despite all the personal rumination that inspired <i>Grim Reaper</i>, he wanted to keep his lyrics purposefully non-specific and relatable. But for all its booming breaks and future-shocked freneticism, <i>Grim Reaper</i>—like all Panda Bear records—remains a highly insular experience, one where it often sounds as if Lennox is speaking into a mirror. ""So good, you’ve got it so good,"" he sings overtop the blissed-out shuffle of ""Crosswords""—a simple statement of fact from a happily married father of two who lives in a cosmopolitan coastal European city in between sold-out tours. But his wistful delivery betrays the fear of losing it all. And Lennox spends much of the seven-minute ""Come to Your Senses"" repeating a question (""Are you mad?"") for which there is only one logical answer (""Yeah, I’m mad""), as the song’s shantytown acid-house throb mediates between serenity and insanity. A sobering aftershock arrives in the form of late-album wake-up call ""Selfish Gene""—a sort-of post-rave <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CurONBAJnk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That's Not Me""</a>—where the incessant synth-jabs provide Lennox with needling reminders of his family-man mission (""When it comes to fill those spaces/ Only you can fill those spaces"").</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, <i>Grim Reaper</i> feels like a gradual process of Lennox trying to tune out the extraneous noise of modern life and focus on what’s truly important to him. And it’s an evolution mirrored by the album’s sequence, which bookends the most boisterous, beat-driven songs around two stunning centerpiece tracks—""Tropic of Cancer"" and ""Lonely Wanderer""—that provide <i>Grim Reaper</i> with an extended and well-earned moment of quiet contemplation. The former is a cosmic doo-wop serenade that stands as the most affecting and beautiful vocal performance of Lennox’s career; the latter projects a gorgeous, aqueous tranquility unheard from the Animal Collective camp since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tORfE3MDqWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">side two of <i>Feels</i></a>, its light piano drizzle summoning thundercloud rumbles of foreboding reverberations.</p>
<p>But even when it trades in day-glo stompers for weightless ballads, <i>Grim Reaper</i> still crushes. In the unsentimental, funereal refrain of ""Tropic of Cancer""—""you can’t get back, you won’t come back, you can’t come back to it""—Lennox invokes his father’s 2002 death and, in doing so, reemphasizes his own current reality as a patriarch, and that pervasive, deep-seated fear of prematurely leaving one’s family behind. If <i>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper</i> posits adult life as some imaginary horror movie, it’s one where the phone call warning of impending doom is coming from inside the house. </p></div>"|20079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20079-panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper/|8.7|Stuart Berman

Paul Thomas Anderson's 2014 film <i>Inherent Vice</i>, meanwhile, gives composer and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a> guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1819-jonny-greenwood/"">Jonny Greenwood</a> a chance to indulge his inner Hollywood romantic. As a composer, Greenwood has mostly been called on for slashing chords, thick string textures, and foreboding. But ""Shasta"", which opens the <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nonesuch</a> OST and appears early in the film, opens on a rosy blush of strings and woodwinds that calls to mind sinuous old Hollywood scores. It is by far the most conventional orchestral music to emerge from his pen.</p>
<p>The soundtrack, sequenced out of order from the film and featuring a few spots of dialogue, read by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"">Joanna Newsom</a>, is a series of blindsides, which takes the conventions of the Raymond Chandler detective story down a series of batshit rococo detours. The film aims, as did Pynchon's book, to blur the question ""Whodunit?"" until it looks more like a dazed ""Whuh?"" The soundtrack, which crab hops from psych-rock to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14504-minnie-ripperton/"">Minnie Riperton</a> to Disney orchestral interludes, faithfully recreates this sensation of dislocation and head-scratching befuddlement. No matter where Doc Sportello was in <i>Inherent Vice</i>'s sun-baked, taupe-and-polyester landscape, it was the wrong place, and the selections are a series of similar awkward encounters.</p>
<p>The second selection, after Greenwood's plush opening, is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>'s ""Vitamin C"", a gonzo piece of insect-throated avant-rock that hits you in the face like a scalding cup of gas station coffee. It shares time with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>'s idyllic ""Journey Through the Past"" and the medicated lounge lizard cheer of Kyu Sakamoto's ""Sukiyaki"", all of which finds itself jostled up against bits of Greenwood's score, which tries on some truly weird duds: The misty strings and woodwinds on ""Meeting Crocker Fenway"" don't feel far from John Williams' <i>Harry Potter</i> scores. The vaguely <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Morricone</a>-esque ""The Golden Fang"" features mallet percussion and guitar arpeggios that shimmer like exhaust off a motel parking lot.</p>
<p>If this soundtrack were a room full of furniture, in other words, you would shield your eyes from the clash. But it might actually make for a sleeker and more condensed vehicle for the film's stoned, clammy energy than the film itself, which sank into a narrative tar pit in its last hour and tested the patience of even PTA's most steadfast devotees. It's exciting to hear Greenwood stretch into new styles, and ""Adrian Prussia"" is incredible, a crunching meeting point between digital static and strident violins. Like the movie, the soundtrack is a pungent, incoherent, occasionally haunting trifle. The feeling is of a bunch of intelligent and talented people trying on a bunch of funny-colored clothing and giggling at each other. If you're not wearing the costumes, there's a limit to just how entertained by all of it you can be.</p></div>"|20042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20042-inherent-vice-ost/|7.3|Jayson Greene

The evidence is all there on Chief Keef’s <a href=""http://instagram.com/chieffkeeffsossa"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> which, in recent months, has been filled with dozens of commissioned and original works of art. They’re mostly portraits of himself and his friends, in varying degrees of trippiness. Often, they’re depicted (by what seems to be Glo Gang’s in-house artist, a silver-bearded Angeleno called <a href=""http://instagram.com/billdabutcher/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Da Butcher</a>) as members of a cheery cartoon solar system; Blood Money, Keef’s cousin and the Gang’s eldest member, who was shot and killed in Chicago last spring, is memorialized as a tattooed moon with angel wings. There’s a collage of Keef as a Viking skeleton holding America in a cage (he calls it <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/v9v8cFyQa6/?modal=true"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Americun Shakedown""</a>); a <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/wEHp2UyQUE/?modal=true"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sketch</a> of a dread-headed Mount Rushmore; a <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/vdtOJfSQTQ/?all_comments_on_ad=undefined"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">triptych</a> depicting a G-rated Keef engaging in water sports. Last month, Keef helped curate a <a href=""http://www.frank151.com/news/recap-chapter-58-franksosa-release-event-at-seventh-letter-g.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gallery show</a> in collaboration with media company FRANK151, to which he also contributed original artwork. He’s turned his Los Angeles home into his own private museum, obsessing over the minutia of presentation (<a href=""http://instagram.com/p/xdvMsnSQYm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Trying to see if I should keep what’s up up?""</a>)—this from the guy whose preferred mode of self-expression, not so long ago, was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIZxb13WOhs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Emojis""</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Then again, Keef’s thorough immersion in his own universe of aesthetics echoes his musical agenda since the release of his divisive major label debut two years ago. Since then, the Chicago ex-pat has refused to be understood on any terms other than his own, rejecting anything remotely resembling his 2012 crossover hits in favor of abstraction and obscurity. He drowned the crowd-pleasing hooks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17477-finally-rich/"" target=""_blank""><i>Finally Rich</i></a> in Auto-Tune and promethazine (he’s blamed critically panned 2013 mixtapes <i>Bang 2</i> and <i>Almighty So</i> on the latter) and probed the outer limits of vocal performance. Yips, skrrrrts, and gurgles took the place of coherent language. He became obsessed with making beats, an entirely non-verbal mode of expression; on October's brooding, distorted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20027-chief-keef-gucci-mane-back-from-the-dead-2big-gucci-sosa/"" target=""_blank""><i>Back From the Dead 2</i></a> tape, released a week after the announcement that Keef was dropped from Interscope, he produced 16 of its 20 tracks. <i>Nobody</i>, his long-awaited sophomore album, released suddenly and without much fanfare, is similarly experimental, and equally devoid of any conventional hits. But where Keef’s spent the last two years attempting to hide in plain sight, stubbornly obfuscating his own thoughts to compensate for his discomfort in the spotlight, <i>Nobody</i> is, at its best, strikingly lucid. Maybe his recent passion for visual art has rekindled an interest in direct expression. Maybe he’s just growing up.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Finally Rich</i>, as an album title, was aspirational as much as it was declarative, harnessing the laws of attraction to will fortune into existence. <i>Nobody</i> is a similar statement of purpose, but this time, the goal is to disappear. It’s not hard to understand Keef’s preoccupation with obscurity. Thrust into the public eye in 2012, he became a stand-in for Chicago’s ills more than an artist in his own right. His music had always been characterized by themes of loyalty and betrayal (trust only your inner circle—the rest are dangerous); hysterical media attention only reinforced that. If you’re going to be misunderstood anyway, why not ensure it? Equal parts knee-jerk trolling (he’s still a teenager) and defense mechanism, he hurtled towards oblivion, in what looked a lot like a downward spiral.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Nobody</i>, much like <i>BFTD2</i>, is a dispatch from this void. But <i>BFTD2</i> functioned as a submersion into his new aesthetic, more concerned with style than meaning; it narrowed in on weird grooves, unorthodox rhyme patterns, mood over everything. Almost in spite of its mission statement, <i>Nobody</i> is sharper, clearer, and more purposeful. It’s a neat 12 tracks, some of them less than two minutes long, executive produced by Glo Gang’s 12 Million. A handful feel more like sketches than completed works. But its high points have a clarity unmatched within Keef’s last two years of work; at times, he’s straight up vulnerable. He may not be coming back to earth any time soon, but he’s looking his audience in the eyes.</p>
<p>Keef’s lyricism has gotten slyer. His wit seems sharper; sometimes he cracks subtle jokes at his own expense. On ""Pit Stop"", an album cut on par with any of <i>Finally Rich</i>’s, he quips, ""Watch out, I’m 18 and I’m driving fast!"" In the context of his public traffic arrests (in 2013, pulled over for driving 110 in a 55, he told police, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVQ85DkafUI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Well, it’s a fast car, that’s why I bought it""</a>), it’s the equivalent of Taylor Swift winkingly acknowledging her reputation as a crazy girlfriend on ""Blank Space"". ""Twelve Bars""—a hypnotic burst of chimes that, like much of <i>Nobody</i>, is a closer descendent of cloudy cult favorite ""Citgo"" than anything else on <i>Finally Rich</i>—is a play on the drill canon as much as it is an exercise in wordplay. It nods to the drill canon, only to subvert it with novelty bars like, ""Driving 12 cars at one time!""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But on ""Hard"", one of the album’s two emotional cornerstones, Keef goes beyond crafty in-jokes and bares his soul. Over a beat somewhere between 40’s sulky symphonics circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18511-drake-nothing-was-the-same/"" target=""_blank""><i>Nothing Was the Same</i></a> and the wispy New Age chirps of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>’s <i>Rain in England</i>, Keef delivers two of his most vulnerable verses to date (along with some pretty impressive bar-for-bar lyricism). ""She don’t accept me, but she speak to my watch/ She won’t look at me, but she see I go hard,"" he sings, honing in on the romantic insecurities that have emerged in Keef’s work for years now, from 2012’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8ci2qi-Iys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Save That Shit""</a> to 2014’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWOPi6D-fqQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No""</a>. He shrugs at his success, recognizing it as more of a burden than a blessing—everything’s pointless anyway. ""Money ain’t that much, I’ll give it up... Life ain’t that much, I’ll live it up."" He’s at once proud of his ability to support his people and wary of being used: ""Everybody eat, I’ll bill it up/ Baby I’ll keep my mouth closed, I’ll seal it up."" Even its title references the unflinching ubermasculinity that characterizes drill and its proponents, and beyond that, the temperament expected of black men from a young age. In early interviews, Keef claimed to be <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWUg1fgYPiE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">16 going on 300</a>; he’d long since been a man, but in many ways remained immature. These days, he’s just a world-weary 19.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s <i>Nobody</i>’s title track, though, that gives the sharpest insights as to where Keef’s at these days. Initially teased on <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/rx88nEyQdL/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> last summer, with its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> feature and threadbare Willie Hutch sample, ""Nobody"" hinted at a return to the old, coherent Keef. Instead, it’s as sonically inscrutable as ever. The snares are decidedly off. Kanye’s contributions don’t go too far beyond that 15-second clip. Listeners wondered if there’d been some mistake, if the track was unfinished, if Kanye had signed off on this at all. It doesn’t matter: ""Nobody"" isn’t about Kanye, it’s about Keef at his rawest and most honest. ""They thought I was a joke,"" he burbles with a melancholy that suggests he reads the comments. It’s Keef’s most clear-eyed dispatch yet from the void into which he’s hurtled himself. ""I can’t fear nobody… I can’t hear nobody… I can’t see nobody,"" he mewls, almost giddy with loneliness as he watches his surroundings fade to black, romancing the abyss. Things aren’t perfect, but they’re better than the alternative. It was awfully dreary, anyway—being Somebody.</p></div>"|20087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20087-nobody/|7.0|Meaghan Garvey

While electronic producers—everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a>, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31081-sophie/"">Sophie</a>, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32140-bok-bok/"">Bok Bok</a>—have been tapped with increasing frequency for pop, rap, and R&amp;B duties, they have opted almost exclusively for the nebulous, the veiled, and the dramatic. Hinton's music, via its samples and tempos, brushes against rap, grime, and dance but in a comparatively tranquil manner.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hinton finds a partner in Niia, an upwardly mobile chanteuse in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a> mold: modern sensibility, classical execution. Before her <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/niia/sets/ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Generation Blue</i></a> EP hit late last year, her <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/982496-Niia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sole credit</a> was an appearance on a 2007 Wyclef Jean track. <i>Generation Blue</i> vacillated between the type of pleasant indie disco you might pair with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"">Solange</a> (""Body"") and classicist soul ballads whose lack of imagination baffled. <i>Breaking</i> is a five-track EP featuring three re-workings of <i>Generation Blue</i> tracks and two new songs. <span>Effusive and bright, but patient, the result of this coupling is a little odd</span>, like someone set out to squeegee trip-hop's windows. Hinton and Niia are functionally playing the same game as artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"">Kelela</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>, but they're more tentative, befitting two artists still feeling out a partnership.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hinton does well here, especially considering these songs were written and produced without him. The electro bassline that he stitches to ""Body"" is the kind of melodic charmer you take to meet mom. The track, which features Niia's most distinct vocal, is a clear improvement on the original, strong enough to anchor this minor, exploratory release. One minute into the second track, ""Breaking"", he deploys one of those strident, staccato piano bursts that buoyed <i>Nonfiction</i>. This trick, which he again employs on closer ""David's House"", is like hearing the track's heartbeat accelerate, an instant indication that things are ramping up. This is undeniably attractive music: Niia a pristine presence, Hinton seemingly incapable of producing music that doesn't twinkle while flinging itself forward.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, this is a threadbare release, and the partnership falters. On ""Last Man"" Niia probes an old playground taunt (""Even if you were the last man on earth/ I wouldn't try to love you"") for emotional depth and, predictably, finds little; hearing her repeat the phrase over blisters of sulking bass is faintly absurd. It's difficult to blame Hinton, though, as Niia needs the help: she's an indistinct presence, leaning on tropes and a needlessly breathy delivery. Even the chorus of ""Body"", the finest track here, feels like an exercise in R&amp;B madlibs: ""We can be <i><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">strangers</span></i>/ We can be <i><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">strangers</span></i> in the night/ We can be <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><i>lovers</i></span>/ As long as you <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><i>love</i></span> my body <i><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">right</span></i>.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Niia x The Range</i> is a bit of a lark, both artists stepping outside their comfort zones, but only just so. The EP functions as a bit of a proof of concept for Hinton, as he proves himself capable of sliding in underneath a vocalist while retaining his sound's character, while Niia's contributions feel slighter. Let's call this practice, for both of them.</p></div>"|20039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20039-breaking-ep/|6.2|Andrew Gaerig

Sitting next to his </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/""><span>Deerhoof </span></a><span>bandmates instead of behind them, Saunier ripples his arms and legs like noodles, and tosses his head so recklessly it threatens to fly off. Chippendale’s head is often wrapped in a ghoulish homemade</span><a href=""http://youtu.be/YxSi4a0Ygk8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span> mask</span></a><span>, and his rapid-fire drumming in </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/""><span>Lightning Bolt</span></a><span> has a brutish quality to match. Neither is all about flash; both use simple kits and have built their idiosyncratic styles from basic, punk-derived roots. But for two decades with their respective groups, Chippendale and Saunier have consistently been a sight to behold.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That’s why the smartest part of their first duo record—besides the idea to have them play together to begin with—is that it’s an audio-visual package. Along with two 19-minute sides of crackling sonics, </span><span><i>Brian Chippendale &amp; Greg Saunier</i> </span><span>includes beautifully-shot video of the entire session, as well as a </span><a href=""http://youtu.be/bxfTb3h0-K0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>mini-documentary</span></a><span> about the pair with testimonials from the likes of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/""><span>Jon Dwyer</span></a><span>, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6284-wayne-coyne/""><span>Wayne Coyne</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17456-kid-millions/""><span>Kid Millions</span></a><span>. The music on its own is compelling, but watching Chippendale and Saunier converse and connect shines a clearer, more hypnotic light on their collective wizardry. Their meeting is cerebral and expressive, but it’s also physical and violent— imagine </span><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082783/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>My Dinner With Andre</i></a><span> as a boxing match. As Chippendale says in the mini-doc, ""Playing drums is a workout that has a byproduct of making sound.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The visceral thrust of </span><i>Brian Chippendale &amp; Greg Saunier </i><span>comes across equally in the video and audio-only versions, but with fascinatingly divergent effects. I guessed beforehand that watching the pair play would make the music feel more structured and tangible—since the motion would add cause-and-effect—while the sound alone would seem random. But the opposite proved true. On video, the speed of their playing is dizzying, and the doubled hyper-impulsivity makes everything too dense to fully process, creating an intoxicating waterfall of sight and sound. By contrast, without the visual information to keep track of, listening to the music allows your brain to organize the white-hot playing into discernible sections, some of which approach straight-up rock beats.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Rock naturally informs the pair’s work throughout, and the format, full-on improvisation, gives the session a jazz aura too. But something about their mesh puts this record in its own category, on the edges of both of those immeasurably-wide genres. Perhaps it’s how the always-lurking threat of a beat overlaps with the never-ending consciousness stream. Everytime you sense a 4/4 snap developing, machine-gun kicks and pin-prick slaps wedge inside and bust it apart. Throughout the maelstrom, Chippendale and Saunier maintain their respective percussion personalities—the former’s rapid-fire pointillism and the latter’s rolling rumble—without stepping on each other or canceling out. What could easily become indistinct mush instead is continually precise, each sound hopping around the other like a juggler’s knives.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-af640253-bd81-b06c-e73b-d1d53ad52d92""><span>In fact, if there’s a shortcoming to </span><i>Brian Chippendale &amp; Greg Saunier</i><span>, it’s that the two players merge their distinct languages without quite creating a third. That’s to be expected; it’s their first musical meeting, and they have to get to know each other on the fly. In a sense, this makes for a more entertaining record, like the fantasy version of what these two might sound like together. In other words, it doesn’t disappoint. But there’s also a sense that Chippendale and Saunier are inches away from a monstrous two-headed hybrid, one that will not just meet expectations, but demolish them.</span></span></p></div>"|20047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20047-brian-chippendale-greg-saunier/|7.5|Marc Masters

It was not, as many have suggested, 14 years of silence. The last D'Angelo album, 2000’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/""><i>Voodoo</i></a>, was a near perfect communion of buttery soul, Crisco-fried funk, and hip-hop thump, but the <a href=""http://www.vevo.com/watch/dangelo/Untitled-(How-Does-It-Feel)/USVI30500120"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for its calling card ,""Untitled (How Does It Feel?)"", a lingering, sensual glance over the singer’s face and chest, turned him into an unwitting sex symbol. Live shows soon descended into catcalling, and D, convinced his music had become an accessory to his looks, slipped slowly out of sight. Dispatches grew scarce and worrisome. There were arrests. There was a car accident. For a while, D'Angelo appeared to follow talented but troubled forbears <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6280-sly-stone/"">Sly Stone</a> into the dark.</p>
<p>Even in darkness there was still music. D'Angelo guested on albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"">Q-Tip</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4102-snoop-dogg/"">Snoop Dogg</a>, and more. He taught himself to play guitar. There were perennial promises of a new album. D'Angelo returned to the stage in 2012 peppering sets of old favorites with carefully chosen covers and unreleased new material. <i>Black Messiah</i> isn’t a sneak attack; it’s a slow-simmering gumbo finally boiled over. We tasted its fearless ambivalence to genre boundaries in 2007 when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"">Roots</a> maestro Questlove snuck an early version of the stately Joe Pass homage of ""Really Love"" to Australia’s Triple J Radio, in 2010 when the punk-hop scorcher ""1000 Deaths"" briefly slipped onto YouTube and in 2012 when D'Angelo returned to television to unveil the big band funk smartbomb ""Sugah Daddy"" on the BET Awards. Still, it’s a wonder to hear his mutant groove unblemished by the passage of time and stretched around this gobstopping cosmic slop of country funk, psych and new wave.</p>
<p><i>Black Messiah</i> is a study in controlled chaos. The nightmarish chorus of ""1000 Deaths"" arrives late and fierce, as though the band unfurled its crunchy, lumbering vamp just long enough to violently snatch it out from under us. ""The Charade""'s Minneapolis sound funk rock follows, every bit as bright as the previous track was menacing until you zero in on the threadbare heart-sickness of D and P-Funk affiliate Kendra Foster’s lyrics. <i>Black Messiah</i> pulls together disparate threads few predecessors have had the smarts or audacity to unite. One song might channel <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1505-funkadelic/"">Funkadelic</a>, another, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25171-prince-the-revolution/"">Revolution</a>, but the shiftless mad doctor experimentation and the mannered messiness at the root of it all is unmistakably the Vanguard. <i>Black Messiah</i> is a dictionary of soul, but D'Angelo is the rare classicist able to filter the attributes of the greats in the canon into a sound distinctly his own. It’s at once familiar and oddly unprecedented, a peculiar trick to pull on an album recorded over the span of a decade.</p>
<p>The timeliness of <i>Black Messiah</i>’s message is doubly astounding. The album was pieced together over painstaking years and originally pegged for launch next year, but D, affected by national unrest around unprosecuted police officer involved shootings in Ferguson, MO and New York City, nudged the release date up to speak to the times. <i>Black Messiah</i> plays out most like Sly Stone’s <i>There’s a Riot Goin’ On</i> in its penetrating sense of disorder. Where <i>Voodoo</i> concerned itself chiefly with the ups and downs of cohabitation, the new music steps outside to see what’s going on, and it ain’t good news. ""1000 Deaths"" folds the old adage about cowards and soldiers into a word about guns, fear and desperation. ""The Charade"" calls bullshit on a knotty history of systemic racism. (""All we wanted was a chance to talk/ ‘Stead we've only got outlined in chalk."") ""Prayer"" looks for strength from on high, opening on a choppy Lord’s Prayer whose signal keeps cutting out.</p>
<p>Alongside this wartime pith even the sunnier songs come across darkly. The bipartite nostalgia romp ""Back to the Future"" looks for solace in memories ostensibly because the present is discouraging. The love songs run a little morbid. The titular pledge of ""Betray My Heart"" doesn’t speak fealty so much as candor, and the album’s barn burner of a closer ""Another Life"" is a song of devotion in the vein of the Stylistics’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR4Gg4Gf_3A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Are Everything""</a>—except that the couple never really meets. <i>Black Messiah</i> is about finding something to hang onto in dire times, soldiering through the infuriating insanity of oppression with a support system in tow. ""It’s about people rising up in Ferguson and in Egypt and in Occupy Wall Street and in every place where a community has had enough and decides to make change happen,"" D'Angelo writes in the liner notes. ""<i>Black Messiah</i> is not one man. It’s a feeling that, collectively, we are all that leader."" He may have taken well over a decade to show face again, but it turns out D'Angelo is right on time.</p></div>"|20078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20078-black-messiah/|9.4|Craig Jenkins

It’s 2010, six weeks before the release of her debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14898-pink-friday/""><i>Pink Friday</i></a>. She’s working on the album’s finishing touches, though it’s just gone up for presale on Amazon, and people are blowing up her phone, asking for favors. She’s pissed, but she composes herself for the camera crew—they’re in the studio shooting footage for a documentary MTV will premiere a few years later, called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRPHRQyS19M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""My Time Now""</a>—to explain. She’s wearing a goofy, cotton-candy beehive wig, but her tone is serious. ""When you’re a girl, you have to be, like, everything. You have to be dope at what you do, but you have to be super sweet, and you have to be sexy, and you have to be this, and you have to be that, and you have to be nice—it’s like, I can’t be all those things at once!"" She pauses for a single dramatic blink, and for a moment, she goes somewhere else: <a href=""http://youtu.be/PzGZamtlRP0?t=2m21s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I’m a human beiiiinnnnngggggg!""</a> She draws the word out for three full seconds, the same way she would a year later in her song-stealing verse on Big Sean’s ""Dance (A$$)"" (""In the islands of Waikikiiiiiiiiii…""). It’s sort of a joke—her inflection is completely alien, or like a robot malfunctioning—but nobody laughs, and she quickly apologizes for ranting and goes back to fixing her eyeliner.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Until this year, that side of Nicki didn’t get out much, at least on record. Over the course of three official mixtapes, two studio albums (plus one Re-Up), and countless features, we’ve been acquainted with Nicki Lewinsky, Roman Zolanski, the Female Weezy, the Harajuku Barbie, and most of all, with Nicki Minaj LLC (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW9rITLjKz8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I’m a brand, bitch! I’m a brand!""</a>). But we know surprisingly little about Onika Maraj, the 11th-highest paid rapper in America according to this year’s Forbes list, whose first and second platinum-selling albums were critically panned for appealing more to teenage girls than middle-aged guardians of Hip-Hop Culture. Onstage at 2012’s Summer Jam, Hot 97’s Peter Rosenberg openly trashed Minaj, the headlining act: ""I know there’s some chicks here waiting to sing 'Starships' later: I’m not talking to y’all right now, fuck that bullshit. I’m here to talk about real hip-hop shit."" Minaj dipped out; today, ""Nicki Minaj controversy"" is one of four sub-categories of the ""Career"" section of Rosenberg’s Wikipedia page.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Minaj entered 2014 with an agenda. She toned down the technicolor costumes and wigs, making headlines when she debuted her natural hair at the premiere for <i>The Other Woman</i>, her first film role. She spent the winter unleashing a string of remixes hard enough to re-invigorate the ""Best Rapper Alive"" claims sparked years ago by her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11970-monster-ft-justin-vernon-rick-ross-jay-z-and-nicki-minaj/"">""Monster""</a> verse and subsequently abandoned by rap fans whose delicate sensibilities were no match for glossy RedOne beats and Bud Light plugs. She railed against ""non-mogul ass niggas"" on the snarling misandry anthem <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mwNbTL3pOs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lookin Ass""</a>, toting twin machine guns in the video; she recruited Lil Herb, Chicago drill’s rookie of the year, for gritty loosie <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/nickiminaj/chi-raq-by-nicki-minaj-ft-lil"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chi-Raq""</a>, where she promised to ""smack bitches, no Smack Cam, closed fists, no backhands."" Longtime fans, and those freshly back on the bandwagon, postulated that third album <i>The Pinkprint</i> would be a return to ""Mixtape Nicki,"" the one from Southside Jamaica, Queens, who had more substantial concerns than pink wigs and global entrepreneurship.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course, then came ""Pills N Potions"", a simpering Dr. Luke piano ballad, and ""Anaconda"", by Minaj’s own admission a novelty song and perhaps her most explicitly girl-oriented single to date. There was that confusing anecdote tucked into her BET Awards acceptance speech that almost felt like a cry for help: ""The other day, literally I didn’t tell anyone this, I really thought I was about to die. Like I was saying my prayers to die. And I didn’t even wanna call the ambulance because I thought, well if I call the ambulance, it’s gonna be on TMZ."" Months later, TMZ <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2014/11/04/nicki-minaj-attacks-boyfriend-car-baseball-bat/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">alleged</a> that Minaj had smashed the windows of maybe-fiancé Safaree Samuels’ Benz; their exceedingly private 14-year relationship seemed to be over. Whether her jarring 2014 trajectory was an elaborate scheme to dangle a ""real hip-hop"" carrot in front of naysayers only to yank it away, or a plan gone awry as her personal life imploded, <i>The Pinkprint</i> defies expectations from both poles of her fanbase. It’s not a return to Mixtape Nicki, or a third round of Nicki The Brand’s world-conquering dance-pop. It’s an album by <span>Onika Maraj</span>. And it’s a serious album, in the sense that it asks to be taken seriously. If that seems audacious, consider that most rappers don’t have to ask.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If there’s anything <i>The Pinkprint</i> makes clear over its sprawling 22 tracks (six of which appear only on deluxe editions), it’s that Nicki Minaj is exhausted. On intro ""All Things Go"", her delivery is pointedly plain as she reflects on her cousin Nicholas Telemaque’s 2011 murder, for which she blames herself, and references what may have been an abortion 16 years ago. ""I Lied"" grasps despondently at the loose ends of her unraveled relationship over Mike WiLL Made-It’s most haunting production of 2014. Later, Minaj convincingly paints her ex as an opportunistic scrub: ""You can never make eye contact, everything you got was based off of my contact,"" she snaps on ""Bed of Lies"". The closest thing to the carefree rave of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16471-pink-friday-roman-reloaded/""><i>Roman Reloaded</i></a> here is ""The Night Is Still Young"", but even there she’s consumed with creeping nostalgia for a party that has yet to end. It’s impossible to ignore her frequent mentions of pill-popping. ""I popped a perc and I said thonk youuuu!"" she crows on ""Want Some More""; it’s the most fucked up Minaj has sounded on wax, and she used to rap from the perspective of the lunatic child that lived in her brain.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> and masculinity, Minaj’s music has long centered around the performance of femininity. On her first two albums, that performance centered around femininity as a spectacle: the elaborate costumes, the affinity for lurid Barbie pink, the cartoonishly exaggerated ""SIGH"" on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JipHEz53sU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Super Bass""</a>. For an artist repeatedly defined by her gender in an art form historically biased against it, the preoccupation made sense. But on <i>The Pinkprint</i>, Minaj addresses a different performance: that of the ""strong woman,"" the self-sufficient bad bitch role model who works twice as hard as her male peers and looks good doing it (in other words, the performance of the ""only rap bitch on the Forbes list""). This, Minaj declares, is what the weight of your expectations has wrought, as she emerges from underneath them for the first time, as a heartbroken 32-year old who has sacrificed having a family to become the best rapper alive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Which raises the eternal question: is she, though? Minaj’s rapping on <i>The Pinkprint</i> is hardly a revival of her Smack DVD days, but the long-upheld fallacy of Mixtape Nicki as the gold standard against which her raps must be measured was due to be put to bed anyway. Under scrutiny, the habit of neatly dividing Minaj’s music into ""rap"" or ""pop"" doesn’t hold up. Few songs from her mixtape era can hold a torch to her bars on <i>Re-Up</i> bonus track ""The Boys"", the verbal acrobatics on ""Starships"" B-side ""Stupid Hoe"", or the upper-handed smirk of her ""Boss Ass Bitch (Remix)"". Though they might be delivered over sparkly pop synths, her rap skills have only sharpened over the last five years, and on <i>The Pinkprint</i>, they change form constantly. You want punchline-oriented Mixtape Nicki? She’s right there on ""The Crying Game"": ""Blood dripping out your arm, on my Asian rugs/ We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves"" cribs a flow straight from 2009. More impressive is ""Feeling Myself"", a show-stopping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a> duet that reads as a divine premonition of Bey’s eventual Gangsta Grillz installment. ""Bitches ain’t got punchlines or flow; I have both, and an empire also,"" Nicki repeats slowly and emphatically, as though she’s speaking to an idiot; they’re lines from <i>Re-Up</i> bonus track <a href=""http://vimeo.com/71881498"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Up In Flames""</a>, but maybe you didn’t hear her the first time.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Then there’s ""Four Door Aventador"", an uncanny <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"">Biggie</a> impression slipped in between twisted Atlanta homage ""Want Some More"" and R&amp;B floater ""Favorite"", with what feels like a knowing wink towards Rosenberg’s legion of ""serious hip-hop"" proponents. Rosenberg atoned for his remarks on air when Minaj returned to Hot 97 last year, but his apology (the ""sorry if you were offended"" type, peppered with qualifiers like ""underground"" and ""mainstream"") only amplified the source of the problem. Of course he only came at Minaj because, as a believer in her potential, he expected more from her. ""I was a women’s studies minor in college,"" he stressed. ""I’m the antithesis of that dude!"" His language will sound familiar to any woman who has been patronizingly told, ""I’m not sure if you have the capacity to understand what you’re doing the same way I do"" (presumably, then, to every woman on earth). On <i>The Pinkprint</i>, Minaj inches closer toward her goal of not just destroying the rap/pop binary, but smashing sexist challenges of her agency along with it, deading any lingering questions as to whether the most objectively successful female rapper of all time truly understands where her strengths lie. ""THIS is <i>The Pinkprint</i>,"" she declares on ""All Things Go"", and it’s loaded beyond a simple introduction a la <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eEQJ5Ap0aQ&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Is the Carter""</a>. It’s an outright rejection of any authority besides her own: ""No, THIS is what my music sounds like.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For an artist repeatedly accused of pandering to the unrefined palates of teenyboppers, <i>The Pinkprint</i>’s production and feature roster is surprisingly sophisticated, if a bit scattershot. The crew of collaborators ranges from trap innovator Zaytoven to casual diva <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a> to house producer Maya Jane Coles to someone credited simply as ""The Mad Violinist."" Though she hasn’t always worn it on her sleeve, Minaj has always had an acute understanding of what’s ""cool"" in rap and beyond, and it’s finally started to click. She slips sly contemporary references into <i>The Pinkprint</i> as little gifts for those paying attention: a quick nod, on ""Feeling Myself"", to O.T. Genasis’ viral hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vYnas6q3Sg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""CoCo""</a>, or the built-in inside joke of ""Want Some More"", its title a riff on Metro Boomin’s producer tag.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, <i>The Pinkprint</i>’s singles underwhelm, even in proper context. ""Pills N Potions"" is cute but hollow, its sentimentality trumped by the album’s deeply personal opening triptych. ""Anaconda"" makes more sense recontextualized as post-breakup stress release, but that doesn’t make it much more listenable. ""Only"" remains vile, a jizz-fest masquerading as an unfunny in-joke over a photocopy of a photocopy of a trap beat.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But they’re redeemed by the bonus tracks—a thrilling, confounding six-song set that elevates <i>The Pinkprint</i> from an occasionally transcendent, if unbalanced, break-up album to something far more intriguing. On ""Shanghai"", Minaj barks red-blooded bars, the kind ""real heads"" froth over, on a beat that could’ve been an outtake from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30056-fatima-al-qadiri/"">Fatima Al Qadiri</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19318-fatima-al-qadiri-asiatisch/""><i>Asiatisch</i></a>. Sequenced differently, ""Win Again"" may have been the album’s triumphant centerpiece, simultaneously a mission statement, victory lap, and warning shot (and there should be no confusion as to whom Minaj is inferring with ""Don’t write they raps and plus they flow shitty""). Stream-of-consciousness Auto-Tune freak-out ""Mona Lisa"" might be Minaj’s most bizarre album cut to date, gurgling ""I’ll fuck around and shoot youuuu"" through a Detail-produced benzodiazepine haze. ""Truffle Butter"" with Drake and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a> is such a lay-up of a radio hit, instantly 100 times more likeable than ""Only"", that it’s hard to understand its bonus track placement as anything other than mischievous trolling—Minaj giggling to herself as she tosses off precisely what her critics craved as little more than an afterthought. It’s the ultimate statement as to whether anyone but Minaj herself understands what’s best for her career. When many thought they’d had her pegged—as a New York battle-rapper, a predictable pop diva, a brand—<i>The Pinkprint</i> presents Minaj in her most unexpected role yet: a human being.</p></div>"|20058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20058-the-pinkprint/|7.5|Meaghan Garvey

Forged in the late-'00s crucible of the MySpace music scene and signed to a label when most people are trying to get through high school, Charlotte Aitchison was a critical darling long before she was a chart presence: after leaving a scrappy self-recorded debut in the dust, early singles like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12233-stay-away/"">""Stay Away""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12652-nuclear-seasons/"">""Nuclear Seasons""</a> picked up plaudits but failed to dent the conversation of casual pop fans. It took the surprise explosion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13584-i-love-it/"">""I Love It""</a>—a demo she tossed to Swedish party gremlins <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30420-icona-pop/"">Icona Pop</a> on a whim, and helped to sing—into an international hit to generate the momentum required for her first full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17880-charli-xcx-true-romance/""><i>True Romance</i></a>. An amalgamation of her best singles to date and some sterling new material, the album sated critics again but came and went without leaving any sort of commercial impression.</p>
<p>After peppy advance single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52432-video-charli-xcx-superlove/"">""SuperLove""</a> landed with a thud at the end of 2013, Charli found herself in a familiar position: beloved by pop Twitterati and devoted fans, but lacking the sort of chart firepower many felt her talent warranted. By the summer of 2014, the script had flipped: with assists from rapping Australian supernova Iggy Azalea and a soundtrack spot on teen drama <i>The Fault in Our Stars</i>, she had credits on the defacto Song of the Summer (the former's ""Fancy"") and her own solo top 10 hit, the swooning ""Boom Clap"". <i>Sucker</i> is her second studio album, and perhaps the years of hard work and compositional refinement it took to reach the top helped to shape the record's uncompromising sensibility; this is an album that seeks to bend the mainstream to its will rather than conform to its reigning trends. And in a bold display of self-confidence and strength of personality, it operates under the premise that Charli is a viable star even though the record will ultimately constitute a referendum on the validity of that assumption.</p>
<p>There's a great deal of volatility to Charli's writing and artistic growth, and it shows in both her evolution leading up to <i>Sucker</i> and the sound of the album itself. Her great early singles were glittering and booming and a little desperate, wrapped up in love in all of its life-or-death glory; on cuts like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQLCxjNTPs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""So Far Away""</a>, she sunk into swooning, gaseous dreamscapes. By the end of the period covered by <i>True Romance</i>, she had moved on to brash anthems for cool cheerleaders like ""I Love It"" and ""SuperLove""; disillusioned with the music industry in the time leading up to <i>Sucker</i>, she decamped to Sweden with producer pal Patrik Berger (whose credits are all over the finished product) and put together an unreleased roaring punk record that's already entered into the annals of pop myth. Imagine a world where the boisterous onomatopoeic chant that kicks off ""Boom Clap"" is sped up and made the whole song, and it's an even bigger hit somehow; that's the world of <i>Sucker</i>.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, it's a collection of colorful power-pop that occasionally veers outside the lines into punk and new wave; there are a few sentimental songs, but they're a lot more compact than the breathy, grand highlights of <i>True Romance</i>. And though Charli keeps the pace brisk and focuses more on speed and attitude than detail, there's a real sense of craft that seeps through cracks in the record's sneering facade. Rampaging highlights like the hilarious ""London Queen"" are still stained with harmony and impressive vocal layering. With its sharp riffs, tight structure, and confident, bratty snarl—tricks cribbed from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">Strokes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30345-keha/"">Kesha</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4103-gwen-stefani/"">Gwen Stefani</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a>—<i>Sucker</i> distances itself from the work of many other female pop stars that have ruled 2014: the Gothic precociousness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a>, the tidy lines and weaponized hooks of Taylor Swift, the focus group LCD pandering of Meghan Trainor. Its closest cousin might be One Direction's <i>Four</i>, a record that finds the hunky urchins steering into classic rock and gleaming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"">Phoenix</a>-like riffs; <i>Sucker</i> is a little harder to pin down, a little less formulaic.</p>
<p>Charli also seeks to differentiate herself from her peers through her attitude; she defines herself through her opposition to the machinery of the pop music industry, and through a sneering independent streak that's strong enough to be distinct but complementary rather than disruptive. Where other pop stars are reliant, even dependent, on the cultivation of relatability, she embraces and lampoons wealth and power and independence, often to humorous effect. On ""London Queen"", she conquers America, drives on the wrong side of the road to feel like JFK, and refuses to return to Britain until she's won enough to fill a wall with plaques. She builds a fortress out of money on the blown out ""Gold Coins"" and relaxes with a cigarette inside. She has a gift for line delivery that grants her put-downs a spiteful glow, and when she opens the raucous ""Breaking Up"" with, ""You had an ugly tattoo, and fucking cheap perfume!"" it's all the characterization the listener needs. <i>Sucker</i> is also a record that's largely detached from romance—any saccharine stuff, like girl group tribute ""Need Ur Luv"", is delivered with tongue firmly in cheek—and Charli is content to revel in hanging with friends and in her individual sexuality, like on salacious pro-masturbation romp ""Body of My Own"".</p>
<p>If you think this sounds like a lot to swallow, you're absolutely right; <i>Sucker</i> is a crowded and surprisingly dense record, given that the majority of its songs are concerned with the various fruits of stardom. It can be an exhausting listen if you're not fully prepared for its willfully destructive energy. The credits are stuffed with a wide breadth of writers and producers plucked from every corner of the contemporary pop world: industry superstars like Benny Blanco and Greg Kurstin, rising producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30860-cashmere-cat/"">Cashmere Cat</a>, indie darlings (Ariel Rechtshaid, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a>'s Rostam Batmanglij, gonzo doofus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>), and none other than Weezer godhead Rivers Cuomo (on the ""Beverly Hills"" rip ""Hanging Around""). That the album has any sort of coherence and consistency is a credit to Charli's personality and presence, her lust for life and palpable joy. And that may not be enough for some listeners. With its carefully chosen samples (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a>!) and swirling, love-drunk arrangements, <i>True Romance</i> oozed craft and measured cool; <i>Sucker</i> opens with a chorus built around the gleeful chant of ""Fuck you! Sucker!""</p>
<p>With that said, there's something undeniably exciting to me about a scenario in which a young fan, fresh out of falling in love with ""Boom Clap"" or ""Fancy"", comes to this record and discovers an uncompromising, ferocious talent, self-assured and empowered and incredibly versatile. <i>Sucker</i> isn't an endpoint for Charli—she's already <a href=""http://time.com/3616754/charli-xcx-sucker/http://time.com/3616754/charli-xcx-sucker/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talking about her next record</a>, inspired by J-pop and ""intensely weird and childlike""—and it's not her finest work, but it's plenty good enough to rope a cohort of new fans into what's promising to be one hell of a creative ride.</p></div>"|20066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20066-sucker/|7.6|Jamieson Cox

When he first began releasing music in 1996, Parrish and peers like Kenny Dixon Jr., Marcellus Pittman, Rick Wilhite, Andrés, and more did dance music that was not quite in step with the scene. Instead of futurism and the whirring machinations that informed Detroit’s sleekest export, techno, they preferred house’s slightly slower pulse, their tracks infused with their parents and grandparents’ record collections. Swells of church organ, the coos of R&amp;B, jazz’s swing, funk’s rhythmic gunk—some half-century’s worth of African-American music—teemed just beneath the kick drum.</p>
<p>But as house music tightened and grew sleeker, Parrish's tracks loosened and turned viscous. He began dropping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15952-uget/"" target=""_blank"">disco edits</a> and when edits began to flood the market soon after, his grew uglier. Deep house all the rage now? Well then, Parrish's most recent mix is comprised entirely out of charged <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Theo-Parrish-Theo-Parrishs-Black-Jazz-Signature/master/627989"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1970’s free jazz</a>. He’s as renowned for not giving you what you want in a DJ set as he is for delivering both the headiest and dankest dance music of the last 20 years.</p>
<p>He gives you all you can handle with <i>American Intelligence</i>, a title that with each passing news day feels more and more like an oxymoron. It’s his first album since 2007 and the end result is a massive listen, a two-hour collection (or else a slightly trimmed triple LP), with 10 of its 15 tracks approaching or breaking the 10-minute barrier. Within it, Parrish embraces the paradox of the title: indulgent and defiant, serious and cheeky, political yet intent on getting your dead ass to move. The man is musically generous, even if a copy in the shop might set you back $50.</p>
<p>The album opens with a subliminal bass tone that will set your subwoofer to trembling. He then carefully drips in closed hi-hats, a snare just a millimeter too fast, a ride cymbal that splatters like a circuit in a rain puddle, all of it embellishing a heart-quickening throb. Parrish then takes his sweet fucking time to whisper to his fellow countrymen: ""Where’s your drive? Has it died?"" He then answers himself: ""It keeps me alive.""</p>
<p>Throughout the length of this album, Parrish keeps to the sparest of rhythmic sounds. And as he put it in<a href=""http://lifeandtimes.com/theo-parrish-discusses-new-album-american-intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a recent interview</a>, that was his intent: ""What I try to get to is that part of everybody that is childlike and is simple, it goes to the rhythm, the repetition. The idea of a handclap that keeps happening over and over again is the most-simple thing that can happen and is something everybody can do and relate to."" He’s the Alice Waters of dance music, turning a handful of fresh ingredients into a feast. Often the rhythm tracks are erected out of little more than a live kick drum, tom, snare, hi-hat, dashes of other hand percussion (bells, rattles), with pads adding a bit more heft. Out of such Spartan percussion, he mesmerizes, to where introducing a new element 5-6 minutes deep suddenly turns revelatory. Some six minutes amongst the echoing bloops and zagging keys of ""Tympanic Warfare"", the drums start to sizzle and what once seemed abstract and not fully sketched out now feels solid.</p>
<p>The length of tracks slows down <i>AI</i> at some points, while some of the keyboard figures seem to echo melodies found elsewhere, which to newcomers might get misread as sameness. As rapturous as the beatless R&amp;B exhalations of vocalist Ideeyah are on ""Ah"", it would have been more effective and sublime at five minutes instead of 10. ""Helmut Lampshade"" turns into a jazz fusion robot run amok. The highway patrol dialogue on ""Welcome Back"" is a throwaway track, but there’s little doubt it’s rooted in the ugliest of truths about American racism, underscoring the political that is always just beneath the surface of Parrish's music and discourse.</p>
<p>The track well worth wading through is the 13 glorious minutes of ""Be In Yo Self"". Built from a shuffling cymbal that slowly gathers momentum, aspects of the track are smooth enough to scan as nu-jazz yet it still feels rooted and raw. Guitarist Duminie DePorres delivers a snaking Phil Upchurch-type guitar line as Ideeyah hums and harmonizes with herself, singing ad nauseam: ""Being yourself shouldn’t have a downside.""</p>
<p>As Parrish explained in the aforementioned interview, the song is ""almost kind of like a spiritual. It's a chant."" Midway through, the shift comes not from a new rhythmic element, but a lyrical one: ""Hey suga, would you dance a little bit closer to me?"" It’s deep, not so much in the house sense, but in an emotional way, an honest request to his betrothed. It’s Parrish at his most disarming, and coming as it does in his broad discography, it’s a most agreeable sound.</p></div>"|20057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20057-american-intelligence/|8.3|Andy Beta

As music consumption continues to shift toward digital methods of distribution, from illegal downloads that pay the artist nothing to authorized streams that pay very little, some makers are wondering just how they’ll continue to make. If the consumer isn’t willing to foot the bill with a sliver of their own income, how can the product exist?</p>
<p>Though the circumstances have changed in most every respect during the 80 years since the Paramount Records empire crumbled, this core question hasn’t: How do you keep putting music out when you’re no longer pulling money in? The success of Paramount Records, a loss-leader meant to move the music-playing furniture made by the Wisconsin Chair Company as World War I came to a close, was a surprise for the business’ leaders. The shoddily recorded and haphazardly manufactured shellac discs became a rather big boon as the '20s roared. Hired in 1923, J. Mayo Williams, an ambitious talent scout who had headed north from Arkansas, led the pivotal Paramount charge. He assembled and managed a roster of uncontested originals, from Blind Lemon Jefferson and Ma Rainey to Blind Blake and Jelly Roll Morton. But in 1927, Williams left the label following a series of injuries and insults from the company’s white owners and officers. That’s where the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18703-the-rise-fall-of-paramount-records-volume-one-1917-1932/"" target=""_blank"">first volume of <i>The Rise &amp; Fall of Paramount Records</i></a>—a massive two-set collaboration between Jack White’s <a href=""http://thirdmanrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Third Man</a>, John Fahey’s revived <a href=""http://www.revenantrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Revenant</a> and a fleet of researchers, writers, graphic designers, fabricators, builders, archivists, printers and collectors—closes.</p>
<p>Williams’ departure, though, isn’t the end of Paramount’s rise, even if it might denote the start of the fall. The second volume of <i>The Rise &amp; Fall </i>is instead a catalogue brimming with genius, no matter that the label’s scouts in fields and offices alike didn’t carry the same historical clout as Williams. Charley Patton and Son House, Lottie Kimbrough and Dock Boggs, Geeshie Wiley and Skip James, Thomas Dorsey and Emry Arthur: Those are only some of the names that arrive for this set, which stretches from 1928 until the label’s unceremonious end in the wake of the Great Depression in 1932. That’s when the money ran out for music.</p>
<p>The talent had not stopped shipping into Grafton’s record-pressing plant during that time of widespread financial woe. In fact, the 800 remastered tracks offered in <i>Volume Two</i> document the roots of gospel and swing and the intensification of blues and jazz through the efforts of some of American music’s formative musical minds. You can hear the earliest echoes of bluegrass, which would be born a dozen years after Paramount closed, and antediluvian traces of rock’n’roll, hot on its heels with added electricity.</p>
<p>The funds, however, just weren’t what they used to be. ""Despite many of the great talents he helps bring to Grafton, you can’t sell the records if no one has money to buy them,"" writes Scott Blackwood of the pale, bespectacled and pivotal Paramount recruiter Art Laibly. ""Likely, out on the road or riding the rails across the South, Art Laibly’s anxieties about the future would sometimes get the best of him. The Crash. The poor getting poorer. A part of him knowing the days of the Race Records business were numbered."" At least they kept it going long enough to firm up the foundation for their rather young country’s recording pedigree.</p>
<p>You can examine that foundation for yourself on <i>Volume Two</i>. You can ponder the existential strangeness of Patton’s still-singular approach to the blues and his divisive belief in both religion and the bottle. (His ""Prayer of Death"" tunes as Elder J.J. Hadley are essential.) You can sway to the woozy, wobbly string-band fare of the Mississippi Sheiks. You can nod and shake to the delirious a cappella spirituals of the Famous Blue Jay Singers of Birmingham, particularly the delirious and pulsing ""Clanka-A-Lanka (Sleep on Mother)"". Skip James’ inescapable ""Hard Time Killin’ Floor Blues"" is here, as are two versions of Dock Boggs’ ""Will Sweethearts Know Each Other"" and Geeshie Wiley’s <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/13/magazine/blues.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">continually magnetic and tragic</a> ""Last Kind Words Blues"". Had the unlikely and uncanny venture of Paramount never thrived, and had these songs never been captured, it’s easy to imagine the next several decades of music taking very different turns.</p>
<p>Not everything here changed the world, of course, and some of Paramount’s hidden gems arrive through its most obscure oddities. Brother Fullbosom’s ""A Sermon on a Silver Dollar"" is a racially and religiously irreverent faux testimonial to the power of that most almighty ducat. ""Wicked Treatin’ Blues"", a duet for despondent harmonica and vocals that seem delivered from a deathbed, hypnotizes with sadness. George Hamilton’s ""Chimes Blues"" offers a delightful piano jaunt. Ollie Hess’ parlor-ready ""Mammy’s Lullaby"" combines arching, urbane vocals and simply picked guitar—country, meet cosmopolitan. Two of the best and most truly haunting songs in the entire Paramount oeuvre belong to Rube Lacy, a little-known blues moaner who <i>only</i> recorded these two cuts as far as anyone can tell. In its waning days, without Williams in command, Paramount was grasping for anything to sell. Many of these didn’t do that, but thanks be to Paramount for thinking they might—they are wonderful, ponderous relics. The worst that can be said about any of these songs is that they’re simply curious; the best is that they’re landmarks.</p>
<p>The first volume of <i>The Rise &amp; Fall</i> came housed in an impressive chestnut box, lined with green felt and accessorized with metallic emblems. Its six LPs lived in a wooden record book, and the marbled brown vinyl looked as though it had been cut from the cross-section of some grand old oak. An accompanying USB drive—a ""Jobber-Luxe"", Third Man likes to call it—contained the central trove of songs and graphics in a tarnished brass device that seemed pulled from a steampunk’s wildest pipe dream. Both the design and the text were <a href=""http://www.grammy.com/nominees"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nominated for Grammys</a> in early December, and deservedly so.</p>
<p>You can expect much the same for <i>Volume Two</i>, which steps into the machine age through an aluminum replication of <a href=""http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/2290/RCA_Victor_Special_Model_K_Portable_Electric_Phonograph"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RCA Victor’s beautiful Special Model K portable record player</a>. When the outside latches are unlocked, sets of rivets on either half unscrew to reveal the contents—on one side, a packet of promotional Paramount reproductions and six alabaster white records that sparkle with holograms when lit; on the other, two dense books that detail what’s known about all the musicians involved on these tracks and Blackwood’s romantic history of the second Paramount era. A second USB drive sits lodged in this volume’s navy blue felt. It’s the Paramount eagle, wings up and cast in bright aluminum. The <a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/benwillmore/streamline-moderne-design/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Streamline Moderne</a> approach intends to pull the music from a past of rural antiquity and toward urban modernity. ""The machine was the source of America’s might and standing in the world,"" <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/10/paramount-records-box-set/#slide-id-1591217"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blackwood told <i>Wired</i> in October</a>, ""our capacity as an industrial power that connected the vast plains of our country.""</p>
<p>Still, it’s hard to see these sets as more than museum pieces, or, at best, fetishist collector items that lock vital research, history, and context away in a private vault with actual latches. Taken together, volumes one and two of <i>The Rise &amp; Fall of Paramount Records </i>are mighty resources for understanding how the near-century of music that has followed first moved. But it’s a shame that such indispensable history remains so relatively unobtainable. Issued in editions of 5,000, these bulky boxes cost $400 each; tellingly, the first volume is <a href=""http://thirdmanstore.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-paramount-records-1917-1932-volume-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">still available</a> through Third Man, more than a year after its release.</p>
<p>The price, believe it or not, is worth it. Given the work that went into each package, it’s hard to imagine that White is building his own private railroad with the profits. The treasures in the sets are staggering and sprawling, capable of inducing laughter, heartache, belief, and disbelief. There is bedrock and bedlam alike. But as Blackwood himself writes of a different but not entirely separate era, ""You can’t sell the records if no one has money to buy them."" It’s hard to believe that most people have an extra mortgage payment sitting around for this history lesson, however great it may be.</p>
<p>And that’s a shame, because this music still moves. Not only do many of these songs maintain a vibrancy and a spirit that function even now, but they’re part of a still-incomplete story. Paramount was infamously terrible at record-keeping and accounting, so researchers like archivist Alex van der Tuuk are still finding facts and chasing myths to build a more complete label history. ""Sun to Sun"", a steady-swerving Blind Blake tune recorded in November 1931, hadn’t been heard by modern ears until a copy was found in a steamer trunk in Raleigh, North Carolina, by<a href=""http://www.oldhatrecords.com/blindblakediscoveries.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> the collector Marshall Wyatt in 2007.</a> And Willie Brown, who contributes some of the best blues guitar to either set, remains something of a ghost, despite his relationships with the more famous House and Patton. ""No conclusive evidence has been found to prove that this is indeed the real Willie Brown,"" van der Tuuk writes of Brown’s believed burial site.</p>
<p>Such mysteries sit close to the core of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9384-do-not-sell-at-any-price-the-wild-obsessive-hunt-for-the-worlds-rarest-78rpm-records/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork contributor Amanda Petrusich’s 2014 book, <i>Do Not Sell at Any Price</i>.</a> ""There is even a vague fear that rare-record collecting could one day become analogous to fine-art collecting,"" Petrusich writes early in her book, ""the obligation of wealthy aristocrats whose consumption of art is more a statement of status than a function of love or even understanding."" It’s unfortunate, then, that in an age of infinite digital replication, where media need not be scarce, these archival releases have intentionally realized those fears by turning this music into artifacts for only those who can afford it. The new Jobber-Luxe contains an application that plays all of these tracks in specific orders or at random. If these boxes ever sell out, let’s hope Third Man considers its money made and puts that player online, so that more listeners can know exactly where they came from.</p></div>"|19889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19889-the-rise-fall-of-paramount-records-volume-two-1928-1932/|8.8|Grayson Haver Currin

A few months on, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9729-sinkane/"">Sinkane</a>’s Ahmed Gallab led an all-star tribute to Onyeabor. Over the course of concerts in London, New York, and Los Angeles, Gallab assembled the likes of Byrne, Damon Albarn, members of Hot Chip, the Rapture, and LCD Soundsystem, the Beastie Boys’ Money Mark, fellow Nigerian stars the Lijadu Sisters, Dead Prez, jazz star Joshua Redman and '60s free jazz legend Pharoah Sanders, Peaking Lights, and more to cover Onyeabor’s music live. There was also a documentary, a remix record for Record Store Day, and six commissioned original pieces of art by contemporary West African and American artists. Now follows a 9xCD box set (also split into two hefty vinyl boxes) that collects the entirety of William Onyeabor’s recorded output. But even after listening to all nine of these albums and absorbing the contributing essays from Mike Rubin (an expanded version of his <a href=""%20http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/arts/music/an-elusive-mystery-man-of-music.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0""><i>New York Times</i> profile</a>) and Nigerian author Chris Abani, as well as recollections of the search for the man from Luaka Bop’s Yale Evelev and Eric Welles, one question still remains: Who is William Onyeabor?</p>
<p>There’s little doubt that Luaka Bop turned over every single stone in their quest. They both talked to Onyeabor on the phone and traveled to his compound in Enugu. (Welles tells of his travels from Lagos to Nigeria’s “coal city,” where Onyeabor remains a prominent businessman, with a flour mill, gas station, Internet café, and record pressing plant, along with a street named after him and the honorific title of “High Chief.”) And they did ask Onyeabor personal questions while in his presence. But at almost every turn, he evaded specifics. And so very little biography on Onyeabor has been advanced beyond what was written on the back of his debut album, which calls him “a French and American trained professional film maker,” though the stories go that he also studied film in Russia. And when he returned to his native Nigeria, he had both filmmaking equipment as well as a trove of prohibitively expensive early synthesizers.</p>
<p>His 1977 debut <i>Crashes in Love</i> is subtitled “A tragedy of how an African Princess rejects love that money buys” and is presented to the record buying public as a soundtrack to Onyeabor’s film of the same name, though there seems to be no trace of the film. On the front cover is an advert for Onyeabor’s own Wilfilms, which produces, exhibits, and sells features and documentaries, as well as “Records, Motion Advert, General Entertainment, etc.” and the back features the disclaimer: “You may wish to know that it is neither all nor only the sounds contained in this album that are tracked in film.”</p>
<p>There are no credits other than that of Onyeabor, but there’s a full band behind him, a crisp backbeat of drums and hand percussion, horns, snaking guitar lines and bubbling bass, and female singers who sing “One day you’ll be lying dead” on the mortality funk of “Something You’ll Never Forget”. Onyeabor’s organ sounds less like a synthesizer prototype purchased in an Eastern bloc country and more like something airlifted from an Indiana rollerskate rink and what would be the primary instrument on future albums is relegated to accompaniment instead, the horn line and bass. </p>
<p>On <i>Crashes in Love</i>, Onyeabor is of a piece with his Nigerian contemporaries—the album bears similarity to the likes of other mid-70s bands like BLO, the Funkees, and Ofege. The title track has a lilt to it as if at any moment the melody might veer off into a particularly light-footed take on “Red Red Wine” while “Heaven &amp; Hell” sports the kind of breakbeat that would have led beat heads to seek the album out in the first place. It closes with one of Onyeabor’s stranger songs, “Jungle Gods”, featuring roiling bass and thundering percussion, Onyeabor speaking in echoplexed tongues. It’s also an outlier in that the sense that soon after followed a second version of <i>Crashes in Love</i>, now minus “Jungle Gods”. The alternate version of this album sounds ever so slightly sped up on “Something You Will Never Forget”, and now features a sputtering drum machine atop every other song.</p>
<p>In his essay to the box set, Abani recalls hearing Onyeabor’s “Atomic Bomb” on the way to seminary, where it vies for attention with Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, Michael Jackson, Fela Kuti, and Bob Marley amid the din of the marketplace. Not even a few months later, Abani and his fellow Nigerian classmates attended an assembly on the nuclear threat and later that night dance to the ecstatic eight minutes of “Atomic Bomb”, which inverts that world-destroying fear into an expression of love. </p>
<p>On Onyeabor’s 1978 album,he ditches his dream of being a filmmaker and emerges as a singular musical artist. Opener “Beautiful Boy” features a relaxed loping beat, the organ now resembling a ray gun from a '50s alien invasion, Onyeabor unveiling a soft croon to a woman, “I’m gonna take you home.” Elsewhere, he furthers his loverman persona, singing “My love, I need you all my life.” Another undeniable groove powers “Better Change Your Mind”, the most politically-engaged Onyeabor song and the catalyst for Luaka Bop’s search for Onyeabor when they included it on <i>Love's A Real Thing: The Funky Fuzzy Sounds Of West Africa</i>.  </p>
<p><i>Tomorrow</i>, his third album in as many years, now featuring Onyeabor in a velvety double-breasted suit, begins to move away from the solid groove of Afrobeat towards something more diaphanous. The drums and bass loosely twine about Onyeabor and his female backup singers, their vocals unhurried, the organ squirreling in, out, above and around the rhythm. “Why Go to War” has what sounds like a Slinky threaded through an electric guitar and then nervously plucked, continuing Onyeabor’s mind being on both the smallest of affairs between man and woman and the mutually assured destruction of the world. The album also features what some 35 years later might be Onyeabor’s greatest pop ""hit,"" the preening funk of “Fantastic Man” (which you can now hear on ads for <i>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</i>). And no wonder—it’s a doozy, Onyeabor peacocking before a group of females even as he steps on a disco duck and has a UFO crash land on his fly threads.</p>
<p>“Body &amp; Soul”, the title track off his next album, has made its rounds on open-minded dancefloors via a few different 12” pressings. It scans as Afrobeat while maintaining a slack beat, suggesting downtempo, reggae, funk and disco, with modular synth bleeps without ever being beholden to any one of them. Instead Onyeabor (dapper in a white tuxedo on the album sleeve) testifies to his love of music, body and soul. But the rest of the album maintains a relaxed grip on Afrobeat, “The Way to Win Your Love” urgent in its pleading if not its meter. While on “Poor Boy,” Onyeabor's keyboard blurts are hurried and the interplay between horns, drums, and synths are some of the most intricate to date.</p>
<p><i>Great Lover</i> is the album I’m least familiar with, in that only “Love is Blind” –with its “Ring My Bell”-esque synth swoops– was previously compiled. It continues Onyeabor’s run of swag covers, now posing in a tux and tophat, his wristwatch bling-sized. On the back are photographs of the Wilfilms compound, which seems formidable indeed in rural Africa circa 1981, with a four-story building, 24-track recorder, 32-track mixing console and a photo of Onyeabor wearing that top hat indoors with the caption “We Mean Business” underneath. “Tell Me What You Want” shows Onyeabor absorbing reggae and its lilting rhythms, his keys chirping and pinging like island birds and the album itself sounds cloaked in haze, either from there being missing master tapes or the condition of the copy sourced here. But such sonic haze no doubt will endear it to Ariel Pink, Lewis and DaM-Funk fans, or those who now associate low fidelity with heightened mystery. </p>
<p><i>Hypertension</i> finds our mystery man now dressed as a mariachi band member, right down to a blood-red sombrero. But musically he seems taken with calypso and soca and other Caribbean rhythms on “The Moon and the Sun” and “Papa Na Mama”. That amalgam of island beats, disco sensibilities, and Onyeabor’s warped synths bring to mind compilations like <a href=""%5Bhttp://www.discogs.com/Various-Tropical-Disco-Hustle/master/757213""><i>Tropical Disco Hustle</i></a>, showing a strange kinship between the Caribbean and Nigeria during the Year of <i>Thriller. </i> </p>
<p>By the next year, a greater urgency underlies <i>Good Name</i> (Onyeabor now sporting a white cowboy hat and gold crucifix chain), a two-track album with one song apiece taking up an entire side. In much the same way that a continent away Indian pedal steel guitarist Charanjit Singh invented acid house with <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Charanjit-Singh-Synthesizing-Ten-Ragas-To-A-Disco-Beat/master/225128"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat</i></a> in 1983, Onyeabor himself seems to be anticipating the rise of the machines. Squelches and throbs propel “Let’s Fall in Love”, continuing Onyeabor’s foremost inspirations, God and love. On “Good Name”, the guitars sear, the sputtering drum machines skitter fast as rats, and Onyeabor’s keys bear a frayed and serrated tone as he sings—a trace of desperation in his voice—how “no money can buy a good name.”</p>
<p><i>Anything You Sow</i>, the Onyeabor album that first entranced me, was also his last album before he gave his life (and every subsequent interview answer) over to Christ, turning his back on his musical output. Sampled by Caribou (under his Daphni alias) and no doubt a template for the likes of Four Tet, LCD Soundsystem, Peaking Lights, and James Holden, to name a few, Onyeabor’s influence can most easily be gleaned here on primitive-futuristic tracks like “Everyday” and “This Kind of World”. Over a joyous splutter of a beat on “When the Going is Smooth &amp; Good”, Onyeabor couches a bitter pill. Perhaps a commentary on Onyeabor’s own status at the time of his conversion, the song rails against people who soothe in good times only to evaporate in bad, or worse still, “to help in knocking you down down down.”</p>
<p>In the past decade, the only other Nigerian artist to merit such a career-spanning box set was Fela Kuti, yet in some ways it’s odd to consider William Onyeabor an equal. While Fela was truly a force of nature (the year of <i>Crashes in Love</i>’s release, Fela himself recorded and released six albums), Onyeabor seems, for lack of a better word, meeker (if more liable to keep his stylish shirt on). Fela's music feels irreducible as steel while Onyeabor's is curiously ductile. An enemy of the state as opposed to a respected businessman. Both were politically-minded, though it’s hard to compare Onyeabor to the vociferously outspoken Kuti.</p>
<p>A God-fearing man making sweet, light-hearted ditties in juxtapose to a demiurge with a compound full of women, yet both men have greatly influenced western music-making in the late 20th century and early 21st century. Fela’s influence spans from Brian Eno to Talking Heads on up to Broadway and his revolutionary music can be felt in an instant, but Onyeabor’s was quiet and every bit as revelatory. Folks tinkering with analog gear and archaic drum machines and how to make such machines express sweet-hearted human sentiment may not have realized Onyeabor’s example until reaching this precise thin layer of sediment buried deep down in reissue culture. Perhaps then Onyeabor’s renaissance will be closer to that of Arthur Russell’s, both of their catalogs continuing to find resonance among those fiddling with gear, be it in their bedrooms or in their compounds.</p></div>"|20056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20056-box-set/|9.0|Andy Beta

""The sound of an air conditioner, the rhythm of a pen falling down, a conversation from other people,"" are just some of the ho-hum influences on his music that he mentions in an <a href=""http://hihiwhoopee.tumblr.com/post/37467483515/interview-canooooopy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview with Japanese music blog Hi-Hi-Whoopee</a>, capping his answer off with ""a monotonous life."" Canooooopy subscribes to a ""100% sampling"" ethos, and builds every track on his first CD release <i>Disconnected Words Connect the Worlds</i> from noises that seem innocuous enough in their original context—an automated telephone greeting, people chatting, children singing. Yet he’s able to warp them into disjointed little worlds, and <i>Disconnected</i> serves as a solid introduction to one of the wonkier beatmakers to pop up out of Japan over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>A lot of what makes Canooooopy interesting emerged via a recent collaborative project, wherein he teamed up with fellow Japanese trackmakers <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/lidly/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lidly</a> and <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/axion-aka-shuya-sato"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Axion117</a> to form <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ganghousefungi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ganghouse Fungi</a>. That trio’s work often featured experimental dashes that hinted at what Canooooopy would do on <i>Disconnected</i>, but his partners hailed from a more traditional crate-digging beat scene, one influenced by the sound of American hip-hop and favoring jazz samples. Canooooopy, meanwhile, appears tied to nothing—he loads up on samples and field recordings and melds them together into forms few rappers could contend with, all in Garageband (an approach he shares with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>, who along with James Brooks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31594-default-genders/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Default Genders </a>have shared Canooooopy’s music online).</p>
<p>Despite the herky-jerky nature of his collage approach to music, Canooooopy shows an attention to detail on <i>Disconnected</i> that makes his best tracks click just right. ""Viral Address Stalker"" kicks off by nabbing the intro to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5136-marnie-stern/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Marnie Stern</a>’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5136-marnie-stern/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""> </a>""Plato’s Fucked Up Cave"" (""Get me out of this prison, man/ Let me run, run, run, run, run"") and looping her stuttered ""run,"" building a beat around it before playing with the vocal some more. ""Songs About a Sunken Hope"" bounces between various vocal samples of British-accented words and syllables, Canooooopy timing it just right so no voice rams into the other and everything syncs with the skittery beat. Even brief numbers such as ""Kaleido World Mysty Sisters"" and ""Doppelinedancerstomps"" treat every second and sound with care, not wasting anything during their 90-second runtimes.</p>
<p><i>Disconnected</i>’s jagged construction also emphasizes an eerie atmosphere, the rush of voices often making for some uneasy moments. Sometimes it’s simply an unexpected sound—""Mono Montaged Oratorio"" is packed with sampled dialogue, but none comes through headphones more clearly than a cutesy voice saying ""baby"" for a jarring second. Usually, though, Canooooopy lets the mishmash of sounds create an unnerving feel that lingers over the entire beat, such as on the bouncy ""Too Long Way Home"", where voices mixed deep in the track constantly sneak into the main rhythm. The album suffers when Canooooopy strips the music down and tries to create something creepy with minimalism, as he’s at his best when sounds jumble together and unsettling moments emerge from the clamor.</p>
<p>Even though Canooooopy has an attentive eye when it comes to individual tracks, <i>Disconnected</i> doesn’t quite click together as an album, as certain stretches of it can get a little too cluttered. But then an individual track will burst through—such as the burbling ""The Polygonic Spree"" or clattering ""The Phantom of the Gauss""—and remind how he’s able to turn a scattershot collection of samples into something otherworldly. It’s a great introduction to a producer able to alchemize the everyday into the surreal.</p></div>"|20038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20038-disconnected-words-connect-the-worlds/|6.9|Patrick St. Michel

Cole</a> is a student of hip-hop, the kind who moves to New York to stalk Jay-Z for an opportunity to rap for him, peppers his lyrics with nods to the greats, and pens an apology to Nas when his biggest single comes across as too poppy. Cole is aware of the structure and pace of good rap albums and anxious to apply them to his own music. For his third record, <i>2014 Forest Hills Drive, </i>he channels the nostalgic self-mythology of Jay-Z’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4219-the-black-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black Album</i></a>. The cover is shot at his childhood home as Eminem did on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marshall_Mathers_LP"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Marshall Mathers LP</i></a>. The tracklist swaps s’s for z’s (“Wet Dreamz”, “A Tale of 2 Citiez”, “Love Yourz”) like 2pac’s <i>All Eyez on Me</i>. With <i>2014</i>, Cole is certain he’s made his classic; he’ll tell you as much partway through the 15-minute credit roll “Note to Self”, which apes Kanye West’s joyous, candid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/"" target=""_blank""><i>College Dropout </i></a>closer “Last Call”. Problem is, Cole hasn’t earned it yet.</p>
<p class=""normal"">J. Cole is a workmanlike MC, a good-natured populist grappling with the ridiculousness of sudden celebrity. He makes passable albums with memorable singles. He’s great at synthesizing everyman relationship woes into terse pop nuggets. He works well with guests; his collaborations with Drake, Missy Elliott, and TLC are highlights in his growing body of work, and he gets along so well with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a> that the duo is rumored to have clandestinely recorded an EP together. In its quest to canonize Cole, <i>2014 Forest Hills Drive </i>eschews both singles and guests. It’s a block of Cole raps and Cole hooks served mostly over Cole beats. Bold move, and where it floats, it soars, but it flops gloriously when it doesn’t.</p>
<p class=""normal"">The laughable wordplay fails of mixtapes albums past (“My money like a senior, watch it graduate,” “Cole heating up like that leftover lasagna”) are thankfully absent, but Cole isn’t yet sharp enough of a storyteller to carry a full album on his own. “Wet Dreamz” recounts his first time having sex in lurid detail, from lying to a girl about his prowess to looking at porn for pointers to finding out the girl’s been lying, too. It’s relatable but hardly the kind of story you want to hear more than once. “No Role Modelz” parlays a suspicion about a hookup being a golddigger into a tirade about black women lacking respectable public figures, crudely suggesting that “she’s shallow but the pussy deep.” (For all the talk of Cole’s enlightenment he’s a perfect brute when it comes to women, and “No Role Modelz” is something of a tacit admission.) <i>2014 Forest Hills Drive </i>often plays at a depth it never delivers.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Still, ceding an entire hour to a rapper who works best in short bursts works better here than anyone could’ve expected. “03’ Adolescence” flips the classic rags-to-riches narrative inside out as Cole starts to reminisce about how hard he had it growing up only to get a chin check from a friend whose future isn’t half as bright. “G.O.M.D.”, “Fire Squad”, and “A Tale of 2 Citiez” all flash Cole’s technical excellence, while “Intro”, “Apparently”, and “St. Tropez” emote through his gruff singing voice. The production here is never less than delightful; Cole’s own beats run coyly referential samples through milky instrumental embellishments. “Wet Dreamz” is an adept “Impeach the President” flip, and “St. Tropez” reimagines Mobb Deep’s “Give Up the Goods (Just Step)” as sedate, orchestral R&amp;B.</p>
<p class=""normal""><i>2014 Forest Hills Drive </i>is Cole planting himself in the pantheon of rap greats, a volley to the spike of Kendrick Lamar’s “Control” verse. He gets more than a little ahead of himself, though, claiming to be better than Slick Rick, LL Cool J, Rakim, and Big Daddy Kane on “January 28th”. Kane and Rakim’s flows were tighter, LL’s swagger is inimitable, and Rick’s stories surge with a purpose nothing in J. Cole’s canon can muster. This self-aggrandizing pageantry is a ultimately bad look on a guy who earns his keep speaking to the struggles of the common man, and these songs work best when they’re not busy telling you how good they think they are. <i>2014 Forest Hills Drive </i>is a decent album selling itself as great. It wraps itself in the garments of a classic, but you can see that the tailoring is off.</p></div>"|20054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20054-2014-forest-hills-drive/|6.9|Craig Jenkins

It's frontloaded with three takes on ceremonially pounding highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16789-ben-frost-venter/"">""Venter""</a>, followed by versions of the equally forceful ""Nolan"" and the calmer drone piece ""No Sorrowing"". Frost mines a hard, ferrous seam between multiple genres related by intensity and repetition, and these remixes isolate them in individual strands—noise (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32147-dutch-e-germ/"">Dutch E Germ</a>), ambient (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29775-htrk/"">HTRK</a>), dance (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30208-evian-christ/"">Evian Christ</a> and Kangding Ray), and industrial (Regis). This results in diluted tracks that either pale in comparison to the brawny originals, seem superficially connected to them, or both. It would be a tall order to expect them to rival Frost's raw power, but these remixes don't unearth much fascinating stuff, and the EP turns out (mostly) competent but wan.</p>
<p>Evian Christ turns ""Venter"" into regal, explosive EDM, coring its melody down to a nervy screw and cladding it in huge basses and time-bomb drum programming. Though it's the most immediate track here, this pro forma banger is neither particularly inspired nor particularly Frost—it really could be any Evian Christ song. A less splashy but more satisfying composition is <a href=""http://www.raster-noton.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Raster-Norton</a> artist Kangding Ray's ""No Sorrowing"". On the original, a lone subfrequency drop in acres of long tones suggested walking over crystalline plains and suddenly falling into a pit; Ray retrofits it as rough-textured house music, like Frost as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27655-jon-hopkins/"">Jon Hopkins</a>. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Downwards-Records/255360997821158?sk=wall"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Downwards</a> label proprietor Regis gives ""Nolan"" a solid, somewhat similar treatment, but more gnarled and industrial.</p>
<p>And then there's the Dutch E Germ remix of ""Venter"", which is actually pretty bad. Dominated by shrapnel-like blasts of noise and an annoying squeak like a rusty wheel, it's repetitive and grating without being transfixing. A desultory, imbalanced structure changes without going anywhere in particular. Jagged tone pileups and irritating shrills are just the kind of harshness-for-its-own-sake that Frost eschews in favor of clear, commanding compositions. HTRK's version follows it and comes as a relief. You won't be surprised to hear that the Australian down-tempo duo turns it into chill-out music, reducing its tribal drums to a hollow knock and then blowing thin currents of atmosphere around a lone fillip of bass. It's a little tedious, though it's sensual and hypnotic if you let yourself flow into it.   </p>
<p>The most fundamental, buried part of Frost's aesthetic is classical minimalism, a strand that is left undisturbed by these surface-level retrofits. A remix EP that exhumed it could provide actual interest and value, but it doesn't seem like that much thought went into this—it's par for the course that instead of creating a new, coherent collection, you send out stems to some people you like and hope for the best. These kinds of remixes can make for great bonus tracks and promotional freebies—and hey, if someone wants to pay for them as a collection, more power to Frost. But if you need another reminder of the pointlessness of the remix EP as a commercial artifact, here it is.</p></div>"|20053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20053-v-a-r-i-a-n-t-ep/|5.0|Brian Howe

The album had the anthemic songs to justify being a formal debut, electric tracks like “Let It Go”, “Shabba”, “Work (Remix)” and the majestical “Hood Pope”. Though Ferg’s name probably wouldn’t pop up in the screenplay for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2784678/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Top Five</i></a>, his energy and charm carried him through the material, blowing through wide-open running lanes thanks to a “HOOO!” or two. </p>
<p>That <i>Ferg Forever </i>is a free mixtape, then, says it all; the quality is a mixed bag, and the sonic threads are far less uniform. Much like <i>Trap Lord</i>, Ferg relies on a stable of up-and-coming producers—two highlights in particular, “Fergsomnia” and “Dope Walk”, are respectively produced by VERYRVRE and Stelios Phili. He’s also collected tracks from known entities such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"" target=""_blank"">Big K.R.I.T</a>., whose woozy direction on “Bonnaroo” feels out of place (not to mention that all Ferg does is list off ways he picked around at Bonnaroo) and Mike WiLL Made It, who teams up with Tinashe” on the flat “Thug Cry (Remix)”. There’s a dancehall song, “Jolly”, along with an ode to group anal sex (“Weaves”) which makes the “I FUCKED YOUR BITCH” refrain on <i>Trap Lord </i>lowlight “Dump Dump” feel downright classy. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> even shows up on ""Talk It"", but his typically insistent energy is swapped for the effort of a goth teenager picking around in the “Mario Paint” song editor. Mixtapes are often dumping grounds for whatever comes to the artist’s mind, but here, it’s hard to argue for the form.</p>
<p>Still, the tape shines in the right places—the parts where it’s fun. Take “Fergsomnia”, whose stupendously goofy “FERGSOMNIA!” chant gives way to a characteristically knotty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4345-twista/"" target=""_blank"">Twista</a> verse. The reworked “Reloaded (Let It Go Pt. 2)” is a blast, full of “YAH!” ad-libs, a pair of blazing verses from Crystal Caines and Ferg’s former tour partner, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a>, and a hilariously deployed sample from the slightly more famous <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Let It Go”</a>. It’s within these tracks that Ferg finds his voice, and while relationship songs like ""Commitment Issues"" have their heart in the right place, the undercooked, stream-of-consciousness recaps never tap into the glee of the highlights.</p>
<p>Even so: Ferg is a compelling young dude trying shit out, so it’s hard to fault the weaknesses of <i>Ferg Forever</i> too much. This wasn’t released as his sophomore album, after all, and in the meantime it’s interesting to watch Ferg style-sample, freewheel deliveries and rotate producers. Not everything floats, but if the shelf life of jams like “Shabba” are any indication, the handful of hits on <i>Forever</i> will hold Fergensteins over till <i>Trap Lord</i>'s sequel is out in stores.</p></div>"|20048.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20048-ferg-forever/|6.4|Corban Goble

Younger than his unkempt facial hair would suggest, he'd already recorded the song, ""Awwsome"", which would enter ""MTV Jams"" rotation and is currently making its way across rap radio. The obnoxious, but loveable anthem of self-satisfaction appeared on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>’s late-2013 mixtape <i>No Sleep</i> as one of many tracks from lesser known trap rappers. The song was in no rush to become a hit, so over the past months Glizzy put in the work to have everything come together for the release of his second mixtape of the year, <i>Law 3: Now or Never</i>.</p>
<p>Within D.C., the 21-year-old rapper was already a known quantity in the early 2010s after putting out reliable but pedestrian mixtapes. But the February release of his <i>Young Jefe</i> tape finally extended his popularity. A strong exercise in melodic conciseness, nearly every song on it featured a memorable hook (""I’m so high that I can make a snow angel"") or a wisely timed adlib (""Goddamn goddamn""). Though none quite caught on like ""Awwsome"", tracks like ""I’m on Fire"", ""Or Nah"", ""Coca Loca"", and the memorable yet morbid ""Catch a Body"" easily could sit between other breakout rap stars from the year like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32502-dej-loaf/"">Dej Loaf</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"">iLoveMakonnen</a>, or Bobby Shmurda without a blink. To follow up a tape with that number of bangers could be intimidating, but <i>Law 3</i> brazenly exceeds it.</p>
<p>Shy Glizzy on record is rarely bashful so it only makes sense that <i>Law 3</i> features songs titled ""Cocky"", ""Celebration"", and ""Legend"". That self-assurance helps sell him when stomping across evergreen rap topics like the drug trade, gunfire, and money. He commits, quite convincingly, to every word. So when he spits ""Take me out these handcuffs/ I like to eat salmon/ I can’t be in handcuffs"" on ""Handcuffs"", the plea is not of frustration at the law, but at the spiteful peers that want to see him fail, and would deny him a seafood dinner.</p>
<p>Earlier this year contributor Lawrence Burney <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/403-the-rise-of-dc-street-rap/"">explored</a> that possibility that, through street rap, D.C. could finally see broader success in a post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"">Wale</a> world. Here, Glizzy stuck to that model, choosing to keep working with two of his most reliable producers: trap legend Zaytoven and the undervalued K.E. on the Track. Unlike a number of other major cities, D.C. is not burdened with a specific definition of what a rapper from the city could or should sound like; when rappers of the city range from the '90s throwback of Oddisee to the post-Tumblr rap of Yung Gleesh to the hardened trap of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29863-fat-trel/"">Fat Trel</a>, there is clearly no singular path to follow. Glizzy’s chosen nasally half-sung style allows him to work well with any artist from Chicago or Atlanta and still fit comfortably next to Lor Scoota’s distinctively Baltimore accent with his regional hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYCjLzyZ3UI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bird Flu""</a>.</p>
<p>The cover of <i>Young Jefe</i> evoked the '80s film <i>Scarface</i>, which is not an unfamiliar motif for a young rapper seeking to assert his own gangster machismo. But there is a real harshness to Glizzy’s music on <i>Law 3</i> that rises above his last tape’s cartoonish bombast. On the early highlight ""Funeral"" Glizzy approaches his death the same way he deals with his mortality: Extravagantly and violently, as he raps ""It's gon' be some superstars at my funeral…You might get your ass robbed at my funeral."" There is no tension here for Glizzy, he accepts the reality that such opulence could come with consequences. It's a fitting sentiment for Glizzy's past year: 2014 was full of opportunity for him, and <i>Law 3</i> finds a rapper refusing to take it easy on his way to success.</p></div>"|20062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20062-law-3-now-or-never/|7.5|David Turner

For eight minutes, amplifiers and instruments scream the sort of feedback, static, and clipped tones that are endemic both to his caterwauling <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/73138-BLOODYMINDED"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">power-electronics band Bloodyminded</a> and his long-running <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/5406-BloodLust!"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">extreme experimental imprint, Bloodlust!</a> The sounds grow evermore dense, ultimately forming a thicket of prevailing hiss. But beneath and around the din, a repetitive guitar riff—just a few notes, really, folding into each other via delay and reverb—illuminate the abrasion, flickering like the light of a warm cabin spotted through a snowstorm. It’s not an accessibility concession that the wonderfully barbaric Bloodyminded would dare make.</p>
<p><i>Ciphers + Axioms</i> is, instead, the intriguing second album from Solotroff’s Chicago supergroup Anatomy of Habit. The album's dual tracks each clock in around 20 minutes, as did the paired cuts from<a href=""https://anatomyofhabit.bandcamp.com/album/anatomy-of-habit-lp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> their self-titled 2011 debut</a>; a <a href=""https://anatomyofhabit.bandcamp.com/album/anatomy-of-habit-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">subsequent EP</a> split those times into a still not-quite-concise half. Despite the lengths, though, Anatomy of Habit is Solotroff’s relative pop band. He speaks and sings instead of screams, and he moves in lockstep time to guitars, drums and bass, all sharing intentions beyond aural obliteration. Each of these songs has at least <i>one </i>hook you’ll be able to hum, as Solotroff’s strange and droll monotone echoes in your head. During <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18744-bloodyminded-within-the-walls/"" target=""_blank""><i>Within the Walls</i>, Bloodyminded’s most recent LP,</a> Solotroff yelled lines like, ""mounds of bodies lying unburied"" and ""air so fouled by the pungent stench of millions of dead children."" If you encounter temporary cognitive dissonance while singing along to songs about science and seasons with his Mark Mothersbaugh-meets-They Might Be Giants intonation, just trust that you’re not the only one.</p>
<p>Solotroff has long been a very busy and involved collaborator, but in recent years, his partnership has added unexpected elements to pre-existing projects. He supplied, for instance, essential blasts of abrasion to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18827-indian-from-all-purity/"" target=""_blank""><i>From All Purity</i></a>, the latest and best record from Chicago metal act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30075-indian/"">Indian</a>. And there’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31484-wrekmeister-harmonies/"">Wrekmeister Harmonies</a>, the slow-moving and cinematic collective that works between poles of orchestral splendor and doom furor. Aside from founder J.R. Robinson, Solotroff is one of the project’s sole stable and necessary elements. Such integration is key to <i>Ciphers + Axioms</i>. Only Solotroff and Kenny Rasmussen return from Anatomy of Habit’s earlier iteration, but the new members are copacetic by any standard: Will Lindsay, whose brawny riffs lead the aforementioned Indian, commandeers guitar, while indispensable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> and session drummer John McEntire takes the kit. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2197-joan-of-arc/"">Joan of Arc</a>’s Theo Katsaounis accents the beats with auxiliary percussion. Chicago metal stalwart Sanford Parker engineered the sessions in McEntire’s Soma Electronic Music Studios. This is an enviable cast of contributors.</p>
<p>Together, they are excellent. In particular, the rhythm section of McEntire, Katsaounis, and Rasmussen’s burly and distorted bass works as one of the record’s great assets. During ""Radiate and Recede"", they power ahead like a seasoned but smart doom band. They pull back in the perfect places, allowing Lindsay’s gnarled riffs and Solotroff’s enigmatic words to cut through their rests. After introducing ""Then Window"" with an unstable shock of feedback, Lindsay cycles subtly through a series of strong-arm riffs and phantom countermelodies. Katsaounis and McEntire match him in the background, adding touches of bells and woodblocks to drums that suggest an incoming infantry.</p>
<p>The occasional nature of Anatomy of Habit—in particular, this first-time lineup—cuts both ways. There’s a sense of discovery to <i>Ciphers + Axioms</i>, as the members seem to be negotiating their way through domains of post-rock and doom, math rock and post punk collectively. By record’s end, you want them to keep navigating. During the album, though, the nebulous configuration can produce frustrating results. ""Radiate and Recede"" depends too much on its start-and-stop, quiet-loud-and-louder structure, as the band flips again and again between loaded metal lurch, eerie ambient crawl, and mid-paced art-rock shuffle. A veteran group might get much the same result with an editing overhaul. That symptom also coincides with how Solotroff sounds a touch uncomfortable, or at least not fluid, in his new role as an enunciating frontman. The speak-sing spans of ""Radiate and Recede"" are forced and stiff, as if he were trying to raise his voice without screaming. He is more at ease and more convincing when he’s actually singing, as when he repeats the title phrase near the middle of the smoldering ""Then Window"". He airs those words as if to himself, a writer contemplating his own elliptical poetry aloud. And then the band drops into that long, droning finale, its squall wired by Lindsay’s alluring guitar line. You’re left with the suggestion of future possibilities for this take on Anatomy of Habit.</p></div>"|19956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19956-ciphers-axioms/|7.0|Grayson Haver Currin

This is the basic origin story of “Iron Man”, the comic book franchise that gave <span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah"">Ghostface Killah</a>, aka Tony <i>Starks</i>,</span> his first album title and likely, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnsWlBi8YPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>his last shot at a major movie role</span></a>. It is also the essence of 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17872-ghostface-killah-adrian-younge-twelve-reasons-to-die"">Twelve Reasons to Die</a></i>, where a linear narrative of revenge was told over live-band, time-stamped soul music with the guidance of a young and new collaborator. Does that also sound familiar? It should if you’ve heard anything about <i>36 Seasons</i>; the main difference is that Adrian Younge is exchanged for Brooklyn revivalists <a href=""http://therevelations.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Revelations</a> and that Tony Starks doesn’t actually die before he rains vengeance upon those who have wronged him.</p>
<p>One can see this continuous and considerable narrowing of Ghostface Killah’s artistic scope as a course correction or an apology to his hardcore fanbase; penance for the shameless bids for commercial relevance on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10965-the-big-doe-rehab/"">The Big Doe Rehab</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13537-ghostdini-the-wizard-of-poetry-in-emerald-city/"">Ghostdini: The Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City</a></i>. The sadder truth is that Ghostface has been in an artistic tailspin for the past seven years and, as with <i>Twelve Reasons to Die</i>, there seems to be a tacit acknowledgement that he can’t pull out unless someone else takes the controls.</p>
<p>Though still credited to Ghostface Killah, <i>36 Seasons</i> is a truly collaborative work. Comic book artist Matthew Rosenberg returns to provide the storyline and Ghostface doesn’t even appear on nearly a third of the tracks, which are earmarked for character introductions and a chance for the Revelations to show their neo-soul credentials. While nowhere near as fantastical as <i>Twelve Reasons</i>’ supernatural storyline—Ghostface was a hired gun murdered by his employees and his remains were melted into 12 vinyl albums—<i>36 Seasons</i> is far more promising. In short, Tony Starks was keeping Staten Island in check just with his presence, but for reasons that aren’t quite clear, he’s exiled for nine years; that amounts to “36 seasons,” as Ghostface constantly reminds the listener throughout. He returns home and sees his girl take up with a local drug kingpin (played by Kool G Rap) and his former running buddy (voiced by AZ) joins the boys in blue. He’s determined to clean up the streets, but has to do some dirt first, which lands him back in jail after he’s double-crossed by those he trusted.</p>
<p>This is straight-up criminology and the potential is off the charts if you have even the slightest shred of hope that Ghost could regain his gifts for plot twists, jaw-dropping detail, and character sketches that resulted in the most vivid storytelling hip-hop has ever witnessed. But that Ghostface disappeared nearly a decade ago. As such, there was no reason to say ""spoiler alert"" for any of the above. For one thing, it will be mentioned in every single review of<i> 36 Seasons</i>, because the entire story is laid out in a four-panel comic included in the CD’s insert. <i>All of it</i>.</p>
<p>And <i>36 Seasons</i> is more in line with the spirit of Ghostface’s recent output, where he’s more prolific and ""for the love"" than ever and somehow lazier at the same time. His lyrics barely deviate from the plot points laid in a comic book that can be read in 20 seconds, reverting to <i>Twelve Reasons</i>’ childlike literalism and chronology. The first line is, ""Ayo, I’m back after nine years/ That’s 36 seasons/ Shit is changed up for all types of reasons"" and from there on out, potentially graphic scenes are often similarly reduced to, ""this happened and then this happened.""</p>
<p>How has shit changed and what are these reasons? We’re told that the streets are being overrun with petty thieves and drug dealers, but also that Ghostface’s exile was likely the result of a bid in <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/doc/html/about/locate-facilities.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Tombs</a>. So who are these kids? Are they like the Polo rubgy-stealing turncoat from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRdMcKyWnS0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""R.A.G.U.""</a> or the incompetent, petty drug dealer from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-qWho7FQ08"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Maxine""</a>? No, on ""The Dogs of War"" (not to be confused with the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3637-fishscale/"">Fishscale</a></i> highlight <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QY6C6cesc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dogs of War""</a>), they’re selling drugs in a way that Ghostface merely finds unacceptable for aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p>When he confronts his estranged lover Bamboo (played by Kandace Springs) on ""Love Don’t Live Here"", we don’t get the shocking invective of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPLOI0PFoF8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wildflower""</a>, the wounded alpha wolf cry of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXJRuhE1_h8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Never Be the Same Again""</a>, or a combination of the two as on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zUDcdH3OI4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Back Like That""</a>. It literally goes nowhere; Tony Starks arrives at Bamboo's house; she is surprised. She has moved on. He feels disrespected. He rhymes ""the crib"" with ""the kid"" twice in the same verse. It’s actually painful to hear him attempt to modulate his voice trying to muster some kind of emotion during this thing. Starks retells his betrayal (""Double Cross""), his lightbulb moment (""Pieces to the Puzzle""), and his murder plot (""Homicide"") in similarly unembellished terms and once the climactic shootout arrives, it’s presented as damn near an afterthought—""I’m filling funeral homes and graves/ It’s no surprise GFK the only one that survive."" And then he wins back Bamboo. The end.</p>
<p>Maybe the reference to his past work is unfair and <i>36 Seasons</i> should be taken at face value. But after you hear the story once, at face value, <i>36 Seasons</i> is a serviceable, New York soul-rap album that has limited replay value. The frequent absence of Ghostface might actually be the best thing going for it, as he’s consistently outdone by Kool G Rap and AZ; maybe their characters are more well-defined and maybe their relative lack of celebrity makes them more capable of merging with character. More accurately, they simply write better raps in 2014. Likewise, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5333-pharoahe-monch"">Pharoahe Monch</a> appears as ""Dr. X."" on ""Emergency Procedure"", and spits typical tongue-twisting linguistics about the periodic table. But once it’s done, you’re still left with a track about creating a gas mask, which is otherwise useless outside the context of<i> 36 Seasons</i>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the high points of<i> 36 Seasons</i> often seem unintentional—during the rising action of ""The Dogs of War"", Theodore Unit lackey Shawn Wigs offers, ""you know how we do, O.G. style, I'll dress up like the pizza man,"" which is hilarious because it’s Shawn Wigs. Likewise, the undercurrent of New York City police corruption somehow makes <i>36 Seasons</i> uncomfortably prescient, especially when Ghostface complains of ""illegal chokeholds"" in a moment that feels way too hot to the touch right now. But the peak of <i>36 Seasons</i> comes during the outro of ""Homicide"", where Ghostface promises swift retribution and yells, ""I’ll wipe my dick on your spaghetti fork!"" Once you try to figure out what a spaghetti fork is and the astonishing insult of having someone do that to it, once that... <i>evocative</i> image fades, there’s a lingering sadness that it’s the first time you really hear Ghostface on <i>36 Seasons </i>instead of the increasingly mundane Tony Starks.</p></div>"|20052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20052-36-seasons/|6.0|Ian Cohen

He's partway into ""Tower of Song"", originally from 1988's <i>I'm Your Man</i>, where he plinks out a rudimentary keyboard solo over canned percussion, in between vocals about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"">Hank Williams</a> a hundred floors above him and being ""born with the gift of a golden voice."" He adds, ""If these are the crumbs of compassion that you offer to the elderly, I am grateful.""</p>
<p>If audiences have been humoring Cohen, who was 79 then and is 80 now, for his age, they've been doing it for decades; on ""Tower of Song"", he also admits to having an ""ache in the places where I used to play."" In fact, <i>Live in Dublin</i> is only the latest live album since Cohen returned to the road in 2008, having been swindled out of his savings by a manager. He previously released the closely similar CD/DVD collection <i>Live in London</i>, documenting a show from that first year of touring. And there was 2010's <i>Songs From the Road</i>, compiling a somewhat different set of songs from various 2008-2009 performances. Whether <i>Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979</i>, <i>Cohen Live </i>(drawing from 1988 and 1993 tours), or <i>Live at the Isle of Wight 1970</i>, live material from the supposedly not-so-golden-voiced songwriting giant is hardly lacking.</p>
<p>There's still plenty to recommend on <i>Live in Dublin—</i>in all earnestness, at that. For one, though <i>Live in London</i> has shipped more than 200,000 copies worldwide, odds are that for many who might like this package it will be their first live Cohen recording. Besides, compared with the already-magnificent <i>London</i> set it adds several songs that wound up on 2012 studio album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16228-leonard-cohen-old-ideas/""><i>Old Ideas</i></a>, making this a closer to exhaustive document of the perhaps no-longer-touring artist's legacy; though you'll probably get more replay value out of the audio component, the quality of the video—billed as Cohen's first to be shot in high-definition—is a noticeable improvement. Mostly, though, anyone curious about <i>Live in Dublin</i> might at least want to stream the audio or rent the video because, whatever similar releases came before, it's one monumental tower of a song.</p>
<p>Nothing here changes the foundations of Cohen's narrative, but as with any archetypal legend, it's made for retelling. The Jewish-Buddhist poet from Montreal whose songs are often best known through others' covers reminded crowds on his money-making tours that—despite a perhaps overstated reputation for aloofness (watch him doing standup comedy in 1965's <a href=""http://www.nfb.ca/film/ladies_and_gentlemen_mr_leonard_cohen/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen</i></a>)—he's a gifted and generous interpreter of his own work. His speak-singing style has grown deeper and gruffer, but not unbecomingly so, particularly amid so much use. His songs, as former backup singer Jennifer Warnes <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=p44Jtck3VCAC&amp;pg=PT294&amp;lpg=PT294&amp;dq=%22the+place+where+God+and+sex+and+literature+meet%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=38fpkeMM-Z&amp;sig=FS4NReXwOKw6O3aamxYs2p3FFFY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S2GGVNKGEoOyyATKtoHIDg&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20place%20where%20God%20and%20sex%20and%20literature%20meet%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">once told</a> the author of a 1994 Cohen biography, aim to reach ""the place where God and sex and literature meet,"" but his work since returning has had mostly just the artist's advancing years in common with death's-door albums such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>'s <i>Time Out of Mind</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Johnny Cash</a>'s (Cohen-covering) albums with Rick Rubin. He's still more of the darkly humorous standup comedian. Yes, he skips off stage.</p>
<p>For all the talk of literature that attaches itself to Cohen, it's striking when digesting his work at such great length how greatly he prizes the concept of song. His most famous composition, ""Hallelujah"", in a verse left out of the <i>Shrek</i>-immortalized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"">John Cale</a> (and thus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/494-jeff-buckley/"">Jeff Buckley</a>) versions but kept in here, envisions standing ""before the Lord of Song, with nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah""; toward the end of the Dublin encore, he refers to the joy of being ""united with you in the spirit of song."" Whether on 1967's ""Suzanne"", where ""you touched her perfect body"" (but only ""with your mind""), or 1974's ""Chelsea Hotel #2"", where ""we are ugly but we have the music,"" physical reality can be a flawed vessel for this spirit. On ""Anthem"", a song from 1992's <i>The Future</i> that featured on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6209-trent-reznor/"">Trent Reznor</a>'s <i>Natural Born Killers </i>soundtrack and precipitates Cohen's first traipse off the Dublin stage, he sings, ""Ring the bells that still can ring/ Forget your perfect offering/ There is a crack, a crack in everything/ That's how the light gets in."" Perfection is impossible, he explained around the time of song's release, noting that imperfection is ""where the resurrection is.""</p>
<p>Cohen's fatalism doesn't prevent him from at least striving toward perfection. Longtime collaborator Sharon Robinson, who sang backup during the recent shows along with English duo the Webb Sisters, in her new photograph book <a href=""http://www.randomhouse.com/book/242143/on-tour-with-leonard-cohen-by-sharon-robinson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>On Tour with Leonard Cohen</i></a> describes the concerts as a ""detailed snapshot"" of Cohen's life's work, ""meticulously put together"" and requiring ""a Zen-like focus."" The virtuosity of the backing band, which includes an additional six musicians along with the singers, is a further expression of Cohen's graciousness onstage. Despite the self-conscious artifice of ""Tower of Song"", the rest of the performances are based in rootsier music, whether American folk, rock, jazz, and blues or European traditions (Spanish guitarist Javier Mas also plays lesser-known instruments including the bandurria, the laud, and archilaud). Cohen's willingness to stretch his songs to their limits with instrumental and vocal solos means these concert recordings can't be as lean as 2002's <i>The Essential Leonard Cohen</i>—the Dublin set consists of 30 songs lasting about three hours, and the video portion adds three <i>Old Ideas</i> tunes performed in Canada—but in ringing the bells that still can ring, it's perhaps truer to Cohen's philosophy.</p>
<p>One more aspect setting <i>Live in London</i> apart from studio Cohen was his joyful interaction with the audience, and if anything that has intensified on <i>Dublin</i>. By the encore's opening ""So Long, Marianne"", he's eliding words in the chorus as if startled by the crowd's jubilant belting of the 1967 song; ""You sing so pretty,"" he says. And much as Cohen is willing to trust his songs to cover artists and to world-class bandmates, he also brings ""the spirit of song"" by closing the night with someone else's: ""Save the Last Dance for Me"", most famously recorded by the Drifters in 1960 (none other than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a> worked with Doc Pomus, who cowrote the song with Mort Shuman, and Reed has said the song was written on the day of the wheelchair-bound, polio-stricken Pomus's wedding, to a Broadway actress and dancer). By this point in the recording, my first time experiencing the concert, I was expecting something sublime, and that's what I got, though not in the way I expected: The stage lights shine on the audience members, who do much of the hook-singing work for Cohen. Forget your perfect offering.</p>
<p>Cohen is a genially commanding stage presence, falling on his knees at crucial moments and doffing his cap for his accompanists' solo turns. The <i>Old Ideas</i> songs, sprinkled throughout the set at just the right intervals, are naturally at home, capped with the wry God-speaking-to-a-man-named-Leonard ""Going Home"". Otherwise, the songs you know and plenty of songs you should know better are probably here. There's the apocalyptic <i>The Future</i> title track and the organ-drenched take on 1969's ""Bird on the Wire"", the smoldering Robinson co-write ""In My Secret Life"", off of 2001's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1527-ten-new-songs/""><i>Ten New Songs</i></a>, and same pair's bleak 1988 <i>I'm Your Man</i> collaboration ""Everybody Knows"" (used by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1822-guns-n-roses/"">Guns N' Roses</a> as  intro music on some <i>Use Your Illusions</i> shows). <i>I'm Your Man</i>'s disco-funk ""First We Take Manhattan"", covered by backup singer Warnes with Stevie Ray Vaughan as part of her influential 1987 tribute album <i>Famous Blue Raincoat</i>, runs right into a powerfully restrained take on <i>that </i>album's title track, originally from 1971's <i>Songs of Love and Hate</i> (""Sincerely, a friend,"" Cohen signs off this time).</p>
<p>Paradoxically, on the songs at greatest risk of overexposure, it's often the instrumental interludes, not Cohen's poetry, that make my hair stand on end, further justifying the songwriter's faith. This is especially the case for ""Hallelujah"", bringing to mind another less-covered lyric—one that underscores where Cohen differs from the trickster likes of Dylan: ""I've told the truth/ I didn't come to fool you."" For the last time, no, the good people of Dublin weren't humoring him. There might not be a single perfect, all-encompassing Cohen recording, but there's this. ""You can add up the parts/ But you won't have the sum,"" he sings on ""Anthem"", and despite his failed tax-avoidance retirement strategy, I'm inclined to trust the Zen priest in the bolo tie and fedora.</p></div>"|20051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20051-live-in-dublin/|8.0|Marc Hogan

Somewhere in his mind, he would love to have 30 hits""). There's a germ of an idea here that feels correct: oftentimes the artists who most shape the medium aren't necessarily meant to be stars. But the notion that an artist who fails to cross over was never meant to be truly successful begs the question, the flipside of a famous artist rationalizing their success after the fact. To read hip-hop's history in this way ignores the massive structural changes that have worked to obscure the genre's creative spine. The rapper's rappers, the genre's true innovators, are as often victims of the market's arbitrary whims as they are their own flaws.</p>
<p>The Jacka came out of one of hip-hop's most creatively vibrant regional scenes. One-fifth of the respected Pittsburgh, Calif. Mob Figaz crew, the group arose in the wake of Mac Dre's post-penal second wind, and were prepared to sign to his Thizz Entertainment label when the rapper was murdered in Kansas City in 2004. The Bay's hyphy movement followed, as national attention focused on the dry, manic production style of producers like Rick Rock, and the culture that surrounded it: the drugs and the dreads, ghostriding the whip and thizz faces. While national attention focused on hyphy's production novelty, street rap fans in a network of Bay-affiliated cities from the Pacific Northwest to Kansas City became obsessed with Jacka's potent skill with the pen—particularly with the release of 2005's classic <i>The Jack Artist</i>. The arc of his career—the moment when every verse he dropped felt like a vital piece of the puzzle—lasted about four or five years. But this year's <i>What Happened to the World</i> is his best record since 2009's <i>Tear Gas</i>, and suggests that whatever his potential for national stardom, the Jacka should be recognized as one of the last decade's strongest writers—both within and outside of hip-hop.</p>
<p><i>What Happened to the World</i> is a leisurely-paced record, moving at the speed of syrup. (The one exception, the uptempo ""MOB 4 Life"", is perhaps the record's only misfire). The production is of-a-piece and by and large Jacka still has a gift for a good chorus melody, but the heart of the album is in its star's lyrical performance. Jacka is a minimalist as a writer, an artist for whom saying a little implies a lot. Although those looking for club records or pop hits in the real-world sense might look elsewhere, Jacka still has an open, inclusive pop ear—this is accessible music which could easily appeal to a wide audience. Nonetheless, the album will most readily reach those who still value hip-hop as an art form of evocative lyricism. One of Jacka's strengths is a gift for potent and original imagery, as on ""2 Dungeons Deep"": ""Got the Wesson poppin' like meat in the pot fryin'/ Better have respect like the vet when he feed lions."" Even at his most brutal, he sidesteps cliché (""When the trigger squeeze we only leave bones, like a Lynx home,"" ""This Canon not for pictures but it still will make your center fold"") in the service of triggering powerfully rendered ideas.</p>
<p>For those just discovering the Jacka's work, it helps in some ways to think of him as the West Coast's answer to mixtape legend Max B: born within a year of each other, the two share similar influences (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10332-slick-rick/"">Slick Rick</a>'s melodic nonchalance seems an obvious common touchstone), and their sing-song choruses helped both become regional stars just as the old super-producer system began to break down. Their fundamental approach was both hip-hop and pop, and they reimagined New York's commercial golden era—roughly 1998-2003—for a new time or place. Where Max's style had the kind of implicit politics of music from the have-nots, Jack was more explicitly informed by both his identity as a Muslim and a tradition of the left coast's political radicals, particularly rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a>, Kam, and Paris. At the same time, there can be no question that his identity was first and foremost as a gangster rap artist, with all of its morally compromised implications. But it's what makes his approach so uniquely effective.</p>
<p>The bulk of Jacka's career feels like an attempt to reconcile principle and morality with a lifestyle that has made such stances untenable—on third song ""See It Thru"" (as throughout the record) he brings the contradictions together directly: ""Hard times, trying to be cool, I made the bed I slept.../ Ill whip come through the night, though I'm a piece of shit."" Rather than running from hip-hop's love of the fast life, of drugs, of materialism, he embraces their attraction. Criticisms of hip-hop's glorification of drugs and violence ignore that those things often glorify themselves; they are self-evidently appealing. One could argue Jack tries to have his cake and eat it too, but his fundamental realism one-ups hip-hop's typical righteous/ignorant dichotomy. ""On Methazine"", a record about promethazine addiction, manages to make the drug feel like a panacea for all that aches, physically and spiritually, but ends with these words: ""Tell myself I'll put away the cup when the summer's gone/ Shit ridiculous, finna be Christmas and we still ain't done,"" spiraling into the sample's numb warmth, before shifting to the chorus: ""Fuck with me, let's talk some more, 'cause I know everything/ But it's hard to notice when I'm leaned on Methazine.""</p>
<p>Through the loose sketches of his sparse verses, the album is more than an attempt to reconcile good and evil within; it also refuses to let the outside world off the hook. In attacking his own moral failings, it gives strength to his assault on a wider system. (""Weed Farmer"" is perhaps the closest a pro-pot record has come to ""Nature of the Threat"" in rap history.) Husalah's final verse to close the record has a dark poetic charge: ""False hope tossed the rope around them tree limbs/ Horrific strange fruit hang from loops in deep Southern winds."" But the album is more than its political content, too: it's a personal statement of vitality from an artist now in his 30s, who may be removed from the travails of his youth but still wrestles with their consequences. ""We hit the club, takin' pictures bitches stalkin the kid/ I had the time of my life, I'll never be young again/ But now I only think money 'cuz I'm finally a man.""</p></div>"|20045.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20045-what-happened-to-the-world/|8.0|David Drake

In the slow, low and loud domain that Usnea entered in 2011, songs that take up complete sides of vinyl are <i>de rigueur</i>. <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/label/news/yob-reveal-clearing-the-path-to-ascend-vinyl-pre-orders.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anything more</a> than a<a href=""http://www.relapse.com/label/news/yob-reveal-clearing-the-path-to-ascend-vinyl-pre-orders.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a>two-track, two-side release can start <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Ocean-Pantheon-Of-The-Lesser/release/2408653"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to feel like a textbook</a>—and cost the same, too.</p>
<p>When <a href=""http://www.orcawolf.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Orca Wolf</a>, a small and excellent hometown label, <a href=""http://orcawolf.storenvy.com/products/931461-usnea-s-t-lp-orca-wolf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">issued Usnea’s self-titled debut</a> early last year, that one-record treatment seemed to be the best they could offer. They put the marching-then-sprawling ""Chaoskampf"" on one side and the 17-minute grim gaze of ""Brazen Bull of Phalaris"" on the flip. That was only half of the story, however. <i>Usnea </i>included a download card that contained two ""bonus tracks,"" <a href=""http://usneadoom.bandcamp.com/album/usnea"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">or the last 25 minutes of the proper record. </a>Those alternately arching and thrashing tunes even bested what had been pressed to vinyl; taken together, the four tracks represented Usnea’s auspicious entrée in a teeming field. Their funereal lurch allowed both space and time for bits of black metal and death metal, plus psychedelic guitar solos that stretched and smeared into space rock. It was the sort of massive record you wanted to hold with both hands.</p>
<p>Usnea do not err on the side of cautious thrift for <i>Random Cosmic Violence</i>, their second LP and first for Relapse. This four-song, four-side set runs for one very loud hour, with blanketing distortion locked in perpetual battle against a rhythm section that rattles the room for attention. Guitarist Justin Cory and bassist Joel Williams volley vocals back and forth, the former’s serpent-tongue screams contrasting the latter’s bottom-feeder, doom-or-death bellow. The approach is, at times, invigorating. Cory’s historical tirade at the start of ""Healing Through Death""—""Paracelsus, doused in blood  on a night clear,"" he shouts in a caustic tone—leads you like a magnet toward the crunch of drums and guitars that follow. Near its end, opener ""Lying in Ruin"" winds into a noisy comedown, sheets of mutated tones covering and then crawling beneath a militaristic beat. You might wish it stretched ahead forever. And after moving through a beautifully ominous prelude, closer ""Detritus"" rises into a graceful, glacial procession. The quartet gradually piles on the layers, lacing feedback around the distortion and letting the dual guitars drift through complementary pirouettes. Toward song’s end, Cory and Williams trade quick lines about despair and hell and endings. Topical considerations aside, it’s a triumphant moment, an apex where the two singers summon and funnel the band’s collective power, pulling from the bottom and pushing through the top. It’s as moving as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4719-yob/"">YOB</a>, as forceful and loaded as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30524-evoken/"">Evoken</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s also the record’s lone vital stretch. Usnea’s small step toward heavy metal’s upper echelon seems to have cost the quartet more than recoupable pressing-plant expenses. As if frightened by Relapse’s legitimacy, Usnea have trimmed and codified their sound, cutting back on the excitability and adventurousness that made their debut so thrilling. Much of the motion from that first album seems to have shifted to the back-and-forth vocals, a pattern that eventually falls into a flatline. Sure, the title track initially routes post-punk through a doom worldview, much as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29933-atriarch/"">Atriarch</a> did on their own excellent Relapse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19711-atriarch-an-unending-pathway/"">debut</a>. It then moves briefly into a black metal harangue and, later, an almost-silent comedown. But the net effect is of a long march that goes nowhere at all; the deviations seem somehow furtive now, as though Usnea are trying to hide their eccentricities from what is certain to be an expanded audience. This feeling presides through more than half of <i>Random Cosmic Violence</i>, a record that rarely twists or turns hard enough to climb from a pre-established stylistic rut.</p>
<p>On <i>Usnea</i>, the unexpected offered excitement, as the young quartet wedged strange ideas into the wide spaces of its long songs. But on <i>Random Cosmic Violence</i>, the expected starts to make you wish that <i>this</i> had been the two-side debut, not the four-side Relapse set that you can hold with two hands. Usnea’s leverage may have expanded, but on album two, their music has not.</p></div>"|20023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20023-random-cosmic-violence/|6.8|Grayson Haver Currin

But with member names like Cloudface, Bluntman Deejay, and Hashman Deejay, I’m going to jump to the conclusion that there’s a fair amount of cannabinoids wafting around the geodesic dome that signifies said ""hut."" But even if Canada’s lax cannabis laws play no part in the creation of Mood Hut’s music, the tracks themselves suggest ease and haziness, a dilated sense of space and suspension of time. Most of the label’s mixes (released on cassette in small batches) and vinyl singles wander to expansive lengths and unfurl in no hurry, with a predilection for vibe above all else.</p>
<p>It makes sense that Washington D.C.’s <a href=""http://www.futuretimes.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future Times</a> label released a single earlier this year from Tanner Matt (aka Ttam Renat and Hashman Deejay) and now follows it up with the full-length <i>Sandopolis</i>, as his aesthetic most closely aligns with their own. His productions can be propulsive while also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14898-loving-the-drift/"">loving the drift</a> (to use a track title from FT’s boss Andrew Field-Pickering), at once shimmering and tough. Nearly 10 minutes in length, ""Xssential-3"" opens the album in exhilarating fashion, its Model 500 pacing lightened by flanged hi-hats. New layers of keys reveal subtle nuances as the track keeps going and there’s an echoing ripple that warps all of the elements, bringing to mind the psychedelic house tracks that the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"">Orb</a> made beyond the <i>Ultraworld</i>.</p>
<p>Matt then embraces early '90s R&amp;B and house with its swinging drums on ""Statues PF"", which seems destined at any moment to turn into a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuuatjHGnY&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lisa Stansfield dub</a>, a soft chord slowly filling up more of the space. ""Mercury"" opens with Milky Way ambience, atmospheric radio interference, and bleeps before a sinewy bassline and a tough 124 BPM beat kicks in. The back half of the album feels more exploratory and lush, a side long track called ""Mozaic"" being Mood Hut par excellence, a hybrid of New Age wooziness and body-moving house.</p>
<p>Mood Hut’s output this year has been matchless, each successive single suggesting that their aesthetic is ever so slowly becoming coherent. It was capped by Jack J’s ""Looking Forward to You"", a sumptuous three-tracker that shows a nexus of chillwave, dusty Detroit vibes and Al B. Sure!’s ""Nite and Day"". Recently fellow Hut member Cloudface dropped an untitled seven-track album on Black Opal, an offshoot of <a href=""http://opaltapes.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Opal Tapes</a>, that at its finest moments suggested the pensive melodicism of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> and the open-ended beats of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"">Theo Parrish</a>.

Blige appeared on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53686-watch-disclosure-and-mary-j-blige-share-new-version-of-f-for-you/"">remix</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a>’s ""F For You""—an unexpected but instantly natural pairing that at the time seemed merely like a coronation of sorts for the legendary R&amp;B singer. Instead it was a harbinger for both the individuals involved and the scenes they represent. As 2014 played out, the Lawrence brothers would see their breakthrough hit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14188-latch-ft-sam-smith/"">""Latch""</a> become a surprise staple on rap and R&amp;B radio stations, while Blige used her turn on ""F For You"" as the launching pad for a complete career digression—if not an overall reinvention.</p>
<p>Her new album <i>The</i> <i>London Sessions</i> features primary collaborations with Disclosure as well as fellow British pop superstars <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">Sam Smith</a>, Naughty Boy and ""Latch"" songwriter Jimmy Napes. That it stands as one of the final major releases of the calendar year is fitting as a summation of R&amp;B in 2014. As the sound of pop mutated into dance music a few years back, R&amp;B lost its footing in the American mainstream, leaving even its established superstars in the lurch. But R&amp;B clawed back some of its relevance this year thanks to danceable, appealing songs that didn’t immolate the genre at the altar of pop radio. Chris Brown’s ""Loyal"", for instance, was a massive hit, but more instructive in the context of Blige’s new album were Kid Ink’s ""Show Me"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a>’s ""Don’t Tell 'Em"", two hugely popular <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a>-produced songs that showed a younger generation how R&amp;B could fuse with house beats in a way that feels completely natural.</p>
<p>All of this—from Mustard’s wizardry to R&amp;B playlists finding room for ""Latch"" and Smith’s ""Stay With Me""—has helped provide a soft landing spot for Blige, whose career has been floating aimlessly for a few years now. Blige is nothing less than a titan of R&amp;B music, but she had fallen into a trap familiar to many popular musicians two decades into a career: by trying to cling to the zeitgeist she was making music that felt stale. Blige’s albums since 2007’s <i>Growing Pains</i> have been patchy, and she hasn’t had a true hit single since that album’s ""Just Fine"".</p>
<p>No single from <i>The London Sessions</i> has yet changed that latter issue, but as an album it certainly doesn’t feel stale. Instead, it’s a seamless and occasionally thrilling listen that establishes a fact many could have predicted: Blige’s throaty vocals, as passionate and emotional as ever, are an ideal fit for house music. Nonetheless the album doesn’t exactly play out how you might expect.</p>
<p>For instance, it opens with a quartet of ballads, only one of which—a classic Blige self-help anthem called ""Doubt"", co-written with Naughty Boy collaborator Sam Romans—rises to the level of the album’s better, later songs. Despite Blige stoking the album’s narrative with its name and by listing six songwriters on its cover, we are eased into the album slowly, as if we are wading into cold water. It’s like Blige couldn’t bear for her core fanbase to immediately hear a four-on-the-floor beat. The real meat of the album comes after these opening tracks—the album opens with a few wobbly steps, making the sequencing curious at best.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of the big name collaborators. Disclosure and Sam Smith are the starry names here peeking out from behind the curtains, though they even get their moments in the spotlight in the form of spoken word interludes in which they gush openly about Blige. The thing is that, although these three might have been the inspiration for <i>The London Sessions</i>, their contributions don’t exactly stand out.</p>
<p>""Right Now"", a Disclosure production with a Smith co-writing credit that was the first song released off the album, is not only one of the album’s most forgettable tracks, but it’s also so bland that it seems like Disclosure and Smith (along with Napes) were almost afraid to disturb Blige. Their reverence is clear in the clipped interludes—""To me she was this untouchable goddess,"" Smith says in one of them—but that too often translates to a sort of distance. ""Follow"", the other Disclosure track (though this time without Smith), is better, but with its simple skipping garage drums and rubbery bassline it still feels like a Disclosure starter kit.</p>
<p>The Lawrence brothers are actually shown up by a few old heads. The album’s best track is ""My Loving"", which was produced and co-written along with Blige and Romans by R&amp;B god Rodney ""Darkchild"" Jerkins. The track is a pure '90s house throwback, and it’s the first song on the album that really seems to electrify Blige. ""I’m in heaven, every time you lay your body next to me,"" she sings early in the track, letting her vocals run just slightly. Blige is channeling dozens of great, and often anonymous, house divas here, and naturally she fits in their lineage perfectly.</p>
<p>That song kicks off a run of tracks that really stabilizes the album. ""Long Hard Look"", which sounds like a take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31502-sampha/"">Sampha</a>’s broken keyboard confessionals, is the album’s best slow number. It’s followed up by ""Whole Damn Year"", another vintage Blige ballad that features quietly arresting vocals: ""It took a whole damn year to repair my body/ It’s been about five years."" Following that is the second instance in which the young kids get taught old tricks: ""Nobody But You"", the album’s second-best uptempo track, allows Blige to really belt a devotional house chorus, and she delivers. It was produced by UK garage forefather MJ Cole, who shows Disclosure how to stay out of Blige’s way with some clicking drums and piano chords while still giving her a song she can really sink her teeth into.</p>
<p>The album ends with another ballad, one that suspends Blige’s voice over pounding, chunky piano chords and a blush of strings. It is a final reminder that even if the surroundings change, Blige can wring emotion out of her voice like very few people on Earth. That, 20-something years on, she found a new way of showcasing this is why she is who she is.</p></div>"|20050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20050-the-london-sessions/|7.0|Jordan Sargent

The Elder Oscar Saunders testifies to the mighty love of Jesus, who ""bought me with His own blood,"" while the congregation interjects passages from hymns like ""Jesus Is Mine"" and ""I Sing Because I’m Happy"". It’s a rambunctious round of music, as though each element—the preaching and the singing—was trying to outpraise the other. Midway through the sermon, a female voice rises up to lead the congregation in a few lines of a different song: ""What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and deeds to bear/ What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!"" Almost as soon as you have identified the song—""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"", a 19th-century hymn penned by Joseph Scriven as a gift for his mother—the voices pivot fluidly into the next song, leaving you with that singular gospel idea: faith as an unburdening of woes.</p>
<p>Having grown up in a Southern Baptist church in rural West Tennessee, I’ve sung ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"" more times than I can remember, but I’ve never heard it quite like this. I recall a more staid version from the bright green hymnals in the pews of our sanctuary, a somber sing-along with rough harmonies yet a sense of communal reassurance. It was always set to the same tempo at which every other hymn was paced, but singing together with 200 other congregants instilled a sense of churchly unity; you were part of a larger group bound together in song. Yet, on ""Preaching With Singing"" the melody of ""What a Friend"" is bouncier and more urgent than I could have ever imagined, the sentiment more vivid as that female voice (which remains, sadly, uncredited and most likely lost to history) soars above the congregation. Its spiritedness makes you want to believe in such a higher animating power, which may be gospel’s great musical achievement. Even nonbelievers can listen to this music and understand the bone-deep thrill of faith.</p>
<p><i>When I Reach That Heavenly Shore: Unearthly Black Gospel, 1926-1936</i>, compiled by the notorious 78 collector Christopher King and released by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=tompkins+square"">Tompkins Square</a>, collects 42 tracks similar and dissimilar to ""Preaching With Singing"". They come from a variety of sources and locales, but the defining aspect of this compilation may be the era it represents. These songs predate the commercial heyday of gospel in the 1940s, depicting instead a time when radio was broadcasting this music to new audiences and when many of the elements that would define the genre were only just being set in stone. For that reason, <i>When I Reach That Heavenly Shore</i> offers a glimpse of gospel’s early calls and responses, its first hallelujahs and amens. ""This gift of extemporaneous expression is at the heart of the recordings contained in this modest collection,” King writes in the liners. ""The variety of regional approaches to sacred song in this collection—shape-note hymnody, verse ‘lining,’ unbridled ecstasy, and plaintive mourning—are all informed by the then recent experience of slavery and by the then current state of Jim Crow.""</p>
<p>Gospel would become the soundtrack to the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, with hymns like ""We Shall Overcome"" and ""This Little Light of Mine"" lending a moral dimension to the cause of equal rights. Especially on such numbers as the Jubilee Gospel Team’s ""Stations Will Be Changed"" and Blind Joe &amp; Emma Taggart’s ""I’ll Be Satisfied"", there is a sense of earthly striving, as though there is little difference between social and spiritual struggles. As Edward W. Clayborn, self-billed as ""The Guitar Evangelist,"" rips through ""I Shall Not Be Moved"", he hints at the significance the song would later obtain, as the fluidity of his picking signifies an excitement over the heavenly promise that the wrongs of this world will be made right in the next. Listening to these songs in 2014—a year when the violent loss of black lives has gone bafflingly unprosecuted—is a powerful experience: glorious because this music can speak to us across nearly a century, tragic because these fears are still relevant and unresolved after so much time.</p>
<p>As King states in his liner notes, <i>When I Reach That Heavenly Shore</i> displays the breadth of gospel styles in pre-WWII America, from the intense sermonizing of Rev. A. W. Nix to the rural acoustic blues of Mother McCollum. The differences between these styles are often obvious, even if King provides no background on any particular track or performer. There are copious Bible verses to bolster the songs’ spiritual messages, but there is little sense of who these people were, what circumstances shaped their craft, or what their larger contributions to music or ministry might have been. Anything to settle and contextualize their tracks or to humanize these artists would be helpful, even just a broad discussion of trends in gospel during this particular era.</p>
<p>One of the precepts of gospel music, of course, is a certain earthly anonymity: These congregations and ministers sing not to distinguish themselves, but to glorify God. In this case, the ""Unearthly"" in the subtitle makes a bit of sense, even if it reads as weirdly mystifying and potentially erases the accomplishments of these artists. Previous Tompkins Square gospel comps have employed similarly evocative, albeit highly questionable adjectives, like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15861-this-may-be-my-last-time-singing/"">raw</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13759-fire-in-my-bones-raw-rare-otherworldly-african-american-gospel-1944-2007/"">otherworldly</a>."" (Using ""other"" in this context is extremely problematic, as it relegates African American experience even further to the margins of what is considered the norm.) And there is nothing unearthly about Rev. Emmet Dickinson’s ""What the Men Wanted the Women Was Sitting On"", a sermon that balances the sexual trickery of women with the lustful idiocy of men, or Rev. J.M. Gates’ ""Dead Cat on the Line"", which unspools one of the weirdest metaphors imaginable for our lack of communion with God. These are earthly messages, grounded in everyday experience and nearly convinced that man is unworthy of redemption. </p>
<p>That word ""unearthly"" resonates uncomfortably throughout, as excusing the absence of historical materials. It dislocates the artistic accomplishment from the mouths of the artists and assigns it to some vague ether between Heaven and Earth. That may seem largely academic, as it barely affects the immediate enjoyment of the songs collected on <i>When I Reach That Heavenly Shore</i>. But gospel is ultimately a music that thrives on empathy—singers communicating spiritual ecstasy to Christians and non-Christians alike. If these songs can stir a spiritual desire even in the nonbeliever, then it also ignites a desire to know more about the people recording these incredible professions of faith.</p></div>"|19976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19976-when-i-reach-that-heavenly-shore-unearthly-black-gospel-1926-1936/|7.7|Stephen M.

On each of their last two records, the Irish metal stalwarts lurched into motion, as though priming the engine of some great old machine. <i>To the Nameless Dead</i>, from 2007, reached its racing, blackened beat after a distended prelude of electric guitar haze. Four years later, <i>Redemption at the Puritan’s Hand</i> wove through militaristic field recordings, meandering acoustic guitar, and galloping war drums for two minutes before ripping into its melee.</p>
<p>The time for hesitation, however, has ostensibly passed. <i>Where Greater Men Have Fallen</i>, the band’s excellent eighth album, begins with a very big boom. The drums open with a heavy hit, followed by a jagged-edged riff and a countering lead that’s pulled as taut as a high wire. And when frontman Alan Averill, or A.A. Nemtheanga, screams ""Go,"" the beat only intensifies, with the guitars flexing extra muscle, too. In the time it’s recently taken Primordial to get into a song, Averill—one of the most captivating bandleaders in metal—is already screaming tales of pillaging armies, buried children, and massed graves. For a band that’s always paid so much attention to the end of empires and lives, the pressure of their own creeping morality seems to have induced added urgency.</p>
<p>Primordial have already flirted with their own demise: In 2010, after an onstage meltdown in Greece, <a href=""http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/748/19481/Primordial-apologizes-for-drummer.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Averill publicly apologized</a> for the actions of drummer Simon O’Laoghaire and admitted that Primordial sought an immediate replacement. ""Over the last 10 years, we have had many problems with Simon’s alcohol and substance problems,"" he wrote. ""We have tried many, many times to help him out, but on Saturday things reached a new low."" But the quintet persevered and summarily recorded the death-conquering record <i>Redemption</i>.</p>
<p>The survivor symptoms seem more prominent, however, on <i>Where Greater Men Have Fallen</i>, an eight-song set that finds Primordial more focused—but just as fierce—as ever. Primordial’s discography is a stylistic field trip. They have ventured between straight black metal homage and heavy metal heroics, but they have specialized in a mix of the two, laced with idyll accents, acoustic instruments, and the recognizable melodies of Celtic folk. There’s neither space nor time for that here. ""The Seed of Tyrants"" heads straight into a black metal ascent, the band easing the tension between the rhythm and riff only to pull it tight again. The song ends much where it starts, redirecting only for a brief mid-tempo midsection that serves to emphasize the ferric strength of its furious conclusion. ""Babel’s Tower"" locks quickly into a lumbering doom groove. Averill uses the pulpit to croon and cry his prophecy of the world’s end. At various points, the song jumps into double-time and half-time, but both instances swivel around the same languid riff-and-rhythm pair. Compared to Primordial’s past successes, the stripped-and-centered approach might seem simplistic, but the hour-long result is more immediate because of it. From beginning to end, <i>Fallen</i> feels like a compulsory listen.</p>
<p>Late-album highlight ""Born to Night"" does make time for a long and gentle introduction, but the magnetic tune that eventually emerges bears the theatrics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden/"">Iron Maiden</a> and the twisting maneuvers of Confessor. What’s more, every turn of Averill’s voice here feels like a plea from some hardened soul singer, begging you to follow him into his battle. That’s an essential element of <i>Fallen</i>’s appeal; though Averill has been one of the most capable singers in metal for two decades, he has tapped into a new potency, delivering these tales of loss in search of redemption like Mahalia Jackson looking for her Lord. It’s surprising that, a quarter-century into Primordial, Averill is now perhaps better than ever. His performance during ""Come the Flood"", for instance, is electrifying. He leaps between falsetto crests and bellowed lows during the first verse, broods and commands through the chorus, and vamps with gusto in the turnarounds like he’s the son of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32403-robert-plant/"">Robert Plant</a>. On these eight tracks, Averill is in total control and absolutely thrilling for it. </p>
<p>But none of this is to say that, just because Primordial omitted some acoustic accessories and upped the rock spectacles, they’ve turned away from their Irish pedigree, always such an essential part of the music they’ve made. Rather, the opening title track swivels around a chorus to which you might lift a pint in a pub, its sing-along swagger reinforced by shouted harmonies and guitars that aim upward. More important, though, is the way Averill questions his nationality, pride, and sense of belonging in these lyrics. There is an incensed resignation at work here, <a href=""http://www.primordialweb.com/archive/messages/2010-01.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a feeling that Ireland is only another territory that forsook some of its own early virtues. </a>""This dreadful history we have sired,"" Averill offers, ""is the black, bleached future that you have desired."" <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2010/10/interview-a-a-nemtheanga-primordial/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">That suspicion exists outside of Ireland</a>, of course, and resonates across the Atlantic right now in particularly shameful ways. It’s the right time for Primordial to push pause on their nationalist isolation—not only for their respective age, but also for our collective one.</p></div>"|19908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19908-where-greater-men-have-fallen/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

Before last year, Mr. Mitch would have been considered a surprise source for that kind of work. The <a href=""http://gobstopper-records.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gobstopper Records</a> founder and London DJ was a monster out the gate, with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B9Mcs98Y8g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-titled 2010 debut EP</a> and 2012 beat-battle showstopper <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obrpIuL7Xow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Senior Bass""</a> standing as early-career trophies for the producer; his ability to bump the heavy shit but shun cold-concrete aggression for bright, alcopop-buzzed hyperactivity was what made him exciting. Even when he went a little overcast, he did so playfully—for proof, check out the ODB-looping <i>Grime 2.0</i> highlight <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b2Mp4IYwck"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Viking""</a> and its tipsy, bottom-heavy synthesizer whistle. It's as potent with ""Funky Worm"" squiggle-synths as classic g-funk was.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That's why <i>Parallel Memories</i> is surprising. Just a year ago, Mitch was bumping trap-drenched, hip-hop-adjacent bass-war artillery <a href=""http://www.beatport.com/release/suave/1149239"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like the Suave EP</a>. But he also made a point of countering last year's agressive, grime-producer soundclash ""war dubs"" free-for-all with his own simmered-down <a href=""http://mrmitch.bandcamp.com/album/peace-dubs-vol-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Peace Edits""</a>. Now he's breaking out with a full-length record that's more restrained, more skeletal, and often more mournful than anything he's done before, a metamorphosis from somebody who's had fans growing to expect them on the regular. And he so regularly nails that transformative take on grime that it's tempting to assign the things he does here as a new potential signature sound. At the minimum, it gives him a new tool in his kit.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The wide-open hushed silences and swooning interplay between synth hooks and pared-down beats puts </span><i>Parallel Memories </i><span>in the neighborhood of something that could be called ""ambient grime"" if that weren't a little too pat. But the slow-burning loops, distance-making reverb, and glassy digital melodies are made to envelop, not built to destroy. The first kick on the album doesn't show up until nearly two and a half minutes into opener ""Afternoon After"", and when it does finally thump its way through warped-Minimoog swells that chirp like the offspring of harps and whistles, it sounds like a bomb being dropped. That's just one bracing use of negative space, and in a track more suited to scene-setting; in the cuts with more of a focus on rhythm—as busy as the plastic clatter of ""Intense Faces"" or as screwed-down as the deep-snow trudge of ""Hot Air""—the sawed-off beats hit harder for the air around them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But what's remarkable is how many different moods Mitch is able to evoke this way. Take ""Don't Leave"": it's simple—and staggeringly effective—to draw off the power of a sampled hook like he does with Blackstreet's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBUz2nkOKsc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Leave Me""</a>, pitting virtuoso R&amp;B vocal intensity alongside delicate, wandering, halting digital melodies that create deep tension with two different strains of slow-motion heartache. But the calm that masks tension also sweetens harshness, like the way the subtly martial snap-thump stutter-step beats of ""Intense Faces"" shed their gloom the moment he brings in its plinky keyboard counterpoint. And even inside those juxtapositions, there are different shades and detours that provoke mood swings through each loop. ""The Night"" is frayed nerves or lucid relaxation depending on the angle, a recurring indistinct voice repeating the same two syllables that could either be calling somebody's name or waving them goodbye. ""Bullion"" plays out like a electro banger slowed to a crawl because the gears are gummed up, and draws out an odd, ill-at-ease feel of triumphant queasiness in the process. And ""Sweet Boy Code"", a Peace Edit of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hrv8nYL454w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Dark0's ""Sweet Boy Pose""</span></a>, maintains the original's fast-forward euphoria even at half-speed, floating through frozen time with a lightheaded clarity. There's plenty of room for interpretation in the margins of this music—but there's even more room to breathe, and to move.</p></div>"|20001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20001-parallel-memories/|7.9|Nate Patrin

Because of course he did. The metaphor almost seems too groaningly obvious to be true: If he wasn't going to be patiently trimming shapes out of vast space in one medium, it seemed, another one would have to do.</p>
<p>More than any other subgenre, New Age is concerned with space, about placing sounds like immaculately arranged furniture in a white room. <i>Gymnosphere</i>, in that regard, was rather unwieldy—at least as a physical retail object. Spread across two LPs and occupying nearly 120 minutes, the album also came with De La Sierra's 20-page hand-drawn booklet to accompany it. ""Greetings to all fellow members and space colonizers here present in this our local universe,"" De La Sierra wrote in the liners' opening page, in a decorous Hallmark script. The music within he humbly offered as ""spatial food... for our finer being bodies"" along with his instructions that portions of it be specifically listened to ""at the nexus in the diurnal-nocturnal cycle"" (presumably, he meant ""twilight""). It was, in every way, a big object with no space to fit into: Unity Records, which had the misfortune of releasing New Age records before anyone had figured out how to sell New Age records, eventually went under, just a few minutes on the cosmic calendar before Enya and Yanni turned New Age into an industry.</p>
<p>Now <a href=""http://www.numerogroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Numero Group</a> has reissued De La Sierra's <i>Gymnosphere</i> in its original length and with De La Sierra's original drawings lovingly intact. It's a remarkable turnabout for an album that was lost in the digital wilderness for decades. Finding information on the Internet about De La Sierra that predates last year is rough, usually turning only a few tremulous queries for this <a href=""http://www.hypnos.com/smf/index.php?topic=5023.0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""orphaned work""</a> to find a new home. But recently, as labels reissue more material from the period, there has been an unusual amount of energy and attention devoted to the pre-boom New Age years. A few years ago, the thought of hardcore music kids aggressively seeking out long-lost New Age documents by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19024-laraaji-nadananda/"">Laraaji</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31452-iasos/"">Iasos</a>, and Constance Demby would have seemed like a gentle joke, but now it just feels like the inevitable next step in the acceleration of reissue culture.</p>
<p>Narrating music without any legible action is a bit if a riddle, but a salient measure of New Age is how lightly it inspires intangible feelings like melancholy and contemplation without alerting your higher mind that you're being ""bored."" De La Sierra's piano, recorded live in Grace Cathedral in 1977,  is an elusive sound, at once tactile and abstract. On the one hand, it's clearly a piano ringing out into a drafty cathedral, muffled by room tone and tape recording, and occasionally you can feel the stale breeze from the chapel pews on your face. On the other, his glimmering tone feels like a trick of the light, something that catches your attention and then promptly disappears. His lightly dancing playing, spelling out one or two chords for uninterrupted minutes at a time, turns notes into vague shapes of the kind you see when you press on your closed eyelids.</p>
<p><i>Gymnospher</i>e consists of four separate pieces—""Music for Gymnastics"", ""Temple of Aesthetic Action"", ""Music for Devotional Past"", and ""Sphere of Sublime Dances"". Each runs over 20 minutes, the space between them little more than a breath for silence and composure. ""Music for Gymnastics"" consists mostly of one chord, spelled out in the left hand again and again while the right hand dances over runs. The chords don't change, in any active sense, as much as they cloud into new harmonies, touch on suggestions of new chords. It's like watching sediment stir and settle in your tea—contemplative, mundane, somehow, on a tiny level, awe-inspiring.</p></div>"|19994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19994-gymnosphere-song-of-the-rose/|7.5|Jayson Greene

Meanwhile, </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10409-zeitgeist/"">Zeitgeist</a></i><span> and </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16742-oceania/"">Oceania</a></i><span> each attempted to signify a workmanlike, “back to basics” approach for a band who never did workmanlike or basic. The whine was there, the riffs too, but that was about it. Corgan had been trying to trigger nostalgia for a version of his band that didn’t exist, so <i>Monuments to an Elegy</i> turns out to be his first savvy artistic move in nearly 15 years: a Smashing Pumpkins album that has no precedent whatsoever in his catalog.</span></p>
<p>For one thing, it is 33 minutes long. We're not talking about a mid-album triptych named after Greek goddesses or a bonus compilation available only if you preordered <i>Monuments</i> on iTunes—like, <i>the whole thing</i> is barely more than a half hour. And it’s split almost equally amongst nine songs of concise, gleaming alt-rock that leaves the album title as the only remnant of Corgan’s excessive tastes. Just a few months ago, it wasn’t particularly clear why Corgan would serve as an executive producer for sync-core opportunists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30956-ex-cops"">Ex Cops</a>. In retrospect, it may have been method acting, or at least a fact-finding mission to determine how the Pumpkins could sound modern without being desperate for relevancy.</p>
<p>As a result, Corgan isn’t chasing dead formats or trying to fit into playlists at radio stations that consider “Today” to be classic rock. He simply does what most de facto “alt-rock” bands do in 2014—he tries to blend in, making Smashing Pumpkins songs that aren’t exactly aiming for spins in Target, H&amp;M, or car commercials but wouldn’t be out of place if those did come to pass.</p>
<p>But Corgan has always had a latent allergy to anything associated with “indie rock” and now that it’s basically synonymous with “alt-rock,” he still has to prove himself out of step by showing allegiance to his Stratocaster. There are synthesizers and drum machines all over <i>Monuments</i>, but they’re fringe: it’s a still a <i>guitar</i> album. However, he uses guitar as a tool rather than an instrument of expression as what were once riffs are now power chords, solos are whittled down to mere leads. As a result, the songs on <i>Monument</i> are SP concentrate, engineered for instant impact, vestigial songwriting parts around an uplifting chorus that could really be about anything. The lyrics are stupefyingly vague, but the songs about new love sound like they could just as easily be about lost love and vice versa, while the ones about staying true to yourself could be either.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Monuments</i> is the <i>easiest</i> Smashing Pumpkins album, even though it’s the first where Billy Corgan is willing to share a studio with someone more famous and egomaniacal than himself. Drummer Mike Byrne has been replaced by someone nearly 30 years his senior in Tommy Lee, best known as the frontman for the rap-metal latecomers <a href=""http://vimeo.com/55696420"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Methods of Mayhem</a> and skinsman for a popular hair metal concern. Corgan surely relishes the opportunity to once again rep for the most uncool iterations of metal, but the partnership is more likely a result of the weird friendships aging rock stars can form with other aging rock stars, i.e., the only people they can relate to. Lee’s excessive tastes are even more downplayed than Corgan’s here, as his impact is most Crüe-like on the funk-metal stomp “Anaïse!” It is also the worst song on the album.</p>
<p>But while I can’t run the numbers as to how many new fans were earned due to <i>Zeitgeist</i> and <i>Oceania</i>, it’s best to assume that <i>Monuments</i> will be no one’s introduction to Smashing Pumpkins—so it’s not worth pretending Billy Corgan can ever truly <i>blend in</i>. The album manages to neutralize the indelible vocals by evoking Corgan's lesser-known guises of the past—the mash-note writer from <i>Adore</i>, the PMA mouthpiece from Zwan, and the facile pop-rocker that was mostly relegated to the B-sides during the Pumpkins’ commercial heyday. The end result is what might have been a state-of-the-art record in 2005 that would’ve done wonders for his reputation had it replaced <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1810-the-future-embrace"">TheFutureEmbrace</a></i>.</p>
<p>For now, Corgan catches up with a decade in which his muse basically went missing. Opener “Tiberius” thumps at saturated power chords in waltz time while throwing things just off course with some extra time signature switches and sober piano. So now you’ve heard Smashing Pumpkins as a version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer"">Weezer</a> that fully embraced its late-2000s prog yen. Dear lord, is the title of “Being Beige” asking for it, especially when its crisp electro-acoustic layering and breathy vocals establish an unthinkable connection between <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18656-death-cab-for-cutie-transatlanticism"">Transtlanticism</a></i> and <i>Adore</i>. It’s also the best thing Corgan’s written since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLPgz9K4D20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Honestly”</a>, mirroring its choral surge and stilted, romantic wording. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think <i>Monuments to an Elegy</i> was a promising debut from a band that hasn’t found its focus yet and would sound just fine opening up for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4929-silversun-pickups/"">Silversun Pickups</a>.</p>
<p>But it’s the easiness of <i>Monuments</i> that truly make it an outlier—whether Corgan constructed a masterpiece or just sounded labored, it was obvious that a ton of effort went into Smashing Pumpkins. Once the bubbly “Anti-Hero” pops, there’s a relief in hearing the record end with Corgan having not fucked up for his longest stretch of time in two decades. But it’s ultimately nowhere near as rewarding as his best work because it took no risks. Surely, Corgan has an emotional investment in this, but he seems stuck with some of the best music in years and absolutely nothing to say about it. It’s probably too much to ask for him to go <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"">Mark Kozelek</a> and also start writing narrative songs about <a href=""http://www.pawschicago.org/120275/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his cats</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54534-amc-developing-tv-show-about-billy-corgans-pro-wrestling-league-resistance-pro/"">his interest in combat sports</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57622-smashing-pumpkins-sell-fuck-you-anderson-cooper-t-shirts-featuring-cats-in-bowties/"">his beef with media figures</a>. But a glance at the titles foreshadows the songs of <i>Monuments</i> as empty vessels, whether it’s phrases repeated in the hopes of giving them heft and meaning (“Run2me”, “One and All”) or placeholder names of people that Billy Corgan probably hasn’t met yet (“Anaïse!”, “Dorian”). As for sweet nothings like, “I’ve never been kissed by a girl like you before” or “cherry blossom, this is goodbye,” well, you can’t pretend it’s someone other than a 47-year old Billy Corgan singing them to you.</p>
<p>As with <i>Oceania</i>, “not bad” doesn’t translate to “great” and the easiest and perhaps only way to have an emotional investment in these songs is to consider what they mean to the Smashing Pumpkins brand. Which is why “Drum and Fife” is the most resonant thing here. As with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KE9lvU810"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Cherub Rock”</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWJYaep-0sg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Everlasting Gaze”</a>, it’s a strident rock song about Being Billy and Being OK With That. This is proudly anti-cool, with a Tommy Lee fill punctuating the line, “I will bang this drum to my dying day,” before an actual fife solo. He knows the hipsters never had his back anyway and in 2014, they are certainly not going to align for the big fight <i>to rock</i>, of all things. And he’s not trying to convince the doubters he’s not dead. When he sings, “you’re gonna listen now to me,” he’s only addressing those who have been following his beat the whole time.</p></div>"|20030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20030-monuments-to-an-elegy/|6.0|Ian Cohen

It's not a line you expect from a Christmas song—it’s not really a line you’d expect from <i>any </i>song about trying to win over a lover’s heart. But its silly Debbie Downer-tone bares some truth: Christmas is a holiday full of romantic promise, but it also has its sour side. This honesty comes courtesy of Los Campesinos!’s latest, a six-track EP of yuletide goodness (and sadness) that brings together three holiday singles the band has released over the past few years, along with two covers and a new track. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The Christmas songs are chock-full of holiday imagery: deer run rampant, life is lined with tinsel, and baby Jesus makes a few appearances. A band that has always favored texture, Los Campesinos! make these songs brassy and jangling in all the right places—their love affair with the glockenspiel is right at home. And throughout the record, the band conveys the typical holiday mix of Christmas emotions: sentimentalism, desperation, and loneliness. If <a href=""http://www.georgemichael.com/last-christmas-single-for-record-store-day-black-friday/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">George Michael</a> is giving his heart to someone special, lead singer and songwriter Gareth is bitterly trying to force his heart back upon whoever initially tossed it.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Sometimes the band tackles these feelings with a welcome smirk. ""A Doe to a Deer"", here in a shinier version than the one they released back in 2012, is a cheeky, dramatic proclamation of love, one that has Gareth shape-shifting into everything from annoying sleet to security footage of a drunk Santa at the mall. Then there’s the equally impassioned ""Kindle a Flame in Her Heart"", with a resilient Gareth greedily swallowing coal and begging to be swaddled in his lovers’ arms.</p>
<p class=""p1"">These holiday songs are neither sad-sack nor hyper-cheerful; they'd find good company next to the Waitresses’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SzjDOk_u9I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Christmas Wrapping""</a> or even the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"">Kinks</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni04_SF-HRQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Father Christmas""</a> in their mix of cynicism and traditional Christmas narrative. The holiday music landscape could stand to lose a few of the retro covers and pile on a little more bleakness and humor. Gareth’s songwriting has always excelled in the dark arts of self-deprecation and crucifying exes, and hearing it in this setting is like sitting next to a sarcastic teenage cousin at the Christmas dinner table—refreshing, albeit unconventional.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But even when Los Campesinos! aren’t getting overtly snarky, the melancholy woven throughout the album makes for beautiful Christmas music in a more familiar sense, from the soulful rendition of Mud’s ""Lonely This Christmas"" to ""The Trains Don’t Run (It’s Christmas Day)"". A folksy cover of the old British carol ""The Holly &amp; the Ivy"", which features Rob Taylor on vocals, sounds out of place on the album, but that's understandable given that it was once released on its own. As a standalone track, it’s gorgeous, but it’s also a testament to how well the Los Campesinos! angst works in this context.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Christmas can sometimes be an incubator for loneliness, magnifying the distance between families, friends, and partners. This is a holiday that makes people kiss if they’re caught standing <i>under a plant</i>; people really want romance to thrive. <i>A Los Campesinos! Christmas </i>is a record for those who want to spin a seasonal record that's both crushingly isolated and humorously self-aware.</p></div>"|20031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20031-a-los-campesinos-christmas-ep/|7.5|Hazel Cills

The group hasn’t been very active lately—the recordings that comprise <i>12</i> were all made in 2011—but they were also never a conventional band in the first place, meeting only to perform completely improvised pieces together and never discussing their music before or after playing it. Albums are named numerically in sequence, and the tracks are named the same way. If you follow Norway’s improvised music and avant garde scenes, you likely know the work of Helge Sten, who records on his own as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1210-deathprod/"">Deathprod</a> and has produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31232-jenny-heval/"">Jenny Hval</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2161-jaga-jazzist/"">Jaga Jazzist</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5260-arve-henriksen/"">Arve Henriksen</a>, who records as a solo artist and session musician, and Ståle Storløkken, who has played with Terje Rypdal among many others. In Supersilent, though, the three musicians work assiduously to efface their usual identities, collectively creating music that defies easy categorization.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>12</i>, their twelfth album as the title implies, is no exception. It is at times intensely beautiful, playing like a soundtrack to footage of the frozen surface of Europa, but more often exudes a creepy, ashen vibe, as if the mission to Europa had gone just slightly wrong, leaving no way for the survivors to escape an alien world. More aggressively abstract and unsettling than most of their previous work, it nevertheless has a compelling shape, leaving the ice fields of its outer thirds for a place no less strange but more active. Storløkken’s keyboards and Henriksen’s trumpet rise out of the churning textures to become recognizable for fleeting moments, and it becomes clear just how much of that foreboding texture that greets you at the beginning of the LP is trumpet, stretched and smeared to a point where it surrenders its identity and merges with the electronics.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Direct reference points for this music are hard to come by. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>’s most consciously out music, Iannis Xenakis’ <i>Metastaseis</i>, Ash Ra Tempel’s <i>Schwingungen</i>, Ligeti’s work with tone clusters, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>’s <i>Atem</i> all operate in similar sonic territory, but Supersilent arrive there from a completely different direction. Whether they’re focused on a cavernous, gravelly drone or subsuming a nascent melody under a scraping wall of electronics, the results are spellbinding and make for a unique entry in the band’s already deep discography.</p></div>"|20037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20037-supersilent-12/|7.8|Joe Tangari

It can appear as a well-placed bridge, or a godlike key change (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob7vObnFUJc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">or many</a>), or an impossible note belted at a song's climax that sends an involuntary chill down your spine. <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203646004577213010291701378"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Science says</a> it's hidden in an ornamental note called an <i>appoggiatura</i>, but for these purposes let's just call it auditory <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">umami</a></i>: that moment in a song that makes your feelings explode, whether you want them to or not. We hear it most often in populist genres, where songwriters compose specifically to hook the largest amount of people possible, and sometimes it's employed in bad faith (see: the Lumineers). But nowhere has it been more effective than in pop punk.</p>
<p>Brooklyn quartet Chumped is hot on the heels of this elusive sound. Their debut LP, <i>Teenage Retirement</i>, is no <i>A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar </i>(perhaps thankfully so), but it often finds that melodramatic sweet spot that made emo and pop punk hit so hard in the '90s and '00s. Synthesizing the aesthetic developed over the past few years by DIY pop-punk revivalists like Columbus's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31635-all-dogs/"">All Dogs</a> with the soaring instrumental prowess and energy of the old guard, <i>Teenage Retirement</i>,<i> </i>at its best, sounds like a new evolutionary stage of the genre. </p>
<p>Structurally, Chumped is working with a wide array of influences. There are times when their licks wax <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>esque, like on ""Hot 97 Summer Jam"" and ""Anywhere But Here"", and the cleverly titled ""Novella Ella Ella Eh"" is essentially <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR3Vdo5etCQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Speak""</a> on uppers. On ""Coffee"", bassist Doug McKeever takes the mic for a self-lacerating turn that could easily be mistaken for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30624-swearin/"">Swearin</a>'s Kyle Gilbride (see: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFhXVIxOldA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Crashing""</a>). And in several instances (""Long Division"") they channel <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18205-aye-nako-unleash-yourself/"">Aye Nako</a>'s measured confessional, spinning it upwards into a gloriously bitter bridge—""I hope wherever you end up it makes you happy/ And when you're ready come and find me I'll be waiting""—worthy of the great emo <i>umami</i> (<i>emami</i>?) gourmands, from Matchbook Romance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2195-jimmy-eat-world/"">Jimmy Eat World</a>. </p>
<p>The record does get caught in a few of the traps that separate the remembered from the forgotten in pop punk. Songs like ""Long Division"" and album opener ""December Is the Longest Month"" are handicapped by seemingly arbitrary melodies or half-heartedly structured verses; others sometimes spend half their length getting to their catchiest, tightest musical phrasings. At times, <i>Teenage Retirement</i> can feel like trying to scratch an itch millimeters beyond your grasp, because it's obvious Chumped knows what they're doing, or at least are 90 percent of the way there. Instrumentally, they succeed in spades, hitting angsty guitar-solo sweet spots again and again, the ones that make you shout, ""YES!"" in your car, punching the gas as you're speeding down the highway. </p>
<p>The grown-up punks walk the line between the immature self-obsession that drove white suburban boy bands to their best apoplectic histrionics and the more graceful, articulate adulthood that characterizes the genre's more contemporary potency. Take the empathetic, soaring elegance of ""Old and Tired"", a comforting song about age and loneliness whittling down a loved one's spirits: it's more elegant and meaningful a statement than anything <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/543-brand-new/"">Jesse Lacey</a> ever howled, and it's delivered in just as powerful a package.</p>
<p>When they align themselves with pop punk's present, however, Chumped also lean away from the elements that turned an earlier generation's entitled complaints into pure gold: tight, slick, almost stupidly indulgent <i>pop</i> songwriting, completely littered with auditory <i>umami</i>. Not every DIY outfit in Brooklyn has the ability to write these kinds of songs, but Chumped, when they hammer it down and let it rip, can pull it off. Purists may argue that it's this sickly sweetness that led to the end the genre's first era, but in today's overflowing indie milieu, melody and structure are what mark an album as exceptional. There are real possibilities buried here, just below the surface, and Chumped might produce greatness if they can dig them up.</p></div>"|20040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20040-teenage-retirement/|7.3|Devon Maloney

""<i>The Ape Of God</i> is two entirely different albums. If you downloaded some leaked shit, you don’t have either.""</p>
<p>Working in cahoots with their new label, <a href=""https://www.profoundlorerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Profound Lore Records</a>, Old Man Gloom had circulated an eight-track, 46-minute promotional download called <i>The Ape of God</i>, portraying it as their second release since ending an eight-year hiatus two years earlier. Reviews appeared, followed, as the band predicted, by back-channel leaks. That’s when Old Man Gloom announced that the version many might have swiped was a carefully edited combination of two albums sharing one name. The bait had been stripped of essential interludes and lengthier pieces. Both records, the band said, would arrive on their proper release date. ""The interweb has sucked all the fun out of releasing records and we wanted people to be fucking surprised by something again,"" <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/16664-old-man-gloom-the-ape-of-god-part-two-album-stream"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aaron Turner subsequently told <i>The Quietus</i></a>. ""At least we tried.""</p>
<p>In one rather isolated online corner, a flood of vitriol, kudos, and <i>schadenfreude</i> began. Some fans praised the ruse’s ingenious simplicity. Others called Old Man Gloom ""douchebags,"" ""fascist pricks,"" and ""clowns,"" or pointed out that bogus promos meant to hoodwink critics and pirates weren’t as novel as the band might have hoped. Reviewers who had already invested time in the album’s early edition <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/sucker-for-punishment-grand-and-morbid/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">complained, somewhat legitimately,</a> that they’d been cheated of their time while trying to do their jobs—that is, many suffered for the sins of a few. But the duplicitous release should have come as, at worst, only a slight shock; after all, what have Old Man Gloom done for the last 15 years but try to troll would-be fans? From the way they delivered <i>The Ape of God</i> to the fastidious and belligerent mess the dual albums themselves deliver, these 12 tracks are the most perfectly provocative Old Man Gloom have ever been.</p>
<p>When they’ve existed at all, Old Man Gloom have thrived in a state of concrete fluidity. Each of their albums has been its own gyre of heavy elements, tumbling d-beat and doom, harsh noise and hardcore, stoner rock and psychedelic rock into exuberant if sometimes uneven anti-patterns. A mix of audacity and devil-may-care enthusiasm powered their earlier records; during the first three tracks of 2004’s <i>Christmas</i>, for instance, they moved from a near-collage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"">Neurosis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> to a grindcore outburst to an alien instrumental reverie that suggested a punk rocker’s take on the early tape works of Gordon Mumma. Somehow, it worked. It’s as if the parents of the members—Turner, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"">Converge</a>’s Nate Newton, Cave In’s Caleb Scofield, versatile drummer Santos Mantano—told the kids they could be anything they wanted to be when they grew up, and that the quartet continues to hold that assurance as safe as scripture. Old Man Gloom’s boastful inability to make up their collective mind about what kind of band they are makes them incredibly divisive. They are either adored or reviled. That seems to be the way they prefer it, anyway.</p>
<p><i>The Ape of God </i>thrills with that indecision, amplifying it through two albums that act as clashing, fraternal twins. The first set is the most streamlined Old Man Gloom effort to date, as the band moves through eight songs in 43 minutes. Hardcore bruiser ""Fist of Fury"" is aggression couched in antiphony, with the band bounding into straightforward pounce only to stop in perfect time for screams barked over beds of near-silence. ""Never Enter"" delivers the kind of jubilant, anthemic agitation that served as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"">Fucked Up</a>’s early calling card, while opener ""Eden’s Gates"" peaks in a fists-up, sludge-metal sing-along that seems to have crept north from the same bayou as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32290-eyehategod/"">Eyehategod</a> or Down. But even the straightest bits here are demented and warped. That pummel of ""Fist of Fury"" arrives over an organ-and-guitar drone that only grows louder. And the two minutes of radical, mean post-punk that form the core of ""The Lash"" follow nearly five minutes of full-band improvisation, where Old Man Gloom seem to be fighting the symptoms of dying equipment. Its din emerges from the end of ""Simia Die"", a wordless anthem that condenses the power and poignancy of post-metal into a tune that takes a third of the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3472-pelican/"">Pelican</a> or Turner’s old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"">Isis</a> would need to reach such heights. They do that by suspending the motion of a burly riff, walloping beat and celestial choir until one definitive, romantic crescendo arrives. It’s perhaps Old Man Gloom’s best-ever rendezvous of impact <i>and</i> economy, a union generally not favored by such indulgent explorers.</p>
<p>That’s the side of Old Man Gloom that arrives unfettered for the second set. The bulk of the disc was omitted from the more concise promotional tease; perhaps not coincidentally, it’s the half that renders <i>The Ape of God</i> essential. Everything that’s ever made Old Man Gloom captivating collides in these four tracks and 47 minutes. ""A Hideous Nightmare Lie Upon the World"" moves from a whirlpool of distortion and disembodied vocals into a tide of turgid doom. Scofield’s bass line is a menace, rebelling against Montano’s drumset like an angry stepchild; Newton and Turner’s guitars twist in and out of feedback-and-effects tangles, flipping between militant riffs and anarchist bedlam. Both ""Predators"" and ""Arrows to Our Hearts"" find Old Man Gloom playing hide-and-seek with the cores of their own songs, dividing the action between blown-out instrumental tangents and delightful detours. All Old Man Gloom albums have functioned in much that same way, but here, they mete the misdirection with new momentum. That is, though some of these songs last 14 minutes, they lag very little between start and finish.</p>
<p>There’s no better example, and no better moment on any Old Man Gloom album, than ""Burden"", which opens set two. At large, it’s a punishing doom march, an unafraid parade toward an ever-widening abyss. But the quartet takes its time getting into formation, tinkering first with punishing feedback, static bursts, and riffs that seem to lampoon what’s coming next. For a work that lasts as long as many major motion pictures, <i>The Ape of God</i> mostly avoids monoliths, a consequence of Old Man Gloom’s varied interests. ""Burden"" is their one concession to the colossal. Extrapolated brilliantly for a quarter-hour, it’s a coup of force and focus.</p>
<p>Old Man Gloom revel in the disorienting. As early as their debut, they spotted unseen through-lines between disparate musical realms and raced along them. That very approach has made them a hard sale, because quantifying, categorizing, or controlling what they hoped to achieve seemed so difficult. But the context for their brand of ruthless patchwork has increased in recent years, as the borders of once-obdurate niches and subgenres have been bled. Old Man Gloom sound a little less outlandish than they once did, then, less like separatists in a stronghold of one than early adopters in a land of intrigue and opportunity. Following the band’s 2012 return with the fine but slight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16748-no/""><i>NO</i></a>, <i>The Ape of God</i>—in all its two-volume, high-volume upheaval—reasserts their eminence in that field.

<p>Somewhere in there, he also released the four solo albums that have now been reissued in expanded editions, with an extra CD appended to each.

<p>The album that replaced <i>My Squelchy Life</i> in the context of 1992 was <i>Nerve Net</i>, which is more obviously a product of its time than any other Eno record. It's roughly half-vocal, half-instrumental, and half-baked.

The album's home stretch features two consecutive mixes of the not-up-to-much instrumental ""Web"", totaling over 15 tedious minutes. </p>
<p>The bonus disc on the reissue, though, is its real draw: <i>My Squelchy Life</i>, Eno's most enjoyable solo album of the '90s by a wide margin. It's only ""retrospective"" (as he dismissed it) in the sense that it plays to some of the strengths he'd demonstrated earlier in his career, like songwriting and singing. (A couple of its songs were re-edited for <i>Nerve Net</i>, and most of the rest were parceled out on one release or another over the next few years; this is the first time it's all officially appeared in one place.)

<p>The 10 rhythmless, tuneless pieces that make up <i>The Shutov Assembly</i>, also released in 1992 but recorded between 1985 and 1990, are named after places where Eno had done image-and-sound installations—although presenting them outside those contexts also depleted whatever charge they might have had. Eno later described them as sketches for orchestral works: electronically generated tones that acoustic instruments were meant to somehow replicate. They are whooshy, and evaporate as soon as they're over. The bonus disc is seven more pieces from the same era, in the same amorphous vein, although a few of them have some sort of beat; ""Storm"" even incorporates what sounds like another Fripp guitar solo.</p>

But the softly echoing pings and plinks of ""Neroli"" are instantly overfamiliar; without the famous name on the cover, no one would have given it a second thought. The new reissue pairs it with a previously unreleased hour-long drone piece from 1992, ""New Space Music"", which mostly suggests that Eno had figured out how to hold down keys for a really long time.</p>
<p>1997's <i>The Drop</i> is a set of mostly brief instrumentals—and one very long one, ""Iced World""—in a style Eno referred to as ""Unwelcome Jazz"" (because, he explained, ""most of the people I played them to don't really like them""). They're semi-abstract or ""generative"" electronic pieces, made with instrumental sounds that already have cultural associations, like piano, early-hip-hop drum machines, and, on ""Dear World,"" samples of Eno's own voice. It's not uninteresting to hear once.

But the softly echoing pings and plinks of ""Neroli"" are instantly overfamiliar; without the famous name on the cover, no one would have given it a second thought. The new reissue pairs it with a previously unreleased hour-long drone piece from 1992, ""New Space Music"", which mostly suggests that Eno had figured out how to hold down keys for a really long time.</p>
<p>1997's <i>The Drop</i> is a set of mostly brief instrumentals—and one very long one, ""Iced World""—in a style Eno referred to as ""Unwelcome Jazz"" (because, he explained, ""most of the people I played them to don't really like them""). They're semi-abstract or ""generative"" electronic pieces, made with instrumental sounds that already have cultural associations, like piano, early-hip-hop drum machines, and, on ""Dear World,"" samples of Eno's own voice. It's not uninteresting to hear once. The extra disc here is a set of <i>The Drop's</i> outtakes and alternate versions, originally sold as a limited edition at a Tokyo exhibition of Eno's ""77 Million Paintings"".</p>
<p>Eno subsequently recorded a string of limited-edition soundtracks to installation pieces, but his next solo album to see wide release would be 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2808-another-day-on-earth/""><i>Another Day on Earth</i></a>. It included the same version of the lovely, slowly pulsing ""Under"" that had originally been intended to appear on <i>My Squelchy Life</i>—a song whose ""retrospective"" character had apparently worn off in the intervening 14 years.</p></div>"|20032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20032-brian-eno-nerve-netthe-shutov-assemblynerolithe-drop/|3.6|Douglas Wolk

Fortunately, that’s not what we’re promised on <i>When You Land Here, It’s Time to Return</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1503-flake-music"">Flake Music</a>’s only full-length LP, originally released in 1997, didn’t hit the same high marks of Mercer’s subsequent work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins"">the Shins</a>, nor did it really sound like it aspired to. But unlike the discofied dross of his collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse"">Danger Mouse</a>, Mercer’s earlier band’s inability to offer the same pleasures as his more famous group offers something charming in return. Namely, the sound of potential unfulfilled—the retroactive promise that the people involved here were headed towards something great.</p>
<p>Flake Music get tantalizingly close on ""Spanway Hits"", the song where you can most cleanly separate the qualities that would become definitive artistic tics in the future<span>—</span>even more than the thing here that’s actually called ""The Shins"". Over 15 years after the fact, it’s hard to hear it as the work of anyone else; beyond Mercer’s piercing tone which distinguished him from more mumbly peers, there’s still the slight gap between his vocals and the wonderful melodies he writes for them. It lends an appealing degree of human error in his exquisite craftsmanship and he decorates these songs like ornate dioramas, both compact and highly detailed.  There’s a directness on ""Spanway Hits"" that Mercer would later forego—it’s a youthful reminiscence of Big Wheels in the driveway and a poster of Simon LeBon in the bedroom, and how little they eventually mean<span>—""</span>Cut these ties and you’ll see how far apart we are."" This also hints at the subtle bitterness that would seep into the Shins’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7114-chutes-too-narrow/""><i>Chutes Too Narrow</i></a> in particular, though the poison is more potent here (""You’ve got the words to defend/ every bias you’ve learned while being human""). Is it on par with any of the songs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7113-oh-inverted-world/""><i>Oh, Inverted World</i></a>? That’s a matter of taste. Would it <i>fit</i> on <i>Oh, Inverted World</i>? </p>
<p>Not at all, as ""Spanway Hits"" is also the song that most clearly demonstrates what separates Flake Music from the Shins, which is the real, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-thzoa5aBQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">weird divide</a> between ""indie rock"" and ""indie pop"" that becomes more apparent as <i>When You Land Here</i> levels out after its initial peak. While the earliest incarnation of the Shins had basically the same lineup as Flake Music, the major shift was Mercer taking full command of the lyrics. It was not long before the Shins were revealed as more or less <i>him</i>. But from the outset, they had a singular aesthetic, more sourced from the bedroom than the garage<span>—</span><i>Oh, Inverted World</i> was the next to take the baton in the soft parade of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith"">Elliott Smith</a>, the Elephant 6 collective, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian"">Belle and Sebastian</a>, and other songwriters who weren’t opposed to copping from Simon &amp; Garfunkel. There was not a single edge to it, and while there were guitars, bass and drums, they never once <i>rocked</i>.</p>
<p>Conversely, Flake Music is Mercer’s pimpled and angry record collector from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4Y5Ma8DrUI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Know Your Onion!""</a> in real time, and <i>When You Land Here</i> functions as a state-of-the-art indie rock mixtape where he’s the curator rather than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7891-garden-state"">just an inclusion</a>. Seeing as how Mercer and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/636-beirut"">Beirut’</a>s Zach Condon are the only rock musicians of note to ever come from New Mexico, one doubts there was ever an ""Albuquerque sound."" So inevitably, Flake Music reached out in all directions to establish their neighbors, becoming de facto Californians and residents of the Pacific Northwest. </p>
<p>As with most guitar bands in the late '90s, they’re in the shadow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement"">Pavement</a> and Mercer’s lyrics can often crib from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2655-stephen-malkmus/"">Stephen Malkmus</a>’ coding system for legible thoughts and feelings. Relying more on lyrical guitar leads than percussive strumming, ""Mieke"" (which was later included in Shins live sets) and ""Blast Valve"" owe a huge debt to pre-<i>Perfect From Now On</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill"">Built to Spill</a>, albeit with a much higher ratio of twee meekness to heroism. It’s for the best, as the most jarring moment occurs when Mercer stomps on the fuzz pedals for the chorus of ""Structo"" and pissily enunciates the words ""high school"". Meanwhile, if <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop</a> had released <i>When You Land Here</i> in 1997, the fractious rhythms of ""Deluca"" might have tipped them as a passable scion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3986-sunny-day-real-estate"">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>.</p>
<p>It’s all delightful in a scattershot way that betrays the fact that Flake Music had been around for five years at that point. But as with every reissue, the intent seems to be as much of a subject for appraisal as the content. <i>When You Land Here</i> isn’t widely considered a lost classic or ahead of its time, or really much beyond a very good album serving as a reminder of what indie rock sounded like in 1997. With all that said, it’s now been reissued twice. The first time can actually remind you of when reissues were a protracted decision that required balancing financial risk and reward. <i>Oh, Inverted World</i> was a rainmaker for Sub Pop after an unsteady few years and while Flake Music may have been dutifully namechecked in reviews, there’s a good shot that new Shins fans hadn’t heard of them and were unlikely to find the original Omnibus release in stores.</p>
<p>While the Shins are celebrating their fifteenth year of existence, none of their albums nor <i>When You Land Here</i> is celebrating a round number anniversary, which is usually the only requirement for reissue. That said, even if you’ve somehow owned this record twice already, the 2014 version ensures you get something out of this. Both the new artwork and the production do the best job possible of removing everything timestamped from 1997. Kennie Takahashi and J.J. Golden’s respective remix and remaster ensure it has some of the gleam and pop of Broken Bells, though they still maintain the vocal filters and grainy guitars whose subsequent absence made the Shins sound so novel. They’re not the only vestiges of a time when Mercer and company erred towards indie’s defense mechanisms. <i>When You Land Here</i> is a short record as is, one that shrinks even more due to a couple of early instrumental scribblings that level off momentum rather than establishing continuity, to say nothing of ""Vantage"", a five-minute guitar workout that should be closing out a record of <i>other</i> shambling, five-minute guitar workouts.</p>
<p>That might not sound like much of an endorsement for the people who may have actually caught those shows Flake Music did with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/651-califone"">Califone</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a> back when they were both merely up-and-coming indie rock curiosities. But consider that an 18-year old who’s just discovering the Shins right now was six last time <i>When You Land Here</i> was in stores. And most of those stores have probably closed down by now. Or maybe think of it this way: here we are making our year-end lists with some kind of assumption that we’re creating a time capsule of what mattered and what it foretold for the future. In doing so, take a second to think about the records you came across this year that seemed promising, pretty good or ""not quite there"" and a couple of years from now, there’s a good chance they’ll be revealed as a transition towards greatness. It happens all the damn time and while <i>When You Land Here</i> is a fine reminder of a bygone time in indie rock, its current status is also a reminder of our inability to predict the future.</p></div>"|20024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20024-flake-music-when-you-land-here-its-time-to-return/|7.2|Ian Cohen

Over the course of 10 years, three albums, and three EPs, the Bay Area quintet have engulfed themselves in anemones, swum through <a href=""http://giantsquid.bandcamp.com/album/cenotes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cenotes</i></a>, and conducted thorough musical studies of aquatic organisms. Considering that Earthly life started as great big bowl of primordial soup, it isn’t difficult to see how a progressive metal band would take up an oceanographic interest. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2699-mastodon/"" target=""_blank"">Mastodon</a>'s thunderous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5143-leviathan/"" target=""_blank""><i>Leviathan </i></a>springs to mind: a portrait of the sea as a sublime force, engulfing our experiences in life and death and salt. But whereas Mastodon briefly dipped their toes in the water and proceeded to shift their focus elsewhere, Giant Squid have remained entrenched in the depths with sea creatures as their muses, crafting concept album after palatial concept album. Their latest long-play, <i>Minoans</i>, details the tragic story of a fatal struggle between man and the sea—and the figurative and literal empires lost in the chaos.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Minoans </i>centers around the Bronze Age civilization of the same name, which flourished on the island of Crete beginning around 2700 to 1450 BCE before coming to a sudden, mysterious end (potential culprits identified by historians include a volcanic eruption on nearby Santorini, recurring tsunamis and earthquakes, and internal political turmoil). The Minoans are widely regarded as the inspiration for the legend of Atlantis, and by extension, the original overseers of the archetypal ""lost world""—and since so many questions remain, their narrative leaves plenty of room for interpretation. The aforementioned cataclysms serve as landmarks on the album, as well as apexes of narrative and musical tension. There's the looming ""Thera"", so named for Santorini’s deadly volcano, as well as a playful ode to the ""Sixty Foot Waves"" that lashed the shoreline.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite their dedicated study of ancient lore, Giant Squid skew modern in their instrumental preferences, opting for quaking electric guitars and brittle synths over lyre or cithara. Most of the momentum is supplied by Zack Farwell’s restrained drumming, showcased prominently in his work with the similarly forlorn <a href=""http://grayceon.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grayceon</a>. His calculated pauses are subsequently filled in by multilayered vocal harmonies and the leathery whispers of Jackie Perez Gratz’s cello, with the occasional opulent synth part. Such an airy approach allows Giant Squid to freely coast between hymnal ballads (""The Pearl and the Parthenon"", ""Palace of Knossos"") and hard rock (the manic, constantly-morphing ""Sixty Foot Waves"") on a melancholic drift, often within the span of a single song.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For those who desire immediate thrills, such a carefully-dosed approach to tension could scan unsavorily—and indeed, <i>Minoans'</i> sedate pace won't do much to sway listeners with a disdain for post-metal. There are certainly bursts of immediacy: the leaden thump of ""Mycineans"", the proggy trappings of ""Sixty Foot Waves"", and the mesmerizing ""Sir Arthur Evans"", which welds doomy stylings to Dorian frameworks. Still, like their namesake animal, Giant Squid prefers to kill by elegance and discipline, as opposed to throwing a tantrum like <i>Leviathan</i>'s Moby Dick. Consider it a show of cathartic self-control, as well as a nod to the cumulative nature of albums past.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Why revisit ancient Cretean history two thousand years after the fact? Consider the words of the American writer and philosopher Will Durant, who responded to the discovery of Minoan civilization in the early 20th century by referring to it as ""the first link in the European chain."" The early trappings of western civilization (and by extension, western music) were in cities on the sea, making Giant Squid's latest bout of spelunking all the more mysterious—and perhaps even a little bit meta.</p></div>"|19951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19951-minoans/|7.1|Zoe Camp

Sure, the history of popular music is full of excellent bands with unwieldily large lineups (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1505-funkadelic/"">Funkadelic</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a> on <i>Stop Making Sense</i>). Sometimes, it's just a mess (various jam, nu-metal, and high school talent show bands). King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard are a seven-person band from Australia who specialize in unpredictable psychedelic music. Their ranks include two drummers, three guitarists, and a harmonica player. To reiterate: They're a septet with a name that sounds like it could've been ripped from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Masters of the Universe""</a> who make heady soundscapes punctuated by blues harp.</p>
<p>Ridiculous as this all sounds on paper, King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard aren't wasting anyone's time with throwaway joke music. While they started as a side-project (following in the great Australian tradition where each member plays in other groups) and <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-enter-your-mind-fuzz/#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-admitted ""joke band""</a>, the Melbourne band have definitely paid their dues over the past four years with critically acclaimed live sets and a prolific string of records. <i>I'm in Your Mind Fuzz</i> is their fifth album to date, and if their discography tells a story, it's one of a band who never fully settle into one sound. Their album <i><a href=""http://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/album/oddments"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oddments</a> </i>from earlier this year featured flashes of bubblegum pop and Hammond organ-led soul. On their debut album <a href=""http://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/album/12-bar-bruise"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>12 Bar Bruise</i></a>, they invoked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31293-the-oblivians"">Oblivians</a>-style garage punk. It's never clear from the outset exactly which path they'll explore or what sounds they'll plop into the mix along the way. Horses neighing, xylophones, and instruments of unidentifiable origins have appeared in their songs, and impressively, King Gizzard always manage to wrangle the chaos into well-crafted compositions.</p>
<p>As usual, the band's latest collection, <i>I'm in Your Mind Fuzz</i>, partially recorded at Daptone in Brooklyn,<i> </i>isn't easily categorized. While the blues feels like an inevitable touchstone thanks to Ambrose Kenny-Smith's harmonica (disorienting as it sounds when caked in psychedelic effects), it's also got the psych pop jaunt of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/150953-Millennium-The"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Millennium</a>. But as varied as King Gizzard are, they've established one surefire safe bet with each record: They implement their ""more is more"" approach for maximum impact. Their songs are dense, intricately crafted, and most importantly, powerful. It's appropriate that <i>Mind Fuzz</i> is out via <a href=""http://www.castlefacerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Castle Face</a> (in North America—<a href=""http://heavenlyrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavenly</a>'s got it out in Europe and <a href=""http://www.flightless.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flightless</a> once again have them covered in Australia), as the 17-minute ripper ""Am I in Heaven?"" is arguably the best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a> track to be released in 2014. There are easy comparisons to be drawn between the two bands—Stu Mackenzie lets out a point-perfect John Dwyer ""WOO"" before employing explosive, rapidfire guitar lines. And like their label overlords, King Gizz also know when to let urgency eventually give way to elation.</p>
<p>The album's overall lyrical concept is mind control. If they've managed to brainwash their listeners, they've done it by making a record that's hard to tune out. Take, for example, <i>I'm in Your Mind Fuzz</i>'s absolute peak—the opening 12-minute chunk comprising the four song stretch of ""I'm in Your Mind"" to ""I'm in Your Mind Fuzz"". They churn and choogle relentlessly forward, each rafter-reaching jam bleeding into the next. The rhythm section—bassist Lucas Skinner, drummers Michael Cavanagh and Eric Moore—stay locked in the same groove across all four songs while the guitars, harmonica, and Mackenzie's vocals explore various melodies within that structure—different movements operating in the same theme. </p>
<p>But a steady stream of bangers comes at a price. When you open with a sprint, things eventually have to slow down, and the comedown is right where King Gizzard trip up. Immediately following the all-power introduction are a pair of tracks (""Empty"" and ""Hot Water"") that sound like watered-down versions of what came before them. They make the save later, though, closing the album with some of their best slow jams. (Two of which are titled ""Slow Jam"".) And, right when it seems that they've settled into a restrained groove, they shake it up again: the speed picks up, guitar solos are delivered, vocals are augmented and distorted. King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard don't do predictability.</p></div>"|20019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20019-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-im-in-your-mind-fuzz/|7.0|Evan Minsker

There's a subset of producers who made their names, in part, by hiding their identities, at least at first; just think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"">John Talabot</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28512-redshape/"">Redshape</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>. The popularity of that strategy, in recent years, has dovetailed with a design philosophy that emphasizes mystery over clarity. In certain record stores, it sometimes seems that the hand-stamped white labels with little or no identifying information outnumber, by a considerable margin, what I guess you could call ""normal"" records, where you have some semblance of an idea who made the thing. Underground techno, in particular, has developed a conspicuously sub-rosa aura, keen to convey the impression that all those slabs of wax had been recorded in secret, pressed up in some dank basement, and sold out of the back of someone's car.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, though, before it became a shtick, facelessness was just par for the course in techno, a natural byproduct of the way the music was made and consumed—recorded by amateur producers, released by fly-by-night record labels, and spun in darkened rooms to audiences who probably had no idea what was playing at any given moment anyway. Just as importantly, techno's facelessness had ideological aims; it was a reminder that the individual was less important than the collective.</p>
<p>The Dutch-born, Berlin-based DJ Steffi runs a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dolly/232895513465570"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hand-stamped white-label imprint</a> herself, but I'm pretty sure that the title of her new album, <i>Power of Anonymity</i>, is meant to evoke the more romantic aspects of techno facelessness—both the privileging of scenius over genius and the idea that, as long as the music is good, it doesn't matter what the name on the center sticker is; that when a DJ has earned the dancers' trust, Shazam becomes unnecessary, because the moment itself is too precious to sacrifice for a paltry morsel of metadata. (As a resident DJ at Panorama Bar, Steffi understands this concept as well as anyone. The DJ booth there is on the same level as the dancefloor, and so it is entirely possible to spend hours in the crowd without having the faintest idea who might be playing.)</p>
<p>She has made an album equal to that ethos. There are no gimmicks here. These are club tracks, through and through—late-night techno that radiates a deep blue glow beneath its brushed-metal surface. It would be wrong to call them workmanlike—no one will ever mistake these for humdrum DJ tools—but they're not exactly virtuosic, either; they go out of their way to sound like approximations of an ideal type, rather than expressions of individual genius. With the exception of ""Treasure Seeking"", a springy electro-funk jam that takes inspiration from A Number of Names and Vanity 6, they're all instrumentals, and their similarities tend to eclipse their differences. They all share the same minor chords and moody synth wash; their pieces seem largely interchangeable. On ""Selfhood"", a little two-note bassline digs in its heels; on ""Bag of Crystals"", it reappears as a mirror image, toggling up instead of down. The majority of the album's cuts are paced somewhere north of 130 beats per minute. They can be gorgeous, and emotional, and even sentimental, but they're not meant to be calmly considered from a safe remove—they're designed to throw yourself into, with a serenely ecstatic kind of gusto.</p>
<p>The album, her second, is tougher, deeper, more nuanced, and more confident than her 2011 debut, <i>Yours &amp; Mine</i>. Stylistically, it's a fusion of classic Detroit and Berlin techno—the rich tones and pumping chords of the former, the dub-assisted exploration of space of the latter. There are echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5751-robert-hood/"">Robert Hood</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"">Basic Channel</a>, as well as some of the high, lonesome ostinatos of DJ Pierre's ""Wild Pitch"" style; there's also a pronounced electro influence in ""Bang for Your Buck"", ""JBW25"", and ""Treasure Seeking"", all of which are enlivened by a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/"">Drexciyan</a> sense of snap and squelch. But nothing here feels throwback, merely timeless—an overused term that, for once, earns its place. Formally and technologically, any of these tracks might have been made at any point in the past 25 years. Her specialty is in creating streamlined arrangements consisting of multiple tonal parts that all interlock; no single one of them plays the lead, and there are rarely any melodies to speak of. Instead, they tend to move separately but together, in sync, rippling as naturally as the surface of a rain-dappled lake.</p>
<p>Those intricate mechanics betray the album's key irony: it would be hard to imagine anyone <i>but </i>Steffi making this particular collection. <i>Power of Anonymity </i>is a masterclass in the sleight-of-hand that we call techno; there is virtuosity in the music's very attempts to sneak past under the cover of darkness. It may pass unidentified, but it will not go unnoticed.</p></div>"|19839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19839-steffi-power-of-anonymity/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

And those are roots that even his most recent work, and that of the <a href=""http://maddecent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Decent</a> imprint, can be traced to in more or less a straight line.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the debut solo album he released in the midst of all those identity-building works tends to throw people off. For the unfamiliar: <i>Florida </i>is a trip-hop record. Crucially, it's a trip-hop record from 2004, released two years after obvious comparison points <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"">DJ Shadow</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3581-rjd2/"">RJD2</a> had released albums (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2373-the-private-press/""><i>The Private Press </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6797-deadringer/""><i>Deadringer</i></a>) that were tearing that genre's remnants to pieces. So where'd this morose, rarely danceable, sometimes weirdly beautiful record come from, and why does so little Diplo's done since sound anything like it?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The reissue titled <i>F10RIDA </i>takes a shot at giving some additional background to Diplo's come-up during the making of this record, a massive undertaking that includes <a href=""http://blog.bittorrent.com/2014/11/17/diplo-brings-f10rida-to-bittorrent-bundle/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>a special BitTorrent partnership</span></a> and a multimedia-minded take on archival materials. (Meaning mostly photos, email correspondence transcripts, remixes, unreleased material, and the component ""stems"" of the track ""Into the Sun"".) Alongside the promotional-kit feel to all this is <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/bigdadasound/diplo-f10rida-album-commentary"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>the nearly 10-minute commentary</span></a> Diplo contributed to <a href=""http://www.bigdada.com/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Dada</a>'s SoundCloud, where he lays out his mind state at the time the record came together: rooted in an upbringing in both South and Central Florida, making self-taught loops on a cheap stolen sampler, taking inspirational cues from Shadow and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a> and J-Swift, and trying to conjure up ethereal, spooky weirdness with limited means. What he came out with was inspired by ""the truest thing I know""—where he lived, and what he took from those environs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Diplo's Florida is a place to escape before it swallows you: the sun goes down even in the Sunshine State; it's a place of</span><span> late-night post-job bus rides and weed-and-headphones rumination sessions. The album has the feel of a</span><span> Southern Gothic elegy for an early life since abandoned, which makes the uncharacteristic nature of the record a bit more compelling. Bummer Diplo isn't a facet we see or hear much of, and even when the album is derivative and simple, if offers some insight into where his head was when he started.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But this is the work of someone who's not quite there yet, especially because his ""there"" isn't even mapped out. Wesley Pentz has been everything from savvy adapter to clumsy appropriator, but in the process he found a route into a distinct persona. <i>Florida</i>, meanwhile, is little more than the sum of influences. Given the Diplo we know now, it seems (proto)typical that even a primordial release of his would boast a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12970-vybz-kartel/"">Vybz Kartel</a> appearance; the Nintendo-cartridge banger ""Diplo Rhythm"" makes his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer"">Major Lazer</a> moves seem like a foregone conclusion in retrospect. It's a bit more surprising that this record would also have a guest spot by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1557-freestyle-fellowship/"">Freestyle Fellowship</a>'s P.E.A.C.E., right in the middle of an era where left coast indie rap was maybe the last thing your average Hollertronix party attendee would claim allegiance to. But the fact that it's a rubber band double-time over the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a>-tabla pastiche ""Indian Thick Jawns"" at least makes it a stealth classic in both artists' catalogs, one that plays to both their familiar strengths.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's the atypical moodier stuff that's more mixed. Sometimes it's just a loop that sounds interesting until it doesn't. There's some ambition in the longer cuts, an urge to fit in all sorts of ideas and sources in tracks like the snare-riddled, soul-jazz gloom of ""Way More"" and the swampy, bleary-eyed nine-minute break parade ""Works"", which pulls strength from restlessness. It all comes together brilliantly in ""Summer's Gonna Hurt You"", a keyboard-driven Brit-prog lament that he rewires with intricate boom-clap drums. It's like he heard the thunderstorm breaks on Shadow's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csWzB94_ULk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain""</a> and pledged to make a version informed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5406-ugk/"">UGK</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's more of that on the bonus material, the best of which comes from 2003's <i>Epistemology Suite </i>EP, triangulating early Funkadelic, sound collage, and Mannie Fresh snare rolls. Other material's a bit shorter on weirdness and personality. The remixes go even further in tracking a big muddy footprint all over the context of this record—I know things have changed for Diplo, and as goes Diplo so goes the pop world and all that, but hearing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7244-metronomy/"">Metronomy</a> rework ""Diplo Rhythm"" progenitor ""Newsflash"" into galumphing synth-horn overload or Derek Allen slather wubwub seizures all over ""Summer's Gonna Hurt You"" doesn't say much for progress. Diplo's music hasn't regressed over the last 10 years, and neither have his sensibilities. But sometimes it's best to let the weirdness stand on its own, make a special place for it, and wonder where else it could've been taken.</p></div>"|20044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20044-diplo-florida/|6.0|Nate Patrin

Reilly. That video, directed by Eric Wareheim of Tim and Eric, starts out as an extremely on-the-nose parody of Black Friday, but by refusing to let up on the gas, Wareheim manages to bring it to an interesting climax in the form of a Mexican Standoff, a la <i>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.</i></p>
<p>The video is at once strange, annoying, compelling, and obvious, which makes it a perfect vehicle for Mr. Oizo’s music. His new album, <i>The Church, </i>is his first for <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a>, but it’s very much in tune with his methods for the past decade, taking the electronic sounds of the moment—in this case, trap, post-dubstep, and electro—and warping them in a fun-house mirror. Oizo, whose real name is Quentin Dupieux, has been compared to his fellow Frenchmen, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"">Justice</a>, many times in the past, and there’s definitely something there. But his music also bears thinking about in relation to newer artists; now that PC Music has emerged, Oizo almost feels like a long-standing, supervillianous nemesis to that candy-brite collective.</p>
<p>Does that mean that Dupieux has long been ahead of his time? Certainly. His music exists to disturb the natural state of things; he makes use of the dissonance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32295-copeland/"">Inga Copeland</a> but substitutes her icy cool for off-the-wall juvenilia. His love of the puerile is probably the most obvious element of his sound. Take ""Dry Run"", which, though it bears some resemblance to ""Turn Down for What"", substitutes that ubiquitous mantra with the goofy-voiced and terrifying plea to ""scream for daddy.""</p>
<p>This kind of cartoonish menace appears many times throughout <i>The Church. ""</i>Mass Doom"", a standout here, could soundtrack ""Adventure Time"" if the show were produced by the Joker—a sense of foreboding lurks within its impossibly cartoonish sound effects. ""iSoap'""s got a nice groove which soon gets torn apart by a brassy loop plaguing you with its endless repetition like water torture.</p>
<p>The best tracks on the record are the ones confident enough to place their weirdness in the foreground. With the bizarro trap of ""Bear Biscuit"" (which even includes some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a>-like sampling at its tail) and the straightforward thump of ""Ham"", Dupieux seems to put all his cards on the table and the result are the two most compelling songs on the record.</p>
<p>But what’s most frustrating about Mr. Oizo is that, despite all his rule-breaking, his songs quickly start to feel shallow, as if he’s run out of ideas. ""Memorex"", the shortest song on the record, is one loop and a squeaker for the entirety of its running time, and once you get over their more irritating aspects, most of the songs here feel just that simple.</p>
<p>Then again, striving for anticlimax is a form of the avant garde. The title track ends the record, and when cloaked in words, Mr. Oizo’s aimless clowning becomes explicit. The song tells the story of a group of friends who get bored and steal cars. Many times throughout the song, it feels as if the group will do something terrible, particularly when the music drops and they go to the church. But nothing especially violent happens. The track is all suggestion. Despite the genuine fear that Oizo manages to build-up with this and other tracks on <i>The Church, </i>he does it all through the power of suggestion. Nothing ever really happens.</p></div>"|20028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20028-mr-oizo-the-church/|4.9|Jonah Bromwich

After all, Gal Aner and Jordan Czamanski are a pair of pot-smoking, disheveled former jazzbos known for long, improvisational synth-and-drum-machine jams that wobble on the edge between late-night abandon and psychedelic freak-out. Young Republicans they are not. Hell, the Amsterdam-based duo has a record called <i>Jewsex</i>, whose cover features some rather suggestive-looking pastries against a matzo-cracker background, while their <i>Unleash the Golem</i> EPs rebuke the right-wing policies of their native Israel. These mischievous miscreants are the opposite of clean-cut, and proud of it.</p>
<p>But there's an element of truth to the title, too. On their inspired third album for Amsterdam's <a href=""http://www.dekmantel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dekmantel</a> label, they sound tighter and more focused than ever. That's especially notable given the seat-of-the-pants ethos of their live sets, in which they take the stage armed with racks of hardware—synths, drum machines, effects, an occasional guitar, no computer—and make it up as they go along, building beats and melodies from scratch. Those sets (as well as their Magic Mountain High performances with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22045-move-d/"">Move D</a> and the Mulholland Free Clinic lineup featuring Move D and Jonah Sharp) can be awesome, mind-expanding affairs, but they also come with all the pacing issues you might expect from two guys trying to wring a couple hours' worth of spontaneous magic from racks of capricious electronics; the peaks are invariably accompanied by troughs. Here, in contrast, they've clearly chosen only the best, most compelling bits from their studio sessions—the clean cuts, as it were.</p>
<p>The title track might be the most direct thing they've ever done. After the murky contortions of their last album, 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17192-techno-primitivism/""><i>Techno Primitivism</i></a>, the song's sparkling arpeggios and unabashedly sentimental synth lead radiate a kind of bittersweet optimism; it is simple and yet deceptively complex all at once, its various moving pieces locking together like the gears of a battered, but still highly effective machine for leveraging hip movements to tug at heartstrings.</p>
<p>And ""Clean-Cut"" sets the tone for much of the album. ""Whippersnapper"" is a Detroit night-drive in the tradition of Carl Craig's <i>Landcruising</i>, simultaneously cool-headed and wide-eyed. ""SP Shakes"" applies a shimmering mist of ambient synths to Afrobeat-inspired bass with crackling dub accents. And ""Anywhere"", the highlight of the album's back half, sounds like their interpretation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28083-dam-funk/"">Dâm-Funk</a> in full-on devotional mode, right down to the falsetto vocals and a grinding guitar solo that I like to imagine Aner recording on his knees, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a>.</p>
<p>But not everything on the album is so straightforward. ""Deadwood City"" starts off like a wriggling and relatively uncomplicated acid-house number—jacking 909s, fluttering chords, a ribbiting-frog bassline inspired, perhaps, by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/138-art-of-noise/"">Art of Noise</a>'s hyperactive Fairlight CMI—but shortly after it reaches its high-energy climax, the beat drops out, the tones go sour, and it all washes away like so much spilled beer and cigarette butts being flushed down the drain, the morning after the party. The well-named ""Swamp Things"" pairs free-floating saxophone and rock-tumbler arpeggios with distant Detroit techno chug; ""Eventide"" evokes 4th-world ambient jazz with spacey synth zaps and '80s New Age; and the minimalist, drum-free ""Maharaja Mark"" might be an answer to the question, ""What would it feel like to be made of liquid metal""? ""Schmofield"", another standout, marks the album's center of gravity, falling halfway between techno convention and serialist jazz-flute meandering. It's that careful balance that makes <i>Clean-Cut</i> so satisfying. They could just have well have named the album <i>Freak Mullet</i>: It may be business in the front, sure, but it's all acid-soaked party in the back.</p></div>"|19973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19973-juju-jordash-clean-cut/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

As that project morphed from minimal, no-fi ambient work into a '60s-leaning guitar-pop act before finally settling down as a freaky folk band under the similarly punny moniker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31487-salvia-plath/"">Salvia Plath</a>, his <i>M.O.</i> remained the same: delve wholeheartedly into a well-trodden genre from the past and warp it with an eccentric, acid-addled approach to production and composition. Now, he's sparked up another endeavor with longtime friend and occasional collaborator Sasha Desree called Silk Rhodes that applies that same method to the familiar tropes of '70s funk and soul, all the while remaining just offbeat enough to avoid pastiche.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">After a brief introductory track—complete with a dazed narrator exclaiming ""this is crazy!""—the record's lead single and obvious standout ""Pains"" slowly clatters in as a thesis statement of sorts for the 10 tracks that follow. Built around a swooning string sample, droning organ lines, and the slow shimmer of a lightly tremoloed guitar line, it's a hazy deconstruction of the slinky R&amp;B tracks that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"">D'Angelo</a> has chunked out over time. All the while, Desree sings spiraling falsetto sweet nothings and offers up a lyrical platitude that seems to sum up their status as tinkerers in established fields: ""all things must change and remain.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But if Collins is to be believed, none of the similarities to icons from the annals of soul's history (see also the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>-isms of ""Realtime"" or the Chicago house send-up ""Personal Use"") were intentional homages. It was instead what came to the duo unconsciously while<a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/silk-rhodes-the-cosmonauts-of-soul"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> tripping on the front porch of a house they shared in Baltimore</a>. While that was only the direct circumstance for the creation of the eccentric funk track ""Face 2 Face"", it's a mode of working that seems to explain the record's idiosyncrasies. Even on ""Pains"", which is as close as this record gets to the rearview mirror worship of similarly silky acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"">Gayngs</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29728-teen-inc/"">Inc.</a>, Desree's otherworldly vocalizations appear mostly unadorned—the usual orchestral flourishes that you might expect in this sphere give way to downtrodden minimalism. It's a tactic they pick up occasionally throughout the record, and all of its best moments, including the narcotized, drumless ballads ""This Painted World"" and ""Barely New"", demonstrate their dedication to counterintuitive arrangements and fractured songwriting.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With Desree and Collins' predilection toward sparse instrumentals in mind, at a breezy half-hour runtime <i>Silk Rhodes </i>could easily feel like an unnecessarily slight release. But those shorter tracks end up being one of the record's great strengths. Even when they occasionally stumble upon a melody that might start to feel a little too familiar, as on the wordless ""ahh-ahhs"" that fill ""Group 1987"", they're quick to shuffle to the next track, letting the disorienting lurch between songs serve as substitute for groundbreaking experimentalism. On each of his many releases to date, Collins is always trying to reinvent one wheel or another, and even though that's traditionally seen as a fruitless exercise, what he and Desree have ended up with on <i>Silk Rhodes</i> is an invention worth marveling at in its own right.</span></p></div>"|19987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19987-silk-rhodes-silk-rhodes/|7.5|Colin Joyce

The major labels who rushed in to scoop up its biggest names two years ago have all but moved on—Interscope severed its ties with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a> in October, and <a href=""http://www.rapbasement.com/lil-durk-2/102914-lil-durk-reportedly-dropped-def-jam.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rumors have surfaced</a> that Def Jam has done the same with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"">Lil Durk</a>, although at this time he's <a href=""http://www.defjam.com/artists/lil-durk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">still listed on their roster of artists</a>. Two years after its release, Keef's lightning-in-a-bottle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17477-finally-rich/""><i>Finally Rich</i></a> remains the only full-length drill project to have been officially released through a major.</p>
<p>Whether this is the fault of the labels or the artists themselves is beyond the point. But as is often the case, a lot of the most interesting work from a scene emerges once the spotlight has shifted elsewhere and its artists are free to pursue their own interests rather than having to bend to the will of their corporate benefactors. Case in point: SD (born Sadiki Thirston) opted for the independent route from the beginning, releasing three mixtapes over the last two years and establishing himself as a reliable if unsung practitioner of the sound, content to color within its lines instead of pushing them further outward. His debut album, <i>Truly Blessed</i>, doesn't reinvent drill, but it manages to highlight that it's always existed in close proximity to pop, even if it's the kind that never misses an opportunity to elbow you in the gut.</p>
<p>There are zero guests on <i>Truly Blessed</i>, but SD doesn't try very hard to hide the influences of his contemporaries that can be heard throughout the album. He doesn't need to—his greatest strength lies in his gifts as a synthesist, studying the music of those around him and hand-picking only what he needs most. Opener ""Confident"" finds the 20-year-old sounding, especially with the lurching melody he rolls around during his verses, like a less marble-mouthed Chief Keef. In many ways, the album sounds like the kind of music that Keef might be making if he was interested in recording a proper follow-up to <i>Finally Rich</i> rather than burrowing deeper into his own insular world.</p>
<p>In other words: anthems abound here. Whether it's the Zaytoven-esque funhouse mirror trap of ""Styles"", on which SD stretches out vowels about as far as vowels can be stretched, or the gargantuan bruiser ""Circles"", where his singsong melodies fold in on themselves, eating their own tails in a game of musical Ouroboros, SD knows how to key in on one particular element in a song and then spend four minutes exploring it from every possible angle. Take ""Clockwork"", for instance, where he borrows inspiration from the tick-tock heave of Sonny Digital and B Wheezy's production without running the track's central conceit (""What time is it? Go get some money"") into the ground.</p>
<p>Even with his penchant for selecting tough-as-nails production, <i>Truly Blessed</i> is rarely a heavy affair. The narrative around drill often claims that those who make it are dead-eyed goons, nihilists who not only perpetuate the violence that plagues their city but actually glorify it. This conveniently avoids admitting that, while a lot of drill is unrelentingly bleak (see: most of Lil Durk's oeuvre), there's a lot of humor and outright joy to be found in it as well—SD isn't the natural class clown that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30015-king-louie/"">King Louie</a> is, but he may be drill's most natural lothario. The most infectious moments on <i>Truly Blessed</i> are its giddiest, and a few of them also happen to be honest-to-God—and really good—love songs.</p>
<p>""I want the best of you, don't worry 'bout tonight"" SD sing-raps on ""Big Things"", which captures the dizzying swirl of being completely and entirely head-over-heels about someone. It's also a shimmering swath of Lite-Brite synths that still possesses a lower-end that could knock pictures off of walls. ""I Do"" might be even better—SD sells the song by committing fully to its starry-eyed ecstasy, and it may very well contain the most sunlight a drill song has ever dared to let in. ""This money saved me"" claims SD at one point on <i>Truly Blessed</i>, but the 15 songs here make a compelling argument that changing ""money"" to ""music"" wouldn't make his statement one iota less accurate.</p></div>"|20041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20041-sd-truly-blessed/|7.3|Renato Pagnani

There was a clean-cut finality to the proceedings, a sense that the group was sending off a movement that had finally run its course. Producer and de facto group leader RZA thought he’d get the guys together for one last job and spent the year trying to will a new Wu-Tang album into existence in time for <i>36 Chambers</i>’ November anniversary. The date came and went, but no album surfaced (though we did get ""Family Reunion"", a sentimental homecoming over a perhaps-too-chunky slice of the O’Jays’ 1975 hit of the same name). Work was plagued by old complaints about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"">RZA</a>’s lush live band arrangements flying in the face of the claustrophobic kung fu grit of the Clan’s classics. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"">Raekwon</a> publicly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54422-raekwon-talks-disapproval-of-wu-tang-clans-20th-anniversary-album/"">challenged RZA’s authority</a> and boycotted the sessions. The new album had a name (<i>A Better Tomorrow</i>, after the emotional <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziQ9SXz9diA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Wu-Tang Forever</i> cut</a>) but no fully functioning group to record it.</p>
<p>Tense negotiations and a reconciliation followed, but <i>A Better Tomorrow</i> arrives this week illuminating the early apprehensions. The production here is more of a piece with the muscular <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ8Gtx45Fmc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtrack work</a> of RZA’s 2012 directorial debut <i>The Man With the Iron Fists</i> than anything bearing the Wu-Tang name, barring the heavily orchestrated bits of 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10975-8-diagrams/""><i>8 Diagrams</i></a> that inspired Raekwon’s last mutiny attempt. But <i>A Better Tomorrow</i>’s thick and moody soundscapes run off-puttingly perpendicular to the group’s cerebral storytelling. ""Felt"" practically drowns memorable turns from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"">Ghostface Killah</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7846-method-man/"">Method Man</a> in unnecessary drum-n-bass flourishes. Inspectah Deck and Cappadonna come off uncharacteristically plodding over the fluid, proggy groove of ""Mistaken Identity"". Sounds that were once punishing, tumbling out of shoddy recording equipment in a home studio, are distractingly pretty, pumped full of all the crack session playing <i>A Better Tomorrow</i> favors.</p>
<p>Where overbearing arrangements don’t get in the way, a cloying sentimentality does. 4th Disciple delivers one of the album’s better productions with ""Miracle"", but a drippy, beatless chorus and melodramatic coda hack the momentum out from under suspenseful verses. ""Felt"" nicks a chorus from the mawkish '70s weeper ""Feelings"", and the hokey, swinging <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5038-dusty-springfield/"">Dusty Springfield</a> homage of ""Preacher’s Daughter"" is only listenable for Meth and Ghost’s flexible senses of humor. The title track fits the methodical build of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HhV3Slqtvw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wake Up Everybody""</a> under suitably socially conscious verses, but right as you start to hope they’re not just going to play the actual chorus of the original in full, they do, strings ramped noxiously high in the mix. By the time ""Family Reunion"" hits, <i>A Better Tomorrow</i> will have felt more like a karaoke bar’s old school night than a new album by the guys who gave us ""C.R.E.A.M."" and ""Triumph"".</p>
<p>When <i>A Better Tomorrow</i> commits to sounding like an actual Wu-Tang affair it starts to cook. Longtime Wu associate Mathematics brings Meth and GZA to life with a lively soul chop on the album’s lead single ""Keep Watch"" and imbues ""40th Street Black/We Will Fight"" with the spirit of <i>The</i> <i>W</i>’s upbeat but by no means peppy ""Gravel Pit"". ""Pioneer the Frontier"" fashions the energy of ramshackle <i>W</i> deep cut ""Careful (Click, Click)"" into a menace RZA can’t even kill when he signs verse one off with ""Holla at the moon, my goons at Coachella."" ""Necklace"" and ""Ron O’Neal"" follow suit in piling on the soot, and for a moment, this thing is heavy enough to bear the weight of the name on the cover. But all too often, <i>A Better Tomorrow</i> prefers to bask in those idyllic blue skies instead.</p>
<p>Raekwon was right: RZA’s vision no longer suits the rabid, renegade spirit the Wu-Tang Clan represents. He’s helmed a record that’s drunk on its own musicality, one that seems to befuddle the very guys rapping on it. It’s impossible to say how engaged the rest of the members were in recording, whether the wonkier moments here are the result of rappers disinterested in their own beats or production crafted awkwardly around pre-existing verses. But it’s deeply telling that the night the Wu-Tang Clan was set to release its first album in seven years (and possibly, its last one ever), Raekwon was already pushing <a href=""https://twitter.com/Raekwon/status/539603617255546883"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">something else entirely</a> on Twitter. The union hasn’t worked in a while, and rather than hiding irreparable fissures by posting up a unified front to tickle fan nostalgia, better to let it crystallize unblemished in memory. Keep up appearances for the kids if you like, but trust and believe that they can tell when something is off.</p></div>"|20043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20043-wu-tang-clan-a-better-tomorrow/|5.9|Craig Jenkins

""The basic metaphor is that of the north and south of a person is a projection of the north and south of the globe,"" the composer, improviser, and trumpet player, now 77, explained in an <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/16268-jon-hassell"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> earlier this year. ""A mind formatted by language and located in the head, compared with the area of wildness and sensuality below the waist where dance and music and procreation reigns.""</p>
<p>However, the first time through, <i>Possible Musics</i>—which Hassell created in 1980 in collaboration with producer Brian Eno—you might find that ""wildness"" and ""sensuality"" are not the first adjectives that come to mind. It is eerie, dreamlike, and otherworldly music.</p>
<p>Throughout the record, Hassell’s trumpet is processed using a harmonizer effect, producing alien tonalities that seem to slide between the notes of a traditional Western scale. Often, his melody lines sound more like a human voice than a brass instrument. The rhythm tracks—made up of hand percussion and electric bass—are highly repetitive, but also wobbly and destabilized. The result is a sound that melds minimalism, jazz, and ambient sounds, but doesn’t fit comfortably into any of those genres.</p>
<p>Though his name is not invoked as frequently as Eno’s, the last few decades have proven Hassell—who was born in Memphis, Tennessee—to be an influential presence in electronic music and modern composition. Active since the mid-'60s, his background is hard to duplicate. He studied with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, played on the first recording of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>’s ""In C"", and has performed session work for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a>. His solo work has provided the sonic blueprint for a number of contemporary musicians, as well, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> (See <i>Selected Ambient Works Vol. II)</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/""><i>Returnal</i></a>) to name a few.</p>
<p><i>Possible Musics</i> was, in a lot of ways, the first full realization of Hassell's Fourth World concept. Many of the sounds—the freaky trumpet tones, the drifting ambient structures—were already in place on his 1977 debut LP, <i>Vernal Equinox</i>, but while that album is as meditative and mesmerizing as anything he has released, it is clearly identifiable as a jazz fusion record.</p>
<p>On <i>Possible Musics</i>, synthesizers and electronic treatments help to nudge things into less recognizable territory. The music is informed by minimalism, but Hassell's take is very different than the works of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a> that are linked to that style. For those composers, minimalism often involved rigorous structure and clockwork execution, whereas <i>Possible Musics</i> is conceptually dialed in, but loose and improvisational in its execution. Harmonic motion is limited and all attention is centered around the embellishment of a single melodic line. Hassell is playing lead on these songs, but his performances often blur seamlessly into the backing tracks.</p>
<p>Like Eno’s ambient records, <i>Possible Music </i>is all about mood. However, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/""><i>Music For Airports</i></a> sought to reflect a highly impersonal environment, Hassell’s work is intentionally exotic. No specific nation or people is being quoted here, though. Hassell's landscape is an invented one—an imagined culture, where high technology and mysticism are blended together. ""John’s experiment was to imagine a 'coffee coloured' world,"" explains Eno in an essay first published in <i><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/09/jazz.urban"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Guardian</a></i> and excerpted for the reissue's liner notes. ""A globalized world constantly integrating and hybridizing, where differences were celebrated and dignified—and realize it into music.""</p>
<p>In this sense, <i>Possible Musics </i>is an exercise in science fiction. Like the William Gibson book <i>Neuromancer</i>, the record offered an imperfect, but prescient glimpse toward the near future.  The subsequent decades have not produced much music like Hassell’s, but the concepts that informed <i>Possible Musics</i> have proven predictive of the way that technology would come to mesh with music-making in other cultures—whether that’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2384-konono-n1/"">Konono N°1</a>'s amplified thumb pianos, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27817-group-doueh-and-omar-souleyman/"">Group Doueh</a>’s electric guitars, or any number of global electronic and pop sounds that have been produced using a laptop computer.</p>
<p>And once you acclimate to the weird and warbly tones, there <i>is</i> a certain sensuality to <i>Possible Musics</i>. In Hassell’s desire to crossbreed cultures there’s an implicit act of intercourse going on—a desire for personal renewal and transformation via an ""other"", be it a nation, culture, or another human being.</p></div>"|19984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19984-brian-eno-jon-hassel-fourth-world-vol-1-possible-musics/|8.5|Aaron Leitko

The Mississippi rapper/producer was as Southern as it’s possible to be, with a deep drawl that could suddenly accelerate like a souped-up caddie. His topics of choice were car culture, faith, and music-making, and he created rousing anthems celebrating those subjects. He played the role of local boy made good at a time when the Internet was thought to be dissolving the idea of what ""local"" meant.</p>
<p>""I apologize if I’m oh-so-old fashioned"" he raps during ""Third Eye"" from his new album, <i>Cadillactica, </i>and at this point, the remark can be taken in multiple ways. In the context of the song, K.R.I.T. is calling himself old school, but he’s also the kind of self-producing Southern rapper who was put on by his catalogue, as opposed to a single infectious single—no <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-hq_CHNH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Versace""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2cQSPRTdhg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No Flex Zone""</a> for him. Instead, blogs vaunted his debut mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14285-krit-wuz-here/""><i>K.R.I.T. Wuz Here</i></a> and he remains an album rapper at a time when albums are less important than ever.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Cadillactica, </i>K.R.I.T. acknowledges that the music he makes is no longer quite as relevant as it was just a couple of years ago. The title track includes a less-than subtle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a> reference, and on ""King of the South"", the rapper specifies that he works for the OG’s rather than the ""blogspot comment box."" The most noteworthy testament to K.R.I.T.’s attitude about developments in hip-hop comes in the furious ""Mt. Olympus"", the best response to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15861-big-sean-control-hof-ft-kendrick-lamar-and-jay-electronica/"">Kendrick’s ""Control"" verse</a> that you may not have heard yet, perhaps because it wasn’t recorded over the same beat. The song is almost worth quoting in its entirety, because no track more perfectly sets up the problem for an old-fashioned ""lyrical"" Southern rapper at a time when Southern rap is best known for catchphrases, singles, and forward-thinking production. K.R.I.T.’s anger on the track is stirring and his flow about eight times more impressive than you probably remember. But the fact that his ire is directed at ""swagger-jackers"" who popularized Southern sounds and slang is disconcerting, evidence of an artistic conservatism that may be what’s kept the rapper on a plateau for his last few projects.</p>
<p>Even if <i>Cadillactica </i>may look to some like an artist struggling to stretch, it certainly feels like the quintessence of the sound that K.R.I.T. has been working toward. On tracks like ""Kreation"" and ""Mind Control"", there’s deep maximalist Southern funk reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7749-big-boi/"">Big Boi</a>’s musical backdrop on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/""><i>Speakerboxxx </i></a>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14424-sir-lucious-left-foot-the-son-of-chico-dusty/"">Sir Lucious Leftfoot</a>. </i>The efficacy of ""My Sub: Part 3"" will depend on how capable the bass in your earphones or stereo is, but it’s a fitting peak for a rapper who has ""thought about the thump from the jump."" (After all, ""hos can’t twerk to the hi-hat, never."") The album is filled with the kind of soul-infused hip/hop that's been missing from the genre. ""Soul Food"", featuring the immortal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14945-raphael-saadiq/"">Raphael Saadiq</a> and ""Saturdays=Celebration"" are resurrections of a neglected art form; the way that they’re executed makes you wonder why more people aren’t making music like this.</p>
<p>K.R.I.T. is such a gifted storyteller that he’s often able to transcend the hackneyed concepts from which his songs are built. Take ""Third Eye"", where his skeezy, new-age come-on somehow morphs into a seductive (and wholly club-inappropriate) vision of creating a family: ""Picket fences, and chilling playing instruments…I saw your face, you were full of Grace, at least that’s what we named her/ My angel had an angel and I was so thankful."" Another song that deals with ""Angels"" (and features the unfortunate hook, ""I think angels get high"") has an amazing moment where K.R.I.T. describes his friend’s fear of an apocalyptic storm in such specific detail that you remember your own fear when encountering something so elemental.</p>
<p>At this point in K.R.I.T.'s career, we have a clear idea of his limitations—and with a runtime nearly reaching an hour, the 17 tracks here can’t help but magnify some of the rapper’s flaws. There are empty songs on <i>Cadillactica; ""</i>Lost Generation"", which features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1657-lupe-fiasco/"">Lupe Fiasco</a>, has the rappers encouraging each other’s pedantic tendencies.<i> </i>K.R.I.T., too, will often lay back and let his production cover a shallow 16—""Mind Control"" is one of the best sounding songs on the record, but its verses, including features from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"">E-40</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa"">Wiz Khalifa</a>, don’t do much to elevate the track.</p>
<p>And yet, like a basketball star managing to score within a wholly antiquated offense, <i>Cadillactica</i> is the triumph of a style that has all but been discarded. It’s no doubt a conservative record, maybe even a deeply unfashionable one, but much of its strength lies in the fact that it sounds different from everyone else out there. K.R.I.T.’s stubborn resolution to stick to perfecting one particular approach may eventually doom his growth, and it would be nice to see him move in a new direction at some point. But the power of <i>Cadillactica</i> repudiates the need for a change of pace—why trade in an old, reliable car when it still rides so clean?</p></div>"|20029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20029-big-krit-cadillactica/|7.5|Jonah Bromwich

Maybe it was a little <i>too </i>influential—because now that <i>Slaughter</i>’s ""will-it-ever-come?"" follow-up, <i>At War With Reality</i>, has arrived, it’s got a big cross to bear. The Gothenburg death-metal titans have reconvened at a time when their precise, abrasively melodic sound has been repurposed—and <i>re</i>-repurposed—by about a zillion mediocre melodeath and metalcore outfits. That shouldn’t have any bearing on <i>At War With Reality</i>, but it does: Any seminal band that resurfaces after so long an absence are prone to be called on the carpet not only for their own accomplishments, but for the zeitgeist they’ve unleashed, better or worse. Luckily for At the Gates, they don’t seem to care one way or the other. Though maybe they should have.</p>
<p>Heavy bands making stunning comebacks has become nearly routine over the past few years; look no further than Amebix’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs5YwTsNX3o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sonic Mass</i></a>, Carcass’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18360-carcass-surgical-steel/""><i>Surgical Steel</i></a>, or Godflesh’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19896-godflesh-a-world-lit-only-by-fire/""><i>A World Lit Only by Fire</i></a>. At the Gates have earned a spot on the ladder, but on a lower rung; <i>At War With Reality</i> is crisp, concise, and tastefully technical, but it isn’t tear-your-head-off incredible. The production, for one, is miles better, with a fuller, fleshier attack, and frontman Tomas Lindberg’s feral rasp has been coarsened even more by his tenure with his resurrected d-beat group <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmbmF49Xqe0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Disfear</a>. On ""Order from Chaos"", a simmering, tribal rhythm augments his apparent attempt to throw up his own lungs; lead guitarist Anders Björler installs atmospheric melodies and nearly gothic arpeggios. It’s one of the few glimpses of dynamism to the album. Mostly it sticks to a clipped, cold, chunky groove that might as well be a melodeath plug-in.</p>
<p>The lack of highs and lows aside, <i>At War With Reality </i>sticks to a solidly savage middle. ""Eater of Gods"" and ""The Conspiracy of the Blind"" are meaty, marauding, and righteously irate. Too bad they’re also practically interchangeable. At times, they sound more like the Haunted, the long-running outfit that’s been a halfway house of sorts to various members of At the Gates following their 1996 breakup. That’s not always a good thing, as the Haunted ran out of steam and ideas years ago; <i>At War With Reality</i> tracks like ""Heroes and Tombs"" seethe and shred, but they might as well be Haunted tunes with a few more flourishes (and a lot less cartoonishness). At a time when At the Gates should be doing everything it can to set itself apart from the pack, it’s leaned on the most obvious—and most insular—signifiers imaginable.</p>
<p><i>At War With Reality</i> unquestionably rocks with fury and passion, and that’s its saving grace. What doesn’t work is the album’s concept—in essence, an homage to the elliptical, magic-realist short stories of Jorge Luis Borges. Basically, the concept involves shuffling around various Borges motifs—labyrinths, mirrors, mysterious cities—and making a patchwork of them. It’s a shallow approach to one of literature’s greatest writers, and while Lindberg should get credit for not, say, being yet another metal band singing about H. P. Lovecraft, the opportunity to rise above feels squandered. Not only does Lindberg directly, lazily lift the titles of two Borges stories wholesale—for the songs ""The Circular Ruin"" and ""The Book of Sand""—the music doesn’t in any way connect with or evoke the otherworldliness of the author’s work (aside from the shadowy, sumptuous instrumental ""City of Mirrors""). It’s funny that one of Borges’ primary themes is self-reference—because <i>At War With Reality</i> is, above all else, an At the Gates album that feels like a pastiche of At the Gates. At least it’s a spirited one.</p></div>"|20022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20022-at-the-gates-at-war-with-reality/|6.9|Jason Heller

In the design, Full of Hell appropriated the album art of Merzbow’s 1996 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11778-pulse-demon-animal-magnetism/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pulse Demon</i></a>, a pulsing visual that works as a testament to the hypnotic waves of that collection. Depending on your opinion of Full of Hell, you’d either call it a tribute or a ripoff. Either way, rarely do shirts lead to actual collaboration, something that came about here when the band met Balázs Pándi—who’s served as Merzbow’s drummer as of late—while on tour in Europe.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Combining noise and metal is a worthwhile pursuit, with groups like Portland’s Knelt Rote and Toronto’s Column of Heaven synthesizing noise’s freer destruction with metal’s more structured attack. In fact, both genres seems to be reversing roles—many of the more critically acclaimed noise records, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"">Wolf Eyes</a>’ 2004 breakout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8730-burned-mind/""><i>Burned Mind</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31210-pharmakon/"">Pharmakon</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19871-pharmakon-bestial-burden/""><i>Bestial Burden</i></a>, are praised for incorporating structure, while the more extreme ends of black and death metal are rapidly becoming looser and more feral. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32192-impetuous-ritual/"">Impetuous Ritual</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19191-impetuous-ritual-unholy-congregation-of-hypocritical-ambivalence/""><i>Unholy Congregation Of Hypocritical Ambivalence</i></a>, from earlier in the year, is a prime example.) Merzbow is no stranger to metal, having released several albums with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/620-boris/"">Boris</a>, contributed to two songs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7578-flight-of-the-behemoth/""><i>Flight of the Behemoth</i></a>, and has cited death metal as influence on 1994’s <i>Venereology</i>, released through the since-shuttered <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Relapse</a> sub-label Release Entertainment. This collaboration, however, is frustrating because it falls short of its goals, in part due to Merzbow’s too-reduced role and that Full of Hell don’t make up for the missing space.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Burst Synapse"" begins with a quick rush of powerviolence, an even quicker patch of Merzbow’s static, then continues to be dominated by Full of Hell’s rote playing. ""Gordian Knot"" and ""Humming Miter"" offend more in this matter, where Merzbow feels squandered. He doesn’t get to show any of his strengths. Full of Hell are one of those bands that can get people moshing in clubs, but can’t capture that intensity in the studio, and it’s more than obvious here. Merzbow isn’t quite able to bolster their riffs, unlike in </span><i>Rock Dream</i><span>, where he helps make Boris’ riffs grand and ecstatic. For his reputation as the antithesis of music, Merzbow has a strong command of rhythm, and if Full of Hell are gonna use </span><i>Demon</i><span>'s art to gas up their van, they should have embraced that record’s dynamics, not simply its textures. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Some potential arises toward the album’s conclusion, where Merzbow begins to sync with Full of Hell. The blastbeats of ""Mute"" feel more unhinged thanks to his noise, for once, overcoming the guitar. ""High Fells"" sees Full of Hell dooming out, and in the process, giving Merzbow more room to cast a wide shadow. There’s even saxophone on here, and in closer ""Fawn Heads and Unjoy"", which is not only a nod to Merzbow’s love of free jazz, but also lends unpredictability. Full of Hell restrain themselves even more on ""Ludjet Av Gud"", dominated by booming floor toms and drifting noise undercurrents. (Some editions of the album come with </span><i>Sister Fawn</i><span>, a bonus disc of outtakes. They’re long jams of noise and drums, and even if they don’t form a cohesive whole, they’re a much more satisfying listen than the actual record.)<br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the end here, Merzbow feels more like a over-hyped, under-trotted guest. It doesn’t even have the muster to serve as a compelling entryway for hardcore kids to get into noise. (As great as </span><i>Demon</i><span> and </span><i>Venereology </i><span>are, they may be a bit overwhelming for novices; Merzbow’s collaborations with Boris would be smoother introductions.)

And for many get-in-the-van vets, it was a transition that necessitated a clean-slate reboot, whether it was Lou Barlow channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a>’s roar into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3733-sebadoh/"">Sebadoh</a>’s trembling whispers, Jon Spencer reshaping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9569-pussy-galore/"">Pussy Galore</a>’s skronk into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2205-the-jon-spencer-blues-explosion/"">Blues Explosion</a>’s funk, or Davids Yow and Sims harnessing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6194-scratch-acid/"">Scratch Acid</a>’s strangulated squeals into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">Jesus Lizard</a>’s militaristic might. But for Yo La Tengo co-founders/cohabitants Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley, the ascent to the Amerindie frontlines was a more gradual, unceremonious process, one that involved downsizing their band from a quartet to a trio, jumping from label to label, and a chronic inability to hold onto a bassist for more than one album at a time. Where they began as a prototypical college-rock outfit in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvets</a>-via-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies"">Feelies</a> mould (with an unabashed soft spot for '60s-pop covers), Yo La Tengo would go on to define '90s indie—and its evermore sophisticated post-millenial permutations—not by refining their sound, but by blowing it wide open. <i>Painful</i> was the moment of detonation.</p>
<p>The importance of <i>Painful</i> to the Yo La Tengo narrative can be gauged as such: This year marks the band’s 30th anniversary, and they’re celebrating it by reissuing their sixth album, released nearly a decade into their career. <i>Painful</i> marked a couple of significant firsts for Yo La Tengo: it was their first album made with eventual long-time producer Roger Moutenot, and their first to be issued through <a href=""http://www.matadorrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matador Records</a>, whose post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> popularity (and resultant <a href=""http://www.atlanticrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atlantic Records</a> parternship) afforded the band their widest distribution yet. And though <i>Painful</i> was actually the second Yo La Tengo album to feature bassist James McNew, it was the first to fully enmesh his sensibilities with Kaplan and Hubley’s, shirking the typical new-guy/third-wheel dynamic for a more polyamorous professional relationship that continues to this day.</p>
<p>As recently as 1992’s <i>May I Sing With Me </i>(McNew’s debut with the band), Yo La Tengo albums tended to slide back and forth between narcotic noise-pop and hushed folky balladry, producing music that was unerringly charming and consistent if not exactly transcendental. But with the introductory organ hum of the prophetically titled ""Big Day Coming"", Yo La Tengo’s musical universe instantly turned three-dimensional, projecting a vastness their previous records never really approached; by the time they kick into the dizzying tremoloed groove of the following ""From a Motel 6"", you can already hear their hearts beating as one. Remarkably, <i>Painful</i> thoroughly expanded Yo La Tengo’s sound by emphasizing two basic ingredients: a little shaker here, and a lot of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Tone#Electronic_Keyboards"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ace Tone</a> there (a development so notable, it even earns its own celebratory rock-out in ""Sudden Organ""). But taken together, they temper the band’s once-scrappy vigor into hypnotic motorik motions and droning reverberations, while casting Hubley’s plainspoken vocals in a dreamy haze, and inspiring Kaplan to drop the bratty insolence of old for a more congenially conversational drawl.</p>
<p>The cardigan-cozy sound of the record effectively established Yo La Tengo as indie rock’s great romantics. Though musical-cum-matrimonial partnerships weren’t exactly a novelty at the time (see: Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore, Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema, Jon Spencer and Cristina Martinez), Kaplan and Hubley were the rare pair to use their songs to openly address matters of the heart. But while Kaplan and Hubley’s exchanges on <i>Painful</i> can resemble scenes from a marriage, it’s not necessarily their own; rather, a hazy-headed ballad like ""Nowhere Near"" conveys both an intimacy and non-specificity that make it applicable to any long-distance relationship spent waiting for the phone to ring. And the album’s most tender moment—with Kaplan crooning ""baby, I’m in love with you"" like a lonesome doo-wop singer abandoned by his crew on some moonlit corner—comes through a to-die-for cover of UK power-popsters the Only Ones’ ""The Whole of the Law"" (yet another sterling example of Yo La Tengo acting out their record collection). Even <i>Painful</i>’s most blown-out moments are infused with an unspeakable tenderness—Yo La Tengo were no strangers to extended, feedback-screeching jams at this point, but never before had they pulled one off that could actually make you weep (""I Heard You Looking"").</p>
<p>What makes <i>Painful</i> so eminently approachable after all these years is that it manages to sound like a fully realized, band-defining statement yet unpretentiously off-the-cuff at the same time. It’s a feeling reinforced by the overflow of material available on this reissue, appropriately retitled <i>Extra Painful</i> on account of its enlarged 2xCD girth (not to mention an additional album’s worth of download-only odds and ends even more revelatory than the bonus disc proper). More so than any other band in recent memory, Yo La Tengo’s body of work hinges on the notion that no song is ever a completely finished, end-state product; what we hear on any given album is seemingly a function of what mood they were in the day it was recorded, what the weather was like on the day of mixing, or how much studio time was left before the budget was blown. There is no such thing as a permanent record; songs have many lives before they’re officially documented and continue to evolve long thereafter.</p>
<p>It’s a concept that Yo La Tengo had hinted at before with the two oppositional treatments of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu-HeyvbMoQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Evil That Men Do""</a> on 1989’s <i>President Yo La Tengo</i> and the double, duelling dose of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_QO8y42OYQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Upside-Down""</a> on the 1992 EP of the same name. <i>Painful</i> continued the conversation with dramatically different versions of Kaplan’s ""Big Day Coming""—the gauzy, weightless opener and the penultimate, fuzzed-out chugger—but <i>Extra Painful</i> ups the ante with three more wildly varying live mutations: a laid-back acoustic take sung by Hubley, a revved-up rendition that’s almost twice as fast as the second <i>Painful</i> one, and a mammoth 19-minute distention that fills in the canyon-like divide between Yo La’s soothing/squalling extremes. Likewise, a percussion- and fuzz-free CBGB performance of ""Double Dare"" foregrounds the pent-up longing that gets washed over by the original’s shoegazey drive, while an Ace Tone-free demo of the same underscores just how important the organ was in achieving it. And it speaks volumes about <i>Painful</i>’s superior quality—and the band’s surging creative energies at the time—that the steely, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">Stooges</a>-inspired stomper ""Shaker"" could be earmarked for a non-album single, while the spectacular slow-dissolve ballad ""Slow Learner"" would be shelved altogether.</p>
<p>From this point on, Yo La Tengo could no longer be described as mere Velvet Underground wannabes (unless, of course, they were <a href=""http://antietamtheband.com/ATB%20PICTURES/rad5full.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">playing them in a movie</a>), and within just a few years, you’d be <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBJdufFnEnQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hard-pressed to even call them a rock band anymore</a>. But then, such a free-ranging future seemed almost predestined when, after a decade of playing the rock'n'roll classicist, Kaplan opened up <i>Painful</i> by declaring, ""let’s be undecided."" As Yo La Tengo’s post-<i>Painful </i>path would prove, indecision has never sounded so assured.</p></div>"|20017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20017-yo-la-tengo-extra-painful/|9.6|Stuart Berman

So it was hardly surprising when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"">M. Ward</a> and Zooey Deschanel announced that their next release would be <i>Classics</i>, a cover album of 13 of their favorite old-school songs.</p>
<p>So, what makes a classic song? For She &amp; Him, classic songs find their roots in country, soul, and jazz orthodoxy, and they’re culled from the eras in which these genres were arguably the most golden—the '30s, the '50s, the '70s. Clearly, a classic song is a love song. From Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong’s flirtatious duet <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqRvawY3TQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Would You Like to Take a Walk?""</a> to Johnny Mathis’ sadly hopeful <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7xyAM7uF6I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's Not for Me to Say""</a>, She &amp; Him tuck a wide range of romantic ups and downs into this starry-eyed and glamorous little record.</p>
<p>She &amp; Him aren’t trying to surprise anyone with these covers; there’s no off-the wall instrumental experimentation, no dramatic shift in lyrics. Instead, <i>Classics</i> is charming and sleepy in a '60s samba sort of way, filled with whispering percussion, light electric guitar solos, and string arrangements worthy of the silver screen. ""This Girl’s in Love With You"", a slight twist on Herb Alpert’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8ByJ1C0iR4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Guy’s in Love With You""</a>, is highly reminiscent of the original, with a retro brass and woodwind arrangement. It would make delightful title music if Deschanel ever wants to star in a version of ""New Girl"" set in the mid-'70s.</p>
<p>Even when She &amp; Him push their sonic boundaries a little, the effect is still subtle and sophisticated. On ""Teach Me Tonight"", they manage to move the 1954 classic further into the past, painting the soulful tune with a sped-up '30s flare, layering back-up ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" under Deschanel’s lead vocals into a Boswell Sisters-worthy harmony. They take <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrK5u5W8afc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Unchained Melody""</a> to an absolutely haunting place, featuring just Deschanel and Ward’s guitar, her words echoed by a ghostly ensemble choir.</p>
<p>A cinematic quality reverberates throughout <i>Classics</i>, and songs like ""She"", ""Unchained Melody"", and ""We’ll Meet Again"" were featured in or made for series or films. The songs themselves play like romantic mini-dramas, with pleas for lovers to stay and odes to loneliness. That said, some narratives call for a singer with more force. While Maxine Brown and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"">Aretha Franklin</a> belt the chorus of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7iuI9Dssig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oh No, Not My Baby""</a> in a gesture of soulful refusal, Deschanel opts for tender restraint, so that the song’s metaphoric head-shaking suddenly becomes a limply apathetic shrug. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5038-dusty-springfield/"">Dusty Springfield</a>’s jangling <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMcRQ-Ur1ko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stay Awhile""</a> is muted considerably in She &amp; Him’s rendition, as Deschanel’s voice takes a somber turn.</p>
<p>Even though they're working with dated lyricism by 2014’s standards, saccharine lines like ""When you’re strolling through the wherezis, you need a whozis to lean upon"" don’t sound contrived or silly in She &amp; Him's hands. ""Funny, each time I fall in love,"" Deschanel sings on Bing Crosby’s hit, ""It’s always you."" If <i>Classics</i> proves anything, it’s that these songs stick around for a reason.</p></div>"|20033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20033-she-him-classics/|6.6|Hazel Cills

A former member of the influential, similarly release-happy experimental trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a>, his music has retained a distinct and idiosyncratic feel even as his compositions have become increasingly ambitious and dense. It begins with his guitar work, which is always texturally rich and recognizable for its tone even though his playing is widely varied. He can send out layer after layer of simple and easily melodic patterns, making them overlap and flutter like hummingbird wings; he’s unafraid to top all of those intricately constructed layers with a meat-and-potatoes solo that wouldn’t be out of place on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23338-journey/"">Journey</a> song. This skill has remained the core of his songs from his earliest CD-Rs all the way through to epic multi-instrumental efforts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18939-mark-mcguire-along-the-way/""><i>Along the Way</i></a>, a full-length released earlier this year.</p>
<p>There’s a consistent emotional aspect to McGuire’s work that’s just as important as his fretplay. He’s an earnest and unabashedly sentimental composer, whether exploring his youth and family (on his first prominent full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14758-living-with-yourself/""><i>Living With Yourself</i></a>) or plumbing philosophical depths and metaphysical questions on <i>Along the Way</i>. There’s a gentle, searching quality to the length and slow expansion of his songs, and to his infrequent vocals. His new EP, <i>Noctilucence</i>, is more of the same: named for a bright, bold, and rare cloud phenomena, it finds McGuire further expanding his sonic palette.</p>
<p>There are moments on <i>Noctilucence</i> where McGuire's steps toward a more complicated strain of composition are palpable. Take a song like ""Entity (Presence)"", one of the shorter tracks on the EP at only six minutes in length: it begins with the sort of chugging, easily layered lines that have formed the base of hundreds of McGuire's songs over the last half-decade. Within a few seconds, it breaks open and reveals a pulsing drum machine and waves of chirping synths; those layers of guitar are still present, but they're buried under dozens of other elements by the time the song is finished. This constant building grants each song on <i>Noctilucence</i> an impressive depth, something that's particularly noticeable on the album's pair of 10-plus minute titans, ""Noctilucence"" and ""Astral Protection""; in the middle of them, I find myself remembering that McGuire once released an EP called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15855-mark-mcguire-get-lost/""><i>Get Lost</i></a>. In trying to summon the size and scale of constellations and galaxies far beyond our current reach, McGuire invites the listener to surrender their directional impulses and cede control; when he deconstructs these songs and slowly strips them down to their humble beginnings towards their conclusions, it feels like reaching the end of a long journey.</p>
<p>While the sheer size and density of McGuire’s work on <i>Noctilucence</i> is certainly impressive, it should be noted that the EP is just a variation on the sort of quest for truth and peace in the maelstrom he’s been conducting for over a half-decade. His methods may have changed, but the end result of his best work remains the same: the loss of your grip on space and time, the release of control. One of my favourite McGuire songs is ""Dream Team"", originally released in 2008 and collected on the phenomenal 2011 compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15420-a-young-persons-guide-to-mark-mcguire/""><i>A Young Person's Guide to Mark McGuire</i></a>. Stretching over 17 minutes, it doesn’t begin to approach the diversity and colour of the material on <i>Noctilucence</i>. It’s a collage of dozens of layers of distorted guitar and some echoing, wordless vocals, one that slowly builds to an impossible crunch before dissipating and drifting away. ""Dream Team"" is simpler, but it’s just as effective. And while it would be reasonable to compare that song and something like ""Noctilucence"" to reach the conclusion that McGuire is reluctant to leave his lane, I choose instead to revel in his singular gift, one he’s slowly and surely exploring.</p></div>"|19988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19988-mark-mcguire-noctilucence-ep/|7.5|Jamieson Cox

For 29-odd minutes, Rachel Aggs (also of Shopping), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1316-electrelane/"">Electrelane</a>'s Ros Murray, and Halo Halo's Rachel Horwood piece the album together, then yank it apart, contorting and complicating these songs at every opportunity. It's 11 calamity-skirting post-punk tunes that teeter between control and chaos.</p>
<p>It's been four years since Trash Kit's self-titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14284-trash-kit/"">debut</a>, a rangier record of distortion-dodging guitars, skittish snares, and head-swimming harmonies. At times, the songs on <i>Trash Kit</i> seemed to be angling for space amidst all the snags and snarls Trash Kit threw at them. On the clearer-headed <i>Confidence</i>, however, the ever-hastening rhythms and countless left-turns provide the framework for the topline melodies to glide over; there's less frenzy here, more co-mingling. A typical Trash Kit song—even the ones that barely scrape the two-minute mark—rarely winds up anywhere near where it started; ""Skin"", the best of the bunch, throws out a springy riff, halfway-flips ""Walk Like an Egyptian"", then suddenly doubles in speed, plunging rollercoaster-style through an anxious array of whoops and shouts. The sound of <i>Confidence</i> is crisp and clean, every note in place, displaying little in the way of post-production; with nothing to hide behind, navigating all these bends and pivots becomes paramount, but Trash Kit seem to take every left-turn and abrupt detour on <i>Confidence</i> with ease, never once having to look down at the map.</p>
<p><i>Confidence</i> is a high-wire act, and maintaining an air of unpredictability in the midst of these tightly-wound songs might be Trash Kit's most impressive feat. Despite the note-perfect presentation, <i>Confidence</i> is loose and limber; hooks seem to emerge from the corners and crevasses of these songs, seemingly forged from the friction caused by all those intersecting parts. Beyond a couple of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/722-james-chance/"">James Chance</a>-ian honkouts from Murray's ex-Electrelane bandmate Verity Susman, these songs are all built from pretty much the same stuff: Aggs' rippling, highlife-inspired fretwork, Murray's cascading basslines, Horwood's frayed-nerve drums, and swooping, meet-you-in-the-middle vocals from the two Rachels. But listening to <i>Confidence</i> is like watching three people put a puzzle back together 11 different ways: the picture changes every time, yet the pieces always seem to fit. <br/><br/>Lyrically, <i>Confidence</i> veers from the wistful to the anxious at the same careening clip as the music; opener ""Beach Babe"" pines for summer, while immediate follower ""Medicine"" begins in ""t-e-r-r-o-r."" ""Teeth"" bows out with ""confidence, all confidence""; seconds later, there's the shakier ""Shyness"", which gets going with ""you're so shy, you should hide."" After a quick pep talk, though, ""Shyness"" takes a turn towards the triumphal, sliding into a major key while Aggs and Horwood gleefully shout down the naysayers. ""Shyness"", like the rest of <i>Confidence, </i>is a testament to casting off the shackles of convention, to not letting anyone (yourself included) stand in the way of what you want.</p></div>"|19995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19995-trash-kit-confidence/|7.4|Paul Thompson

If the name brings to mind one of those innumerable East Coast production duos who vacillated between house and R&amp;B in the early '90s, that’s probably not an accident: Harris and Collins have, over the course of several EPs, pursued the contemplative and melancholic deep house sound developed in New York and New Jersey. It’s the type of music that inevitably gets described as ""sumptuous""; a sound that, with its relaxed tempos and smoky hues, has proven itself equally at home on dance floors and in living rooms.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Harris and Collins both have long histories churning out high energy singles for DJs, but it’s Harris whose solo work has recently taken a turn toward outre composition and lush textures. This year’s well-received <i>Minutes of Sleep</i> was an experiment almost completely untethered from the dance floor, an album whose exceptional clarity allowed Harris and listeners to swim amongst its rich detail. It’s easy to see Harris’ hand in <i>You Go Girl</i>, Frank &amp; Tony’s first album, an album that is far more concerned with the sound of house music than its function.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though the album’s sound is indebted to those deep house classics, it doesn’t share their cultural impact. Those records, crucial in helping carve out spaces for gay and transgender communities, had a socio-political purpose that <i>You Go Girl</i> can’t; instead, the record plays as an exquisite display of deep house’s sound palette, a record on which every sound and gesture is imbued with elegance and purpose.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s a moment in the middle of ""Call Me Rain"" that will be familiar to anyone who’s listened to house music before: a heavy, trudging bass drum is reintroduced after a short passage of heavily-effected electric piano. A few bars latter, a tittering hi-hat and then a clap on the second and fourth beat, splashing down like a boot into a puddle. There is no novelty here; every one of these elements is commonplace, including the structure of the track. What feels unique about Frank &amp; Tony, however, is that these elements aren’t aligned like this to aid a DJ in mixing a track, but rather because this is the ideal presentation for better appreciating these sounds: the cavity the kick drum carves out each time it booms, the crisp landing of the clap, the glittering tinsel of the hi-hats.</p>
<p><i>You Go Girl</i> is an appreciation and a study of sound. The sounds it wants to study happen to be best observed in a 120 bpm deep house track. It’s in this way that Harris and Collins owe a debt to artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"">Matthew Herbert</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4336-terre-thaemlitz/"">Terre Thaemlitz</a> (especially her work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32306-dj-sprinkles/"">DJ Sprinkles</a>), artists with avant-garde roots who have often chosen to contrast their more experimental and sound design impulses with the conventions of house music. (Indeed, the duo collaborated with Thaemlitz for a track on one of three 12''s that accompanies the release of <i>You Go Girl</i>.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>You Go Girl</i> offers a similar richness of detail, its slack tempos gently guiding listeners. They mostly stick to the script: brisk drum, hazy keyboards, a nod-able bassline. Tracks such as ""After Days"" and ""Faded (Dub)"" construct noir-ish atmospheres, imagining a world in which grim detectives nod along on dusky dancefloors. A handful of vocal collaborations—a moody and sour Gry Bagøien on ""Bring the Sun"", a cryptic Jason Poranski on ""Resistance""—offer crucial variety.</p>
<p><i>You Go Girl</i> is a conservative album in every way, asking very little of listeners: if you choose not to stare at the macro details of a bass drum, <i>You Go Girl</i> will fade pleasantly into the background. It doesn’t have the scope or ambition of Thaemlitz’s monumental <i>Midtown 120 Blues</i>, a clear influence. Its instincts are construction, not destruction. The album at times seems like a coloring book in which someone has exclusively drawn inside the lines, but with extreme precision. There’s value in that: these are pretty pictures with a lot of detail, and the care and attention with which they were produced shouldn’t be confused for a lack of passion.</p></div>"|20000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20000-frank-tony-you-go-girl/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

That statement answers a question that Molina left wide open with the release of his 2003 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18704-songs-ohia-the-magnolia-electric-co/""><i>The Magnolia Electric Co.</i></a>, which also became the name of the band that he primarily recorded under for the remainder of his life. It might all seem like so much semantics, but there’s a profound and telling truth behind Molina’s line drawn in the sand: 2002’s <i>Didn’t It Rain</i>, the eighth studio album by his haunting folk-rock project Songs: Ohia, was intended to be an end. </p>
<p>Molina’s music, especially in the wake of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50000-rip-jason-molina/"">death</a>, has taken on an air of myth, but it’s the most unassuming kind of myth imaginable. A trailer-park kid with a garage-sale guitar, he spun his upbringing in Ohio and West Virginia into the stuff of hardscrabble eloquence. He began recording solo under the name Songs: Ohia in the 1990s, at the height of the slicker, more traditional alt-country boom. But rather than kick shit, Molina followed a path parallel to Will Oldham’s: cryptic, fractured, and with the faint, deconstructive underpinning of post-rock. Molina, though, struck closer to full-throated confessionals, even as his eerie guitar tunings and oblique angles of vocal engagement—marks of an autodidactic—kept him squarely sequestered as an outlier.</p>
<p><i>Didn’t It Rain </i>doesn’t veer from the pattern Molina had established by 2002. But it’s a step forward in assurance, while remaining anything but assuring. Recorded live in the studio with a handful of musicians, including <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Krewson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Jim Krewson"">Jim Krewson</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennie_Benford"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Jennie Benford"">Jennie Benford</a> from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2193-jim-and-jennie-and-the-pinetops/"">Jim and Jennie and the Pinetops</a>, the album is a slow sketch in black chalk. The title track is one of Molina’s greatest compositions, full of glistening, suspended chords and a refusal to comfortably resolve. Molina’s narrative perspective is just as uneasy: “No matter how dark the storm gets overhead,” he sings, “They say someone’s watching from the calm at the edge.” Where are we watching from? Who is he supposed to be? The answers aren’t hidden; he doesn’t seem to know. And that slipperiness feeds into the song’s simple, circular swell.</p>
<p>Vocally, Molina reached new heights. Notes dip, quake, and hover. Syllables are either softly stretched or sharply snapped. He harmonizes with Benford in heart-stopping glimpses of intimacy, sounding far more like Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker of slow-core contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a> than any kind of corny ’90s Americana act. If anything, there’s a walloping melancholy that matches Gene Clark at his <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJOR4crL2ws"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Light</a></i> loneliest. “I’m gonna help you all I can,” Molina ultimately offers on “Didn’t It Rain”, but every quiet pocket of emptiness in the song screams that he’s powerless to keep that promise. The song’s title may be borrowed from a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR2gR6SZC2M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gospel traditional</a>, but it isn’t about salvation. It’s about having a hand, <i>any </i>hand, to hold as the inevitable comes crashing down.</p>
<p>Molina was always imagistic, and the piercing hollowness <i>Didn’t It Rain</i> gives him more room than usual to project his nightmares and daydreams. In particular, the moon and the color blue surface repeatedly—not only in the titles “Steve Albini’s Blues”, “Blue Factory Flame”, “Two Blue Lights”, and “Blue Chicago Moon”, but in the way those motifs are worked into the fabric of Molina’s harsh, hushed revelations. The image of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g83L5M_8Nt8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blue moon</a> is one of pop’s most enduring emblems of loneliness, and Molina milks that archetype for all its worth on “Blue Chicago Moon” and “Blue Factory Flame”. They’re the only two tracks played with a full band, but Molina whittles that fullness into a bony vestige; both are creeping and tentative, with picks skidding off strings as if barely willing to activate them.</p>
<p>Cut from the same ragged flannel as Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u5gCiKq9Zc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Danger Bird”</a>—minus the smoldering guitar solos, which Molina wouldn’t begin to incorporate in earnest until Magnolia Electric Co.—“Blue Factory Flame” opens with one of Molina’s most indelible verses, and one that’s become bloodcurdling in the wake of his death: “When I die/ Put my bones in an empty street/ To remind me how it used to be.” But he follows it with a sharp shift to the everyday, a move that mitigates morbid pity with something that almost approaches levity: “Don’t write my name on a stone/ Bring a Coleman lantern and a radio/ The Cleveland game and two fishing poles/ And watch with me from shore.” When, on “Two Blue Lights”, he equates the moon with lights from a late-night bus, all those lunar allusions become ghostly, recursive reflections of each other, a way of amplifying the beauty and dread that Molina never seemed ready to separate. </p>
<p>The moon would also prove to be a looming symbol of austerity and menace on Molina’s next album, <i>Magnolia Electric Co.</i> Here, though, it shines wanly, filtered through a more polluted atmosphere. That’s heard even more clearly on the eight bonus tracks included with the new, deluxe reissue of <i>Didn’t It Rain</i>—six of which represent songs from the album proper, and two of which (“The Gray Tour” and “Spectral Alphabet”) would turn up in different versions on later records. They’re gorgeous, acoustic demo renditions, managing to strip down arrangements that are already skeletal. But they lack the spark of Molina’s in-studio push-and-pull with his handful of collaborators. They do, however, provide an even less guarded portrait of Molina at the time; on the demo version of the self-referential “Cross the Road, Molina”, his pleas to “Set my pulse/ To the Great Lakes pulse” feel almost transcendentally pagan.</p>
<p><i>Didn’t It Rain</i> would be the slow, sad end of Songs: Ohia, but it isn’t a whimper. It’s where Molina felt the need to contract himself to a pinpoint, gathering all his energy into a lonesome quantum, before unleashing the wholehearted force of Magnolia Electric Co. He couldn’t have known what was to come, including some of his best work and worst times, but it’s obvious this is the sound of Molina standing on the brink of something. He didn’t seem to know quite <i>what</i> yet, and that stark uncertainty imbues <i>Didn’t It Rain</i> with a sickening yet heroic alchemy: the ability to make smallness and helplessness feel somehow brave.</p></div>"|19805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19805-songs-ohia-didnt-it-rain/|8.8|Jason Heller

Sure, Mogwai songs are no longer the ticking time-bombs they once were; now as reliant on sci-fi synths as nuclear guitar blasts, their once forbidding 10-minute-plus epics have been pared down to more digestible, pop-friendly forms. But on an album-to-album basis, that change has been so incremental, it can seem like Mogwai have stagnated. While the sneak-attack tactics of old have been replaced with more carefully orchestrated ascents, their music has nonetheless retained the slow-roiling tension and uneasy atmosphere that defined the band’s early efforts.</p>
<p>In lieu of rewriting their formula, Mogwai have instead opted to outsource any radical reinvention to producer friends who don’t so much provide them with remixes as wholesale rethinks. After subjecting their 2011 release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15100-hardcore-will-never-die-but-you-will/""><i>Hardcore Will Never Die But You Will</i></a>, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17374-a-wrenched-virile-lore/"">a nigh-unrecognizable full-album overhaul</a>, the stop-gap <i>Music Industry 3. Fitness Industry 1. </i>EP presents a more modestly scaled counterpart to this year’s <i>Rave Tapes</i>, complementing remixes of three album tracks with a trio of new songs. Collectively, the EP has a little bit of something for every type of Mogwai fan: those who just want them to stick to the same-ol'-same-ol', those who want to see them steer their sound into new directions, and those who’d prefer they dismantle it completely.</p>
<p>EPs have traditionally been the format where Mogwai showcased their more pensive material, so it’s a wonderful shock that <i>Music Industry 3. Fitness Industry 1. </i>leads with the purest, catchiest vocal track the band has ever attempted. Picking up on the motorik momentum first introduced on <i>Hardcore</i>’s “Mexican Grand Prix”, the glimmering dream-pop anthem “Teenage Exorcists” feels very much like a conjuring of Mogwai’s own adolescence, applying My Bloody Valentine’s beautiful blur to Stuart Braithwaite’s dancefloor confession. But while it’d be intriguing at this point to hear Mogwai attempt a whole album in this mode, the EP proves there are limits to their student-disco aspirations: the promisingly titled “HMP Shaun Ryder” proves to be a textbook Mogwai move from ominous, vibraphoned lurch to ape-shit guitarmageddon onslaught, meaning we’ll have to wait just a bit longer for the band to embark upon its baggy phase. (And, alas, “History” offers more of the same, albeit in more pastoral, less dramatic fashion.)</p>
<p>But rather than feel tacked-on incongruities, the three <i>Rave Tapes</i> remixes found on the EP’s second half provide a welcome, unpredictably outré counterpoint to the linear songs heard on the first. In the hands of Blanck Mass—a.k.a. Fuck Buttons co-founder Benjamin John Power—the Italo-prog excursion “Remurdered” is reborn as “Re-Remurdered”, which deploys the original’s synth line not as a melodic motif, but as the rhythmic foundation for its convulsive electro-funk. And tellingly, the other two remixes tackle <i>Rave Tapes</i>’ two meditative closing tracks in sequence, as if Mogwai were admitting that the album’s anti-climactic comedown was in need of a do-over. True to his hauntological m.o., enigmatic producer Pye Corner Audio recasts the oscillating refrain of “No Medicine for Regret” in a ghostly, post-apocalyptic fog, but uses it as the springboard into a light-headed acid-house odyssey, while German composer Nils Frahm reduces the vocoderized ballad “The Lord Is Out of Control” to a gorgeously spare piano melody, before introducing a skyward surge that channels the angelic grace of vintage Sigur Rós. All told, the final score for <i>Music Industry 3. Fitness 1.</i>: Remixers 3 Mogwai 1. </p></div>"|20016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20016-mogwai-music-industry-3-business-industry-1-ep/|6.8|Stuart Berman

The Internet has facilitated links between geographically distant scenes and structurally distinct styles, and it has given fans instant access to the whole sweep of dance music's history. And then there's the food-court model of the contemporary festival, in which attendees can sample a range of styles with relative ease—sometimes, without so much as wandering from one stage to the next.</p>
<p>The budding career of a 23-year-old producer named Henry Steinway is exemplary of this shift in dance music's politics. For a time, he was known principally as Clockwork, a maker of brash, energetic electro-house for labels like Steve Aoki's Dim Mak and Diplo's Mad Decent. Clockwork fit the profile of an EDM main-stager: he <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/clockwork/levels-clockwork-remix-avicii?in=clockwork/sets/rootmusic-bandpage"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bootlegged Avicii's ""Levels""</a>, dealt in crowd-stoking mashups (<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/clockwork/seven-nuke-army-wolfgang?in=clockwork/sets/clockwork-15k-bootleg-pack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wolfgang Gartner's ""Nuke"" with the White Stripes' ""Seven Nation Army""</a>, for instance), and harnessed the usual array of atom-smashing snares, roller-coaster crescendos, and supersonic whoosh. </p>
<p>Around the same time that he first signed to Dim Mak, Steinway began exploring a different sound under the alias RL Grime. Inspired, he has said, by both James Blake and Lex Luger, he set about attempting to connect those worlds with a cat's-cradle of pitched-up vocals, chiming keys, diamond-cutter snares, and clickety-clackety hi-hats. A 2011 mix sketched the outlines of his adopted terrain: Rustie, Untold, and Joy Orbison on the one hand, and Drake, D'Angelo, and Missy Elliott on the other. Recently, RL Grime's profile has risen considerably via his interpretation of ""trap,"" a gruff, swaggering style informed by Southern hip-hop and Dutch hardstyle.</p>
<p>With <i>VOID</i>, his debut album, he's clearly keen to showcase his versatility. Roughly half of the album forsakes trap in favor of various bass-heavy strains of club music or its home-listening variants. It's refreshing to see him unbound by genre strictures, but it can seem like he's trying too hard to please too many people. The opening ""Always"" features a pitch-shifted Janet Jackson sample over moody minor chords and 2-steppy drum programming that invariably bring to mind Four Tet and Burial; it's followed by the Boys Noize co-production ""Danger"", a taut-electro-techno stormer aimed at Boddika's sullen corner of the dance floor.</p>
<p>Both tracks sound like attempts to shore up his underground bona fides, but neither are exactly best-in-class productions, which is a problem that plagues the album: RL Grime may have range, but he doesn't have a terribly original voice. Too many of these feel like items on an imaginary checklist of requirements for any ""serious"" dance album. Pensive scene-setter? Check. Non-beat-gridded ""cosmic"" interlude? Check. Ecstatic drum'n'bass roller? Come and get it! Then there's ""Reminder"", Steinway's contribution to the burgeoning canon of gauzy R&amp;B, complete with guest vocals from How to Dress Well himself. Tom Krell's falsetto is strained and pitchy, and there are points where it might be confused for an ungenerous parody of Bon Iver. Steinway overcompensates by piling on turgid synths, trap hi-hats, and pitch-shifted echoes of Krell's voice run through oodles of reverb. It's a mess. </p>
<p>Steinway sounds far more at home when he's making trap. Had he stuck to his favored lane, in fact, he could have gotten a potent six-track EP out of <i>VOID</i>. ""Core"", with its Middle Eastern reed melody and jump-up vocal refrain, is a veritable earthquake of a tune; it comes on like a .gif of a landslide demolishing a house, over and over—awe-inspiring violence reduced to a few elegant strokes. ""Scylla"", with its <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>-inspired arpeggios and drum'n'bass undercurrents, is busier and maybe even heavier, with horn riffs that could go toe to toe with Hudson Mohawke's gnarliest anthems. </p>
<p>Given that Steinway is still, apparently, making music as Clockwork—his last single under the alias, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/clockwork/signals-clockwork-taylr-renee"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Signals""</a>, came out in July, on Dim Mak, and it sounds like more of a sop to the EDM middle ground than ever—it does seem curious that there's such a wide gulf between that project and the music showcased on <i>Void</i>. In an electronic-music scene distinguished by its blurred lines, and on an album allegedly meant to celebrate the same, why does he continue to compartmentalize? Discussing how his sets vary from city to city, he told <i>Resident Advisor</i>, ""In the UK people may expect different things because they've grown up in a different scene and less of the EDM stuff has come through there. I guess I try to tone down the EDM stuff when I'm in Europe."" The comment, like <i>Void </i>itself, sounds like he's hedging his bets.</p></div>"|20035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20035-rl-grime-void/|5.5|Philip Sherburne

Those authors included the contemporary horror writer Thomas Ligotti (the alleged victim of <i>True Detective</i>’s plagiarism) and Robert W. Chambers, whose 1895 book <i>The King in Yellow</i> is referenced often throughout the show. Naturally, H. P. Lovecraft—whom Chambers influenced and, in turn, who influenced Ligotti—also casts a shadow. Like a squirming colony of worms underneath an overturned rock, that niche literary continuum found itself suddenly thrust into the spotlight. <i>Privacy</i>, the third album by Brooklyn blackened-punk outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30558-raspberry-bulbs/"">Raspberry Bulbs</a>, also draws from that continuum, according to frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9176-raspberry-bulbs/"">Marco del Rio</a>, who began the project as a solo affair following the demise of his black metal duo Bone Awl. There’s nothing novel in that connection; counting the number of rock bands that have cited Lovecraft alone would take ages. But what <i>Privacy </i>does so well, regardless of the listener’s familiarity with del Rio’s cult inspirations, is transpose the intangible dread of Ligotti, Chambers, and Lovecraft into a salvo of cold, sharp jolts to the psyche.<b> </b></p>
<p>Raspberry Bulb’s last album, 2013’s  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30558-raspberry-bulbs/""><i>Deformed Worship</i></a>, was a strong step in this direction, but it also marked the project’s transition into a full band. The no-fi spew of Bone Awl had morphed into a murky howl, and that distance slightly blunted the record’s impact. On <i>Privacy</i>, though, del Rio and company—including Rorschach’s Nicke Forté and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2461-les-savy-fav/"" target=""_blank"">Les Savy Fav</a>’s Andrew Reuland, both on guitar (and reunited two decades after their joint band <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fBStvw_lCQ&amp;list=PLd63rp62Dp0_kp4vn1BjugrDp9O3tituN"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radio to Saturn</a>)—don’t leave an inch of space in which to flinch. “Lionhead” staggers intrepidly into new dimensions of punk ugliness, set at a tempo too fast to be sluggishly grungy and too slow to comfortably mosh to. Forté and Reuland, old partners at guitar interplay, splinter their riffs into each other, leaving a nasty mess everywhere. The fully-rocking instrumental “Nail Biting” doesn’t justify its lack of vocals, but it’s a nerve-jangling exhibition of lacerated harmonics makes del Rio’s absence a little less glaring. But when “Finger Bones,” prickly and abject, gives del Rio room to chew out his own tongue while the band marches over the top of him, his pinpoint application of chaos congeals into a sickening, misanthropic logic.</p>
<p>Del Rio has denied any hint of black-metal allegiance when it comes to Raspberry Bulbs, but there’s no mistaking his blood-gurgling, Quorthon-circa-<i>Under the Sign of the Black Mark </i>grunt-screech, particularly on “Behind the Glass” and “Hopelessly Alive"" which embody an awestruck disgust in the face of grotesque eternity. It’s almost religious, if such a thing as Raspberry Bulbs could be considered a creature of faith. There’s a perverse piety at play on “How the Strings Are Pulled"", a Venom-meets-Negative Approach hymn to debasement and moral powerlessness. When the woah-woah-woahs in the chorus come deliriously close to comprising a pop hook, it seems for a second as if <i>Privacy</i> might pierce its own veil and reveal its squishy humanity. But every time the album builds up a lick of sympathetic momentum, it’s cruelly defused by one of the brief, ambient interludes that break up the proper tracks—six numbered asides constructed of treated noise, distorted spoken-word, strangled strings, and eerie keys that help elevate <i>Privacy</i>’s fractured, labyrinthine torment above <i>Deformed Worship</i>’s more straightforward assault</p>
<p>In <i>The King in Yellow</i>, Chambers writes of “the blackness that surrounds me”—a trite phrase to 21st-century readers, but one that carried far more existential weight in the author’s own time. Is <i>Privacy</i>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17128-raspberry-bulbs-light-surrounds-me/"">“Light Surrounds Me”</a> some kind of response to Chambers? The song itself certainly sounds as if it could be: del Rio slurs its title in spasms of loathing, as if light were twice as horrifying as the alternative. Yet <i>Privacy</i> as a whole is vivid andwide-eyed, with del Rio sounding more swaggeringly confident than ever about his utter lack of confidence. Doubt and fear as cleansing ecstasy: That cognitive dissonance is part of what makes del Rio’s literary antiheroes so cryptically enduring, and it’s what makes <i>Privacy</i> so hideously hypnotic. “Big Grin"", a skeletal, garage-goth dirge that drags its carcass across five unforgiving minutes, feels like del Rio’s ultimate exorcism—only instead of a release, it’s a spiritual implosion. Unlike most bands that seek to probe the notion of a malevolent cosmos, Raspberry Bulbs aren’t trying to cheaply translate cosmic awe into a stomping, grandiose melodrama. <i>Privacy</i> is small, pitiful, tinny, messy, and emaciated, and it dares to demand that mankind doesn’t have the right to feel any differently. When punk stares into the abyss, this is what stares back.</p></div>"|19876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19876-raspberry-bulbs-privacy/|8.2|Jason Heller

<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The respective solo careers of Saloman and Swanson (who dissolved Yellow Swans in 2008) are perhaps attempts to rectify that situation.

For Saloman, body-sound interaction has taken the form of scores created for choreographed dance performances. </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The Disciplined Body </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is his third such work in the past three years, following 2012’s </span><i><a href=""https://gabrielsaloman.bandcamp.com/album/adhere"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adhere</a></i> <span style=""font-size: 15px;"">and 2013’s </span><i><a href=""https://gabrielsaloman.bandcamp.com/album/soldiers-requiem"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soldier’s Requiem</a></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> All three combine tense, driving soundscapes with threads of kinetic narrative. If you didn’t know they were made to accompany dancers, you might guess it anyway; the music is constantly moving, and often in many directions at once.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On Saloman’s previous two albums, he concocted that motion with diverse sounds and styles, using several instruments and noticeable sonic shifts from piece to piece. Both are thematically coherent, but they cover lots of terrain. </span><i>The Disciplined Body</i><span> is more narrowly-focused. It’s a single 35-minute piece stretched across two LP sides, and in some ways it’s a minimalist work. Long tones predominate, and they’re not always dense; in places this is some of the simplest, least-layered sound Saloman has made.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Yet </span><i>The Disciplined Body </i><span>continually builds and escalates, always </span>going<i> somewhere</i><span>. Much of that effect is due to Saloman’s use of percussion, a tool that seems to have particularly caught his fascination since Yellow Swans’ demise. It was especially crucial on </span><i>Soldier’s Requiem</i><span>, whose militaristic drumming and march-like beats evoked the aftermath of war. Percussion is more subtle and sparing on </span><i>The Disciplined Body</i><span>, but it’s just as integral. When it does weave its way into the narrative—particularly in two rattling, snare-roll-heavy sections on side one—its thrust gives Saloman’s ambience a tangibly physical dimension.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In fact, the percussion</span><span> </span><span>is so important that it has an effect even when it’s not there. There’s no discernible beat for the first half of the album’s second side, yet you feel a pulse, a slow wave that rises even when it ebbs. Halfway through, rhythm emerges in a heartbeat-mimicking bass-drum throb. That pushes the surrounding music into determined overdrive, as reflective guitar tones coagulate into miles-deep noise. This compelling climax recalls some of Yellow Swans’ best moments (the majestic “</span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/hybridasoundcloud/mass-mirage-yellow-swans-live"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Mass Mirage</span></a><span>” comes to mind), but with the kind of muscle-stretching that’s specific to Saloman’s current vision. It’s like watching a human form being gradually inflated until it becomes a giant.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All this physicality—the way Saloman’s music embodies human motion—is perhaps why his solo work doesn’t feel dry or incomplete. Often scores are too conceptual to sound like fullly-formed music, or their scope seems limited—you sense there’s something else going on, but since you can’t see it, you can’t really hear it either. But nothing’s missing on </span><i>The Disciplined Body</i><span>. Everything you need to know is right there in Gabriel Saloman’s rich, moving music.</span></p></div>"|19877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19877-gabriel-saloman-movement-building-vol-1/|7.7|Marc Masters

The tenor and quality of that awfulness have varied slightly—2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2772-encore/""><i>Encore</i></a> was awful in an embarrassed, shrugging, transparent way; <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13034-relapse/"">Relapse</a>'s</i> awfulness lay in its regressive puerility. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14380-recovery/""><i>Recovery</i></a>, he discovered a new and commercially successful kind of awful, mixing the ugly viscera of domestic abuse with power-ballad glucose. </p>
<p>The awfulness he settled on for last year's endless <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18733-eminem-the-marshall-mathers-lp-2/""><i>Marshall Mathers LP 2</i></a> seems to be his new default: He's aggressively, thoroughly, <i>eagerly</i> awful, like a sociopathic A-student who thinks he's figured out exactly what you are looking for. In this case, it's snarling syllables and endless vitriol. <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-revives-the-real-slim-shady-20131023"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">He has never been working harder</a>, Eminem has observed in interviews; in the sense that he's released a 78-minute album and another disc of new music all in the last year, he's right. But the wearying, dispiriting, and frankly numbing output of his current career phase isn't ""work."" It's maniacal persistence, of the same sort that leads<a href=""http://jezebel.com/finance-douche-throws-pee-pants-tantrum-after-being-rej-1630717593?utm_campaign=socialfow_jezebel_twitter&amp;utm_source=jezebel_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> some douche </a>to text a woman 38 times about the $32k he made in June. </p>
<p>Seconds into the 2xCD label compilation <i>Shady XV</i>, which pairs 12 new songs with a disc of ""greatest hits,"" Eminem fires up his rappity-rap sputtering chainsaw, and it never ceases for the spiritually exhausting hour that follows. Even at his peak, his rapping was never melodious, but at his nadir, he has all the musicality of a leaf-blower. The production functions simply, like a stopwatch: It's there to tell him when to start and when to stop, and occasionally a juiced-up power-rock chorus interrupts him. Submitting production to an Eminem album must feel, for a producer, something like a novelist feeding their manuscript into a wood chipper. On the one hand, you are guaranteed unprecedented exposure, and on the other, you are all but ensuring that no one will notice a note of your work.</p>
<p>These days, Eminem raps in a near-constant shout, with every line escalating into rage spittle that erases all tension or continuity or emotional impact. In his will to annihilate, he's also abandoned all claims to sense. ""Affable guy next door's laughable/ My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms that'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser/ With a motion sensor/ No emotion, hence I guess a sick prick dies hard/ I got a Magic Johnson,"" he babbles on ""Shady XV"". He then goes onto say ""I'll slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster"" and adds something about ""Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson (grr) animal snarls."" There's nothing here to be impressed by.</p>
<p>Or observe this string of logorrhea from ""Right For Me"": ""Roses are violet, mollys are blue, lost in a ball of confusion it's all an illusion/ It's probably the shrooms I'm on, cuz I think I started hallucinating/ Cuz I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit/ And all I could do was just follow the music and end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza filling water balloons with nail polish remover."" Could you even <i>read</i> all that without your eyes glazing over?</p>
<p>Mathers' great talent—his 180-degree ear for how everything can be made to rhyme with everything else, how chains of these rhyming lines can be erected into dizzying towers—has officially devolved into a tic. His verses denature all sense of pronunciation and meter and natural speech rhythm; you could probably read this review as one long Eminem verse. </p>
<p>The glimmers of self-awareness that pop up here and there are the passing thoughts of a superstar, bobbing bottles of insight in an ocean of gibberish. ""A martyr on a private charter/ Whose life could be harder?"" he sneers at himself on ""Shady XV"". On ""Fine Line"", he wonders ""Is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?"" Occasionally he buries a confession in plain sight, as on ""Fine Line"": ""Sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit, browse, I don't even wanna buy nothing, I just wanna fuckin' wanna walk around inside it/ Look how excited I sound when I get to talking about life and everything about it I miss."" There's nothing artful or even interesting about that phrasing, or the way he tortures and twists the vowels so they rhyme (""sometimes"" finds its way mashed up against ""I don't"", which is forced to then rhyme with ""I just"", ""inside it"", ""excited I sound"" and ""I miss"", a mess of nonsensical emphases), but the feeling is legible, an isolation and a prevailing sense of unworthiness that has always lingered beneath Mathers' hateful snarl.</p>
<p>The greatest-hits disc is a misnomer: It's mostly a grab-bag of Shady throwaways and deep cuts. But there are some good songs here: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4338-obie-trice/"">Obie Trice</a> gets three of them, all good and worth rescuing from the commercially doomed albums they were buried on. There's the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dre</a>-produced ""The Setup"", from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8242-cheers/""><i>Cheers</i></a>; ""Cry Now [Shady Remix]""; and the Entourage theme song ""Wanna Know"", in which Trice spits over a tumbling garage rock sample. For some reason, several cuts from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"">50 Cent</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3045-get-rich-or-die-tryin/""><i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i></a>, one of the most ubiquitous rap albums in history, are reproduced. There are a couple of decent, bruising <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28215-slaughterhouse/"">Slaughterhouse</a> songs. But the presence of these songs is mostly a signifier of the Shady Industry, the group of hangers-on that on some level seems to keep Mathers going.</p>
<p>On the saccharine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"">Sia</a>-featuring single ""Guts Over Fear"", Eminem baldly admits to resorting to the sophomore and puerile tactics here—threatening to punch <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a> in a BET freestyle, or threatening to rape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30296-iggy-azalea/"">Iggy Azalea</a> on ""Vegas""—because he has no other ideas, and nothing further to say, and is painfully aware of it: ""There's no more emotion for me to pull from/ Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun/ So, to the break of dawn, here I go, recycling the same old song,"" he says. The frankness of the message is remarkable: We're stuck with him, an aging white man with nothing left to say gripping the biggest bullhorn in hip-hop.</p></div>"|20036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20036-various-artists-shady-xv/|2.0|Jayson Greene

""All the like, scholastic, kind of academic '90s things that were happening there, I was really into,"" Herren says, noting he had a hip-hop day job in Atlanta at the time. ""You guys weren't, like, 'Oh, we're gonna do electronic music,' like <i>boom, boom—</i>no four-four shit. You guys always did something melodic.""</p>
<p>Herren's remarks may strike a note of familiar nostalgia for longtime Mouse on Mars fans, and for anyone somehow stumbling on this loose, playful, slightly overstuffed record unaware it will be the first real clue as to what all this is about. Since the duo of Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma formed Mouse on Mars in 1993, they've blurred the edges of techno, electro-acoustic music, and pop tunefulness over the course of about a dozen albums, most recently 2012's virtuosically maximalist <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16331-parastrophics/"">Parastrophics</a></i>. They've also long indulged a collaborative streak; just recently, Toma produced Africa Express's star-studded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57518-africa-express-announce-terry-rileys-in-c-mali-featuring-damon-albarn-brian-eno-nick-zinner/"" target=""_blank"">tribute</a> to Terry Riley's ""In C"". On <i>21 Again</i>, they bring together slightly more than 21 collaborations between Mouse on Mars and other artists, plus several recorded messages such as the one from Herren.</p>
<p>The results, spanning 32 tracks and nearly two hours, are best approached as a huge party full of Mouse on Mars' old friends. It can be overwhelming, with so many distinguished and varied attendees you'd be hard-pressed to remember your conversations the next morning, but there's more than enough squishy-synthed whimsy here to make <i>21 Again</i> a worthwhile listen, particularly for those veteran fans but also for that hypothetical newcomer, who might replicate Herren's experience of being inspired by Mouse on Mars and their extended musical family. And if the broader culture takes nothing else away from this set, the general concept is ripe for adoption: 21st birthdays are wasted on the 21.</p>
<p>Mouse on Mars have always resisted easy categorization, and that's evident in the sheer eclecticism on display here. One of <i>21 Again</i>'s unique draws is a one-off reunion by fellow German duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1589-funkstorung/"">Funkstörung</a>, who split in 2008; their lovely, idea-packed Mouse on Mars team-up ""Bon Djerry"" could easily at one time have been called IDM. But other highlights are pillowy R&amp;B (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2229-junior-boys/"">Junior Boys</a> contribution ""Putty Tart""), mesmerizing guitar-and-groove workouts in the locked-in style of what once would've been called post-rock (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> track ""Shoe Fly""), twitchy disco-funk (""Fertilized"" with Cavern of Anti-Matter, a project featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>'s Tim Gane), off-kilter synth-pop (""Lost and Found"" with Eric D Clark), or a contemplative, storytelling reverie (""My Toe Is on Fire,"" with Stereolab's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28928-laetitia-sadier/"">Laetitia Sadier</a>). Never is it just ""oh, we're gonna do electronic music, <i>boom, boom</i>.""</p>
<p>The jumble works in context, though each listener will probably pick out different tracks to repeat or avoid. The muscular dance-rap of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"">Modeselektor</a>'s ""Purple Fog"" ensures this feels like an actual 21st birthday party, but if I were putting together a playlist of similar music I'm not sure it'd be the first choice that came to mind. Still, all this bouncing around, whether to the gauzy beats of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2630-machine-drum/"">Machinedrum</a> collaboration ""Juice Clr 9"", the cathartic tribal-drum ululations of ""Nkanka"" with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"">Boredoms</a>'/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3162-ooioo/"">OOIOO</a>'s Yoshimi P-We, or the cerebral clicks and whirs of ""Double Bum"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"">Matthew Herbert</a>, helps keep rewarding attention over such an extensive collection. In fact, from a crackling, tightly drawn collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3187-oval/"">Oval</a> to a clanging, berserk track with Tyondai Braxton, the former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"">Battles</a> frontman, <i>21 Again</i> could also almost serve as a survey course of the past couple of decades in experimental music.</p>
<p>The birthday messages, though, drive home the sense of <i>21 Again</i> as a low-stakes, insular bit of fun rather than a sweeping artistic statement. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">The Fall</a>'s Mark E. Smith, who joined up with Mouse on Mars in 2007 as Von Südenfed, and his wife Elena Poulou open the record with goofy happy-birthday chatter that sets the mood of warm bonhomie. Non-German speakers will have to settle for being charmed by the laughter during the best wishes from artist Ingrid Wiener and her husband Oswald. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2038-a-hawk-and-a-hacksaw/"">A Hawk and a Hacksaw</a> turn their greeting into another chance for musical collaboration, performing Balkan-folk instrumental ""Celebration Song"" with Hungarian musician Balázs Unger. If DJ Scotch Egg's chiptune ""Mouse on Egg (Happy Birthday)!"", which uses the 19th-century melody that's customary for such occasions, brings a call from the copyright lawyers, well, 21st birthdays often involve audacious decisions. After 21 years, Mouse on Mars remain joyously unpredictable.</p></div>"|20018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20018-mouse-on-mars-21-again/|7.3|Marc Hogan

I don't mean to say Shall merely ""went as"" Angus Young for Halloween; what I mean is, from the socks-and-shorts to the upturned brim, <a href=""http://perryshall.tumblr.com/post/101452474170"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this dude <i>was</i> Angus Young</a>. I bring this up to underscore Shall's greatest strength as a frontman: he has a real knack for inhabiting the look and feel of a very particular era of rock'n'roll, the post-prog, pre-NWOBHM intermingling of hard-rock and proto-punk. At no point during Hound's <i>Out of Time</i>—a triangulation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr9ie2J2690"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Highway Star""</a>, the first few <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> LPs, and a not-unhealthy fixation with one <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lemmy Kilmister</a>—do Shall and company attempt to flaunt tradition, to push well-defined boundaries, to reinvent the wheel. Rather, the band's looking to get back to something elemental: burly, bongwater-splattered rock'n'roll, the kind designed to sound particularly righteous coming from a pinstriped AMC Gremlin.</p>
<p>More than anything, <i>Out of Time</i> is unrelenting; just over 27 minutes of low rumbles and snaky leads, pausing only for the delicately fingerpicked ""Colintro""—courtesy of bassist Colin McGinniss, also of None More Black—just past the halfway point. Shall's not a flashy player, neither as swaggering as Angus or as restless as ""Fast"" Eddie. Still, as a student of the classics, he's picked up just the right combination of attack and restraint, and <i>Out of Time</i> does lean every bit as well as mean. Taken together, the album's arid production—a kind of bleary, mid-fi tunnelvision—and near-monomaniacal drive are transportive, beamed in directly from the middle of a long, dark night spent blasting down some backwater at 90 MPH, lids heavy, heart pounding.</p>
<p>Leadoff single and snarling highlight ""Little One"" plunges a particularly toothsome Shall riff headlong into a roaring McGinniss bassline. Better still is ""I Can't Take It No More"", an anxious, hard-charging punker that finds an unusually excitable-sounding Shall screaming his way around the chorus. He's not exactly a brazen presence behind the mic; throughout plenty of <i>Out of Time</i>, he coats his voice in a thin layer of fuzz, or deadpans his way through his delivery, allowing certain lines to get stuck in the surrounding sludge. Even at full howl, though, Shall's never in any danger of overpowering these monstrous riffs, and <i>Out of Time</i> sounds best whenever he drops the inhibitions and fully leans into these songs. To that end, the Sabbath-indebted slowdown—""Houdini"", ""Stupid Dreams""—sandwiching the outlying ""Colintro"" is a slight momentum-sapper; they don't plod, exactly, but they don't quite get the blood going like the scrappier stuff surrounding them.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <i>Out of Time</i> isn't much to chew on. While Shall smartly sidesteps the dunderheaded machismo too often associated with capital-R rock revivalism, what he offers in its stead—anxiety, boredom, and self-doubt, more or less—is only a mild improvement. ""If god was real, I think she'd be disgraced,"" Shall sings on ""Stupid Dreams""; it's maybe the single most intriguing thought to be found on <i>Out of Time</i>, one Shall all but leaves unexplored. Still, this de-emphasis on lyrics is in keeping with tradition; despite what your uncle's trying to tell you with that wrongheaded <a href=""http://loldaddy.com/img/uploaded_pics/loldaddy.com-1329268988.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Led Zeppelin vs. Nicki Minaj""</a> meme he keeps slapping on your Facebook wall, the hard rock canon Hound are harkening back to has a long, storied tradition of dumb, overwrought, or otherwise beside-the-point lyrics. At this point, Hound seemingly aren't all that interested in toppling their influences or killing their idols; instead, they're trying to inhabit them, to pile up enough riffs to tap into that deathless feeling of plowing down the road, windows down, speakers blaring, the night ahead of them. That much, they nail.</p></div>"|19985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19985-hound-out-of-time/|6.8|Paul Thompson

Though it took a long time, his distinctive beat is part of the world’s musical vocabulary now. Since parting ways with Fela, he’s done quite a range of work, including a couple of recent, fairly high-profile collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"">Damon Albarn</a> that took him pretty far away from the pigeonhole people tend to place him in on the basis of his best-known playing.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><i>Film of Life</i> doesn’t quite break new ground for Allen, but it does offer a pretty solid and succinct demonstration of Afrobeat’s adaptability to changing times. There are no side-long epics in the Fela mold here, but Allen packs quite a bit into each of these four-to-seven-minute-tracks, building up from his own drums grooves with hypnotic guitar and bass patterns, a richly arranged horn section, and an assortment of other sounds that are nearly all overwhelmed by the massive rhythm that dominates everything.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Allen himself handles vocals on the first two tracks, mostly talking in his deep bass register and aided by a female chorus, narrating a personal history and thanking the listener for being there. His voice is appropriately situated well down in the mix; he does his best talking with his hands, and though he shows a little uncharacteristic flash here and there, the really impressive thing about Allen is the way he can take a simple, slow beat like the one on ""Tiger’s Skip"" and make it sing when a lot of drummers would have trouble just staying in time at that tempo. Comparing it to the much faster beat on the storming, spacey funk instrumental ""Ewa"" reveals a lot about what makes his playing so special; no matter what else is going on, Allen has an ability to stay steady and fill time with exactly as much embellishment as necessary.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Albarn’s guest vocal turn on ""Go Back"" provides the album’s highlight and the closest thing to a single that it has to offer. The man could sound sad singing ""The Wheels on the Bus"", and the contrast of his hang-dog delivery and Allen’s spryness makes for a song as good as anything the two have done together in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9778-the-good-the-bad-the-queen/"" target=""_blank"">the Good, the Bad, and the Queen</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16365-rocket-juice-the-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Rocket Juice &amp; the Moon</a>. Moments like this and Kuku’s totally unexpected Auto-Tuned vocal in the second half of ""Koko Dance"" take <i>Film of Life</i> a few steps past a simple summary of the things Allen excels at and make it something to hear even for people who aren’t Afrobeat obsessives.</p></div>"|19953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19953-tony-allen-film-of-life/|7.2|Joe Tangari

We’re seeing a lot of that in hip-hop, where producers from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"">El-P</a> are simply making their own beats to imitate the sounds that they love, and in that way, avoiding the ire of the original creators. The development has also reverberated within the world of formerly sample-happy electronic music, where even big-name producers whose entire process was once screwing around with samples have begun to switch up their style.</p>
<p>That’s certainly the case with Charlie Yin: the producer, working under the name Giraffage, was known most well for sampled beats like the one on last year’s thrilling <a href=""http://www.alphapuprecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alpha Pup</a> single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14850-close-2-me/"">""Close 2 Me""</a>, and his remix of the entirety of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"">The-Dream</a> album <i>Love Hate</i>. Yin signed to <a href=""http://foolsgoldrecs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fool’s Gold</a> this past June and promptly announced a new EP by releasing a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RatJDuChb3Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of R. Kelly’s ""Ignition (Remix)"". But when the EP, <i>No Reason</i>, arrived last week it was accompanied by an interesting disclosure: the songs on it were written completely <a href=""https://twitter.com/giraffage/status/534760529043025921"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sample-free</a>.</p>
<p>That’s what Giraffage says, anyway. Listening to the EP, fans will notice a wealth of the same kind of tricks that Yin hooked them with in the first place. There are still plenty of vocals and sound effects present here: ""Hello"" kicks off the record with a screwed up version of the phrase: ""I just want to hear that we’re ok"" and those words echo throughout the track, set between the sound of iOS notifications, dial tones, static, and the lushest of synthesizers. When he talks about eschewing samples, Yin may just mean that he wrote all the instrumental music before adding borrowed sounds. But even if he recorded the other noises himself, their variety and interpolation contributes to the same sense of dynamism and depth that's always powered his music. Which is to say that, even if everything about his process has changed, not much about his music has.</p>
<p>Which is good news: Giraffage excels at wringing a variety of feelings out of his tracks, using changes in register as an emotional dial. By changing how high or low a voice registers, he’s able to shift the way we understand what we’re hearing, as on ""Tell Me"", in which the title phrase is spun back and forth so that it’s made to sound like a dialogue between lovers. But even more important is what’s happening lower in the mix, where a wall of sound rears up, suffusing the listener in colored sonics so deep that the words become a small part of an enormous sensation.</p>
<p>This kind of sudden eruption is typical of Giraffage; the producer's become a populist favorite as much because of his willingness to use traditional drops as his penchant for candy-colored R&amp;B. ""Be With You"", the last and best song on the record, pulls the beat out several times only to reintroduce it with fringed, lightning-rod synths on top of it. Fans will recognize the instrumental; it’s the same one that was constructed around that R. Kelly remix, though it actually works better as a standalone.</p>
<p>And maybe that’s really what Giraffage means when he talks about his new approach. His work with remixes and samples in general has always reflected a remarkable sense of depth, so much so that, if you were to pull out the original artist’s work, you would still be left with the sense of hearing a complete track. More than ever, the music he’s constructed on <i>No Reason</i> has the ability to stand on its own. But add the vocals and the ticks, the bleeps and the bloops, and you’ve got style in addition to that solidity. Those smaller elements make Yin who he is as a musician, and samples or no samples, here’s hoping he doesn’t abandon them anytime soon.</p></div>"|20026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20026-giraffage-no-reason-ep/|7.3|Jonah Bromwich

As post-war urban renewal squeezed black families into towering inner-city housing developments and whites out into their sprawling suburbs, this hamlet near the south end of western Long Island’s Queens bordering Nassau County served as a template for suburban integration. Blacks and whites cohabited there for years until real estate agents’ racist scare tactics pushed white families to sell at a loss and funneled new black ones into the same homes at inflated prices. The city's methodical transformation would have a profound effect on Nassau local Carlton Ridenhour, better known as Chuck D. On the short trip from home to nearby Adelphi University, where he studied graphic design, Chuck could watch the soft segregated lower-middle-class black community of Roosevelt give way to golf and country clubs for the affluent, predominantly white Garden City, home to Adelphi and a pair of prestigious prep schools. First-hand experience of racialized contempt, along with a rich education from civil rights activist parents, sparked a righteous ire in Chuck that would burn hot and bright in the following years.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Public Enemy formed around Chuck’s gig at Adelphi’s student radio station, gaining momentum as he and his friends’ forays into rap music grew increasingly accomplished. Their squelching, skeletal ""Public Enemy No. 1"" won a fan in <a href=""http://www.defjam.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Def Jam</a> co-founder Rick Rubin, kicking off a lengthy courtship of Chuck, sidekick Flavor Flav, DJ Terminator X and producers Hank Shocklee and Eric Sadler. Two years later, the group caved and signed with the label. A debut album (1987’s <i>Yo! Bum Rush the Show</i>) and a package tour with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3617-run-dmc/"">Run-D.M.C.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10584-ll-cool-j/?"">LL Cool J</a> followed. The music was boldly gritty, if a touch late to the party, scooped by advances in landmark singles by Big Daddy Kane and Eric B. &amp; Rakim released the same year. The live show was gripping, Chuck and Flav stalking the stage as ""Minister of Information"" Professor Griff cut in with searing political diatribes and the S1w’s, the group’s security detail, performed silent combat exercises with toy rifles in the background. It was black power theater. It shocked American audiences cold. Concerns about P.E.’s image and intent quickly arose: Were they gangsters? Terrorists? Separatists? <i>Yo! </i>stalled out around 400,000 units sold, a modest turnout in the wake of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>’ blockbuster <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/607-licensed-to-ill/""><i>Licensed to Ill</i></a>, and Public Enemy entered into a contentious dance with the media that would precipitate their greatest successes and their darkest hardships.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In retrospect, <i>Yo! Bum Rush the Show </i>was a blueprint. What came after it was the work of a well-rehearsed unit keenly aware of its purpose and capabilities. Released the following summer, Public Enemy’s sophomore album <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back </i>was a brash refinement of the themes of <i>Yo! </i>and a jab at the jaws of detractors, high and low. ""Bring the Noise"" and ""Don’t Believe the Hype"" railed against the press, holding up the lurid sensationalism surrounding the group as a warning against trusting anything you read. ""Caught, Can We Get a Witness?"" is a nightmare where P.E. gets nabbed for sampling. (More on that later.) <i>Nation </i>teemed with a didactic social consciousness too. ""She Watch Channel Zero?!"" strikes out against junk television, while ""Night of the Living Baseheads"" addresses the crack epidemic, and ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"" leads a draft-dodging conscientious objector through a vengeful jailbreak. Chuck’s booming ministerial baritone sparred with Flav’s piercing yawp in a masterful hero-and-sidekick interplay. The message couldn’t entice the masses without the levity; the levity was gimmicky without revolutionary grit giving it weight.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Nation </i>found a way to expound on the explosive soundscapes of the debut without exhausting listeners or cluttering the mix. Chuck, Sadler, and the Shocklee brothers’ production as the Bomb Squad was as thick as its source material was diverse; it was rap, soul, rock, funk and musique concrète all at once. ""Most people were saying that rap music was noise,"" Hank Shocklee told <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/public-enemy-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-back-20110330"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a><i> </i>in 1989, ""and we decided, ‘If they think it’s noise, let’s show them noise.’"" ""She Watch Channel Zero?!"" pulls its central riff from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"">Slayer</a>’s thrash classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6_zsJ8KPP0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Angel of Death""</a>. ""Night of the Living Baseheads"" outfits a stable of trusty James Brown samples with over a dozen assorted soul and rap tidbits and bridges, folding in elements of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9ikatomf6g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ESG’s ""UFO""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-_30HA7rec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie’s ""Fame""</a>. Snippets of legendary speeches from Jesse Jackson and Malcolm X and stage banter from Public Enemy’s successful European tour formed connective tissue between songs for a unified listening experience that only let up briefly in the middle and finally, at the end. The Bomb Squad built beats like ships in a bottle, delicately stitching tiny pieces of black history into layered blasts of sound. Public Enemy looked and sounded a fright to the uninitiated, but careful attention showed every piece of this black radical machine moving in perfect concert.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Nation of Millions </i>netted Public Enemy the elusive American audience and platinum sales their debut couldn’t, and it changed the face of rap music. The hip-hop landscape of ‘89-’90 was dotted with sample-heavy sons of <i>Nation</i>. Chuck sent early copies of the album out west to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dre</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"">Ice Cube</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3086-nwa/"">N.W.A.</a>’s landmark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11791-straight-outta-compton-efil4zaggin/""><i>Straight Outta Compton </i></a>cropped up like a gangsta rap rejoinder to the Bomb Squad ethos. (Cube would later tap the team for production on his post-N.W.A. solo debut <i>AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted</i>.) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1028-de-la-soul/"">De La Soul</a>’s <i>3 Feet High and Rising </i>and the Beastie Boys’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12671-pauls-boutique/""><i>Paul’s Boutique </i></a>added a playful, psychedelic charm to the proceedings. <i>Nation</i>’s message of black self-sufficiency resonated through the proudly Afrocentric art of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6195-a-tribe-called-quest/"">A Tribe Called Quest</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Clan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">X Clan</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/567-brand-nubian/"">Brand Nubian</a> and more. Beyond the '80s, the music of <i>Nation of Millions </i>would continue to find new life in unexpected places: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>’s 1996 comeback single ""El Scorcho"" nicked its ""I’m the epitome of public enemy"" barb from ""Don’t Believe the Hype"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay-Z</a>’s 2006 post-retirement salvo ""Show Me What You Got"" is a nod to <i>Nation</i>’s ""Show ‘Em Whatcha Got"". (Without Public Enemy we don’t get <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>; in addition to sampling the Long Island legends liberally, Kanye inherited a bit of his fearless politics and kitchen sink beat construction from here.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Critics warmed to Public Enemy in the wake of <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions </i>but remained suspicious of their political affiliations. ""If Farrakhan’s a prophet my dick’s bigger than Don Howland’s,"" <i>Village Voice </i>scribe Robert Christgau <a href=""http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pj88.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quipped</a> in a year-end roundup, ""but that doesn’t make <i>Nation of Millions </i>anything less than the bravest and most righteous experimental pop of the decade."" Others would be less warm as Professor Griff’s incendiary ethics began to strike sour notes. He <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/public-enemy-rockin-the-joint-19880922"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">publicly accused</a> white America of bestiality during a press-filled gig at Rikers Island in 1988 and voiced a shocking disdain for Jews and gays in various interviews overseas. In the spring of 1989, <i>Washington Times </i>scribe David Mills sat Griff down and coaxed out a rant charged with cold, ugly hate speech that would quickly torch the group’s reputation on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Privately, Chuck struggled with how to respond to the controversy. At first, he stood by Griff, then he announced Griff’s expulsion from the group, then, amid a growing media firestorm, he disbanded Public Enemy entirely. The hiatus was short-lived. Spike Lee’s blistering racial relations passion play <i>Do the Right Thing </i>debuted a week after the firestorm with a new Public Enemy song as its theme. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PaoLy7PHwk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fight the Power""</a> summarized the mood of both the film and the climate it was released into. It telegraphed the tense discomfort of a New York summer where innocent youth from <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/services/central-park-five"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Central Park</a> to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Yusef_Hawkins"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bensonhurst</a> would pay the ultimate price for being black in the wrong place at the wrong time. By July, the seemingly inactive group had a #1 Billboard rap single, and work was quietly underway on a <i>Nation of Millions </i>follow-up. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Fear of a Black Planet </i>from 1990 made kindling of the previous summer’s anti-Public Enemy sentiment, quoting the group’s biggest critics in interludes and ribbing them in the songs. ""Contract on the World Love Jam"" weaves negative news reports into a scene-setting intro; later ""Incident at 66.6 FM"" sets outraged calls from a Chuck D squareoff with New York political radio host Alan Colmes over sedate keys and drums, playing the grumps for squares without even responding to their charges. A late album Terminator X showcase snarkily titled ""Leave This Off Your Fuckin Charts"" is a tenacious dare. Elsewhere, <i>Fear </i>pulls the camera off P.E. to speak to community issues. ""Anti-Nigger Machine"" and ""Who Stole the Soul?"" levied heavy accusations of censorship while ""911 Is a Joke"" explored black community police mistrust and ""Fear of a Black Planet"" tackled apprehension about interracial dating. Sourcing Public Enemy’s media struggles back to age-old racial strife was a brash, heavy-handed play, but <i>Fear</i>’s genius trick was coating its righteous rage in music that aimed to groove where earlier songs seemed to want to maim. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Fear of a Black Planet </i>finds the Bomb Squad at the height of their powers, assembling deeply intricate grooves out of infinitesimal building blocks. ""Pollywannacracka"" cycles through a breakneck array of sounds inside of its first 10 seconds and modulates between spacious verses and a jam-packed chorus, bubbling into bedlam whenever Chuck stops rapping. ""Fight the Power"" manages to cram over a dozen different samples into five minutes of shockingly smooth funk. What sets these songs apart from the last batch is that their structure was often as varied as their list of ingredients. They didn’t just modulate between similar verses and choruses. These compositions breathed, moved, changed from one refrain to the next, from one second to the next. A new sound showed face on every listen. <i>Fear of a Black Planet </i>deftly stated the case for hip-hop as savvy collage art rather than pastiche. Sure, they borrowed liberally from pre-existing music, but these patchwork symphonies bore scant resemblance to their source material.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It should be noted that none of this can ever happen again. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2902-biz-markie/"">Biz Markie</a> was sued over an unauthorized sample in 1991, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Upright_Music,_Ltd._v._Warner_Bros._Records_Inc."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the judge’s ruling</a> required future producers to seek the original artist’s clearance before incorporating a sample into a new composition. Overnight it became forbiddingly difficult and expensive to incorporate even a handful of samples into a new beat. The nightmare of ""Caught, Can We Get a Witness?"" had become the hard reality. Producers scaled back their creations, often augmenting one choice groove with a bevy of instrumental embellishments. This is how we arrive at the lush live band pomp of West Coast G-funk, the cold synthetics of early 2000s East Coast rap, and the gothic textures of Southern crunk and trap. The early Public Enemy masterpieces remain unique and inimitable now, relics of a world irreparably changed though in a few notable ways, very much the same. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The strife that birthed <i>Nation of Millions </i>and <i>Black Planet </i>is mirrored in some of the upheaval of 2014. The business of hip-hop has changed, as free mixtapes have supplanted retail albums as the chief method of kicking off a rap career. Artistic freedom can evaporate at the drop of a gavel. (see: Lord Finesse’s pursuit of Mac Miller for borrowing a beat on a free release.) Hip-hop has again had its political mettle tested by social injustices too systemic to deny. Returning to <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back </i>and <i>Fear of a Black Planet </i>for these just-released reissues is an encouraging reminder of what a hip-hop album can be to the world, a peek back at that one time a rap act pissed square into the mouth of adversity and came away unscathed. Hear the drummer get wicked.</p></div>"|19997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19997-public-enemy-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-backfear-of-a-black-planet/|10.0|Craig Jenkins

What sets these songs apart from the last batch is that their structure was often as varied as their list of ingredients. They didn’t just modulate between similar verses and choruses. These compositions breathed, moved, changed from one refrain to the next, from one second to the next. A new sound showed face on every listen. <i>Fear of a Black Planet </i>deftly stated the case for hip-hop as savvy collage art rather than pastiche. Sure, they borrowed liberally from pre-existing music, but these patchwork symphonies bore scant resemblance to their source material.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It should be noted that none of this can ever happen again. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2902-biz-markie/"">Biz Markie</a> was sued over an unauthorized sample in 1991, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Upright_Music,_Ltd._v._Warner_Bros._Records_Inc."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the judge’s ruling</a> required future producers to seek the original artist’s clearance before incorporating a sample into a new composition. Overnight it became forbiddingly difficult and expensive to incorporate even a handful of samples into a new beat. The nightmare of ""Caught, Can We Get a Witness?"" had become the hard reality. Producers scaled back their creations, often augmenting one choice groove with a bevy of instrumental embellishments. This is how we arrive at the lush live band pomp of West Coast G-funk, the cold synthetics of early 2000s East Coast rap, and the gothic textures of Southern crunk and trap. The early Public Enemy masterpieces remain unique and inimitable now, relics of a world irreparably changed though in a few notable ways, very much the same. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The strife that birthed <i>Nation of Millions </i>and <i>Black Planet </i>is mirrored in some of the upheaval of 2014. The business of hip-hop has changed, as free mixtapes have supplanted retail albums as the chief method of kicking off a rap career. Artistic freedom can evaporate at the drop of a gavel. (see: Lord Finesse’s pursuit of Mac Miller for borrowing a beat on a free release.) Hip-hop has again had its political mettle tested by social injustices too systemic to deny. Returning to <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back </i>and <i>Fear of a Black Planet </i>for these just-released reissues is an encouraging reminder of what a hip-hop album can be to the world, a peek back at that one time a rap act pissed square into the mouth of adversity and came away unscathed. Hear the drummer get wicked.</p></div>"|19997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19997-public-enemy-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-backfear-of-a-black-planet/|10.0|Craig Jenkins

The general sense is that there's almost nothing in the pop or R&amp;B mainstream that bridged these two sides of Sly Stone for the wider public.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>History states that </span><i>Riot </i><span>was an unexpected detour into pessimistic introspection to an audience that only knew the sunnier side of a band that looked and sounded like the best possible socially integrated future. And with three mid-late 1969 songs (""Hot Fun in the Summertime"" and ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)"" b/w ""Everbody Is a Star"") as the only new cuts to appear under the Sly and the Family Stone banner for nearly two years, it was easy to wonder exactly how that transition happened—and how it sounded.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Miles Marshall Lewis's absolutely essential <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Family-Stones-Theres-Riot-Goin/dp/0826417442"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">33 1/3</a> on <i>Riot </i>tells a good part of the story—the disillusioned national mood after the Death of the Sixties, Sly's post-Woodstock ambivalence towards the fame he once craved, and his sonic turn towards introversion and quietude that manifested in muffled vocals and a restrained drum machine in place of Greg Errico's thunderous backbeat. Also hinted at, but by no means marginalized, is the story of Stone Flower, the vanity label Atlantic Records let Sly run as part of his production deal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The biggest breakthrough from this imprint was Little Sister, the post-R&amp;B girl group comprised of Mary McCreary, Elva Mouton, and Stone's actual younger sister Vaetta ""Vet Stone"" Stewart. They'd already earned some measure of renown as backup singers on some of the Family's biggest hits and found another place in history when their 1970 version of </span><span><i>Stand!</i> </span><span>deep cut ""Somebody's Watching You"" became the first major hit single to use a drum machine—a Maestro Rhythm King. It wouldn't be the last to do so in Sly's hands.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Stone Flower as a label produced four singles in all, one promo-only, all written by Sly and many of them stripped-down revamps of older Family Stone material. But thanks to alternate versions, outtakes, and prototypical versions of songs that would later form the backbone of </span><i>Riot</i><span>, </span><i>I'm Just Like You: Sly's Stone Flower 1969-70 </i><span>fortuitously doubles as the clearest available sonic roadmap for one of the most radical transformations in pop history. The exhaustive liner notes, written by Alec Palao, lay out every detail from Stone's preferred settings for the MRK-1 to the pitfalls of trying to balance outside production and personal work, benefiting from a decade-plus worth of archived and recent interviews. The talk with Sly is worth the price alone, from his admitted pioneering of the ""</span><span>all </span><span>instruments are real"" drum machine defense to his take on the less-is-more approach—or, in his terms, ""more is less""—that informed his early 1970s releases.</span></p>
<p>The clearest route through this evolution runs through Little Sister's music, five variations on three songs pointing to their unsung role in the Family and Sly's efforts to use them as a conduit for some of his newer ideas. It wasn't, however, an immediate shift. The first, full-band version of ""Somebody's Watching You"", included here, makes that later single version's minimalism even more striking: with clearer voices, bright horns, and a guitar figure that's more prominent than the final track's ghostly presence, it's hard to imagine it escaping the shadow of the <i>Stand!</i> original. Meanwhile, the debut Little Sister single ""You're the One"" doesn't have the historical import of ""Somebody's Watching You"", but it was a bigger hit; with its slippery, heavy-bottomed kick-cymbal pattern, its proto-disco bonafides are unimpeachable while it provides some of the last throes of ""Thank You""-style twanging funk lingering in Sly's system.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That big change came within the year. The final version of ""Somebody's Watching You"", released in November 1970, is mighty illuminating, the original </span><i>Stand! </i><span>version's glib ""shady as a lady with a mustache"" silliness revealing a quiet intensity underneath. (The singers' emphatic swings from hushed restraint to full belting on certain lines—""just when you think you've pulled a fast one"" is a particularly sharp jolt—sounds even more surprising than that now-familiar mechanical drum pattern.) The B-side to the original 7"", a more uptempo cut titled ""Stanga"", points even more clearly to the future; the juxtaposed MRK and shadowy wah-wah guitar fit the </span><i>Riot </i><span>blueprint almost as starkly as its dark, cynical-realist lyrics do. Imagine hearing ""Everybody Is a Star"" in December '69 and learning less than a year later that the same man would write the line ""Sometime or another, you're gonna be stung/ Sometime or another, you might see a brother hung.""</span></p>
<p>Another piece of the puzzle is provided by Joe Hicks, an enigmatic singer whose output largely consists of a couple Stone-produced singles, a 1973 LP on Enterprise, and little else. Stone reveals little about the man (""[I knew him] back in Sacramento when he used to be a bully. He got real depressed, got strung out on heroin and died.""), and so does his single ""Life &amp; Death in G &amp; A""—a song originally given to the New York A&amp;M funk-rock band Abaco Dream in 1969 but rumored to have been played by the Family Stone themselves. Handled by Hicks, the two-key arrangement is a far cry instrumentally from the brass-blasting funk of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENaucSgxZ4U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Abaco Dream original</a> (or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVFUr66Xk1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the '74 Funkadelic-tinged Chairmen of the Board epic</a>, for that matter), the see-saw dynamic at its most extreme through the stark downtempo accompaniment and Hicks' almost pained-sounding wail of the refrain ""if it feels good, it's all right."" Like Little Sister's metamorphosis, the change of scene for Joe Hicks is represented by a major jump in Sly's approach; the horn-driven fuzzbomb of 1969's first Stone Flower production, ""I'm Goin' Home"" b/w ""Home Sweet Home"", is a fine feint towards both rock and funk that's the closest the Family Stone ever came to resembling the J.B.'s' beating-heart machinery precision. Another what-could've-been.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are four tracks on </span><i>I'm Just Like You </i><span>credited solely to Sly, demos and prototypes for what would eventually define the singular sound that ran through the lifeblood of </span><i>Riot</i><span>. (""Just Like a Baby"" is a little too fast, ""Spirit"" and ""Scared"" are unremarkable sketches, and ""Africa"" is coldly desolate when it's not talking to you.) But it's the band behind this compilation's titular song that proves to be the most compatible purveyor of Sly's developing vision. 6IX were a done-too-soon one-off group built around the talents of New York harmonica player/CBS mail clerk Marvin Braxton, with ""I'm Just Like You"" b/w ""Dynamite"" their sole Stone Flower single. Initially, they were their own thing; early-stage circa-'69 recordings (""Trying to Make You Feel Good"", ""You Can, We Can"", and an early full-band runthrough of ""I'm Just Like You"") relied on the punchy live-band funk provided by the former members of a mixed-race nightclub-circuit group called the Soul Rascals. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>By the time their sole single dropped in December 1970, however, the live band that warmed a Madison Square Garden crowd for Sly the previous month manifested on wax as Stone and Braxton alone with singer Charles Higgins. </span><span>Life </span><span>highlight ""Dynamite"", originally slated as the headliner, was remolded into a skulking, hiccuping, skeletal B-side. ""I'm Just Like You"" became the A-side, and its first 15 seconds—dusty drum machine clicks prodded by human hands, heavy-shouldered bass murky with humidity, organ notes that dart like wary eyes—could fit somewhere on a spectrum between ""Family Affair"" and ""Brave &amp; Strong"". And then Higgins starts belting lurching cartoons of Sly-esque melody to knockout effect, the empathy of ""Everyday People"" upended into a mirror-staring reckoning: ""Don't'cha know that I can see/ You're takin' steaks away from me/ You forgot, I get hungry too/ I know how you feel, I'm just like you."" Few knew at the time that this kind of spirit would lead to the dominant sound of </span><i>Riot</i><span>. But in retrospect, hearing that development going on made one thing clear: everything was new.</span></p></div>"|20011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20011-sly-stone-sly-stone-im-just-like-you-slys-stone-flower-1969-70/|8.1|Nate Patrin

Located in the northernmost tip of Quebec, just outside the Arctic Circle, their town—previously called Sugluk as well—consisted primarily of tents and igloos, with the first few permanent structures and power lines added in the 1960s. Even after that initial modernization, most teenagers traveled down to Kuujjuarapik or even as far south as Quebec City for school. The four musicians returned home with loads of pop records by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"">Hendrix</a>, and others, which they used as textbooks to teach themselves how to play their instruments and write their own songs. Soon they were playing community dance halls around the region, and their reputation grew to the point that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation recruited them to record two 7"" singles in 1975. That remains the extent of their catalog, although Sugluk continued touring into the 1980s and reunited in 2013.</p>
<p>Of their handful of extant tracks, three are included on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=light+in+the+attic"">Light in the Attic</a>’s new comp <i>Native North America (Vol. 1): Aboriginal Folk, Rock, and Country 1966-1985</i>. Those songs show a band developing an identity even as it stamps popular folk-rock with its own personal flourish. ""Fall Away"" opens with a thundering drum fill and a shaky one-note bass groove, setting the stage for singer George Kakayuk’s bittersweet tale of thwarted romance. The song has the folksy grit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>, but the rambunctious energy of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1609-flamin-groovies/"">Flamin’ Groovies</a>. Guitarist Tayara Papigatuk takes over on ""I Didn't Know"", which sounds so loose and rambling the rhythm section might be the only thing holding it together. Showing their range, ""Ajuinnarasuarsunga"" (which translates from Inuktitut as ""I Tried Hard"") is a folksier number defined by the band’s careful harmonies and a lovely piano rambling in the background. ""Though the band was not 100 percent satisfied with these raw one-take recordings,"" writes Kevin ""Sipreano"" Howes in the <i>Native North America </i>liner notes, ""they remain one of the earliest examples of original Inuit rock music recorded in Canada and carry an exceptional spiritual weight.""</p>
<p>If Sugluk emerge as one of the stars of <i>Native North America</i>, it’s largely because you can hear a very particular struggle in their songs—not necessarily to be heard by a mainstream audience, but to define themselves through some combination of Native American culture and popular music. That endeavor to some degree informs every song here, as artists from all over Canada calibrate their own equations for personal expression. Some, like the group Sikumiut, sound like they could play shows alongside Young or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a>. Others, like Morley Loon and Shingoose, barely nod to pop music at all. But almost everyone on <i>Native North America</i> writes and sings about the impulse to both imitate others and distinguish oneself. Gordon Dick, a member of the Lil’wat Nation and a self-taught guitarist, even gives a name to this music: ""I dreamed I was in a rock group, playing on a Saturday night. Our name wasn’t like the Beatles, but I found an old Indian name: Siwash Rock.""</p>
<p><i>Native North America</i> might have easily buckled under the weight of good intentions. Howes, a Toronto-based vinyl collector, DJ, and <a href=""http://voluntaryinnature.blogspot.ca"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blogger</a>, spent years scouring record stores and flea markets all over Canada to locate these rare records, then tracked down and researched the unsung artists behind them. That process by itself is important, as it provides valuable information on lesser-known chapters in the history of Canadian rock, but that alone doesn’t ensure a 2xCD/3xLP set, much less the first in what appears to be a multi-volume series, will be listenable or engaging as anything other than an artifact. Fortunately, Howes does not conflate the idea of the music—its origins, its politics, or its import—with the music itself. He has curated the tracklist not only to emphasize the diversity of the artists and their ideas, but to reveal the vibrancy and energy of this large and largely undocumented scene.</p>
<p><i>Native North America</i> likewise shows the extent to which popular music welcomes and nourishes marginalized perspectives; the form is endlessly adaptable and fundamentally democratic—even when democracy itself is not. Most of these artists faced prejudice or hardship of varying severity, which naturally informed their music. ""Police they arrest me, materialists detest me,"" Willie Dunn sings on ""I Pity the Country"". ""Pollution it chokes me, movies they joke me."" The impression is one of forced isolation, as though society has stripped away every refuge that might comfort the singer—except music, that is. It’s a startling opener to the comp, especially since Dunn’s steadfast voice conveys resignation more than anger. He’s not fighting the system, but pitying the sad men who perpetuate their own unhappiness.</p>
<p>""I Pity the Country"" is not too different from the politically-motivated folk, rock, and country coming out of the North American mainstream at that time. Many of the artists on <i>Native North America</i> were weaned on early country &amp; western, in particular the lonesome ballads of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"">Hank Williams</a>, but their music has more in common, both sonically and politically, with that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26085-buffy-sainte-marie/"">Buffy Sainte-Marie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Johnny Cash</a> (whose 1964 album <i>Bitter Tears</i> looms large over this set, even if it is never mentioned). Tribal drums become a rock'n'roll rhythm section on Lloyd Cheechoo’s ""James Bay"" and ""Tshekuan Mak Tshetutamak"" by Groupe Folklorique Montagnais, a powerful means of announcing the artists’ aboriginal roots. The Chieftones (who billed themselves as ""Canada’s All Indian Band"") kick off ""I Shouldn’t Have Did What I Done"" with a drum pattern practically quoted from some cheesy old Hollywood Western, but it turns out to be more than just a marketing ploy as the band’s energetic garage-rock attack subverts any expectation of stoicism associated with Aboriginal stereotypes.</p>
<p>The idea of pop music as a means of presenting oneself to the world gives <i>Native North America</i> some cohesion despite the range of ethnicities, geographies, and genres represented in its tracklist. The comp celebrates those distinctions even if it can’t quite underscore them, which means the extensive liner notes become a crucial guide for listening. A problem that affects so many compilations becomes especially acute<i>:</i> You not only want to hear more songs by these artists, but also want to hear more songs in their original context. How did Willy Mitchell expand on the folksy urgency of ""Call of the Moose"" for his 1981 album <i>Sweet Grass Music? </i>Does the rest of the Saddle Lake Drifting Cowboys’ material sound as good as the Ventures-meets-Buckaroos ""Modern Rock""? And what about the 1981 comp <i>Goose Wings: The Music of James Bay</i>, which includes tunes by Lawrence Martin, Lloyd Cheechoo, and Brian Davey? Of course, stoking your curiosity about underrepresented artists only means <i>Native North America</i> is doing its job.</p></div>"|19986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19986-various-artists-native-north-america-vol-1-aboriginal-folk-rock-and-country-19661985/|7.9|Stephen M.

Shepheard may appreciate the need for discriminating tastes and efficient technical know-how more than most—before founding Retrofit, he worked for several years in the vaults of online retailer Juno Records, indexing crate after crate of music as it arrived. His savvy ear was one of the chief pleasures of <i>Home &amp; Garden</i>, which showcased Shepheard’s contemporary visions of piano-driven garage, tech house, and starry-eyed nu-disco in compact four-and-a-half-minute bursts. But it also sounded a little tight-fisted, the work of a skilled producer powering through the uncertainty of being his own label boss.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Shepheard’s new album, <i>Seeing Sound</i>, is the result of a slight relaxation of those aesthetic strictures. It’s a looser set of eight sprawled-out house tracks that wisely taps Shepheard’s skills as a singles producer (something he honed on a series of six 12'' releases for Compost’s Black Label, the most successful of which was the nocturnal fantasy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUXNYHKQw04"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pipes N Sneakers""</a>.) Despite hitting many of the same touchstones, it feels more thematically consistent than his last effort.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Shepheard's typically dry style, which borrows much of its artificial surface character from analog techno, is fully present here—""Mover Friendly"" is an almost parodically twitched-out version of a ghetto house stomp, while ""One Day City""'s classic disco riff comes in harsh, electronic plunks.</span></p>
<p><i>Seeing Sound</i><span> also features some of Shepheard's most creative vocal manipulations, which add an extra-human element to music already soaked in technical manipulation. ""Dance Language"" features a heavily filtered gurgle that's eerily ambiguous, while the irrepressibly fun ""Mover Friendly"", with its fractured stutters and mumbles, is a master class on expressive post-verbal vocal sampling. Shepheard is no traditionalist, despite his use of familiar styles; on </span><span><i>Seeing Sound</i>, </span><span>his interpretations fuse those sounds with the techno-anxiety of recycled culture and Internet-native music, subtly expanding house music’s sound by situating it firmly in the present.</span></p></div>"|19947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19947-jay-shepheard-seeing-sound/|7.6|Abby Garnett

Which makes sense for an artist prone to world travels and crafting a strain of music that acts as a peregrination through numerous musical forms of the late 20th century: free jazz, progressive rock, drone, tape-loop based minimalism, electroacoustic composition, field recordings, new age meditations, and more. His name crops up as a sideman for the likes of bossa nova guitarist Baden Powell, Belgian pop crooner Salvatore Adamo, and prog rock guitarist Richard Pinhas, while his own recorded works are ludicrously rare, released in small batches that now fetch astronomical sums online. Saying that Ariel Kalma is underappreciated isn’t quite right in that most of his work remains unheard.</p>
<p>As is their wont, <a href=""http://igetrvng.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RVNG Intl.</a>’s reassessment of Kalma seeks to correct that imbalance, not by just reissuing such rarities as 1975’s <i>Le Temps des Moissons</i> or the strange hybrid of jungle field recordings and body-elevating drones on 1978’s <i>Osmose</i>, but by encouraging the composer himself to unlock old boxes of tapes and reevaluate whatever little treasures were left behind. So while much of Kalma’s released music aims towards the infinite, with compositions taking up the entire side of vinyl records and often surpassing the nine-minute mark, <i>An Evolutionary Music</i> is rather concise: 15 of the 17 tracks are under seven minutes while two of the standouts are also the longest.</p>
<p>Kalma’s bio—as detailed in the liner notes—finds him aligned with similarly-minded musical travelers. At one point, he worked at Paris’s iconic INA-GRM Studio, the birthplace of 20th century electronic music. Busking on the streets of New York City in the 1970s, he encountered another world music fuser in Don Cherry and also came into contact with American minimalist Terry Riley. Those two might be the closest comparisons for Kalma’s own music. In 1971, Kalma—already having picked up flute and saxophone—acquired a reel-to-reel tape machine and holed up in his Montparnasse flat, began making home recordings that explored tape feedback, echo, and his own voice. Some of these earliest recordings, like ""Les Mots de Tous Les Jours (Rêves Etranges)"" and ""Les Etoiles Sont Allumées"" appear here, short and exploratory, interesting primarily for what they indicate lays ahead.</p>
<p>Similarly succinct as these spoken word pieces, ""Enuej Elleiv"" hints at Kalma’s fusion of free jazz, experimental electronics, and the timbre of esoteric instruments from around the world. Kalma plays harmonium and saxophone and takes collaborator Dominique Regef’s hurdy-gurdy and sends it through an extreme amount of phase, giving the song a phantasmal, shifting sound that carries you far afield in under three minutes. His work with primitive drum machines also provides for interesting fragments like ""Chase Me Now"" and ""Voltage Controlled Wave"".</p>
<p>""In 1974 and 1975 I had some very strong experiences of oneness with the universe."" So Kalma is quoted in <i>Evolutionary Music</i>’s liner notes and his travels took him through India, Afghanistan, Turkey, and Israel, where he picked up strange stringed instruments and mastered the art of circular breathing. That latter technique dilated the range and duration of his horn improvisations. With his never-ending horn drones in motion with his own tape machine, he began to find a peaceful, unmoored sound. Some of these early combinations appear here as ""Almora Sunrise"", while the expansive 10 minutes of ""Ecstasy Musical Mind Yoga"" show him the French equivalent to Riley’s all night flights.</p>
<p>Some pieces seem promising in their mesmerism, but don’t hang around long enough to fully take effect, instead coming across as detours rather than full-fledged trips. Kalma’s own ""Love and Dream"" reminds me of Laraaji (another such cosmic artist recently reassessed) but in a smaller dosage. Only on the 19-minute tapestry ""Yogini Breath"", which Kalma developed for use with a friend’s breath therapy work, does the true scope of his sonic vision come into full view.

But the Velvet Underground are the only band to have released multiple self-titled debuts.</p>
<p>Technically, their first album was 1967’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17129-the-velvet-underground-nico/"">The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</a></i>, a bracing collision of Brill Building pop classicism and avant-garde noise terrorism that, by the time <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18770-the-velvet-underground-white-lightwhite-heat/"">White Light/White Heat</a> </i>was released in 1968, had progressed to all-out warfare. The tension at the heart of these two records has often been attributed to the oppositional approaches of its principal songwriters—<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickwick_Records#History"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">professional popsmith</a> Lou Reed and viola-scraping iconoclast John Cale—though this reading has always been reductive. After all, Cale delivered one of <i>White Light/White Heat</i>’s few moments of serenity (""Lady Godiva’s Operation""), while Reed unleashed the album’s most brutalizing shock 53 seconds into ""I Heard Her Call My Name"". But for Reed, the only logical response to <i>White Light/White Heat</i>’s anti-pop extremism was to ricochet back in the other direction, a move that would force Cale out of the Velvets and present Reed with the opportunity to lead a different kind of band. </p>
<p>The romantic myth about the Velvets—the commercially ignored, ahead-of-their-time proto-punk innovators proudly out of step with the peace'n'lovey-dovey pop of the day—often overlooks a crucial quality about the band: they actually wanted to be popular. And in light of disappointing sales for their first two albums on niche jazz imprint Verve, they traded up to parent company MGM in 1969 with the intention of being a proper rock band that makes records for big labels in Hollywood and stays at the Chateau Marmont. </p>
<p>From the very first second of <i>The Velvet Underground</i>, everything about the group had changed from where they left off with the epochal squall of <i>White</i> <i>Light/White Heat</i>’s ""Sister Ray"". Reed and Sterling Morrison’s amp settings were dialed down from 11 to 1; Maureen ""Moe"" Tucker’s thundering thump was softened into a breezy brushed-snare sway; and Reed’s ding-dong-sucking snarl was replaced by the melancholic whisper of Cale’s successor Doug Yule. It’s like returning from a holiday only to find your rat-infested apartment building had burned down and been replaced with a white-picket-fenced bungalow. And even though the song Yule was crooning, ""Candy Says"", marked Reed’s first explicit character reference to the Warhol Factory scene that birthed his band, it ultimately underscored the Velvets’ increasing remove from its hazy decadence: A devastatingly intimate portrait of then-transitioning Factory regular Candy Darling, ""Candy Says"" is the sobering soundtrack for that inevitable moment when all tomorrow’s parties turn to morning-after, makeup-smeared, self-loathing introspection. (The album cover reinforces the reflective mood: though shot at the Factory, the Velvets look more like they’re hosting a small gathering friends in their living room, their '67-era striped tees and fuck-you wraparound shades replaced by comfortable sweaters and sensible collared shirts.)</p>
<p>If <i>The Velvet Underground</i>dialled down the aggression and abrasion of its predecessors, it undercuts the mellow approach with some of the rawest songwriting of Reed’s career, and a plainspoken candor as startling as his past meditations on smack and S&amp;M. His blunt language drives a spike into the album’s gentle jangle to unleash a maelstrom of emotions, where ecstatic moments of spiritual reawakening (""Beginning to See the Light"") are answered by cruel reality checks (""I’m set free/ To find a new illusion""), where the love of his life becomes someone else's (""Pale Blue Eyes""), where a Jewish guy feels so fucked up, he starts praying to Jesus. Even the seemingly easy-going choogle of ""What Goes On"" is routinely upset by Reed’s admissions of anxiety (""One minute born/ One minute doomed""). By that token, the simultaneous-poetry experiment ""The Murder Mystery"" feels less like an anomalous WTF throwback to the Velvets’ avant-garde roots than the sound of the album’s slow-stewing inner turmoil coming to a boil.</p>
<p>This interiority complex was crucial to Reed, to the point of him taking the original recordings engineered by MGM house producer Val Valentin and remixing the entire album to bring the already unguarded vocals to the fore. This so-called ""Closet Mix""—featuring an entirely different, more cerebral take on the blues soliloquy ""Some Kinda Love""— initially appeared only on the album’s first U.S. run; it would later resurface on the 1995 career-spanning box set <i>Peel Slowly and See</i>. This 45th-anniversary package not only revives Reed’s Closet Mix alongside a new crystalline mix by Valentin, but also a third mono version that could very well be dubbed the Armoire Mix, thus making the transition out of <i>White Light/White Heat</i> feel a little less abrupt. (For one, the once-blissful fade-out organ drone on ""What Goes On"" now sounds like a ray-gun burrowing into your skull.) Which mix you prefer depends on just how cozy you want to get with the Velvets: would you rather they engage you in a private, face-to-face conversation (Valentin’s mix), whisper in your ear (Closet Mix), or take up residency inside your brain (the mono mix)? </p>
<p>But <i>The Velvet Underground</i>’s six-disc deluxe edition has a purpose beyond just encouraging audiophiles to A/B different versions of the same songs. Rather, it’s a complete portrait of a period when the Velvets’ populist ambitions were being matched by their exceedingly prolific output, and the notion of what we now consider to be the archetypal Lou Reed song—be it a tough, streetwise rocker or tender, empathetic ballad—was being more clearly defined. Shortly after <i>The Velvet Underground</i>’s March 1969 release, the band had recorded enough new material at New York’s Record Plant for a fourth album; souring relations with MGM, however, resulted in those sessions being shelved. This material has, of course, surfaced in various iterations over the years (be it on mid-'80s compilations <i>VU</i> and <i>Another View</i>, the <i>Peel Slowly and See</i> box, or in revised form on various Reed solo albums), and has proven as canonical as the band’s officially released work. But this set is the first to present it as a proper, logically sequenced, stand-alone album, kicking off with the locomotive charge of ""Foggy Notion"" and ending with an instrumental version of ""Ride Into the Sun"" that, here, feels less like an unfinished demo than a strategically placed closing-credits theme.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that these songs count as the most upbeat and playful the Velvets produced; as Yule observes in David Fricke’s liner notes, ""There was a type of song that Lou wrote that was not thematically important to him, but was fun to put together, that had a lot of rhythm—a good tune when you needed something to open up an audience."" The last two discs of this set—pulled from two November '69 shows at San Francisco club The Matrix—present a glorious opportunity to experience this engagement process in action. This period of the band’s onstage evolution has been documented on the 1974 double-album <i>1969: The Velvet Underground Live</i> and the no-fi bootleg comp <i>The Quine Tapes</i>, but never with such cohesion and clarity. (The Matrix—owned by Jefferson Airplane singer Marty Balin—boasted a professional four-track console at its mixing desk.) </p>
<p>While San Francisco’s hippie haven may have seemed like enemy turf for the Velvets, the city was essentially the band’s home away from home for much of '69, The Matrix their Factory West. And the rollicking performances betray their desire to out-jam the jam bands, and expose the rock ‘n’ roll heart beating through even the Velvets’ most transgressive songs. The cornerstone is a ""Sister Ray"" to end all ""Sister Ray""s, though its 37(!)-minute roller coaster journey from a molasses-slow blues to heart-racing rave-up is hitched to a relaxed West Coast groove that ventures far away from the original’s distortion holocaust. And the Velvets take such liberties in stretching out and reshaping their most concise songs (""Waiting for the Man"", ""Lisa Says"", ""There She Goes Again""), that the faithful rendition of first-album freak-out ""Heroin"" practically sounds formalist in comparison. (That said, even when in crowd-pleasing mode, Reed was already plotting future provocations: Prior to kicking into a distended early version of ""Rock &amp; Roll"", Reed strums a droning warm-up chord, and marvels, ""imagine <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Machine_Music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a hundred guitars doing that at once</a>!"")</p>
<p>Alas, the obvious joy with which the band whip through the Matrix setlist obscures the sad truth about <i>The Velvet Underground</i>: that the Velvets’ concerted ""pop"" album turned out to be the biggest commercial flop of their career up to that point, not even able to scrape the bottom reaches of the Billboard 200, as its two more caustic predecessors barely managed to do. When the band sing in unison, ""How does it feel to be loved?"" at the end of the Matrix take on ""Beginning to See the Light"", Lou ad libs, ""somebody tell me, PLEASE!"" with an amplified sense of desperation that indicates he never thought he’d know the answer. But just as <i>The Velvet Underground</i>’s hushed tones and tempered tempos demanded a greater sense of patience from listeners, its acceptance proved to be a protracted, gradual process that took decades.</p>
<p>The band’s first two albums prefigured punk, goth, and contemporary noise, but <i>The Velvet Underground</i> anticipated the sound of popular indie rock from the late-'80s onward, through the barb-wired chime of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"">Galaxie 500</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>, and countless others; the entire <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> discography can be heard in the outro of ""What Goes On"" alone, while even the Moe Tucker-sung confection ""After Hours"" (and its '69-session counterpart ""I’m Sticking With You"") single-handedly spawned <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/07/the-twee-revolution/372273/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">all things twee</a>. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Brian Eno famously quipped that everyone who bought </span><i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> started a band, but </span><i>The Velvet Underground</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">'s stunning simplicity and unflinching honesty presented an even more accessible model of DIY aspiration, free of Warholian conceptualism and Cale’s classically schooled chaos.

Even its unheralded album tracks hit a sweet spot of purposeful insouciance that promised a career in the spotlight. With songs selected and sequenced largely by Young Chop, <i>Finally Rich</i> is a creative success (if only a modest commercial one) because it sells Chief Keef as a hitmaker. In the pre-Internet industry, perhaps that's just what he would be. But today his interests lie elsewhere, and his path since has been a defiant refutation of any direction but his own.</p>
<p>To make a case for Chief Keef’s more recent music is to wander into a catch–22. Though short, defensive explanations (""he’s got good hooks,"" ""it’s just turn-up music"") are tempting, they undersell his breadth; any lengthy defense is dismissed out of hand for overthinking music unworthy of the attention. But Chief Keef has not only sustained creatively in the waning spotlight of his initial breakthrough, he’s become one of the more original young voices in hip-hop. Over the course of the past two years, his music has been in a state of continual reinvention. His latest tape, <i>Back From the Dead 2</i>, is a bold step in a dark new direction. Largely self-produced, it again redefines his sound, pushes his rapping to the foreground, and makes his older records—including the recent <i>Big Gucci Sosa</i>, much of which was recorded more than a year ago—seem quaint.</p>
<p>Though reminiscent of his earlier rap style, <i>Big Gucci Sosa</i> is a mediocre record, and shows the futility of pining for Chief Keef’s supposed golden era of 2012. Admittedly, his biggest records from this time had an immediacy that trumped everything else out there. But <i>Big Gucci Sosa</i> lacks the songwriting of peaks like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWyHZNBz6FE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love Sosa""</a>, parachuting Keef verses into the one-dimensional pulp-gangster formula that’s been Gucci Mane’s collaborative stock in trade since 2011. Not that Keef is the album’s weak link. On standout ""Darker"" (which has been in circulation for at least a year), Keef completely washes his mentor.</p>
<p>He stands out again on ""Paper"", the only song on both <i>Big Gucci Sosa</i> and <i>Back From the Dead 2</i>, if only for a callback to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a>’s infamous ""lasagna"" lyric (this one’s about spaghetti). Thankfully, it’s the only pro forma trap record on the latter tape. Sixteen of <i>BFTD2</i>’s 20 tracks are produced by Chief Keef himself. For his first steps into rapper-producer territory, he shows promise—though it’s tough to imagine most of these beats working outside the context of a Chief Keef album, as they are primed to frame his vocals. He’s cultivated a consistent sound; each beat is of-a-piece, with brooding synthesized string and chorale patches moving in beefy quarter notes to conjure a grim yet electric atmosphere. <span>Where the production on 2013's </span><i>Almighty So</i><span> had the </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9U5NXN-MQc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pace</a><span> and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp44glOOFlk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bleary</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp4KTFsxPls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">color</a><span> of city lights sliding up a rain-drenched windshield, </span><i>Back From the Dead 2</i><span> prowls through back alleys, preferring gritty textures and coiled energy.</span></p>
<p>In jazz improvisation, there’s a saying that if you screw up, make sure to do it loud—a confident mistake isn’t really a mistake at all. In keeping with this notion, Keef’s production has an amateurism-as-aesthetic element not unlike late ‘90s Swizz Beatz records. The seams show—cymbals take a full beat to decay, waveforms distort, and though he conveys a range of moods, he doesn’t yet have the facility for much rhythmic variation. But Keef’s commitment to the beats’ functional effect blurs the line between ""mistake"" and mastery—whether through misunderstanding, willful mutation, or both, there’s a savviness and sophistication to the album’s sound. Like many aspects of his musical approach, his conviction makes the unconventional connect.</p>
<p>The main sonic shift from his recent work to this tape is rhythmic. Through loosies released to iTunes and YouTube, Keef’s 2014 output varied from the sudden roller coaster effects of the low-pass filter (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU6LIljeeME"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gucci Gang""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2AiXV3rYpA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sosa Style""</a>) to the intricate, nimble rhythms of 12hunna’s production (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy4nRbGqJRo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hundreds""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aYdVVijhi8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Make It Count""</a>). On <i>Back From the Dead 2</i>, tracks like ""Whole Crowd"" and ""Wheres Waldo"" seem to float forward, while more groove-driven records like ""Farm"", ""Sets"", and “Wayne” are relentless, creeping ahead on four-beats-per-bar tip-toes. It’s not monochromatic; ""Faneto"" has the feel of a<i> </i>'70s Chinatown sequence, ""The Moral"" sounds like music from <i>Castlevania</i>, and “Blurry” is all searing exultation. But when compared with this summer’s dynamic, uptempo sound, Keef’s beats are deliberate, the grooves often static—creating a stark contrasting canvas for the dynamism of his delivery.</p>
<p>Keef's rapping holds the project together. His earliest records, like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS8OMv8VF70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Everydays Halloween""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg9mJEE5PeQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""John Madden""</a>, hit particularly hard because of a central contradiction: his voice was at once an unbothered flatline and a tool of projection. Keef had Gucci Mane’s nonchalant flow, but his voice popped to the front of the speaker without sacrificing that sense of effortlessness. As he’s evolved, Keef’s detached from that behind-the-beat pocket and shifted to a more aggressive style—one freed from the rhythmic grid other artists treat as a requisite constraint, without being untethered from it altogether, a la certain <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a> releases. This unpredictability lends a chaotic tension to the music.</p>
<p>His lyrics are more effective for their blunt economy—he gets more mileage per syllable (as on the cleverly brutal ""Faneto"": ""Talkin’ out his neck, pistol to his throat/ Blow this motherfucker, he gon’ choke""). He’s unafraid to use space, preferring the compositional effect of short burst phrases, rather than long, familiar cadences. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"">E–40</a>’s new single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zbw3KzgHBU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Choices (Yup)""</a> is an example of a more traditional rapper working in this style.) Like King Louie, he will lock into a particular pattern for several lines, using extreme slant rhymes (""I just hit a stain, finagle/ I just hit a stain, finito""), as if trying to demolish the distance between words themselves, or to camouflage his thoughts. He’s made rhyming a word with itself into an art form of its own—he likes to complete the circuit early, or to let words stay static while the meaning shifts (""Nigga don’t slip, you lose it, then you lose it"").</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, critics have suggested Keef was a diminished version of every rapper from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"">Waka</a> to Lil B to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy/"">Soulja Boy</a>. These comparisons now seem absurd; grappling to describe something truly new, we look to the past, and inevitably fall short. Today, Chief Keef is in rarefied air for street rap—a creative voice with an original, cohesive aesthetic. True, in the media spotlight, interest in him is at low ebb: for a certain hipper music listener, he’s not weird enough, eclipsed by the gender-bending, manic Lil Wayne disciple <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>. For hip-hop heads, Keef is <i>too</i> weird—and so we end up with a straightlaced (if energetic) street rapper named Bobby Shmurda. Yet to the grassroots, among a new generation of stars, he sits at street rap’s aesthetic center, not its margins.</p>
<p>The subtext of this music remains deeply bleak; there are numerous shouts to his murdered cousin, and it’s extremely disconcerting how casually Chicago rappers refer to kush blunts by the names of fallen enemies. Yet at its heart, there’s a playfulness, both explicit (""I can cut my dreads and sell them on Ebay"") and artistic—witness the poetic run-on about money midway through ""Wheres Waldo"". He plays his own narrative close to the vest, letting his story loom below his elliptical rhymes like ice cubes in a glass. Nonetheless, moments of clarity burst through suddenly, crackling with significance: ""And I’m still rollin’ dice, no monopoly/ I can’t be controlled, this ain’t no colony."" That line comes from ""Wayne"", which sounds like a hit rap single turned inside-out to reveal its rotten core—Rae Sremmurd’s evil antithesis. Malevolent and psychedelic, <i>Back From the Dead 2</i> is Chief Keef’s own <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZ5mc9yQ7Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Down 2 Tha Last Roach""</a> blown out to album-length proportions.</p></div>"|20027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20027-chief-keef-gucci-mane-back-from-the-dead-2big-gucci-sosa/|7.8|David Drake

It’s not monochromatic; ""Faneto"" has the feel of a<i> </i>'70s Chinatown sequence, ""The Moral"" sounds like music from <i>Castlevania</i>, and “Blurry” is all searing exultation. But when compared with this summer’s dynamic, uptempo sound, Keef’s beats are deliberate, the grooves often static—creating a stark contrasting canvas for the dynamism of his delivery.</p>
<p>Keef's rapping holds the project together. His earliest records, like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS8OMv8VF70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Everydays Halloween""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg9mJEE5PeQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""John Madden""</a>, hit particularly hard because of a central contradiction: his voice was at once an unbothered flatline and a tool of projection. Keef had Gucci Mane’s nonchalant flow, but his voice popped to the front of the speaker without sacrificing that sense of effortlessness. As he’s evolved, Keef’s detached from that behind-the-beat pocket and shifted to a more aggressive style—one freed from the rhythmic grid other artists treat as a requisite constraint, without being untethered from it altogether, a la certain <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a> releases. This unpredictability lends a chaotic tension to the music.</p>
<p>His lyrics are more effective for their blunt economy—he gets more mileage per syllable (as on the cleverly brutal ""Faneto"": ""Talkin’ out his neck, pistol to his throat/ Blow this motherfucker, he gon’ choke""). He’s unafraid to use space, preferring the compositional effect of short burst phrases, rather than long, familiar cadences. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"">E–40</a>’s new single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zbw3KzgHBU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Choices (Yup)""</a> is an example of a more traditional rapper working in this style.) Like King Louie, he will lock into a particular pattern for several lines, using extreme slant rhymes (""I just hit a stain, finagle/ I just hit a stain, finito""), as if trying to demolish the distance between words themselves, or to camouflage his thoughts. He’s made rhyming a word with itself into an art form of its own—he likes to complete the circuit early, or to let words stay static while the meaning shifts (""Nigga don’t slip, you lose it, then you lose it"").</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, critics have suggested Keef was a diminished version of every rapper from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"">Waka</a> to Lil B to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy/"">Soulja Boy</a>. These comparisons now seem absurd; grappling to describe something truly new, we look to the past, and inevitably fall short. Today, Chief Keef is in rarefied air for street rap—a creative voice with an original, cohesive aesthetic. True, in the media spotlight, interest in him is at low ebb: for a certain hipper music listener, he’s not weird enough, eclipsed by the gender-bending, manic Lil Wayne disciple <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>. For hip-hop heads, Keef is <i>too</i> weird—and so we end up with a straightlaced (if energetic) street rapper named Bobby Shmurda. Yet to the grassroots, among a new generation of stars, he sits at street rap’s aesthetic center, not its margins.</p>
<p>The subtext of this music remains deeply bleak; there are numerous shouts to his murdered cousin, and it’s extremely disconcerting how casually Chicago rappers refer to kush blunts by the names of fallen enemies. Yet at its heart, there’s a playfulness, both explicit (""I can cut my dreads and sell them on Ebay"") and artistic—witness the poetic run-on about money midway through ""Wheres Waldo"". He plays his own narrative close to the vest, letting his story loom below his elliptical rhymes like ice cubes in a glass. Nonetheless, moments of clarity burst through suddenly, crackling with significance: ""And I’m still rollin’ dice, no monopoly/ I can’t be controlled, this ain’t no colony."" That line comes from ""Wayne"", which sounds like a hit rap single turned inside-out to reveal its rotten core—Rae Sremmurd’s evil antithesis. Malevolent and psychedelic, <i>Back From the Dead 2</i> is Chief Keef’s own <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZ5mc9yQ7Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Down 2 Tha Last Roach""</a> blown out to album-length proportions.</p></div>"|20027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20027-chief-keef-gucci-mane-back-from-the-dead-2big-gucci-sosa/|5.0|David Drake

Pouring himself into the Machinedrum project has served Stewart well over the past five years or so, as he became one of <a href=""http://ninjatune.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ninja Tune</a>'s best known and beloved artists on the back of 2013's memorable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18513-machine-drum-vapor-city/""><i>Vapor City</i></a> LP. But his success has allowed him to inundate excitable fans with music, and Stewart is a poor self-editor. His <i>Vapor City Archives</i> record is the culmination of a year spent stretching an album cycle to its limits with a world tour, multiple EPs, an interactive website, a digital subscription service, and just about every other trick in the marketing book. So there's precious little he can share that we haven't already heard in a variety of forms.</p>
<p>Though he's dabbled in hip-hop, IDM, and house, Machinedrum hasn't really switched up his sound since he discovered Chicago's fertile juke and footwork scene. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15621-rooms/""><i>Room(s)</i></a> from 2011 was the first LP to fully manifest the style that has come to define Stewart's solo output—whiplash tempos, 808 drums, heavy bass, bright synths, and <i>loads</i> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>-like vocal samples. To this formula, <i>Vapor City</i> added acoustic guitar, Amen breaks, and the producer's own voice. Once a mercurial experimentalist, Machinedrum now refines what's already there, an approach certain electronic artists would do well to follow. So it's no surprise <i>Vapor City Archives</i> operates on that wavelength. But where the two previous albums were drawn from different sessions, this 10-song collection is culled from the same material as its namesake. The quality gives <i>Archives</i> a lingering sense of déjà vu; even if the tracks don't sound <i>exactly</i> like their <i>Vapor City</i> counterparts, they sure as hell remind you of them.</p>
<p>To his credit, though, Machinedrum does fit a few updates into the tracklist. ""B Patient"", for example, juggles speaker-toasting bassweight and a cloud of emotive guitar and vocal figures with reinvigorated flair. Then there are the fizzy vocal hooks and dayglo pads of ""More Than Friends"", which make a great case for Stewart taking his breezy jungle/footwork concoction into the dance-pop realm. On the other hand, ""Hard 2 Be""'s choppy synth stabs and tumbling drum patterns are dead ringers for a handful of the hyped-up singles on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/""><i>Sepalcure</i></a>, the eponymous 2011 album from Machinedrum's and Praveen Sharma's collaborative project. ""Vizion (Centered)"" is the most blatantly recycled of the bunch, a near facsimile of <i>Vapor City</i>'s mid-album interlude in both name and mood. Flawlessly produced and unmistakable as it is, <i>Vapor City Archives </i>repurposes sounds and ideas from across Stewart's repertoire, setting up well-versed fans to trainspot similarities over any kind of immersive listening.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-8701b520-c46a-3a8d-037f-a776b72eaf3a"">If the abundance of music Machinedrum has put his name on in the past year is any indication, he could probably make these kinds of wistful, breaks-addled, post-dubstep/footwork/bass music hybrids while he files his taxes or cooks a nice dinner. Stewart's increased output and dearth of exploration gives <i>Archives</i> an unflattering offhandedness, and it also dilutes the potency of <i>Vapor City</i>, like putting together an album is just another item to mark off his to-do list. </span></p></div>"|19983.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19983-machine-drum-vapor-city-archives/|5.8|Patric Fallon

Over their 40-plus years of morphing, discontinuous existence, they’ve been so good at dodging expectations and confounding analysis that even when they’re playing it straight, you wonder if something else is going on. So when the press sheet for <i><span>j US t </span></i>(pronounced ""just us"") claims the band is ""inviting the whole world to use [the album] as a base on which to build their own music,"" it’s hard not to get suspicious. Is this a decoy? Do Jean-Hervé Peron and Zappi Diermaier want you to imagine other music so you won’t focus on theirs? Is it simply a way to say ""if you don’t like it, make your own""?</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Perhaps Faust truly are earnest about wanting this album to inspire public collaboration. But the idea does point to something that’s always been intriguing about Faust’s music: it’s often just as much about what they aren’t playing as what they are. Their work is full of implications and innuendos, spaces waiting to be filled in.  </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>j US t</i> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">doesn’t necessarily have more of that than most Faust albums, but implication does seem to be a main theme here. This is music in which every note suggests many more possibilities.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>j US t</i><span> begins by proclaiming more than intimating, and in this way it bears an uncanny resemblance to the last Faust effort, 2011’s stellar </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15150-something-dirty/"">Something Dirty</a></i><span>. That record began with three bold, practically rocking tunes, and so does this one. Based around simple riffs and looping beats, these songs are like free-form post-rock, sturdy in their rhythms but opened-ended in their direction. And despite how well-defined the base of each track is, there’s also tantalizing space in each one. Take ""80Hz"", whose simple two-note bass figure flows beautifully with the well-timed accents of Diermaier’s percussion and Peron’s sonic grab bag. At times it dips to near-silence, in other places it crests to frantic peaks, but throughout it maintains a tension that compels attention.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The balance between action and suggestion tips more toward the latter for the rest of </span><span><i>j US t</i>, </span><span>in ways both fascinating and frustrating. Some songs maintain the attraction of anticipation, hinting at where they might go without ever fully abandoning other options. But others feel more flat than ripe, not so much flirting with tense silence as drifting into empty inertia. One in particular, the seven-minute ""Palpitations"", is mostly limp. Its intermittent percussion and electronic squiggles sound more random than impulsive, making it the only instance on the album where I find myself wishing I could already hear other bands filling it in. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It takes a few tracks to recover from that mid-album drop, but Faust manage to rebound on closer ""Ich Sitze Immer Noch"", whose slow, rising lope sounds like a sunny homage to </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"">Spiderland</a>-</i><span>era </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/""><span>Slint</span></a><span>. Like the bulk of </span><i>j US t</i><span>, it offers a lot worth hearing and just as much worth daydreaming about—in other words, it achieves the band's stated goals. Maybe Peron and Diermaier really did mean what they said.</span></p></div>"|19921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19921-faust-j-us-t/|6.8|Marc Masters

It sounds like a prompt from Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Oblique Strategies</i></a>, but really it's the artist Barnt, aka Daniel Ansorge, explaining his creative process in an interview with Amsterdam's <a href=""http://www.trouwamsterdam.nl/nl/blog/2014/11/cosmic/1330/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trouw</a> nightclub. ""It's like our love for the blue ribbon in the sky,"" he continues. ""Do we want to catch it? Or do we want to let it fly away?""</p>
<p>It's not surprising to hear Ansorge speak in riddles and abstractions, because the trappings of his music follow suit. Ansorge is a co-founder of Cologne's <a href=""http://www.magazine.mu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Magazine</a> label—or, sorry, not a label, but ""a depot and a serial publication of contemporary contributions."" Magazine's sleeves, which look like they've been pieced together with images clipped from out-of-date textbooks, might pass for pages from <i>Artforum</i>. Likewise, Barnt's titles might as well be culled from scraps of paper found on the sidewalk, or from spambots' emails: cryptic fragments with the sterile whiff of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry (""All the alts I'mm holding are hurting."" (sic), ""Wiggett: So we know that hexog****"", ""How Do I Know What Solutions X Form?""), whose very refusal to express anything is itself weirdly expressive.</p>
<p>As arch as all this may seem, Barnt's music is hardly short on emotion, which is just as you'd expect of a techno producer schooled in krautrock and <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a>. ""Collection"", from his debut EP in 2010, was a haunting house track poised halfway between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4074-superpitcher/"">Superpitcher</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32608-john-carpenter/"">John Carpenter</a>. On the same record, ""What Is a Number, That a Man May Know It?"" paired naïve synthesizer melodies with piledriver kicks to surprisingly moving effect. ""Libretto"", compiled on Kompakt's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15043-pop-ambient-2011/""><i>Pop Ambient 2011</i></a>, conjured absent-minded melancholy out of rubbed wineglass rims. And his singles ""Geffen"" and ""Tunsten"", for the <a href=""http://www.musicacomeme.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cómeme</a> label, spun minimal techno into gonzo Casiotone freakouts, all seesawing chromatic sequences and dog-whistle octave play.</p>
<p>That said, Barnt's take on dance music is marked by a strange kind of clinical remove. It's not that his tracks don't work on the dancefloor—they definitely do, often in the most deranged way possible—but there's always a sense of something slightly <i>off</i> about them. If techno is supposed to be the meeting of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6208-george-clinton/"">George Clinton</a> in an elevator, then Barnt's music is an encounter between those artists' waxy avatars on the floor of Madame Tussauds. If hyperintelligent extraterrestrials were to recreate the sound of earthling dance music after 30 years of observing us through telescopes, their algorithmic reconstructions might come out sounding something like Barnt's recent 12"" for Will Bankhead and Joy Orbison's Hinge Finger label in which shuddering drum sequences and EBM bass synths hammer away, without pause or variation, as long as the vinyl will let them.</p>
<p>With his debut album, Barnt continues to tease out the contradictory impulses—as stone-faced romantic and lab-coated hedonist—that make his work so compelling. His kit remains the same as always: cheapish-sounding synthesizers, usually no more than one or two per track, and outmoded drum machines with the tempo knob seemingly permanently soldered to the 120 beats-per-minute mark. He's fond of tinny, bit-crushed hi-hats and quavering tremolo leads; save for a little reverb here or there, there are few obvious effects in play. It is a dry, almost deadpan sound.</p>
<p>The repetitive nature of Barnt's music, with its steadily cycling arpeggios and constant pedal tones, has led some listeners to connect it with the ""kosmische"" tradition of German synthesizer music of the '70s and '80s, but one of the great pleasures of Barnt's work is how modest it is, built of cheap plastic and low-grade metal and cracked rubber fittings. As interstellar metaphors go, this isn't the hi-def sci-fi of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>'s spaceship; it's more like the paltry 64-kilobyte memory of the <a href=""http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Apollo-11-The-computers-that-put-man-on-the-moon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Apollo Guidance Computer</a>.</p>
<p>The bulk of the album is devoted to five longish tracks, none shorter than six-and-a-half minutes long, and one that's more than 15, in which cautious melodies and economical counterpoints rise and fall above stolid four-to-the-floor beats. (Three short interludes serve as palate-cleansers; their single-keyboard riffing recalls a kid trying out synths in the music shop—dreamy, wistful little airs that bridge classical schooling and solid-state circuitry.) To enumerate their elements is even more useless than usual when discussing club tracks. The leads tend to be reedy, spindly things, and the drum sounds lumpy and leaden; there are almost no basslines to speak of. Pedal tones and open fifths are par for the course. All the elements go out of their way to be unremarkable; it's the way they come together that really sings.</p>
<p>In ""22:25"", a strident, two-note pizzicato sequence saws dully away until it's relieved by lowing choral samples. The opening ""Wiggett: So we know that hexog****"" plays hypnotic counterpoints against cricket-legged hi-hats and insistent splash cymbals. ""How Do I Know What Solutions X Form?"" balances Medieval European and Middle Eastern influences over an Italo-disco bassline. ""Cherry Red"", one of the album's best tracks, works as a kind of relay race, as a nervous, 16th-note patter is passed from voice to voice—tuned toms, open hi-hats, monotone bass—for 11 minutes of continuous shuddering that sounds a lot like the echo chamber of contemporary media. The final track, and the one with the most inscrutable title (""All the alts I'mm holding are hurting.""), offers more than 15 minutes of minor-key meandering and desultory drum workout; the last two minutes are just one-handed keyboard noodling, as if the artist were lost in a dream, unable, or unwilling, to decide what to do about that blue ribbon in the sky, and unwittingly become one with it. </p>
<p>For all the album's studiously generic sounds, there's nothing else that sounds quite like this, and perhaps that's the most important contradiction of all. For all his clinical reserve and careful attention to detail—some of these beats might as well contain footnotes—Barnt has ended up crafting an unusually heartfelt testament to techno's emotive potential.</p></div>"|19841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19841-barnt-magazine-13/|7.7|Philip Sherburne

For much of the last decade, the Manchester producer shifted restlessly between varied electronic niches. He darted from spartan techno to luxuriating dub and so on, releasing singles with the enthusiasm of a keen listener trying to stake his own artistic identity. In 2011, he claimed that place with unapologetic if muted audacity, issuing two immersive EPs within four months. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/""><i>Passed Me By </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/""><i>We Stay Together</i></a> flooded his self-made world of gray sounds and surface static with beats that, in retrospect, he seemed to have spent years learning and bending to his will. The deep house thuds of ""Cherry Eye"", the footwork splendor of ""North to South"", the slow-motion stutters of ""Execution"": They all cohabitated within Stott’s new twilit mode.</p>
<p>The addition of Alison Skidmore’s clarion vocals and Stott’s evermore-aggressive rhythms only enhanced the ghostly environment of the masterful 2012 LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/""><i>Luxury Problems</i></a>. Mixing field recordings, vocal takes, and an assortment of technical processes, Stott operated both inside an uncanny valley and within its inverse, making the artificial seem natural and the alien seem familiar. After more than a dozen releases, Stott could now call an approach—a liminal state of the human and inhuman, of the driving and the drifting—his own.</p>
<p>On <i>Faith in Strangers</i>, Stott’s first <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/modernlove/andy-stott-batillus-concrete"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">substantive</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19147-millie-andrea-drop-the-vowels/"" target=""_blank"">solo</a> release since <i>Luxury Problems</i>, he applies that kilned aesthetic to an expanding set of sounds and ideas. If that 2011–2012 trilogy found Stott codifying his style, <i>Faith in Strangers</i> is his attempt to stretch it by piggybacking that recent system onto his early adventurousness. It’s a bold move, one made with a new vote of public valediction. <i>Luxury Problems</i>, for instance, began with its most instant hook. Her voice wrapped in a lacework of effects, Skidmore seductively repeated ""touch"" until Stott’s shuddering beat fell in behind her. But <i>Faith in Strangers</i> starts with something that belongs more on the <a href=""http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to67_philip_jeck_sand.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">landmark sound-art label Touch.</a> ""Time Away"" opens in silence, or at least the room tone of a field recording. A horn slowly intones one note, which decays against a bed of quiet and creepy field recordings. It’s as though Stott’s world breathed in the long-tone pieces of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9082-imagined-communities/4/"" target=""_blank"">minimalist composer Yoshi Wada</a> and exhaled them through his trademark filter of glitches, pops, and hazes.</p>
<p>Skidmore’s voice arrives for the second track, the stunning ""Violence"", but it’s reversed and filtered, pieces of her syllables simply cut off at the root. ""Clap your hands/ clap your hands,"" she sings as though to tease an audience about a beat that, nearly nine minutes into the album, has yet to arrive. When at last it does, the pulse is one of the most forceful of Stott’s catalogue, the shuddering bass and snare snaps suggesting that the producer has now welcomed trap into his vocabulary, too. But it’s damaged and distorted in much the same way as all Stott sounds. He pulls new influences into his fold without allowing them to push him outside of his preordained spheres—a nightclub built with pillows and wired with headphones, or a narcotics den affixed with mirror balls and strobe lights.</p>
<p><i>Faith in Strangers </i>starts soft and light, only to have Stott gradually amplify the energy across its 54 minutes. By the time the record enters its second half, it’s climbed from half-graceful, half-spectral footwork to minimal rhythms rattled by enormous bass and lurid synths. And then, on ""No Surrender"", an organ run that suggests the house music at Timothy Leary’s Daheim Castle introduces a catastrophic beat. The kick pounds and snares pop through a sheet of static, moving as if they’ve ruptured every speaker system upon initial impact. Stott applies that distortion to the splintered IDM of ""How It Was"" and, most tellingly, to the remarkable ""Damage"".</p>
<p>The meat of that aptly named number is an enormous, bass-backed melody, the exact sort of chirping hulk that turned <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16854-tnght-ep/""><i>TNGHT</i></a> into <a href=""http://warp.net/records/tnght"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a set of five adrenaline injections</a>. For Stott, though, it’s just another plaything, an element to drag into his mix. He lets the hook blow out until it’s degraded into low fidelity, and he surrounds it on all sides with caustic noise. The harsh cymbal splashes at the start recall <a href=""http://www.max-neuhaus.info/menu.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Max Neuhaus experiment</a> with drums, the clipped ending the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAQESTUHqSQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">manic cut-ups of Hrvatski.</a> ""Damage"" is the shortest and most magnetic song on <i>Faith in Strangers</i>, Stott’s real shot at a legitimate single. But he rejects the notion wholesale, as though boasting that the rubric he’s rendered simply won’t allow something so straight.</p>
<p>In the last three years, Stott has not only cemented his approach but also upped his ambition, moving from a producer who made disjointed singles to a musician hoping to craft albums with unspoken narrative action. ""It sounds cliché to say a ‘journey,’ but it’s got to be a story in some sense,"" <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/andy-stott"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he told Tiny Mix Tapes of this LP.</a> ""It does intensify from start to finish."" At this point, actually pulling that off remains Stott’s main challenge. Despite his increasingly disciplined and unified technique, <i>Faith in Strangers</i> can feel disorganized when taken as a whole.

In both a literal and figurative sense, MacKaye’s early career was defined by restlessness, whether setting land-speed records for early '80s hardcore in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2891-minor-threat/"" target=""_blank"">Minor Threat</a> or swiftly shifting gears into the anthemic proto-emo of Embrace. But from the first notes of Joe Lally’s circular bass riff, ""Waiting Room""—the opening song on 1988’s debut self-titled EP—instantly asserted Fugazi as something markedly different than their D.C.-hardcore pedigree suggested: cooler, funkier, and, judging by the rhythmic pause slyly introduced at the 23-second mark, even a little frisky.</span></p>
<p>Actually, scratch that—as it turns out, MacKaye’s first recorded declaration as Fugazi’s frontman was ""Oh…. whoops."" As heard on this reissue of the band’s first recording session in January '88 (back when Arlington, Virginia’s fabled Inner Ear Studio could still be found in producer Don Zientara’s suburban basement), the aforementioned pause in ""Waiting Room"" not only trips up the song’s rhythm, but its lead vocalist as well. Still growing accustomed to that structural hiccup, MacKaye starts singing his first lyric before quickly realizing he came in too early, the self-described patient boy ironically thwarted by his own impatience. But the band played on and the tape kept rolling, and, despite the audible flubs and some obviously ad-libbed lyrics, Fugazi would informally distribute cassette copies of the 11-track session at their early shows, because, well, that’s what fledgling groups did with their first recordings before Bandcamp existed. And in lieu of the internet, you had <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/fugazis-first-step-toward-punk-royalty-a-demo-that-became-an-underground-smash/2014/11/13/fb2b7c9e-6540-11e4-bb14-4cfea1e742d5_story.html?tid=pm_entertainment_pop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a small but growing tape-trading cult of Fugazi fanatics</a> who wore out their hi-speed-dubbing decks to spread the word.</p>
<p>But despite Fugazi’s seeming eagerness to share these off-the-cuff efforts, a listen to <i>First Demo</i> today reveals the band’s greatest virtue in their early years was indeed their patience. It’s a quality apparent not just in the performances themselves (which see the band tempering hardcore’s incendiary energy through dub’s woozy influence, rap repartee, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Zeppelin</a>-schooled groove), but in how long it took for most of these songs to officially surface. Only three of the tracks here would be rerecorded for Fugazi’s first two EPs, four would eventually turn up in revised form on 1990’s full-length <i>Repeater</i> or its <i>3 Songs</i> supplement, while others remained buried until as late as 2002, if not scrapped altogether. But what changed in the interim wasn’t so much the sound or shape of the songs, but the very intra-band dynamic that would go onto define Fugazi’s essence.</p>
<p>At the time of <i>First Demo’</i>s recording, Guy Picciotto was still trying to elbow his way into a band that MacKaye, Lally, and drummer Brendan Canty originally envisioned as a power trio. Yet to assert himself as MacKaye’s feisty, Flavor Flav-esque foil, Picciotto’s second-vocalist duties initially amounted to punctuating MacKaye’s lines with extra emphasis rather than provide a counterpoint. You can immediately sense Picciotto’s tentative position on ""Waiting Room"", where he offers up his now-famous ""come on and get up"" post-chorus retort as a half-muttered afterthought rather than the brash call to arms we know today. And true to its title, Picciotto’s lone lead-vocal on ""Break-In"" feels very much like an intrusion, a shot of pure punk insolence that serves as a check on Fugazi’s rapidly expanding musical scope.</p>
<p>You can see why certain <i>First Demo</i> tracks didn’t make the cut on the band’s early proper releases, considering Picciotto would soon be bringing corkers like ""Give Me the Cure"" and ""Glue Man"" to the table. The embryonic take on ""Furniture"" was presumably shelved due to its rhythmic similarity to ""Waiting Room"", and it practically sounds like a preemptive dub remix of the single version that surfaced in 2001; the compilation-bound rarity ""The Word"" gets even woolier, its garage-blasted charge dissolving into a distended coda likely deemed too ponderous for release even by Fugazi’s loosening standards. Meanwhile, ""In Defense of Humans"" and ""Turn Off Your Guns"" (the one song here never released before in any form) sound like dry runs for the sort of accelerated, in-the-pocket rave-up Fugazi would perfect several years later with <i>Red Medicine</i>’s ""Bed For the Scraping"".</p>
<p>But if Fugazi was only just starting to exploit the call-and-response frisson that would ultimately spawn classics like ""Suggestion"" and ""Margin Walker"", <i>First Demo</i> nonetheless amplifies a quality so often overshadowed by the band’s ideological concerns: Fugazi are <i>fun</i>, and from day one, they’ve wielded an affirming, bounding, adrenalizing noise to which the only logical physical response is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eej-dHJadT4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hurtling yourself through a basketball hoop</a>. And if songs like ""And the Same"", ""Badmouth"", ""Song #1"", and ""Merchandise"" would appear in superior, tightened-up form on future releases, the slackened but still-potent versions here capture a band of hardcore veterans not so much stepping out of their comfort zone as finally locking into it. For long-time fans, <i>First Demo</i> makes something of a sport out of noting the minor differences between the early and official takes, like the breakdown on ""Merchandise"" where MacKaye repeats a line—""a dollar earned/ a dollar spent""—later nixed, presumably for being a bit too on-the-nose. But rather than diminish <i>First Demo</i>’s worth, such quirks ultimately justify its enduring value—these are rare, illuminating displays of imperfection from a band that, for the subsequent 15 years, made no false moves.</p></div>"|19907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19907-fugazi-first-demo/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Are you frowning?"", sings Pete Shelley on ""Keep on Believing"", one of the best tracks on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/522-buzzcocks/"">Buzzcocks</a>’ otherwise tepid ninth album <i>The Way</i>. It’s a set of questions the band has been asking their listeners—and themselves—for 38 years. Following the departure of lead singer Howard Devoto soon after the release of their 1977 debut EP, <i>Spiral Scratch</i>, guitarists Pete Shelley and Steve Diggle took over as co-frontmen; from there, Buzzcocks perfected pop-punk before it even existed as such, infusing blurred, breakneck punk anthems with doomed romanticism, anti-macho tenderness, and a flair for nerdy screeds about technology and morality. At the heart of those Buzzcocks classics, though, was the nervy balance between happy and sad. Smiling and frowning weren’t an either/or, but layers of a single gloriously conflicted expression. Which only makes <i>The Way</i> feel even flimsier by comparison.</p>
<p>Buzzcocks’ most recent album was 2006’s solid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1053-flat-pack-philosophy/""><i>Flat-Pack Philosophy</i></a>, but those intervening eight years don’t mean much in Buzzcocks-time. Shelley, Diggle, and their shifting rhythm section (now comprising Chris Remington and Danny Farrante) have taken long breaks before, starting with the band’s original dissolution in 1981. If anything, <i>The Way</i> is a chance to flaunt the fruits of their latest rejuvenation. That chance is only barely taken. The album alternates neatly between Shelley- and Diggle-sung tracks, and Shelley’s songs mostly hover in the mediocre range. ""Keep on Believing"" squanders a grabby opening and some vicious velocity by failing to summon a deep enough hook, which Buzzcocks songs live and die by. In fact, the majority of Shelley’s contributions to <i>The Way</i> seem to forget that speed, distortion, and melody don’t mean anything unless they sync up into something that sticks in the ear; ""The Way"" and ""Out of the Blue"" also come on strong then quickly evaporate, while ""It’s Not You"" and ""Virtually Real"" come closest to grasping, if weakly, what Buzzcocks once uncontestedly owned. When ""Virtually Real"" tries to take on the dehumanization of social media, it almost works—the disconnect between true love and false fronts is, after all, Buzzcocks’ wheelhouse—until Shelley’s rant against trolls becomes what it hates.</p>
<p>Diggle has always been more erratic a songwriter than Shelley, and that hasn’t changed on <i>The Way</i>. His voice is gluey and growly when matched against Shelley’s boyish, heartbroken coo, but Diggle’s compositions define both the highest and lowest points of the album. On the overwhelmingly positive side is ""Chasing Rainbows/Modern Times"", which is not only the best song on <i>The Way</i>, but the only song here worthy of being canonized into the group’s stable of classics. After a verse that puts a deft twist on the most basic pop-punk riff of all time, that of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"">Ramones</a>’ ""Blitzkrieg Bop"", Diggle’s indelible yelp carries the song through with nasal, nonsensical catchiness. ""In the Back"" is almost as good, but Diggle mars it with limp strings of clichés (""Everything’s not what it seems/ And what you give is what you get""); the turgid ""People Are Strange Machines"" doesn’t get any cleverer than its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"">Doors</a>-referencing title. His voice almost disintegrates on ""Third Dimension"", an embarrassing pastiche of 21st-century frat-garage stomp, but it’s miles better than the five plodding, go-nowhere minutes of the self-serious ""Saving Yourself"".</p>
<p>At their best, Buzzcocks can turn punk rock into a paean to bubblegum, bad love poems, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>. That bipolar exhilaration is evident on <i>The Way</i>, but it doesn’t snag as well as it could. Instead of jittery counterpoint, there’s a lax wobbliness to these songs, and that lack of interplay—both vocally and guitar-wise—is the album’s most glaring omission. Energy isn’t the problem; they just don’t know what to do with it. Every song here wants to be an anthem, and a couple almost hit the mark, but the majority are barely worthy of jingle-hood. <i>The Way</i> is the converse of what Buzzcocks fans might have come to expect from the band at this point in the game: Instead of growing soft and slick while retaining their songwriting prowess, they’ve stayed fast and raw—but left much of their popcraft somewhere behind.</p></div>"|19935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19935-buzzcocks-the-way/|5.8|Jason Heller

Wyatt had the aspect of an old man even when he was young, but for at least the last four decades he's been maintaining a consistent persona: the white-bearded great-uncle of British art-pop, smoldering with revolutionary indignation about political matters but affable and goofy on every other subject, turning up in his wheelchair when anybody happens to need his marvelous, unmistakably cracked, not-at-all-American-accented tenor on a record. It's a little alarming that he actually <i>is</i> getting older.</p>
<p><i>Different Every Time</i>, an attempt to survey Wyatt's extraordinary half-century as a steady presence at the far edges of pop, coincides with the release of Marcus O'Dair's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Different-Every-Time-Authorised-Biography/dp/1846687594"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">biography</a> of him, which shares its title; apparently, Wyatt and O'Dair were part of the group that picked the 2xCD's tracks. It's a <i>very</i> peculiar retrospective—not least because it's named after the first line of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExfewKLuoNc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sea Song""</a>, one of the most exquisite songs ever written, but doesn't actually include ""Sea Song"" (or anything else from his best album, 1974's <i>Rock Bottom</i>). His hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-FmG4JTIfk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reworking</a> of the Monkees' ""I'm a Believer"" is absent too.</p>
<p>Instead, its curious track listing is split between a disc of Wyatt-as-frontman and a disc of Wyatt-as-guest. (Even so, one of the most durable songs to have come out under his name—the Falklands-war lament ""Shipbuilding"", written for him by Elvis Costello and Clive Langer—has somehow ended up on the latter.) The first disc begins awkwardly: a 19-minute track by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8280-soft-machine/"">Soft Machine</a>, the prog-rock ensemble with whom he played drums and sang from 1966 to 1971, a couple of briefer pieces by his subsequent I'm-gonna-do-this-<i>my</i>-way band Matching Mole (an Anglicization of ""<i>machine molle</i>,"" i.e. ""soft machine""), and a song from the 1974 <i>Live at Drury Lane</i> gig that was his only stage performance as a solo headliner. The rest of it is a collection of terrific material that's less satisfying than most of the solo albums from which it's excerpted. Still, it shows how wide Wyatt's range of moods can be: sadly meditative (""Free Will and Testament""), sadly blissful (a cover of Chic's ""At Last I Am Free""), sadly jolly (""Yesterday Man""), sadly terrifying (""Beware"", sung as a duet with its writer Karen Mantler).</p>
<p>The real attraction of <i>Different Every Time</i> is its second disc, subtitled ""Benign Dictatorships"", which cherrypicks from Wyatt's scores of guest appearances on other people's records. For an artist as idiosyncratic as he is, he's an astoundingly versatile and prolific collaborator: the six-degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon figure who directly links Jimi Hendrix, Hot Chip, Swell Maps, Pink Floyd, and Björk. The track selection here mostly gravitates toward quiet and subtle work, rather than the juicy pop records on which Wyatt has occasionally sung—it's worth seeking out Ultramarine's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-t4RtqNEZs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Happy Land""</a> and Bertrand Burgalat's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGv13da2ik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Summer Night""</a>, neither of which are included here.</p>
<p>But it's sequenced for mood and continuity rather than chronology, and it flows as well as any album Wyatt's made. One section focuses on his longstanding affiliation with jazz composers Michael Mantler and Carla Bley. Another sequence features Wyatt singing a couple of marvelous revolution-for-the-working-class anthems, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piuGwyhC4HI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Turn Things Upside Down""</a> (with the brass band Happy End) and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHCSMT1Q1OY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Venceremos (We Will Win)"" </a>(a Latin-jazz groove recorded with Working Week and Tracey Thorn). There's even a pretty good song featuring O'Dair's band Grasscut, and a beautiful deep-cut choice for the closer: Wyatt's unaccompanied, ancient-sounding voice, recorded in 1976, singing ""Experiences No. 2"", a John Cage setting of an E.E. Cummings poem. If we're not going to get any more new records from the old man, this is a more than acceptable consolation prize.</p></div>"|19920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19920-different-every-time/|7.3|Douglas Wolk

And since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18117-serengeti-kenny-dennis-lp/"" target=""_blank"">Kenny Dennis</a> first bellowed his way into the world, an alter ego that first seemed like a delivery means for some oddball Chicagoland Joe-sixpack comedy has become the sort of deeply familiar character that reveals new facets each time out. Increasingly less of a pure comedy character as time goes on, the raspy, mustachioed Cool Uncle of indie rap has also turned out to be a put-upon underdog, a proud yet self-conscious working artist who's determined to shake off failure at all costs with a strident determination. In hindsight, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slIHk6QytcM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his defense of Cubs scapegoat Steve Bartman</a> feels like a strong solidarity with a guy who has to live with the weight of a ""What Could've Been?"" scenario that was actually out of his control.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Kenny Dennis III</i> is technically a few Roman numerals behind the actual size of the Dennis discography (word to <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/1917907-Tha-Grimm-Teachaz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tha Grimm Teachaz</a>). But it does make for a strong thematic trilogy with 2012 character-study <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16436-serengeti-kenny-dennis-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kenny Dennis</i> <i>EP</i></a> and last year's pathos-injected <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18117-serengeti-kenny-dennis-lp/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kenny Dennis</i> <i>LP</i></a>. Odd Nosdam returns to provide more off-kilter, goofy yet stirring production, and there's another suite of skits featuring Anders Holm from ""Workaholics"" playing Kenny's on-again/off-again estranged friend Ders. But this time, there's a stronger throughline to the concept: most of the feel to <i>Kenny Dennis III</i> hinges on what happens when Ders decides to move back to Chicago from L.A. and tries getting a hip-hop group going with Kenny. It all goes to hell pretty quickly over the course of two separate skit medleys, as Kenny's big idea to record '90s throwback freestyle house crossover as ""Perfecto"" brings out the worst in Kenny's ego and puts another wedge between himself and Ders. As off-the-wall nonsense goes, it's actually pretty affecting, a mixture of caricatured absurdity and real-folks groundedness worthy of Prince Paul.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the frustration and the anger are also a little more palpable than on <i>LP</i> and <i>EP</i>, with Ders' POV of Kenny's jerk-ass behavior on tour offset by Kenny's own diatribe-flow stories. He still liberally sprinkles in references to sports fandom, '80s muscle cars, and basic-cable action movies, but now it feels more like those points of interest double as security blankets. ""No Beginner"" plants his feet firmly on the ground in opposition to calculated trendy weirdness -- ""I'm not tryin to kill turtles or dye my hair strange colors/ I'm just tryin' to do rap songs and be down with my brothers""—but a daily diet of ""hot dog for lunch/ hot dog for dinner/ don't eat breakfast/ I am no beginner"" isn't exactly the glamorous life. He gets into chest-puffing brawls in ""Shidoshi"" over people mad about how he's ""makin' it look good,"" attempting to pull Dim Mak death punches on fools. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt6tpnyzcWU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>The video for this track</span></a>, meanwhile, involves a failed intervention.) On ""Buddy Guy"", the <a href=""http://www.chessrecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chess Records</a> legend's name becomes a taunting way of addressing a hopped-up adversary who might just be himself. And ""Tanya T"" is the flashpoint where things implode, as Kenny helps bail out his little brother—a victim of domestic violence—and puts a (garage) roof over his head, only to see him become a police informant. When the track ends with Kenny screaming ""and this the thanks I get?!"" over and over, any impressions of <i>Kenny Dennis III</i> as ""comedy rap"" dissipate pretty quickly, and it's hard not to feel for a guy once easily thought of as a funny voice and funnier mustache.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Serengeti inhabits the Kenny Dennis world so thoroughly that the affectations and tics have become a style to actually contend with, raspy muttering and roaring bellows concealing vivid free-association worldbuilding and playing with the joys of repetition. The characteristic Odd Nosdam production toes that line between awkward, whimsical discomfort and melancholy, muddy stoner soul, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5277-black-moth-super-rainbow/"">Black Moth Super Rainbow</a> midpoint that flips from amusing to unnerving without you even noticing. And in the end, all the blue-collar detritus and supposed punchlines give a stark portrait of a man who invokes his '90s glory days like a shield against their loss, making a clear point of the coping-mechanism properties of his nostalgia without either reveling in it or mocking it. ""Sometimes I watch <i>The Negotiator </i>and think about life's long times,"" he admits in the midst of the downcast, reflective closer ""Tickled Pink"", a search for perspective and meaning in a life that might not have turned out the way he wanted it to.</p></div>"|19941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19941-serengeti-kenny-dennis-iii/|7.9|Nate Patrin

His songs weren't especially complex, but they hit their marks and made an impact. His crazed performances were undeniable. Sure, the recording quality was pretty crummy, but you could say the same of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31293-the-oblivians/"">Oblivians</a>' and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29598-the-reatards/"">Reatards</a>' early records (and Segall's demos stand up alongside <i>Soul Food </i>and <i>Teenage Hate</i>). It was easy to root for him on those early outings—the fresh-faced punk screamer unleashing his inner demon and making songs promising enough to make you wonder where he'd go next.</p>
<p>His trajectory from there—following <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14347-melted/""><i>Melted</i></a> in 2010—isn't as easily summarized. After signing to <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a>, he generally moved in a singer/songwriter direction, but still kept releasing one-off rippers on labels like <a href=""http://www.castlefacerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Castle Face</a>, <a href=""http://www.goner-records.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goner</a>, and <a href=""http://permanentrecordschicago.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Permanent</a>. And now, his prodigious output is what he's best known for: Segall has released a <i>lot</i> of music, heaps of stuff, to the point where it's hard to keep track of it all, and he's refused to conform to a single style or aesthetic. Sometimes, he'll sing in a detached croon (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBtClHtyDZ8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fine""</a>) and trigger full-on folk nostalgia with his acoustic rambles (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX6FiGZURSs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gold on the Shore""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj0Jf2kJyk0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The West""</a>). Elsewhere, he transforms into Mr. Hyde for blasts of vicious, blistering rock'n'roll (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/""><i>Slaughterhouse</i></a>). So when presented with a compilation of singles from his past four years, the first question is which version of Segall will get top billing: the lizard-brained Kiss/Black Sabbath apostle or the sentimental balladeer.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <i>$INGLE$ 2</i>'s 12 songs avoid pigeonholing. Segall brings the fuzz and fury, but the aggression is cut with tracks like ""Falling Hair"" and ""Children of Paul"", the plaintive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/""><i>Goodbye Bread</i></a> era B-sides. If his previous singles compilation showed an artist asserting his garage punk dominance, this is the teenaged wrecker all grown up and ready to prove that he's capable of much more.</p>
<p>For a collection of odds and ends, <i>$INGLE$ 2</i> works remarkably well as an <i>album</i>. To my ear, it's sequenced better than <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17133-twins/"">Twins</a> </i>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19668-ty-segall-manipulator/""><i>Manipulator</i></a>, which makes some sense: the tracks are presented in chronological order, which makes for a natural narrative, each of his short-lived modes transitioning into his next. It also helps that there's no filler to speak of—any A-sides already found on Drag City albums have been omitted in favor of B-sides and rarities. The only track that previously appeared on an album is ""Hand Glams"", but the single version is another beast entirely, and, with the addition of vocal harmonies and a psychedelic warble, a far more interesting one at that.</p>
<p>It's almost hard to believe that Segall's scraps are this strong—take ""For Those Who Weep"", a <i>Twins</i> era B-side that ranks as one of the best songs he's written. It was a sign of things to come from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18398-ty-segall-sleeper/""><i>Sleeper</i></a>—warm acoustic material that sounds classic, the sort of thing you could have seen the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">Byrds</a> covering. On the other end of the spectrum, Segall delivers ""Fucked Up Motherfucker"", which, with its vicious churn and Steve Mackay-style sax, deserves a place in the spotlight instead of getting lost in the shuffle as one-twelfth of Castle Face's <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Various-Group-Flex-II-Son-Of-Flex/release/4163985"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Group Flex II </i>book</a>. Segall even breaks the trend of covers that feel like hollow throwaways. (The low point of <i>Slaughterhouse </i>was the Segall Band's version of ""Diddy Wah Diddy"".) His ramped up version of the Velvet Underground and Nico's ""Femme Fatale"" excels in this comp's context, as does his stomping rendition of the Groundhogs' ""Cherry Red"". The album ends on a high note with ""Pettin the Dog"", a predictably vicious GG Allin cover (made G-rated for WFMU, with a more radio-friendly title).</p>
<p>Segall's most recent album, <i>Manipulator</i>, was at times a frustrating listen. It was quite good on a song for song basis, but it often felt safe, and Segall's mix of thrilling and somber was muddied. All of which explains why this compilation is so welcome. In addition to rounding up odds and ends, it's an important LP in its own right. Don't be fooled by how tacky the two dollar signs look in that album title: <i>$INGLE$ 2 </i>is the best Ty Segall album that got released in 2014.</p></div>"|20020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20020-ty-segall-ingle-2/|7.9|Evan Minsker

Every curator knows that, and David Bowie is nothing if not a curator. The first great Bowie best-of was 1976's <i>Changesonebowie</i> LP, whose argument was that he was a mamapapa comin' for you, a rocker too strong and too glittery to be pinned down. (The 1981 <i>Changestwobowie</i> LP and the 1990 <i>Changesbowie</i> CD, stabbed in its gut by the dreadful remix ""Fame '90"", tried to extend that premise.) Bowie's initial attempt at a full-career assessment was the 1989 <i>Sound + Vision</i> box set, revised and updated in 2003. In both forms, it's a bunch of hits and album tracks and rarities clumped together, an impressive show of range whose failure is that it assumes, rather than argues, that he's a rock god and that therefore anything he does is interesting.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years later, coinciding with an actual <a href=""http://www2.mcachicago.org/exhibition/david-bowie-is/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">touring museum exhibition</a> of the apparatus around his music, Bowie has assembled a new retrospective. <i>Nothing Has Changed</i>—a very sly title, as a riposte to <i>Changesonebowie</i> and ""Changes"", especially since it's also a lyric lifted from his 2002 song ""Sunday""—comes in three different versions, each with a cover image of Bowie regarding himself in a mirror. That's a sharp gesture too: he's never been shy about his fascination with his own mercurial self, shedding his skin again and again and then carefully preserving it to wriggle into again later. (This is not the first time he's done the ""multiple versions of a greatest-hits set"" trick, either: 2002's <i>Best of Bowie</i> had twenty different track lineups, depending on which country you bought it in.)</p>
<p>The weakest of the three versions of <i>Nothing Has Changed</i> is the chronologically sequenced 2xCD version. It's basically just a slight revision of <i>Best of Bowie</i>, compressed to throw in five later songs including the newly recorded oddity ""Sue (or In a Season of Crime)"". The first disc starts with his commercial breakthrough ""Space Oddity"" and ends with its sequel/repudiation ""Ashes to Ashes"", which is a nice bit of symmetry. Mostly, what we get is Bowie as he's understood by oldies radio, although we're seven tracks in before he really starts to toughen up (with ""Ziggy Stardust"").</p>
<p>But the second half of the 2xCD version covers three times as many years as the first, and suggests that Bowie was a temporarily interesting trend-follower whose fade-out has been slowed by his being repeatedly propped up and dragged into modernity by big-name collaborators: Queen, Pat Metheny, Pet Shop Boys, Trent Reznor, James Murphy. This Bowie's sense of tune eventually abandons him and never returns. After the look back in sorrow of ""Absolute Beginners"", halfway through the second disc, he's coasting on his rep; it's just one decent comeback attempt after another, with ""Sue"" at the end as a sort of I-give-up-but-here's-something-new-anyway gesture. That's a reasonable case to make; it also misses most of what's magical about this particular artist.</p>
<p>The 2xLP version of <i>Nothing Has Changed</i> makes a simpler and happier argument, that this is a dude with a lot of big hits and a peculiar arty streak. It's a non-chronological set, mostly songs that you might want to play if you were DJing a party—three out of 20 are the singles from <i>Let's Dance</i>. The sides have something like thematic unity: Bowie the dancefloor-filler and lighter-waver, Ziggy/Aladdin the glam spaceman, David the magisterial vocalist and pop experimentalist (this is where ""Sue"" lands), and You-Know-Who the introspective <i>eminence grise </i>(concluding with last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14734-where-are-we-now/"">""Where Are We Now?""</a>). You could do worse.</p>
<p>The 3xCD <i>Nothing Has Changed</i>, though, is the jewel among the three variations on the same core material. Its masterstroke is that its 59 tracks appear in <i>reverse</i> chronological order. To end a greatest-hits with ""Sue"" is to remind listeners that there's a good moment to hit the stop button. To <i>begin</i> it with ""Sue""—the longest track on the whole thing—smacks us to attention. This is Bowie as he wants us to encounter him, as a practitioner of fine art whose interests have occasionally, improbably, marvelously intersected with pop of the moment. ""Sue"", written and recorded with Maria Schneider and her jazz orchestra, announces its intentions from the moment Bowie's actorly baritone warbles in: it's the latest in his line of homages to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a>, the double whose guise is the one role he's never been able to play. (The artistic relationship between Bowie and Walker—so similar, so different—is a complicated topic on its own; the comprehensive Bowie blog Pushing Ahead of the Dame includes a pair of <a href=""https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/nite-flights/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brilliant</a> <a href=""https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/the-motel/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">posts</a> about it.)</p>
<p>For at least the rest of its first disc, the 3xCD version reframes latter-day Bowie as an alternate-universe version of Walker, a solemn avant-gardist who keeps trying to rocket out beyond pop and keeps being drawn back into its gravity well. That makes his later work a <i>lot</i> more interesting, it turns out. This is a Bowie who never runs out of fresh ways to gaze back at himself in the mirror. There are three tracks here from his never-released 2001 album <i>Toy</i>: reworked versions of a pair of songs from his youth, and the lovely obscurity ""Your Turn to Drive"", which is as close as he's ever come to dreampop. And it's hard to miss the science fiction that's never totally left his lyrics when James Murphy's remix of ""Love Is Lost"" (with its quotation from ""Ashes to Ashes"") appears next to ""The Stars (Are Out Tonight)"" and ""New Killer Star"", and just down the hall from Pet Shop Boys' reworking of ""Hallo Spaceboy"" (which itself incorporates a William S. Burroughs-style cut-up of lines from ""Space Oddity"").</p>
<p>The edited and remixed versions of Bowie's post-1995 singles that populate the first disc are all distinct improvements on their original versions; you'd be forgiven for wondering if 1999's dismal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/881-hours/""><i>Hours...</i></a> was as good as it seems here. Single mixes are the meat of the rest of <i>Nothing Has Changed</i> too, because the metric for inclusion even on the longest version is, more or less, which songs were some kind of hit. (Although it's worth noting that a collection of Bowie's U.S. Top 40 singles would be 10 songs long and end with 1987's ""Day-In Day-Out"" and ""Never Let Me Down"", neither of which appear here. We do get ""The Man Who Sold the World""—which was never a single and didn't appear on a major Bowie compilation until 1997—and ""All the Young Dudes"", a hit for Mott the Hoople whose studio recording Bowie didn't even release until the mid-90s.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there's some curation going on here. <i>Nothing Has Changed</i> is a version of Bowie's career in which his circa-1990 hard rock quartet Tin Machine never happened (that's just fine, actually). Cultural currency and UK chart success are no guarantee of inclusion: there's no ""D.J."", no ""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)"", no ""Suffragette City"", no ""John, I'm Only Dancing"", no ""Queen Bitch"", and don't even ask about ""The Laughing Gnome"". Undignified moments like the <i>Labyrinth</i> soundtrack and ""Real Cool World"" have been expunged from this particular record (although somehow ""Dancing in the Street"" wasn't—the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_li_d_YviZ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">musicless version</a> of that one is preferable.). The ""Berlin trilogy"" of albums is represented by one quick blast apiece (""Boys Keep Swinging"" into ""'Heroes'"" into ""Sound and Vision"", shoulder to shoulder in glory). But its swift, forceful backward flow through Bowie's waves of reinvention and discovery is worth more than any kind of completeness would be.</p>
<p>What the 3xCD museum tour of <i>Nothing</i> offers instead is a treat in its final chamber. It keeps on zooming past ""Space Oddity"" to Bowie's juvenilia, the five years' worth of grasps at the brass ring that preceded Major Tom's rocket to the stars. (<i>David Bowie Is</i>, the actual museum show, also includes his youthful presentiments of what would come later.) Here, again, the reverse chronology works marvelously. ""Silly Boy Blue"" anticipates the voice we've been hearing all the way from ""Sue"" on back; ""Liza Jane"" (the recorded debut of ""Davie Jones"") and ""You've Got a Habit of Leaving"" are the work of a teenager learning to play a more complicated version of dress-up. And ""Can't Help Thinking About Me"", the first single for which he tried on the David Bowie name, becomes a key to the whole exhibition: a beautiful young Narcissus, shedding his identity for the first time, and already looking back on what he's left behind himself.</p></div>"|20004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20004-david-bowie-nothing-has-changed/|8.8|Douglas Wolk

Cultural currency and UK chart success are no guarantee of inclusion: there's no ""D.J."", no ""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)"", no ""Suffragette City"", no ""John, I'm Only Dancing"", no ""Queen Bitch"", and don't even ask about ""The Laughing Gnome"". Undignified moments like the <i>Labyrinth</i> soundtrack and ""Real Cool World"" have been expunged from this particular record (although somehow ""Dancing in the Street"" wasn't—the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_li_d_YviZ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">musicless version</a> of that one is preferable.). The ""Berlin trilogy"" of albums is represented by one quick blast apiece (""Boys Keep Swinging"" into ""'Heroes'"" into ""Sound and Vision"", shoulder to shoulder in glory). But its swift, forceful backward flow through Bowie's waves of reinvention and discovery is worth more than any kind of completeness would be.</p>
<p>What the 3xCD museum tour of <i>Nothing</i> offers instead is a treat in its final chamber. It keeps on zooming past ""Space Oddity"" to Bowie's juvenilia, the five years' worth of grasps at the brass ring that preceded Major Tom's rocket to the stars. (<i>David Bowie Is</i>, the actual museum show, also includes his youthful presentiments of what would come later.) Here, again, the reverse chronology works marvelously. ""Silly Boy Blue"" anticipates the voice we've been hearing all the way from ""Sue"" on back; ""Liza Jane"" (the recorded debut of ""Davie Jones"") and ""You've Got a Habit of Leaving"" are the work of a teenager learning to play a more complicated version of dress-up. And ""Can't Help Thinking About Me"", the first single for which he tried on the David Bowie name, becomes a key to the whole exhibition: a beautiful young Narcissus, shedding his identity for the first time, and already looking back on what he's left behind himself.</p></div>"|20004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20004-david-bowie-nothing-has-changed/|6.5|Douglas Wolk

Their remedy for distraction was disruption—that is, to make a spine-jolting, whiplashing, smartphone-shattering noise that couldn’t be ignored, coupled with uniformly stern appearances and a striking lead singer, Jehnny Beth, who can seem like she’s peering into your soul and draining you of your secrets even when she’s glancing in another direction. Savages assert an ironically severe, almost militaristic aesthetic for a band who says its primary objective is to promote ""</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/savages/"">emancipation</a>""<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> from cultural conformity and institutionalized oppression. But you can’t accuse them of not heeding their own advice: mere weeks after </span><i>Silence Yourself </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">hit record-store shelves, Savages were already eager to upset the expectations of anyone who had them pegged as that month’s post-punk pin-ups.</span></p>
<p><i>Words to the Blind</i> is the name of a 37-minute, Dada-inspired concert staged at the Red Gallery in London, UK on May 29, 2013 in collaboration with locally based Japanese psych-punk outfit Bo Ningen. Or, rather, in confrontation: As Beth explained to me in <a href=""http://www.thegridto.com/culture/music/unknown-pleasures/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> last year, ""At Cabaret Voltaire [in Zurich], they would do simultaneous poetry—poems in different languages recited at the same time. We started from that idea and did this sonic poem with two bands playing a piece together simultaneously, [like] a battle."" To emphasize that aspect, the two bands were arranged symmetrically in a U-formation, so that their respective players were facing off against one another. But while the notion of two groups engaging in lawless sonic warfare—and listeners’ attention being divided between two oppositional entities—may run counter to Savages’ core philosophy of drowning out extraneous noise and sharpening our mental focus, this live document of the event ultimately serves the same ideal (albeit through a more meticulous, protracted, and sometimes punishing process).</p>
<p>The phrase ""words to the blind"" first appeared as a lyric in <i>Silence Yourself</i>’s caustic opener ""Shut Up"", and thus serves as a sort of hyperlink from Savages’ ideologically driven art-punk attack into the sensory, improvised mode of communication at play in this piece. Likewise, the performance requires Bo Ningen to melt down their intricately constructed, hyperactive contorto-rock—the technicolor yin to Savages’ grayscale yang—into more mercurial form. True to the project’s original Dadaist-poetry inspiration, <i>Words to the Blind</i> begins with Beth and Bo Ningen’s Taigen Kawabe ominously whispering random phrases in French and Japanese, respectively, as if reciting an ancient spell to awaken their sleeping-beast instrumentalists. Over the course of the next 10 minutes, the recording stirs to life in a slowly mounting atmospheric swirl of eerie guitar squeals, rain-on-tin drum patter, random bass blurts, and frosty-breathed coos, before the two groups find a common ground on a stalking rhythm that eventually yields to a series of seismic, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"">Boredoms</a>-worthy psych-metal eruptions at the halfway point.</p>
<p>But while those sudden volcanic outbursts provide ample payoff for <i>Words to the Blind</i>’s distended build-up, and serve as the piece’s structural peak, its true climax is revealed in the ashen aftermath. As Beth assumes lead vocals in English, the final third unsurprisingly constitutes the most distinctly Savages-like passage, with a corrosive groove gutted from the same sludgy turf as <i>Silence Yourself</i>’s ""Strife"". But in this context, Beth’s familiar references to fraught eroticism (""you are jealous,"" ""I betray you,"" ""We are friends, we are enemies, speaking our love songs in different languages"") speak as much to the tension that inevitably exists between two bands engaging in a musical experiment of this magnitude. In <i>Words to the Blind</i>’s deceptively peaceful dying moments, Beth repeats the phrase ""The skin divides the broken hearts/ The love divides the lovers/ The beautiful song of the night/ Is a song of war""—before the two bands unleash one final round of cacophonous crossfire, like <a href=""http://youtu.be/1c0FN8ajIlY?t=1m56s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a gangland shootout from which no one walks away alive</a>. For Savages and Bo Ningen, harmony is ultimately found in anarchy.</p></div>"|19949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19949-savages-bo-ningen-words-to-the-blind/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Most of these are ripped from the song’s titles: ""insect eyes,"" ""decadence,"" ""reactor,"" ""strange rage,"" ""static,"" ""psychic talk show."" They’re used as bludgeons, shouted by multiple voices, often lobbed with disdain or disgust. Obviously, there’s a lot of punk rock utility in catchy, abrasive, oft-repeated two-word hooks—when several people shout ""black mold"" in unison, you pay attention. With these kinds of choruses, they come out of the gate with undeniable power, but Nots aren’t merely offering a surface-level veneer of ""creepy"" or ""strange."" Natalie Hoffmann, Charlotte Watson, Madison Farmer, and Alexandra Eastburn are, at times, incredibly bleak. They’re letting you know that they’ve lived through some shit.</p>
<p>Here are some of their points of reference: a person stumbling in the dark while consumed by rage, joyless posturing, blank smiles, blood on the lawn, decay—the names, faces, stories, details, and circumstances behind their songs are unclear, veiled behind minimal poetry and symbolism. That's why every song encourages a few deep listens with the lyrics sheet in hand—there are so many subtle turns in their words, and when you look closely at their stark phrasings, it's clear they communicate quite a bit.</p>
<p>Regardless of where it's coming from, <i>We Are Nots</i> is fueled by its deep well of anger and frustration. Listen to how they yell; they're sick of being complacent, of watching people walk around with an unwarranted smug ease. Nots don't have time for that, and their brand of ""weird punk,"" as Hoffmann summarized it during a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnh8a11_JoA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Memphis morning TV segment</a>, lends an ominous attack which reflects that tone. Every member of the band plays a role in adding heft and urgency to complement the lyrics. There's Farmer's persistently ominous bass, Hoffmann's swirling and echoing hellscape guitars, Watson's unrelenting bash, and perhaps the most imperative weapon in Nots' arsenal, Eastburn's ever-present synthesizer. So often, synths in punk music are an afterthought with a definitively tertiary spot behind the guitars. Here, it plays a prominent role in forming each track's overall tone.</p>
<p>Eastburn's presence also gives the band more freedom to go long. The Memphis band’s debut 7” arrived late last year—four muffled, lo-fi tracks that were vicious and raucous. Under their initial lineup (Hoffmann, Watson, and Laurel Ferdon), they delivered great songs. Still, they <i>felt</i> definitively like 7” songs—succinct, loud, and powerful, but too primitive and punchy to carry an entire album. Like so many other bands in the garage punk sphere just putting out their first single, it was unclear whether or not they could transition naturally into an ""album band."" They did, though—<i>We Are Nots</i> succeeds because Nots have evolved. With Watson moving behind the drums, they’ve got a stronger backbone. Eastburn’s synthesizers expand the band's scope, making their songs feel more fully realized and giving the band more freedom to go long. On “Reactor”, for example, Hoffmann takes her time with a few well-placed guitar stabs; she wouldn’t be able to do that without the band’s newfound synth sprawl.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle they face with their first long-player is that <i>We Are Nots</i> is clearly set in its ways. The synthesizers, the gang vocals, their approach to choruses—it's all reasonably similar across these 27 minutes. Even Hoffmann’s vocal style, thrillingly furious in its from-the-gut delivery, doesn’t vary too much. But the structures, stories, and overall tones differ enough from song to song that this never feels like a monotone slog. They've created a surefooted, aesthetic defining opening statement.</p>
<p>""Don’t act like you and I would get along,"" sings Hoffmann on the 48-second track ""Get Along"" shortly before she’s joined by several voices feverishly yawping ""LA LA LA LA LA LA LA"" over and over again. Hoffmann might be alone in pointing the finger accusingly during the verse, but she's quickly backed by her bandmates. They're a united front, belligerent and dizzying in their approach. It's aggressive, and it sounds like fun.</p></div>"|19966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19966-nots-we-are-nots/|7.8|Evan Minsker

One song over, drummer Casey Weissbuch's locked himself in the bathroom, where he's enjoying a few minutes to himself in full view of the mirror. On name alone, it's hard to say just how seriously a person should be taking a band like Diarrhea Planet; and even harder, when they're spitting comically awful game, touting the well-documented virtues of self-love, or trying to cram four guitar solos into two-and-a-half minutes. Still, listening to <i>Aliens in the Outfield</i>, you get the distinct impression that, if nobody else is going to take Diarrhea Planet seriously, they may just have to take up the task themselves. Fear not, DP loyal: the five-song <i>Aliens</i> contains no shortage of boot-and-rally solos, nor opportunities for downing freshly keyed beers. But once you cut through the tangled fretwork and all those gang choruses, there's a quiet ambition at work here, which finds Diarrhea Planet stretching out song lengths and dipping into a darker mood or two.</p>
<p>Recorded with Justin Francis (Anti-Flag, Kenny Rogers), <i>Aliens</i> is Diarrhea Planet's first release since 2013's sophomore LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18410-diarrhea-planet-im-rich-beyond-your-wildest-dreams/""><i>I'm Rich Beyond Your Wildest Dreams</i></a>. Francis helps DP maintain a bit more control over the inevitable chaos that arises when you've got four guitars, three singers, and—in Weissbuch—a drummer with roughly seven arms. Not that <i>Aliens</i> is an especially polished recording; tempos still fly forward, and vocals still take a note or two to find their pitch. But, with a little more separation between all those moving parts, DP's frequently squashed studio sound is getting closer to approaching the sweat-spattered energy of their can't-miss live shows.</p>
<p>Chorus-dodging opener ""Heat Wave"" is a blur, barreling through a couple Jordan Smith verses, a bridge-to-nowhere from the sweet-voiced Emmett Miller, and at least one barnburning solo. ""Heat Wave"" feels a bit grafted together by spare parts, getting by purely on forward motion; Smith's slippery verse melody and Miller's starry-eyed interlude are no match for the solo jammed between them, and the general apathy at the heart of the lyrics (""I don't give a shit/ And I know that you don't care"") don't exactly help the song linger long past the fadeout. Highlight ""Platinum Girls"" sets Toler's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsdy_rct6uo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Two Princes""</a> routine up with a lively little melody or three; atop a melody this blithely catchy, a line like the eternally eager Toler's ""though I could never be your nice guy/ I'd proudly be your 20-times-a-night guy"" manages, in its fumbling sort of way, to endear.</p>
<p>""Bamboo Curtain"" doesn't limit its self-examination to matters of the flesh; Weissbuch's stolen moment finds him ""washing away all [his] crazy shit that [he] can't deal with"" alongside wads of used Kleenex. While the song's slantwards melody and flickers of neon guitar recall <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>'s <i>Pinkerton</i>-era lonerism, live staple ""Spooners"" goes for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"">Japandroids</a>-style communal catharsis: ""it's all about the drugs, money, power, and getting off,"" Smith yells, adding ""and getting fucked up when you can't get your point across."" Between the extended intro, the false ending, and the wordless chorus, the restless ""Spooners"" seems too busy getting from one place to another to actually settle into the business of being a song for more than a few seconds at a time. So it goes with closer ""Peg Daddy"", which rides a lengthy post-rock buildup into a yearning chorus; the anticipation's nice, but the song it eventually settles on is your standard-issue existential drama, hinging awkwardly on a slapdash metaphor full of crashing waves and mental prisons.</p>
<p>The uptick in ambition all these take-offs and landings inject into DP's music is certainly admirable, but the execution's not always so dazzling; every one of these songs would do well to push the chorus further forward, not to delay the inevitable by throwing another twinkling guitar on the pile. And between the rough-around-the-edges presentation and the ripcord song structures, there's a certain unfixed quality to these five tracks; you get the feeling, listening to <i>Aliens in the Outfield</i>, that these tunes—spirited, albeit spotty—still haven't quite come to full fruition, that they'll be at their best on some Tuesday night in Omaha, not here as presented on record. And, for whatever it's worth, the more serious notes they've attempted to fold into these songs simply can't match the easy charms of an old chestnut like ""Ghost With a Boner"". But the real issue with <i>Aliens in the Outfield</i> isn't so much unrealized ambitions or misguided stabs at something like maturity. As with every other DP record before it, it's this: it'll do in a pinch, but up against that beastly live show, the play-at-home version's just no match for the real thing.</p></div>"|19982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19982-diarrhea-planet-aliens-in-the-outfield-ep/|6.2|Paul Thompson

""You already know the story, the chords are just the same,"" he sings, accompanied by strums and warbling cassette ambience. ""You already know I love you, now I sound like what's-his-name.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">When he recorded the demo of ""Someone Else’s Song"", Tweedy was entering a scary new phase of his musical—and personal—life after the dissolution of alt-country heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4416-uncle-tupelo/"">Uncle Tupelo</a>, in which he mostly played second fiddle to fellow frontman Jay Farrar. And in 1995, the same year the demo was originally released, the then-28-year-old became a new husband and father, with little name recognition and no discernible life skills other than writing and singing songs. But even on that imperfect artifact, a lot of what would later define Tweedy as an artist was apparent: the casualness, the anxiety, the almost-uncomfortable sincerity. Meanwhile, the randomness of the recorded-over cassette’s pops and hisses could be heard as an accidental precursor to the unplanned abstractions that would later elevate Wilco to the realm of America’s most innovative rock bands. So just as the early take on ""Someone Else’s Song"" catches a vulnerable songwriter at an especially vulnerable moment, its overall message is resolute, with Tweedy spinning his referential concerns into confidence: ""You can't stop me, I want you to know/ I know it sounds like someone else's song, from a long time ago.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Both <i>Alpha Mike Foxtrot</i> and the 38-song <i>What’s Your 20?</i> best-of compilation offer compelling timelines of Wilco’s unlikely evolution from somewhat-generic roots rockers, to quasi-pop studio mad men, to soothsaying rock’n’roll deconstructionists, to spasmodic guitar adventurers, to epiphanic jammers, to a comfortable, if less exciting, combination of all those previous guises. <i>What’s Your 20? </i>is for the neophytes—it’s a very reasonable place to start for future generations facing down Wilco’s full catalog on Spotify. <i>Alpha </i>is for the die-hards, the ones who may have a yellowing ticket stub from the band’s fall 2001 tour in a drawer somewhere, who know all the words without thinking, who want to live through this band once again, but in a skewed, newish way.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Every track isn’t some kind of lost classic, and not just because every track has already been released in some form, whether as a B-side, on a soundtrack, or via the band’s website. Even Tweedy himself acknowledges some of the lesser moments here with off-the-cuff, generally-on-point track-by-track liner notes: He describes a scattershot remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8677-summer-teeth/""><i>Summerteeth</i></a>’s ""A Shot in the Arm"" by David Kahne (aka the guy who rejected <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8676-yankee-hotel-foxtrot/""><i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i></a> and dropped Wilco from Reprise Records) as ""a dated mess [that] doesn’t have anything to do with the feeling that I had about the song,"" and confesses that the horny, cringe-worthy ""Old Maid"" is drummer ""Glenn Kotche’s least favorite song in the entire Wilco oeuvre."" Running nearly five hours, <i>Alpha</i> plays like a clearinghouse more than a finely-edited set but, largely thanks to its bevy of well-chosen live tracks, its sidelong view of Wilco is worth a peek.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Though Tweedy first gained attention as an acolyte of classic country and folk, it’s his penchant for upending convention that has proven to be most enduring. This restlessness was there from the beginning; though Uncle Tupelo were known for their reverence to songwriting tradition, they also weren’t afraid to bust out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1silCo8FKI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a blitzing punk version of ""Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door""</a>—or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWn5B1FE3fU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a country take on the Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a>. <i>Alpha </i>highlights this rip-‘em-up aesthetic early on with two versions of the small-town ode ""Passenger Side"", from Wilco’s 1995 debut, <i>A.M.</i>; the first jangles and twangs tastefully while the second turns the song into a pop-punk screecher in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"">Replacements</a> mold.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This contrarian strategy—taking a quiet song and exploding it live, or vice versa—offered a way for Wilco to make their early songs, along with the band itself, more slippery and less susceptible to pigeonholing. Another great example of this from <i>Alpha</i> is an aching guitar-and-piano take on <i>A.M.</i>’s ""Box of Letters"", which reveals the hurt underneath the kiss-off’s biting album version while reminding us of the warmth of Tweedy’s determined shrug of a voice. Eventually, the band figured out how to combine its multiple musical personalities within one song as Tweedy delved further into himself to tease-out a fresh kind of indirect writing based on improvisation and subconscious connection.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""For a long time, I thought if I wrote a song that anybody could sing, I'd succeeded,"" he told <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/wilco-are-we-out-of-the-woods-yet/Content?oid=915772"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1""><i>The Chicago Reader</i></span></a> in 2004. “Then I started losing interest in that and started feeling like I wanted to write stuff that only makes sense if I sing it."" A watershed example of this approach is <i>Summerteeth</i>’s ""Via Chicago"", which morphs from a downtrodden ballad to a tumbling feedback squall while Tweedy nonchalantly dreams of murder. It's not a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> song, or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a> song, or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a> song. It is a Jeff Tweedy song, a Wilco song. The track is rightly included in <i>What’s Your 20?</i>, though the early demo of it featured on <i>Alpha </i>is just a static, stepping-stone take that Tweedy himself calls ""sad and miserable.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">A huge factor going into Wilco’s ever-changing sound throughout their first decade was the band’s ever-changing lineup. For instance, the change from <i>Summerteeth</i>’s maximalism to the focused austerity of <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> can in part be attributed to the band recruiting known experimenter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O’Rourke</a> to mix <i>Foxtrot</i> at the same time as they were losing touch with multi-instrumentalist, producer, and overdub impresario <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/329-jay-bennett/"">Jay Bennett</a>. Later on, Bennett’s ouster would lead Tweedy to flex his lead-guitar muscle on the brilliant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8680-a-ghost-is-born/""><i>A Ghost Is Born</i></a>. And it’s this middle period filled with personnel switches and personal tumult—<i>Summerteeth</i>, <i>Foxtrot</i>, and <i>Ghost</i>—that still stands as their greatest work.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Considering <i>Foxtrot</i>’s lofty status within the history of Wilco—along with its sign-of-the-times label drama, it’s still their best-selling album by a wide margin—it is somewhat underrepresented on <i>Alpha</i>. The box set boasts a few relatively well-known outtakes, but in light of <i>Foxtrot</i>’s painstaking gestation, which had the band trying songs out in many different styles to see what stuck, it would have been interesting to hear a few previously unreleased attempts at those beloved tracks.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The material culled from Wilco’s ambitious and fruitful time making and playing <i>Ghost</i> is more substantial, peaking with three consecutive 2004 live tracks featuring their fleshed-out six-man incarnation, which remains intact to this day: 10-minute motorik blast ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"", eerie deal-with-the-devil update ""Hell Is Chrome"", and the monolithic and bipolar ""At Least That’s What You Said"" all spotlight Tweedy’s stunning distorted guitar work—oddly one of the band’s most underutilized assets—which combines the majesty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11853-marquee-moon-adventure/"">Television’s <i>Marquee Moon</i></a> with the spontaneity of free jazz great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/184-albert-ayler/"">Albert Ayler</a>. The sheer emotional audacity of these solos cannot be overstated; 21st-century rock guitar does not get better than this. After figuring out how to get the most out of abstracting his lyrics and arrangements on <i>Foxtrot</i>, Tweedy did himself one better by eliminating language altogether on large swaths of <i>Ghost</i>, replacing it with six-string bursts that said just as much, if not more.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Whereas material from the first five Wilco albums make up the lion’s share of <i>Alpha</i>, the band’s last three records are only represented by about a dozen tracks, which seems about right. Because while those albums, especially 2007’s earthy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10219-sky-blue-sky/""><i>Sky Blue Sky</i></a>, contain great individual songs, they don’t coalesce the way Wilco’s best albums do.

""You already know the story, the chords are just the same,"" he sings, accompanied by strums and warbling cassette ambience. ""You already know I love you, now I sound like what's-his-name.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">When he recorded the demo of ""Someone Else’s Song"", Tweedy was entering a scary new phase of his musical—and personal—life after the dissolution of alt-country heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4416-uncle-tupelo/"">Uncle Tupelo</a>, in which he mostly played second fiddle to fellow frontman Jay Farrar. And in 1995, the same year the demo was originally released, the then-28-year-old became a new husband and father, with little name recognition and no discernible life skills other than writing and singing songs. But even on that imperfect artifact, a lot of what would later define Tweedy as an artist was apparent: the casualness, the anxiety, the almost-uncomfortable sincerity. Meanwhile, the randomness of the recorded-over cassette’s pops and hisses could be heard as an accidental precursor to the unplanned abstractions that would later elevate Wilco to the realm of America’s most innovative rock bands. So just as the early take on ""Someone Else’s Song"" catches a vulnerable songwriter at an especially vulnerable moment, its overall message is resolute, with Tweedy spinning his referential concerns into confidence: ""You can't stop me, I want you to know/ I know it sounds like someone else's song, from a long time ago.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Both <i>Alpha Mike Foxtrot</i> and the 38-song <i>What’s Your 20?</i> best-of compilation offer compelling timelines of Wilco’s unlikely evolution from somewhat-generic roots rockers, to quasi-pop studio mad men, to soothsaying rock’n’roll deconstructionists, to spasmodic guitar adventurers, to epiphanic jammers, to a comfortable, if less exciting, combination of all those previous guises. <i>What’s Your 20? </i>is for the neophytes—it’s a very reasonable place to start for future generations facing down Wilco’s full catalog on Spotify. <i>Alpha </i>is for the die-hards, the ones who may have a yellowing ticket stub from the band’s fall 2001 tour in a drawer somewhere, who know all the words without thinking, who want to live through this band once again, but in a skewed, newish way.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Every track isn’t some kind of lost classic, and not just because every track has already been released in some form, whether as a B-side, on a soundtrack, or via the band’s website. Even Tweedy himself acknowledges some of the lesser moments here with off-the-cuff, generally-on-point track-by-track liner notes: He describes a scattershot remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8677-summer-teeth/""><i>Summerteeth</i></a>’s ""A Shot in the Arm"" by David Kahne (aka the guy who rejected <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8676-yankee-hotel-foxtrot/""><i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i></a> and dropped Wilco from Reprise Records) as ""a dated mess [that] doesn’t have anything to do with the feeling that I had about the song,"" and confesses that the horny, cringe-worthy ""Old Maid"" is drummer ""Glenn Kotche’s least favorite song in the entire Wilco oeuvre."" Running nearly five hours, <i>Alpha</i> plays like a clearinghouse more than a finely-edited set but, largely thanks to its bevy of well-chosen live tracks, its sidelong view of Wilco is worth a peek.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Though Tweedy first gained attention as an acolyte of classic country and folk, it’s his penchant for upending convention that has proven to be most enduring. This restlessness was there from the beginning; though Uncle Tupelo were known for their reverence to songwriting tradition, they also weren’t afraid to bust out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1silCo8FKI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a blitzing punk version of ""Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door""</a>—or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWn5B1FE3fU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a country take on the Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a>. <i>Alpha </i>highlights this rip-‘em-up aesthetic early on with two versions of the small-town ode ""Passenger Side"", from Wilco’s 1995 debut, <i>A.M.</i>; the first jangles and twangs tastefully while the second turns the song into a pop-punk screecher in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"">Replacements</a> mold.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This contrarian strategy—taking a quiet song and exploding it live, or vice versa—offered a way for Wilco to make their early songs, along with the band itself, more slippery and less susceptible to pigeonholing. Another great example of this from <i>Alpha</i> is an aching guitar-and-piano take on <i>A.M.</i>’s ""Box of Letters"", which reveals the hurt underneath the kiss-off’s biting album version while reminding us of the warmth of Tweedy’s determined shrug of a voice. Eventually, the band figured out how to combine its multiple musical personalities within one song as Tweedy delved further into himself to tease-out a fresh kind of indirect writing based on improvisation and subconscious connection.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""For a long time, I thought if I wrote a song that anybody could sing, I'd succeeded,"" he told <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/wilco-are-we-out-of-the-woods-yet/Content?oid=915772"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1""><i>The Chicago Reader</i></span></a> in 2004. “Then I started losing interest in that and started feeling like I wanted to write stuff that only makes sense if I sing it."" A watershed example of this approach is <i>Summerteeth</i>’s ""Via Chicago"", which morphs from a downtrodden ballad to a tumbling feedback squall while Tweedy nonchalantly dreams of murder. It's not a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> song, or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a> song, or a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a> song. It is a Jeff Tweedy song, a Wilco song. The track is rightly included in <i>What’s Your 20?</i>, though the early demo of it featured on <i>Alpha </i>is just a static, stepping-stone take that Tweedy himself calls ""sad and miserable.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">A huge factor going into Wilco’s ever-changing sound throughout their first decade was the band’s ever-changing lineup. For instance, the change from <i>Summerteeth</i>’s maximalism to the focused austerity of <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> can in part be attributed to the band recruiting known experimenter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O’Rourke</a> to mix <i>Foxtrot</i> at the same time as they were losing touch with multi-instrumentalist, producer, and overdub impresario <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/329-jay-bennett/"">Jay Bennett</a>. Later on, Bennett’s ouster would lead Tweedy to flex his lead-guitar muscle on the brilliant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8680-a-ghost-is-born/""><i>A Ghost Is Born</i></a>. And it’s this middle period filled with personnel switches and personal tumult—<i>Summerteeth</i>, <i>Foxtrot</i>, and <i>Ghost</i>—that still stands as their greatest work.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Considering <i>Foxtrot</i>’s lofty status within the history of Wilco—along with its sign-of-the-times label drama, it’s still their best-selling album by a wide margin—it is somewhat underrepresented on <i>Alpha</i>. The box set boasts a few relatively well-known outtakes, but in light of <i>Foxtrot</i>’s painstaking gestation, which had the band trying songs out in many different styles to see what stuck, it would have been interesting to hear a few previously unreleased attempts at those beloved tracks.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The material culled from Wilco’s ambitious and fruitful time making and playing <i>Ghost</i> is more substantial, peaking with three consecutive 2004 live tracks featuring their fleshed-out six-man incarnation, which remains intact to this day: 10-minute motorik blast ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"", eerie deal-with-the-devil update ""Hell Is Chrome"", and the monolithic and bipolar ""At Least That’s What You Said"" all spotlight Tweedy’s stunning distorted guitar work—oddly one of the band’s most underutilized assets—which combines the majesty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11853-marquee-moon-adventure/"">Television’s <i>Marquee Moon</i></a> with the spontaneity of free jazz great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/184-albert-ayler/"">Albert Ayler</a>. The sheer emotional audacity of these solos cannot be overstated; 21st-century rock guitar does not get better than this. After figuring out how to get the most out of abstracting his lyrics and arrangements on <i>Foxtrot</i>, Tweedy did himself one better by eliminating language altogether on large swaths of <i>Ghost</i>, replacing it with six-string bursts that said just as much, if not more.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Whereas material from the first five Wilco albums make up the lion’s share of <i>Alpha</i>, the band’s last three records are only represented by about a dozen tracks, which seems about right. Because while those albums, especially 2007’s earthy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10219-sky-blue-sky/""><i>Sky Blue Sky</i></a>, contain great individual songs, they don’t coalesce the way Wilco’s best albums do. Perhaps the stability of their lineup has made it harder for them to make exciting left turns, or maybe Tweedy grew tired of constantly pushing himself and his audience to uncomfortable places. Even the singer himself recently <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/16312-jeff-tweedy-wilco-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted</a> that their last record, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15856-wilco/""><i>The Whole Love</i></a>, ""was taken for granted a little bit, not necessarily by critics, maybe by ourselves."" After 20 years of Wilco, Tweedy is seemingly no longer vexed by the prospect of overcoming someone else’s song—though surpassing his own is only getting tougher.</p></div>"|19955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19955-wilco-alpha-mike-foxtrot-rare-tracks-19942014whats-your-20-essential-tracks-19942014/|8.0|Ryan Dombal

Aside from an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10375-dylanesque/"">ill-advised collection of Dylan covers</a> in 2007, his recorded output generally represents a series of assured steps forward. His last record, 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17383-the-jazz-age/""><i>The Jazz Age</i></a>, allowed Ferry to play around with big band takes on his expansive back catalog, a project that could have potentially been dismal (and unnecessary), but instead came off as both fun and surprisingly inspired. Now, nearly a year later, Ferry releases<i> Avonmore</i>—his 15th solo album and his first collection of new songs in nearly four years.</p>
<p>On <i>Avonmore</i>, Ferry enlists the help of an all-star cast of players and producers—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29395-nile-rodgers/"">Nile Rodgers</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"">Johnny Marr</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea_(musician)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flea</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3908-ronnie-spector/"">Ronnie Spector</a>, <a href=""Mark%20Knopfler"">Mark Knopfler</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3254-maceo-parker/"">Maceo Parker</a>. With the exception of Rodgers (whose graceful guitar work pops up all over the record) and Terje, most of the special guests are all but invisible on <i>Avonmore</i>, their presence muted by Ferry’s unmistakable voice and the lush production. As Ferry has become known increasingly for his impeccable covers, it’s refreshing that <i>Avonmore</i> is comprised almost exclusively of original material, most of which hearkens back to his most classic sounds.</p>
<p>Some of the tracks could have drifted off of one of Ferry’s mid-'80s solo records. ""Loop de Li"" and ""Midnight Train"" come complete with tastefully employed chimes and a smattering of low key horns. Both are dark and romantic with the kind of breathless quality that only Ferry can offer. Going even further, ""A Special Kind of Guy"" is so intensely Ferry-ish that it borders on parody, as he croons ""When you’re with me every problem seems to disappear/ Fields of roses burst into flower and everyone a tear."" Almost no one else could get away with this, but Ferry manages to sell it perfectly almost every time.</p>
<p><i>Avonmore</i> flounders when the music, which routinely flirts with a kind of adult contemporary smoothness, leans over into blandness. Co-written by Johnny Marr, ""Soldier of Fortune"" would be forgettable were it not for Ferry’s tremulous voice, which manages to make a line like ""Girl stop rockin, you’re driving me insane"" sound more compelling than it actually is. ""Driving Me Wild"" and ""Lost"", while not terrible, lack the surging mystique of the record’s better songs, while ""One Night Stand"" mines '80s tropes in the worst possible way—honking sax, a chorus of sassed up backup singers, and an un-funky Ferry going on about tiger skin rugs. It nearly negates all the amorous glamour that makes the rest of the record such a delicious swoon.</p>
<p>The two covers on <i>Avonmore</i> provide some of the weirdest surprises. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOZhmsp6iBQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Sondheim’s ""Send in the Clowns""</a> could have been rendered as a bit of grandly devastating melodrama, but instead gets mostly buried under a load of damp electronica. While it’s admirable that Ferry might give the venerable bit of camp a modern spin, the end result is something limp and mostly drama-free. He has more success with his cover of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_SAMrDnXOE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Palmer’s ""Johnny and Mary""</a>—a collaboration with Norwegian producer Todd Terje that first appeared on Terje’s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19148-todd-terje-its-album-time/""><i>It’s Album Time </i></a>earlier this year. It’s one of the album’s most gorgeous moments, a melancholic ode to romantic ennui that actually allows Ferry to sound his age.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Avonmore</i> is a fine addition to Bryan Ferry’s oeuvre, if not necessarily a terribly challenging one. At this point, Ferry’s well-documented good taste is both an asset and possibly a curse. While this new record is slick and often quite lovely—recalling '80’s masterworks like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_and_Girls_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Boys and Girls</i></a> or <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%AAte_Noire_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bête Noire</a></i>—one can’t help but wish that Ferry might go spend a little more time in the studio with someone like Terje. His voice remains one of the most singular and finely-honed sounds in popular music, it would just be nice to hear it dropped into new settings more often.</p></div>"|19981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19981-avonmore/|6.7|T.

Some have reminisced about the good old inconvenient days (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a>’s ""We Used to Wait"") while others have refused to see any potential benefits from people talking to one another on Twitter (David Eggers). This year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29348-ema/"">EMA</a> entered the conversation with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19208-ema-the-futures-void/""><i>The Future’s Void</i></a>, but her otherwise solid music was marred by awkward lyrical references to the ""interwebs"" and ""selfies."" Just this month, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a> (or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32587-parkay-quarts/"">Parkay Quarts</a>) released a song called ""Content Nausea"" whose message boils down to ""the Internet is not good."" It’s a topic worth exploring, but one that comes with a lot of pitfalls.</p>
<p>Looking at the track titles on Tokyo duo Jesse Ruins’ latest album, <i>Heartless</i>, it appears they’re devoting their second full-length to confronting the social-media-saturated world of 2014. Songs include ""She Is in Instagram"", ""Forgot Your Account"", and ""URL Sinking"" among others, but <i>Heartless</i> avoids trying to make a statement in favor of capturing what a digitally soaked life is like. It’s a jarring listen, as the pair of Nobuyuki Sakuma and Naho Imajima move from lush synth-pop to aggressive dance sounds, puncturing songs with sudden vocal touches. <i>Heartless</i> is a work shaped by the mad pace of the Internet.</p>
<p>The project wasn't originally concerned with the real world. Sakuma created Jesse Ruins in 2011 to make woozy music blurring the line between dream-pop and dance; though they remained on the edges of the Japanese scene, tracks like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSmwRNkRKQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dream Analysis""</a> caught the attention of Western music blogs and New York label <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>, who released an EP compiling their earliest songs. After releasing their debut last year on <a href=""http://www.lefserecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lefse Records</a>, though, they went in a slightly different direction. Sakuma <a href=""http://publicrhythm.com/13212"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Japanese site Public Rhythm</a> earlier this month that his group’s earlier material explored fantasies, while <i>Heartless</i> would be more conscious of the world around them.</p>
<p>This shift doesn’t erase all the sonic tricks Nobuyuki and Imajima have developed, though. As escapist as songs like ""Dream Analysis"" could get, there was also always a shadowy element lurking underneath the shine. They use one specific technique from that song—overlapping Imajima’s voice with a lower-pitched, throaty vocal—on early <i>Heartless</i> number ""L for App"", a rumbling number that achieves further unease by repeating a second-long sound of a person moaning. Jesse Ruins’ get a lot out of voices emerging from the ether, highlighted on the skeletal ""Empty TL"", wherein barely audible murmurs float in like lonely echoes.</p>
<p><i>Heartless</i> keep you on your toes, switching between meditative and aggressive. The latter take heavy cues from Sakuma’s early interest in dance, and in cases like ""Eat a Holy Monitor"", the music is squelchy acid house turned suffocating. A late run of floor-oriented cuts end up being the album’s weak point, though, as Jesse Ruins let unremarkable grooves such as ""Eat a Heartless Monitor"" and ""Click Raw"" go on too long. <i>Heartless</i> works best when moving frequently between styles and speed, sometimes on the same song, such as the fast-paced-but-melancholic ""ILAifS"" or the skittering ""404nf"".</p>
<p>Even though it doesn’t aim for any grand statements, <i>Heartless</i>’ shifty nature manages to reflect a balanced view of what an online-oriented world is like. There are moments of claustrophobia and of loneliness (""Forgot Your Account"" might be the saddest song to make you think of a ""forgot your password?"" link), and lots of hints of something more menacing lurking in the distance. Yet Jesse Ruins can also get dreamy, as on late optimistic slow burns ""Truth of D"" and ""URL Sinking"". If Sakuma and Imajima set out to not take a hardline stance but rather reflect web-intertwined life, <i>Heartless</i> succeeds thanks to its multiple sonic directions, which often spill over onto one another. It makes for a multi-dimensional listen that rarely trips over itself.</p></div>"|19989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19989-jesse-ruins-heartless/|7.0|Patrick St. Michel

It’s easy—and fun—to stomp your feet to old-timey tunes, but when their circling figures are repeated at length, the catchy gradually becomes the hypnotic. Many musicians have recognized this potential and mined it brilliantly—think of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"">John Fahey</a> matching country-blues fingerpicking to Indian ragas, or the twangy held-tones of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1611-henry-flynt/"">Henry Flynt</a>’s ""avant-garde hillbilly"" style.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Early in their now 21-year career, Virginia band </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelt_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pelt</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> similarly gravitated toward the mesmerizing possibilities of Applachian-influenced drone. In 2006, they added banjo player Nathan Bowles, presumably because he shared that sensibility. That common approach subsequently shone through on his 2012 solo debut </span><i><a href=""http://www.softabuse.com/catalog.php?catno=SAB058"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Bottle, A Buckeye</a></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, and it’s even brighter on his follow-up, </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Nansemond</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. Its seven tracks aren’t all extended loops; a few are more succint songs with vocals, and there’s sonic variety everywhere. But the core of the album is a fascination with entrancing repetition.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the best instances, Bowles sounds like he could play forever without boring himself or anyone listening. He attacks his strings boldly and sharply, yet he continually adds small variations and minute adjustments, viewing each iteration of a chord or phrase from a slightly different angle. This subtly-evolving consistency creates an intriguing blend of comfort and tension. You can settle your ears into Bowles’ grooves, or you can lean to the edge of your seat wondering what little shift will come next. Often, you can do both at the same time.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Bowles places his longest explorations at the beginning and end of </span><i>Nansemond</i><span>, and they serve as the album’s high points. ""Sleepy Lake Bike Club"" opens with a low, echoing tone and some deliberate chords, before launching into six minutes of energetic plucks and strums. Even though he hews to a form, Bowles intuitively feels his way around those melodic paces rather than dryly executing them. At the other end of </span><i>Nansemond</i><span>, ""Golden Floaters/Hog Jank"" is patient and halting in a way that puts you in the passenger seat next to Bowles, while the spry chords of ""Sleepy Lake Tire Swing"" escalate into a passage played so fast it feels maniacally possessed.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">In between, Bowles offers a gruffly crooned ditty, a fiddle-heavy hoedown, and a folk </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/paradise-of-bachelors/4-chuckatuck"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">piece</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> that morphs into a rock journey with searing electric guitar from </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/897-charalambides/"">Charalambides</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">’ Tom Carter. All of those strands are united by Bowles’ dedication to repetition, as well as his knack for making everything intensely percussive even when no drums are present. (Bowles was a drummer before he joined the more-traditional-sounding Pelt side project </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30992-black-twig-pickers/"">Black Twig Pickers</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, who convinced him to take up banjo.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Bowles titled </span><i>Nansemond </i><span>after a near-extinct Indian tribe; he grew up next to a river in Virginia that adopted their name. The word represents lots of complex history, and one could surely make parallels between that textured legacy and the many nuances in Bowles’ music. But it’s also fitting to just think of this record as a musical river—a flowing body of work that’s dependably solid and rippling with variation. For Bowles, the rich potential of simple traditions is as crucial as the water that fills a stream.</span></p></div>"|19919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19919-nathan-bowles-nansemond/|7.2|Marc Masters

He's by no means a novelty act, however; Turnbull takes underground art seriously and literally, releasing spooky, risen-from-the-grave albums like <i>A Hound at the Hem</i> that feature multi-layered, sophisticated pop songs mired in misdirection and haunted-house trickery.</p>
<p>When he was <a href=""http://nowtoronto.com/music/thin-man/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the toast of Toronto</a> a few years ago, Slim Twig was an intriguing cultural cross between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46537-here-we-go-magic-pick-up-hitchhiking-john-waters/"">John Waters</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vincent Price</a>, and <a href=""http://www.genepitney.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gene Pitney</a>—high-minded, campy, and playful enough to draw us into his surreal world of rockabilly blues and horror. A precocious theatre kid at the time (his parents are filmmakers Ross Turnbull and Jennifer Hazel; he himself played Ellen Page’s love interest in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp2wReLorog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Tracey Fragments</i></a>), he took as much care of his visual persona—a nattily dressed, pompadour-sporting crypt-keeper—as he did his music. However divisive, he was Canada’s great grey hope for an unlikely moment, shielding us from the restless, driving spirt within.</p>
<p>His work has drawn comparisons to wily shape-shifters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22521-the-birthday-party/"">The Birthday Party</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"">David Lynch</a>, all of whom have certainly drawn power from the same hair-raising darkness that feeds Slim Twig. He recorded <i>A Hound at the Hem</i> in 2010 but shelved it in favor of a more palatable album called <i>Sof’ Sike</i>. Apparently <i>Hound</i>’s edgy, mind-altering textures were a bit much for anyone accustomed to the comparably direct, accessible releases he'd dispatched up to this point. For all of his slick grit, nothing seemed to spook him and his business associates as much as the enigmatic <i>A Hound at the Hem</i>, which, after a small self-released run in 2012, is finally reaching a wider audience via <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a>. </p>
<p>The record starts so beautifully with ""Heavy Splendour""'s soothing string arrangement by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a> and executed by St. Kitt’s string quartet. But the progression deliberately goes awry. Turnbull’s penchant for dramatically off-kilter musical flourishes and gestures means that an infectious pop progression is often perverted and unsettled; some kind of howling, dissatisfied specter possesses each song’s eerie  soundscape.</p>
<p><i>A Hound at the Hem</i> has been framed as a call-back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"">Serge Gainsbourg</a> and Jean-Claude Vannier's 1971 masterpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12852-histoire-de-melody-nelson/""><i>Histoire de Melody Nelson</i></a>, which is a loose but orchestral concept record inspired by Vladmir Nabokov’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Lolita</i></a>. Turnbull’s adaptation of his source material is distorted and murky, barely articulating notions of ill-advised romance before reflecting them in a funhouse mirror. He adopts different voices, calling and responding with himself, as he utters mostly indecipherable lyrics. Rather than firm intent, he primarily conveys foreboding attitude and an outsider’s cold-as-ice swagger. On ""Clerical Collar"", he sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7064-jim-morrison/"">Jim Morrison</a> fronting a production of <a href=""http://www.rockyhorror.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i></a>, strains of ""L.A. Woman"" seeping through with a creepy choir of low and high voices emerging during every chorus.</p>
<p><i>A Hound at the Hem </i>is a twilight zone of madness and provocation. As the album unfolds, Slim Twig rarely ever sounds like the same guy, each song (hell, each verse) presenting multiple personalities and tones of expression. Its hard-psych is ugly, alluring carnival music that warps and melts before us just as we begin to trust it. Through it all though, there’s an undercurrent of humor and fun; Turnbull’s active imagination stretches out for miles and he comes across as a twisted visionary on his most accomplished album yet.</p></div>"|19979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19979-slim-twig-a-hound-at-the-hem/|7.7|Vish Khanna

License plate: ANGELNN. If her teased platinum wig or volleyball breasts led you to mistake her for a pornographic Dolly Parton, her true identity could be confirmed by the ubiquitous advertisements for herself that she purchased on billboards and bus shelters. Even though practically no one could tell you what she did or had done, she became an '80s Southern California fixture as iconic and purely ornamental as the palm trees—the sunshine daydream to Elvira’s ghoulish noir.  The tragedy is that she peaked before Bravo. Without a reality show to channel the day-to-day eccentricities of Angelyne and her candy-dyed Maltese, the O.G. avatar of ""famous for being famous"" had to settle for a bit part in <i>Earth Girls Are Easy</i>, a brief <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz12brrtrb4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gubernatorial run</a>, and a self-released album on her Pink Kitten imprint.  </p>
<p>In a city where <a href=""http://ktla.com/2014/10/22/caught-on-video-character-brawl-erupts-on-hollywood-blvd-chewbacca-freddy-krueger-try-to-break-it-up/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Incredible brawls with Batgirl while Chewbacca and Freddy Krueger vainly break it up</a>, Angelyne naturally still finds work in the meet-n-greet racket. Her most recent appearance was yesterday at Origami Records in Echo Park, as part of Ariel Pink’s ""Tantalising [sic] Tinsel-Town Take Over."" Should you have missed the mass email, the promotional docket for Ariel Pink’s latest schlock-opus <i>Pom Pom </i>included ""Delicious Donuts and Delectable Ditties""; ""Pretty in Pink. Permanently"" (where ""L.A.’s top manicure artists"" did nails in only pink); and the ""Luxuriously 'L.A.' Limo Listening Luau"". The latter offered a ""ride in style"" to ""enjoy L.A.'s finest sites"" in a ""pink stretch job."" RSVP did not guarantee entrance. </p>
<p>It’s usually over-simplistic to extrapolate from a marketing scheme, but in Ariel Pink as with Angelyne, the medium is the message. The campy flair, smirking irony, and deliberately ""retrolicious"" alliteration matches the scarecrow-genius of his new album, <i>Pom Pom.</i> By wheeling out the inflatable mummy of Angelyne, the former Ariel Rosenberg wryly casts himself as her timeless prom date in the Hollywood Babylon of conniving prophets, sexualized excess, and sterling self-mythologizers.  </p>
<p>A decade ago, Pink crept out of his rented room in an ashram off Crenshaw with reels of spindly, self-destructing love songs. Issued on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a>’s <a href=""http://www.paw-tracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paw Tracks</a> imprint, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6553-the-doldrums/""><i>The Doldrums</i></a> (and later <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6554-worn-copy/""><i>Worn Copy</i></a>) inspired chillwave and a lo-fi revival, as well as altering the perception of L.A. as an indie-rock backwater. Pink was the sunshine and noir dialect rolled into one, writing gorgeous heat-warped AM pop made to soundtrack driving off of a cliff on Mulholland or save an animal from drowning in a shimmering David Hockney swimming pool. </p>
<p>The intervening years have seen him transform from wraith to wolf. The romantic cult hero fantasies have given way to headlines that he’s the <a href=""https://myspace.com/article/2014/10/14/ariel-pink-madonna-manager-grimes-misogynistic-comments-twitter-feud"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""most hated man in indie rock.""</a> The analog necessity of his early work has been replaced by studio sheen, alienating those inclined towards the cassette hiss and rawness of his first wave. Pink’s compared social media vilification to the Rwandan genocide, dated porn stars, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57467-ariel-pink-calls-grimes-stupid-and-retarded/"">called Grimes ""stupid and retarded""</a> and scored <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52181-ariel-pink-scores-werewolf-movie-bad-vibes-produced-by-elijah-wood-and-john-landis/"">a werewolf film</a>—inevitably empathizing with the antagonist.</p>
<p>If you hate Ariel Pink, nothing in this review can possibly alter your opinion. You’ll scour the record for misogyny, say it’s too long, and roll your eyes at the helium disco-grooves about getting white freckles at the tanning salon and the amphetamine jingles for Jell-O. You think he’s funny or you don’t. If you do, the best engagement is one of suspended disbelief. After all, the CalArts alumnus remains the stylistic next-of-kin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4742-frank-zappa/"">Frank Zappa</a>: satirical, divisive, and more interested in terraforming genres than neatly deconstructing them. </p>
<p>But for all the arch humor and affectation, Pink writes some of most wistful and peculiarly moving songs in contemporary music. ""Put Your Number in My Phone"" feels like David Crosby covering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWYRFSPbKVs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2Pac’s ""What’z Ya Phone #""</a>. Despite the '60s Sunset Strip jangle, the terrain shifts to the Eastside, a Silver Lake taco truck where Pink sweetly begs for the chance to get to know a girl better, before promptly blowing her off—which we hear in uncomfortably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>-ian Voicemail detail. It’s the paradox at the heart of the collection and what ultimately makes it so compelling. Beyond catchy melodies, there’s a constant agitation between Pink’s moonlit dreams and everyday pessimism. He wants to be the romantic lover of fiction, but turns out to be just another undependable disappointment—but at least he admits it.</p>
<p>There’s ""Sexual Athletics"", where the sleazoid of the first half makes preposterous pull-your-dick-out boasts about being the ""Sex King on a velvet swing/ Waiting for my Alice in Wonderland."" The coda descends into lo-fi clatter and a tender, Four Seasons-falsetto about his life-long desire for a girlfriend. The ironic shell is always there, lest you get too close to treating the songs like journal entries, but the emotions remain conflicted and unconcealed. </p>
<p>If 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16936-mature-themes/""><i>Mature Themes</i></a> found him recovering from a break-up by concocting<i> Kinski Assassin Who Shagged Me</i> daydreams during hungover wanderings to the Highland Park Wienerschnitzel, <i>Pom Pom</i> is Pink on the prowl—with its attendant sexploits and screwups. Sometimes, the tales are in villainous character. ""Four Shadows"" recasts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/""><i>Station to Station</i>-era<i> </i>David Bowie</a> as a comically morbid goth. ""Black Ballerina"" chronicles the night that ""One-Eyed Willie"" took ""Shotgun Billy"" to L.A.’s finest strip club for his first (short-lived) exotic dance experience. ""Lipstick"" concerns a predatory pick-up artist flashing his teeth and threatening to suck a girl into his darkness. There are new wave synthesizers, demands to be showered in blood, and Pink’s best <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKDYyFf1s0I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hey Little Girl""</a> baritone. It might be the finest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a> song since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa2nLEhUcZ0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Friday I’m in Love""</a>.</p>
<p>Other times, there’s no need for subterfuge. The album’s finale, ""Dayzed Inn Daydreams"", refurbishes an old track from <i>Odditties Sodomies Vol. 1</i> with unnatural poignancy. The goofy voices and bipolar shifts are jettisoned for a straightforward psych-pop song in the vein of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11429-forever-changes-collectors-edition/"">Love’s <i>Forever Changes</i></a>. It’s difficult not to read as a veiled statement of purpose: an anachronism to when his greatest fear was dying young and anonymous, a musical John Kennedy Toole, with hundreds of unheard songs his only hope for posthumous recognition.  </p>
<p>The rest of the songs comprise crooked detours through Pink’s hometown. Fellow passengers include: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12882-kim-fowley/"">Kim Fowley</a>, the immemorial L.A. gadfly who played ""hypophone"" on <i>Freak Out!,</i> co-wrote with Warren Zevon, and managed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27645-the-runaways/"">the Runaways</a>; Don Bolles, the drummer from the Germs; novelist Alex Kazemi (""Not Enough Violence""), and producer/writer Justin Raisen (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"">Charli XCX</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30673-sky-ferreira/"">Sky Ferreira</a>).</p>
<p>But the zigzags and bizarre pit stops are clearly at Pink’s behest. Opening track ""Plastic Raincoats in the Pig Parade"" finds him hallucinating cocaine banks, Tokyo nights, and Arkansas moons over what sounds like psychedelic Ringling Bros. polka. ""Dinosaur Carebears"" riffs on Syrian wedding music, shifts to a Tweedledum and Tweedledee melody, and then finds Pink role-calling random L.A. neighborhoods: Tarzana, Reseda, the City of Industry, Beverly Hiiiiiiilllls. Finally, the groove switches to a cosmic space dub.</p>
<p>This is no haven for conventional logic or normative restraint. ""Negativ Ed"" is pure Zappa homage, a gym class anthem for delinquent rebels in an '80s B-movie. It’s ridiculous and superfluous, but also endearingly whimsical. The same goes for ""Nude Beach a Go-Go"", a time warp to the Malibu surf rock of the Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello era. But unlike the beach blanket bingo wholesomeness of the censored past, Pink reimagines it as the nude mating ritual it probably was.</p>
<p>One of Pink’s strongest gifts is making the absurd seem real and the real seem absurd. If this album has a closest predecessor in his catalog, it might be <i>Worn Copy</i>, with its weary refrain that ""life in L.A. is so lonely."" His coping strategy remains a rich fantasy life, of which he’s occasionally the star and sometimes the sardonic observer. You can see it on ""Picture Me Gone"", a haunting meditation about how digital technology will erase all physical evidence of our pasts. Set in the near future, the narrator’s age keeps changing. Even at his most sincere, there is something protean and shifty. Or as Pink seemingly indicts himself on ""One Summer Night"": ""Fantasies and fallacies/ All fairy tales and lies/ Time is running out yeah/ Better write these lines."" Or maybe you prefer ""Exile on Frog Street"", in which Pink does his best karaoke of Jim Morrison circa <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbQ7zyEp2s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Celebration of the Lizard""</a>. The song concerns an ""enchanted frog... waiting for his Princess Charming to come and kiss him on his frog lips."" When the kiss finally comes, the toad turns into Ariel Pink. You hear the fairy tale magic twinkle of a Disney soundtrack. Then you hear a frog’s ribbit.</p>
<p>You can interpret this as another surreal metaphor in his search for enchanted love or chalk it up to a teenaged fixation with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"">the Doors</a>. Maybe a little of both. He can be the frog prince, Shotgun Billy, or ride shotgun in a pink corvette. He can be a rock'n'roller named Ariel from Beverly Hills, complete with his own billboards. And in a place where delusion, self-reinvention, and wish fulfillment have long been the principal cash crop, who are we to tell him otherwise?</p></div>"|19936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19936-ariel-pink-pom-pom/|8.8|Jeff Weiss

Much of the record is outfitted with an electronic throb that wouldn’t sound out of place in the clubs of District 1 (<a href=""http://richkidsofinstagram.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Rich Kids of Instagram</a> in the Hunger Games universe). And, yet, many tracks soar beyond the reasonable expectation of a film soundtrack that would’ve been snapped up by thousands of teenagers even if it were just 81 minutes of off-pitch Mockingjay whistles.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lorde, who’s gone from complete unknown to holding the reins of one of the world’s biggest movie franchises in just 18 months, has assembled a stable of rising stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/"" target=""_blank"">Tinashe</a>, hyper-relevant indie-friendly sensations like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"" target=""_blank"">Chvrches</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32477-raury/"" target=""_blank"">Raury</a>, and more. Tracks like Chvrches' kinetic call-to-arms <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWhEUR0I9fo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dead Air""</a> and Raury's meditative ""Lost Souls"" would have been standouts on their respective debuts. They’re standouts here. There are the emotional highs and stripped-down ballads you might expect to color moods of a specific scene, but the whole record crackles with electricity: Those ballads are just as striking as the more pounding cuts like the opener ""Meltdown"" (Stromae ft. Lorde, Pusha T, Q-Tip and Haim) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31708-ariana-grande/"" target=""_blank"">Ariana Grande</a>'s sky-scraping collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"">Major Lazer</a>, ""All My Love"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Charli XCX connects with Simon Le Bon for the lovely piano ballad ""Kingdom"", an effortlessly composed song co-written with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a>'s Rostam Batmanglij <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9542-charli-xcx/"">after the two got drunk at a Miley Cyrus concert</a>. Lorde's cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Bright Eyes</a>' ""Ladder Song"" is straightforward, but sweet. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">Bat for Lashes</a>' contribution, a cover of Son Lux's ""Plan the Escape"", is a twinkling snowglobe of a song that will almost certainly score a tense moment of Katniss introspection as she mulls over the two hollow clods after her heart (team #SingleKatniss).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After the rustic rock-leaning OST of the first movie, which featured contributions from Arcade Fire, the Decemberists, and Neko Case, the series leans toward electronic pop. Following in the veins of <i>Catching Fire</i>’s OST, <i>Mockingjay</i> moves with the action of a series that began in a hermetically sealed environment before transitioning to a city where every battle has larger implications. Across the board, the songs sound like threads of hope escaping gloomier pasts, echoing the arc of the film's generational heroine. It's no coincidence that, of the 14 songs featured on <i>Mockingjay</i>, 11 feature female vocalists in the foreground. Sure, the lyrical sentiments are often delivered as platitudes—""We’re just a mess of broken people but we love the game!,"" and so forth—but that's part of the deal when you're working with some populist YA lit poking around well-established archetypes. It’s a big, broad tent for everyone to get lost in.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Though lots of distinctive voices are represented on the soundtrack, one person stands out. ""Katniss would be a huge Lorde fan,"" <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/jennifer-lawrence-katniss-huge-lorde-taylor-swift-fan-185654176.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">series star Jennifer Lawrence voiced</a> during the promotional rollout, directly making the connection that the strong, independent Katniss character is an effective muse to the world's most famous teenager. While Lorde's vocals are all over <i>Mockingjay</i>—from the swirling centerpiece ""Yellow Flicker Beat"" (and its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>-tinted Kanye West rework) to supplementary vocals on ""Meltdown"" and a hook to the Miguel/Chemical Brothers collaboration ""This Is Not a Game""—her presence elevates the project; you can feel the other stars on the soundtrack bringing their A-game out of respect for the project's core vision and passion. Though not everything works on its own (the flat electropop of XO's ""Animal"" is one dud) <i>Mockingjay</i> adds up to a fun pastiche of modern sounds. In conclusion,<a href=""http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/katnissgif.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> three fingers out of five</a>.</p></div>"|19909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19909-various-artists-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-ost/|7.8|Corban Goble

Scribbles of distressed electric guitar and waves of distortion grate against scratchily arrhythmic drums, creating a sustained explosion of sound uninterrupted by lyrics or melody. It’s all static and tension, with no release until it fades into the more percussive ""Sioux Lookout"". Listening to ""The End"", it’s almost impossible not to be reminded of Lanois’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39113-daniel-lanois-hurt-in-motorcycle-crash/"">motorcycle crash</a> four years ago, when he lost control of his bike in Los Angeles and ended up in the hospital with multiple broken bones. The song conveys the same sense of slowed time that most of us experience during an accident, a hyperawareness that allows you to take in every small detail. Such associations emphasize the song’s queasy friction: guitar strings against drum heads, bone against asphalt, flesh against machine.</p>
<p>A deft guitarist who gravitates toward the liquid sound of the pedal steel, Lanois plays the studio like it’s just one more instrument, which would be a cliché if he didn’t take the studio on the road with him and produce each show like it’s a new record. More than 30 years after getting his first credits—one of which was a Raffi album, no less—he has become one of the most recognizable names in the control room, collaborating closely with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> and twiddling knobs for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14684-le-noise/"">Le Noise</a></i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>’s <i>Time Out of Mind</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2045-emmylou-harris/"">Emmylou Harris</a>’ <i>Wrecking Ball</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3107-willie-nelson/"">Willie Nelson</a>’s <i>Teatro, </i>and nearly half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"">U2</a>’s catalog (although not their most recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19816-u2-songs-of-innocence/"">catastrophe</a>). But Lanois is less well known as a solo artist, partly because one album per decade isn’t exactly prolific and partly because he has never settled on one particular sound or approach. Instead, he toggles between singer-songwriter fare (like 2003’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4950-shine/"">Shine</a></i>) and blurry, concept-driven soundscapes (2005’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4951-belladonna/"">Belladonna</a></i>).</p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>Flesh &amp; Machine </i>is purely instrumental, with no lyrics to structure it too rigidly and no concept to hem Lanois. There’s an intriguing sense of entropy to these songs; rather than pristine, everything sounds weathered and worn. Like a robot detaching its limbs, ""Tamboura Jah"" actively disassembles itself as you listen, cut-and-pasting its constituent parts into new patterns. The mere act of holding together, though, gives the song its self-propulsion, as the cymbals and guitars reverberate against each other in unexpected ways. Of course <i>Flesh &amp; Machine</i> is going to sound great, with each instrument calibrated either to pull you into Lanois’ sonic world or to shake you up once you get there.</p>
<p>Lanois creates some lovely sounds and moods on <i>Flesh &amp; Machine</i>, but what really sets it apart from his other work is how he sets them against each other. The disembodied vocals on opener ""Rocco"" are pitched high to sound inhuman, lulling you a bit before the jarring conflagration of ""The End"". The album starts strong but picks up considerably on the second side, pitting the ethereal piano of ""Iceland"" with the raking-light nostalgia of ""My First Love"", which sounds like it’s stuck halfway between an old <a href=""http://youtu.be/JvfG9uFswis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Floyd Cramer</a> instrumental and the new <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/518-the-musical-legacy-of-twin-peaks/"">Twin Peaks</a></i> reboot. With its descending piano theme and bossa nova underpinning, it’s exactly the kind of song that would be on the jukebox at the Double R.</p>
<p><i>Flesh &amp; Machine</i> reaches its climax on ""Aquatic"", with its lurid pedal steel gliding like a shark around a reef. Lanois amplifies and exaggerates that lead instrument, not only lending it a supreme fluidity but also distorting its tone, like a microphone held too close to the mouth or an eye pressed right up to the TV screen. Yet, the effect is somehow delicate rather than noisy. It might seem like faint praise to call <i>Flesh &amp; Machine</i> Lanois’ best and most realized solo album, but it’s also one of the best ambient records of 2014—an endlessly inventive collection of songs built on odd, often lurid sounds and textures, somehow rough and gentle at the same time.<i></i></p></div>"|20007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20007-daniel-lanois-flesh-and-machine/|7.7|Stephen M.

It was designed that way—in the <a href=""http://www.tindersticks.co.uk/ypres/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">notes</a> accompanying its release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4245-tindersticks/"">Tindersticks</a> point out how it’s intended to loop all day without ever finding a place of rest. The record is unique in the band’s canon, although it sometimes brushes close to their soundtrack work for French director <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Denis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Claire Denis</a>. <i>Ypres</i> is a commissioned piece, from the <a href=""http://www.inflandersfields.be/en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In Flanders Fields</a> World War One museum in Ypres, Belgium, composed to accompany visitors as they make their way through the institution. The mood is suitably somber and inward facing, with moments of beauty and light scattered throughout. It’s largely the work of two members of Tindersticks, Stuart A. Staples and Dan McKinna, with help from longterm collaborator Lucy Wilkins, who presided over the dense orchestral recordings that give the album its sizeable weight.</p>
<p>Tindersticks possess the enviable ability to work in big and small spaces, combining barely-there minimalist compositions with full-blown orchestral works. <i>Ypres</i> slots into the former category, with silence acting as a key constituent in its makeup. The muted tone creates an air of reverence, of silent contemplation. ""Gueules cassées""—a title that translates as ""broken faces,"" in reference to injury ravaged combat veterans—contains barely any instrumentation at all, other than a solitary wind instrument faintly circling in time. It’s easy to imagine such work providing a perfectly unobtrusive accompaniment to a museum visit, but it works as a standalone piece as well, largely due to the depth and refinement sunk into it. On the fullest track here, ""Sunset Glow"", the lack of complexity allows for notes to stretch out expansively, with the string section interlocking in a way that’s positively hypnotic.</p>
<p>Learning of the history of Ypres, which was virtually destroyed during the Great War, with rebuilding only recently finished, provides clues as to the mindset at work when these pieces were composed. But, shorn of its context, it becomes the type of material that’s easy to impinge other thoughts and feelings on. Notes seem to stretch on for days in the 20-minute-long ""The Third Battle of Ypres"", opening up a framework to cloak an existential crisis in, if you feel so inclined. It’s a powerful, masterfully repetitive piece, containing great sways and sighs of purposefully deadened sound. Sometimes ""Battle"" even feels like it's heading somewhere, gaining form and structure, only for Staples and his cohorts to pull back from the brink, retreating into the haltingly rotating figures that make up the rest of the album. It’s an interesting moment, resembling the more familiar front of this band taking over for a minute or two, before they check where they are and sink back into the solemnity.</p>
<p>A touchstone for <i>Ypres</i> is the soundtrack work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a> produced for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24252-werner-herzog/"">Werner Herzog</a>’s films, not least because of the way these tracks simply appear then vanish without development. But there’s also a similarity in the way the pallid atmosphere is entwined with moments of grace and beauty. On ""Whispering Guns, Parts 1, 2 and 3"", a death-ship bell clangs throughout, scattered drums resemble artillery fire, and strings tenderly see-saw over the top—all combining to create an atmosphere somewhere between unease and elegance. The tools for getting there may be different, but that’s a familiar place to be for this band. One key difference, though, is in Tindersticks’ fondness for taking small moments and blowing them up big. Here, they turn that method inside out, starting with a huge, globe changing event and working something humble around it, making it feel like they’re respectfully cowering in its shadow.</p></div>"|20009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20009-tindersticks-ypres/|6.8|Nick Neyland

A Berlin resident who grew up in the Canadian heartland and was forged as an artist in the crucible of the Montreal music scene, Bodan has a set of pipes more suited to adult contemporary radio than a spot on venerable NYC label DFA; with his rich, resonant tone and particular phrasing, he's a little reminiscent of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Anthony"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marc Anthony</a>. But given the sphere in which Bodan is working, more apt comparisons are the work Tom Krell's doing as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"">How to Dress Well</a>, or perhaps the unvarnished and raw indie-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31231-sean-nicholas-savage/"">Sean Nicholas Savage</a>. Like these artists, Bodan is unafraid to enter sentimental terrain in the pursuit of something radiant and real, and he does so again and again on his debut full-length, <i>Soft</i>.</p>
<p>There’s an impressive diversity to the sound of the album. Covers of jazz standards butt up against drum and bass tracks. Bodan will summon the chintzy spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2293-your-blues/"">Destroyer’s <i>Your Blues</i></a> with a track like dewy opener ""A Soft Opening"", only to pivot into amorphous, cracked soul on highlight ""Anonymous"". All of these detours are linked by that powerful voice, which he pushes to the edge of its capability in several different ways throughout the record. On ""Soft as Rain"", he tests its range and agility over warm, rounded synth tones; one song later, on ""For Heaven’s Sake (Let’s Fall in Love) &lt;3"", he takes a song famously rendered by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5L9WLDKNVw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billie Holiday</a> and performs it with a palpable, unnerving desperation. In his hands, love is a life raft, a dangerous narcotic, a portrait of a partner fractured and faded; by the end of the song, he’s pushing himself in and out of tune and dancing around the beat, as if he’s on the edge of our world. It’s an entrancing, indelible performance, the best of what Bodan has to offer.</p>
<p>Bodan’s approach to vocals—the way he searches out boundaries and then pushes at them—is mirrored in his lyrics, an important part of his cultivation of intimacy on <i>Soft</i>. The album is awash in sensuality, from fraught love stories in miniature like ""Romeo"" and ""Rusty"" to the set of songs revolving around the titular concept of ""softness."" Bodan is fond of imagery that takes physical acts and tempers them, granting them a sort of gentleness—a good example can be found on ""Soft as Rain"", where close contact is reduced to ""You fall on me/ Soft as rain""—and numbers, whether it's seven wasted years (""Soft as Rain"", again) or $50 worth of cheap cologne (""Anonymous""). This dual focus works to give <i>Soft</i> both personality and specificity; it makes the album feel like a true document of Bodan's life and love in recent years. All that said, when the ways Bodan tries to eliminate distance come together—the voice, the lyrics, the rawness of the emotion on display—the final product can induce claustrophobia. The effect is undeniably powerful, but there's a fine line between powerful and overwhelming, and his work should grow more potent as he manages to find a balance between the two.</p></div>"|19992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19992-dan-bodan-soft/|6.2|Jamieson Cox

TV on the Radio, the band that formed there with help from friends in other nearby noisy bands—the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a>—make music that sounds a lot more expensive more than a decade later, but have otherwise moved more toward<i> </i>accessibility than away from it. That’s how music works differently from the market for the real estate where it’s made: while Brooklyn’s been gentrified into the walled-off backdrop for Lena Dunham’s mumblecore Marlo Thomas performance, infinitely <i>more </i>people will have access to TV on the Radio’s fifth album <i>Seeds</i> than the band’s 2004 Touch &amp; Go <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8197-desperate-youth-blood-thirsty-babes/"">debut</a>, exactly <i>because</i> more money has been invested into it. Thankfully, for longtime fans and new listeners alike, though the music might sound pricier than ever, the basic architecture hasn’t really changed at all. </p>
<p>Opening song ""Quartz"" demonstrates that from a production standpoint, the group hasn’t lost its unique ability to conjure a surreal, soulful dread. Everything starts <i>in medias res</i>, as if we’ve been dropped into the middle of a séance in the desert. The handclaps, moaning vocals, and what sounds like a South Asian percussion instrument (it’s <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/arts/music/tv-on-the-radio-releases-a-new-album.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">actually</a> a loop of Sitek dropping a drumstick onto piano strings) sound like a glossier version of ""Satellite"" and ""Staring at the Sun"" from 2003’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8196-young-liars-ep/""><i>Young Liars</i></a> EP, Sitek and Adebimpe still merging lessons drawn from the European-derived NYC avant-garde and centuries of African-American church music. When Adebimpe’s powerhouse vocal comes in, it’s instantly familiar, both as a reminder of the absolute best that the shrunken state of post-millennial rock can produce and the fact that that voice—<i>that voice</i>—can still turn even the most interpersonal utterances into sentiments of galactic force. </p>
<p>Even though it’s meant to signify moving on from a romantic relationship, when Adebimpe keeps rolling out the phrase ""but I should really give it up sometime"" it’s hard not to remember that the past several years for TV on the Radio—as they came down from the impossible peak of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9177-return-to-cookie-mountain/""><i>Return to </i></a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9177-return-to-cookie-mountain/""><i>Cookie Mountain</i></a>—have been marked by different forms of loss. Most crucially, longtime bassist Gerard Smith passed away from cancer days after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15311-nine-types-of-light/""><i>Nine Types of Light</i></a> was released—a huge blow for a tight-knit band. The group also broke from its label Interscope, which pushed <i>Mountain</i> in front of the largest possible audience (this is its first album on legendary '70s prog-rock haven <a href=""http://www.harvestrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harvest</a>). <i>Light</i> also marked the point where TV on the Radio more or less stopped incorporating explicit politics in their lyrics—observational and ironic message tracks like ""Caffeinated Consciousness"" and ""No Future Shock"" (""do the ‘no future’"") felt like an extended ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ after the gospel-powered hopefulness of 2008’s ""Golden Age"", which for more than a few of us was the unofficial theme song of the sadly brief window of hope and change following Obama’s inauguration.</p>
<p><span>So while TV on the Radio peaked from 2006 to 2008, the last two albums feel less like an artistic decline and more like a shift in focus and a lowering of stakes. </span>The lead single from <i>Seeds</i>, accompanied by a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaKVy-FlaUA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> of Paul Reubens doing a <i>Speed Racer</i> knockoff, was ""Happy Idiot"", another song superficially about getting over a relationship that can easily double as an strategy for negotiating an existence over which one’s lost all control. Like much of <i>Seeds</i> as well as its predecessor, ""Idiot"" embraces rhythms derived from the electronic end of the dance music spectrum, and does so as easily as they incorporated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a> skronk and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"">Prince</a> synth funk in the past. Like their best songs, ""Idiot"" works because it balances simple catchiness with urgency and anxiety, like their post-punk forebears taught them: the piston-pumping rhythm section is counterposed against Adebimpe’s tenor, which floats in a dazed murmur for the vocals and upshifts to nervous falsetto for the chorus. This is a Sitek production, of course, and underneath the lustrous exterior he layers a subtle, high-pitched synth drone (a cousin to the menacing washes of distorted guitar that distinguished the band’s early music), which gives the song a sense of creeping dread nearly at an unconscious level.</p>
<p>After <i>Cookie Mountain</i>, as with the followups to so many great records on which a restless band seeks to conquer new territory, Sitek started cleaning up the band’s sound, doing away with its trademark siren-like clamor after <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/tv-radio-david-sitek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">falling for</a> the pristine production of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OFpfTd0EIs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Eyes Without a Face""</a> (listen to that song again and then come back to <i>Light </i>and <i>Seeds</i>. You’ll hear them differently). What’s quietly happened since then is that TV on the Radio have shed the Best Band in the World expectations and simply become a really good anthemic rock band. Check the segue from the neon sizzle of the Gary Numan/Depeche Mode burner ""Careful You"" into the open-hearted jangle boogie of ""Could You"", which achieves the ultra-rare feat of writing a '90s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8692-sugar/"">Sugar</a> chorus as good as the ones <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2842-bob-mould/"">Bob Mould</a> came up with, or the perfectly-executed Ramones bop that introduces late-album track ""Lazerray"". It sounds simple, but shockingly few bands at TV on the Radio's level are able to do it without sounding corny. So while they've long segued from <i>fin-de-siecle </i>Brooklyn to edge-of-the-continent Silver Lake, losing more than they’ve gained along the way, TV on the Radio are still capable of conquering big stages and broad sonic territory with the kind of precision and power for which their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19816-u2-songs-of-innocence/"" target=""_blank"">increasingly</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19864-foo-fighters-sonic-highways/"" target=""_blank"">desperate</a> older contemporaries need to rely on expensive stunts.</p></div>"|20013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20013-tv-on-the-radio-seeds/|7.2|Eric Harvey

Both as one-half of the shadowy duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29386-hype-williams/"">Hype Williams</a> and under his own name, the London-based art-pop provocateur has spent the better part of the last half decade turning out dense keyboard drones, giving intentionally obtuse and combative interviews, and putting on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSLN1yUzdDc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bizarre performance art live shows</a>. But with his latest full-length, it seems he's finally decided to open up, to highlight a love for pop music that's always been somewhere underneath the found sound samples and sub-bass firebombs. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The material Blunt has released since he cut ties with Hype Williams collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32295-copeland/"">Inga Copeland</a> has hewed closer toward pop song structures. And it's clear even from the opening strains of album opener ""Lush""—a straightforward sample of Big Star's sunny-eyed strummer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1e5t8X9kLk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""For You""</a>—that <i>Black Metal </i>is a whole lot more welcoming than past records have been. Blunt pairs Big Star's orchestral sweep with a slowly plodding rhythm section, his own deadpan vocals, and some lazily picked electric guitar parts that wouldn't sound out of place on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a> record. ""Molly &amp; Aquafina""'s narcotized Americana and ""100"", which employs a sample of the Pastels' ""Over Your Shoulder"", similarly value clarity and directness, two qualities absent from much of his preceding work. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even as he jumps from those indie pop touchstones to the genre exercises on the record's second side—the imploded dub of ""Punk"", ""Hush"" and ""Grade""'s dizzy rap deconstructions, the pair of occasionally frigid ambient tracks that make up a 20-minute block at the record's middle—Blunt is able to keep their knotty worlds relatively accessible. Pinned together by a series of keyboard drones, ""Forever"" and ""X"" both employ distant vocalizations from recurring collaborator Joanne Robertson as an easy point of entry amidst their occasionally abstract spheres. These are light moments, airy passages function mostly to separate the lilting first half of the record from the bleak second. But where Blunt would have once used lengthy drone passages to project alienation, here they function as a seam between the two otherwise disjointed album segments.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All of Blunt's work to date—if you're willing to consider his bizarre public character as part of that work—has been wrapped up in questions of identity. He's constantly concealing personal details and controlling the discourse about him to an apparently paranoid degree, and his sonic persona, shaped by distinctly gnarled postmodern experimentation, is as hard to pin down as his image. So what does it mean that for those questions now that he's appearing on the covers of glossy magazines and making pop songs? He's at once a folk pop troubadour and a downcast dub vocalist—a staid ambient composer and a gruff grime MC. He's everything all at once, or maybe he's not much of anything at all. As with everything he does, <i>Black Metal</i> offers few definitive answers, but this time around the hazy images he's projecting have come into sharper focus.</span></p></div>"|20012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20012-dean-blunt-black-metal/|7.3|Colin Joyce

Her audiovisual works <i>bounty</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16722-kin/""><i>kin</i></a> each house a subtle narrative that's more concerned with the movement of figures through space than concrete dramas in the traditional sense. <i>bounty</i> followed Lee through a series of textural transformations as she clawed through the world around her apparently in search of someone tall, bearded, and naked who's stranded in the Scandinavian countryside. <i>kin</i> saw her pass through different environments by enormous sentient shag rugs. Neither album resolved itself cleanly, but both fostered rich tension in music and visuals alike. Her best songs feel like they'd come for your body parts the second you divert your attention from them; thick and mysterious, they resist the usual half-life of boredom that affects songs designed for short-term radio play. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a>, iamamiwhoami threads ghosts through what you thought you knew about the pop song.</p>
<p>Or she did. Compared to <i>kin</i> and <i>bounty</i>'s viscerally unnerving shorts, <i>BLUE</i>'s visuals play out like screensavers. Lee dances in beautiful scenery. Lee fits messages into bottles and casts them out to sea, attempting to communicate with figures in black morphsuits who don't carry nearly the visual weight of her bizarrely disfigured companions from the first two records. The images are lovely but tedious, and the music follows suit. </p>
<p><i>BLUE</i>'s audio component flows on synths that gleam like the ice Lee fondles in its videos, glassy and pale. ""Hunting for Pearls"" ripples with arpeggios that make it sound more uptempo than it actually is, while the bristling bass on ""Tap Your Glass"" sounds like it could have been scraped off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17847-the-knife-shaking-the-habitual/""><i>Shaking the Habitual</i></a>'s cutting room floor. At points the album echoes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna"">Madonna</a>'s <i>Ray of Light</i>, but Lee doesn't quite have the gravitas to pull off these round, easy melodies. She's a songwriter that thrives on danger; <i>BLUE</i> encloses her in a space where she's far too safe.</p>
<p>""Thin"" is the closest iamamiwhoami gets to its old mischief, setting Lee's voice close in the ear over faraway percussion. It's riddled with the same neon arpeggios that take up space everywhere else on the record, but it at least leaves some shadows for Lee to get lost in. It shifts its course halfway through, moving seamlessly from slow stalker to towering ballad. But it's a rare moment of intrigue on an album that's generous in its beauty while leaving little to wonder about, a sky that never rains.</p></div>"|19996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19996-iamamiwhoami-blue/|6.1|Sasha Geffen
